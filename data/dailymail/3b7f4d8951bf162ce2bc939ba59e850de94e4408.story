Eric Cantona has had 20 years to forgive, forget or apologise for the kung-fu kick at Selhurst Park which saw the Frenchman transformed from maverick to madman — but, fittingly, he will not have a bit of it.

Two decades after that moment of insanity, when Cantona launched himself over the advertising hoardings to attack a Crystal Palace fan, he simply said: ‘I didn’t punch him strong enough. I should have punched him harder.’

Anyone who remembers the incident or remembers Cantona, will not be in the least bit surprised by his recollections of one of the most seismic events in Premier League history.

The Frenchman lost his temper in a league match and kicked out at Palace player Richard Shaw. He was shown a red card and as he left the pitch, Cantona blew his top at fan Matthew Simmons who was berating him in the front row of the stands.

Cantona launched himself into the crowd, following up his kick with a volley of punches before being dragged away by stewards.

He was banned for nine months, given 120 hours community service and gave a surreal press conference with references to trawlers and sardines.

Even today, Cantona, 48, sees the episode as a piece of theatre. ‘I played that moment, at Selhurst Park,’ he said, in an interview with FourFourTwo magazine. 

‘It was a drama and I was an actor. I do things seriously without taking myself seriously. I think Nike found that side of my character and used it very well. Even when I kicked the fan, it’s because I don’t take myself seriously.

‘I didn’t think that I had a responsibility not to do it because of who I was. No, I was just a footballer and a man. I don’t care about being some sort of superior person. I just wanted to do whatever I wanted to do. 

'If I want to kick a fan, I do it. I’m not a role model. I’m not a superior teacher, telling you how to behave. I think the more you see, the more you realise that life is a circus.’

He was banned from English football by the FA for eight months and ordered to carry out community service
