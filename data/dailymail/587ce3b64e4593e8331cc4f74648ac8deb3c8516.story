The Vogue writer whose Kate Upton profile was knocked off its intended cover story spot in favor of the now infamous Kim Kardashian and Kanye West cover, has spoken out.

According to the New York Post, Jonathan Van Meter took to his Facebook page to smugly post a review of the controversial Vogue issue, in which his story is declared 'the jewel,' of the April edition.

'After getting bumped from the cover of April Vogue for Kimye and finding out only once it hit newsstands, I think I have earned the right to post this little bit of frothy praise,' Mr Van Meter wrote, making a dig at the fact that he was the last to know of the last minute change of cover spot.

Dig: Jonathan Van Meter, who penned the Kate Upton profile for Vogue's April edition and lost the coveted cover spot to Kim Kardashian and Kanye West (pictured), took to his Facebook page to vent his frustrations 

The review, written for Magazine Review's blog, states: 'While the article that goes with the [Kardashian West] cover story is entertaining, the jewel of this [issue] is undoubtedly ‘Follow Me’ by Jonathan Van Meter, photographed by Mario Testino.'

Mr Van Meter, who has previously profiled giants including Oprah Winfrey, Gwen Stefani and Lady Gaga for Vogue, concluded frankly with: 'So there.' He later removed the post and deleted his Facebook account this morning.

And the Kardashian West cover didn't only come as a surprise to Mr Van Meter; it stunned legions of avid Vogue readers too, many of whom took to the publication's website to vent their disapproval.

'I have 
always purchased Vogue, ever since I was a teenager and I felt like I 
could always rely on Vogue to inspire me and educate on a number of 
levels,' wrote one woman.

Ditched: Mr Van Meter's story on supermodel Kate Upton (pictured in Los Angeles last week) ran alongside a photo spread shot by Mario Testino which was originally reserved for the cover

'I don’t buy tabloids for a reason because I don’t look up to or find inspiration in people with no talent and even less morals. Wow, RIP Vogue. The last bastion of style has fallen today. I’ll miss you.'

But Anna Wintour, the magazine's editor-in-chief, defended her choice and also put an end to rumors that West had been 'begging' her to put Kardashian on the cover of Vogue.

She wrote in her Editor's Letter: 'You may have read that Kanye begged me to put his fiancée on Vogue’s cover. He did nothing of the sort. The gossip might make better reading, but the simple fact of the matter is that it isn’t true.'

Mr Van Meter's profile on 21-year-old supermodel Kate Upton, which lost the cover story battle, came with an array of tastefully shot photos of the blonde with the famous curves in a series of slim fitting gowns.

Meter's (right) thinly veiled opinion that his Kate Upton story should 
have taken the cover spot

In it, Ms Upton, who launched into fame thanks to her buxom 2013 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition cover - explains that while she 'likes being sexy', she is cautious in how she portrays herself to the world.

'I definitely have limits,' she says.'There's a line between becoming, you know, a little cheap and cheesy versus being sexy. And I try to be very careful of that line.'

As for Ms Wintour's shock decision to idolize the Kardashian West couple on her cover, it seems her choice is actually proving to be a wise one, as the issue is flying off newsstands.

According to the New York Post, the controversial April issue is set to sell around 400,000 copies.

Comparatively, Beyonce's cover sold more than 355,000 copies and Michelle Obama's cover sold nearly 300,000.
