When you get yourself stuck between a rock and a hard place, it can be a slippery slope.

Fortunately, for this raccoon, this was exactly what got it out.

The unfortunate mammal was found with its head trapped in a storm grate in Framingham, Massachusetts last week.

Stuck: The raccoon was discovered with its head trapped in the metal grating in Framingham, Massachusetts

When Stormwater Supervisor Brooks McCarty and Animal Control Officer Kathy MacKenzie arrived at the scene they came up with the idea of using dish soap to get it out. 

'We soaped his head up and pulled and pulled and twisted,' McCarty told MetroWest Daily News.

'All of a sudden he just popped out and she let him go and he stood there confused and then just ran up into a tree.'

Not the first time: Another racoon pictured last summer after getting its head stuck  in a sewer drain in downtown Detroit
