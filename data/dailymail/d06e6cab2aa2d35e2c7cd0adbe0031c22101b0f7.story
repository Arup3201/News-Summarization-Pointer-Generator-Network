Lillo Brancato, who played a mobster in HBO's The Sopranos, has landed his first Hollywood movie role following his eight-year prison stint for his part in the murder of a cop.

The 38-year-old has started working on the film 'Back in the Day', which tells the story of a Brooklyn boxer taken in by a mobster, the New York Post first reported.

In the movie, which stars Alec Baldwin, Danny Glover and Mike Tyson, Brancato plays the cousin of one of the boxer's opponents and gets into a scuffle with the lead character.

The role comes more than a year after he was released from prison. He served eight years for a botched robbery in the Bronx in which an off-duty police officer was shot dead.

In December 2005, Brancato tried to break into an apartment with Steven Armento, a low-level mobster and the father of his girlfriend, to steal Valium but NYPD officer Daniel Enchautegui heard glass break as they entered the building and confronted them.

While Enchautegui waited for backup, a gun battle erupted and he was fatally shot in the chest.

Armento was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison.

Brancato was found not guilty of murder but was convicted of robbery and sentenced to nine years in prison minus time served. He was released on December 31, 2013.

After leaving prison, he was given his second chance by William DeMeo, who wrote 'Back in the Day', and is also producing and starring in the movie.

'I know a lot of people were nervous about hiring someone who had a tainted past,' DeMeo told the Post. 'I could tell deep down in my heart that he changed. I wanted to give him a second chance.'

Brancato, who has been sharing behind-the-scene snaps on his Instagram page, first met DeMeo while they were both going for a role in the 2001 film, 'Boss of Bosses', which DeMeo ultimately secured.

DeMeo said that he called a friend in the NYPD to ask him whether he would be offended if he hired the ex-con, but the friend said it was no problem.

But the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association in New York, J. Lynch, told TMZ that he would not be so forgiving.

'We ask all right-thinking people not to support this thug’s acting career by avoiding this movie and any project in which he is involved,' he said. 

As for Brancato, the actor said he's particularly excited about working with Mike Tyson, saying: 'He's had such an interesting life. He also was incarcerated, so a lot of things are similar.'

The actor is best known for his role in the 1993 movie 'A Bronx Tale, starring Robert De Niro, and for playing Matthew Bevilaqua in The Sopranos.

After his release, he also appeared in the small independent movie, 'Monsters of Mulberry Street', in which he played a priest. 

'I said I don't think it would be a wise decision for me right now to play anything of violence, I don't think it sends the right message,' he told This is 50 as he explained his decision to take the job.

He has also expressed his remorse about his role in the 2005 killing.

'I wish I could just take it back and I could bring police officer Daniel back to life,' Brancato told ET after he left prison. 'He was a hero. He was off-duty, lived next door, heard broken glass, came out and put his life on the line.'

And last month, he shared his mug shot to Instragram, calling it 'a time in my life when things weren't going too well'.

'I took a lot from a negative experience and have grown in a positive way as a result of it #learnedmylesson,' he wrote.
