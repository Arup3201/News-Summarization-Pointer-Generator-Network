Ghazala Khan, 37, former vice-principal at a Muslim girls' college, was sacked after 'opposing rules'

The vice principal of a Muslim girls' college who claimed she was sacked for opposing rules telling all pupils to wear veils during lessons has lost her claim for racial discrimination. 

Ghazala Khan, 37, alleged she was told she would 'go to hell' and branded a 'stupid outsider' by her boss and barred from certain assemblies at Mohiuddin International Girls College in Burnley, Lancashire.

She lost her job in 2012 claiming it was because she questioned why some teachers refused to teach girls unless they wore veils across their faces.  

But today an employment tribunal in Manchester dismissed her claims and ruled in favour of the college. 

The college denied she was vice-principal and said she left the establishment after it was criticised during an inspection. It said staff had received complaints describing Mrs Khan as 'rude and bad-tempered'.

The school which charges £5,500 a year for international students and £4,500 for UK and European pupils, was described as a 'Muslim Eton' for girls when plans were originally put forward in 2009. 

Founded in October 2010 the school has around 90 students and is run by the Birmingham-based Mohuiddin Trust under the leadership of Sheikh Hazrat Pir Alaudin Siddiqui Sahib - an Islamic scholar based in Pakistan.

Mrs Khan was appointed as vice principal in 2011 but she said she clashed with the college principal  after saying she and some students had some Islamic teachings they disagreed with forced upon them.

She said one fellow teacher refused to speak to her, as she did not wear a veil, and she had challenged the same tutor after he ordered all his female students to wear the niqab in his lessons.

Mrs Khan also said the college principal have warned of the school being 'polluted' because she had 'let a Christian in'. 

Mrs Khan claims she was immediately dismissed after a 'heated' debate with the school's principal Amjad Bashir (left) and Zahir Ahmed (right), a director of the Mohiuddin Trust which runs the college

Mohiuddin International Girls College, which opened its doors in October 2010, describes itself as a 'unique and friendly institution'.

It was set up by the Mohiuddin Trust - a charity which aims to help those who are poor or under-privileged - under the leadership of Sheikh Hazrat Pir Alaudin Siddiqui Sahib, an Islamic scholar based in Pakistan. 

When plans for the college for girls over 16, it described itself as the 'Muslim Eton'.

It said it's aim is to 'educate and empower women regardless of their age, colour, creed or social stature.'

The trust acquired the former Burnley College in Lancashire and charges £5,500 a year for international students and £4,500 for UK and European enrolments.

Staff teach A Levels and GCSEs in subjects including English, Mathematics and Science as well as Urdu and Arabic.

The 90 or so students also have the opportunity to take on an Aalimah course - or Islamic Theology. It offers study of Arabic grammar, etymology, syntax and law.

There is also halls of residence accommodation facilities for overseas students.

The private-run establishment asks for donations on a section of its website.

Speaking about the teacher's conduct, she said: 'There were quite a few times I didn't agree with the way he would make children wear veils across their faces just so he could teach them.

'I said "nowhere in Islam does it say they must wear a veil to come to classes." He said, "you have no knowledge of anything and have no right to talk with somebody not related to you." They said it was necessary to make all girls wear the veil.'

Mrs Khan said she was also banned from assemblies where the girls would gather each evening because she was 'an outsider' and would have to wait outside. 

She added: 'There were a few occasions when I wasn't allowed into the assembly because they said I was an outsider.

'But when recitation is going on I am a Muslim and I recite the Qur'an. Mr Bashir made me wait outside. He used to say, "can you wait outside? There are a few things you wouldn't understand. When we have finished you can come in." I used to say, "it's all blessings, why can't I come in?"'

She claimed she was also not respected because she was female and not considered a Muslim 'scholar', despite being an experienced teacher.

Mrs Khan said: 'The only way that we differ is that they say the Sheik, the founder of the college, is going to take them to heaven and everyone who does not believe in him is going to hell.'

Mrs Khan said matters came to a head after an Ofsted-type school inspection for Muslim education called the British School Inspectorate, where the college was criticised in a number of areas.

The hearing was told that a meeting was called with the principal and trust director and she was 'blamed' for their failed inspection, called a 'stupid outsider' and ordered to leave. 

She said: 'I was upset, wasn't feeling well, had a lot of stress related issues and didn't want to come to court.

'For two years I waited and thought "maybe they might sort things out for me" but they didn't. I was very stressed. I was going through a lot, I had just lost my job. 

'I was very depressed. My doctor said I was maybe going to have a nervous breakdown. 

'I had realised I had been wronged. I thought they had been very prejudiced towards me and I thought I had been wronged.'

Mrs Khan - who was representing herself - put questions to 45-year old Mr Bashir, a civil engineer who reacted angrily and was warned by tribunal judge over his conduct. 

When it was put to him by Mrs Khan that she had actually employed a Christian teacher, he replied: 'You don't even have a degree. You're not even qualified. I'm 100 per cent absolutely sure she was not employed as a vice-principal.'

The tribunal, at Alexandra House in Manchester, heard that Mrs Khan claims she was ostracised by staff 

Later Mr Bashir's own lawyer Amy Smith asked him: 'You are being accused of telling the business teacher that the claimant was incompetent in her work and she was a stupid outsider.'

He replied: 'I never used the words stupid outsider.'

She added: 'You are accused of making rude jokes because she was an outsider and she was going to hell and if you had it your way you would employ her as a cleaner or tea lady.' 

Mr Bashir who is no longer principal at the college replied: 'I never said that.'

Miss Smith also put it to him that he told students Mrs Khan wouldn't understand them because she wasn't 'among them', which he also denied.

He said the school employed Christian teachers so could not be accused of religious prejudice.
