Inside Edition correspondent Megan Alexander has opened up about her decision to save her virginity for marriage,

Ms Alexander, 34, who has been married to husband Brian Cournoyer since 2008, has told Fox News that her decision to wait stemmed from her devotion to her Christian faith.

‘I claimed my faith for myself in about junior high,’ she said, adding: ‘I accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and saviour in about 7th grade and made that decision myself and that’s been the best thing I’ve ever did.’ [sic]

The Seattle native says that she wanted to speak out about her decision to wait ‘because I feel like young people today, specifically teenagers and millennials in their 20s and 30s, there’s so much pressure to just get involved [physically] and to think that’s normal. 

‘I wanted people to know, hey there’s another option. This is the option that I chose and it can work for you too.’

Ms Alexander admits that she is well aware her choice of lifestyle is not for everyone.

However, she hopes that speaking out will help influence those who feel pressured to have sex.

‘I want to encourage the next generation to take their time, to value their bodies and to realize that it's okay to wait if you want to.

‘And for me, it worked out great and I believe that other people need to hear that message and know that it's just fine to take their time,’ she said.

Ms Alexander says that her husband, 34, with whom she has one son, was completely comfortable with her decision to wait.

‘Because we were friends before and [he] knew what I stood for, what I was all about, what I believed in and I did of him,' she said.
