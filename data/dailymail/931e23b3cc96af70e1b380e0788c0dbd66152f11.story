Fresh potatoes have suffered a slump in popularity - because people prefer rice.

Sales fell by more than eight per cent over the past year – and they are now facing a 'fight for relevance' in Britain, according to the Potato Council.

The disappointing performance mirrors the overall decline in sales of fruit and vegetables across the country, with Britons buying 130,000 tonnes less of fruit and veg in 2013.

Caroline Evans, of the Potato Council, blamed the poor sales of spuds on the national drive to reduce food waste and the growing popularity of curry and fajitas.

She told the Grocer magazine: 'It's good that people are not actively rejecting the category. People still like potatoes, but the challenge is that we need different approaches for the whole supply chain.

'Shoppers need distractions and better signposting. A lot of shoppers make an emotional connection when they see a potato in its prepared form, rather than as a raw vegetable.'

As well as switching to other staples, shoppers are also opting for smaller retail packs and salad potatoes.

Data from Kantar Worldpanel revealed the volume of fresh potatoes sold had fallen by eight per cent over the year to May. Despite seeing a recovery in 2013, sales of fresh organic potatoes declined again and in the last quarter reached their lowest volume recorded since 2010.

Fresh spuds account for £1.4billion of annual potato sales, which are worth £2.3billion a year.

Earlier this month, potato growers in Jersey were reportedly struggling to shift a bumper crop of spuds.

A combination of rain, sun and mild temperatures created perfect growing conditions - but many were too large as a result.

It was claimed Supermarkets were refusing to buy the potatoes - which were twice as big as the ideal size between 2.5cm to 5cm - leaving farmers having to either give tons of cast-offs to charity or leave them rotting in the fields.
