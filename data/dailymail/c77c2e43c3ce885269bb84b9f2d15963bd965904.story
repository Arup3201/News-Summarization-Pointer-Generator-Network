With Christmas just around the corner, Munchkin the Shih Tzu has got into the festive spirit and gone sledding.

The 8lb dog, who has found internet fame wearing a comical teddy bear suit, took to the slopes in San Bernadino near Los Angeles, California.

Kitted out in Christmas attire, Munchkin is seen sledding down the slopes in a small wooden sleigh.

With Christmas just around the corner, Munchkin the Shih Tzu has got into the festive spirit and gone sledding

But although her tongue is out in her previous videos - including a spin on a treadmill -  in this clip she does not seem too enthused by the festive fun.

She looks straight ahead as she travels down the snow and then stares into the camera when it stops. 

She then looks to the side in a unimpressed fashion as if to say, 'Get me out of this thing!'

Munchkin belongs to Cindy Roth from California. 

Roth crafted the fluffy ensemble for her tiny 14-inch-tall puppy out of a plush toy. 

To make the costume, Roth measured Munchkin and selected an appropriately sized toy.

She also picked a teddy with matching sandy-colored fur. 

She then cut the face, feet and back out of the soft bear and removed all of the stuffing except for the arms.

To finish, Roth inserted Munchkin's front arms into the teddy's legs.

Munchkin appears to have a penchant for dressing up and another photo shows her modeling a party hat, complete with pink feather trim.

Her novel antics have secured her a burgeoning fan base and her YouTube channel boasts more than three million hits.
