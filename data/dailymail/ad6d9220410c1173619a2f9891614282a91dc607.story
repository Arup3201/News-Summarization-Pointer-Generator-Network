Sebastian Vettel will 'get p****d tonight' to celebrate his victory at the Malaysian Grand Prix.

The 27-year-old German produced a stunning performance to win in his Ferrari ahead of Mercedes pair Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg at the Sepang International Circuit.

The four-time world champion was visibly emotional on the podium after enduring a torrid 2014 season, his final year with Red Bull before switching to Ferrari over the winter.

During his podium interview with Eddie Jordan, Vettel said: 'It's been a while I've not been on the top step, and my first time with Scuderia Ferrari. There was a big change over the winter, and the welcome the team gave me when I arrived was fantastic.

'I've only done two races, but I'm so proud of today. We beat them (Mercedes) fair and square, I guess that's why it's a bit emotional. This is a great achievement and we have a great car.

'Today was a very, very special day, and will remain a part of me. Thank you to the team - grazie Italia. I want to celebrate today and get p****d tonight.'

Vettel left Red Bull over the winter to join Ferrari, a move he described as a dream come trune

Vettel's victory at Sepang came in just his second race since joining the sport's most iconic team, a move he described as a dream come true.

The German added; 'I remember when the gate opened at Maranello, it was like a dream coming true. I remember the last time I was there I was a kid watching Michael Schumacher over the fence. Now I’m driving that very red car - it’s incredible.'

It was Ferrari's first victory since Fernando Alonso won the 2013 Spanish Grand Prix and Vettel's first victory since Brazil at the end of the same season.

Ferrari's pace in Malaysia was also proven by Kimi Raikkonen, who finished in fourth place despite starting from 11th on the grid and an early puncture that forced him into an extra pit stop.

Speaking on Sky Sports, Raikkonen said: 'We had a very poor weekend in the sense of things going wrong. After the puncture I got a little bit of damage to the floor and I think we did the maximum we could.

'It is good for the team and good for Sebastian and after where we were last year it is a good job the team has done.'
