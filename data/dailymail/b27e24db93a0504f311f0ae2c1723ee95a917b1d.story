There was a public outcry when it was revealed that the next iPhone would get a new docking port connector.

The newer, slimline port means that thousands of current Apple accessories will need a potentially clunky adapter to work with the 'iPhone 5' - or become unusable.

Now, latest leaks from the website iMore, which has strong sources 'close to Apple', suggest that the entire next generation of iDevices, including the iPod Nano, iPod Touch, iPad Mini and future versions of the iPad, will use the new port.

Apple is expected to refresh its iPod and iPhone product line this Autumn, and if the company sticks to its usual policy of annual upgrades, a new iPad can be expected next Spring.

Change: This picture is believed to show a prototype case for the new iPhone, with its new connector design which is set to make every existing accessory completely obsolete

Old and new: The current iPhone is shown with the prototype of the iPhone 5's outer casing

iMore
is consistently accurate with predictions about Apple's next moves, and
suggest the announcement will be made at a launch event in San 
Francisco on Wednesday, September 12.

The
site believes a special connector will be released to connect older 
accessories - such as docking stations and speakers - to newer versions 
of the range.

Many fans were
left angry after images allegedly showing the iPhone 5's new design 
leaked out, showing the traditional 30-pin dock connector - used for 
charging, syncing files and pumping audio to hi-fis - had been 
re-designed into a smaller shape.

Useless: The $850 Bang & Olufsen BeoSound 8 is designed to work with the current iPhone's design

The new port looks similar to micro 
USB, the standard supported by all other phone manufacturers - however 
it is very unlikely that Apple will support this standard, despite moves
by the EU to get all phone companies to rally around one type of cable.

Apple's version has a triangle-shaped wedge at one end, which should stop users plugging in the cable the wrong way round.

Mac
fans may spot a superficial similarity to a Firewire port, which is 
used to transfer raw video footage and larger files at high speed.

Obsolete: The B&W Zeppelin speaker, left, and the Bose Sounddock 10, right, are other pricey gadgets which will have to be upgraded before they will work with the iPhone 5

The new port means older accessories will be rendered redundant unless adapters 
are released to make them compatible again - which is likely to be an 
ungainly solution, and may be impossible for some docks.

The
'nano-SIM' slot, containing the SIM card which connects a phone to the 
carrier network, has also been redesigned to be thinner, although this 
will be unlikely to cause much disruption to users as networks will 
provide replacements SIMs if necessary.

There
are also rumours, reported on iMore, that the iPad 3, which was 
released in the Spring, will get a slight tweak this Autumn to brink the
dock connector in-line with the rest of the range.
