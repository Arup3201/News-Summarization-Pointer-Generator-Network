Samsung has revealed two gold limited edition handsets hot on the heels of Apple, after consumers went crazy for its golden iPhone 5S handset last week.

The tech giant unveiled two limited edition Galaxy S4 smartphones in gold and pink, and gold and brown colour combinations, but they will currently only be available for customers in the Gulf region.

While rumours of a golden iPhone were mounting some time before the launch of Apple's latest high-end smartphone a fortnight ago, demand for the gold version of the iPhone 5S handset was reportedly higher than the firm expected.

While it would be impossible for Samsung to copy Apple's lucrative golden move in just two weeks, TechCrunch believes Samsung probably had its ear close to the Apple rumour mill to capitalise on the probable demand of gold handsets.

So far it appears that the Samsung handset will only be available in the United Arab Emirates market, where Nokia has previously launched a gold smartphone.

A scarcity of the gold-colored iPhone 5S models drove ebay auction prices for the coveted items into the five figures.

On Monday this week, a single, unopened and unlocked 16GB gold Apple iPhone, which retails for around $200 in the U.S. on contract, sold for $10,100 (£6,295) following a brief but bitter bidding war on the auction website.

Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, said: 'This is our best iPhone launch yet - more than nine million new iPhones sold―a new record for first weekend sales.'

'The demand for the new iPhones has been incredible and while we’ve sold out of our initial supply of iPhone 5s, stores continue to receive new iPhone shipments regularly.'

But according to Forbes, unless you ordered your gold iPhone in the first hour it became available Friday, it won’t be shipping until October.

Apple also took a gamble on demand for novel coloured smartphone with the launch of its iPhone 5C handsets.

Much like the unexpected demand of the gold iPhone 5S handset, the pink version of the cheaper handset has been a big success.

Sales figures show Apple's gamble with colourful iPhones is paying off, with the pink model accounting for 46 per cent of sales - almost more than all the other colours combined

Reports from iPhoneStockChecker.co.uk found that the blue model is the second most-popular device, accounting for 32 per cent of 5C sales.

In third place is green, at 12 per cent, followed by white at 9 per cent and yellow brings up the rear, accounting for just 1 per cent of sales.

Apple could be looking to take this strategy into the iPad part of the business. Experts have already said there could be at least two new iPads released as soon as next month.
