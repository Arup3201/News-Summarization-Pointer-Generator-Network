A former rent boy has claimed that he was blackmailed into having sex with senior Conservatives in the 1970s - including late MP Charles Irving

A former rent boy has claimed that he was blackmailed into having sex with senior Conservatives in the 1970s.

The man said he was threatened by two 'pimps' when he arrived in London from Northern Ireland - who told him they would send compromising pictures of him back to his parents if he tried to escape.

He also claims they threatened that an 'accident' might befall his parents if he refused to have sex with their clients.

The man - who is now 59 and is identified only as David - told the Sunday Mirror he was plied with alcohol by MP Charles Irving.

He said we was then forced to have sex with the Tory in exchange for £30.

He also claims that he had to perform a sex act on a Lord while he was driving around London, and that he was given a fountain pen in return.

He decided to come forward after reports surfaced of the Tory activist who supplied boys to ministers in Margaret Thatcher’s government.

David, now a married father-of-four, said that he also attended parties where Conservatives celebrated their first year as MPs by having sex with boys as young as 12.

He claims his descent into prostitution began shortly after he arrived in London in 1975, after he left Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles.

David claims he was picked up by a man in his 20s called Kevin who introduced him to another man called Alan.

He said he was raped twice after an evening of drinking and was later told that graphic images had been taken of him. He said he was then blackmailed into prostitution.

David claims he had sex with Charles Irving, then Tory MP for Cheltenham, who died in 1995, at a country house in Essex, and was later taken to parties with senior Conservatives, where he was forced to perform sex acts. 

He is now considering giving a statement to the Government inquiry into alleged abuse at the heart of Westminster, announced by Theresa May

He said: 'One night I was taken near the House of Lords and picked up by a peer. We were driven around London while I performed a sex act on him. He gave me a fountain pen.'

He said at one party he saw a boy of around 12 being taken into a room.

He said: 'I assumed he’d just been "delivered". He looked at me. I saw fear in his eyes. That look will always haunt me.'

His health later suffered so much that his 'pimps' allowed him to go home.

He is now considering giving a statement to the Government inquiry into alleged abuse at the heart of Westminster.
