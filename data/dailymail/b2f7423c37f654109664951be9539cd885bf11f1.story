Around £150million a year is to be ploughed into primary schools to boost sports provision and help develop the Olympics stars of the future, David Cameron said yesterday.

The move follows criticism that the Coalition was neglecting school sports by imposing cuts.

Just after the 2010 election, Education Secretary Michael Gove provoked an outcry by abolishing £162million of ring-fenced funding for the national School Sport Partnerships.

Investing in the future: Ministers are set to announce up to £150 million of extra funding to help primary schools improve their sports

Now Mr Cameron has vowed to get sport 
for children back on track. Every school will receive a lump sum 
proportionate to the number of pupils. A primary school with 250 pupils 
would receive £9,250 per year.

This is the equivalent of around two 
days a week of a primary teacher or a coach’s time – enough to make sure
 every pupil in the school can do sport with a specialist. The funding 
will be ‘ring-fenced’, meaning it can only to be spent on sport.

Heads will decide what is best for 
their children’s needs, from specialist coaching and teacher training to
 after-school or weekend events.

The Prime Minister said: ‘The Olympic 
and Paralympic Games marked an incredible year for this country and I 
will always be proud that we showed the world what Britain can do.

‘I want to ensure the Games count for 
the future too and that means capitalising on the inspiration young 
people took from what they saw during those summer months.

Keeping the legacy alive: The move comes after calls for more investment in school sports to help build upon the legacy of the 2012 London Olympics and Paralympics

‘With this new approach to sport, we 
can create a culture in our schools that encourages all children to be 
active and enjoy sport, and helps foster the aspirations of future 
Olympians and Paralympians.

‘Whether that is the future Jessica 
Ennis, Ellie Simmonds or Mo Farah, or someone who will simply learn to 
love sport and exercise for a lifetime, this investment will benefit a 
whole generation of children for many years to come.’

Other changes include tougher 
assessment of sport provision via Ofsted to ensure the funding is 
bringing the maximum benefit for all pupils, with schools held to 
account for how they spend the money.

And teacher training will be overhauled to produce a cadre of primary teachers with a particular specialism in PE.

This is being developed in conjunction
 with sporting bodies and will start with a pilot covering 120 primary 
teachers, with the first of these beginning work in schools in September
 2013.

The announcement was welcomed by sports and education groups, and leading figures in the world of sport.

The Prime Minister’s Olympic and 
Paralympic Legacy Ambassador Lord Coe, who organised the successful 
London 2012 Games, said: ‘When I stood up in Singapore in 2005 I spoke 
of London’s vision to connect young people with the inspirational power 
of the Games so they are inspired to choose sport.

‘Today’s announcement does just that 
and by focussing on primary schools we have the opportunity to use sport
 and physical activity to shape the daily lives of young people. I am 
particularly pleased with the proposals around initial teacher training 
and continual professional development because I know from my own 
experience what an impact teachers and their engagement can have on the 
lives of young people.’

Mo Farah, who one two golds at the 
London Olympics, said: ‘It is great to see a commitment to funding 
school sport and that it is something I passionately believe in.

‘I am very excited to know that lots 
of children will be able to get involved in sport while at school and 
get more help from teachers and coaches. It really is very important.’

Jess Ennis, another Olympic gold 
medallist, said: ‘It is great to see initiatives that help to give 
really young children the chance to take part in sport.

‘This latest funding for primary 
schools sounds fantastic – so many of them have no funds for PE and 
hopefully now whether in an inner city or small rural community young 
kids will be introduced to fun ways to be active that will spark an 
interest in taking part in sport as they grow up.’
