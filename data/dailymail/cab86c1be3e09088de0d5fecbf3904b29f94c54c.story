Gallstones patient Mark Hemmings (pictured) made a desperate 999 call for an ambulance - but his request was refused, an inquest heard.

A 999 call handler advised a gallstones patient to call back if he fell unconscious as she refused to send him an ambulance - days before he died in agony, an inquest heard.

Mark Hemmings died just 30 minutes after he eventually arrived at hospital - three days after he first called for an ambulance from his home in Meir, Stoke-on-Trent.

The 41-year-old had been struck with the painful gallstones - which could have been cured with a routine operation.

But despite his increasingly desperate pleas on March 29 last year, Good Friday, his requests for an ambulance were refused by a 999 call handler before his case was referred to an out-of-hours GP.

An inquest in to his death heard harrowing recordings of Mr Hemmings' phone conversations with both the 999 call handler and the GP urgent care unit.

During a seven-and-a-half minute call, Mr Hemmings begs the 999 operator three times to send an ambulance - but is refused each time.

At one stage the dispatcher told him to call back if he fell unconscious or his condition deteriorated and advised him to take a warm bath.

Mr Hemmings can be heard asking whether he needs to go to hospital, before operator Heidi Nicholls says: 'No, you need to stay on the phone for a moment. 

'You could try a warm bath, hot water bottle in the painful area but if you collapse, become unconscious, unresponsive, faint, or become pale, cold or clammy it's 999.'  

Earlier in the conversation, she said: 'From what you've told me you don't require an emergency ambulance but we will get somebody to call you back.'

Mr Hemmings replied: 'Can't I have an ambulance - I'm in agony.' 

Mr Hemming received no medical treatment over the Easter weekend until his carer eventually found him in agony on the floor of his home on April 1, and raised the alarm.

On this occasion, an ambulance did attend and took Mr Hemmings to University Hospital of North Staffordshire where he was diagnosed with pancreatitis.

But minutes after he arrived Mr Hemmings died. A post mortem revealed his gallstones had blocked his pancreatic duct and triggered a fatal heart attack.

An inquest heard Mr Hemmings was unable to drive and spent his final two days in agony as his organs slowly failed. 

During the hearing at North Staffordshire Coroner's Court a specialist from the University Hospital of North Staffordshire said that if he had been taken to hospital sooner he would probably have survived.

Consultant Damien Durkin criticised a series of computerised questions used by ambulance controllers to decide if callers need help and out-of-hours doctors who failed to 'ring alarm bells'.

He said: 'Six out of 10 people in intensive care with severe pain from this condition come through it - and it is nine out of 10 for those with less severe pain.

'The algorithm failed to benefit Mark. 

'It is biased towards heart problems and less towards abdominal pain.'

Paramedics eventually arrived at his home but Mr Hemming went into cardiac arrest.

Despite working to restart his heart throughout the six mile journey to hospital he was pronounced dead minutes after arriving. 

Call handler Miss Nicholls said the questions she was told to ask Mr Hemmings by a computerised algorithm system ruled he did not need an emergency ambulance.

She added: 'We cannot override this and although there are paramedics in the control room for us to ask, I would not think the system would come up with the wrong answer.'

After his first call Mr Hemmings was advised to take a warm bath to ease the pain and the case was passed on to an out-of-hours GP, the inquest heard.

He waited 90-minutes before Dr Sri Sukhavasi called him back, and told the medic he was in excruciating pain and about to pass out.

But during the three-and-a-half minute conversation, the doctor refused to attend his home and instead told Mr Hemmings - who lived alone and could not drive - to come to the surgery himself.

The inquest heard a harrowing recording of Mr Hemmings' call to West Midlands Ambulance Service which took place at 11.09pm on Friday, March 29 last year.

He starts off the call by asking for an ambulance before giving his address.

Mr Hemmings: 'My stomach's in agony, duck, I've got lumps in my stomach, I'm in agony duck.'

Miss Nicholls: 'Ok have you got any other symptoms.'

Mr Hemmings: 'No duck, just seating a lot. Weak, really weak.'

Miss Nicholls: 'How long has this been going on for?'

Mr Hemmings: 'Mostly all day duck, a few hours.'

Miss Nicholls: 'OK, put your hand on your tummy or your chest and tell me if it feels a normal temperature. If it feels warm?

'Have you had any diarrhoea or vomiting?'

Mr Hemmings: 'Yeah, I've been sick a few times.'

Miss Nicholls: 'Have you had diarrhoea?'

Mr Hemmings: 'No.'

Miss Nicholls: 'Have you brought up any blood?'

Mr Hemmings: 'No. I've got gallstones in my stomach duck.'

Miss Nicholls: 'Have you got any crushing or severe aching pain in your chest, upper back or upper abdomen?'

Mr Hemmings: 'No duck, I've got just pain in my stomach.'

Miss Nicholls: 'Is it below your belly button or above your belly button?'

Mr Hemmings: 'Above.'

Miss Nicholls: 'Have you got any crushing or severe aching pain in your uper abdomen?'

Mr Hemmings: 'Sort of yeah.'

Miss Nicholls: 'What do you mean by sort of when you say "sort of"?'

(Inaudible)

Miss Nicholls: 'Is it a stabbing pain rather than a crushing or severe aching?'

Mr Hemmings: 'More like stabbing pain. Can I have an ambulance?'

Miss Nicholls: 'Have you passed a bowel motion that looks black and tarry or red or maroon.'

Mr Hemmings: 'No.'

Miss Nicholls: 'And have you suddenly become confused or more confused than usual?'

(inaudible)

You're going dizzy and that yeah?

Mr Hemmings: 'Yeah.'

Miss Nicholls: 'Now Mark, from what you've told me, you don't require an emergency ambulance bit what we are going to do is we're going to get somebody to call you back, ok?'

Mr Hemmings: 'Can I have an ambulance?'

Miss Nicholls: 'From the answers you don't need an ambulance ok?'

Mr Hemmings: 'I'm in agony duck.'

Miss Nicholls: 'OK, I appreciate that, but from the answers you give me you don't require an ambulance. What you do need to do is to speak to the local GP within the next two hours ok?'

Mr Hemmings: 'Do I need to go to the hospital?'

Miss Nicholls: 'No, you need to stay on the phone for a moment ok. Paracetemol can help with your tummy pain, follow the instructions on the pack, any doubt ask the pharmacist. Don't use ibuprofen or any anti-inflammatory such as aspirin as these can make your stomach worse. 

'Stomach ache is very common, not often serious and gets better on its own, but you can try a warm bath, hot water bottle on the painful area - but if you collapse, become unconscious, unresponsive, faint or become pale, cold or clammy, it's 999.' 

When Mr Hemmings, who suffered mental and physical problems, failed to turn up for the appointment his records were marked 'did not attend' and no further checks were made on his condition.

The inquest heard the tragedy happened over the same weekend the GP out-of-hours service was passed from North Staffordshire Urgent Care (NSUC) to a new provider based in the north of England.

Dr Sukhavasi told the hearing: 'I had no doubt he needed to be seen straight away but I thought it would be more effective for him to come in to the base.

'I did not offer to visit because we had an enormous amount of work that night and it is better to examine patients in a clinical setting than people's homes.

'I did not call an ambulance because I knew he had already been told one was not necessary.

'In hindsight when he said he was in pain I should have explored further what was causing it.'

The inquest heard he was left in agony over the weekend and was not found until his carer Yasir Mohammed found him passed out on the floor of his home on the Monday morning.

Mr Mohammed, from the Brighter Futures mental health charity, dialled 999 again and this time a response car and ambulance were sent. 

West Midlands Ambulance Trust medical director Dr Andrew Carson said six of Britain's 11 services had the algorithm system which had been used on millions of people.

He said: 'Its conclusion to have the case assessed by a GP within two hours was correct and we trust that the other organisation will deal with it.'

Reserving his verdict until November 14, Coroner for Stoke-on-Trent and North Staffordshire Ian Smith said: 'He fell through gaps in the system because he was not pushy enough.'
