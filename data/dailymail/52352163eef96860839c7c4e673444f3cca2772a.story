Jayesh Raut filmed his suicide on his mobile phone and recorded a 44-minute video in which he blamed his wife Trupti's affair for his death

A woman and her lover have been arrested in India after her husband hanged himself and blamed her affair for his death in a 44-minute video suicide note.

Trupti Raut, 23, and Rajesh Verma, 38, now face charges of abetting the suicide of Mumbai businessman Jayesh Raut.

The 29-year-old hanged himself at his apartment in Sion and recorded his death on his phone.

He texted his wife to tell her to watch the clip and then hanged himself.

She immediately texted his family to get to go round to the apartment but he was found dead by his mother and brother. 

In his video note, Mr Raut said he was depressed about his wife's affair despite him pleading with her to end it.

Mrs Raut and Mr Verma were arrested on Saturday.

Mr Raut's mother, Latna, told the Times of India that her daughter-in-law had left her husband four months ago for Mr Verma and then became pregnant.

She said: 'Jayesh tried to counsel her, but in vain.

'She left Jayesh's house and did not come back for four months.'

She said her son had previously tried to stop his wife leaving by slitting his wrists.

The couple married in February following a nine-year courtship.

Police told the newspaper, Mr Raut had previously contacted officers to accuse his wife and her lover of 'mentall harassing him'.

Under The Indian Penal Code of 1860, anyone who is deemed to have driven someone to commit suicide faces up to ten years in jail and a fine.

In September, the Indian Supreme Court ruled it was illegal for a husband to have an affair if it drove his wife to suicide.
