A pair of impoverished students posed as millionaires in order to be given a tour of a £5million penthouse by an estate agent - and then cheekily offered £800 for a 'quick sale'. 

Students Ben Foreman and Will Bainbridge, both aged 19, pretended to be millionaires so they could view the luxury 17th storey penthouse flat in Aldgate, London, which features a roof terrace and two kitchens.

The University College London students, from Camden, north west London, dressed up in their best suits and said the estate agent did not catch on - even whenl they proposed a 'quick sale' offer of £800 on the multi-million pound flat.

Second year philosophy student Ben wrote about their experience in student newspaper The Tab: 'Living in London we see all these massive places and we saw an advert for this one and thought it looked awesome.

'So we posed as London's latest millionaires in order to view the finest apartment the capital has to offer.

Ben told the estate agent that he works in London's exclusive Savile Row and second year economics student Will posed as a high-flying banker. 

They wrote: 'The estate agent showed us architectural plans for the completed development as we marvelled at the power of human ingenuity.

'Then we maintained a polite silence as we whooshed up in the lift to the 17th floor.'

The pair were taken on a tour of the three-bedroom penthouse which boasts a games room, four bathrooms and two living rooms.

Ben wrote: 'Looking around, it was clearly a decent gaff, and probably worth its eye-watering rent.

'Despite forcefully voicing our concerns that the view was limited to only 360°, the estate agent assured us that on a good day we’d have a great view of some prime London real estate

'The bed was comfortable and the bath was more than spacious enough for both of us at once.

'We went in with an offer of £800, which is the sum of our overdrafts combined. It was declined.'

The pair wondered if they had the money whether they would buy the penthouse anyway.

Will said: 'It was the dream, but we questioned whether our money could be better spent elsewhere.'

Ben told MailOnline: ‘I’ve Just started writing for The Tab. We recently went on a bar crawl in Bishopsgate and thought imagine if you lived here, and that’s where the idea came from really.

‘The man who showed us around was really nice. The developers have a station where the concierge will eventually be and he took us straight up and was very professional the whole way through.

‘He didn’t look like he twigged we were just students – but he may have just had a really good poker face.

‘I told him I worked on Savile Row which isn’t technically a lie as I do have a Saturday job in Abercrombie.

‘We mentioned the £800 in passing but I think he thought we were joking – he didn’t seem to take it seriously.

‘Seeing the penthouse has definitely given us more motivation to do well now.

‘I’ve definitely been working harder this week than I was the week before.’

MailOnline approached the estate agent for a comment.
