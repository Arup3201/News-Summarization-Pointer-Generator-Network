A man dressed as a penguin is being hunted by police after he stole 10 cans of Stella Artois from a shop.

The thief, wearing a full penguin onesie complete with yellow beak, walked into a Sainsbury's Local convenience store on Monday night where he made off with a crate of lager without paying.

Police said he shunned traditional disguises such as a balaclava or a motorcycle helmet before escaping the store in Coundon, County Durham, with beer worth £8.

Anyone seen this penguin? Police want to track down this suspected shoplifter who they say took £8 worth of Stella Artois lager on Monday from a Sainsbury's Local convenience store in Coundon, County Durham

He is described as a white male in his 20s, and was wearing a black and white penguin onesie or fancy dress outfit with a yellow beak.

The thief entered the store just after 10pm and took a crate of lager containing ten cans of Stella Artois worth £8, the police appeal said.

Officers have released images of a suspected shoplifter, who was captured on CCTV before he took flight.

Acting Inspector Vicky Guthrie, of Durham Police, said: 'He would be quite conspicuous and made off on foot so may have come to the attention of someone in the area.'

Durham Police have asked anyone who can identify him to contact them on 101. 

Scene of the crime: The theft happened at this Sainsbury's branch in the village of Coundon, County Durham
