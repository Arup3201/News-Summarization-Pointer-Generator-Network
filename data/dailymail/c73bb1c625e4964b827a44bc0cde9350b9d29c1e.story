Nasa's New Horizons spacecraft has captured stunning images of two of Pluto's moons on its approach to the dwarf planet.

Nix and Hydra are visible in images taken from a distance of 115 million miles (186 million km), revealing the best-ever view of them.

These are the first of a series of long-exposure images that will improve our understanding of the Plutonian system.

Scientists in Colorado have revealed new images of the Pluto system. In the images (shown) the tiny moons Nix (highlighted in the orange diamond) and Hydra (yellow) can be seen orbiting. The bright and dark streak extending to the right of Pluto is an artifact of the camera electronics, resulting from overexposure

The moons are two of the five known to be orbiting Pluto - the others being Charon, Styx and Kerberos.

In July this year New Horizons will become the first spacecraft ever to visit Pluto.

It was launched on 19 January 2006 at a speed of 36,373 mph (58,536 km/h) - the fastest spacecraft ever to leave Earth orbit, 100 times faster than a jetliner

After passing the orbits of all the major planets from Earth to Neptune, New Horizons is now beginning its final leg of its 3 billion-mile (4.8 billion km) journey.

On 14 July 2015 the flyby of Pluto will begin. Using a suite of instruments, the spacecraft will map the surface of Pluto and its moon Charon to a resolution of 25 miles (40km) - far better than anything possible before.

This will reveal the surface features of Pluto - which may include ice.

As it flies past, it will also look back at the two bodies against the sun, to look for telltale signs of an atmosphere.

Despite the long journey, New Horizons will be travelling at such a speed that the flyby will last only around two hours - beginning at 11.49am GMT (06.49am EST) on 14 July and ending just after 2.15pm GMT (9.15am EST).

After passing Pluto, New Horizons will flyby one or several Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), other bodies beyond the orbit of Pluto. The mission will officially end in 2026.

Charon is by far the largest, just over half the size of Pluto, while the others are much, much smaller.

Pluto measures about 1,470 miles (2,370km) across, whereas Nix and Hydra are each between 25 to 95 miles (40 to 150km) across - although their precise sizes won't be known until New Horizons gets closer.

'It's thrilling to watch the details of the Pluto system emerge as we close the distance to the spacecraft's July 14 encounter,' said New Horizons science team member Dr John Spencer, from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado.

'This first good view of Nix and Hydra marks another major milestone, and a perfect way to celebrate the anniversary of Pluto's discovery.'

These images were taken almost exactly 85 years after the discovery of Pluto by American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh in 1930.

In a tribute to the discoverer of the dwarf planet, and also the region at the edge of the solar system known as the Kuiper belt, some of his ashes are travelling on board the New Horizons spacecraft.

'Professor Tombaugh's discovery of Pluto was far ahead its time, heralding the discovery of the Kuiper Belt and a new class of planet,' said Dr Alan Stern, New Horizons principal investigator, also from the Southwest Research Institute.

'The New Horizons team salutes his historic accomplishment.'

The moons can be seen here orbiting Pluto. Hydra (in yellow), Pluto's outermost known moon, orbits Pluto every 38 days at a distance of approximately 40,200 miles (64,700 km), while Nix (in orange) orbits every 25 days at a distance of 30,260 miles (48,700 km)

In July this year New Horizons will become the first spacecraft ever to visit Plut (illustration shown). It was launched on 19 January 2006 at a speed of 36,373 mph (58,536 km/h) - the fastest spacecraft ever to leave Earth orbit, 100 times faster than a jetliner

Pluto is an extremely distant world, orbiting the sun more than 29 times farther than Earth.

It is about two thirds the size of our moon.

With a surface temperature estimated to be -229°C (-380°F), the environment at Pluto is far too cold to allow liquid water on its surface.

Pluto's moons are also in the same frigid environment.

The moon Charon is almost half the size of Pluto.

The moon is so big that Pluto and Charon are sometimes referred to as a double dwarf planet system.

The distance between them is 12,200 miles (19,640 km).

Charon's orbit around Pluto takes 6.4 Earth days.

Charon neither rises nor sets, but hovers over the same spot on Pluto's surface.

The same side of Charon always faces Pluto - this is called tidal locking.

Compared with most of the planets and moons, the Pluto-Charon system is tipped on its side. 

The discovery of these two moons fairly late, though, in June 2005, has led some to worry that there may be other either smaller moons in orbit around Pluto, which could pose a problem for New Horizons as it flies past the dwarf planet on 14 July.

These latest images were assembled into a seven-frame movie, revealing the spacecraft's first extended look at Hydra and its first-ever view of Nix.

The images were made using the Lorri (Long Range Reconnaissance Imager) camera on New Horizons, but as they are so small and dark they were fairly hard to spot.

Nix and Hydra were discovered by New Horizons team members in Hubble Space Telescope images taken in 2005.  

Hydra, Pluto's outermost known moon, orbits Pluto every 38 days at a distance of approximately 40,200 miles (64,700 km), while Nix orbits every 25 days at a distance of 30,260 miles (48,700 km). 

Pluto's two other small moons, Styx and Kerberos, are still smaller and too faint to be seen by New Horizons at its current range to Pluto; they will become visible in the months to come.

And on 14 July at 11.49am GMT (6.49am EST), New Horizons will make its historic flyby of the Plutonian system - although owing to the large distances involved, we won't know for a few hours how successful the mission was as the signals make their way back to earth. 

This image, taken by Nasa's Hubble Space Telescope, shows five moons orbiting the distant, icy dwarf planet Pluto. Styx (initially designated P5), is the innermost of the moons found by Hubble over the past seven years. This image was taken with Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3 on 7 July 2012

New Horizons will pass within 6,200 miles (10,000km) of Pluto, revealing our best ever view of the dwarf planet and its surrounding system. In this illustration Pluto is on the left, and its large moon Charon - which is half the size of Pluto - is on the right
