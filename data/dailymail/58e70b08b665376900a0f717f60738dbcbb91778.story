A Pennsylvania high school footballer player will face charges of assault and disorderly conduct after pulling off an on-field opponent's helmet and beating him with it.

The unsportsmanlike behavior was caught on camera during the third quarter of a game between Annville-Cleona High School and Hamburg High School on September 6.

The video shows a brawl erupting among players during which punches were thrown.

According to the Reading Eagle, Hamburg coach Joe Sinkovich has been accused by parents of encouraging a violent culture among his players, citing videos taken of him encouraging Cominsky to throw balls at the stomach of another player.

Coach Sinkovich has recently stepped down after nine seasons as the coach of the Hamburg Hawks.

He told the PennLive that neither incident had anything to do with his choice to stand down.

The South Annville Township police announced Wednesday that the Hamburg student would be charged as a juvenile.

Cominsky was initially punished with a two-game suspension.

Following a two-month investigation, the charges were filed against the youth yesterday.

In a press release, police said, 'The South Annville Police Department upon completion of their investigation have filed charges for Simple Assault and Disorderly Conduct in regards to the incident that took place on the playing field on Sept. 6, 2013 during the Annville/Cleona-Hamburg Football Game. Due to the case involving Juveniles, no other information will be released.'

It is unclear if Cominsky is the only player charged in the incident.
