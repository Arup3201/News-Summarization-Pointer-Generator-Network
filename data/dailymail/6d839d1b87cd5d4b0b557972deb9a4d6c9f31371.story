Models 1 and ASOS announce the winner of their latest search for the next plus-size model.

Lauren Punter, 20, from Leicester, beat a record breaking 8,000 entrants to bag a modelling contract, photo shoot and shopping spree.

The size 18 beauty, who works as a sales assistant, dreamed of being a model but never thought her wish might actually come true until she uploaded a selfie on Instagram with the hashtag #makemeacurvemodel.

'I dreamed about being a model one day, but it was always just a dream,' she says.

'I have always watched America's Next Top Model and would walk around my house pretending to be on a catwalk. I looked up to all those girls.

'Even though I was a different body shape I thought it would be amazing to be a model, and what a fantastic career it would be.

'Now I hope to have a successful and long-lasting career in modelling, though I would like to pursue acting at some point.

'I feel so proud and grateful to be representing plus-size models and women alike so I would ideally love to get involved in workshops to make people aware of the curve side of the modelling industry to encourage girls just like me.

'Being a good role model to these girls is of utmost importance to me.'

She took her chances by applying at the very last minute - and ended up beating thousands of female UK entrants size 18+ and aged 17-28 to win a Models 1 Curve contact, shoot at ASOS Studio and £500 worth of ASOS vouchers.

'I follow 
Models1 so I saw it on their Instagram and entered the competition on the 
final day - I don't know if that brought me some kind of luck!

'I have 
never done anything like this or entered a competition like this before.
 I thought it was an amazing opportunity and as I have followed Models 1
 for some time now and seen the calibre of models that they represent, I
 thought a competition such as this could open up doors for girls 
like me.

'In
 general the prospect of walking into a model agency can be daunting so 
being able to enter this competition by taking a selfie was the perfect 
platform for me. It was too good an opportunity to let pass by.'

After 
making it to the top 10 stage, Lauren attended a casting day at the 
Models 1 Head Office where she met members of the Models 1 and ASOS 
team.

They
 interviewed and photographed her so she could be judged on the 
following criteria; Beauty, Shape, Personality, Interesting features, 
Fit and Healthy appearance.

She was selected as one of the top five entrants who were then invited to Models 1 and ASOS HQ for a final day of casting, where they had their hair and make-up done and took part in a catwalk and photo-shoot. A 
judging panel from ASOS and Models 1 along with an independent judge 
fashion photographer, Simon Wisbey deliberated and decided on a winner.

'The whole day from start to finish was amazing,' says Lauren.

'Meeting all finalists and bonding with them, encouraging each other to working with the teams at ASOS and Models1 - they were so helpful. It was such a nice and relaxed day. I loved my outfit for the shoot which I got to keep!

'My
 parents are overjoyed and really proud of me and they're glad I've 
found something that I love to do! My mum cried when I called her 
because she was ecstatic!'

She is now brimming with confidence but it took her a while to settle into her own skin.

'I wasn't 
happy with my body for a long time and tried almost everything to change
 it; exercise, diets etc,' she tells MailOnline.

'But now I can say I'm finally feeling happy in 
my own skin. I've embraced my curves and realised that they are a gift 
and I'm blessed because by being curvy it's bought this new career 
prospect into my life.'

An ASOS spokesperson says: 'In line with ASOS, Models 1 know the importance of a healthy body image in all shapes and sizes - it is important to represent healthy girls. Lauren's Instagram pictures were great but the moment 
that she walked in we knew instantly we had found a winner who was a 
true ASOS girl with real star quality'.

A Models 1 spokesperson says: 'We wanted to open their doors to a wider
 audience by utilising the power of social media and assuaging those 
initial nerves. We believe that beauty comes in different sizes. Laurens
 is gorgeous and such a natural beauty. She was confident but so humble.

'We
 are absolutely delighted with the success of the competition and the 
calibre of the entrants.  There has never been a better time to be a 
curvy model. Demand for our curvy girls just keeps growing and it is not
 just the size 12, 14 and 16s that are in demand, brands are looking for
 size 18 and 20 curves. We were so impressed by the girls that made it 
through to the final and we really look forward to developing Lauren's 
modelling career.'
