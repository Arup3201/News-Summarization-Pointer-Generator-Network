Chelsea’s pre-season has been the perfect one in the sense that some matches and displays have given reason for confidence, others exposed glaring holes in the set-up.

Impressive wins over the likes of Fenerbahce and Ferencvaros have been compounded by limp efforts as seen against Werder Bremen.

On Tuesday night, Real Sociedad visit Stamford Bridge in the final friendly before Chelsea's trip to Burnley next Monday.

VIDEO Chelsea need games - Mourinho 

The good news for Blues fans is that new signings Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas have been the star turns, while a number of the club's youngsters may have earned themselves a spot in Jose Mourinho's reckoning for the campaign ahead.

Equally, Didier Drogba's injury and the continued misfiring of Fernando Torres give a worrying vision of Chelsea's attack were Costa not available.

It doesn't seem like there will be a surfeit of first team exits from Stamford Bridge, but there are still a couple of starting roles up for grabs.

Here, Sportsmail looks at the players - old and young - who still have something to prove before the big kick-off.

Ramires

The Brazil midfielder’s usual boundless energy was not enough to make up for his wayward passing and ill-discipline on the field last season, and with the arrival of Cesc Fabregas it looks as if Ramires will find first-team chances far harder to come by this season.

Straight on the back of Brazil's World Cup nightmare comes a question over the starting berths of Chelsea charges Ramires, Willian and Oscar.

However, Mourinho is still a stickler for physicality and work-rate and Ramires is fresh from netting a scorcher in Sunday’s friendly against Ferencvaros.

He is also one of the few players remaining from the club’s victorious Champions League campaign in 2012 – with the Portuguese manager on the lookout for experience in a dressing room shorn of Ashley Cole and Frank Lampard.

Impress at Stamford Bridge and Mourinho could well be looking for that experience for a potentially tricky opening Monday night at Burnley.

Fernando Torres

Torres has had more last chances than anyone else in the last few years at Stamford Bridge, but he remains one of just three senior strikers at the club – and returning 36-year-old Drogba is now facing an injury lay-off.

Last season fell at the final hurdle thanks to a lack of striking options, and having just Torres and Diego Costa available hasn’t done much to alleviate fears of the same problem rearing it's head.

The Spaniard has added to his collection of close-range misses in this pre-season campaign, and will have to cap a good display against Sociedad with a goal if Mourinho isn’t to be tempted into a last dip into the transfer market.

Petr Cech

Having been such a world class performer in goal for Chelsea for almost a decade should mean Cech has no place on a list like this, but Thibaut Courtois’ arrival from a long-term loan at Atletico Madrid changes the No 1 situation considerably.

The Czech stopper did little to impress in conceding Besiktas’ late goal in last week’s friendly, and a goalkeeper of such talent shouldn’t be forced to stay on the bench as his career enters its final third.

A typically commanding display in this match would make Mourinho’s most difficult decision even more unpalatable.

Branislav Ivanovic

Like Cech, a stalwart of the Chelsea defence, whose quality and experience cannot be easily dismissed. However, with Filipe Luis’ arrival at left back, the Serbia may face a fight for the right-back berth with Cesar Azpilicueta.

There is no doubt there is a need for all of these players in the squad – particularly with Ivanovic’s ability to play in a centre half positon where Chelsea look light – but one will miss out on the majority of starting XIs.

Ivanovic’s impressive pre-season so far should continue against Sociedad, and if he can cap off his usual defensive efforts with a goal from a set-piece he’ll have all the more reason to be confident heading into the new season.

Patrick Bamford

The 20-year-old striker seems destined for another loan move after spells at MK Dons and Derby, but Drogba's injury may have made Mourinho re-think.

Make no bones about it, if Chelsea are to challenge on all fronts they need another striker. Although raw and not the complete forward, Bamford is clinical in the box to a degree which the current iteration of Torres can only dream of.

If he plays on Tuesday night and grabs a goal or two, Mourinho will find it hard to rule him out of the reckoning.

The only issue would be whether he would be better served by regular football on loan.
