A British Embassy convoy in Libya has come under fire in an attempted carjacking, as Britons were urged to leave the country immediately.

Embassy staff escaped unscathed from the attack which occurred this morning between Tripoli and Zawiya, a city in northwestern Libya.

Michael Aron, the UK's ambassador to Libya, wrote on Twitter: 'There was an attempted carjacking on a British Embassy convoy this morning. Shots were fired at our vehicles but all staff safe.'

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) updated its travel advice to state: 'British nationals in Libya should leave now by commercial means.'

The battle for control of Tripoli's international airport began two weeks ago when Islamist-led militias launched a surprise assault on the airport, under control of rival militias from the western mountain town of Zintan.  On Saturday, the U.S. evacuated its diplomats in Tripoli to neighboring Tunisia and shut its embassy

The United States closed its embassy yesterday and safely evacuated its diplomats by road to neighbouring Tunisia, escorted by F-16 fighter jets.

Mr Aron said the attempted carjacking occurred between the capital Tripoli and Zawiya, which is en route to the Tunisian border.

The British Embassy remains open but with reduced staff and a limited ability to provide consular assistance.

The FCO warned about the 'greater intensity of fighting' in Tripoli and the likelihood of further attacks on foreigners.

There are believed to be between 100 and 300 Britons in the north African country.

Tripoli International Airport was closed a fortnight ago following clashes between armed groups nearby.

A number of foreigners have been shot dead in Libya since December and further attacks are expected.

There is a high threat of terrorism, and several foreigners have been kidnapped this year.

The FCO warned: 'Violent clashes between armed groups are possible across the country, including in Tripoli, particularly at night.

'Fighting can break out in many places and at short notice. It can become serious quickly putting those in the area at risk. You should remain vigilant at all times.

'Keep a low profile and try to limit travelling around as much as possible, particularly at night. There is a high threat from crime.'

Libya is now witnessing one of its worst spasms of violence since Colonel Gaddafi's regime was toppled, with US, UK and French military support. Gaddafi died in 2011 after rebels caught up with his convoy in Sirte.

Smoke rises in Tripoli on Thursday July 24

In Tripoli, the militias are fighting mostly for control of the airport. They are on the government's payroll since authorities have depended on them to restore order.

The battle in Tripoli began earlier this month when Islamist-led militias — mostly from the western city of Misrata — launched a surprise assault on the airport, under control of rival militias from the western mountain town of Zintan. On Monday, a $113 million Airbus A330 passenger jet for Libya's state-owned Afriqiyah Airways was destroyed in the fighting.

The rival militias, made up largely of former anti-Gaddafi rebels, have forced a weeklong closure of gas stations and government offices. In recent days, armed men have attacked vehicles carrying money from the Central Bank to local banks, forcing their closure.

Libyan government officials and activists have increasingly been targeted in the violence. Gunmen kidnapped two lawmakers in the western suburbs of Tripoli a week ago and on Friday armed men abducted Abdel-Moaz Banoun, a well-known Libyan political activist in Tripoli, according to his father.
