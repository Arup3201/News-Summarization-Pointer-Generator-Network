Mary Goble, 99, was forced to crawl up stairs to her home after the lift at her block of flats broke down

A 99-year-old great-grandmother has been forced to crawl up two flights of stairs to her flat for two weeks because the lift is broken.

Mary Goble, who is disabled after contracting shingles, says she has been left a prisoner in her own home as she waits for the repair work at the nine-storey building in Birmingham, West Midlands.

The great-grandmother-of-eight attempted to leave the house to buy groceries, but after realising she would have to go up the stairs on her hands and knees, she has vowed not to go out again.

She said: 'I went to go and get some food in but when I got back realised I would have to crawl upstairs on my hands and knees.

'I had to pull myself up knee by knee, it's outrageous - these stairs are very steep.

'I was in pain and when I got to the top I was exhausted. It nearly knocked me out.'

The partially-sighted widow, who lives alone, was left with limited mobility in her hands and arms after she developed shingles.

She believes the lifts at Beech Hill House in Bartley Green, Birmingham, are more than six decades old.

She added: 'This lift should've been dealt with a long time ago. They should've realised that, with a lift that's 60-years-old. It is dangerous.

'I normally wake up in the morning and think "I must do something and get out, buy some flowers or go to the shop".

'But if you go out you've got to crawl back up the stairs again.

'The only way people can get in and out is up and down the stairs. Other people have complained to the housing department about this.

'I feel for the others living here. Most of them are aged 45 or over and some are disabled.'

Residents were told in a letter  from the Bartley Green housing team that the lift was broken.

Work by Birmingham City Council's contractors began last Wednesday but tenants were warned repairs could take up to a fortnight.

Bartley Green housing team wrote: 'As you may be aware there has been a major fault with the lift in your tower block, which has resulted in a limited lift service to the tenants.

'We apologise for the inconvenience that this has caused.

'An Otis technician will be onsite from Wednesday preparing the lift for the essential repairs.

'The engineer has estimated that it may take up to two weeks for the repairs to be completed, however due to the work already completed this should be reduced.

'Please be aware that when the full installation starts there will be no lift service for the duration of the installation period, and the overall completion date is estimated as December 12, 2014.

'Again we apologise for the inconvenience this will cause and assure you that all is being done to ensure the lift is back in service as soon as possible.'

Birmingham's former Tory cabinet member for housing Councillor John Lines  said: 'This is the twenty-first century what are we talking about? Can't they fix a lift for pensioners?'

Nobody from Birmingham City Council was available to comment.
