More than two hundred people were
feared missing after a boat sank in Democratic Republic of
Congo's waters on Lake Tanganyika on Thursday night, a senior
Tanzanian official said on Sunday.

Amid what it said were conflicting reports of the death
toll, the Congolese government said in a statement read on
national television on Sunday that it had sent a mission led by
Transport Minister Kalumba Mwana Ngongo to the scene of the
accident, some 90 km (55 miles) south of the town of Kalemie.

U.N. radio in Congo, Radio Okapi, said on Friday that at
least 26 people had died and authorities had rescued 221 people
after the boat sank in the vast lake.

The vessel was carrying 500 people on Lake Tanganyika between Katanga and South Kivu 

Radio Okapi said it was not clear how many people were
travelling in the boat, which was carrying passengers between
Katanga and South Kivu provinces in eastern Congo. However,
local officials were quoted as saying on Sunday that more than
100 people had died.

Tanzanian authorities said the vessel had been carrying some
500 people.

'It was carrying about 500 people and about 230 people have
been rescued so far,' Deputy Inspector General of Police
Abdulrahman Kaniki told Reuters by telephone, attributing the
information to the head of the Tanzanian marine police.

Many boats in Congo carry far more people and cargo than are listed.
