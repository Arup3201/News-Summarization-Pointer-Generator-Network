Defending response time: Assistant Commissioner Simon Byrne said the first officers were on scene within nine minutes of the 999 call

Police sought to defend their response to the Woolwich terror attack last night by suggesting the attackers could have laid a trap.

Commanders at Scotland Yard suspected the savage killers were waiting for officers to arrive so they could set off hidden explosives.

This is why they chose to send in firearms officers who did not arrive at the scene of the carnage for 14 minutes.

That left their uniformed colleagues to stand on the sidelines while three brave women confronted the killers.

Local officers had taken nine minutes to arrive, even though Woolwich police station was 300 yards away. They waited helplessly as dozens of bystanders milled around the scene of horror and traffic continued to flow.

Even after police marksmen fired shots at the terrorists, members of the public could be seen yards away.

Last night, one Metropolitan Police source said: ‘The unarmed officers were effectively keeping a cordon. Both guys were wearing heavy coats and keeping a distance between us and them was a priority.

Waiting for police: Witnesses said this blood-covered man, named as Michael Adebolajo, walked the street clutching weapons and talking to passers-by with cameras for up to 20 minutes before officers arrived

Stayed put: Onlookers said the suspected attackers walked around the body while they waited for police

Conversation: Another suspected attacker holding a knife speaks to Cub Scout leader Ingrid Loyau-Kennett who tried to persuade him to hand over his weapons

No cordon: It was a while after armed police arrived and shot two men (one circled right) before officers cordoned off the area around the soldier's body (circled left)

‘Questions were immediately asked 
about why you would commit such an offence and wait for police. These 
are the kind of tactics seen employed by Palestinians in Israel.

‘Detonate a bomb, wait for the emergency services to arrive and then walk in with a suicide vest.’

Assistant Commissioner Simon Byrnet said unarmed officers arrived 
at John Wilson Street within nine minutes of the first of hundreds of 
999 calls to flood into their control room.

It is understood that among the officers was at least one armed with a Taser but he was told to stand by.

The officers radioed developments to 
senior staff who were able to watch the tense stand-off via a CCTV 
camera mounted on a traffic island.

On patrol: Soldiers outside Woolwich Barracks today, just 200 yards from the murder scene

Army base: Despite its close proximity to the scene, it appears soldiers at the barracks were unaware of the incident on Wednesday afternoon

Tribute: Two police officers rearrange flowers at the scene of the attack in Woolwich

Soldier: Tributes were left to the victim Drummer Lee Rigby, who was named the day after the attack

Handwritten: Flowers and notes were left at the scene in Woolwich in honour of the dead soldier

When their armed colleagues finally arrived, witnesses described how the men suddenly aggressively ran at them.

'Police just stood there. It was only after shots were fired that officers appeared and started shouting at everyone to "get back"'

Eyewitness

One of the men attempted to fire a revolver, which misfired and injured his hand. The other wielded a meat cleaver.

Several shots were fired and both men,
one of whom is in a serious condition, were last night under armed 
guard in separate London hospitals.

One eyewitness said: ‘It was surreal. 
Many people did not even realise what had taken place and thought it was
a car crash. Police just stood there. It was only after shots were 
fired that officers appeared and started shouting at everyone to “get 
back”.’

Scotland Yard said it took four minutes for armed officers to be assigned and ten minutes for them to arrive.

Protest: Mr Byrne called for calm after police clashed with English Defence League members in Woolwich last night

Assistant commissioner Mark Rowley said it was a ‘good decision’ to wait for armed response officers to confront the men.

He said the Met expects armed officers to respond to incidents in around 12 minutes, but they can be delayed by traffic.

'If those guys had run amok it could have been a completely different story. Instead they stood there and effectively attempted suicide by cop'

John Tully, Metropolitan Police Federation chair

This figure contrasts with statistics 
from Greater Manchester Police which show armed officers arrive at 
incidents, on average, in less than four minutes.

John Tully, chair of the Metropolitan 
Police Federation, said the speed of armed response vehicles was a ‘big 
issue’ in London policing.

‘If you go back to the mid-1980s every 
division had a cadre of firearms trained officers and there would be 
weapons kept at stations,’ he added.

‘If there was an incident the 
inspector would assign qualified people to get a weapon and go to it. 
That was before armed response vehicles.

'Revenge attacks': This mosque in Gillingham was targeted the evening after the soldier was killed

Graffiti: A mosque more than 200 miles from the scene in Bolton was vandalised on Wednesday

In custody: In a separate incident, a man was arrested on suspicion of possessing a knife and attempted arson at the Al-Falah Islamic Centre in Braintree, Essex

'ARVs are all well and good but 
they are only as effective as how quickly they can get somewhere. They 
need to be properly resourced.

‘The number of ARVs going around London is not very many. It is a very limited resource.

‘If we are going to continue with it, and the other option is routine arming, it needs to be more robustly resourced.

‘If those guys had run amok it could 
have been a completely different story. Instead they stood there and 
effectively attempted suicide by cop.’

The Met has between 13 and 21 armed 
response vehicles on patrol depending on the time of day and whether any
specific risks have been identified.

These include members of the 
diplomatic protection group, who patrol central London, and specialist 
officers from what is now called SCO19.

Len Duvall, a London Assembly member 
who represents Woolwich, said the police were put in ‘difficult 
circumstances’ and had to make ‘judgment calls’.

Jenny Jones, a London Green politician
who scrutinises the Met, defended the incident response time, saying it
was ‘perfectly reasonable’ given the complex circumstances the officers
had to face.

Witnesses to the incident are asked to send film clips and still photographs of what happened to woolwich@metincident.co.uk or call the Anti-Terrorist Hotline on 0800 789 321.

Police hunt: Officers were raiding homes around the country today in relation to the attack in Woolwich

Hoodie: A Help for Heroes top like the one the murdered soldier was wearing

The soldier killed by two crazed 
fanatics just yards from the Woolwich Barracks was wearing a Help for 
Heroes top when he was attacked.

The
young serviceman was hit by a car and crushed into a road sign on the 
street in south-east London before he was brutally murdered.

Video
footage showed the dead man was wearing a dark blue top with white 
writing on it - which is believed to be the same as the Help for Heroes 
hoodie (right).

The killers
attacked him with a collection of weapons including meat cleavers and 
knives before waiting for police to arrive, their hands covered in 
blood.

Today members of the public were donating to the charity which helps wounded troops with their rehabilitation.

One
man called Allan Beattie who donated to the charity wrote: 'In memory 
of the soldier brutally murdered yesterday (Wednesday) - rest in peace - and a thank
you to all of our brave service men and women who do so much for us'

Kelly
Alexander, who also gave to the charity wrote: 'Last night a black 
cloud went over our country,it will never be the same again,Rip to this 
young man brutally slain in his home country.I salute you x'
