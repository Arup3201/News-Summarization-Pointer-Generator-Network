A body was found today in the search for the missing wife of a Marine.

The body, discovered in Riverside California, has not been positively identified as 22-year-old Brittany Kilgore, who has been missing since Friday night, San Diego sheriff's Captain Duncan Frasier said.

However, a woman has been arrested on suspicion of murder in the case.

Missing: Brittany Killgore was last seen on Friday with a marine who was later arrested on an unrelated charge

The news came after it was announced that the missing woman's estranged husband - a Marine in Afghanistan - will return to California on emergency leave as authorities try to determine whether she met with foul play.

Brittany Killgore, 22, went missing after filing for divorce last week from Lance Corporal Cory Killgore.

Her cellphone was found in the Gaslamp District of downtown San Diego, but authorities said it was unclear whether she actually left Fallbrook, where she lives.

Investigators said she had been seen with another Marine named Louis Ray Perez, 45, but authorities have not disclosed the nature of their relationship.

Cory Killgore, 22, could be back at 
Camp Pendleton by the end of the week, said 1st Lieutenant Alex Lim, a 
spokesman for the 1st Marine Division.

'One of his loved ones is missing and I can only hope the best for him,' Lim said.

Authorities have said Killgore is not suspected in the disappearance of his wife.

'We do believe that there is a strong
likelihood that Brittany was the victim of foul play,' sheriff's 
spokeswoman Jan Caldwell said.

Brittany Killgore lives in northern San Diego County, not far from Camp Pendleton.

Perez was arrested Sunday on an 
unrelated charge of possessing a stolen AR-15 rifle from Camp Pendleton.
He remained jailed on $500,000 bail and has refused to cooperate with 
investigators.

Cory Killgore was deployed to Afghanistan earlier this year as a vehicle operator.

'Everyone attempts to move at the 
speed of light in Afghanistan when there's a bonafide emergency,' Lim 
said about Killgore's return to California. 'It's always been "mission 
first, Marine always."'

Brittany Killgore had told friends she was 
going to 
spend Friday evening in the Gaslamp Quarter in San Diego. Police do not 
think she ever made it there, but her cell phone was recovered in the 
area.

San Diego County Sheriff's 
Department search-and-rescue teams searched a canyon near Fallbrook in 
the hope of finding the missing woman on Monday. Officers also searched her apartment.

Sheriff's lieutenant Larry Nesbit said 
Perez, who is based at Camp Pendleton, was questioned about Killgore's 
disappearance.

In an interview for KTLA 5 News Nesbit added: 'Based on the totality of the circumstances - the fact that she is in
normally in constant contact with her friends but she has not been heard from since Friday and the fact that
Mr Perez was less than forthcoming in his interview with us - we believe that
there there is a strong likelihood Brittany is the victim of foul play.'

Ms Killgore was last seen wearing a 
dark purple evening gown, with purple floral glitter patterns. She is 5 
ft 7 inches, 130 pounds with brown hair and brown eyes, according to the
Sheriffâ€™s department.
