Apple's new CEO Tim Cook knew that he was facing an impossible task when he was tapped as the one to fill Steve Job's iconic turtleneck.

'Steve was a genius and a visionary… He’s an irreplaceable person. Steve was an original and I don’t think there is another one of those being made. I’ve never felt the weight of trying to be Steve. It’s not who I am and it’s not my goal in life,' Mr Cook said at a recent technology conference.

'I learned a lot from Steve. It was absolutely the saddest days of my life when he passed away.

Opening up: Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke at the All Things Digital tech conference in California on Tuesday

'At some point late last year, somebody kind of shook me and said, it’s time to get on. That sadness was replaced by his intense determination to continue the journey.

Without revealing too many details from the labs of the notoriously-secretive company, Mr Cook said that while Mr Jobs was always going to be remembered and honored, the best way to do so would be to continue his legacy by moving forward with their various endeavors.

'I love museums, but I don't want to live in one,' he said.

'He also taught me the joy is in the journey and that was a revelation for me.'

Where that journey will lead is the next question for many Apple observers, as the company's acquisitions are closely monitored.

The television arena is one that is expected to be on the company's radar, and Mr Cook's comments at the All Things Digital conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, California confirmed the theories. The annual conference was hosted by The Wall Street Journal which posted a video of his interview.

Apple already produces set-top box product for televisions, called Apple TV, and they plan to 'keep pulling this string and see where it takes us,' implying that it certainly is not going to be their last product in that field.

'This is an area of intense interest for us,' Mr Cook said, though he refused to answer the question of whether or not Apple is developing a television set.

Hobby: Mr Cook's recent comments confirm theories that the company's next big move will be in the direction of the television industry

In previous interviews, the $99 Apple TV unit has been dubbed a 'hobby' within the company, and at the conference he reaffirmed such a title saying that it would remain as such even though Apple is not known for being a 'hobby kind of company'.

'It’s not a fifth leg of the stool. It’s not of the same market size of the phone business or the Mac business or the music business or the tablet business,' Yahoo News reports Mr Cook saying. 

Secretive: In keeping with Apple's notoriously closely-guarded ways, Mr Cook did not reveal any new acquisitions or plans

'Here's the way we would look at (television), not just at this area but other areas, and ask can we control the key technology? Can we make a significant contribution, far beyond what others have done in this area? Can we make a product that we would want?'

Mr Cook also discussed the tablet and smartphone market, maintaining an almost modest stance on Apple's role in shaping the two fields- marking a significant personality difference from that of Mr Jobs who was known for his dramatic boastfulness of his company's products.

'I wouldn’t say we dominate (the smartphone market). I’d say we have the best phone,' Mr Cook said.

'We didn’t invent the tablet market. It was there. We invented the modern tablet,' echoing himself.

Certain criticisms of the company were
also discussed, including their decision to base manufacturing in Asia 
as opposed to the U.S., which Mr Cook explained was a logistical move.

Factories in China have had multiple suicides, even installing nets to prevent stressed and tired workers from leaping to their deaths.

'Some
people want to work a lot. They want to move and work for a year or two
and then move back to their village and bring back as much money as 
they can,' Cook said.

Defining products: Mr Cook said that while they didn't create the 
smartphone and tablet markets, their products are the best in those 
fields

'On the assembly piece, could that be done in the U.S.? I hope so, again, one day.'

Another
point of tech-world gossip fascination is Apple's relationship with 
Facebook, a company whose grasp on the needs of the people is arguably 
one that Apple- and many others- want all for themselves.

Mr Cook denied that they are sworn enemies and had only positive comments when asked.

'Facebook is a great company. And the relationship is solid. I saw (Chief Operating Officer) Sheryl (Sandberg) earlier outside. We have great respect for each other,' he said.

'They have their way of doing things, but people say that about us as well. Just because they have a point of view doesn’t mean we can’t work with each other.'
