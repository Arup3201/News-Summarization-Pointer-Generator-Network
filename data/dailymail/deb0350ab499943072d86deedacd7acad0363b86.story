Making the most of the sunshine Cressida Bonas headed out in central London yesterday for a spot of shopping.

Cressie, as she’s known in her well-to-do circle, has been dating Prince Harry, 29, for the past two years.

She made the brave fashion choice of double denim for her outing and of course, the young fashionista pulled it off in style.

Despite her funky 90s inspired double denim look, Cressida looked a little glum

The 25-year-old paired dark skin tight jeans with a light denim shirt and Doc Martin boots

Pairing dark skin tight jeans with a 
light denim loose-fitting shirt in a style reminiscent of the 90s, the 
prince’s girlfriend strode along with her long hair lose around her shoulders.

In her usual low-key bohemian style, the 25-year-old completed the look with a pair of classic chunky black Doc Martin boots, bright red nails and minimal make-up.

However, while she may look causal, the socialite’s ensemble is far from economy, with the multi-tone patchwork Chambray Denim Shirt from Maison Scotch alone retailing at a hefty £112.

She looked liked she might have bought herself something nice as she carried a bag from high-end boutique Austique and  seemed to be in a world of her own.

Rumours has reached fever pitch over whether Harry, who has been dating Cressida for two years, is about to pop the question

Her distracted demeanor might be explained by the swirling rumours that Harry is imminently about to ask to marry her.

However despite growing ever closer to the prince, Cressida, 25, has told friends she has no plans of becoming a Royal bride within the next 12 months.

The blonde has recently purchased a flat in a trendy area of Shepherds Bush and has started a new job in marketing.
