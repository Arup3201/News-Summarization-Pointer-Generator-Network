Fifty Shades Of Grey has become the number one best-selling Kindle book of all time at Amazon.co.uk, it was revealed today.

Despite the trilogy only being published in March this year, the racy international best-sellers - dubbed 'mummy porn' - have sold over one million copies in the online store's Kindle department, while author EL James has become the bestselling author of the year on the site as a whole.

Phenomenon: EL James' trilogy is selling unusually well in ebook format - perhaps because people are embarrassed to be reading the racy books in public

James, originally a self-published Kindle Direct Publishing Author saw popularity of her book soar online after readers embarrassed to be seen with a hard copy of the racy tome preferred to buy online.

Modest beginnings: Fifty Shades Of Grey was orinigally Twilight fan fiction which EL gave away for free

The Kindle edition of ‘Fifty Shades of Grey’ is currently outselling the print book at a rate of more than 2 to 1.

'E L James’ books have become both the fastest-selling and the best-selling series ever on Kindle. That’s an exceptional achievement for a debut novelist and we’re excited to see her pass the one million sales milestone,' said Gordon Willoughby, spokesman for Kindle.

'Following a stint of self-publishing,
first online and then via KDP, EL James found a fan base and her 
success has rocketed from there.

'Her books have become a worldwide phenomenon demonstrating what a powerful launch pad KDP can be.'

In
addition to the sales success seen on Kindle, Fifty Shades Of Grey, 
Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed are the first, second and 
third best-selling print books at Amazon.co.uk and their combined sales 
have also made her the best-selling print author of the year so far.

Sales of the book, the first in a 
trilogy, have overtaken the Harry Potter books and the Da Vinci Code, to
the delight of not only James, but established romance writer Jilly Cooper.

Cooper yesterday credited James with reviving interest in the flagging 'bonkbuster' genre, saying: Porn was terribly out of fashion before 
that book came out. While I have heard that it is quite poorly written, I
am delighted that it’s giving a new lease of life to the genre.'

Fifty Shades writer James, whose real name is Erika Leonard, has said she thinks her books are successful because they offer women a 'holiday from their husbands'.
