The Daily Mail and the Big Lottery Fund today award more than £6million to charities and organisations helping to improve the lives of older people.

The joint initiative, known as the Silver Dreams Fund, is part of a wider campaign to distribute National Lottery grants totalling £110million to the most inspirational and worthy projects.

In the spirit of this paper’s long-running Dignity for the Elderly campaign, the money will be given to causes that enhance the lives of those over 50 and recognise the contribution they make to society.

The first tranche of the money is today awarded to 37 voluntary and community groups in England that will receive grants of up to £200,000 each. They include a farm project to ease loneliness in rural areas and a charity to help former Gurkhas resettle in England.

An appeal for nominations last October prompted an incredible response from charities and organisations which submitted nearly 1,500 applications for grants.

Daily Mail columnist Bel Mooney and 
three readers, David Searle, Christine Squires and Marilyn Tenbeth, 
joined Lottery representatives and independent experts to decide the 
winners.

The panel awarded 
grants of between £50,000 and £200,000 to the organisations to test and 
develop innovative ideas to help older people over 12 to 18 months.

Up to five of those projects, which all help those over 50 to cope with issues such as health, isolation and bereavement, will then receive up to £1million each to carry their ideas forward.

The panel’s choices will help determine how the rest of the £110million, which represents the Big Lottery Fund’s biggest single investment in older people, is spent between now and 2015.

The Big Lottery Fund has calculated that the money already allocated will benefit around 16,690 people directly, as well as helping 3,700 volunteers.

Charities and organisations that will
receive grants include Come Dine With Us, a lunch club in Durham which 
encourages healthy eating, and Care And Repair England, a charity which 
helps older people ensure building work is satisfactory.

Also
included is Future Roots, which helps older men in rural areas overcome
isolation and loneliness through therapeutic farming sessions, 
particularly with farm animals and horticulture.

Another
recipient is Winchester Area Community Action, established to improve 
the lives of former Gurkhas and other Nepali elders by helping them to 
settle in England.

Actress Joanna Lumley, who helped Gurkhas win the right  to settle in England in 2009,  said: ‘It was so moving to read  of the Big Lottery Fund’s decision to award this project a  large grant.’

Bel Mooney, Mail writer and advice 
columnist, said: ‘When I first wrote about the Silver Dreams Fund in the
Daily Mail last October I couldn’t have known just how exciting the 
whole initiative would prove to be.

‘The paper followed up with other articles; readers applied to be in the judging panel; so many imaginative and important projects were made known to us.

‘As one of the committee, together 
with three chosen Mail readers with wide experience in the voluntary 
sector, I was amazed and impressed by the wealth of energy now being 
directed towards the needs of older people and made possible by the Big 
Lottery Fund.

Charities and organisations that will receive grants include Care And Repair England, a charity which helps older people ensure building work is satisfactory

‘These matters
are close to the Mail’s heart, since our Dignity for the Elderly 
campaign is always on-going and we believe that a healthy society 
respects its older members, acknowledging our debt and committing 
ourselves to taking care of their needs.’

Nat
Sloane, chairman of the Big Lottery Fund England, said the projects 
chosen ‘would value and recognise the positive contribution older people
make to society now and into the future, and provide support that meets
their needs.’

The Big 
Lottery Fund, the largest distributor of National Lottery good cause 
funding, has awarded £3.6billion since it was set up in 2004.
