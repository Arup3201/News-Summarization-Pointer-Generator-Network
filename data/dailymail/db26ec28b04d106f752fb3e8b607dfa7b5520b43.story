A mural in a Thai temple has been criticised as 'totally inappropriate' for depicting the 9/11 terrorist attacks alongside comic book characters and celebrities.

The White Temple at Chiang Rai is the bizarre pet project of controversial Thai artist Chalermchai Kositpipat

As well as depicting planes flying into the Twin Towers, the mural at Chiang Rai features fictional characters such as Spiderman and Harry Potter, celebrities like Michael Jackson, as well as fighter jets and spaceships.

'Totally inappropriate': A mural in the Thai temple of Chiang Rai depicting the 9/11 terrorist attacks

The surreal painting, by Chalermchai Kositpipat, also features celebrities like Michael Jackson alongside fictional film characters, like the Terminator

Sci-fi films such as Star wars and The Matrix provide a lot of inspiration for the painting, which includes traditional Thai an Buddhist symbols such as demons and dragons

Po, the character voiced by Jack Black in Kung Fu Panda, also appears next to Jigsaw from horror series Saw

It is not just American blockbusters which adorn the walls, as Harry Potter also features riding a broom

The huge painting appears opposite a wall featuring a large Buddha and traditional Buddhist statues.

Photography inside the temple is forbidden, but one tourist managed to take this picture using a camera phone.

The 31-year-old insurance broker from Nottingham, who did not want to be named, said: 'The whole place is very strange. There's a pit full of hands and skulls outside that looks like something from the Walking Dead.

'Inside I was shocked to see a painting of planes flying into the Twin Towers. I just think it's totally inappropriate.'

The bizarre imagery continues outside the temple itself, with a sculpture of Predator sunk into the ground

Kositpipat first drew up designs for the temple in 1997 and began working on it with a team of assistants

The whole structure is not due to be completed until 2070, though it already serves as a tourist attraction

Designed by Kositpipat in 1997, the surreal temple is still under construction and isn't due to finish until 2070.

Kositpipat uses a team of 60 other artists to help him work on the building, and has passed designs on to them so they can continue working after he dies.

Another visitor to the temple, 38-year-old business owner Alexey Statsenko, said: 'It was so different from anything I had seen before.

'When we entered I was pretty shocked to see all those images from American popular culture- Michael Jackson, Terminator, Kung-Fu panda, Harry Potter and more.

'I did not know what to think of it. It seemed some kind of a mockery.

Posting on his blog, he added: 'Generally speaking it is an very out-of-the-box (for a Buddhist temple) and creative way of expressing one’s ideas.'

Like Dali's cathedral in Barcelona, Kositpipat has given designs to his staff to keep working after he dies

The artist claims he is emulating traditional Thai temple art, which features scene of ancient Thai life alongside Buddhist symbolism. But he has been heavily criticised for his approach

Artwork around the temple ranges from the macabre to the magnificent to the downright bizarre

Unlike most other Thai temples which are usually brightly painted, the outside of the White Temple is plain

The outside of the temple is covered with intricate artwork and thousands of tiny mirrors to reflect sunlight

Traditional Thai art symbols, such as dragons, also feature as part of the immense artwork

'Only death can stop my dream, but cannot stop my project,' he said in 2003, adding that he believes the work will give him 'immortal life'.

He is also behind the Wat Buddhapadipa temple in Wimbledon, London, which contains another controversial mural charting the life of Buddha from birth to death.

However, mixed in with symbols from traditional Thai culture are punks sporting Mohicans and leather jackets, Charlie Chaplin, and Margaret Thatcher.

Spiderman, Superman, Elvis Presley and other cartoon characters all adorn this wall inside the temple

Captain Jack Sparrow, Jonny Depp's character from Pirates of the Caribbean, surfs down Predator's arm

The temple also features Buddhist statues and paintings which sit opposite the mural

The artist claims this is in keeping with conventional Thai temple art which portrayed scenes from ancient Thai life alongside figures from Buddhist mythology.

However his work has attracted strong criticism. Speaking in 1998, shortly after the London murals were finished, he said: 'I got complaints from everybody – from the [Thai] government, from monks and from other artists, saying that what I was doing was not Thai art.'
