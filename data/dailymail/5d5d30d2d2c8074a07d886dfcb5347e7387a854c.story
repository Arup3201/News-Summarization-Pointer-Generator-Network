Police in Fort Collins, Colorado, have been brought in to investigate a cat-napping that occurred at the Armstrong Hotel on Saturday night.

Oreo Armstrong has been a fixture at the hotel since it reopened in 2004 and until Saturday could be found hanging around the lobby lapping up attention from guests and staff.

Video footage has revealed that the black and white cat was stolen on Saturday evening and the culprits are two men in their late teens/early 20s who came to the hotel’s front desk several times during the day requesting a room, said Nick Gliszinski, the hotel’s general manager.

Oreo Armstrong has been a fixture at the Armstrong Hotel in Fort Collins, Colorado, since it re-opened in 2004

The hotel is located in the Old Town Fort area, where St. Patrick's Day celebrations were in full swing and so front desk staff repeatedly told the men that there were no rooms available that night.

Video footage shows the men returned around 7:40 p.m. and lifted up Oreo and nonchalantly walking out the front door.

‘Who knows where she went from there?’ Gliszinski told Coloradoan.com.

Hotel staff have contacted local police with the video footage and a police report has been filed. Gilszinski has also reached out to area animal rescues, but to no avail.

‘She’s never been taken off property by anyone other than the owner,’ said Gliszinski. ‘We have never had an issue with this before.’

The hotel has cat doors throughout the building so that Oreo has her freedom to roam throughout during the day before she gets put in the executive offices for the evening.

The popular pet even has a Facebook page and has more than 700 friends.

Since news of her disappearance broke, guests have posted photos and messages of support for the missing animal, with one person offering $1,000 for her return and another $1,000 for the names of the men caught on the CCTV footage.
