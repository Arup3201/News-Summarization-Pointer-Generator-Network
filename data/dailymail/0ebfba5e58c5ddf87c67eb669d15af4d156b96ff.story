England and Wales Cricket Board managing director Paul Downton has denied that he has been contacted by Kevin Pietersen to discuss a potential return to the national team.

Pietersen has become optimistic his England career could yet be revived and reports on Tuesday claimed that the 34-year-old had held conversations with intermediaries acting for the ECB.

'He hasn't asked me for a meeting,' said Downton. 'As far as the ECB is concerned no position has changed. We put out a statement last week.'

Reports suggested that England outcast Kevin Pietersen had contacted the ECB over a return 

Pietersen has not ruled out an England return after comments made by incoming chairman Colin Graves

Downton was one of the key figures in casting Pietersen out of the England set-up following last year's 5-0 Ashes whitewash and when asked if he would consider a meeting with the South Africa-born batman, he added: 'I don't know what to say to that to be honest.

'It's not something that is at the forefront of the selectors' minds now. We've got a group of players that we are working with and looking to progress the England team.

'Nothing has changed from where we were in the last year.'

Incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves kick-started Pietersen's hopes of a return a fortnight ago when he suggested he should play county cricket if he was serious about playing for England again.

The ECB released a statement later that day to clarify Graves' comments which said 'nothing had changed' regarding Pietersen's England future.

Pietersen has nonetheless been impressed by Graves and on Tuesday morning backed the 67-year-old entrepreneur to make the changes to revitalise England in the wake of their early World Cup exit.

Pietersen alluded to a recent relaxation in ECB policy to allow players to be available for the entire Indian Premier League as a positive step and that he suspected it was the start of a progressive period under Graves.

Pietersen posted on Twitter: 'Quick note - ECB doesn't decide who gets to play in IPL/Big Bash. The franchises have to want them! Plenty have tried & failed to get a go!

'But, the encouraging news is that the new boss has the vision to look to open up a window to hopefully give players a better chance!

'I really do think changes are going to be made & positive things are going to start to happen for the good of English cricket...'

England's World Cup embarrassment has given ammunition to those who believe it was a mistake to axe Pietersen and while Graves' comments have forced the ECB to reinforce their stance on a player who left Surrey last autumn, Downton said it has not caused him any discomfort.

'What Colin said was absolutely right,' he said.

'To be picked for England you have to be scoring an awful amount of runs in county cricket and you have to be perceived by the selectors as a positive influence on the side.

'Nothing has changed.'
