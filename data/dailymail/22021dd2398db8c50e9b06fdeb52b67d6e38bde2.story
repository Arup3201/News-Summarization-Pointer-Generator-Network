It has been 16 years since Hearts and Rangers have arguably played in a match of such magnitude. It’s mere coincidence that the game would also be Ally McCoist’s last appearance as a player in the Light Blue.

The Tynecastle club triumphed 2-1 on that occasion, lifting the Scottish Cup to end a 36-year trophy drought. Tomorrow, the stakes are rather different — as are the circumstances of both clubs.

A win for either could go a long way to deciding the destination of the Championship title and an automatic ticket back to the top flight from which they had plunged in varying states of disarray.

Gary Naysmith, who played in that victory for Hearts at Celtic Park back in 1998, knows the rival bosses well. He played alongside Robbie Neilson at Tynecastle, while Ally McCoist coached him at international level with Scotland.

And the 36-year-old, currently player/manager of East Fife, believes a victory for his former side would pretty much seal the title before November is out.

‘It’s those two teams fighting it out at the top of the league and if Hearts win, I don’t see them losing a nine-point lead,’ said Naysmith.

‘It’s a massive game for Hearts because they have a great chance in front of 20,000 people to go nine clear after just more than a third of the season gone. But it’s an even bigger game for Rangers, because they know losing would see them fall so far behind.

‘I wouldn’t say Rangers have got a better squad and, with the players Robbie has assembled at Hearts, he would be disappointed not to win the league.

‘His priority at the start of the season would have been to get Hearts up but after such a good start, he will be wanting to go up as champions.

‘It’s all in Hearts’ hands and I think even a draw would suit them. Rangers need to win. So it’s going to be a cracking occasion and a definite sell-out.

‘Depending on the result, though, the games between Hearts and Rangers later on in the season could be even bigger than this one as the points may be closer.

‘But you have to make Hearts favourites because they’re six clear and playing at home.’

Should his side lose tomorrow, there are those speculating it may signal the beginning of the end of McCoist’s colourful tenure as manager of the club he loves. In a three-year spell, the all-time Rangers record scorer has been lauded for his off-the-field firefighting while facing regular questions over his ability to lead his side on the park.

Asked if he fears for McCoist’s future should they lose, Naysmith countered by insisting the 52-year-old has experience of dealing with such pressure.

‘The speculation is just the nature of the job,’ said Naysmith.

‘Rangers won seven on the bounce, then they draw against Alloa and all of a sudden Ally’s in the last-chance saloon. I think he’s probably immune to it by now. Water off a duck’s back.

‘While Rangers are in turmoil, they’re going to be front and back-page news. But Ally was used to being in the headlines as a player and it’s probably not that hard for him to cope with it.

‘He doesn’t let it affect him. When we played them recently, he came in before the game for 40 minutes for a cup of tea and a chat. Ally always makes time for you. I don’t know if that’s normal or that he just likes me because of our time with Scotland but he’s just a guy I really respect.

‘I think he’s done a good job because he has been the glue that’s held that club together. I’m not sure anyone else could have done that.

‘Also, they are second in the league behind a very good Hearts side and, if they cut it to three points on Saturday, then it’s all to play for.’

Naysmith worked alongside Neilson at East Fife before he was headhunted by the Tynecastle club and the East Fife boss believes Hearts’ start to the season – 11 wins, two draws, no defeats – clearly marks him out as the coming manager of Scottish football.

‘It’s a fantastic achievement to be 13 games unbeaten,’ he said.

‘They have only conceded seven goals and scored 35 goals so it’s working for Robbie at both ends.

‘Gary Locke and Billy Brown deserve credit, too, for giving the younger players experience of the Premiership last season. Robbie is getting the benefit from that, as well as the changes he has implemented himself.

‘Undoubtedly, his director of football, Craig Levein, will have advised him to sign guys like Prince Buaben and Morgaro Gomis, who he has worked with before at Dundee United. But Robbie Neilson’s his own man and he’s gone up and up in coaching and deserves all the credit in the world.’
