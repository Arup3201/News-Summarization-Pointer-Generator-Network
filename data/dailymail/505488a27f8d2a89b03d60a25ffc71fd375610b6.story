It's long been known the surface of Titan, a giant moon orbiting around Saturn, is covered in lakes but now never-before-seen images reveal new clues as to how these lakes may have formed.

The shots, taken by Nasa's Cassini spacecraft, were captured as the moon entered its Spring season, meaning the sun was shining down onto its north pole making it possible to capture them for the first time.

The near-infrared images show bright spots in the northern part of the lakes, suggesting the surface is unique from the rest of Titan, which 
might explain why almost all of the lakes are found in this region.

Images of the lakes near the north pole of Saturn's moon Titan, pictured, were taken by Nasa's Cassini spacecraft as it entered its Spring season. This shot shows the outline of the different lakes and bright spots seen in the northern part of the land suggest the surface is unique from the rest of Titan

The data also suggests parts of Titan's lakes and seas may have evaporated to leave behind the Titan equivalent of salt flats found on Earth. This evaporated liquid is thought to be made up of chemicals that come from particles in the haze that surrounds Titan that have been dissolved in liquid methane.

Titan's lakes have distinctive rounded 'cookie-cutter shapes with steep sides'. The explanations for how the lakes formed range
from the collapse of land following a volcanic eruption to so-called 
'karst' terrain, where liquids on the surface dissolve 
soluble bedrock.

Although there is one large lake and a 
few smaller ones near Titan's south pole, almost all of Titan's lakes surround its north pole.

Cassini captured the images during 
flybys of Titan on 10 and 26 July and 12 September. These flybys, 
coupled with the sunlight shining on the north pole and a lack of clouds
as the moon entered its Spring season gave a much clearer, close-up 
view.

'Ever since the lakes and 
seas were discovered, we've been wondering why they're concentrated at 
high northern latitudes,' said Elizabeth Turtle, a Cassini 
imaging team associate based at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics 
Laboratory in Maryland.

'Seeing that there's something special about
the surface in this region is a big clue to help narrow down the 
possible explanations.'

Scientists at Nasa's 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California study Titan's terrain 
using Cassini's visual and 
infrared mapping spectrometer.Â

Titan
is Saturn's largest moon - with a radius of appropriately 1,600 miles (2,574 
kilometers). It's bigger than planet Mercury and is the second-largest
moon in the solar system.

The
atmosphere of Titan is largely composed of nitrogen; minor components 
lead to the formation of methane and ethane clouds and nitrogen-rich 
organic smog.

The climate -
including wind and rain - creates surface features similar to those on 
Earth, including dunes, rivers, lakes and seas (probably of liquid 
methane and ethane), and deltas, and is dominated by seasonal weather 
patterns as on Earth.

Launched in 1997, Cassini has been 
exploring Saturn and its series of moons since 2004.

On Saturn, a full year is the 
equivalent to 30 Earth years, meaning Cassini has only been able to 
observe a third of a Saturn year.

Since 2004, Saturn and its moons have seen the seasons change from 
northern winter to northern summer.

Cassini revealed that Titan's 
surface is shaped by rivers and lakes of liquid ethane and methane (the 
main component of natural gas), during its initial flybys.

Scientists are interested in Titan because its atmosphere is most like that on Earth. Titan is said to resemble a 
frozen version of Earth, several billion years ago, before oxygen entered the atmosphere.

Images taken using this visual and infrared 
mapping spectrometer, which turns infrared colours into colours that can
be seen by the human eye, reveal differences in the composition of 
material around the 
lakes.

Yet, until now, they have only been able to capture distant or partial 
views of this area.

Linda 
Spilker, Cassini project scientist at Nasa's Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in California: 'Titan's northern lakes region is one
of the most Earth-like and intriguing in the solar system.

'We know lakes here change with the 
seasons. Now that the sun is shining 
in the north and we have these wonderful views, we can begin to compare 
the different data sets and tease out what Titan's lakes are doing near 
the north pole.'

Jia-Rui
Cook, from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory added in a blog post: 'The 
exploration of this amazing place is just beginning. Frigid and alien, 
yet also remarkably similar to our own planet, Titan is a new world - 
revealed before our very eyes by the Cassini and Huygens spacecraft.'
