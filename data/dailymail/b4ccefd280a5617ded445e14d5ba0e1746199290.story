A furious grandfather drove his Jeep into the home of noisy neighbours after becoming fed up with the way they allegedly 'terrorised' his daughter, a court heard.

Paul Kingsman, 52, ploughed into the council house in Peterborough, yelling: 'That's how you bang on a f***ing wall', it was alleged.

The grandfather reportedly banged on windows at Charlene Vernall's home, warning her she had three minutes to vacate before reversing his 4x4 vehicle though the house's front wall.

Paul Kinsgman drove his Jeep into Charlene Vernall's house after his daughter complained the woman was making too much noise

He pleaded guilty to affray, criminal damage and dangerous driving but not guilty to agtravated damage reckless to endanger life.

Peterborough Crown Court heard how the man drove himself home after the incident in Tansor Garth, Peterborough.

A reported £14,000 worth of damage was caused to the house which now has a gaping hole in it.

The court heard how Miss Vernall reported Mr Kingsman's daughter, Sophie, to the RSPCA after allegedly leaving her unfed dog in the snow.

She then allegedly held parties until 5am which kept Sophie and her son awake all night.

Speaking in court, the 23-year-old said: 'It was so loud I couldn’t watch TV and my stairs were shaking. It used 
to keep my baby son awake all night.

'Often it went on until 5 in the 
morning and I could hear the children next door crying too.

'They used to kick my fence late at night. Once they started sort of roaring, like lions, through my walls.

'I
 could hear men threatening to come round and punch me in the face. I 
could hear people saying they needed to go and get weapons.

Paul Kingsman (left) said he didn't plan on destroying the house's wall and that he warned the occupants to get out before ramming his vehicle into it to stick up for his daughter Sophie (right)

Mr Kingsman said he responded in the way he did as he claimed police did not answer his daughter's pleas for help

'I was always frightened.'

The young mother said she reported her neighbour's behavior to the police and her housing association but claimed nothing was done to solve the problem. 

On the day in question, Sophie phoned her father while he was out shopping to tell him she was still having problems with Miss Vernall who is pregnant with her fourth child.

'I took the view no one else was going to stop it. I thought if I damage that property no one could live there,' he said.

‘I
 lined my car up, drove through the fence and stopped. I got out and 
banged the door and the window and was shouting “You’ve got three 
minutes to get out”.

'Then I rammed the house in. When I got out I shouted: “That’s how you bang on a f***ing wall.”'

The 52-year-old said he thought the family would be forced out of the property if he made it unstable, but insisted he had not meant to destroy it completely.

Charlene Vernall, 24, lives at the property with her children. Speaking after Mr Kingsman's trial, she said she would have been quieter if the man had asked

Sophie’s older sister Sarah Kingsman, 25, was in her sister’s house picking up her things at the time of the incident.

She described how she heard screaming, and looked out to see three terrified girls climbing out the back kitchen window.

'We are a close family. I asked him “What have you done?"' she said.

“He said: "They can’t hurt her anymore."

Mr Kingsman allegedly told his daughter he 'couldn't let them do it anymore,' and that the police had ignored her pleas for help.

When offivers arrived at his house that afternoon, they found his car bonnet was crushed in with bits of brick and broken glass hanging off, the court heard.

On his way to the police station, the grandfather allegedly said: 'I would have done it with a club hammer - but that would have taken longer.'

Speaking after the trial, Miss Verball said: 'I was in my front room watching Jeremy Kyle with a cup of tea and a fag.

'Then this guy started banging on my door shouting: “Come on out here or I’m coming in!’

'Then we heard a car revving outside - and the next thing I knew there was a Land Rover in my living room.

'All I remember is seeing the sofa following me as I ran away and all the bricks falling down.

'I don’t think that guy can be normal. If he’d knocked on the door and shouted at me I might have quietened down a bit.'

Kingsman is due to be sentenced at Peterborough Crown Court on February 6.
