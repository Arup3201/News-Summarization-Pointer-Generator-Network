Two men have died and nine are injured after inhaling toxic gases in the engine room of the Pacific Princess, made famous in the 1970s and 80s in the TV series The Love Boat.

Dogan Balci, 37, and Davut Özdemir, 40, were part of a crew of workers dismantling the ship for parts on Saturday in Aliağa, Turkey, after it was sold to Izmir Ship Recycling at auction recently.

The ship had sailed from Genoa, Italy, and encountered rough seas during the voyage, which caused damage in the engine room, according to Turkish media reports.

Pumps being used to drain the engine room of water by workers emitted toxic gas and smoke and workers in the room were poisoned.

The English language paper Today's Zaman reported that Balci and Özdemir complained of feeling unwell but were 'given a yogurt drink by their employer instead of being taken to a hospital.'

Balcı and Özdemir died shortly after, while nine other workers were hospitalized.

The 42-year-old vessel, one of the original ships used in the opening credits of The Love Boat, had been sold for scrap for $3.5 million after languishing in a dock in Genoa for several years. 

Sad end: Two workers died from inhaling toxic gas in the Pacific Princess's engine room

Inspiration: The Love Boat was immensely popular and increased the sales of cruise tickets in the U.S.

It last sailed for Spanish company Quail cruises in 2008, which decided to scrap the ship when repair work proved too costly. 

Footage shows the badly-listing ship limping into the Turkish harbor at Aliağa at the end of her final voyage on August 6.

The tragic death of the workers disassembling the boat is a sad end for the once-great cruise ship - though its twin, formerly called the Island Princess, still sails as MV Discovery.

According to the Hurriyet Daily News, an investigation on what caused the leak will be carried out when all of the water and toxic gas is removed from the ship.
