A man who streamed live football matches through his computer and charged thousands of people to watch it avoided a prison sentence today.

Gary Goodger was only 16 when he started illegally streaming Premier League matches to a website he set up, and undercutting prices charged by official broadcaster, Sky.

He used a huge satellite dish, seven computers and nine satellite decoders to run the 'freelivefooty' website from his home in Lower Earley, near Reading.

Reading Crown Court: Judge John Reddihough gave Gary Goodger, now 24, a suspended prison sentence

Thousands of viewers worldwide were believed to have tuned in to the illegal website, paying through a PayPay online account set up by an accomplice.

Today, in a court case described by copyright enforcers as 'groundbreaking', Goodger, who is now 24, was convicted of his illegal soccer streaming and given a suspended prison sentence.

Sitting at Reading Crown Court, Judge John Reddihough heard that prosecutors were unable to establish how much financial damage the operation caused the broadcaster.

His accomplice, Jack Bannister, allowed his Paypal account to be used by Goodger to process some of the money the enterprise brought in.

Both Bannister and Goodger, who met for the first time at court, were convicted by a jury after a trial.

Judge Reddihough told Goodger: 'Companies in this country, such as the broadcasters in this, and the Premier League, are entitled to their copyright and entitled not to have other people using it illegally, as you did.

'The trouble is that ultimately in cases like this it will be the consumer that ends up paying because if there are less people using it then the prices have to go up.

'The fact, I'm told, that there are a number of other websites and enterprises conducting the same illegal operations, does not help you.

'If anything it calls for the courts to impose deterrent sentences.'

The Federation Against Copyright Theft (FACT) launched an investigation on behalf of the Premier League and supplied evidence to the Thames Valley Police Economic Crime Unit, who arrested Goodger and Bannister in November 2010.

 'This is a ground-breaking case, proving conclusively that operating a website that rebroadcasts copyrighted works without permission is a criminal offence.'

They sent a number of 'cease and desist' notices to the website on behalf of the Premier League but Goodger's activities continued.

Investigations showed that Bannister had processed the money through his PayPal account, and both men were subsequently charged on June 27 2011.

At the end of a six-day trial Goodger was convicted of communicating a copyrighted work to the public in the course of a business.

Bannister, 23, of Burnley, Lancashire, was convicted of transferring criminal property.

Kieron Sharp, FACT Director General, said: 'This is a groundbreaking case, proving conclusively that operating a website that rebroadcasts copyrighted works without permission is a criminal offence.'

Detective Constable Lisa Child, from Thames Valley Police's Economic Crime Unit, said: 'Goodger is believed to have made tens of thousands of pounds through illegally streaming football matches to subscribers to his website, although no exact figure is available due to the complexity of the investigation.'

Alexander Stein, defending Goodger, said in mitigation: 'It is very difficult to know if people would have subscribed to Sky rather than freelivefooty.com but at the time of these offences Sky was not available online anyway.

'I accept they could have subscribed to Sky on the television.'

He said his client's service had also streamed matches that were not available on Sky, adding: 'So it is difficult to know if Sky lost anything.'

Mr Stein went on: 'This website started in 2005 when he was only 16 and even when he was arrested he was only 20 years old.

'He is a young man and he has acted naively and that is how he should be treated.'

He said Goodger was currently working as a mechanic.

Guy Mathieson, defending Bannister, told the judge: 'He had nothing to do with the computing, the streaming, the running of the website, the setting up of the website, the administration of the website.

'He only became involved in November 2009 and his PayPal account was stopped in August 2010 and the website continued with subscriptions.

'So it was running long before he got involved and was running after he stopped.'

He said his client had not tried to hide his identity but had allowed his account, his girlfriend's and his father's accounts to be used despite suspecting that something was not right.

'I bear in mind you were only 16 years old when you started this enterprise and are still relatively young.'

Some £26,000 passed through his account although he was only left with around £3,000, from which various bills also had to be paid.

When Mr Mathieson told the judge that the latest Sky worldwide football rights package had been sold for £5.6bn, meaning his client's actions had little impact, the judge replied: 'I'm not sure that's a good argument because if other people are doing it, a deterrent sentence should be imposed.'

The judge told Goodger: 'I bear in mind you were only 16 years old when you started this enterprise and are still relatively young.

'I have no doubt at all that you were soon aware that what you were doing was illegal and ignored correspondence that pointed out to you that what you were doing was illegal.

You carried on and you made not vast profits but some significant gain.'

He passed a six-month jail term, suspended for two years, and ordered him to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work and pay £1,750 towards the prosecution costs.

He also ordered that all of the equipment used to run the website be forfeited.

The judge then told Bannister: 'I do accept that your role was very subsidiary but you did allow your PayPal account to be used for subscribers to make payments.

'Despite your suspicions you continued to provide the account to be used for it and a considerable amount of money did pass through it, from which you were paid some relatively small amount.'

He ordered Bannister to carry out 140 hours of unpaid work and pay £500 pounds towards the prosecution costs.
