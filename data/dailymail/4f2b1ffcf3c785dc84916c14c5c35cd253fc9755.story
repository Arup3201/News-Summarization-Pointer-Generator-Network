Francois Hollande has been warned that high taxes are holding the French economy back as output flat-lines in 2014

France was last night told high taxes are holding back the recovery after the economy ground to a halt.

Official statistics agency Eurostat said output in France stagnated between January and March following just one quarter of growth at the end of last year.

The bleak figures came as the International Monetary Fund warned that tax rises have ‘weighed on the capacity of the economy to grow’.

In its annual health check on the French economy, the global watchdog said ‘very large’ cuts to public spending are required to put the country’s finances back on a stable footing.

The damning assessment came just a week after Socialist President Francois Hollande claimed that the economy is ‘turning’.

Dominique Barbet, an analyst at French banking giant BNP Paribas, said: ‘France is trailing the rest of Europe.’

French public spending is among the highest in the world and due to hit 57 per cent of national output this year.

The six million State workers make up one fifth of France’s total employed ranks and their salaries account for a quarter of public spending.

But they take an average of nearly a month off beyond annual leave – more than twice the rate in the private sector.

Wage freezes in the public sector and the threat of job losses have provoked a wave of protests around the country and Mr Hollande has the lowest approval rating of any French President on record.

His Socialist party faces defeat at the hands of Marine Le Pen’s far right National Front in next week’s European elections amid widespread voter apathy and a backlash against the mainstream parties.

Mr Hollande’s popularity has been hammered by his failure to keep an election pledge to bring down unemployment and revive Europe’s second largest economy.

Unemployment in France is still above 10 per cent with more than three million people out of work including nearly a quarter of under 25s.

Stagnation in the first three months of the year contrasts with growth of 0.8 per cent in both Britain and Germany.

The Spanish economy grew by 0.4 per cent but output sank 1.4 per cent in the Netherlands, 0.7 per cent in Portugal and 0.1 per cent in Italy.

‘The French economy was dogged by ongoing weakness of consumer spending and business investment, revealing a sustained lack of confidence in the country’s economic outlook,’ said Chris Williamson, chief economist at research group Markit.

The IMF, which is run by former French finance minister Christine Lagarde, said the French national debt has ballooned following ‘decades’ of excessive public spending.

It said the attempt to plug the gap by raising taxes ‘has reached its limits’ and called for spending cuts and economic reforms to pick up the baton.

The Washington-based Fund said it is ‘critical’ that the government shores up its finances so it has the money to ‘respond more flexibly in the face of future shocks’.

And in a chilling warning over the crisis facing French youngsters, it added: ‘Cutting spending has become critical to help put social safety nets on a sound footing for future generations.’

Mr Hollande hiked taxes when he came to power in 2012 having vigorously campaigned against austerity across Europe.

IMF president Christine Lagarde said decades of of excessive public spending has bloated France's debt and said the government had to stop raising taxes to pay for it

But earlier this year he was forced to lower taxes and outline plans to cut €50billion (£41billion) of public spending in a desperate effort to revive the economy and eliminate the deficit.

The IMF yesterday said the new course of tax and spending policy ‘was appropriate’ but said it will be ‘very challenging’ and result in cuts that were ‘remarkable by historical standards’.

‘The planned reductions in taxes mean that the cutbacks to spending will need to be very large if public finances are to be brought back to balance over the medium term as they should,’ it said.

The Fund also warned that the ‘recovery in economic activity is likely to remain subdued’ in France with growth of just 1 per cent this year and 1.5 per cent next year. But independent economists think it will struggle to even reach this.

By contrats the IMF is expecting growth of 2.9 per cent and 2.5 per cent in Britain and 1.7 per cent and 1.6 per cent in Germany.

It said the ‘major risks’ in France are that the government fails to deliver on its pledge and instead resorts to cuts to investment, higher taxes or more debt.
