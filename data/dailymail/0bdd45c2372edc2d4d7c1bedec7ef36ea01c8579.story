Comedian Adam Hills has raised over $90,000 for Robin William's favourite children's hospital after his public spat with a controversial American church group.

Instead of giving money to Westboro Baptist Church to fly them 'first class' to Iraq to picket extreme Islamists - like he had joked - he donated the cash to the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.

And he has urged his fans to do the same. 'Not only will it help a child, it will really piss of a bigot,' he said.

The Australian funny man declared his feud with Westboro Baptist Church over in a segment of his The Last Leg comedy show on Channel 4 in the UK this weekend.

Hills has been in an ongoing Twitter battle with the church after they claimed 'Robin Williams was in hell' for staring as a gay character in various films and supporting US troops.

'God hates signs': Adam Hills has poked fun at Westboro Baptist Church again but said their war of words is over

Comedian Adam Hills said he is still receiving abuse from people despite donating money to a good cause

The threat, made by a church leader in a video message, angered Hills who fired a shot at the church on his television show and offered to fly members 'first class' to Iraq to picket extreme Islamists instead.

'We did seriously look into this and took onboard the advice of both the US and UK governments, neither of which were too happy about us sending professional s**t stirrers into a war zone,' Hills said his show on Saturday night.

Westboro Baptist Church seemed enthusiastic about the idea of going to the Middle East. They tweeted Hills saying: 'Cough up the tickets funny man, we got our bags packed. Iraq needs some preaching.'

'These guys are so desperate for attention they make Lady Gaga look like Salman Rushdie.' Hills joked.

The Australian comedian said he wants to spread 'love not hate'

The Westboro Baptist Church said Hills should provide their plane tickets to Iraq or be quiet

Instead of giving the church the publicity they wanted Hills said he is going to 'fight hate with love'.

His Crowd Rise fundraising page, set up by charity Planting Peace, says: 'Our neighbors at the Westboro Baptist Church have announced their intention to protest the funeral of Robin Williams.

'In keeping with our philosophy of addressing acts of hate and intolerance with compassion and love, we are inviting the public to show their respect and support of a man who spent his life making others smile, who was always there for others in their time of need, and who supported the greater good through works of service and charity.

'Please join Planting Peace in counteracting the WBC’s message of hate through a fundraising event benefiting St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, a cause Mr. Williams passionately and publicly supported.'

In response to Hills rant, the Westboro Church claimed it had picketed in Iraq before

In his rant last week Hills offered to 'personally pay for every member of the Westboro Baptist Church to fly to Iraq right now.'

'If you really believe in standing up to those threatening the Christian way of life, Westboro Baptist Church, how about putting your money where your mouth is, taking a direct flight to Iraq and picketing the people threatening to behead Christians if they don’t convert?'

Hills said there was one or two things he believed would happen to church members in Iraq, if they chose to fly.

'Either you’ll die while defending your beliefs and you’ll be carried away to heaven by a gold chariot to sit at the right hand of God for all eternity.'

'OR if I’m right, and I’m willing to bet a dozen first class flights that I am, God will be standing at the pearly gates alongside a 5ft 8 hairy American comedian dressed as a middle aged Scottish nanny saying, ‘Heeeellllooooo’.

The offer was willingly accepted by the church who then tweeted 'show us the plane tickets!'.  It has now left the door wide open for a highly anticipated response from Hills which he is set to deliver on the next episode of his show.

Hills said he will 'reply' to the Westboro Church, which has already claimed to have picketed in Iraq in the past.

The Group told Adam Hills to show them plane tickets or 'hush' on the topic of picketing Robin Williams funeral

The Westboro Baptist Church (WBC) is an American unaffiliated Baptist church known for its extreme ideologies, especially those against gay people.

The Kansas-based group said Williams spent his life 'mocking God and promoting sin' and 'pushing flagrant debauchery, and hedonism.'

The 63-year-old played an openly gay character in the film The Birdcage, one of many gay characters he portrayed.

The Westboro Baptist Church member’s failed to show up to Williams’ memorial service, which was held in San Francisco on Tuesday, but they did respond to Hills on Twitter, saying, 'Iraq here we come.'
