Heartbreaking video shows a bride in her dress witnessing the fight that would end with an off-duty cop shooting her husband dead on their wedding night.

Anthony Bruno, a 26-year-old Kansas City firefighter died last December 1 after getting into a fight with a cab driver, outside the hotel where he planned to spend his wedding night.

Now his wife Stephanie Bruno, 29, and parents are suring the off-duty cop that killed Bruno and the hotel for wrongful death.

Ripped apart: Bride Stephanie Bruno, 29, is pictured watching her husband get into a fight on their wedding night. That fight would end with the death of Mr Bruno, who was shot while trying to be subdued by an off duty cop

Tragic: It was supposed to be the happiest day of her life, but Stephanie Bruno's wedding night ended in tears when her husband was shot dead. The beginning of the fight seen above

The Brunos were married on November 30 in a ceremony at the Town Pavillion.

The couple later joined a smaller group of family and friends at Anthony's restaurant before getting a cab to the Marriott Muehlebach where they planned to spend the night.

However, the couple got into a fight with the cab driver over a $6 fare which turned violent when the cab driver, Ahmed Alomari, hurled a sexual slur at the new Mrs Bruno.

Stephanie Bruno told investigaotrs that her husband started punching Alomari after the insult, and the resulting fight was caught on hotel surveillance camera.

Police officer Donald Hubbard, 42, who was working as a security officer while off duty at the Marriott, was called to intervene.

Lawsuit: Now Mrs Bruno is suing the off-duty police officer who killed her husband (pictured above), saying he should not have pursued him since he wasn't acting as a cop at the time

Another video shows the Hubbard trying to tame an intoxicated Bruno, who continues to beat back at the officer.

Events quickly spiral out of control when the officer appears to knee Bruno in the head as he tries to cuff him.

This causes Bruno to become enraged and he actively appears to want to overcome the officer, rather than resist arrest.

Hubbard is seen looking at the two 
by-standers and mentioning the word 'help' before Bruno climbs on top of
 him, begins to gouge his eye and mouth and then start to pummel his 
dead.

Not prepared: The suit argues that Hubbard should have been carrying other police gear such as pepper spray or a baton to subdue Bruno

Fighting back: Separate footage shows Bruno overtaking the officer before he was shot

'Hey, don't fight the 
cop, don't fight the cop!' one of the onlookers shouts, right before the
 camera's view slips away and two gunshots ring out.

'He
 was on top of me and I was in an extremely vulnerable position, and I 
was exhausted from the struggle with the suspect,' Hubbard told 
investigators later, in the documents obtained by the Star.

'I
 donâ€™t know how many times he struck me, but I started to black out and 
saw lines across my eyes. He continued to strike me and I started to 
lose consciousness, and I believed the suspect was not going to stop 
hitting me until he killed me. I feared for my life and I drew my 
weapon, fired two shots center mass.'

Bruno was struck both times and pronounced dead at a local hospital.

A grand jury decided not to bring up criminal charges against Hubbard.

But
 Brunos family filed a wrongsful death lawsuit this week, against 
Hubbard, Marriott International and the Kansas City Downtown Hotel Group
 LLC.

In the suit, the 
family argues that Hubbard shouldn't have pursued Bruno since he was not
 working as a police officer at the time and did not witness the 
original fight.

It also says
 he wasn't carrying pieces of police gear such as a radio, stun gun, or 
pepper spray which could have been used to subdue Bruno.
