A grieving widower has blasted phone company EE after they charged him £62 to cancel his wife's £5-a-month phone, just weeks after she died of cancer.

Terry Conway, 73, from Clifton in Nottingham, was left heartbroken when wife Pauline died aged 74 on November 27, after a short battle with lung cancer.

The great-grandfather-of-four decided to wait until the new year to sort out the financial affairs of his wife of 52 years, and contacted the phone company last week.

Terry Conway has blasted the mobile network EE for telling him he needed to pay £62 to end his dead wife's £5-a-month phone, just weeks after she died of cancer

But he was left shocked when two different call handlers both demanded he pay £62 to end the contract - despite it only costing £5.49-a-month.

Mr Conway and his family are now boycotting the firm and have refused to pay any further charges.

Problems arose because although the phone was Mrs Conway's, the account was in her husband's name.

Mrs Conway's phone was a 16-year-old Nokia 3210 and Mr Conway paid EE £5.49-a-month for a SIM-only deal.

It included 500 minutes, 500 text and 250mb of data every month.

Mr Conway, a former HGV driver said: 'When Pauline passed it was very sudden. She had been diagnosed with cancer months before but when her time came it was all over very quickly.

EE have agreed to close the account without the cancellation fee being paid as a 'gesture of goodwill'

'I was in bits, so I decided to leave sorting out her affairs until after the new year and the funeral.

'So I set about sorting everything out last week, I had heard of people having some problems with the government groups like the DWP before, but they were as good as gold and sorted it out.

'So I called EE and explained my wife had died and I would not be using the phone. 

'I said it would be switched off the moment I finished the call and never turned on again.

'So I couldn't believe it when the very nice man on the line said 'fine, that will be £62'.

'I explained again that my wife had died and couldn't use the phone, so he transferred me to another person, a lovely girl, who again told me I needed to pay the money.

'It was only a sim contract, just a little one. My wife never wanted a fancy phone or anything, so just took out a year-long contract.

'She used to be on pay-as-you-go but when she was diagnosed she knew she would be in and out of hospital and wanted the phone to make the odd call and mainly send texts.

'It was barely ever used, and won't be now so I just wanted to end it.

'Now I will be ending my own contract with them when it finishes, as will my family and a lot of my friends. We're all disgusted.

'I'm having to get on with life without Pauline, which is hard enough without added needless stresses.

'I had to use her phone to make these calls, how do they think that made me feel.

'She was such a lovely woman, the church was amazed by how many people turned up at her funeral to pay their respects.

'She used to volunteer, especially after she retired from Sainsbury's and I was still driving the HGV.

Mr Conway has blasted EE for their 'lack of compassion' billing him just weeks after his wife's death

'The account was in my name, but I didn't use it. You would think people would have some compassion.'

Mr Conway's daughter Lynne Conway, 50, added: 'Since mum passed away, dad has been heartbroken. They were together for 55 years and married for 52.

'Cancelling the phone contract was hard enough for him because he gets upset talking about mum, so he was very upset when they told him it would cost him £62.

'I don't think it's right they should be charging him that - it's not his fault that he had to cancel the contract.

'If he had been cancelling it to change networks then fair enough, but he was doing it because somebody died.'

EE have agreed to close the account without the cancellation fee being paid.

A spokesman said: 'We of course close accounts without any cancellation fees if a customer has passed away.

'In this instance, the account was in the husband's name, and given this exceptional circumstance we have closed the account and waived the balance as gesture of goodwill.'
