Sir John Major has claimed Ukip is 'profoundly un-British in every way' just days before the party looks set to beat his in a crucial by-election.

The former Conservative Prime Minister blasted the 'sheer nastiness' of Nigel Farage's party and said it was 'anti-everything... anti-politics, anti-foreigner, anti-immigrant, anti-aid'.

Several polls suggest Mark Reckless will become Ukip's second MP after Thursday's Rochester and Strood poll, which was triggered when he defected from the Tories.

Attack: Former PM Sir John Major blasted Ukip for being 'anti-politics, anti-foreigner, anti-immigrant, anti-aid'

Sir John said: 'I don't know what they are for, we know what they are against. That's not the way to get into Parliament and not the way to run a country... So they may be elected because people are frustrated'

A victory would be an echo of fellow defector Douglas Carswell, who won Clacton in Essex in a landslide for his new party last month.

Sir John told the BBC's Andrew Marr show: 'I think many of the people who are voting for them are doing so out of frustration at the ongoing difficulties of the recession, the belief that they are losing out and falling behind.

'That will fade away as the economy improves, and it is materially improving.'

In his strongly-worded attack he added: 'The policies of Ukip, the direction of Ukip, is, it seems to me, profoundly un-British in every way.

'They are anti-everything. They are anti-politics, they are anti-foreigner, they are anti-immigrant, they are anti-aid.

Confident: Nigel Farage supporting his candidate, who looks set to win, at Rochester's Guildhall last week

'I don't know what they are for, we know what they are against. That's the negativity of the four-ale bar, that's not the way to get into Parliament and not the way to run a country.

'So they may be elected because people are frustrated.' 

Sir John highlighted the Ebola appeal and Children in Need, adding: 'What a counterpoint that is to the negativity and sheer nastiness of much of what Ukip stands for.'

Appeal: Grant Shapps told Sky News today the EU was 'too big, too bossy, too interfering'

Today Mr Farage told The Sunday Telegraph he was 'confident but not complacent' that Mr Reckless would win, partly on the back of a collapse in the Labour vote in the seat. 

'We are smashing the Labour vote to pieces,' he said. 'This is not a straight fight between Ukip and the Tories'.

A Lord Ashcroft poll last week Labour in third on 17 per cent, with Ukip on 44 per cent and the Conservatives trailing far behind them on 32 per cent.

David Cameron has warned that a Ukip win would put the country at greater risk of 'insecurity and instability in our economy'.

The Prime Minister warned voters in the Kent constituency that they risk becoming another notch on the bedpost of Mr Farage's party, who would celebrate victory with 'a pint in the pub'.

He would not represent the area as well as locally-born Tory candidate Kelly Tolhurst, Mr Cameron added.

Despite Sir John's comments, Tory chairman Grant Shapps made another appeal to Eurosceptic voters today as he said the EU was 'too bossy'.

He acknowledged the Tories had 'a problem' with hitting their target of reducing net migration to the tens of thousands by the end of the parliament, partly because of EU migrants attracted by the relative strength of the British economy.

He told Sky News: 'David Cameron, absolutely rightly, is saying on behalf of the British people we don't think this is an open-ended deal, we believe that we should have some control over people coming here.

'People can come here to work, yes, but not to claim benefits.'

He added: 'Most people in this country think Europe is too big, too bossy, too interfering.'
