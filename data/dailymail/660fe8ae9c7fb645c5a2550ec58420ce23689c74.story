She was indicted this week by a grand jury on charges of engaging in sexual intercourse, 'deviate' sexual intercourse and sexual contact by 'forcible compulsion' with a member of the opposite sex between the ages of 12 and 16.

Ferguson was arrested on Wednesday, July 3, Lt. Andy Norris with the Tuscaloosa Sheriffâ€™s Department said.

Mail Online spoke to Lt. Andy Norris, but he is unable to confirm whether it was Mrs Ferguson's husband who tipped off police.

She was suspended from her job in December 2012 after the allegations were first investigated.

Norris said the incidents did not involve any students with the school system.

As for the charge of incest, the documents describe the act as sexual intercourse with a victim who the defendant knew to be related, either by blood, adoption or marriage.

Ferguson was booked into jail and received a $25,000 bond. Her arraignment hearing is scheduled for September 6.

Ferguson is reported to have relatives living in the Geneva and Enterprise area.

She refused to comment to local TV station WVUA without her lawyer present.
