The family of Akai Gurley - the unarmed black man shot dead by a rookie police officer in a darkened New York public housing stairwell - have warned Rev Al Sharpton to stop meddling in their affairs as they prepare to bury their son and father this weekend.

Gurley’s aunt, Hertencia Petersen - speaking on behalf of the man's mother, Sylvia Palmer - said the outspoken civil rights activist has been nothing but opportunistic over Gurley's death, seeing it as a political play when his family just want to lay him to rest.

Sharpton reportedly implanted himself into the planned memorial and funeral service this weekend without properly speaking with Gurley's parents.

'It’s been a nightmare,' Mrs Petersen told The New York Post.

'He just wants to take credit for this when he’s never even contacted my sister (Gurley’s mother).

'Who made you the spokesperson of our family? We just want to bury our nephew with dignity and respect.'

Mrs Petersen further told TMZ: '(All Shapton sees) is money and political gain and that he is turning the tragedy into a circus.'

Sharpton claims he was asked to speak at Gurley's memorial in Brooklyn on Friday night by Kimberly Ballinger, the shooting victim’s domestic partner and mother of his two-year-old daughter.

However he pulled out of the service, citing 'confusion'.

Sharpton then told TMZ he questions the motives of Mrs Petersen.

'I do not know that this Aunt has legal standing to speak for the family,' he told the website.

'When Kimberly asked us for help we responded because she had legal standing as his domestic partner and the mother of his child ... who is the next of kin.' 

Sharpton was set to read a euology, which his family disagreed with because he had never met Gurley.

The memorial otherwise went ahead as planned on Friday, just hours after the Brooklyn district attorney announced plans to take Gurley's case to a grand jury.

Gurley has become part of a narrative of anguish over police use of deadly force, with his wake coming amid protests over the lack of criminal charges against white police officers in the recent deaths of unarmed black men in New York City and Ferguson, Missouri.

'We know because of the circumstances that brought about Akai's death, the entire world family is watching,' the city's elected public advocate, Letitia James, told the gathering.

State Assemblyman Walter Mosley told the hundreds of mourners that 'regardless of what's going on in the world, in the nation, we need to say, `Peace be still.' The day of atonement and judgment will come another day.'

A stream of mourners lined a Brooklyn street as Gurley's casket was brought into a church. 'He was an American!' mourner Selina Forfort exclaimed.

Officer Peter Liang was patrolling a pitch-dark stairwell by flashlight, his gun drawn, when the 28-year-old Gurley and his girlfriend opened a door into the stairway Nov. 20, police said. Liang fired without a word and apparently by accident, police said. Police Commissioner William Bratton has said Gurley was 'totally innocent.'

The wake came two days after a grand jury on Staten Island decided criminal charges weren't warranted against a different police officer in the chokehold death of another unarmed man, Eric Garner. 

Last week, a Missouri grand jury decided not to indict a police officer in the fatal shooting of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown. 

The cases have sparked debate around the country about the grand jury process.

Brooklyn DA Kenneth Thompson said Friday he would convene a grand jury 'because it is important to get to the bottom of what happened,' pledging 'a full and fair investigation.' 

He was 'always a faithful, faithful person,' his stepfather, Kenneth Palmer, told mourners Friday.

'When you hear laughter, that's Akai,' he said.

'When you see a smile, that's Akai ... Let us not forget.'
