California lawmakers think they have an answer to the problem of toy guns looking real – make them only in bright colors.

The proposal is called the ‘Imitation Firearm Safety Act’ and is currently making the rounds in the state senate. It is a direct response to a spate of recent incidents involving police shooting children with toys that look like assault rifles.

The most recent incident involved Andy Lopez, 13, was shot dead Oct 22 by Santa Rosa Police while carrying a toy gun officers determined was a threat.

This can't keep happening: California state senator Noreen Evans (D-Santa Rosa) speaks during a Friday news conference announcing the bill

‘If officers would have seen a gun painted in pink, purple or orange, Andy might still be alive,’ State Senator Noreen Evans said in a statement announcing the bill.

‘This was a huge tragedy for our entire community.’

Tragic death:  Andy Lopez, 13. was shot dead by police in Santa Rosa, California, mistaking his BB gun for an AK-47

The teen’s BB gun would have fallen under the guidelines established by the new bill, should it be signed into law, and would have been a neon color instead of the dark brown that threw officers off.

‘Unfortunately, because of the strong resemblance to firearms, when officers must make split-second decisions on whether or not to use deadly force to protect the public,’ the statement continued.

‘These replica guns can trigger tragic consequences.’

Critics of similar regulations passed in other big cities have said bad guys will just paint their guns bright colors, NBC Los Angeles pointed out.

‘That is just a red herring,’ Ms Evans told the station.

The State Senator cited a 1990 Department of Justice study showing more than 200 incidences of toy guns being mistaken for real guns each year as proof something must be done.

No timetable has been set for when a vote is expected to be taken.
