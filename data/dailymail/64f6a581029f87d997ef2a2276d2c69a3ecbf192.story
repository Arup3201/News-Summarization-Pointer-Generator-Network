Gary Cahill is honoured to have been named England vice-captain by Roy Hodgson as the Chelsea defender eyes another strong season which he hopes will culminate in silverware.

The 28-year-old has been rewarded for his consistency for club and country by being formally named Rooney's deputy and received the armband when the Manchester United forward was substituted in England's recent wins over Norway and Switzerland.

'It's an ambition, but more of a dream, to captain your country,' Cahill said. 'It's still an amazing feeling every time you put on an England shirt to go out to play.

'In the next few years, whether Wayne's rested or injured, there might be an opportunity to captain the team. To know that is unbelievable. To have (the armband) for the short period of time in both games felt really good. It's something I'm really proud of and I'll relish.'

Cahill was speaking ahead of Goalmouth, which airs on Disney XD on Saturday, when he surprised Chelsea fan and competition winner Mark Castiglione, who is 11 and from Walton on Thames.

'He was happily surprised,' Cahill added. 'He was a crazy Chelsea fan and it was a fantastic opportunity for me to do something like that. We had a kick-a-bout in his back garden. It was a fantastic day. I really enjoyed it and I hope he did as well.'

Cahill passed on some of his knowledge and skills. 'Basic ones,' said the central defender, laughing self-mockingly.

Yet the former Aston Villa and Bolton defender showed his skill and value in the Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland in making a crucial block.

It may be a less glamorous skill, but Cahill believes the experience of playing for Chelsea for the last two-and-a-half years, alongside the likes of Ashley Cole and John Terry, have helped his game immensely.

'My reading of the game has improved,' Cahill added. 'It's never over (the line) until it's over. It's a fantastic feeling when something like that happens and you save a goal.'

Cahill and Terry are crucial members of a Chelsea side who are many people's favourites for the Premier League title this season after beginning the campaign with a 100 per cent record ahead of Saturday's match with Swansea.

Cahill added: 'We're confident we've got a good squad, like many other Premier League teams.

'But we're three games in. It's going to be tough.

'We've strengthened the team and we look good. But it's about consistency. Every single time you turn out in the Premier League, no game is easy.'

Losses at Crystal Palace, Aston Villa and to Sunderland cost Chelsea dear last season.

Cahill, who has won the Champions League, Europa League and FA Cup during his time at Stamford Bridge hopes to taste more trophy success, with the Premier League on his wish list.

He said: 'Last year we knew as a group where we slipped up in the league. If we learn from that, we'll do well.

'I'm lucky enough to have won a couple of trophies since I've been here and I'm as hungry as ever to go and try to win some more. We're all fully focused on that and that's our aim.'
