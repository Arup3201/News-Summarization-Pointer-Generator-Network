Change: Teachers who have been convicted of smoking cannabis, using amphetamines or shoplifting will not be banned from the classroom, state rules which have come to light

Teachers convicted of drug offences or theft are to be allowed back into the classroom.

A criminal record for smoking cannabis, using amphetamines or shoplifting need not bar them from continuing their jobs, official guidance states.

Certain gambling, alcohol and driving offences are also not enough to see a teacher removed from their post, the National College for Teaching and Leadership said.

Last night campaigners said routinely allowing such offenders to continue to teach would set a bad example to their pupils.

‘The job of a teacher is not just to impart knowledge to learners, it is to give them moral guidance,’ said David Green, from the Civitas think-tank.

‘You can’t give moral leadership if you yourself don’t set an example.

‘If you’ve been found guilty of the possession of drugs, it implies you at least use them.’

The official guidance from the NCTL has been sanctioned by the Department for Education. It covers when disciplinary panels should issue prohibition orders, which bar teachers whose conduct has fallen below expected standards from working in any classroom.

The guidance tightens the rules in some areas – making it clear that teachers guilty of sexual misconduct and/or any crime involving indecent images of children should be kicked out, as should those convicted of supplying drugs.

But for other drug offences leading to a conviction or caution, teachers should not be prohibited from teaching unless class-A substances – such as heroin, cocaine and ecstasy – are involved, it says.

Offences involving class-B and C drugs, including cannabis and speed, would not mean an automatic prohibition order.

Last night, a Department for Education source said: ‘Obviously, teachers should be strongly disciplined if they have committed theft or used drugs. We are absolutely clear that teachers can be banned for life.

Example: We need teachers to give moral leadership for children, which drug offenders cannot do, critics claim

'Heads are responsible for considering whether a lesser punishment, such as suspension or dismissal, is more appropriate.’

A DfE spokesman said: ‘What is important is keeping children safe. But it is also important that cases are dealt with individually, based on the specific circumstances.

'We have tightened guidelines to make the system tougher than ever.'

The spokesman added: 'It is wrong to say that teachers won't be barred for these offences.'

But Mr Green said: ‘It would not be compatible with a teaching job if someone is found guilty of an offence of drug possession. It would imply that the teacher did not feel there was anything wrong in taking drugs, which hardly sets a good example.’

The same principle applied to theft, he said.

Norman Wells, of the Family Education Trust, said: ‘Although a lifetime ban from teaching would in many cases be too severe a penalty for more minor offences, schools and professional conduct hearing panels cannot afford to turn a blind eye.

‘In order to safeguard the reputation of the teaching profession and to send a clear message to pupils that drug, alcohol and theft offences – no matter how minor – are not to be tolerated, some form of disciplinary action is called for.’

The NCTL guidance says each case needs to be considered on its merits, raising the prospect that teachers convicted of very serious offences could be allowed to continue to teach in some circumstances.

Latest figures show that, in 2012/13, 98 prohibition orders were issued.

Four years ago, an investigation found that dozens of teachers with convictions were being allowed to stay in the classroom. Some guilty of crimes including harassment, battery, assault, indecent exposure, indecent assault and possessing class-A drugs had not been banned.
