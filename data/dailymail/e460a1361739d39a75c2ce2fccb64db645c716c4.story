These kind-hearted divers removed a fishing hook from the jaws of a 6ft silky shark after coaxing it into a natural trance.

Friends Cameron Nimmo, 26, and Mickey Smith, 25, grabbed the fish by the tail and twisted it upside down, paralysing it in a state called tonic immobility.

It is a well-known phenomenon that affects certain shark species, including Great Whites and tiger sharks, and can last for up to 15 minutes.

Just when you thought it was safe: Divers Cameron Nimmo and Mickey Smith, from Florida, make it their mission to remove hooks from the mouths and bodies of the silky sharks they encounter in coastal waters

Success: Mr Nimmo, 26, holds up the hook after removing it from the shark's jaws. Although twisting the animals upside down puts them in a state called tonic immobility, this one quickly awoke and swam away

But when the pair - who nickname themselves Shark Addicts - removed the hook with a pair of pliers, it was enough to stir the animal rapidly back into life as it darted away.

The friends see anywhere from five to 20 sharks on each dive off the coast of Jupiter, Florida, and say three-quarters of them have hooks embedded somewhere in their bodies.

Fishermen often target silky sharks, which are numerous off the southeastern U.S. coast and in the Gulf of Mexico.

But they can also be caught accidentally by people trying to catch other species such as tuna.

Mr Nimmo said: 'It happens when people who are fishing. They catch them and cut the line so they don't have to bring it on the boat, or the shark breaks the line.

Tough job: The pair use pliers to extract the hooks, which they say affect three-quarters of the sharks they see

Technique: The sharks are flipped upside down by holding them gently by the tail and twisting their bodies

Flipped: Once the sharks are the wrong way up, they are paralysed for up to 15 minutes. Scientists disagree over the origins of the phenomenon, which affects several species and can be triggered in different ways

'Taking a hook out feels great, knowing you have helped one of these magnificent creatures makes it all worth it.'

The Shark Addicts said they had made it their mission to remove hooks from the mouths, noses and bodies of every shark they can.

'I love popping the hooks out,' said Mr Nimmo. 'There is some danger there but the last thing I'm thinking about it getting bitten - I just want to get the hook out.

'We love sharks so much and want to be around them as much as possible. We are trying to changes people's perspective on sharks through the videos that Mickey films.

'We want to help protect our oceans and marine life.'

Animal kingdom: The pair love sharks and despite silky sharks growing up to 10ft, they rarely feel in danger

Despite publicity, shark attacks are relatively extremely rare. Mr Nimmo said: 'We are trying to changes people's perspective on sharks through our videos. We want to help protect our oceans and marine life'

The friends hope to turn their passion into a business and teach others about the importance of caring for sharks.

Silky sharks are common near the coasts of the Americas, Australia and West Africa.

They can live for more than 20 years and grow up to 10ft long, and although their size and jaws make them potentially dangerous to humans, attacks are fairly rare.Â
