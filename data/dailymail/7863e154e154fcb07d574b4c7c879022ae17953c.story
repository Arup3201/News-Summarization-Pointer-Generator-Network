An 11-year-old girl was bitten twice by a shark as she played on a boogie board in Daytona Beach.

The Florida schoolgirl was helped to shore by a couple of strangers who were on the beach, and she was rushed to hospital.

As well as having scars on her leg as a constant reminder of the attack, the shark that attacked Florida schoolgirl Riley left behind a small memento - a tooth, 10 News reported.

Survivor: Riley is recovering after being bitten twice by a shark

There have been several reports of shark attacks in the U.S. this summer, including a 20-year-old German tourist who died a week after having her arm bitten off while she holidayed in Hawaii.

Six people were also bitten in one weekend off Daytona Beach two weeks ago, according to the ABC News.

While none of the Florida attacks were serious, they led to an inlet being closed to swimmers and surfers.

George Burgess, director of the International Shark Attack File, said the attacks were caused because surfers and sharks congregate in the same area.

'It's an inlet,' he said, referring to the earlier attacks. 'Schools of fish tend to congregate around the inlet and sharks, of course, are going to be found around schooling fishes.'

Reminder: A baby tooth from the shark, left, was found in in the bite wound on Riley's leg

Riley, who was fortunate enough to be near people who could help get her to safety after the shark attack, which left a bite mark on her lower leg, is now recovering.

Florida shark attacks are more common in areas around Daytona Beach that face the Atlantic. It is a stretch of ocean that is popular with surfers and is also a feeding ground for marine creatures, including bull sharks.
