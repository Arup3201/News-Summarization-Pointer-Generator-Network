England's World Cup team don't even know yet who they'll face in Brazil next summer - but they have been told they won't be getting a good reception.

That's because the nation's stars have been booked in to a 'luxury' hotel that's been panned online and branded 'appalling' and smelly by guests.

The Royal Tulip Hotel in Rio de Janeiro will be England's base for the 2014 World Cup, where Wayne Rooney, Steven Gerrard and co will stay as they prepare for matches.

But guests say the stench from the open drain that carries raw human waste past the front of it is disgusting and have complained about the rear view of Brazil's biggest slum.

The Royal Tulip, which has been heavily criticised in reviews on online travel site TripAdvisor, was previously called the Rio InterContinental.

Then in 2010 a female guest was killed in its foyer when rival drug gangs fought a gun battle there, The Sun reported.

Guests have also complained about the dirt-encrusted patio windows, jammed windows, fittings coated in rust and light sockets being wedged into ceiling holes with tissues.

Its rear apartments look out over the Rochina slum which is home to 70,000 people including some of Brazil's most notorious gangsters.

One reviewer, from Aberdeen, wrote on TripAdvisor: 'I am staying here as I write this 26/10/13 in room 809 and I am appalled 
at the absolutely dirty room they gave me today.

'I could write my name 
in the mirror and it really was appalling, everything was dirty and 
covered in dust, this does not happen overnight so it has not been 
cleaned for a long time or even checked, the 8th floor also smells when 
you enter it due to lack of cleaning.

'I will make sure my company ensures that no one stays in this filthy Royal Tulip again, never mind the English football team!

'Sorry Royal Tulip but you really are the worst hotel I have stayed in for over two 
years, never again.'

'In the room, it still seems the last maintenance was last century. The door locker is waiting to fall, the windows don't close completely... And then, there is the front desk. Probably the worst customer service in the country, and by some margin. Nothing royal - a good hotel for Soviet Union in the 70s.' - VudeSingapour, Singapore

'Everything you have heard about this place is right - if what you heard was horrible. An open sewer outside the place insures that the following is literally true: this hotel stinks...the carpets were so wretched we gave up doing yoga...' - r2croak, New York

'All in all a pretty nerve wrecking place with bad service but expensive in turn. Unfortunately cannot recommend!' - Hook00, Milan

'Huge deception. This hotel has the worst possible internet service! It has been under works for ages and the pool is just big enough to wash a shirt... the terrible joke is that it pretends to have 5*!'  - R O, Lisbon

'Employes (sic) not very caring a little attitude I may say, surrounding area is dangerous, the beach dirty some days, my bathroom water came out black a couple of times, would not recommend' - igr2271, Miami

Another guest, from Danville, Pennsylvania, said: 'I have travelled all over the world. I have never stayed anywhere worse.

'The staff was extremely rude, never helpful. They kept billing us for 
things we never purchased, and when questioned about it, claimed they 
could not help us.

'They recommended a driver that charged about five times a
cab, then failed to pick us up after dropping us off. DO NOT STAY HERE.'

Football Association bosses plan to use Rio as a central base before and between fixtures at the World Cup.

England will find out who they will play and where until the draw for the group stage of the competition on December 6.

An FA spokesman confirmed to The Sun that England will stay at the Royal Tulip and it is believed the hotel will be refurbished in time for the event.

The hotel declined to comment.
