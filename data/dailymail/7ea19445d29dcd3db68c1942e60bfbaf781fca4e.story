There were certainly no hard feelings between the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge today, even though she beat him in two yacht races around Auckland Harbour in New Zealand.

In fact, the body language between the Royal couple shows that their bond is stronger than ever.

After her victory against Prince William, the pair laughed and smiled together, and Kate even offered a look of sympathy as she patted her husband’s arm.

Body language expert Judi James told MailOnline 
the playful competiveness between the Royal couple symbolises the great 
strength of their relationship. 

‘The
 men of the Royal family are often celebrated sporting figures whilst 
their wives sometimes take a slightly more compliant role,’ says James.

‘I
 think William loves the fact that Kate joins in and they can share 
these moments, but also that they have this competitive, playful side to their relationship.

‘It
 shows that, despite being the future King and Queen of England, they 
are actually a rather normal couple, too, who like to joke around with 
each other.

‘It shows that they are a real couple: They can laugh together. They are playmates.’

Furthermore, says James, it's a nod to the incredibly strong yet competitive relationship that Prince William and his brother Prince Harry share.

'William and Harry are famous for having this joke-competitiveness too,' says James.

'The fact William also has that with Kate, I think, makes them even closer and proves that they really are friends as well as husband and wife.'

And the couple's tactile nature is just what will help them get through their busy royal tour as, according to experts, a loving hand from a partner will reassure and help to calm.

‘The more a couple touch, the stronger the connection,’ says love and relationship expert, Tracey Cox.

‘Touch
 is incredibly important because it has a calm, reassuring effect on the
 body. It establishes you as a couple and sends strong mateship guarding
 signals.

‘Touching also allows some bonding hormones to be transmitted through the skin.

‘Kate and Wills are very tactile and there's lots of intense eye contact as well.

‘Their body language is that of a very close and intimately connected couple.’

And it's not just her husband who is treated to Kate's personal touch. She's also been spotted using an almost hypnotic hand gesture as she chats to royal fans.

Her enchanting body language appears 
to help her connect with people and Judi James says her hand gestures 
are a real down to earth, personal touch.

‘Royals need to connect with us,’ she explains.

She's doing alright: Kate gives a big thumbs up as she takes to the seas with William and it's her every day hand gestures that make her such a winner with everyone she meets

‘Kate’s hand gestures are incredibly potent and personal as it brings a connection to anyone she is speaking to.

‘Everyone
 feels individually that that she’s ‘got them’ and that they are 
important. It’s much more intimate than shaking someone’s hand.’

They may be royalty but, like any 
other young couple in love, Kate and William just can't get enough of 
each other. And, even right from the start of their relationship, they 
haven't been afraid to let the whole world see just how much they love 
each other. Take a look back at some of their loved-up moments
