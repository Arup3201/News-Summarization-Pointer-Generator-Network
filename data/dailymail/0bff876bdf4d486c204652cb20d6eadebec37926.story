A Wisconsin court has suspended a former state prosecutor's license to practice for four months after he allegedly sent a domestic abuse victim a series of racy texts as he prosecuted her attacker.

Ken Kratz, who also works as a victims' rights advocate, allegedly made sexual remarks to social workers in actions the state's Supreme Court branded 'appalling'.

'This was exploitative behavior, 
harassing behavior, and a crass placement of his personal interests 
above those of his client, the State of Wisconsin,' the court wrote in a
 collective decision.

He was also ordered to pay $23,904 to cover the costs of the disciplinary proceedings.

Suspended: Kenneth Kratz, pictured in 2007, is not allowed to practice law for four months because of racy texts he sent to domestic abuse victims. He was previously a DA and now works as a defense attorney

Kratz, who now works as a defense attorney didn't immediately return a message left at his office on Friday, but he argued in court filings he didn't deserve a suspension, saying he has suffered enough.

Kratz's 18-year stint as Calumet County district attorney came to an end in 2010 after it emerged that he had sent a barrage of racy text messages to a 25-year-old woman a year earlier.

The attorney, who was married at the time but is now divorced and has filed for bankruptcy, sent the messages to the woman, Stephanie Van Groll, while he was prosecuting her ex-boyfriend.

Kratz, then 50, called Von Groll - who later identified herself in interviews - a 'hot nymph' and advertised himself as 'the prize' with a $350,000 house and a six-figure salary.

Messages: Stephanie Van Groll was stunned when she received the racy texts from the DA

He asked whether she was 'the kind of girl that likes secret contact with an older married elected DA' and told her he wanted her to be 'so hot' and 'treat me so well that you'd be THE woman. R U that good?'

She went to police, who referred the case to the state Department of Justice.

That agency found Kratz hadn't 
committed any crimes but told Kratz he should step aside from the 
domestic abuse prosecution and self-report his conduct to the state 
Office of Lawyer Regulation.

Kratz
 removed himself from the case, reported his behavior to the OLR and 
agreed to resign as chairman of the state Crime Victims' Rights Board. 
OLR decided he acted inappropriately but didn't commit any ethical 
violations and quietly closed his case in March 2010.

An AP story on the case that September set off a firestorm of outrage.

Kratz resigned in October 2010 as then-Gov. Jim Doyle began a little-used process to remove him from office.

As the story emerged, more women came forward and accused him of making sexual remarks/

One
 social worker said he made a comment about oral sex to her before she 
testified in court and later told her he wanted the case to end so he 
could go to Las Vegas and have 'big-boobed' women serve him drinks.

Another social worker said he told her that he thought a court reporter had big breasts.

Moving on: Kratz, who is since divorced but now has a new girlfriend, has shared these photographs on Facebook of his 'new life'. He had argued that the suspension was too strict as he has 'suffered enough'

The OLR reopened its case against him and Kratz ultimately filed a no-contest plea to six misconduct charges.

The agency recommended the Supreme Court suspend his license for six months. A referee found a four-month suspension would be more appropriate, noting Kratz has never tried to justify his behavior, he was abusing prescription drugs and was seeking treatment for a sex addiction.

The Supreme Court agreed with the referee's recommendation.

'The recommended four-month suspension is deserved,' the court wrote. 'In short, whatever his qualities and accomplishments as a lawyer, Attorney Kratz proved himself during the period in question to be sanctionably sophomoric.'

Justices Shirely Abrahamson and David Prosser each wrote separately saying the court should review OLR's practices. Prosser also said Kratz, who has filed for bankruptcy, shouldn't have to pay the 'extravagant' costs of the process. He called the costs 'manifestly unfair.'

Katz's Facebook page indicates he now has a girlfriend.
