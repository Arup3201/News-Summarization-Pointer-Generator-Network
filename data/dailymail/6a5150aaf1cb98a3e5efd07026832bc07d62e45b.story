A six-year-old schoolboy became the surprise star of England's Six Nations clash against Italy after he bellowed God Save the Queen with all his might.

Rugby superfan Harry Westlake's heartfelt performance of the national anthem yesterday was praised by players, fans and chiefs at England Rugby.

His father Kevin, 36, revealed the youngster fell asleep the instant he arrived back at the family home in Plymouth, Devon - but had the day of his life.

The building firm health and safety manager, who lives with Harry, older son Alfie, seven, and wife Nicola, 34, a wedding venue manager, said: 'This is my boy. He is the most passionate person I know. 

'He loves England. He loves rugby. He met his idols - he met Owen Farrell in the stand.

'He sings the national anthem like that regardless of whether he's in a huge stadium or whether he's sat in front of the telly. He even knows the second and third verses.

'We're not overly patriotic as a family, it's just something that he's picked up because of the passion the rugby invokes.

Ambition: Six-year-old Harry says he dreams of becoming a centre or a fly-half for England when he grows up 

'He's not the best player in the world yet but he tries his hardest, he leads by example and I'm incredibly proud of him. 

'I introduced him to rugby in the park when he was three and we went to his first international last year when he was five years old - England against Wales in the Six Nations.' 

Harry now has one dream - to be a centre or a fly-half for England when he grows up.

The six-year-old told MailOnline: 'Those are my favourite players because they're strong and quick.

'I was happy to sing in front of all those people. I was nervous but it was amazing. My favourite player is Owen Farrell and I got to meet him.'

The under-7s player was unruffled by his own performance, adding: 'That's just how I sing normally'.

Pride: Kevin's singing soon won him the attention of fans, player Mike Brown and England bosses on Twitter

The grandson of a former Plymouth Albion captain, Harry won the chance to stand in front of England captain Chris Robshaw yesterday after he wrote 100 words about why he liked rugby.

He was one of two mascots who gave it their all at London's Twickenham Stadium - helping the national side to a thumping 47-17 victory over Italy.

After millions of viewers saw him sing, Harry was quickly praised online by Twitter users with the hashtag #doitlikeharry.

England and Harlequins ace Mike Brown wrote: 'Why I love playing rugby for England! How much of a legend is this little man Harry'.

And the official England Rugby Twitter page said: 'The passion etched on Chris Robshaw's face is echoed on the young mascot's below. It means so much to so many.' 

It was an exhausting experience for Harry, who had to begin the 400-mile round trip at 5.30am yesterday - and only got home at 11.30pm.

But his father said: 'He's still full of energy. He was up and playing a match against Newton Abbot this morning.

'We've shown him some of the reaction but he doesn't grasp the concept of Twitter or Facebook. He's just happy that the players are proud of him.' 

The pupil at St George's Primary School, who plays for Devonport Services RFC under-7s, also met England coach Stuart Lancaster ahead of the team's victory over Wales last weekend.

The previous meeting was set up as a thank you present after a photo of Harry, then five, on his father's shoulders at his first Six Nations match last year was used for publicity by the RFU. 

Mr Westlake, a rugby coach, added: 'Harry was given VIP access on a one-to-one basis with the entire England squad and management.

'He was interviewed for a piece on Sky Sports news and England Rugby TV.'
