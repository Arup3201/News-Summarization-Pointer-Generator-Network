My new best friend has some advice for me. 'Don’t take yourself too seriously,' says Frankie Wales, a pretty 28-year-old dance instructor who has just stepped into my life. 'If you don’t quite understand what I’m doing, keep moving. And let yourself go.'

It’s an order, rather than a request, but it’s delivered so sweetly – a peculiar mixture of authority and concern, like a country policeman who’s just found the local headmaster whose satnav has sent him the wrong way – that I do my best to obey. 

I’m at my very first zumba class – and Frankie is my teacher. I’ve spent the last five years of my life walking past leaflets and posters advertising this fitness craze, and now finally I’ve succumbed.

Fish out of water: Vince, centre, went to his first zumba class - and says he seemed to be going in one direction while everyone else went in the other

I call it a craze. But it’s gone way beyond that. Invented nearly 20 years ago by a Colombian dance choreographer named Alberto Perez, zumba is now practised all over the world. It’s estimated that 140 million people have taken part in zumba  – a dance fitness programme, based around Latin music – in 185 countries.

Yet, here in Britain at least, there are precious few men who do it.

'I don’t know why men come to zumba so rarely,' says Frankie, who has taught just a 'handful' of chaps in the three years she’s been holding regular classes. 'I’m always telling men that it was a bloke who invented it.'

I’m in Uppingham, a beautiful market 
town in the county of Rutland. Glorious sandstone and limestone 
buildings line the streets and market square.   

But I’m cocooned inside a bright, shiny gymnasium – and there’s fast, rhythmic music pounding from the speakers.

Meanwhile,
 Frankie is pointing to her shoulders, pointing to her toes, imploring 
us – gently, kindly – to leap here, clap there, and jump to our left and
 right while waving our arms to the right and the left. (So confusing!).

Getting stuck in: Instructor Frankie, left, told Vincent to let himself go and not to worry if people are watching - and Vince says by the end of the class, he manages just that

My heart is beating, my legs and arms are moving. Just not necessarily in the same direction as Frankie’s.

Put it like this: if she’s Ginger Rogers, I’m Freddie Starr.

But does it matter? Let’s say that, at the start of the class, I haven’t yet made up my mind. So why have I come to this particular zumba class?

Rutland
 is Britain’s smallest county (there are just two towns, and not a 
single city, within it) but it is part of a big, bold challenge.

Earlier
 this month, more than 100 local residents turned up early on a crisp 
winter morning to a public hall in the neighbouring town of Oakham. 
They’d all been invited along to have their blood cholesterol measured. 

If
 their cholesterol was above the government’s recommended level, they 
were asked if they wanted to take part in a community challenge. The 
plan was see whether, working in concert with their friends and 
neighbours, a whole community (or at least a good chunk of it) could 
collectively lower its cholesterol.*

The volunteers agreed to alter their diets – fewer saturated fats, please, and more fruit and vegetables – and exercise more.

They’d also consume products from the 
Flora pro.activ range – which has been shown to lower cholesterol when 
consumed as part of a healthy diet and lifestyle*.

Community spirit: The class was arranged by Flora as part of its initiative to reduce cholesterol among residents of Rutland. 'This is a close-knit part of the world,' says one. 'People pull together'

Then, three weeks after they started, the local residents will have their cholesterol measured again – and see how well they’ve done.

The zumba class attendees here today seem to like the way this health challenge – individuals joining together to achieve a common good – has brought the community closer.

'This is a close-knit part of the world. People pull together,' says 66-year-old former English teacher Margaret Day.

It’s clear local people are taking the challenge seriously. It’s 10am on a Tuesday morning but the people here are not the usual zumba suspects but ordinary folk from all walks of life, in all shapes and sizes. I chat to women in their 40s, 50s and 60s; fit folk who take plenty of exercise anyway to  larger types who are new to zumba.

One by one, the locals have lined up to tell me that it doesn’t matter that I think I can’t dance. So does the chap who’s been sent along by Flora pro.activ to make sure we’ve all got what we need.

And the amazing thing is that a few minutes into the class, I realise the truth: so what if I don’t keep up with every step? My eyes are fixed on Frankie and her instructions. And – crucially – so are everybody else’s.

No one is spending a moment watching my dancing, how I’m getting on. It takes all your concentration to keep your own show on the road. There’s no time to pass judgment on others.

So, I follow Frankie’s advice. If I get a step wrong, I just keep moving. And no one notices apart from me.And soon even I stop caring about that. At the end, I feel hot, sweaty – and like I’ve achieved something.

Frankie says I’ve done jolly well. And even if I don’t believe her, I’ve ended up rather enjoying myself.

How did I allow that to happen?* Flora pro.activ contains plant sterols, which have been shown to lower blood cholesterol: scientific tests demonstrate that consuming 1.5-2.4g of plant sterols per day can lower cholesterol by 7-10% in 2-3 weeks when consumed as part of a healthy diet and lifestyle with sufficient fruit and vegetables.
