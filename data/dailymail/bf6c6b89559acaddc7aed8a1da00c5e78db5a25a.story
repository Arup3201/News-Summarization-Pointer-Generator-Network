Live pipe organ music is evocative of old Hollywood glamour and silent movies, but has long been absent from British cinemas, until now.

The only Wurlitzer organ in a working cinema in Europe has made its debut after a painstaking five-year restoration, much to the delight of cinema goers.

Enthusiasts from across the country descended on the Royalty Cinema in Bowness-on-Windermere, Cumbria, at the weekend to witness a piece of history.

Iconic: The only Wurlitzer organ in a working cinema was lovingly restored in a process that spanned five years

Pride of place: The organ is lit up beside the screen as guests at the opening ceremony enjoyed the silent film Safety Last, accompanied by Mr Ivory on the organ

The organ was originally at a theatre in Ohio but was shipped to the UK in 1934 when ‘talkies’ ended the era of silent films in the USA. It was used occasionally at the Rex cinema in East London until the 1970s.

Mayor of Windermere Allan Winrow cut the ribbon at the weekend to unveil the instrument.

Mark Latimer, who launched the restoration, said: 'At some points I never thought we would get this far, so it’s tremendous to see it playing - it sounds fantastic.

'People have come here from the south coast to Scotland and everywhere in between.'

Visitors were treated to an afternoon concert featuring organists Chris Powell, David Ivory and David Shepherd.

Organs took the place of orchestras in the heyday of silent films, designed to produce many different sounds and timbres using the fewest number of pipes to minimise the space needed.

The restored Wurlitzer has the traditional horse-shoe shaped console and sits in pride of place on the right hand side of the screen at the Royalty cinema.

Nostalgic: Mr Ivory played the same organ over 40 years ago at the East London bingo hall, and said the event in Cumbria had brought back memories for him

Tickling the ivories: David Shepherd entertained guests on the pipe organ that produces a surprising variety of sounds, including that of a siren

Describing the opening event as ‘fantastic’, Alan Adams, of Barrow, said: 'I could have listened to the organ for hours.

'It was so good and it’s wonderful to see the organ being used. I am glad I came.'

The celebration continued with an evening showing of silent film Safety Last, accompanied by Mr Ivory on the organ.

He said being involved brought back some memories for him.

'I played this very same organ 40 years ago so it’s nostalgic for me - I used to play it in an East London bingo hall. I’d entertain the ladies before bingo so it’s nice to be playing it again.'

Piece of history: The performance of David Ivory (pictured) and the other organists, was the first time many of the cinema enthusiasts would have heard the organ live

There were also shorter films to start the cinema evening, which included the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy and Buster Keaton, with Paul Gregson at the keyboard.

One of those chuckling at the comedians, John Simpson, from Lancaster, said: 'This is the first time I have seen a Wurlitzer in action so I was very excited. I’ve heard them on CDs but nothing compares to seeing it live.

'Everyone has been laughing so it must be good, and the organists are so talented.'

Alan Mason, of Barrow, who attended the concert and film show, said: 'The concert was very good and I am surprised at how many people turned up.

'I’ve seen the organ over the years so it’s lovely to come and see it being played, especially in a setting like this because there are not many vintage cinemas about.'
