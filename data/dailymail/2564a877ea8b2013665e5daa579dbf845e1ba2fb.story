Facing charges: Nathaniel Cosby was not originally arrested for the murder of a woman in Hawaii but now he faces a military court hearing stemming from the May murder because he is a Marine

A Marine has been arrested for killing a woman who was visiting Hawaii with her boyfriend and friends to celebrate her birthday.

Nathaniel Lynn Cosby is scheduled to appear at a military court hearing at the Hawaiian Marine Corps base on Wednesday, more than four months after theÂ  woman's body was found.

Ivanice 'Ivy' Harris was found dead on May 20- four days after she disappeared while on a night out in Waikiki with her friends- but the nature of her death has not been disclosed.

A childhood friend confirmed that before her death, Harris was a prostitute in her home city of Portland, Oregon but she planned on leaving the sex trade and enrolling in a local college upon her return from her birthday trip.

Cosby, who The Oregonian reports is a 
Master Sergeant in the Marines and was an explosive ordnance technician,
 was taken into custody on June 5 at Honolulu International Airport.

He
 was brought to the Oahu Community Correctional Center on suspicion of 
second-degree murder but he was never formally charged and was released 
two days later.

Now he is being charged in the military court and they will decide whether he will be court martialed.

The
 Oregonian reports that he stands to face charges of unpremeditated 
murder, manslaughter, murder while engaging in an inherently dangerous 
act, obstruction of justice and patronizing a prostitute.

Victim: Ivanice "Ivy" Harris was a prostitute from Oregon on vacation in Hawaii for her birthday when she was killed in May

Very few details have been released pertaining to the case, except to say that her death was ruled a homicide by the medical examiner's office due to injuries on her neck.

She disappeared after what was supposed to be a night out with her friends to the bar Kelley O'Neil's on Lewers Street in Waikiki.

When they were pulling up in a cab, they saw Harris standing across the street in front of the bar.

They got out of the taxi and looked back across the street only to find that she was gone.

They texted Harris for an hour to meet up but never received an answer back.

Ms.
 Harris was reported missing after she was last seen speaking with a man
 outside the bar in Waikiki just after 2am but it remains unclear if 
that man was Cosby.
