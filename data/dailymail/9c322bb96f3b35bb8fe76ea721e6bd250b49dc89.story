Two more people have died from a gun battle that erupted in broad daylight during a soccer tournament in Wilmington, Delaware, on Sunday, raising the death toll to three.

Spectators Herman Curry, 47, of New Castle, who was shot in the chest, and 16-year-old Alexander Kamara, of Pike Creek, who was shot in the head, both died in hospital of their injuries.

Police identified the suspect, who was killed when spectators returned fire, as Maryland man Sheldon Olge, 43.

Shooter: A fatally wounded suspect was airlifted to a hospital, where he died

The gunman was found in a getaway car with multiple gun shot wounds to the chest minutes after the bloody gun battle.

He was airlifted to Christiana Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.

A third spectator, a 33-year-old 
Baltimore man, was shot in the shoulder and was treated at the same 
hospital, according to Delaware Online.

Two Delaware men, Otis Phillips, 34, of New Castle, and Jeffery Phillips, 22, of Wilmington, have been arrested in connection with the shooting.

Otis Phillips, who was caught by 
officers after a dog bit his leg, was already wanted by police for the 
slaying of Chris Palmer, 40, in 2008. He was charged with first-degree murder for the outstanding killing.

For Sunday's shooting spree, both men 
were charged with two counts of first-degree murder, one count of first 
degree attempted murder, conspiracy and possession of a firearm during 
the commission of a felony.

Afternoon in the park: A gunfight broke out in broad daylight at Eden Park in Wilmington during a soccer match

Captain Nancy Dietz told The News Journal that at around 2.30pm, three men began firing into a crowd at Eden Park during the annual Marcus Garvey Soccer Tournament that was organised by Mr Curry.

Some of the spectators returned fire, killing Olge and shooting Jeffery Phillips in the leg.

The three gunmen fled in a vehicle, but it crashed a few blocks away at New Castle Avenue and C Street.

The other two men took off from the scene on foot, but were later discovered by patrol officers accompanied by a K-9 dog hiding in a nearby vacant lot.

The afternoon shooting came just hours after another person was found shot to death near 13th and French streets.

Police have not yet determined the motive for the soccer match shooting or whether the two incidents are connected.
