David Cameron was facing an English backlash at Westminster last night over the rush to hand Scotland sweeping new powers.

The Prime Minister yesterday confirmed that Scotland would get ‘major new powers over tax, spending and welfare’ if it voted No to independence next week.

Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg are also pledging a major transfer of powers in a last-ditch bid to persuade Scots to keep the UK together.

But the move provoked alarm among English MPs, who last night warned it would be ‘untenable’ for Scotland to be handed new powers without major reform of its voting rights at Westminster and generous funding settlement.

Tory MP John Redwood said England ‘needs a voice’ in any negotiation about the future balance of the Union

Former Tory Cabinet minister John Redwood said ministers now needed to answer the question: ‘Who speaks for England?’

Speaking in the Commons, Mr Redwood said England ‘needs a voice’ in any negotiation about the future balance of the Union.

He later told the Daily Mail that devolved matters such as health, education and local government would have to be reserved for English MPs as part of any new settlement – and said this could even result in the creation of an English government.

He said: ‘I understand why the party leaders are making these offers, but it opens up the whole English issue in a way they have not thought through.

‘This is a very big recasting of the relationship with Scotland and many people feel that what is good enough for Scotland should be good enough for England too.

‘You cannot insult England again by giving it nothing while handing Scotland all these new powers. We cannot go on having 59 Scottish MPs still voting on English education when neither they nor we can vote on Scottish education.

‘How can they be involved in setting income tax levels which their constituents will not pay? It is completely untenable.’

Fellow Tory Christopher Chope reminded MPs that Mr Cameron had refused to allow the so-called ‘devo max’ option he now appears to favour to be put on the referendum ballot paper.

Mr Chope said the UK was ‘on the edge of a precipice’ and warned against trying to rush through a new constitutional deal without consulting English voters.

‘There are a lot of people in England who already feel the Scots get a pretty good deal,’ he said. 

‘You can argue that that is fair enough – under a single currency the more peripheral areas usually get a better deal as part of the arrangements for ensuring a unified country.

‘But I don’t think the English public will take kindly to the idea that devo max is being given to Scotland funded by the rest of the UK as a consolation prize for voting No. It is not tenable to simply hand over more powers to Scotland without a wider debate.

‘Of course the English feel left out – it has never been discussed with them. That cannot go on.’

William Hague told MPs that support for devo max was not yet formal government policy, but it had ‘been the policy of the Government for some time to be open to further devolution’. He said there would be ‘immediate action’ the day after the referendum to start drawing up new powers for Scotland in the event of a No vote.

Formal proposals will be published next month, with draft legislation due in January. He said all three parties were committed to bringing forward the new laws shortly after the general election.

Major's plea: Don't turn friends and neighbours into foreigners

Scottish independence would be disastrous for the entire UK and turn friends and neighbours into foreigners, Sir John Major warned yesterday.

In an impassioned plea to Scots, the former Prime Minister said breaking up the most successful union in history would leave both England and Scotland ‘immensely weaker’.

Sir John said it was extraordinary that the potential consequences for the rest of the UK had barely been debated.

He said the UK could lose its Trident nuclear deterrent, which is based in Scotland, and warned there would be major international repercussions, including the loss of the UK’s seat on the United Nations Security Council.

‘I am desperately concerned,’ he said. ‘We would be immensely weaker as a nation in every respect – morally, politically, in every material aspect – if Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom were to part company.

‘The UK would be weaker in every international body it attends. It would certainly be weaker in the EU and in the forthcoming negotiations. We would almost certainly find increased demands for Welsh independence.

‘Suddenly Scots who work next to us, live next to us, are our friends, our neighbours, our workmates – suddenly become foreigners. Is that not an extraordinary proposition for a nation that had marched together?

‘This year is the 100th anniversary of the First World War. As we honour those who fought together, then would it not be extraordinary if the SNP broke up the most successful union and partnership in all history in any part of the world?’

Sir John slammed the Scottish National Party for its ‘incompetence’ in pushing for independence without even being able to say what currency Scots would use.

He said Scots could find themselves living in a ‘very different country’, despite assurances from Alex Salmond that key institutions such as the pound, the BBC and the Royal Family would remain unchanged.
