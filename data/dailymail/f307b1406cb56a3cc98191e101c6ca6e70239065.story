Prince William likes to tackle meaty issues so he should be the perfect man for a new mission – selling British sausages to China.

The country has an import ban on processed pork products, including bangers. 

But when the Prince opens the Great Festival of Creativity in Shanghai in March, he is being urged to champion British pig meat.

Overturning the ban could produce a £15 million a year fillip for UK farmers, with the potential for further gains. 

The fry-up is becoming popular among China’s middle classes, but the sausage is usually an American-style hot dog. 

China has recently relaxed its ban to allow the importation of non-processed pig products such as spare ribs and pork belly.

The popularity of the Royals could drive British exports.

One firm, Westaways Sausages in Devon, believes it could sell 500,000 sausages a week to China. 

Peter Hardwick, of the Agricultural and Horticultural Development Board, added: ‘We would love to sell sausages to China but it’s a long process.’

Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss said: ‘There’s big excitement about the Duke’s visit. 

'This is a big opportunity for us. 

'The Chinese are focused on food safety and I’m pushing for more inspections so we can sell more pork.’

William’s spokesman said it was ‘too early’ to discuss the visit.
