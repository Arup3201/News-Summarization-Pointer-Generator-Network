Hate your tubby tummy? Then chances are you live in the North, according to new research.

A survey by outdoor fitness club British Military Fitness found the North/South divide is clear when it comes to body image.

It found that Northern women are most hung up on their stomachs, with 87 per cent keen to tone up their tummies.

Regional body hang ups: In the North, women are most bothered about firming up their tummies, while in the South, toned arms are more desired

In comparison, those in the South were more bothered about banishing their bingo wings, with 71 per cent saying this was their area of biggest concern.

Other results from the nationwide survey, where more than 1,000 women were questioned, revealed that four times the amount of women in the North wanted to improve their bust compared to women in the South, who are more confident with their cleavage. 

A regional break down in the results found that women in Manchester were the most unhappy with their tummies, followed by those in Leeds and Edinburgh.

When it comes to bingo wings, those in Brighton had the highest concerns followed by Londoners. 

Southerners were also more concerned about toning up their bottoms when asked which area of their bodies they would most like to improve, while for Northerners another area of concern was their thighs.  

Get a flat stomach: British Military Fitness trainers recommend sit ups and core stability exercises 

Tone up: Push ups are a simple way to get stronger, toned arms

But whatever the body part stressed over, British Military Fitness Instructor, Gary Kerr says there are targeted exercises that can help.

He recommends doing the exercises outlined in the box outs below three times a week to notice a difference in your figure.

For the women up North who want firmer stomachs, he suggests doing 'the plank' to improve the core muscles so the tummy becomes flatter.

He also said the trusty sit up is another way to ensure a toned tummy.

Meanwhile for the women in the South who want their bingo wings to fly away, he says push ups and bench dips three times a week will help.

To tone up the legs and bottom, he suggests squats and lunges. 

Such exercises can be done in the comfort of your own home but for those who need some extra motivation and encouragement, they are also part of the workouts operated by British Military Fitness, who offer 400 sessions a week in more than 140 parks nationwide.

Fitness guru Nell McAndrew is a fan of the outdoor workouts and has regularly attended her local BMF group. 

She Tweeted earlier this year: 'Just did @BritMilFit loved it! Managed (only just) to make it through green session! Blew few cobwebs away! #highlyrecommend #keeponrunning'

THE PLANK 

Adopt a stand similar to a press up but keep your forearms on the ground and shoulder width apart beneath your chest.

Pull your stomach in, keep your body straight and your feet together and balance on your toes.

Hold still in this position for 20-60 seconds - repeating three to five times.

PLANK SUPERMAN

From the normal plank, lift your left foot off the ground slowly.

Then slowly extend your right arm in front of you so you should now be balancing on your left forearm and right foot.

Hold for 10–30 seconds and repeat two to three times on each side. 

DIAMOND PUSH UPS

Place palms on the ground and touch thumbs and forefingers together to create a diamond.

Perform the press-ups by slowly lowering the chest to your hands and push back up.

Put your knees on the ground if you struggle to do 10-12 reps.

BENCH DIP

You'll need a chair or a bench about knee height.

Place hands on the bench directly under the shoulders.

Legs are straight out away from the bench so it is behind you, lower your body slowly until bum nearly touches the ground and push back up.
