The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have incurred the wrath of locals living near the Queen's Sandringham estate after picking 'vulgar' colourful tiles for their country home.

Kate and Wills are putting up a new roof on Anmer Hall and have been accused of turning the Georgian building into 'a Barratt home'.

The mansion's tiles have been replaced over the past weeks and the neighbours are not best pleased with the result.

Now: The roof tiles of Anmer Hall are being replaced as renovation and improvement works continue, before The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge move in, but neighbours are not happy with the colour

The Duke and Duchess, who left a London cinema in tears on Thursday after being informed of the death of Nelson Mandela during the premiere of a biopic of the civil rights hero, are believed to be renovating Anmer Hall to use as a second home.

'The building dates back to the early 1800s but it looks more like a Barratt home now,' one local resident told The Sunday Express.

'It's not an eyesore but it does look completely different.'

Before: The ten-bedroom Georgian mansion as it looked before renovations began this year

The 10-bedroom property is situated on the Queen's private estate at Sandringham and has been the home of company director James Everett and his family for 13 years.

The Everetts is said to have been 
asked to leave four years ahead of the end of their lease in order to 
make way for William and Catherine's young family.

A
 raft of new security measures have also been approved by the local 
council, including the planting of dozens of trees to shield the 
stunning property from public view.

According
 to a planning application lodged with King’s Lynn and West Norfolk 
Borough Council this summer, an existing wood store will be converted 
into extra accommodation – mostly likely for police officers guarding 
the property – while a garage block will be transformed into an 
equipment room.

Other plans 
involve moving the main gates to the property further down the access 
lane so members of the public will not be able to get so close to the 
house.

Anmer Hall, the 10-bedroom Georgian property situated on the monarch’s private estate
 at Sandringham, is the latest in a list of homes for the royal couple.

It has been lived in by company director James Everett 
and his family for 13 years, who also runs his bespoke timber company, 
Norfolk Oak, from its stables.

The
 couple are already renovating another 20-room home in Kensington Palace
 to serve as their primary London residence, which has so far cost 
taxpayers £1.1 million in building costs.

Making changes: The Duke and Duchess are have angered the locals with their choice of tiles for the new roof on Anmer Hall at Sandringham

Apartment
 1A is actually a spacious four-storey, 20-room property with its own 
large south-facing walled garden, which takes up half the Clock Tower 
wing originally designed by Sir Christopher Wren for King William and 
Queen Mary.

It
 boasts generous living space, including five reception rooms, three 
main bedrooms, dressing rooms and bathrooms, a night and day nursery, 
staff bedrooms and ‘ancillary’ rooms.

Former
 residents include Princess Louise, Queen Victoria’s daughter, and the 
late monarch’s grandson, the Marquess of Carisbrooke, followed by, most 
recently, the Queen’s sister, Princess Margaret, and her husband, Lord 
Snowdon.

The
 couple, who moved in following a £1.5million programme of refurbishment
 in 1963, famously installed a ‘futuristic’ new kitchen (which has since
 been ripped out) complete with sleek Formica and teak units.

It
 has been barely touched since the death of the Queen’s sister in 2002, 
however, and in recent years has been managed by the charity Historic 
Royal Palaces (HRP), which used the apartment as office and exhibition 
space.

Sources at the palace have said that Anmer Hall, however, will also be the young family's home fr 'decades'.

According
 to a planning application lodged with King’s Lynn and West Norfolk 
Borough Council, an existing wood store will be converted into extra 
accommodation – mostly likely for police officers guarding the property –
 while a garage block will be transformed into an equipment room.

Other
 plans involve moving the main gates to the property further down the 
access lane so members of the public will not be able to get so close to
 the house.

Royal aides 
have also been given planning permission to begin extensive improvements
 including a new garden room and a pergola made from stone columns with 
oak beams for plants to trail through, providing both shade and privacy 
on the patio area.

The couple's first official home together was in Anglesey, an island off the north west coast of Wales

These 
will be designed by architect Charles Morris, who was behind a 
controversial extension for Prince Charles at his own country home.

Council
 officers have approved the plans under delegated powers, which means 
they did not have to go through the usual council planning process.

Anmer
 Hall is one of 150 situated on the monarch’s 20,000-acre Sandringham 
Estate in Norfolk and is only two miles east of Sandringham House, one 
of her favourite private residences.

The
 hall, which largely dates back to 1802, was used as an illicit 
bolt-hole by Prince Charles and the then Camilla Parker-Bowles during 
their long-running affair when it was rented by the prince’s friend Hugh
 van Cutsem.

Prince 
William, who is close to the van Cutsems’ children, is also said to have
 enjoyed many happy visits to the hall as a child.

It
 also has something of a royal pedigree having been leased to the Duke 
and Duchess of Kent as their country house from 1972 until 1990.

The
 house, which has a swimming pool and tennis court, will provide a place
 where the young family will be able to entertain and host guests.

Plans: A church situated near Anmer Hall on the Sandringham Estate is having to change its entrance to allow the couple their own private entrance

It is also close to Holkham beach where Prince George will be able to play as his father and grandfather both did.

The Sandringham Estate has been owned by the Queen since her accession in 1952 and by the Royal Family since 1862.

The couple's first official home together was in Anglesey, an island off the north west coast of Wales.

Arriving on the island in 2010, William decided to rent a £750-a-month, four-bedroom whitewashed farmhouse from local landowner and long-time royal confidant Sir George Meyrick and his wife Jean in the largely Welsh-speaking hamlet of Bodorgan, on the South-West corner of the island.

The Royal couple used to regularly enjoy Wednesday night suppers of shepherd’s pie and claret up at ‘the big house’ (as the stately pile, Bodorgan Hall, is known) with the admirably discreet Meyrick family.

The farmhouse is in an isolated but breathtakingly scenic position above the Irish Sea, surrounded by private land and overlooking a small beach, accessible only by an hour-long cross-country hike.

In the garden, there is a gas-fired barbecue, which was put to good use by the couple in summer.William openly shared the house with Kate even before their marriage, although she retained her London pied-a-terre for the sake of appearances.
