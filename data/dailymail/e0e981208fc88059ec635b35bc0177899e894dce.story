American footballer Adrian Peterson has allegedly fathered a second love child, this time with a Minnesota nightclub waitress.

Details about the three-month-old baby girl emerged on the day the Vikings star's son Ty died after being beaten, allegedly at the hands of his mother's abusive live-in boyfriend.

In a Facebook post the waitress, who has not yet been named, said she was sorry her little girl would never get to know her big brother.

It is not clear how involved Peterson is with the latest love child, whose mother works at steakhouse, nightclub and sushi bar Seven.

However, a picture of the baby girl, seen by TMZ, shows her dressed in a Vikings baby-gro, leading many to believe the mother is proud of her baby's parentage.

Sources told TMZ the baby's last name is listed as Peterson on her birth certificate.

On the day Ty died, the mother of the latest baby posted on Facebook: 'Today has been a long day finding out my [daughter's] brother passed away and knowing that she never even got to meet him.'

The waitress is said to have met the footballer when he visited the VIP section of the restaurant she works at, according to the Daily News.

Peterson, who has at least four children, only discovered recently that he was the father of Ty.

Houston model Erica Syion however, has claimed
on Twitter that the player has a fifth child - a four-year-old
boy he fathered with her.

She criticized Peterson online yesterday, claiming he hasn't been involved enough in her son's life.

It emerged on Friday Peterson asked for a DNA test to confirm Ty was his about two or three months ago, before he offered to be a part of his life.

He met the two-year-old for the first time when Ty was in hospital being treated for injuries allegedly caused by Joseph Patterson.

As well as the three-month-old baby and his son Ty, Peterson has a ten-year-old daughter Adeja  and another son, Adrian Jr.

After rumors that it was Adrian Jr who had died, the running back took to social media this week to to explain that Adrian, who lives with him, was healthy.

'My son Adrian Jr. who lives w/me is healthy. Appreciate the concern,' he tweeted on October 12.

In a separate post he said: 'The NFL is a fraternity of brothers and I am thankful for the tweets, phone calls and text messages from my fellow players.'

The footballer is due to attend two-year-old Ty's funeral in South Dakota later this week.

However, a man who claims to have raised the 
murdered love child said 
people should stop sympathizing with Peterson because he didn't even 
know the two-year-old.

Bobby
Ruffin posted a rant on his Facebook page after the boy's death on 
Friday saying he was the person who raised him and he was even named 
after him.

'The boy who died was my son. Yes AP was the biological father but I raised him and he carried my name. Tyrese Robert Ruffin.

'I don’t blame AP for not really caring cuz him and I both found out recently who the biological father was. AP met my son for the first time yest [sic] when my son was already in coma.

'I was here today when we pulled the plug, not him. He was happily practicing and has no problem playing on Sunday,' he said.

The man accused of beating the child, Patterson, has been charged with aggravated assault and aggravated battery in the death of  two-year-old Ty.

Initially, police were told that the child had choked on candy. Only later did it emerge that his brain injuries were the result of being violently shaken.

The arrest was made after police found the little boy with injuries 'consistent with abuse'.

Patterson is being held in Minnehaha County Jail, South Dakota, on $750,000 cash bond and was scheduled to appear in court on October 23.
