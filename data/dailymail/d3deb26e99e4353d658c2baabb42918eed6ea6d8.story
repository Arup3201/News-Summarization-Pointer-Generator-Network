US officials have defended a controversial spying program during a Capitol Hill hearing, insisting that 'every nation collects foreign intelligence'.

A panel including Director of National intelligence James Clapper and National Security Agency chief General Keith Alexander told a House Intelligence Committee hearing that US foreign surveillance programs are run responsibly.

The hearing came as the beleaguered White House is considering ordering the NSA to stop spying on leaders of ally nations after it emerged the US has been monitoring German Chancellor Angela Merkel's communications.

Protestors waving placards and wearing clown glasses with 'Stop Spying Slogans' regularly interrupted the hearing.

Separately, federal lawmakers are

databases of communications records that span both the nation and the 
world following the leaks from Edward Snowden.

The panel faced questions against a backdrop of new charges 
regarding U.S. spying on foreign leaders of friendly nations.

Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican, said early on in the hearing that his committee was generally aware of the intelligence community's overseas activities, but stopped short of offering specifics about spying on foreign heads of state.

Clapper acknowledged that if the NSA were surveilling foreign leaders, 'that should be reported to the committee ... in considerable detail' as a 'significant' intelligence activity over which Congress has oversight'.

He added that 'we do only what the policymakers, writ large, have actually asked us to do.'

Rogers
put down a marker as the hearing began by insisting that U.S. spying 
programs are saddled with an unusual 'level of oversight, our commitment
to privacy protections, and our checks and balances on intelligence 
collection.'

The hearing focused on proposed changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a law that governs the procedures that government agencies must follow before they can tap foreign phone lines or otherwise snoop on foreigners' communications, usually in the name of thwarting terror attacks.

'China does not ask a FISA court for a warrant to listen to a phone call on their state-owned and censored network,' Rogers said. 'The Russian Duma does not conduct oversight on the FSB.  But America has those checks; America has those balances.'

When Congress restricts the intelligence community's activities, Clapper said, 'we are incurring greater risks' from foreign adversaries.

Gen. Alexander dispensed with his 
prepared statement and spoke 'from the heart,' saying that his agency 
would rather 'take the beatings' from reporters 'than ... give up a 
program' that would prevent a future attack on the nation.

France, Germany and Spain have complained that the NSA has engaged in snooping that goes far beyond traditional spycraft, aided by new technologies and permissive U.S. policies.

A senior EU official told the Agence-France Presse news agency on Tuesday that Washington urgently needed to rebuild trust with Europe, threatening a stop to transatlantic trade talks and other initiatives.

Viviane Reding, vice president of the European Commission and EU justice commissioner, said Europe's relationships with America were 'shaken and damaged' by accusations that the U.S. had spied on a cell phone belonging to German Chancellor Angela Merkel for as many as 11 years. European, she said, are increasingly feeling like they 'are not seen as partners, but as a threat.'

Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy and Republcan Rep. James Sensenbrenner, the bipartisan pair who co-wrote the USA PATRIOT Act, have called for a new legislative approach to authorizing domestic  spying.

'[T]he dragnet collection of millions of Americans’ phone records every day — whether they have any connection at all to terrorism — goes far beyond what Congress envisioned or intended to authorize,' they wrote in an op-ed in Politico. 'More important, we agree it must stop.'

'It is not enough to just make minor tweaks around the edges. It is time for real, substantive reform.'

Their bill, the USA Freedom Act, proposes to put an end to an NSA program of wholesale collection of domestic phone records, including the dates, times and phone numbers of tens of millions of calls.

The bill would also forbid the NSA from trolling its databases of overseas communications records in search of information that could identify U.S. citizens, including those who may be involved in terror plots against the American homeland.

Such restrictions on American intelligence gathering would have been unheard of only a few years ago, but twelve years after the 9/11 terror attacks the environment in Washington is different.

And the revelations from fugitive whistle-blower Edward Snowden has lit a fire under the U.S. intelligence apparatus, forcing its leaders to defend their practices.

Clapper and Alexander joined NSA deputy director John Inglis and Deputy Attorney General James Cole in Tuesday's hearing, opposing new curbs on their broad powers to sniff out lawbreakers through advanced electronic eavesdropping.

President Barack Obama said he is instituting a complete review of U.S. intelligence procedures in the wake of stinging allegations that the NSA has been peeping on foreign leaders through their phones and email accounts

But the new legislation could be mooted if the White House were to reverse course and order the NSA to stand down through an executive order.

The New York Times reported on Tuesday that President Obama is considering issuing such a directive, specifically in response to the uproar over charges that the NSA had spied on Merkel's cell phone.

And Reuters cited an unnamed U.S. official on Tuesday in reporting that Obama has ordered the NSA to 'curtail eavesdropping on the United Nations headquarters' in New York City.

Obama said Monday during a television interview on the new Fusion TV network that his administration is conducting 'a complete review of how our intelligence operates outside the country.'

Noting the explosion of new technologies whose use by intelligence agencies can spiral out of control, he said he was 'initiating now a review to make sure that what they're able to do doesn't necessarily mean what they should be doing.'

House Speaker John Boehner said that a top-to-bottom review of U.S. intelligence programs was warranted, given the need to temper aggressive information-gathering with the need to respect civil liberties and Americans' rights under the U.S. Constitution.

'We have to find the right balance here,' he said. 'And clearly, we're imbalanced.'
