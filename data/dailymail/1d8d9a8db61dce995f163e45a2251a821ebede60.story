Volunteer divers have joined the hunt for a father's £8,000 prosthetic leg which fell off when he jumped into the water.

Roy Wright, 45, from Addlestone, Surrey, lost the limb at Lake Pier in Hamworthy, Dorset on Saturday, when he jumped into the water to cool off during Saturday's hot weather.

But Mr Wright, who had his leg amputated in 2009, was pulled down by the strong currents and lost the prosthetic limb. He then had to be dragged ashore by passers-by.

Within hours, news of the incident had spread across social network sites, reaching amateur divers all over the country who offered to take part in the search.

The leg - which Mr Wright customised with England football motifs - has still not been found.

But divers have returned to the site and have promised to continue the search - and Mr Wright has been amazed at the kindness shown by virtual strangers.

He said: 'They've even spoken to someone with a cockleboat who is going to drag the seabed with a net to find it.

Mr Wright said he was overwhelmed by the number of people who had helped in the search. A cockleboat is due to drag the seabed with a net in a bid to find the prosthetic

'I'm
 amazed - absolutely amazed - and that's without all the people on the 
day who stripped off and searched the water, and all the kids with 
sticks probing the bottom to see if they could find it.

'People are giving up time after work and in the evenings to try and help find it.

'It brought a tear to my eye - I felt very humbled. It has restored my faith in human nature 100 per cent.'

Mr Wright also described how he was caught out as he went for a swim.

He said: 'I have always said to 
kids: "Don't jump off piers because you don't know what is under the 
water". The water looked really inviting and I just thought I would dive
 in one more time.

I lost my leg and nearly drowned -  
it was a case of not practising what I preached. The water got into my 
leg and pulled it off and there was no way of me getting hold of it.

'The
 water looked calm but I had to fight hard against the current. I was 
really scared and felt really foolish. When I got back to the beach I 
just burst into tears, I was really shaken.

Mr Wright had his leg amputated in 2009, 
after 16 years of battling a leg injury that was caused by a 36-tonne crane 
running over his leg.

After the crane incident, Mr Wright had operations for 11 years to repair the limb.

But just after the final operation in 2009, a supermarket floor collapsed below him, causing him to break his leg again.

He tjem developed gangrene and his leg had to be amputated below the knee one month later.

Mr Wright also thanked the passer-by who jumped in fully-clothed to pull him to safety after he himself dived off the end of pier.

The father-of-three, who is setting up a charity to give amputees holidays, is now struggling on using a painfully ill-fitting spare limb.

He added: 'I'm used to being a very active person.

'There is so much I need to do for the charity and this is holding everything up.'
