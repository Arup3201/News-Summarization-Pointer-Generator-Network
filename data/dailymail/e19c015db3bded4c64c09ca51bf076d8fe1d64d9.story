Ofsted is unfairly targeting Jewish schools because of a 'hodge-podge of Left-wing ideals', one of its inspectors has claimed.

Rabbi Nessanel Lieberman said the watchdog had an agenda to criticise the faith schools because they did not conform to its ideology.

The inspector, registered with Ofsted since 2009, said Jewish schools were increasingly falling foul of new rules on British values.

It comes after two Christian schools were downgraded after inspectors branded children intolerant for failing to give the right answers to questions about lesbians and Muslims.

In October, the Jewish Beis Yaakov secondary school for girls in Salford was also downgraded from good to inadequate and placed in special measures. 

The school's management complained that pupils felt bullied by inspectors' questions about homosexuality and whether they had friends from other faiths.

A growing number of faith schools believe they are falling victim to the Government's drive for British values, devised to combat extremism.

Since the Trojan Horse row last year, in which Islamic extremists were accused of infiltrating schools, all have been required to teach tolerance of other faiths and lifestyles.

Rabbi Lieberman said Ofsted was unwilling to send Jewish inspectors to Jewish schools, even though they might understand the ethos better.

He added the watchdog had 'an agenda to knock down our schools' and described its aims as a 'hodge-podge of Left-wing ideals' designed to clamp down on institutions 'that don't conform to their ideology'.

He told the National Jewish Education Conference for Primary School Teachers in London that Kodesh studies, covering Jewish life, were largely ignored in reports.

He added: 'Non-Jewish inspectors go into Jewish schools with an interpreter. They write a report that doesn't reflect Kodesh studies, even though they may take up to 50 per cent of the school day.'

His comments, reported in the Jewish Chronicle, came as delegates questioned the British values drive at a conference held by Brighton College in London yesterday.

Historian David Starkey said: 'We shouldn't be using inspections to correct political cowardice or political misjudgement. 

'Ofsted is being asked to do things it simply shouldn't be asked to do. The politicians are franchising out their errors of policy.'

Dr Shuja Shafi, general secretary of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: 'We have muddied the water when it comes to British values and have landed ourselves in a mess.'

He added that the country was in 'dangerous times' when society 'turns in on itself, suspicious of others and constantly paranoid'.

He said: 'We must be firm in tackling extremism and terrorism, but this is not the way to go about it.'

An Ofsted spokesman said the watchdog 'is not systematically targeting Jewish faith schools', adding: 'Maintained schools and academies with a religious character are inspected under the same framework, criteria and timeframe as all other maintained schools and academies.

'Ofsted inspectors cannot comment on the content of religious worship or on denominational religious education in maintained schools and academies with a religious character.

'However, they can comment on the contribution of assemblies and teaching (in any subject with the exception of RE) to pupils' personal and spiritual, moral, social and cultural development, and their behaviour and safety.'
