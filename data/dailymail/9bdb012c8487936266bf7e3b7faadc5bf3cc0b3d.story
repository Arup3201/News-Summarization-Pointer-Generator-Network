Allowed out: Gary Kays has fathered a child while on temporary release from prison during his seven-year term for his role in the shooting of Rhys Jones

One of the gang convicted over the murder of 11-year-old Rhys Jones fathered a child while serving his seven-year sentence in prison, it has emerged.

Gary Kays, who helped cover up the youngster's shooting in 2007, was allowed to meet up with his girlfriend after being granted temporary release by prison bosses earlier this year.

Kays, 28, was at her bedside when she gave birth to his second child, a baby boy, last month, it was reported in The Liverpool Echo.

He was freed from jail on licence five days later after serving half the sentence handed down to him for his role in Rhys's killing in Liverpool.

The Prison Service has defended Kay's temporary release, saying it followed standard practices.

But the fact he was able to have a sexual relationship while serving a prison sentence will add further despair for Rhys's family.

His parents have repeatedly spoken of their anger as those jailed over his killing have been set free early from prison.

The youngster was shot in the car park of a pub, in Croxteth, Liverpool, in August 2007 after innocently being caught up in a turf war between rival gangs.

Kays had made the phone call to Rhys's killer, Sean Mercer, 18, to confront rival gang members who'd been spotted at the pub.

And he was with fellow Croxteth Crew gang member Melvin Coy when they picked up the gunman after Rhys's murder and helped him dispose of evidence.

Kays was later convicted of assisting an offender but his release from prison leaves only Mercer and another member of the gang, James Yates, in jail.

The Prison Service would not confirm how often Kays was granted temporary release during his time behind bars.

But it's understood he was allowed to meet up with his girlfriend on several occasions and even kept in touch with her via Facebook from his prison cell.

A Prison Service spokesperson said: 'We do not comment on individual prisoners.

'Prisoners can be released on temporary licence after being thoroughly risk-assessed and subject to conditions of that licence.

'This
allows prisoners to resettle back into the community by giving them the
opportunity to find work, re-establish family ties and ensure housing 
needs are met.

'These are essential components for successful resettlement and an important factor in protecting the public.'

On hearing that Kays and Coy were due to be released from prison, Rhys's father Steve said last month: 'That only leaves Sean Mercer and James Yates now inside. That does not seem right.'

He added: 'Kays and Coy can get on with their lives and do what they want to do. At the time, the prison sentences seem like a good whack, but when they are released it does not seem fair.

'We know they cannot be jailed for the rest of their lives, but we as a family still suffer.'
