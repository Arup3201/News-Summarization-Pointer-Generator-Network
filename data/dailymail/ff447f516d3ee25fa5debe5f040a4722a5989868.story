Police investigating Aaron Hernandez's involvement in a double homicide case are asking for tattoo artists to come forward who may have inked the former New England Patriots tight end's right arm between February 2012 and June 2013.

The Suffolk district attorney's office has stressed that the tattoo artists are not suspected of any wrongdoing, but are considered potential witnesses who ‘may have made observations of evidentiary value.’

Both of Hernandez's arms are covered with tattoos, but police believe that tattoos added to the ex-NFL star's right arm may offer clues to his role in several murders. 

Investigators are asking for help from tattoo artists who may have inked former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez's right arm between February 2012 and June 2013

During the period under investigation Hernandez had a series of star tattoos added, see photo on the right, that weren't present a year earlier when he had played in Super Bowl XLVI in Feb 2012

Hernandez is charged in three killings. 
He is scheduled to be arraigned on May 28 on two counts of murder for 
allegedly shooting two men - Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado - in 
Boston in 2012, prosecutors said on Wednesday.

Authorities
 have not said if there is any connection between those two slayings and
 the 2013 shooting death of Odin Lloyd, a semi-pro football player whose
 body was found in an industrial area near Hernandez's home in North 
Attleborough. Lloyd was dating Hernandez's fiancee's sister.

Authorities didn't describe which of his tattoos they are referring to in seeking artists' help, but photographic evidence suggests that Hernandez had a series of stars added to a design on his right forearm during the period under investigation.

Authorities specifically mentioned several places in their quest for tattoo artists: Hermosa Beach, California; Bristol, Connecticut; Palm Beach and Miami, Florida; Massachusetts; and Rhode Island.

Tattoos are commonly used among criminals to show gang membership and record the wearer's personal history — such as their skills, specialties, accomplishments and convictions.

Certain designs have developed recognized coded meanings.

The code systems can be quite complex and because of the nature of what they encode, the tattoo designs are not widely recognized.

When Hernandez was first imprisoned his body was examined for gang tattoos by officers from the Bristol County House of Correction's gang intelligence unit.

They also interviewed Hernandez about any past gang affiliations.

Hernandez has denied ever being part of a gang and at that time officers determined that none of his tattoos were gang-related.

Hernandez's lawyers have said that their client looks forward to his day in court. He is being held without bail.

Hernandez, 24, has been indicted on two counts of first-degree murder and other offenses in the July 2012 killings of de Abreu and Furtado in Boston. A third man was wounded in that attack, while two others escaped unharmed.

Hernandez and an associate had an ‘encounter’ in a city nightclub with the victims before the shooting, prosecutors said.

After the men left, Hernandez followed in an SUV and pulled up alongside the men as their vehicle was stopped at a red light, and opened fire, Suffolk District Attorney Daniel Conley said.

Conley said there was no evidence that Hernandez knew the victims prior to that evening.

Weeks after the double shooting, Hernandez signed a five-year deal worth about $40 million with the New England Patriots and went on to play 12 games as a tight end that season. A spokesman for the Patriots said the team had no comment.

'Under our system of justice, Aaron Hernandez is innocent of these charges, and he looks forward to his day in court,' said his lawyers, Charles Rankin and James Sultan, in a statement.

Alluding to a news conference held by Conley to announce the charges, the attorneys said they would not try the case in the media.

Conley said the investigation of the Boston killings moved forward after the Lloyd case, which will be tried separately in another Massachusetts court.

He noted the discovery in Bristol, Connecticut, of the car Hernandez was driving the night the men died and the recovery of the alleged murder weapon from an unnamed person with ties to Hernandez.

Conley declined to say whether authorities suspected any connection between the Boston and North Attleborough shootings.

Families of the victims have filed civil lawsuits in February against Hernandez seeking $6 million for the wrongful deaths of the two men.

Hernandez was cut by the Patriots hours after his arrest in the Lloyd case, and head coach Bill Belichick later said he was 'shocked and disappointed' upon learning of the criminal investigation.
