Children in school cadet forces have been warned not to wear their army uniform in public amid fears of a terror attack.

Pupils were also told to carry out searches of training areas and accommodation before setting up camp.

A notice published on a Facebook group told individual units to ensure with ‘immediate effect’ that ‘appropriate security measures’ were put into place in all detachments.

The warnings come just days after serving soldiers were told not to wear their uniform outside barracks amid fears of a copycat attack following last year’s murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby in south-east London.

They were also told not to let strangers know that they are serving in the British Army.

Earlier this week, police were also warned not to wear their uniforms off-duty following an ‘anonymous but credible’ telephone threat.

A Combined Cadet Force source told the Mail: ‘It is such a terrible shame that children are being told not to wear their uniforms. It is sad they can’t proudly walk the streets.’

The threat level for the armed forces was raised from ‘substantial’ to ‘severe’ last week, meaning a terrorist attack on military personnel is highly likely.

An MoD spokesman said the same security measures that applied to serving personnel also applied to cadet forces across the country.

In light of the revised terror threat level, a spokesman for the Middlesex and North West London Army Cadet Force issued a six-point list for managing security for children across the region. The directives issued to more than 1,000 cadets included: ‘No uniform when travelling to and from cadet activities.’ Another rule told members to maintain ‘vigilance when travelling including at motorway service stations… hence civilian clothes when travelling’.

Others warned them to ‘ensure vehicles are guarded or parked in a secure area’ and ‘carry out searches of training areas, ranges and accommodation before occupation’.

They were also told to ensure all accommodation was secure when not in use and to report any suspicious activity.

Military officials took to Twitter to warn cadets not to wear their uniform. A spokesman for the 235 Westminster Cadet Detachment wrote: ‘Reminder not to travel into the unit in uniform. Bring it in a bag and change in the unit.’

Whitehall officials are understood to have noticed increased ‘chatter’ among jihadists wanting to carry out a beheading or other high-profile attack on a serving soldier. Fanatics have been searching online for the location of army barracks across the country to identify targets.

Commanders have told soldiers to act as if the threat is ‘critical’ – the highest level of terrorism alert – and to be ready for an imminent attack.

Last month, 15-year-old army cadet Callum Watkins was attacked with a makeshift flame-thrower as he sold poppies wearing his uniform. The teenager suffered minor burns in the assault in Manchester city centre ahead of Remembrance Sunday.
