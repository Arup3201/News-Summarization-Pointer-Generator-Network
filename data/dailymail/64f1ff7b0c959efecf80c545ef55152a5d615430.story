The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's local petting farm has banned photos on the premises to ensure the privacy of royal visitors, it is claimed.

Prince George, one, and his mother are said to regularly visit the animals at Bucklebury Farm, near Reading, Berkshire, which is close to Duchess's parents' home, Bucklebury Manor.

Now staff at the petting zoo have put signs up banning visitors from taking 'unauthorised photographs ... of other guests,' reports The Sun.

Please, no pictures: Bucklebury Farm Park, the location of Prince George's favourite petting zoo, has banned visitors from taking photographs of other visitors in an effort to ensure the privacy of the heir to the throne

It comes after armed close-protection police surrounded a family after their car broke down on the way to Bucklebury Farm for fear they might be terrorists with a royal target. 

Set in 77 acres of Berkshire countryside, Bucklebury Farm Park offers deer watching, nature walks, indoor play and tractor rides, as well as the petting zoo.

It is highly rated on comparison websites, but locals were not impressed with the farm management's intervention with one telling The Sun's Emily Andrews it felt like an 'overreaction'.

'Every photo we take there, even of our own children, could unwittingly capture other people and their kids,' said the local.

'I took my daughter there the other day and saw Kate's mother with George and his nanny. I thought about taking a photo and decided not to.

'But protection officers still came over to us and challenged us. They were quite difficult about it.'

The attraction describes itself as a family-friendly day out with deer safaris, nature trails and farm animals on the 77-acre site.

Animals include reindeer, llamas, pygmy goats, donkeys, chickens, ponies, cattle, wild boar and even a 'guinea pig village'. 

Older children can also pan for gold, hitch a ride on the zip wire, drive a go-kart, climb a lookout tower or just stay in the playground.

The farm hosts a gold birthday party package including a hot dog and chips meal - though cuddly piglets from the gift shop cost extra. 

Last month it emerged the Duchess of Cambridge, 32, had taken refuge with her parents in Bucklebury, while 'struggling terribly' with debilitating antenatal sickness.

Sources said the Duchess 'hasn't been at all well' as she battles hyperemesis gravidarum, which causes severe vomiting in expectant mothers.

The whole area has since been subject to massively tightened security, as one family found out when their car broke down on the way to a day out at Bucklebury Farm.

Adam De Marco, 40, his partner Claire Lennon, 39, and their daughter Mia, seven, were on a family day out in Bucklebury, near Newbury, Berkshire, when their BMW's tyre punctured.

Their stricken vehicle quickly attracted the attention of royal minders, who ordered them out of the car, they said. But the security men put away their guns when they realised what had happened.

The family say they later spotted Kate, her mother Carole Middleton and Prince George at the nearby farm.

Mrs Middleton has apparently helped to take charge of her recovery and has been researching alternative sickness cures, such as herbal tea, on the internet.

And despite the presence of Spanish nanny Maria Borallo, Mrs Middleton has also been taking George off her daughter's hands. She has been seen in local shops with her 15-month-old grandson, prompting one startled assistant to write on Twitter: 'Served Kate Middleton's mum and Prince George today at work. He is gorgeous!'

The Duchess says she feels far more relaxed at the Middleton family's £5million Georgian mansion, Bucklebury Manor, than at Kensington Palace.

One source told the Mail: 'Kate is feeling so lousy that she just wanted to be with her family and out of public view.

'She is extremely close to Carole, who is very much a hands-on grandmother. Between her and their nanny, Maria, Kate has all the help she needs with George while she is feeling so sick.

'And Bucklebury is somewhere she can just relax and be herself.'

Elizabeth Hartley Russell, whose family owns the Bucklebury Estate, told MailOnline the policy was a 'moral issue' to protect children's privacy and was brought in after the Leveson inquiry.

She said: 'It's not been done to protect any individual - it's been done to protect the rights of children.

'We're a family farm park. We're not here for people to take pictures of other people and put them on Twitter and Facebook.

'We've had children of actors, TV presenters and politicians. All sorts of people have come to visit the farm over a period, as they have to other family attractions. We're not alone in this.

'It's been a long-standing policy that we've had, and it's something we feel very strongly about.'

She added in an e-mail statement: 'This is something of a storm in a tea cup, as our polite request is purely for no unauthorised photographs of other guests not a blanket ban on photography.

'Nor has it been done in relation to any one individual. Like any operator of a family visitor attraction, we are acutely conscious of the rights of the child – any child – to enjoy the freedom and privacy afforded by family days out at venues such as ours.

'The joy of special family moments such as these must be something that all parents and carers identify with and cherish.'
