Actress Julie Walters makes a shocking discovery about one of her ancestors when she discovers that her great-grandfather attacked a man with a knife - and was accused of murder.

In the new BBC1 show Who Do You Think You Are, where celebrities trace their ancestry and discover secrets from their past, Ms Walters, 64, learns relative Anthony Clarke was charged in 1884 after drunkenly attacking the man.

Birmingham born Ms Walters said: 'I will have to write a script about him. What a life he has had.'

Clarke, from Islandeady, County Mayo in Ireland, was charged with murder when the man – a 75-year-old called James Joyce - died a few days later.

But it was downgraded to common assault when it emerged he'd died of natural causes and was not seriously injured in the attack.

The Harry Potter star was initially 
proud after finding out her Irish great-grandfather founded the Land 
League to protect farmers being thrown off their land when faced with 
debt and starvation in the 19th century.

The Land League eventually won tenant farmers the right to buy land and by 1917, most had their own plots.

But Clarke died in 1918 without having benefited from the reforms he fought for because he did not have any land to his name.

Ms Walters, who also starred in Calendar Girls, said:  ‘He still didn't get his land after all that. It is awful being an activist for all those years, he still never got to own his land. He put his neck on the line.

‘An active friend of democracy, I am so proud of him. He was brave and there at the very beginning of the movement that changed the land laws in Ireland.

‘One of the great sadnesses of this story is that Anthony Clarke died without being able to buy his land which he had fought for for 40 years. But his legacy is far greater than that bit of land. He changed history here.

‘A man I have never met and knew nothing of, that I can feel so involved with him. I feel something for him which is an extraordinary thing, do I love him? Yes. That is a wonderful feeling.’

But where Clarke fought for the land rights of farmers, Ms Walters discovers another relative -  great great great grandfather Cummins Buchanan, was a “land grabber”, in the same TV show.

It is revealed that Buchanan stole farmland from others for his boss when they fell behind their rent and voted against reforms which would have helped the poorest in Ireland.

She said: ‘When I first saw that he turned down help for poor starving men, my heart sank,’ she said.

‘To then found he had taken land, like everyone really he was doing the best for his family as he saw it.

‘I am not going to get angry but it is a dreadful thing to do.I can't bear it. To take land off another farmer... gosh an extraordinary thing.’

Who Do You Think You Are? Returns to BBC1 next Thursday at 9pm with Julie Walters' episode.
