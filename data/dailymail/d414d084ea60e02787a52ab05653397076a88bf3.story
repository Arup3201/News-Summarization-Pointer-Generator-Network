It should be a moment of pure unadulterated joy, but this father certainly worries his children before revealing that he has won the lottery.

Sitting his two sons down, he plays his cards close to his chest and instead drip-feeds the information about the win to them with several dramatic flourishes. 

The consummate entertainer builds up the drama and tension by seriously telling them he has some news, prompting the worried boys to ask if it is bad.   

Secret up his sleeve: This father made his sons think that he had some bad news to tell them. In truth the man had won over £1m in the lottery

The mood is sombre to start off as the dad reveals why he has called this meeting.

The boys casually munch on strawberries and sip wine, not knowing how much their life is going to change in a matter of minutes.

‘Hey boys, I’ve looked forward to you coming over for a long time now,’ he says, as the boys settle down in front of him.

‘And I have a hard time trying to say this… It’s not easy for me to say this.’ 

‘It is something bad?’ one son asks nervously.

The father reassures his son that the news isn't bad and then proceeds to tell his children that he has quit his job.

‘What?’ one of the son says, clearly shocked. 

‘But something else has happened,’ he says as the children lean forward. ‘I have won a little bit of money. Little but enough so that I can give a small thing to you.’

The man says: ‘I have won a little bit of money. Little but enough so that I can give a small thing to you,' as he hands over cash to his joyful sons

Counting more cash: The father keeps his cards close to his chest as he refuses to reveal just how much he's won. Instead he keeps giving his children more money

The cool kids continue to eat, not really paying much attention to dad. But they soon sit up when he reaches into briefcase and hands over a wad of cash.

‘Here is 5,000 kroner (£526) for you to go shopping tomorrow,’ he says.

Their curiosity perked, they ask him how much he’s won. But he doesn’t answer, instead handing out iPads to the boys, who have now twigged that something is up.

‘Oh my god,’ they both say in English, as dad continues to give them more money.

‘Are you kidding me?’ one of his sons ask incredulously.

The boys press their father, wanting to know how much exactly he won.

‘I have only won 200,000 kroner (£21,000),’ he says.

The boys are shocked at the sum. ‘In cash?’ one of them says. But little does he know that his dad isn’t telling the truth.

The father lets the news sink in before asking them if they've calmed down.

Cheers! The happy trio celebrating their good fortune. The sons were taken aback when they found out that their father had won over £1m on the lottery

‘I have something more to tell you. This is very difficult to [sic] me. I have lied to you.’

But before he reveals the full sum of his winnings, the joker dad hands over more piles of money to his boys, who are now truly taken aback by the turn of events. 

Reaching over to the far end of the table, the dad takes out even more money and starts slapping it down in front of the boys, who are now incapable of saying anything else other than ‘Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.’ 

‘Do you know how much money I have here?’ the father asks cheekily, as he keeps the game up. 

‘Are you ready?’ he says, holding out a letter.

Holding his head in his hands, the son says: ‘This is crazy.’

‘Boys, I have won over 1 million kroner (over £100,000). A lot more than a million.’

As he says that, he places the letter in front of the boys, so they can see the sum for themselves.

Pandemonium ensues as the boys realise just how much money their father has won.

‘15 million kroner (£1.6 million)?’ they shout. Chairs are pushed away from the table as the boys leap up, shouting ‘Oh my god’ over and over again, as the dad watches with a big smile on his face.
