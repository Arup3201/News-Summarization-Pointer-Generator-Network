The study found the more money a person has the happier they are

Whoever said money can't buy happiness was very wrong, new research has found. 

According to an economic study, the more money a person has, the happier they are.

The latest study of 1,014 people contradicts previous research that said the correlation between money and happiness diminishes when the basic needs of a person are met.

People were asked to rate their levels of happiness and their income was recorded.

Economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin 
Wolfers say in their paper the May 2013 American Economic Review, Papers
 and Proceedings that there is no evidence of a 'satiation' point in the
 link between money and happiness.

They
 wrote: 'While the idea that there is some critical level of income 
beyond which income no longer impacts well-being is intuitively 
appealing, it is at odds with the data.'

Everyone with an income of £306,250 a year or more classed themselves as 'very happy'.

The University of Michigan study found
 that all those earning £61,250 a year or more also described themselves
 as either very or fairly happy.

However,
 only 35 per cent of people taking home £6,125 - the equivalent of 
$10,000 in the exchange rate used in the study - claimed they were 
happy.

A total of 21 per cent in that income bracket said they were 'not too happy'.

The economists wrote: 'The 
income-well-being link that one finds when examining only the poor, is 
similar to that found when examining only the rich', according to AFP.

They
 added: 'We find no evidence of a significant break in either the 
happiness-income relationship, nor in the life satisfaction-income 
relationship, even at annual incomes up to half a million dollars.'

People with the lowest incomes were more likely to describe themselves as 'not too happy'

The latest study comes after a separate study found people who splash out on ‘experiences’ such as days out and concert tickets are happier than those who buy possessions.

Psychologists asked 9,600 people about their shopping habits, as well as questions to ascertain personality traits, values and life satisfaction.

'Experiential shoppers', who bought treats such as concern tickets or weekends away, rather than clothes or gadgets, reported greater life satisfaction, according to the study led by San Francisco State University Assistant Professor of Psychology Ryan Howell.
