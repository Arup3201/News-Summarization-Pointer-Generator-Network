Europe's most senior judge has launched an attack on David Cameron over his criticism of the European Court of Human Rights.

Sir Nicolas Bratza, 66, said one of the key lines of attack, that the court unnecessarily interferes in domestic cases, is 'simply not borne out by the facts'.

He also accused the Government of pandering to the tabloid press.

'It is disappointing to hear senior British politicians lending their voices to criticisms more frequently heard in the popular press, often based on a misunderstanding of the court's role and history, and of the legal issues at stake,' he said.

His comments come on the eve of the Prime Minister's visit to Strasbourg, the home of the ECHR, where he is set to make a speech on what Downing Street described as the 'much-needed reform' of the court.

During his visit to the ECHR tomorrow Mr Cameron will say European judges must be more in touch with public opinion, accept more UK court rulings and let countries protect their own citizens and stop interfering in 'petty' cases

Britain’s £150,000-a-year judge at the court, Sir Nicolas, the son of a Serbian concert violinist, is currently president of the ECHR.

The court was set up in the Fifties largely to prevent a repeat of the human rights outrages of the Second World War. It ruled recently that having a TV satellite dish was a human right and it now has a backlog of thousands of cases. Its judgments are binding on member states.

Sir Nicolas told the Independent that it would be 'deeply regrettable' if the UK's support of the ECHR which is enforced by the Strasbourg court, was to be called into question.

His tough stance follows fury over the court’s ruling last week that Qatada, described as Osama Bin Laden’s ‘right-hand man in Europe’, cannot be deported to face terrorism charges in Jordan because evidence obtained by torture could be used against him.

The Government has also been in debate with the court over the issue of prisoners' voting rights.

Mr Cameron is determined to take advantage of the UK’s chairmanship of Europe’s Council of Ministers, which oversees the court, to force through a shake-up. The Prime Minister believes the court must reflect public opinion and take into account the cultural, historic and other differences between Strasbourg and individual nations.

He is understood to support a cut in the total of 47 judges – one from each member nation. And he wants new rules to ensure they are more in touch with public opinion.

Sir Nicolas maintained that there are reasons for optimism, and that solutions were being sought to the problem of the backlog.

He said the backlog of cases was not linked to inefficiency but is a result of an increase in the number of states signing up to the ECHR.

Sir Nicolas added: 'It is particularly 
unfortunate that a single judgment of the court on a case relating to UK
prisoners' voting rights, which was delivered in 2005 and has still not
been implemented, has been used as the springboard for a sustained 
attack on the court and has led to repeated calls for the granting of 
powers of Parliament to override judgments of the court against the UK, 
and even for the withdrawal of the UK from the convention.'

Sir Nicolas said the influence of the
Strasbourg Court on the UK has been 'overwhelmingly positive', but 
added: 'It would, however, be surprising if all its decisions were 
popular with the government of the day, or indeed understood and 
accepted by public opinion.'

He
highlighted the successes of the court, including making sure children 
are not tried in adult courts and the legal recognition of transsexuals,
and said that the UK's contribution to the convention had been 
'immense'.

Sir Nicolas added: 'The UK can be proud 
of its real contribution to this unique system and its influence in 
bringing about effective human rights protection throughout the European
continent.

'It would be deeply regrettable if it were to allow its commitment to that system to be called into question by a failure to defend it against its detractors or to offer its strong support for the vital work of the court.'

A Downing Street spokeswoman said: 'The Government's position on this issue is a matter of record and has not changed. We believe the court is an essential part of the system for protecting human rights across Europe but it is not working as well as it could and it is in need of fundamental reform.

'Our top priority during our chairmanship of the Council of Europe is to agree a robust package of reform. We want the court to fulfil the purpose for which it was intended - to uphold human rights under the Convention and to tackle serious violations of human rights across Europe.

'There are many others within the Council of Europe who agree that it is time for a reform and we'll be making a number of serious proposals to them - for example, if an issue has been properly dealt with at the national level then it shouldn't have to be gone over again at the Strasbourg level.

'But we do not underestimate the scale of the challenge - it's a complicated and lengthy process to agree reform, requiring unanimity amongst all 47 member countries.'
