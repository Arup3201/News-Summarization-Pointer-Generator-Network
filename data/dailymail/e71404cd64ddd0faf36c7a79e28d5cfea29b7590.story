Chicago appears like a city in the clouds in this stunning photograph taken by a passenger from his plane window.

Plane enthusiast and amateur photographer Mark Hersch captured the jaw-dropping scene of the city silhouetted in Lake Michigan from his seat on a Chicago-bound flight making its final approach.

The late-afternoon image shows the low sun casting a golden glow on the water, which is visible beneath cloud cover.

The buildings of the Windy City cast long shadows out into the water - while closer inspection reveals another passenger jet near the centre of the picture.

Mark said the image is straight out of the camera, without use of image manipulation.

'I was flying home to Chicago from a business trip recently,' he said. 'It was a cloudy day, late in the afternoon. We were flying eastbound, made a pass by O'Hare International Airport, then made a sweeping 180-degree left turn over Lake Michigan for our final westward approach into the airport.

'I looked down and through a narrow break in the clouds, I saw the shadow of the Chicago skyline projecting onto the lake. Oddly enough, I am a very frequent flyer and almost always sit in an aisle set, but on this flight there were only window seats available.

'I grabbed my iPhone and snapped off a single shot, hoping I captured the scene. When I got home I opened the photo on my computer. Not only was I amazed at the shot, but I noticed I also captured another plane on a parallel approach - which you can see if you look closely at the clouds above the skyline in the centre of the image.

'My only regret is that the image is not as sharp as I would like; it's merely an iPhone capture, after all. Ironically, I am an avid amateur photography enthusiast, with some pretty expensive pro equipment.’
