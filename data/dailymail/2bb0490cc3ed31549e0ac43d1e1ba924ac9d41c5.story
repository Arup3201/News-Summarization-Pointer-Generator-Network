A £5m ‘Telletubbies’-style eco-home designed for two Euromillions winners has been given permission to go ahead.

Matt and Cassey Topham, who won £45million in February 2012, have been giving planning permission for their dream home.

The eight-bed house, which will boast a string of extravagant features including a sound-proof cinema, botanical garden and swimming pool, got the go-ahead after a meeting of councillors in Nottingham.

It will now be built on an exclusive road in the city dubbed ‘Millionaire’s Row’. A 1930s mansion that currently stands on the site will be torn down and replaced by the property, a partly-underground dwelling made of four separate pods clad in turf.

Objections to the application were made by English Heritage, which said the design was not in keeping with the architectural heritage of the area, and one other councillor.

But councillor Sally Longford, who represents Wollaton East, the ward in Nottingham where the home is to be built, approved of the plans.

She said: 'I do think this is a fantastic, imaginative design which will sit well in the landscape.

Artist's impression: The house will have eight bedrooms plus a swimming pool and private cinema

Estate: The couple said they would build their dream home when they won the lottery

'The people could have chosen to live anywhere and I am quite glad they have chosen to live in my ward.'

Councillor Malcolm Wood said there was no reason it should not sit among more traditional homes.

He said: 'Over the years, I’ve been calling for more contemporary design and boy, have we got it. I think it’s stupendous and there’s no reason why good contemporary design shouldn’t sit next to classic buildings.'

The house can now be built providing a traffic management plan for the development is agreed.

Jackpot: Mr and Mrs Topham won £45million on the EuroMillions lottery last February

Generous: The pair have paid off relatives' mortgages and given millions away to close friends

When former painter and decorator 
Matt and Casey, both 23, hit the jackpot in February last year, they 
told how they would spend some of the cash on their ‘dream home’. At the
time, they were living in a £89,950 ex-council house in Stapleford, 
Notts.

Within seven months,
the Tophams had bought a 1930s mansion named ‘Rainbow’ for £1.2m - 
which they now plan to demolish to make way for their new home.

Proposals
for the house, named ‘Serenity’, include dozens of solar panels, a 
dramatic sweeping staircase inside, and a garage with space for 10 cars.

It will also back onto the grounds of Wollaton Hall, a stunning country house which appeared in the latest Batman film ‘The Dark Knight Rises’ as the setting for Wayne Manor.

Baca, the London-based architects behind the design, have described the property as a '21st century country house and hidden retreat' which was 'ultra-low in energy use but also high in aesthetic aspiration and quality.'

Adams Hill, where the property will be set, is one of Nottingham’s most sought-after locations, with houses selling for an average of £1.4m over the last three years.

Princess Diana stayed at a house there in 1990 while her then husband, Prince Charles was receiving treatment at the nearby Queen’s Medical Centre hospital for an elbow he damaged while playing polo.
