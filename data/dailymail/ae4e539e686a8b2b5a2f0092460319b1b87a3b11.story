EU lawmakers have changed their minds about plans to ban restaurants from serving olive oil in glass jugs

The European Commission has bottled it over plans to ban restaurants from serving olive oil in glass jugs or dipping bowls.

Bureaucrats had originally argued that diners were at risk of being served 'inferior' or diluted oil, which could also harbour germs if served in an open dish or bottle.

Officials had wanted to force restaurateurs to only serve oil in its original bottles, with tamper-proof lids from January 1 next year.

David Cameron criticised the ban, saying it was 'exactly the sort of area that the European Union needs to get right out of'.

Other politicians also pressed Brussels to drop the dippy rule.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: 'This olive oil ban was virgin on the ridiculous.'

A u-turn was finally extracted from the Commissioner who first proposed the plan, Dacian Cioloş.

At a press conference in Brussels, he said: 'I've decided to withdraw this proposal and not submit it for adoption. I wanted to come here today to demonstrate that I've been very alive to the current debate in the press.'

However the European Commission has plans to revive the topic of how to promote quality olive oil without excessive meddling at a meeting next week in Brussels with hotels, restaurants and consumers .

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said: 'I'm glad the Commission has seen sense and backed down on these arbitrary rules.

'They would have interfered with 
businesses, imposed unnecessary costs and taken choice away from 
consumers. Common sense has prevailed.'

Lib
Dem MEP George Lyon said: 'This has been a bit of a slippery issue for 
the Commission but I am pleased that a degree of common sense appears to
have prevailed.

He added: 
'We will keep up the pressure to make sure that the lid on this silly 
proposal remains firmly sealed.' Critics had accused the European 
Commission of trying to extend an olive branch to oil producers in 
Southern Europe, who had also been most severely hit by the euro crisis.

German
newspaper Sueddetsche Zeitung described the plan as 'the weirdest 
decision since the legendary curvy cucumber regulation', referring to 
the now-shelved EU rules on the shape of fruit and vegetables sold in 
supermarkets.
