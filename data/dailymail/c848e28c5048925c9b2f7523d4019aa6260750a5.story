Images uncovered by the son of a film stills photographer captured actress Lauren Bacall as the doting wife and mother who travelled to Africa to be with her husband Humphrey Bogart while he was filming the classic movie The African Queen. 

In 1951, two of the biggest names in Hollywood, Bogart and Katherine Hepburn, followed director John Hutson to possibly one of the most un-Hollywood locations - a jungle around the Ruki River in the Belgian Congo which is today known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 

Actress Lauren Bacall, who died on Tuesday at the age of 89, flew out to be near her husband Bogart who played Charlie Allnut, a hard-drinking riverboat captain in the First World War romantic comedy adventure.

Photographer Arthur Lemon was there too and captured the stars and crew between takes on the often dangerous shoot.

His photographs offer an insight into the making of The African Queen and the close relationship between Bogart and Bacall. 

Mr Lemon's son Chris found the collection of stills yesterday after the announcement that Bacall had died after suffering a stroke in New York.

He said: 'My dad worked as a stills photographer and this was one of about 70 films he covered.

'He spent several months out there and became very good friends with Bogart, Bacall and Katherine Hepburn.

'I remember him telling me that Bogart and Bacall were very close.

'Bacall had travelled out to see Bogart and spent several weeks out there on location with their son. 

'My dad would always come back with lots of stories. 

'There
 were a few close encounters with crocodiles and hippopotamuses while 
filming The African Queen but I understand they had a lot of fun and 
partied as best they could given the conditions. 

'It was quite treacherous. They were working in difficult conditions. There were people with rifles to protect the crew, actors and actresses. It was a jungle after all where there were things that could eat you.'

It was after hearing the news that Bacall had died that Arthur's son dug out the photo albums. 

'We knew she was out there with Bogart but these photos have been tucked away for years. 

'The African Queen may have featured as a small part of Lauren Bacall's life but her time with Bogart was a major part of her life'

Arthur Lemon got into photography by accident and started taking pictures with a cheap camera at a young age. 

'It blossomed from there', his son said. 

'In 1944 he was in Burma and was appointed combat photographer travelling throughout south east Asia. Many examples of his work are on display at the Imperial War Museum.

'After the war he became a photographer for a national newspaper before becoming a stills photographer in the film industry.

Chris said: 'It's like anything you hang onto. If something crops up you get them out. In this case the death of Lauren Bacall brought things back into focus. I wish I spoke to him a bit more about them now.'

Bacall was a movie star from almost her first moment on the silver screen.

A fashion model and bit-part New York actress before moving to Hollywood at 19, Bacall achieved immediate fame in 1944 with one scene in her first film, To Have and Have Not.

Leaving Humphrey Bogart's hotel room, Bacall — a lanky figure with flowing blond hair and a stunning face — murmured: 'You don't have to say anything, and you don't have to do anything. Not a thing. Oh, maybe just whistle. You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together and blow.'

With that cool, sultry come-on, not only was a star born, but the beginning of a legend, her title burnished over the years with pivotal roles, signature New York wit, and a marriage to Bogart that accounted for one of the most famous Hollywood couples of all time.

The Academy-Award nominated actress received two Tonys, an honorary Oscar and scores of film and TV roles. 

But, to her occasional frustration, she was remembered for her years with Bogart and treated more as a star by the film industry than as an actress. Bacall would outlive her husband by more than 50 years, but never outlive their iconic status.

They were 'Bogie and Bacall' — the hard-boiled couple who could fight and make up with the best of them.

She was less than half Bogart's age, yet as wise, and as jaded as he was. They starred in movies Key Largo and Dark Passage together, threw all-night parties, palled around with Frank Sinatra and others and formed a gang of California carousers known as the Holmby Hills Rat Pack, which Sinatra would resurrect after Bogart's death.

Not until 1996 did she receive an Academy Award nomination — as supporting actress for her role as Barbra Streisand's mother in The Mirror Has Two Faces. 

Although a sentimental favorite, she was beaten by Juliette Binoche for her performance in The English Patient.

She finally got a statuette in November 2009 at the movie academy's Governors Awards gala.

Bacall was born Betty Joan Perske in the Bronx on Sept. 16, 1924 and was raised by her Romanian immigrant mother after her parents split when she was a child.

As a young woman, Diana Vreeland, the famed editor of Harper's Bazaar, thought she was ideal for fashion modeling, and Bacall appeared regularly in the magazine. The wife of film director Howard Hawks saw her on a magazine cover and recommended her as film material, and she went to Hollywood under a contract.

Hawks became her mentor, coaching her on film acting and introducing her to Hollywood society. He was preparing a movie to star Bogart, based on an Ernest Hemingway story, 'To Have and Have Not,' with a script partly written by William Faulkner.

By this time she had acquired the professional name of Lauren, though Bogart and all her friends continued to call her Betty.

In By Myself, she wrote of meeting Bogart: 'There was no thunderbolt, no clap of thunder, just a simple how-do-you-do.'

Bacall was best known for acting opposite her husband, Humphrey Bogart, in several 1940s classics including The Big Sleep, Key Largo and Dark Passage

On her first day of shooting, her hands were shaking so much that she couldn't manage a simple scene of lighting a cigarette.

Work led to romance. The 23-year age difference (he called her "Baby") failed to deter them, but they faced a serious obstacle: Bogart was still married to the mercurial actress Mayo Methot, with whom he engaged in much-publicised alcoholic battles. She was persuaded to divorce him, and the lovers were married on May 21, 1945.

'When I married Bogie', she remarked in a 1994 interview, 'I agreed to put my career second, because he wouldn't marry me otherwise. He'd had three failed marriages to actresses, and he was not about to have another.'

She had son Stephen in 1949 and daughter Leslie in 1952. She also became active politically, joining her husband in protesting the Hollywood blacklist of suspected Communists and campaigning for Democrats. Few could forget the picture of her slouched on top of a piano, long legs dangling, while Harry Truman — then vice president — was seated in front of the keys.

But the party began to wind down in March 1956, when Bogart was diagnosed with cancer of the esophagus. On the night of Jan. 14, 1957, Bogart grabbed his wife's arm and muttered, 'Goodbye, kid.' He died in the early morning at the age of 57.
