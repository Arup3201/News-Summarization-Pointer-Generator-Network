A pregnant Canadian woman who was declared braindead more than a month ago gave birth to a healthy baby boy this weekend. She was taken off life support and passed away one day later.

Doctors were keeping Robyn Benson, of Victoria, British Columbia, alive in the hopes that her young son could have a few more weeks to develop.

Their gambit appears to have paid off on Saturday when Mrs Benson delivered Iver Cohen Benson at 28 weeks.

Mrs Benson's husband, Dylan Benson, posted a picture of himself holding his tiny son on his Facebook page.

Joy: Dylan Benson posted a photo of him with his brand new son Iver Cohen after he was born on Saturday. His mother was braindead for six weeks before she gave birth

He updated his tens of thousands of supporters about the news, which was both joyous and heartbreaking.

'It is with a heavy heart but also with extreme proudness that I am posting this update,' he wrote.

'On Saturday evening, my beautiful and amazing son, Iver Cohen Benson, was born. Iver is healthy and is the cutest and most precious person I have ever met.

'As to be expected, it will still be a bumpy ride for he and I as he continues to grow under the care of the wonderful staff at the hospital.'

Mrs Benson was 22 weeks pregnant when she suffered a massive and inexplicable brain hemorrhage on December 28. There was nothing doctors could do to save her.

However, they were able to give her son six more weeks to develop. At 28 weeks, Iver was born very premature.

Mr Benson also shared sad news with his friends:

'On
 Sunday, we had to unfortunately say goodbye to the strongest and most 
wonderful woman I have ever met. I miss Robyn more than words can 
explain.

'I could not 
be more impressed with her strength, and I am so lucky to have known 
her. She will live on forever within Iver, and in my heart.'

His Facebook status update was shared by more than 4,700 people in just a day.

Mr Benson was able to raise more than $144,000 to pay for his wife's funeral and to support his son's future.

In an interview last month, Mr Dylan said he awaited his son's arrival with the same mixed emotions he expressed in Sunday's Facebook post.

'On one hand, I canâ€™t wait to meet my son and try, and give him the best life possible and try my hardest to be a great dad for him. On the other hand, I know that the day or the day after he is born will be the day that I have to say goodbye to Robyn,' Mr Benson told CBC.

Although Mrs Benson has been declared brain dead, doctors are trying to keep her body alive for another seven weeks, so the baby can be safely delivered by cesarean section.

'Pretty much her body is doing everything but her brain isn't there anymore,' he said, adding that he recently felt the baby kicking for the first time.

The couple, who had been high school sweethearts, married in July and were eagerly looking forward to the arrival of their first child.

When the baby is born, Mr Benson plans to call him Iver - a name the couple had chosen before Mrs Benson's sudden illness.

On the morning that she suffered the brain hemorrhage, Mrs Benson had woken with a piercing headache and asked her husband to go out and buy painkillers.

When he returned, Mrs Benson was slumped unconscious in the bathroom.

Tough times: Dylan Benson is keeping a vigil at the bedside of wife, Robyn, who is being kept on life support until their son is born

She was rushed to hospital but the following day, on December 29, she was declared brain dead.

Mr Benson, who works for an IT company, has had to take time off work to keep a vigil at his wife's bedside.

A You Caring fundraising site has been set up to help Mr Benson, who will be welcoming a baby into the world at the same time as burying his wife.

Initially, the family hoped to raise $36,000 - enough to cover Mrs Benson's annual salary - but in an outpouring of support for Mr Benson and baby Iver, more than C$115,000 ($103,000) has been raised.

In an update on Iver's progress, Mr Benson posted a message on the site saying how touched he was by the support.

He added: 'We had another ultrasound today and things are still looking good for Iver, and Robyn is still holding on strong.'

Money raised through the fund will be used to pay for baby supplies, daycare, housing and an education fund for Iver.

'It is very difficult to know that our son will grow up never meeting his wonderful mother, and that we will have to say our goodbyes to Robyn within hours of seeing Iver for the first time,' Mr Benson said.
