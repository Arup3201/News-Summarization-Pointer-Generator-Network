It seems that almost everyday there's a new advertisement for the last must-have piece of technology.

But IKEA just one-upped the competition with the announcement of their 2015 catalogue aka 'bookbook' - a play on Apple's MacBook.

This parody video is particularly timely as Apple gears up to launch the new iPhone with what will surely be a hyperbolic and exquisitely designed ad campaign. 

Scroll down for video

IKEA's new advertisement for their 2015 catalogue is a blatant parody of Apple's ad campaigns

'The first thing to note is no cables,' the satirical ad points out

'The interface is 7.5 x 8 inches. But can expand to 15 x 8 inches,' the narrator explains

'Once in awhile, something comes along that changes the way we live,' the advertisement begins.

'A device so simple and intuitive, using it feels almost familiar.'

'Introducing the 2015 IKEA catalogue.'

'The first thing to note is no cables - not even a power cable,' Jurgen continues. 'Not even a power cable. The 2015 IKEA catalogue comes fully charged and the battery life is eternal.'

The entire advert is narrated by Jorgen Eghammer, dubbed the Chief Design Guru

The advert demonstrates the 'bookbook's' unique ability to expand its interface - simply by opening it

'Navigation is based on tactile touch technology. To start browsing, scroll right to left to move forward and left to right to move backward.' 

'Notice something else? That’s right – no lag. Each crystal clear page loads instantaneously, no matter how fast you scroll.'

And when it comes to bookmarking, the 'bookbook' has that covered, too.

'If you find something you want to save for later, simply bookmark it,' the model demonstrates by turning down the top corner of the page. 

'Content comes pre-installed via 328 high definition pages,' Jurgen teases in the video

'Even if you close the application, you can easily find the bookmark again. Amazing.' 

For multiple users, the 2015 IKEA catalogue offers a colour-coded tab system to avoid confusion.

'If you want to share a particularly inspiring item, you literally share it.'

'Another special feature is password protection, which is voice-activated.'

All you need to say is: ‘Excuse me, that’s mine!’

'At IKEA, we feel that technology is life-enhancing and should be at the hands of everyone,' the advert concludes. 

'So, the 2015 IKEA catalogue is free.' 

The advert also joking offers voice-activated security protection. Simply say, 'Excuse me! That's mine!'

Behold IKEA's colour-coded system software - if you'd like to share a page with a friend, simply place a tab on it
