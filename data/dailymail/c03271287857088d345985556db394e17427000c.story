A taxi driver could lose his cab licence after refusing to take a fare because the passenger had a guide dog.

James Chesney, 53, was fined £1,000 for telling the customer his boss would ‘go ballistic’ if the golden retriever was allowed into the car.

The driver claimed Desmond Baldwin's guide dog, Denby, could cause the daughter of one of the other drivers to have an allergic reaction.

Chesney, from Droylsden, Tameside, was charged under the Equality Act with refusing to take a pre-booked disabled passenger because he was accompanied by an assistance dog.

He denied the offence but was found guilty by Manchester magistrates after a three-hour trial. He was fined £300 and ordered to pay £800 costs.

The court heard how Mr Baldwin had pre-booked the taxi to go for a meal with friend Stephen Kingsberry, who is also blind, at The Pearl restaurant in Audenshaw on June 24.

Laura Raine, prosecuting on behalf of Manchester council, said that when Chesney arrived he refused to take the fare, stating his boss would ‘go ballistic’. 

Mr Kingsberry’s carer Pauline Harrop told magistrates she was ‘100 per cent sure’ that Chesney refused to take them on those grounds.

Chesney said he believed the car was exempt from taking guide dogs because his colleague - who also drove the vehicle - had a poorly daughter who may be allergic to dogs.

But he also claimed he was about to take the men to the restaurant when another cab, from Hastings taxis, the same company, pulled up and took them.

James Street, defending, told the court the firm had sent another car as a replacement and added: 'He didn’t refuse the job, he queried it, and when he was told to go (and do the job) he did it.'

Magistrates ruled that Chesney ‘appeared confused by the sequence of events’ when he gave evidence in court, while Mr Baldwin and Miss Harrop were ‘clear and concise’.

Speaking after the hearing, Mr Baldwin, 59, from South Elmsall, near Pontefract, West Yorkshire, said: 'I’m glad he’s been found guilty. It’s over with now, and let’s hope it reminds the other taxi drivers they can’t refuse people with guide dogs.'

Mr Kingsberry, who made an official complaint which sparked the investigation, added: 'I believe everyone who has a guide dog has the right to go where they want.'
