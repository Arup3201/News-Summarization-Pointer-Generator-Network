Fresh-faced Sophie Wessex looked summery and chic as she opened the butterfly display at Hampton Court Palace today.

Sophie, 48, arrived to open the Plant Heritage Marquee and the show's main display, the Butterfly Dome with Eden, which is Britain's biggest ever butterfly show.

The Hampton Court flower show, Britain's largest at 34 acres will attract over 600 exhibitors this year and opens to the public tomorrow.

The huge butterfly display is a late replacement for Diarmuid Gavin's planned centrepiece.

Showman Gavin, 49, wanted to create an extravagant Willy Wonka-style chocolate themed garden using 18 shipping containers.

His proposed 2,000 square metre flight of fancy would have been the biggest ever garden at Hampton Court but the maverick Irishman failed to find a sponsor.

With less than three months to go until 
the world's largest flower show, the Royal Horticultural Society turned 
to the Eden Project for an alternative main feature.

It agreed to recreate the Cornish site's world-famous rainforest biome and will exhibit 3,000 tropical butterflies in a 80ft by 30ft high dome.

The RHS takes 11 months to plan its show, which this year has 34 gardens, including eight large show gardens. With more than 600 exhibitors this will be Britain's biggest and brightest flower show.

But the Eden Project's Catherine Cutler revealed: 'We only knew we were doing this dome 11 weeks ago.

'The RHS approached the Eden Project, saying the pitch was vacant because Diarmuid Gavin had pulled out.

'They asked if we could do a biome like at Eden. The public will experience what it is like in the canopy of a rainforest.

'We've brought in thousands of plants, including loads of nectar plants for the 3,000 butterflies.

'We have a ramp to get people into the biome and we'll be able to get up to 200 in at a time.

'The guys from the science team at Eden have designed interactive stuff. There's an activity zone for the kids to meet the butterflies.'

When the event opens on Tuesday, visitors will be able to experience jungle conditions and rainforest plants from a raised walkway.

Unusual varieties of butterfly on display will include the spectacular blue morpho, which has metallic, shimmering bright blue wings.

There will also be owl butterflies, 
which can grow up to eight inches in diameter and have patterned wings 
that resemble owls' eyes.

Plants
on show will include a Titan Arum - nicknamed 'Corpse flower' due to 
its pungent odour of rotting flesh - as well as orchids and palms.

The
show's manager Mandy Almond: 'Bringing the UK's largest butterfly 
rainforest experience to RHS Hampton Court Palace Flower Show is an 
extremely exciting and challenging project, which will create a truly 
tropical spectacle for visitors.

'The
dome will give visitors the chance to see the life-cycle of this 
remarkable insect and marvel at the astounding variety of shapes and 
colours they display.'

RHS shows director Stephen Bennett said that 153,000 visitors are expected between July 9 and 14 - well up on last year's 126,000.

He said: 'The butterfly dome is going to be a highlight.

'Unfortunately Diarmuid Gavin was unable to find a suitable sponsor for his concept this year.'

Leading designer Chris Beardshaw will be among those vying for a coveted gold medal with his garden for the over-60s.

Jenna Stuart's 'The Witches of Macbeth' design imagines the witches' home in William Shakespeare's play.

It has a dilapidated house that is overgrown with the plants used in the witches' concoctions and a bubbling cauldron.

Meanwhile, Caroline Tait's eye-catching Tip of the Iceberg conceptual garden has 300 delicate alpine flowers growing around a stack of Zanussi fridge freezers.

This year's show also has three zones: Grow, Escape and Inspire.

In Grow, keen gardeners will find nurseries, plants stalls, potting bench demonstrations and stands selling gardening equipment.

In Escape, they can learn how to grow their own fruit and veg, admire the show's famous roses and taste offerings from artisan food producers.

The Inspire zone concentrates on innovative garden design and making the most of outside space.Gavin's planned chocolate-themed, 25ft high garden was due to have steps leading up to 18 glass-fronted shipping containers.

It would have featured colas - tropical trees that are part of the chocolate plant family - towering cypresses, topiary balls, fields of crops and chocolate smells.

Britain's biggest flower show opens to the public tomorrow running until July 14.
