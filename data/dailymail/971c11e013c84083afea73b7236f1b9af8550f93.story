Daniel Sturridge is over England's World Cup exit and has claimed he is already looking forward to helping spearhead Liverpool's Premier League charge next season.

The striker was part of Roy Hodgson's side who were dumped out in the group stage, but admits he can't wait to return to domestic action and help the Reds try and go one better than their runners-up spot they achieved last term.

Sturridge rifled in 24 goals last season and will be expected to bag most of the Merseyside's club strikes during the 2014/15 campaign following the sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona for £75million.

The 24-year-old has admitted that losing out to Manchester City last term hurt but that the club are fully focused on the season ahead, as the striker enjoys a post-World Cup break before returning for pre-season.

'We missed out on winning the league last season which is kind of hurtful, but we are moving on now and we are looking forward to next season,' Sturridge told the Jamaica Observer.

'We are looking forward to a big year, it is going to be a big season and we can't wait to go on as it is going to be amazing.

'It is a great feeling [to play for Liverpool]; it is a lot of people's dream to be playing for a club like Liverpool, and so I am living my dream and I am thankful for everything that has come my way.

'I am looking forward to the future, as I said before, it is going to be a big deal for me and I am really excited.'

Sturridge scored one of England's only two World Cup goals in the 2-1 defeat by Italy but backs the Three Lions to imrpove as a team before the Euro 2016 qualifiers.

'It hurts, but you know in situations like these you live and learn,' Sturridge said. 'You improve from these disappointments and I am looking forward to the future.

'There have been a lot of things that have happened and a lot of things that we have experienced and it has been a great learning curve for us. We are looking forward to the future where we can improve as a team.'
