Married to one of the world’s most famous and controversial media tycoons it may come as little surprise that Wendi Deng Murdoch practises tough love with her children.

Now Mrs Murdoch has been revealed as a fan of ‘Tiger Mom’ Amy Chua - even emailing the author to request a play date for their four daughters to meet, The New York Times reported.

Just before the Wall Street Journal, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch, ran an excerpt from Chua’s child-rearing manual, 'Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother,' Mrs Murdoch fired Chua an email suggesting a get-together.

'She wanted her daughters to come to New Haven and meet my daughters,' the controversial author told the paper.

Despite an age gap – Ms Chua’s daughters Sophia and Lula are 19 and 16 respectively while Chloe and Grace are 10 and 8, the girls share common ground.

All four girls are fluent in Chinese and English and have Chinese mothers who adhere to strict parenting methods.

Indeed, at their first meeting Mrs Murdoch turned to Ms Chua for advice, including how to get a child to do piano practice for more than an hour a day, the Tiger Mom told the paper.

‘She parents almost identically to the way I do,' 49-year-old Ms Chua said.

Ms Chua, a Yale law professor, shot to fame after her parenting manual was published in 2011.

In it, she described her efforts to give her two daughters a traditional strict 'Chinese' upbringing and argues that 'Western' parents put the self-esteem of their children before academic success.

She was vilified for her super-strict parenting style which includes banning sleepovers and television and never accepting a grade lower than an A.

No stranger to a public backlash, Mrs Murdoch was on hand to offer Ms Chua some hard-hitting advice – ‘get over it’.

'She was like: "Why do you care what people think? You have two wonderful daughters. Get over it,"' Ms.Chua recalled to the New York Times.

While she may not have seemed particularly sympathetic Rupert Murdoch’s third wife was, presumably empathetic.

Almost four decades younger than her husband Mrs Murdoch, 43, has been labelled - amongst other insults - a 'gold digger' since the couple wed in 1999.

However, opinion on Mrs Murdoch as a mere ‘trophy wife’ seemed to shift last July during her husband’s testimony before a British parliamentary subcommittee over the phone hacking scandal.

Mrs Murdoch - now famously - sprang from her chair, hitting protester wielding a piebefore he could attack her husband.

Fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg, an old friend of Mrs Murdoch’s, was not surprised to see her leap into the fray for her husband.

'Nothing characterizes her more than that moment. She is protective and fierce and not afraid of anything,' she told the New York Times.

However Mrs Murdoch is more than her 81-year-old husband’s unlikely look-out and continues to carve out a career of her own, including projects in the film business. 

Her first film, 'Snow Flower and the Secret Fan', which she produced with Florence Sloan, the Chinese wife of ex-MGM studio chief Harry E. Sloan, came out last year.

Poor sales figures – it only took about $11 million worldwide – can partly be attributed to timing.

The film release came just as revelations surfaced that her husband’s newspaper – News of the World – had hacked into the voice mail of missing schoolgirl Milly Dowler, who was later discovered to have been murdered.

Now Mrs Murdoch, again pairing up with Mrs Sloan, is preparing to sign a deal with Sony Pictures for her second movie project. This one is about the Chinese pianist Lang Lang.

Despite her fierce ambition – and strict parenting style – Mrs Murdoch can display a sharp sense of humour, according to Arianna Huffington.

When the two high-flying women hosted guests, including Joel Klein and Harvey Weinstein, at a book launch in Manhattan last year Mrs Murdoch was miffed at the vegan food on offer.

Speaking to the New York Times, Ms Huffington recalled the toast Mrs Murdoch gave: 'She said, "I grew up so poor in China that one day I aspired to have meat regularly. Now that I can have meat three times a day, Kathy tells us we can’t have any meat at all." '
