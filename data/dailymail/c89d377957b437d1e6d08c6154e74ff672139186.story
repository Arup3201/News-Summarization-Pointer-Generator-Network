Police are hunting for a 'bra bandit' who has allegedly stolen more than $14,000 worth of Victoria's Secret products from a Pennsylvania store.

The unknown suspect has hit the Wyoming Valley Mall branch of the women's lingerie chain five times in the past 12 months, according to the Times Leader.

However, there appears to be no clear CCTV footage to identify the underwear-loving criminal.

In the latest heist, which took place on Saturday morning, a dozen bras were apparently taken from a rear display unit valued at $500.

The alleged crimes date back to March 2014 when the Victoria's Secret store manager reported $4,014 worth of clothing had gone missing.

It was unknown when the merchandise was stolen. 

Then, in July, 75 bras valued at $4,200 were reported stolen from the same store.

Everything went quiet until this year when 94 bras valued at $4,166 were reportedly purloined from a display case on February 17.

Just over a week later, on February 26, the store manager reported 39 bras valued at $1,773 had disappeared. 

The value of the looted merchandise adds up to $14,653.

In each of the thefts there was no clear suspect description provided by store security.
