Mixed blessing: This wrenching pictures shows Josh holding his newborn son Logan for the first and last time

A 24-year-old Utah college student died on Friday after living just long enough to hold his newborn son before slipping into a sudden coma from which he’d never wake up.

Brigham Young University student and Mormon seminary teacher Josh Robison fell ill just hours after holding his son Logan for the first time and then suddenly lost consciousness.

It began with a simple headache and ended with doctors trying desperately, but failing, to keep the young dad from slipping away.

It was an unexpected and heart-wrenching turn in a story that, for a time, was full of hope.

Robison
 and his wife of 18 months, Erica, were excited to embark on their new 
life as parents when Josh came down with flu-like symptoms while 
spending the Thanksgiving holiday with his parents in Fillmore, Utah.

Doctors eventually discovered he was suffering from a treatable staph infection, according to KSL.com.

‘It took a few days until they traced that to a valve in his heart,’ said Josh’s grieving mother Jodi Robison.

But
 when they did discover the infection was in his heart, doctors acted 
fast. Josh underwent surgery to replace his heart valve.

At first, everything seemed great.

‘He was improving, and they were quite pleased,’ Jodi said.

Josh had recovered enough by December 12 to be there for the birth of his son, who he and Erica named Logan. But soon after holding his son for the first and only time, Josh complained of a headache.

‘When they took him down to the CAT scan, that's when he lost consciousness,’ Jodi said.

Josh had suffered bleeding in his brain, the cause of which still remains a mystery.

Doctors rushed him to the OR, but he would never wake up.

The new father was taken off life support on Friday night.

Despite her horrific emotional roller coaster, Josh’s mother remains grateful her son got to meet his own child.

‘It's not so overwhelming as it is awe-inspiring and inspirational,’ she told KSL. ‘It was a miracle.’

Also looking on the bright side was Josh’s bereaved wife Erica, for whom friends and family have opened a crowd-funding drive on GiveForward.com.

‘This is without question the most difficult experience of my life, but it has warmed my heart to be so overwhelmed with love and support from friends and strangers alike,’ Erica said in a statement.

As of Sunday night, the nearly $40,000 had already been raised.

'It's not so overwhelming as it is awe-inspiring and inspirational,¿ said Josh's mom Jodi after her son died after living long enough to hold his son just once. ¿It was a miracle.¿
