When Nina Langley experienced excruciating pain seven-and-a-half months into her pregnancy, she assumed she was going into labour early.

The 32-year-old went to A&E, prepared to give birth to her baby son, Teddy.

Instead, she was given the devastating news that the pain was being caused by bowel cancer that had spread to her liver.

A year ago she had also been diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, a disease which sometimes has similar symptoms to bowel cancer.

Nina Langley, 32, was rushed for an emergency Caesarean section at seven-and-a-half months pregnant, after doctors discovered she had cancer. She is pictured with son Teddy

Miss Langley began suffering unbearable pain and believed she was going into labour early, but when she went into hospital tests revealed she had bowel cancer that had spread to her liver

Miss Langley's fiancé, Ed Cusick, who had proposed five months ago, said hearing Nina had cancer was the worst moment of his life

Then, throughout her pregnancy she had suffered rib and shoulder pain, but doctors reassured her this was probably being caused by the strain of carrying a baby.

Miss Langley was rushed for an emergency Caesarean to deliver her son Teddy six weeks early so she could start life-saving treatment.

Now she is set to start chemotherapy once her body has recovered from the operation.

Her fiancé, Ed Cusick, who proposed five months ago, has been left heartbroken by her diagnosis.

Mr Cusick, 38, a musician, said: 'Nina is my whole world and I'm completely devastated that she has been diagnosed with cancer.

'We were so excited about becoming parents but Nina's shocking diagnosis has overshadowed our happiness.'

Miss Langley, a graphic designer from Buckingham, had consulted doctors about the rib and shoulder pain she was suffering, but had been reassured it was pregnancy-related.

Then on February 8th, the pain became so unbearable she began to worry she might be going into labour and so went to A&E.

As Teddy was born six weeks prematurely, he was kept in hospital so doctors could monitor his growing 

Mr Cusick is terrified his fiancé will not live to see her new son grow up, and has began researching specialist cancer treatments online and fundraising to pay for them

Mr Cusick said: 'The thought of meeting our new baby filled us with months of excitement but suddenly the experience turned into a living nightmare.

'I never expected it be to cancer, I wouldn't wish this pain on anyone.

'But I need to stay strong for Nina and I decided to put a status on Facebook as a cry for help and that led to me setting up a fundraising page to help with the costs of life-saving specialist treatments that aren't available on the NHS.'

Doctors believed Miss Langley might have an infection in her liver, but a biopsy confirmed she had primary bowel cancer that had spread to the organ.

She was sent for an emergency Caesarean on February 17 to deliver her son Teddy, who was born prematurely, weighing 5lbs 13oz.

Mr Cusick said being told of the diagnosis was the worst moment of his life.

He said: 'It was a moment of complete dread and fear when we first heard the word cancer.

'Nina was a lot braver than me at first, I just can't imagine losing her as she's my whole life along with Teddy.'

The news was all the more devastating given that Miss Langley's own father had passed away from cancer in October. 

Now, Miss Langley is due to start chemotherapy next week, after her body has healed from the emergency Caesarean.

The couple have decided not to ask doctors what Miss Langley's prognosis is, in order to remain positive.

Mr Cusick said: 'We haven't asked about what the future holds for Nina, we just need to stay positive as possible.

Mr Cusick has been left heartbroken by the news Nina has cancer. He said: 'I just can't imagine losing her as she's my whole life along with Teddy'

A year ago, Miss Langley was diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, a disease which has many of the same symptoms as bowel cancer. She is pictured with her fiancé on holiday last year

'It's a petrifying worry for Nina that she won't see our Teddy grow up but with the help of specialist treatments and those provided on the NHS we aim to throw everything we've got at this cancer so we can stay together as a family.'

After Miss Langley was incorrectly diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Mr Cusick hopes her story will be a warning to others with similar symptoms to seek help.

She was suffering stomach cramps and going to the toilet more often than usual, which doctors said was due to IBS.

But because she was so young, no further tests were carried out.

Mr Cusick said: 'I hope other people read Nina's story and seek a second opinion if they feel they have worrying symptoms.'

The couple were allowed home on February 22, two weeks after first going to A&E with possible labour pains.

'She is my soul mate, I can't believe this has happened,' Mr Cusick said of the cancer diagnosis

As Teddy was born prematurely, he was kept in hospital and fed via a tube, so doctors could monitor his growing,

The finally was finally reunited when he came home three days ago.

Mr Cusick said: 'Teddy coming home has really lifted Nina's spirits, I haven't hardly slept since he has been home but it's amazing that we are finally all together.

'We are supposed to be excited new parents but this joy has been masked by the fear of Nina's diagnosis.

'Nina watched her dad die from brain cancer in October and having Teddy this year the light at the end of the tunnel, it's just so cruel and unfair that Nina has been diagnosed with cancer as she is one of the nicest people you'll ever meet.

'I proposed to her five months ago, she is my soul mate, I just can't believe this has happened to us.'

Desperate not to lose his fiancé, he has began researching specialist treatments online, many only available abroad, which he hopes may prolong her life.

He has even begun fundraising money to pay for treatment, if doctors agree they could help beat Miss Langley's cancer.

He said supportive friends and family have rallied round the couple, pledging thousands of pounds towards the treatments and organising a fundraising events for Miss Langley's cancer fight.

Mr Cusick said: 'The support we have received has been fantastic, every little helps and I want Nina to receive the best possible treatment available so if we need to go half way across the world to get it we will.'

'One of the specialist treatments we are considering is called Nano Knife which targets tumours faster alongside her chemotherapy, we just need to hit her cancer with everything possible.

'Losing Nina is not an option, I would devote to my whole life to ensure she beat this.'

Three three main symptoms of bowel cancer are blood in the stools, abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits such as looser, more frequent stools

The three main symptoms of bowel cancer are blood in the stools, changes in bowel habit (such as to more frequent, looser stools) and abdominal (tummy) pain.

However, these symptoms are very common and most people with them do not have bowel cancer.

For example, blood in the stools is more often caused by haemorrhoids (piles), and a change in bowel habit or abdominal pain is usually due to something you have eaten. 

As almost nine out of 10 people with bowel cancer are over 60 years old, these symptoms are more important as people get older. They are also more significant when they persist despite simple treatments.

Most people who are eventually diagnosed with bowel cancer have one of the following symptom combinations:

The symptoms of bowel cancer can be subtle and don’t necessarily make you feel ill.
