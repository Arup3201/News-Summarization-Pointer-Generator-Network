New grilling: Shrien Dewani during his trial in South Africa. The millionaire could face his first public questioning over his wife's death in a UK inquest

Shrien Dewani could face his first public questioning under oath over the murder of his wife Anni on their honeymoon in South Africa in a resumed UK inquest into her death.

The North London coroner has reportedly told the care home millionaire he is considering resuming the inquest into the 2010 death, which was adjourned during the police investigation.

A South African court in December cleared Mr Dewani of involvement in his wife's murder, but there were complaints from Anni's family that the Bristol-based businessman was not forced to testify.

South African prosecutors had alleged that Mr Dewani was a bisexual who arranged his wife's murder to cover up for his double life as a client of sadomasochistic male prostitutes.

North London coroner Andrew Walker has now emailed individuals linked to the case to tell them he is ready to resume the inquest into Anni's death, The Sun reports.

The Sun says Anni's father, Vinod Hindocha, and her uncle, Ashok Hindocha, are due to meet Mr Walker on Tuesday to discuss the case.

MailOnline contacted the coroner's office on Sunday morning, but no-one was able to comment or confirm the report.

It comes after a formal complaint was last week lodged against the judge presiding over Dewani's trial.

A group of academics and lawyers from South Africa's Higher Education Transformation Network (HETN) criticised Judge Jeanette Traverso's handling of the case last year, accusing her of 'gross judicial bias and misconduct'.

The judge called a halt to the trial in December, two months into the hearing, after an application from Mr Dewani's counsel that the prosecution case was flawed.

Mr Dewani, 34, fought a long UK court battle against extradition before being sent to South Africa where he was cleared of instigating a plot to murder Anni.

The Swedish-raised engineer was shot dead as the couple toured a rough suburb of Cape Town on November 13, 2010.

Grief: Vinod Hindocha weeps in court during Mr Dewani's trial. He has said the case was not fully heard because Judge Jeanette Traverso, right, threw it out before Mr Dewani took to the witness stand

HETN chairman Lucky Thekisho said: 'Article five of the Judicial Code of Ethics requires judges to act honourably not only in the discharge of official duties but to act honourably and in a manner befitting judicial office in a professional manner that enhances the public trust in or respect for the judiciary and the judicial system.'

Lawyer Mr Thekisho urged South African judicial authorities to suspend Judge Traverso pending an investigation.

Ashok Hindocha - the victim's uncle, and one of several members of her family to sit through the trial in Cape Town - told the Press Association: 'We agree that Anni did not get a fair trial.

'The case was not fully heard, she (judge Traverso) should have let Shrien take the stand.'

Three men - Zola Tongo, Mziwamadoda Qwabe and Xolile Mngeni - already serving jail terms for their role in the killing claimed Mr Dewani arranged a hijacking-gone wrong in which he would survive and his wife would be killed.

But Judge Traverso ruled their evidence was flawed and the case was thrown out before Mr Dewani could give evidence in the witness box.

The trial was riddled with delays while swathes of evidence were dismissed or considered irrelevant to the case.

German prostitute Leopold Leisser was lined up to testify about bisexual Mr Dewani's double life, but his court appearance was reduced to little more than a 15-minute offering after the judge decided it contributed little to the evidence already submitted as part of Mr Dewani's witness statement.

Qwabe struggled to tell the difference between his right and left while another star prosecution witness - self-styled middle man Monde Mbolombo - was granted immunity by the state for testifying against the Briton.

Mr Dewani, who had spent eight months undergoing treatment at a hospital on the edge of Cape Town after being extradited to South Africa, was not called to give evidence in his own defence.

He returned to England at the conclusion of the case without ever commenting in public. He has always denied any involvement in his wife's murder.
