Outrage: Eppie Sprung Dawson, pictured arriving at Dumfries court yesterday, is now living Matthew Robinson, the student she was found to be having sex with when he was just 17

A Sheriff has sparked anger after claiming a teacher convicted of having sex with a pupil had made ‘exemplary’ progress in counselling sessions – even though she is now living with her victim.

Eppie Sprung Dawson, 27, lost her job and her marriage after being found half-naked in a layby with teenager Matthew Robinson, who was 17 at the time.

It emerged last week that she is now living with him in her former marital home, only two months after being placed on the sex offenders’ register. He claims they are not in a relationship.

Remarkably, when the case returned to court for an update on Sprung Dawson’s Community Payback Order (CPO), Sheriff George Jamieson said reports from social workers showed her progress was ‘exemplary.’

The comments were criticised by the family of Matthew Robinson, now 18, who also pointed out she had escaped having to do any actual work as part of her CPO.

Last night, mother Sheree said: ‘There was no mention at all about Matthew being at her house.

‘When I heard she had been called “exemplary”, I couldn’t believe it. If she was truly exemplary – and had learned from this – there is no way she would be living with Matthew.

'It seems she has been helped, not punished, while our family has been going through hell.

‘We thought she would be picking rubbish off the street but in fact she just had to go and see a psychiatrist. She’s a very clever person. She’s got away with it.’

Mrs Robinson said Sprung  Dawson approached her at Dumfries Sheriff Court, where the hearing was held yesterday, and asked to talk to her – but she declined.

Sheriff Jamieson was told by Sprung Dawson’s lawyer, David Finnie, that his client had responded well to counselling.

Apparently unaware of reports that she was living with her victim, Mr Finnie said: ‘In the week prior to her review, for some mysterious reason, there seemed to have been excessive interest from the Press.’

Outcome: Sprung Dawson (right) was ordered to complete a course of psychosexual counselling and place on the sex offenders' register for six months after admitting to having sex with Matthew (left)

Mr Finnie asked that the CPO should continue but without further court appearances – a request granted by Sheriff Jamieson, who said: ‘I fixed this review to ensure that you were complying with it. It wasn’t meant to be an easy order to deal with.

‘I have two reports – one from the Community Payback team – which indicated that your compliance is exemplary as far as I can see.

‘You are engaging with the various services you were asked to engage with. The order will be allowed to continue.’

Sprung Dawson, who made no  comment last night, had driven to a layby with the teenager after a school Christmas dance last year, before having sex with him. The pair were discovered by patrolling police officers.

'Got away with it': Matthew's family said they feel Sprung Dawson, above, has not been punished for her crime

Sacked: Eppie Sprung Dawson lost her job as an English teacher at St Joseph's College in Dumfries, above, after being found to have had sex with 17-year-old student Matthew Robinson

At the initial court case in July, she admitted sexual activity with a person under 18 while she was his teacher and in a position of trust.

She was placed on the sex offenders’ register for six months and given a six-month CPO.

She lost her job at St Joseph’s College in Dumfries and split from her husband of two years, Ranald

Sprung Dawson, also a teacher and son of former Solicitor-General for Scotland, Lord Sprung Dawson.

A Dumfries and Galloway Council spokesman said: ‘The reports relating to a Community Payback Order are the property of the court. They are confidential and not in the  public domain. One of the reports was prepared by the criminal  justice social work department at Dumfries and Galloway Council.’

A spokesman at Dumfries Sheriff Court confirmed that Sprung Dawson did not have to carry out any work as part of her CPO but had to attend appointments with a doctor, psychiatrist or social worker.

Scottish Tory justice spokesman Margaret Mitchell said: ‘This woman has served her punishment as far as the law is concerned and will find the loss of her teaching career a far greater penalty.’
