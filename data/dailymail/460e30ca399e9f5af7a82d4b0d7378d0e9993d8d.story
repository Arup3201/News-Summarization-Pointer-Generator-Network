A century-old waterfront cottage on Sydney's northern beaches that had been handed down through the generations of one family has sold for a record price of $2.2 million.

Set on 367 square metres of land, the Carrington Parade property in Freshwater was last built in 1913 after the land was bought seven years earlier for 50 pounds and five shillings.

The three-bedroom timber home 'set a new land value record within the area' at Saturday's auction, estate agent James Smyth told Daily Mail Australia. The $2.2 million price tag surpassed its expected selling price of $1.85 million, he said.

A 101-year-old beach front cottage in Freshwater, New South Wales, was bought at auction for $2.2 million on Saturday

Set on 367 square metres of land, the property was last bought in 1906 for 50 pounds and five shillings

'You always get homes where it has been the same families living there for generations,' Mr Smyth, from Smyth Estate Agents said. 'I've had one that's stayed in the family for 75 years. 

'But this one had been in the one family, handed down from mother to daughter and then again to the most recent owner, for more than 101 years.' 

'There was a very small cottage put on it that took two years to be built, which was erected in 1913, and it's effectively the same one that is on there today.'

The property was put up for sale only after its former owner, Rita Edwards,  died  three weeks shy of her 100th birthday recently.

Rita, a German, was married twice before she  moved in to the property with her third husband David Edwards, whose mother was the original owner.

Rita was married to a Latvian who died in WWII - before she migrated to Australia in 1948 with her second husband Janis, before he died from stomach cancer just two months after they moved.

Rita's long-time neighbour  Gabriella Lang said this left Rita stranded in Australia 'without anything.'

'She had no money, no family, nothing,' Mrs Lang said.

Ms Edwards was 'a local character' who was 'a little wild in her older age', and very well loved in the community

But fortunately for Rita she married again for a third time, in 1951, and moved into the Carrington Parade property two years later with her husband David Edwards after his mother died. 

'David inherited the home after his mother died,' she said.  

Ms Edwards was 'a local character' who was 'a little wild in her older age', and very well loved in the community, Mr Smyth said. 

'Everyone was always aware of and checking in on her. She used to walk to Freshwater village on a daily basis for her 10:25am cup of tea and half a sausage roll,' he said.

Mrs Lang said she was a stubborn woman up until the day she died, refusing to move out of the water front home until last year when she was placed into a nursing home.

'Rita insisted on living there, she wasn't prepared to go in to a nursing home.'

But she eventually did, and it was at this point Ms Lang took legal responsibility of the property's affairs.

'She couldn't continue to live alone, so I officially managed her affairs when she went into the Austral house nursing home.' 

The property was put on the market soon after its former owner, Rita Edwards, died recently a few weeks short of her 100th birthday

The RSL Art Union Prize Home Lottery bought the property, and plans to redevelop it before offering it as a prize, the agent said

Rita died exactly a year to the day the property went to Auction on September 6, and had she had been alive, she would have been 100-years-old. 

The rustic home, featuring an outdoor toilet, was bought by the RSL Art Union Prize Home Lottery, a charity organisation that buys properties and offers them as lottery prizes in support of Australian war veterans.

'And I am pleased that the RSL bought it,' Mrs Lang said, keeping the land in the hands of a 'strong returned services connection.'

Laura and her husband were both in WWI, and Rita, being a German, lived through the second world war before she migrated to Australia.

The organisation plans to knock down the cottage and build a designer home in its place that will be offered as the first prize in a lottery to be held in the next 12 to 18 months, Mr Smyth said.

The perks of the property's cliff-top location were revealed to the eight registered bidders at Saturday's auction when they were distracted by the panoramic marine views - and some local marine wildlife.

'Right in the middle of the action there was a pod of five dolphins cruising right out the front of the house,' he said.

The sight of the dolphins distracted the whole crowd, including the auctioneer, who struggled to redirect people's attention back to the sale.'

The redeveloped property will be offered as a lottery prize in the next 12-18 months, the agent said

The auction was interrupted part-way through when a pod of dolphins swam by, catching the attention of the crowd
