Belgium captain Vincent Kompany has made a good recovery from the groin injury that plagued him before Tuesday's World Cup win over USA, coach Marc Wilmots said on Thursday.

The news will come as much relief to the Belgians, who face Argentina in the quarter-finals in Brasilia on Saturday.

'He looks to have made a very good recovery,' said Wilmots of his key centre back who missed Belgium's last group game against South Korea and was unable to train before their 2-1 extra-time win over America in Salvador.

Kompany managed to get through the last-16 drama at the Fonte Nova arena but at times seemed bothered by the injury.

Speaking after the match Wilmots was not sure if the injury had flared up but two days on has told reporters Kompany was on track to feature in the quarter-finals.

Thomas Vermaelen, who missed the match against the U.S with a hamstring injury, trained for a second successive day on Thursday and will come back into selection contention.

Wilmots said two other defenders, Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld, were struggling with small niggles.

'That stands to reason after the exertions against the U.S. But our medical staff have done an outstanding job and will sort it out,' he said.
