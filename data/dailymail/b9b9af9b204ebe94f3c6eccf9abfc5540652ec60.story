Progress has been made on the investigation into Brendan Hickey's death at Sydney's Darling Harbour late Friday night.

Police were able to confirm this morning that the tragic drowning of the 34-year-old was indeed an accident.

The Irishman, who lived in Randwick, was believed to be under the influence of alcohol while sitting with a group of friends on the edge of a wooden pier to watch Sydney's Vivid light festival.

Police have confirmed that Brendan Hickey, 34, accidentally fell into Sydney's Darling Harbour on Friday before 11pm

'He stood up, lost his balance and accidentally fell in,' Marine Area Command's acting superintendent Joe McNulty told the MailOnline.

Police are investigating Brendan's level of sobriety after witnesses alleged that he had consumed alcohol.

'We're also examining whether other substances were involved,' acting superintendent McNulty said.

An autopsy is expected to be conducted on Monday morning.

While a family member told Nine News that Brendan couldn't swim, acting superintendent McNulty said this hasn't been confirmed.

Police are yet to interview his friends and brother Shane, who also resides in Sydney, as they are currently grieving.

Since Brendan's death, friends and family have taken to social media to express their condolences for the Irish 'gentleman'.

'My thoughts are with you and your family... Bren was one of the greatest guys u knew, I'm devastated.'

Marianne Hickey wrote: 'So sorry Shane. I have no words. I'm thinking of u cuz....il c u soon xxxxxx'

'Thinking of you and all the family! He was an absolute gentleman!,' Adrian McGeown said.

A woman who appears in numerous photos with Brendan on his Facebook page, Julia Szymanska, 22, has also posted a tribute photo of her and him together, on Saturday.

Witnesses watched the tragedy unfold on the opening night of the Vivid Sydney light show as one of Brendan's female friends and another man dove into the water fully clothed in a desperate bid to rescue him.

They were unsuccessful in locating their friend and emerged from the water unharmed.

Police recovered Brendan's body about three metres out from the boardwalk at Cockle Bay Wharf at 1.30am on Saturday.

'We saw the girl jump off the police boat first then another guy jumped in after her,' a shocked onlooker, Mark Jacoub, said.

'They were in the water for less than 40 seconds.'

Witnesses said security men then came over to tell the two friends to get out of the water without realising what had just happened.
