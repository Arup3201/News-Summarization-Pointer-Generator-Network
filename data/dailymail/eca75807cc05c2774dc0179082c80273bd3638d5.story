Internationally renowned Australian author Colleen McCullough has died at the age of 77 after an impressive 40 years of writing.

McCullough, best loved for her immensely popular novel The Thorn Birds, died in Norfolk Island Hospital on Thursday afternoon after enduring a string of health problems.

The best-selling author penned 24 novels and a biography, earning McCullough a global reputation and inspiring a portrait that was a finalist for the 2007 Archibald Prize.

McCullough was born in Wellington, NSW, and worked as a teacher, librarian, and journalist before entering the field of medicine and working as a neuroscientist in the United States. 

She studied neurophysiology at the University of Sydney, and would go on to establish a department for the field at the university, running it for five years, reported The Australian.

Her work was of such a high calibre that she was invited to run the research laboratory in the medical school at Yale University.

After the publication of The Thorn Birds in 1977, McCullough turned to writing fulltime, moving to the isolated Norfolk Island, where she met and married her husband Ric Robinson. 

The success of The Thorn Birds, whose book rights were worth a cool $1.9 million for the paperback alone, evolved into a mini-series adaptation of the novel starring Richard Chamberlain, Bryan Brown and Rachel Ward.

Colleen McCullough's The Thorn Birds was made into a mini series after selling 30 million copies

The novel, which sold more than 30 million copies worldwide, is set on a sheep station in the Australian outback, and details the struggle of a young priest who is torn between his desire for the woman he loves and his clerical calling.

Mel Gibson and Piper Laurie starred in a film adaptation of another of McCullough's books, Tim. 

McCullough also wrote many other well-known books including An Indecent Obsession, Morgan's Run, The Touch, and the Masters of Rome series.

The series, which involved extensive research, won her praise from ancient history scholars and book lovers alike.

'Nobody had ever written a big book about Caesar, ever,' she told news.com.au at the time of it's publication.

'I soon found out why, because the research was so fearsome. I thought, oh, good,' McCullough said.

In 2000 she was awarded the Scanno Prize for literature in Italy, despite some literary critics panning her accessible books as low-brow writing. 

Her 2008 novel The Independence of Miss Mary Bennett was a reinterpretation of Jane Austen's classic Pride and Prejudice, garnering controversy among some literary circles.

The president of the Jane Austen Society of Australia, Susannah Fullerton, said that McCullough's portrayal of Elizabeth Bennett as weak, and Mr Darcy as 'savage' made her 'shudder'.

McCullough published her final novel, Bittersweet, which was set in the 1920's and 30's, in 2013.

HarperCollins publishing director Shona Martyn said that McCullough was a 'less colourful place' without her.

'Ever quick-witted and direct, we looked forward to her visits from Norfolk Island and the arrival of each new manuscript delivered in hard copy in custom-made maroon manuscript boxes inscribed with her name,' Ms Martyn told SBS.
