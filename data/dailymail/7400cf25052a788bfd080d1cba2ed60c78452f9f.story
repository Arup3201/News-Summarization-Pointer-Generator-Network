A heavily pregnant woman and her seven-year-old son have been found shot dead at a home in rural Queensland alongside the body of a 52-year-old male relative in an apparent murder-suicide. 

Police believe the father's death is not suspicious, while his 27-year-old daughter and her son's death are being treated as suspicious. 

Three gunshots were heard coming from the home on Sunday night at around 10.30pm but police were not called to the scene until Monday evening.

'There was one shot and then some time difference between the second shot,' Detective Inspector David Isherwood said. 

The man's other daughter reportedly discovered all three bodies at the home in Biddeston, in the Toowoomba Region, on Monday at around 6.45pm when she came to the house to pick up some belongings and to see their pet dogs.

Detective Inspector David Isherwood said that investigations indicate that there is no further threat to public safety.

'This is a terrible situation that has claimed the lives of a woman and her son.

'I must stress that we are in the early stages of our investigation however it would appear that two of the deaths are suspicious and the death of the man is non suspicious,' he said. 

DI Isherwood said really close members of the family haven't been able to be contacted yet.

The person who found the bodies had to climb through a window to gain access to the house.

'Two people that live in the town heard three distinct gunshots,' DI Isherwood said.

'There is no evidence that the house has been broken into when the police arrived they had to force entry into the premises. It would appear that the house was secure. The first person who attended the residence had to climb in to gain entry.'
