They say imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, but for Kari Anderson, 42, it could have been deadly. 

The former model from Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, was almost left paralysed after a jealous neighbour laid a tripwire outside her door, sending her hurtling down two flights of stairs. 

The trap was the climax to a bizarre sequence of events, which included Kari's next door neighbour Janet Pearson changing her appearance and dress style to seemingly look like her.  

Kari Anderson, 42, from Lancashire, suffered a string of bizarre incidents with jealous neighbour Janet Pearson, that culminated in Janet leaving a tripwire at the top of the stairs. The trap sent Kari hurtling down two flights and left her with serious bruising and a brokwn

Then in January 2014, Kari tripped over the wire as she walked out of her apartment, suffering severe injuries to her face, wrist, neck and back.

Her neighbour Janet was convicted last month of setting the tripwire and will be sentenced on February 5. 

Kari also describes how Pearson would sit at an upstairs window - overlooking the driveway - and watch Kari as she went about her daily affairs.

Kari, a 42 year old law graduate and former model, said: 'At first I was quite flattered that she wanted to look like me, but then it became creepy.

'It was unnerving. I started to worry that she was jealous of me - or even infatuated in some way.

'But I could never have foreseen what she did next.

Kari Anderson now runs a property business but used to work as a model 

'What upsets me most is that she was inside her flat as I went bumping down the stairs; she must have heard me screaming for help, and yet she ignored me.

'I could have died that day.'

Kari, who runs a property business, bought her luxury penthouse next door to Pearson's one-bedroom flat in upmarket Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, 15 years ago. 

She began living there herself two years ago, along with her 25-year-old son, Stephen.

Kari said: 'When I had first met Janet she seemed nice, there was no problem. But after I moved in there, she had just split with her long-term partner and was really quite upset.

'She then had a knee operation, and she piled on weight, going from a size 12 to a size 20.

'Maybe she felt like life was going against her, because she seemed quite bitter.

'Whenever I came home from holiday she would say: "It's all right for some."

'I got the impression she was jealous.

'But I have worked very hard for what I have. Janet has never had a job as long as I've known her. She had no reason to resent me at all.'

A few months on, Kari noticed that Janet was beginning to change her hair and dress style.

She said: 'Janet had brown hair but she had it coloured blonde, like mine. Then, she got hair extensions, so that it was the same length as mine.

'I always wear leggings and the same make of boots - and Janet started to do the same, which was completely different to her usual style.

'At first, I suppose I felt a bit flattered, though I couldn't see why she would want to copy me. But then, it began to freak me out.

'One day I bumped into her and she was wearing the exact same shade of orange lipstick which I wear every day. It was creepy.

'I began to wonder whether she was obsessed with me in some way. It was like the film Single White Female.'

To add to Kari's concerns, Janet would spend most of her time sitting at a window which overlooked their shared driveway.

Kari sa: 'At first, I'd spot her and wave. I didn't think anything of it. But then, I noticed that whatever time I came home, Janet was there.

'Sometimes, I'd come home from work at 1am or 2am - and she was watching me.

'As I was unlocking my front door, she would come out. If I had been somewhere nice, perhaps on holiday, she'd make a nasty comment as if she was jealous.'

Kari also noticed that large amounts of her mail were going missing, including bank statements and business letters, from the shared letterbox in the apartment complex.

She sa: 'At first I blamed my son, thinking he was losing it. I went to the sorting office and complained to them. I even called the police.

'I had no proof where the mail had gone.

'The police said the easiest thing would be to get my own locked letter box, and after that, the problem was solved.'

In October 2013, Kari paid a tradesman £800 to build a large storage cupboard outside her apartment. But when she came to use it, shortly afterwards, she found it full of Janet's belongings.

Kari says: 'I couldn't believe it. The cupboard was full of unopened disability aids, which Janet had been given by social services, but didn't use.'

The wire at the top of the stairs that caused Kari to fall. She took the picture with her mobile phone after dragging herself back up

She continued: 'I asked her politely to take them out but she refused. I told her that if she didn't move them, I would. We didn't have a huge argument but we certainly exchanged words.' 

Kari says: 'Looking back, the tension was building. She watched me and my son enjoy a family Christmas and then we went on holiday.

'For some twisted reason, I think she resented me.'

Days later, in January 2014, Janet set the tripwire which was to bring the whole saga to a horrific end.

Kari says: 'I often get up early for work and on this particular day, I was ready to leave at 5am, with my overnight bag in one hand and a bin-bag in the other.

'The stairway in the hall was unusually dark as we were waiting for an electrician to fix the lights.'

As Kari reached the top stair, she felt something sharp on her shin and she hurtled headlong down two flights of stairs.

She says: 'Instinctively, I put my hands out and my face smashed against the wall as my wrist was bent backwards.

'I landed upside down, and the pain was horrendous. I was convinced I had broken my neck.

'My brother broke his neck as a teenager, and all I could think of was that the same had happened to me, and of how my poor mum would cope.

'I could taste blood. It was running down my face and in my hair.

'I was screaming for help and sobbing loudly, but nobody came. I was so disorientated, I couldn't even remember whether my son had come home the night before or if he was at his girlfriend's.'

Realising that help might be hours away, Kari dragged herself back up the stairs, in excruciating pain, and found her mobile phone - smashed but still working - along the way.

It was then, with the light of the phone, that she saw the tripwire.

She says: 'I was anxious to see what had caused my fall. I thought maybe a banister had fallen out or a carpet rod had come loose.

'But then I saw the wire, wrapped several times around the banister to make it absolutely tight - and the other end disappeared inside Janet's flat.

In horror, Kari went back inside her own apartment, where her screams awoke her son.

Kari likened her situation with her next door neighbour to the film Single White Female, starring Jennifer Jason Leigh and Bridge Fonda (pictured). In the movie, a woman tries to find fulfillment by trying become her successful roommate

She says: 'When my son realised what had happened he rushed down and took photos of the tripwire.

'But in-between then - and the sound of the sirens approaching - the tripwire was removed.'

Kari was taken to hospital with injuries to her face, neck, back and wrist. Pearson was arrested but denied the offence.

She was bailed and allowed to return to her flat, next door to Kari.

Kari says: 'There was no remorse at all. If anything, as she saw me struggling with my injuries, she looked rather smug.'

Janet Pearson appeared before Preston Crown Court in December 2014 and was convicted of assault causing actual bodily harm. She is awaiting sentence.

Kari says: 'I am still suffering the effects of what she did. I have terrible headaches and have damage to the upper part of my spine.

'My right wrist is also badly injured, which means I've had to give up painting; a hobby I used to love.'

After the incicent, Kari was taken to hospital with injuries to her face, neck, back and wrist

She continued: 'I ask myself constantly why she would do such a wicked thing. We'd had a couple of minor disagreements, but there was nothing to suggest this.

'She must have heard me as I fell down the stairs - I bumped along her lounge wall. 

'She must have heard me screaming and pleading for help, yet she did nothing.

'I could drive myself mad with trying to understand what happened but I'm a survivor and a fighter, and I will bounce back from this.

'Janet has slowed me down, but she won't beat me. I only hope the courts give her the punishment she truly deserves.'
