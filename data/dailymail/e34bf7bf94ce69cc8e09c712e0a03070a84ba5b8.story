An ancient British tumble dryer running for over three decades is still going strong.

When Howard Lunn's old Creda model finally let him down he feared the worst in trying to get a replacement part for the relic.

Instead Indesit, which now owns the brand, found him the desired spare and even fitted it free of charge in recognition of his machine's unusual longevity.

Tough tumbler: Howard Lunn's ancient British tumble dryer is still going strong after three decades

Mr Lunn of Bishopsteignton, Devon, thought the old machine had dried its last batch of laundry when the drum's drive belt gave up the ghost.

'I could not find a spare online because our model is long since out of production,' he explained.

'But when I got through to Indesit customer services they were able to source what they thought might be an equivalent part.

'Not only that, but they offered a complimentary visit by their engineer lan VVallis, who worked as an engineer in the very same factory where the appliance was made in Staffordshire before he moved to Devon.'

Mr Lunn, who bought his hardy Creda in Bedford more than 30 years ago before moving to Bishopsteignton, said: 'The machine was definitely built to last - and made in England, too.

'It's a proper job, as they say down here.'
