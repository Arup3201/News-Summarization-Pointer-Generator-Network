PC Neil Doyle, an off-duty police officer, was murdered on a night out with his colleagues

A European arrest warrant has been issued for a man wanted in connection with the murder of off-duty police officer PC Neil Doyle. 

The third suspect in the hunt for the killers of the police officer was today named as Timmy Donovan, 30. 

Detectives believe Donovan - who also goes by the surname O'Sullivan - left the country on the same day as PC Doyle's death.  

It is thought he was driving a five-door grey Mercedes A180 - registration YE62 NWG - which passed through the Eurotunnel at about 8.30pm on Friday December 19. 

Officers are working with the National Crime Agency, Europol and European police forces to try and locate Donovan. 

He is understood to be in Europe, possibly Spain. 

He is described as 5ft 8in tall, broad build, with dark brown hair and blue eyes and has a Liverpool accent. 

Donovan is originally from the Huyton area of Merseyside and has connections with Childwall in Liverpool.

PC Neil Doyle, a 36-year-old beat bobby, was set upon in the early hours of Friday December 19 in Colquitt Street, central Liverpool, in what his boss described as an unprovoked and vicious attack.

He was out in the city following a Christmas night out with two other off-duty officers Michael Steventon and Robert Marshall, when they were attacked at around 3.15am.

His colleagues were treated in hospital for facial injuries. 

The attackers vanished when it became clear that PC Doyle was seriously hurt. 

Officers and bouncers from a nearby club tried to revive him before paramedics arrived.

A post-mortem examination concluded that PC Doyle died from a fatal bleed around the brain.

The fight, which involved no weapons, broke out in Colquitt Street, central Liverpool, at 3.15am on Friday December 19 following the officers' Christmas party at a pub - police are now hunting a third suspect

Mr Doyle married only five months ago and he and wife Sarah, 37, had booked a belated honeymoon for the new year. 

The couple were married in July and were due to go on their honeymoon next month.

Following his death in hospital, his widow Sarah said in a statement: 'Neil was very well loved by all of his family, friends and colleagues and it is a great loss to us all.

'We are finding it extremely difficult to come to terms with what has happened and need time to be left to grieve.' 

Two former non league footballers, Andrew Taylor, 28, and Christopher Spendlove, 30, are accused of his murder. 

Taylor, of Huyton, and Spendlove, of Stockbridge Village, are currently in custody.

They also face charges of unlawfully and maliciously wounding officers Michael Steventon and Robert Marshall during the same incident.

They will next appear in court on March 20 for a plea hearing. A provisional trial date has been set for June 22. 

Police said previously that it appeared the attackers knew their victims were off-duty police officers. 

Officers are appealing to Timmy Donovan, or anyone who knows of his whereabouts, to contact the Matrix Serious Organised Crime Major Crime Unit on 0800 230 0600, or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
