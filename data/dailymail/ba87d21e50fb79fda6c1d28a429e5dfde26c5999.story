David Cameron was last night urged to stand up to the ‘militant atheists’ who want to deny Britain’s Christian heritage.

Leaders of many faiths backed the Prime Minister’s decision to talk openly about his beliefs after it was criticised in a letter by non-believers.

MPs also said he must not allow himself to be shouted down by ‘aggressive’ atheists who want faith to be cut out of politics and national life.

David Cameron faced criticism after calling Britain a Christian country but faith leaders and his own MPs have rallied around him in support

The Prime Minister came under fire after a group of celebrity atheists said he was wrong to declare Britain a ‘Christian country’. Their open letter said Britain is not a ‘Christian country’ and argued that most members of the public ‘do not want religions or religious identities to be actively prioritised by their elected government’. The letter, signed by more than 50 celebrities, scientists and academics, including the authors Philip Pullman and Sir Terry Pratchett and TV presenter Nick Ross, also accused the PM of sowing ‘alienation and division’ and fuelling ‘sectarian divides’. But the claims were rubbished by MPs along with British faith leaders from the Christian, Muslim, Hindu and Sikh communities yesterday.

Senior Tory Gary Streeter, chairman of the cross-party group Christians in Parliament, urged the PM to face down his atheist critics. He said: ‘These people say it is offensive to say Britain is a Christian country, but offensive to who? Other religious groups welcome the fact we are talking about faith.’

Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, said that to claim Britain was not a Christian country was to ‘ignore historical and constitutional reality’.

Here are some of the 55 public figures who signed a letter accusing David Cameron of fostering ‘alienation’ by emphasising Christianity

PHILIP PULLMANThe author, pictured, received hate mail for his book, The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ but said he was ‘trying to undermine the basis of Christian belief’.

NICK ROSSThe former Crimewatch presenter is said to believe that religion has ‘enslaved and crushed as many as it has enlightened’.

SIR TERRY PRATCHETTNow suffering from Alzheimer’s, the author supports legalising assisted death, but his documentary on the subject was criticised by religious leaders as ‘propaganda’.

JIM AL-KHALILIThe letter’s lead signatory, the Iraqi born physicist and author is current president of the British Humanist Association.

A.C. GRAYLING Philosopher, atheist and author of The Good Book - which has been described as ‘a secular bible’.

STEVE JONESA geneticist, former head of the Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment at University College London and member of British Humanist Association.

DAN SNOWThe television historian was married by The Bishop of Liverpool, James Jones, in 2012 – but said he was allowed to ‘take God out of my vows’.

He said: ‘Where do David Cameron’s critics think our constitution, ethics and establishment come from?’

He added that as a Christian country, Britain had ‘ensured the freedom of all religious and non-religious voices to be heard’ whereas a secularist establishment would ‘inhibit’ them.

He compared Britain to France, where ‘secularism in practice’ has seen the ‘illiberal banning of some forms of religious dress and the suppression of religious voices in public debate’.

Farooq Murad, of the Muslim Council of Great Britain, said: ‘No one can deny that Britain remains largely a Christian country, with deep historical and structural links with the established Church. The 2011 census indicates that more than 60 per cent of the English self-identify as Christian. We respect that.’

Lord Indarjit Singh, of the Network of Sikh Organisations, said: ‘Christianity is the religion of the majority. It is not the greatest sin to say this. What is of greater concern is the letter in response, which says we are not a religious country.’

Anil Bhanot, of the Hindu Council UK, said he was ‘grateful’ for Christianity’s inclusive attitude towards other religions and pointed out that many British Hindus even celebrated Christian holidays.

‘I attend the Commonwealth service at Westminster Abbey each year,’ he added. ‘I gave my nieces and family Easter eggs on Saturday. Many Hindus celebrate Christmas, although they do not go to church, because they are living in Britain. As long as religion is not imposed there is no problem.’ In 2008, Mr Cameron likened his faith to the reception of radio station Magic FM in the Chilterns, saying it ‘comes and goes’.

But earlier this week, he said that he believed Britain should be more ‘evangelical’ about Christianity and ‘more confident about our status as a Christian country’. In an article for the Church Times, he argued that some atheists and agnostics did not understand that faith could be a ‘guide or a helpful prod’  towards morality.

It was this intervention that prompted yesterday’s letter – signed by 55 atheist public figures – denouncing his language and accusing him of ‘fostering alienation and division’.

Tony Blair’s former spin doctor Alastair Campbell went further by suggesting that Mr Cameron was faking the extent of his religious belief in a cynical ‘tactic’ to distract attention away from the resignation of Culture Secretary Maria Miller.

Mr Campbell – who famously barred journalists from asking Mr Blair about his faith – said: ‘Like so much of what he does it feels like a tactic in search of a strategy.’

But Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said Mr Cameron was ‘brave’ to take on the atheists.

‘The extreme secularists are an aggressive and unpleasant lobby and they have a degree of self-righteousness that the Pharisees would be proud of,’ he said.

‘They are not representative. People have in their hearts a fundamental belief in God in surprisingly large numbers.’

Downing Street said Mr Cameron had made clear as far back as 2011 that he believed the UK was a Christian country ‘and should not be afraid to say so’.

‘He also added that this was not to say in any way that to have another faith – or no faith – was somehow wrong,’ a spokesman said.
