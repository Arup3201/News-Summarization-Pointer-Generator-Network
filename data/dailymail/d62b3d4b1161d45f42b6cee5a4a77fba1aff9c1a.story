New York's Uber drivers will soon be allowed to turn their black cars into yellow cabs.

The Taxi and Limousine Commission have approved a pilot program that will let up to 400 drivers convert any TLC car less than two years old into a yellow taxi. 

The move comes after a number of yellow cabbies who had painted their cars black in order to work for Uber are now regretting making the switch.

The city hopes the program will bring down expenses for drivers, as well as make it easier for hacks to switch from working in one part of the industry to another.

Like regular taxi cabs, the drivers would still need to lease a cab medallion, which costs about $120 a day, before hitting the road. 

'We're hoping to make it easier for drivers to move between segments and maximize their economic opportunities,' said TLC spokesman Allan Fromberg to the New York Post.

Uber has also given its support to the program. 

'Anything that opens up more opportunities for drivers, as the Uber app did three years ago, is great for riders and great for cities,' said spokesman Matt Wing.

A number of yellow cab drivers were lured to Uber because of the freedom the company supposedly offers with the ability for drivers to pick and choose when they want to work.

Not so hot: Uber is disputing claims drivers are leaving en masse, pointing to company surveys that claim its New York drivers make around $30 an hour, which they say is twice what yellow cab drivers earn

Regular taxi drivers have to lease their cars from a garage by the shift or by the week. However, often they are locked into multi-year contracts, making it very difficult to make a move. This new program will allow drivers to pick and choose.

However, a number of cabbies are disenchanted with Uber, which often runs promotions guaranteeing new drivers as much as $10,000 a month for a limited time if they make the switch.

'I've spoken to many cab drivers who have left say who say they weren't happy with the money they were making, and the leasing arrangements with their cars,' Michael Woloz, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Taxi Cab Board of Trade, which reps medallion owners told the Daily News. 

Crossover: The new pilot program marks the first time in nearly 20 years that the city has allowed drivers to use previously owned cars as yellow cabs

'They're coming to the garages, and saying they want to come back.'

Uber disputes claims  drivers are leaving en masse pointing out that drivers can earn $30 an hour in New York which is double that earned by those driving yellow cabs. 

Under the new rules, cars on the TLC's list of approved vehicles - including the Toyota Camry, Ford Taurus, and Chevrolet Impala - can be repurposed into yellow cabs, complete with a meter. 

Drivers must have a valid TLC taxi driving license, and the car must have been previously used as a for-hire vehicle.
