Every young boy dreams of attending a baseball game and their dad catching a foul ball or homer so they’ve got a souvenir from the big day to take home.

Unfortunately that’s not how this particular father/son bonding experience played out at Sunday’s Giants game in San Francisco.

With the foul ball flying towards them, pop did his best to make his boy proud, but sadly misses the catch and junior’s dream are dashed.

Daddy disappointment: With the baseball coming straight at him, the young boy's father still manages to miss the catch

A more mature young man might have masked his feelings better, but this young boy doesn't control his emotions and makes his disappointment felt by promptly having a temper tantrum on the spot.

The young boy punches his father several times as he makes his frustration known at the realization that his dad can’t catch.

Since he was actually wearing a catcher’s glove, maybe the boy was telling his father that next time he should leave the ball to him.

Let’s face it the young boy couldn’t have done any worse.
