Busted: After being cleared of any involvement in the bomb hoax Christopher Shell was arrested on outstanding warrants for drugs charges

A 29-year-old bomb hoax victim was arrested on Thursday, hours after being led from an aircraft in handcuffs, then released, over a phoney tip-off he was carrying a bomb.

Christopher Shell was believed to be the victim of a 'nasty prank' at the hands of his ex-girlfriend after the allegations forced the US Airways plane he was on to do a u-turn en route from Philadelphia to Dallas, Texas.

But later that day he found himself back in police custody on outstanding drug warrants held for two drug-possession charges — less than 2 ounces of marijuana and less than 28 grams of a controlled substance.

He was jailed on Friday morning on $3,000 bond in Collin County near Dallas.

26-year-old Kenneth W. Smith Jr. has since been arrested, accused of making the hoax threat. He has been charged with conveying false and misleading information.

Police
were led to Smith by Shell who, during questioning, told authorities of
a feud involving him, his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend 'Kenny'.

He said he had recently traded 'hostile messages' on his cellphone with his ex-girlfriend about the situation.

Shell
gave officers the name of Smith's workplace, where he was questioned. 
Authorities said Smith admitted he made the call from a payphone to 
'avenge' the ex-girlfriend, because Shell had posted a compromising 
picture of her on Facebook.

He was scheduled for an initial 
appearance in federal court on Friday afternoon. If convicted, he faces a
maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000 and 
possible restitution.

As the investigation continues Smith is due for an initial apprentice in federal court on Friday afternoon.

Emergency u-turn: Christopher Shell was removed from the craft while it was searched

If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000 and possible restitution.

The drama began for Shell as he celebrated his 29th birthday on board the aircraft.

He and his fellow passengers about a third of the way into the flight when the anonymous tipster called airport police, at around 7.30am, claiming he was carrying 'dangerous substances'.

At first believed to be a 
birthday prank, police and the airline nonetheless took the allegation 
seriously and re-routed the plane, sending it back to Philadelphia 
International Airport, half an hour into the journey.

The plane returned to Philadelphia where it was met by a slew of law enforcement vehicles and personnel.

Passenger Steve McNeal said he was sitting next to Shell when five heavily armed officials boarded the plane.

'They
turned the gun and pointed it at the guy sitting right next to me. I 
was shocked,' McNeal said after the flight eventually made its way to 
Dallas.

'I had been talking to him on the way out for the first 15 minutes of the flight. Nothing seemed abnormal.'

Rant: Shell moaned about the flight on Facebook

Another passenger, Lisa Flanagan, 
from Philadelphia, said it looked as though Shell 'was in shock. He 
didn't know what was going on.'

Shell was led from the jet wearing 
handcuffs after the craft made return to Philadelphia 
International Airport. He was put him in the back of a police car and 
taken off for questioning, apparently very surprised to be caught up in 
the midst of the emergency.

'He was obviously very alarmed, as I would be if heavily armed police officers entered a plane to take me off,' Philadelphia police Chief Inspector Joseph 
Sullivan said.

'And he was certainly stunned. And that's why this is no joke, this is no laughing matter.'

Bomb technicians and specially trained dogs searched the plane but found nothing illegal or hazardous, Sullivan said.

Police believe the scare was a practical joke, played on Shell as he celebrated his 29th birthday, NBC reported.

Shell did nothing wrong and was the victim of 'a pretty nasty trick,' Sullivan said.

He made a swift recovery, however, taking to Facebook to offer up his story in exchange for cash.

'If u have questions or want an interview with me, it will cost u $$$ until then,' he wrote. 'Sry. Message me your offers as I'll go with the most $$$!'

Earlier on he had posted: 'Im not going to lie, I'm pretty disappointed in US Airways currently. We just spent a half hour in the air to be notified that the plane, "has technical difficulties" and had to fly back! Flight 1267 CANCELLED. Gay!'

Sullivan stressed that Shell is not a suspect but added that police are treating the hoax seriously because it had resulted in a heavy police response and a significant hassle for all those on board, he said.

'It's just an incredibly foolish and irresponsible thing to do and, bottom line, it's criminal,' Sullivan said.

Two people have since been taken into custody for questioning, according to NBC.

Earlier, an FBI spokesman said the flight was diverted because of a call reporting liquid explosives were on board. Sullivan declined to discuss the content of the call.

A pre-departure Facebook post from Shell described how someone he knew at the airport allowed him to go 'through security with a breeze'. Sullivan said social media posts would be part of the investigation.

Shell's hometown is Fort Worth, and he works in Philadelphia for 2020 Companies, a sales and marketing firm, according to his Facebook page. Various posts and public records indicate he turned 29 on Thursday and planned to spend the weekend in Texas.

Police in Fort Worth and nearby Dallas didn't immediately return messages from the AP seeking information about the Texas arrest, and a local FBI spokeswoman said the arrest wasn't an FBI matter. Shell isn't listed in online records for the jails serving either city.

FBI special agent Richard Quinn said it was too early to speculate about what sort of charges could be filed against the caller but they could be severe.

McNeal, who was sitting next to Shell, said he hopes whoever made the call 'pays for it'.

'Because in this day and age,' he said, 'it's not funny.'

The airplane had 69 passengers and five crew members on board, airport spokeswoman Victoria Lupica said.
