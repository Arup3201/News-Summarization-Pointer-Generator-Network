Three out of four of the UK’s 50 million easy access savings accounts now earn less than the Bank of England’s historically low base rate of 0.5 per cent.

A report by the Financial Conduct Authority found that more than £160 billion is languishing in low-interest savings accounts.

And five million people with more than £5,000 in easy access accounts – from which cash withdrawals can be made – could have made up to £650 million more in interest last year if they had switched to accounts with higher rates.

It warned that banks are still making it too hard for customers to see what interest rates they are getting, or to switch to a rival.

This has stifled competition and kept interest rates even lower, when savers are already suffering the worst returns on record.

In its report, the watchdog found that despite offering lower-than-average interest rates, the biggest four providers – HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds and RBS – continued to attract the most savings, with those who had accounts opened five years ago or more suffering the worst returns.

Interest rates have plunged to their lowest level in 15 years, according to official figures, with fixed-term accounts attracting an average of just 1.8 per cent – dropping to a tiny 0.76 per cent for easy access savings.

Experts say it is a desperate time for savers, as the Bank of England’s base rate has been at 0.5 per cent since March 2009, and it is not expected to raise rates until at least the end of this year.

In order to ease the misery of savers, the FCA said providers should be more transparent about reductions on interest rates and make it easier for customers to shop around.

To make this happen, banks have been told they must clearly display the lowest rate of interest customers are receiving in all communications.

It also suggested banks should send savers a regular statement which detailed how good – or bad – their interest rate was compared to others on the market.

But the watchdog stopped short of banning controversial teaser rates, which offer high interest rates for a short time to lure new savers in before dropping them a little while later.

A British Bankers’ Association spokesman said: ‘The FCA’s report identifies a number of proposed remedies which have the potential to make life even easier for customers and we will consider these carefully.’
