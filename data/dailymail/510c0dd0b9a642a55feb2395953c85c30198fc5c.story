Thousands of people gathered in a small Texas town this weekend to watch rattlesnakes get cleaned, skinned, milked and more - some visitors even left their mark on the wall with bloody hand prints.

The Annual Sweetwater Jaycee’s World’s Largest Rattlesnake Roundup hosts hunts, beauty and eating contests, demonstrations, vendors selling snake-skin products and more. Attendees could even buy fried rattlesnake, which apparently takes like chicken.

Before the snakes are cooked, however, they are passed through an assembly line, where they are killed, decapitated, then cleaned and skinned as they hang from a wire.

The roundup, which has been going on since 1958 and is the oldest and grandest in Texas, began to control the population of rattlesnakes in the area, according to the Odessa American, but now more people are drawn to the sheer awe of the event.

The four-day event takes place in Sweetwater's Nolan County Coliseum, which is also used for the county fair, rodeos and other large events in the area. 

The event brings more than $2million into Sweetwater - a town with a population of 11,400 - and proceeds go toward community projects, youth sports and helping the disabled and disadvantaged.

A hunt for snakes starts about a month before the roundup, and hunters are able to harvest about 5,000 pounds of snakes - which averages out into about 1,000 snakes.

Hunters use a gassing technique, where they spray gasoline through copper tubes to lure the snakes from their hiding places.

But the gassing method is controversial in Texas, as people fear it hurts other animals and habitats, and could be facing a ban, leaving an uncertain future for the roundup.

Hunters use the gasoline to hunt in large volume in colder, wetter weather. If gassing is banned, they will potentially have to postpone the roundup.

Though the Texas Wildlife Department has been looking into gassing for years and nearly banned it in 2013, the organization delayed making a decision until September so Sweetwater representatives and researchers could propose an alternative solution.

Some opponents to the Roundup are concerned with the treatment and slaying of the rattlesnakes and suggested a no-kill roundup.

Jaycees, however, told the Odessa American that it would be irresponsible to release such a dangerous creature back into the area after capturing it.

Sweetwater Jaycees say that the the roundup harvests about 5,000lb of snakes each year, which serves as a form of population control. The venom from the snakes is sold to an Alabama pharmaceutical company
