LAURA WILLIAMSON

My favourite memory

Scotland’s Lynsey Sharp won 800m silver after spending most of the previous night in hospital on a  drip and throwing up. ‘This is my everything,’ she said afterwards.

Thumbs up for...

The athletes who came, fought and proved the doubters wrong. Greg Rutherford, Louis Smith and Sally Pearson among them. Don’t tell them these Games don’t matter.

Thumbs down for...

England’s netball team, beaten by Australia and New Zealand by a  single goal and then losing the bronze medal to Jamaica. This was their time and they blew it.

Dejected: England's netball team during their bronze-medal match defeat to Jamaica

Ecstasy: Jamaica celebrate winning the bronze medal at the Commonwealth Games

Funniest moment

Rwandan Robert Bagina trying to outsprint Olympic champion David Rudisha over the first lap of their 800m heat and then dipping on the line with his arms out - in a very distant sixth place.

My unlikely hero

Mother-of-two Jo Pavey winning 5,000m bronze at the age of 40. 

Brit to watch in Rio

Jodie Williams who at 20 won 200m silver in the second fastest time by a British woman.

The Games in three words...

No more bowls.

One to watch: Jodie Williams 200m time was the second fastest ever run by a British woman

JONATHAN McEVOY

My favourite memory

Watching the triathlete Brownlee brothers, Alistair and Jonny, in the most brutal of  internecine contests. 

Thumbs up for...

Glasgow not sticking up prices on food and drink as ludicrously as most other, more rapacious events.

Thumbs down for...

The security man who ripped my accreditation pass off for doing my job - speaking to Usain Bolt. He was told off, I believe, and advised that I would have left without being manhandled if he had asked politely.

Double act: Alistair Brownlee (right) leads his brother Jonny during the Triathlon final

Top two: Alistair Brownlee claimed golf in the triathlon as brother Jonathan finished second

Funniest moment 

Alex Salmond imposing a ‘self-denying ordinance’ on the independence debate and in the same breath poking fun at George Osborne.

My unlikely heroes

The limousine drivers who took us from Hampden to our hotel, even though we were not eligible for such VIP treatment.

Brit to watch in Rio

Gymnast Claudia Fragapane, only 4ft 6in, who won four gold medals at just 16. Her floor routines dazzle.

The Games in three words...

Rebuke to modernity.

NICK HARRIS

My favourite memory

An Australian swimmer’s family being lauded on a train by a  well-refreshed Glasgwegian, who led the carriage in a round of applause.

Thumbs up for...

Britain’s gymnasts, including  England’s Claudia Fragapane, Nile Wilson and ‘veteran’ Max Whitlock (21) plus Scotland’s Dans - Purvis and Keatings. Performed like it meant everything. 

In full flight: England's Claudia Fragapane in action during the Women's Floor Final

Golden girl: England's Claudia Fragapane shows off her four Artistic Gymnastics medals

Thumbs down for...

Glasgow’s trains. A load of daily delays and cancellations but, to the enormous credit of the people of Glasgow, nobody minded much.

Funniest moment

The first 10 minutes of the opening ceremony were woeful.

My unlikely hero

Scotland’s Dan ‘For Freedom’ Wallace. Arrested in May, hero swimmer in July. Redemption.

Brit to watch in Rio

Laura Trott, as her gobsmacking cycling points race gold showed, can be the British woman with most Olympic gold. Ever.

The Games in three words...

Friendly. Inclusive. Proclaimers.

Cycling queen: Laura Trott in action for England during the women's 3000m

Hot to Trott: Cyclist Laura again claimed gold in the cycling points race

MARTHA KELNER

My favourite memory

Judo gold medallist Ashley McKenzie, former bad boy Olympian and Celebrity Big Brother star, talking about his medical struggles and plan to open a school for  children with learning difficulties.

Thumbs up for...

The return of Louis Smith, the confirmation of Max Whitlock as a world-class gymnast and the  emergence of Claudia Fragapane.

Thumbs down for...

Positive 
drugs tests, saddest of all by Nigerian weightlifter Chika Amalaha, 16, a
 young talent clearly fallen into the wrong hands.

Funniest moment 

Australian
 diver Grant Nel slipping on the edge of the 3m board and  hitting the 
water on his back, unhurt. It’s in the British DNA that we enjoy seeing 
an Aussie land on his bum.

Caught out: Nigerian weightlifter Chika Amalaha failed a drugs test during  the Commonwealth Games

High flyer: Max Whitlock proved his credentials as a world-class athlete during the Commonwealth Games

My unlikely hero

Lightweight boxing champion  Charlie Flynn, who used his moment in the spotlight to thank his mum for doing his washing.

Brit to watch in Rio

Jodie ‘Moneylegs’ Williams. After two injury-plagued years she produced a personal best in the 200m.

The Games in three words...

Won people round.

Back to his best: Louis Smith returned to form after a period away from the sport

Performances of Louis Smith, Max Whitlock and Jodie Williams all impressed

Laura Trott and Alistair and Jonny Brownlee again proved their class

Games tarnished by failed drugs tests - including 16-year-old Chika Amalaha
