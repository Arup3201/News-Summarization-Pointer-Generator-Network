Real Madrid's start to the 2014/15 La Liga season has been far from desirable, with Carlo Ancelotti's men lagging in 14th position after two losses from their first three games. 

Los Blancos have been under considerable scrutiny from their fans, and leading Spanish newspaper Marca ramped up the pressure on Saturday with their headline, 'Una Finale En Septiembre'.

'A cup final in September', signifying that Madrid's game with Deportivo La Coruna on Saturday evening is a must-win, as Ancelotti fights to save his job at the Bernabeu. 

'A final in September'... Marca ramp up the pressure on Carlo Ancelotti in Saturday's paper

Marca report that Ancelotti will make two defensive switches, replacing Pepe with Varane in the centre of defence, and Alvaro Arbeloa returning to right-back.

The paper also state that Madrid are 'without room for error', and touch on Cristiano Ronaldo's record of having never scored at Riazor, Deportivo's 'manor'.

AS focus on much the same topic, quoting Ancelotti as saying, 'I don't understand so much worry.' 

Ancelotti continues: 'The pre-season was strange because of the World Cup. There wasn't time for us to practice.'

'The season is long and we will fight to the end in all competitions.'

Mundo Deportivo's main story focuses on the other La Liga powerhouses, Barcelona, with the headline 'Total Control'.

Much more positive news in that part of Spain, it seems, as Barcelona sit pretty at the top of the league - three matches, three wins, and no goals conceded.

The paper report that Barca manager Luis Enrique monitors his players' physical performance daily thanks to a GPS system, and Lionel Messi's nephew Agustin, is already in the Barcelona academy at the age of 6...one to watch?

Over in Italy, focus is solely on the San Siro showdown between AC Milan and Juventus on Saturday night.

La Gazzetta dello Sport have a headline quote from Carlos Tevez: 'Milan, lets see what you've got', with the words 'Apache fires up the San Siro showdown' below.

Tevez goes on to claim that 'My Juve is stronger than a year ago', ahead of the match. Both Juventus and AC Milan are unbeaten this season, and have maximum points.

Tuttosport run with the headline, 'Brividi Allegri' - 'Allegri Goosebumps', as the manager prepares for his first big clash in charge at Juventus, against his previous club.

The headline is accompanied by the quote, 'I am not afraid. Inzaghi? I started out training small teams'.

It seems there is no love lost ahead of this tie...
