Beaming into the camera, this is the 13-year-old girl who died after plunging 20ft from a ski lift in the Italian Alps.

Poonam Bhattal, of Slough, Berkshire, struck her head on a concrete pylon when she slipped from a chairlift while on a school trip to the small resort of Claviere, near the border with France.

The teenager survived the fall but died on Friday morning after suffering a suspected cardiac arrest on the way to hospital.

Teenager: Poonam Bhattal was thought to have been having a ski lesson with pupils from the Guru Nanak Sikh Academy when she fell on to the piste in the resort of Claviere

Angelic: Schoolgirl Poonam Bhattal, 13, from Slough, Berks., plunged to her death from a ski lift in the Alps on a half-term school trip to Claviere, Italy

Workers at the Miramonti ski lodge, 
where the party of 30 from Guru Nanak Sikh Academy in Hayes, Middlesex, was staying,
paid tribute over the weekend to a young girl who was ‘always happy, 
always smiling’ .

‘We saw her leave the hotel just like all the other mornings, happy and smiling with her friends,’ one staff member said. 'It’s terrible. Nothing like this has ever happened before here.’

Tragedy had struck on the first lift of the day, moments after the teenager had put on her skis.

According to newly-emerged details, 
the schoolgirl slid from the chair after accidentally sitting in the 
wrong seat of the four-man chairlift.

Investigators told the La Stampa 
newspaper: ‘She didn’t end up sitting in her assigned seat, perhaps as a
joke or because she lost her balance. In any case she ended up sitting 
in the arms of a school friend.

Grieving: Pupils from Poonam's school have expressed their devastation at her tragic death on social networking sites

‘Because of this the safety bar didnt go all the way down, so at the first tremour of the lift, she slid and fell’.

The schoolgirl’s injuries were 
compounded by the fact that she fell not onto fresh snow but onto a 
stream in which there lay several rocks, it has now emerged.

The teenager was riding on the lift 
with three other children, unaccompanied by any adults, one skier who 
arrived on the scene immediately afterwards claimed.

The French skier, a teacher on a 
different school trip, said: ’There were no adults on the chair, just 
four youngsters altogether. I believe the children were messing around, jostling each other.

‘They hadn’t managed to put the barrier down properly. The lift operator heard shouting. He 
went to stop the lift - maybe three to four seconds passed. But it was too late. 
She had already fallen.

Accident: The schoolgirl came off the ski-lift in the Italian resort of Claviere, which is in the Alps

‘Unfortunately its a horrible tragic accident. No one is to blame.’

An investigation has been launched into the safety of the lift, and a postmortem will take place early in the week.

Over the weekend the girl’s family 
flew out to Italy to meet teachers and fellow pupils who were due to 
leave the resort last night.

Pupils at the academy were today remembering their school friend by bringing memories and 
pictures of Poonam into class.

Over the weekend they took to social 
media sites to remember her. One said: ‘School’s going to be so dead on
Monday. We’ve lost a sister. ’

Another wrote: ‘We’ve lost a best friend and drama queen. RIP Poonam.’
