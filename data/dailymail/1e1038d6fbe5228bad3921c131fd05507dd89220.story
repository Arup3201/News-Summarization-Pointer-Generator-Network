In the dock: Shareholders hope the legal tussle will force Goodwin to answer for his disastrous stewardship of RBS

Fred Goodwin and his former entourage at Royal Bank of Scotland have been served with a £4bn lawsuit by shareholders.

Herbert Smith – the law firm representing both the bank and former directors, including Goodwin – received court papers marking the beginning of a civil suit today.

RBS shareholders are hoping the legal tussle will put Goodwin in the dock for the first time since the financial crisis, forcing him to answer for his disastrous stewardship of RBS.

Some 100 institutions and 12,000 private shareholders have signed up to the RBoS Action Group suit, which claims investors were misled into taking part in the bank’s disastrous 2008 rights issue.

The bank encouraged investors to buy £12bn of shares, which plummeted in value when the bank flirted with collapse, before being rescued with £45.5bn of taxpayers’ money just months later.

Lawyers at Bird & Bird will argue that information given to investors billed the cash call as a ‘capital strengthening exercise’ rather than an emergency effort to raise money.

They are understood to believe their claim is different from two failed cases against RBS in the US.

Shares in RBS were down 1 per cent or 3.45p at 280.25p in late morning trading.

A spokesman for the action group said: 'Today represents a giant step forward for the many thousands of ordinary people who lost money as the result of inexcusable actions taken by banks and their directors in the financial crisis.

'Now, for the first time, some of these directors will have to answer for their actions in a British court.'

RBOS said its claim was lodged with the taxpayer-payer backed bank and in London's High Court today.

Alongside Goodwin, the group is also starting proceedings against former RBS chairman Tom McKillop, former investment bank boss Johnny Cameron and ex-finance director Guy Whittaker.

The claim is the second in recent days to be lodged against RBS after a group of 21 claimants launched a multimillion-pound lawsuit last week, also over its 2008 cash call.

The RBOS claim alleges the bank's directors 'sought to mislead shareholders by misrepresenting the underlying strength of the bank and omitting critical information from the 2008 rights issue prospectus'.

As a result, it argues the 81 per cent-state-owned bank is liable for losses sustained by investors who participated.

RBS declined to comment.
