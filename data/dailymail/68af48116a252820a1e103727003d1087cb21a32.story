A pet owner starved her two dogs so badly that one was forced to eat part of his mother’s dead body in a desperate attempt to survive.

The mother died a ‘horrendous’ death and both were in a terrible state when found after two weeks of starvation earlier this year at the home of Katrina Plumridge, 31, in Grimsby, Lincolnshire.

The barely-alive dog was ‘shockingly thin’ and the house had a ‘nauseating and overpowering’ stench, Grimsby Magistrates Court heard.

The suffering was so serious that the female Staffordshire bull terrier, named Ronnie, died of starvation, Nigel Burn, prosecuting, told the court last Friday.

The male dog, her son Scrappy, was so badly emaciated that he ate her body to try to survive.

‘The degree of suffering caused to both dogs was extreme and prolonged,’ Mr Burn said. ‘It was as severe and extreme as it can get.’

The alarm was raised when a letting agent visited her home and saw dog mess on the steps, stairs, an upstairs floor and a bed.

A painfully thin dog jumped past him. He said its ribs, spine and hip bones could all be seen and it was the thinnest dog he had ever witnessed.

He tried to go into the kitchen but it
was blocked from the inside by the dead body of the mother dog. The 
letting agent then called the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

Mr Burn said: ‘Every single bone in its frame was visible and the stomach was curved in. The empty dog bowls were bone dry.’

A
decorator who went into the house said the stench made him feel 
physically sick, Ronnie was like a skeleton and Scrappy was ‘shockingly 
thin’.

A veterinary surgeon estimated that the dogs would have been suffering from starvation for at least two weeks.

Plumridge moved out of the house on March 28 but the dogs weren’t found until April 19. She had claimed a friend was supposed to be finding new homes for the dogs and left them without going back to check on them.

But the RSPCA treated this with scepticism because she couldn’t give a full name or a telephone number for her friend.

She even claimed that she could not leave bowls of food or water for the dogs because decorating was going on.

Plumridge admitted they were ‘horrendous’ offences and led to ‘very sad circumstances’, Ed Bates, defending, said.

He
added: ‘Plumridge claimed that the dogs were looked after OK but she 
admitted that no bowls were left for them "because decorating was going 
on".

‘Concern had been raised by visitors because the dogs seemed to be hungry - but these dogs were always hungry and would eat anything that was put down.

‘One of the dogs had pinched some of the decorator’s sandwiches but they always acted that way and it was not because they were not being fed properly.’

'Concern had been raised by visitors because the dogs seemed to be hungry - but these dogs were always hungry and would eat anything that was put down'

Ed Bates, defending

Unemployed Plumridge was handed an 18-week suspended prison sentence, 180 hours’ unpaid work and was ordered to pay £500 costs.

Magistrate Tony Miller told her: ‘You should have continued to check on them to ensure there were in safe keeping.’

Plumridge was banned from owning, keeping or being involved with the care of animals until further notice under the Animal Welfare Act.

She will have to serve a minimum ban of one year before applying to a court to have the ban lifted.
