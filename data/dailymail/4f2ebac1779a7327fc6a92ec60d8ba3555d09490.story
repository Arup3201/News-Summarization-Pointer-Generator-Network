Discovery: Christine Rideout found documents which had been signed by William Franklin

When veteran bargain hunter Christine Ridout noticed some tattered pieces of parchment at a garage sale, curiosity got the better of her.

She bought the documents for a measly $3, but later discovered they date back to the Revolutionary War and that state officials from New Jersey had spent decades searching for them.

The 52-year-old from Toronto found the 250-year-old long-lost papers at the sale in Buffalo, New York, but was unaware of their significance.

She then discovered one document was written in 1710 and had the royal seal of the British court of St. James on it, while the other was signed by William Franklin, the illegitimate son of Benjamin Franklin in 1771.

Ridout thought she had 'hit the jackpot' but now has to return the documents because they have been reported missing to a number of law enforcement agencies, including the FBI.

The garage sale had been one of several the veteran bargain hunter had visited that day.

She asked how much the documents were and immediately purchased them, despite having no idea about their historical value.

'I thought I hit the jackpot; I was all excited, like I had a winning lottery ticket,' Ridout told The Philadelphia Inquirer.

'Never in my lifetime would I have expected to come across anything like this.

'Then, I looked at the State of New Jersey website and felt like I was holding a lottery ticket that had expired.

It has been suggested at least five of the six documents were reported stolen by the state of New Jersey to the FBI and other law-enforcement agencies.

Ridout added: 'That's my kind of luck.

'I thought (the discovery of the 18th-century materials) really knocked it out of the park.

'But the State of New Jersey says, 'It belongs to us".'

Officials have since requested for the materials to be returned and have asked Ridout to post the documents so they can be authenticated.

She has already emailed images of the papers and was told by officials 
'they appear to be the real McCoy'.

History: The documents found dated back to the Revolutionary War which with the Battle of Lexington in 1775 (illustrated) where the first skirmish between the United States and Britain took place

'I want to do the right thing,' she said.

'But I don't want to mail the documents. I don't trust the mail.'

Ridout
hopes to be compensated in some way for recovering the historic papers.

Nathan Raab, vice president of the Raab 
Collection, a firm that specializes in American and 
presidential historical documents, said: 'These pieces give a glimpse into the relationship between England and her colonies, in this case specifically New Jersey.

'If they are original, they are significant documents for this reason.

'However, compared with the number of people who collect Revolutionary War material, for example, the market for colonial New Jersey material is not as broad.

'Moreover, since these were acts passed annually, they would not be unique.

'Setting these documents aside, pieces signed by William Franklin are generally not particularly valuable, ranging from a few hundred to a couple thousand dollars

'This is primarily because to the general public William is famous only for being Benjamin Franklin's son.'

One of Ridout's documents, marked with the royal seal, gave the British Crown's approval of 'An Act for ascertaining the Place of the Sitting of the Representatives to meet in General Assembly.'

Other pages approved funds for 'Doctor Benjamin Franklin, Agent of this Colony at the Rate of One Hundred pounds per anum,' and for his 'Excellency William Franklin Esquire at the rate of Sixty pounds per Annum Money aforesaid for House Rent during the Continuance of this Act, provided he makes Perth Amboy or Burlington the Place of his Residence.'

Ridout said the sellers of the papers were going to
give any leftover documents to a good will store, so she believed she saved the historic papers.
