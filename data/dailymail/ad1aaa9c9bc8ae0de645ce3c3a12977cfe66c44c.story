Anthony Dunne, 19, had been having an affair with mother-of-two Anita Setz, 43, pictured, who was his counsellor at a young offenders institution

A teenage inmate hanged himself after having an affair with a 43-year-old mother volunteering as a prison counsellor, an inquest has heard.

Anthony Dunne, 19, began sleeping with the mother-of-two just weeks after he was released on licence from a young offenders institution.

But the relationship spiralled out of control when Dunne returned late to his probation hostel.

Fearing he would be jailed again, Dunne - who had a psychiatric disorder - fled and lived with Anita Setz.

But after three weeks, he ran out of his anti-psychotic medication and attacked Ms Setz who was forced to jump out of an upstairs window to escape him.

Ms Setz was rushed to hospital where she underwent surgery for more than five hours to treat her injuries while Dunne was arrested.

An inquest heard Dunne was taken to Rochester young offenders' institution, Kent, where he took his own life despite being on hourly suicide watch.

Ms Setz told the inquest in Maidstone, Kent, she met Dunne when he was serving a sentence for actual bodily harm and gave him counselling on behalf of a charity called Starting Point.

Ms Setz, who is divorced and has two sons then aged 13 and 15, said Dunne begged for her phone number at the end of their counselling sessions.

She said: 'I think at the time I was actually quite flattered by his advances. He was really humorous, he made me cry with laughter.'

Ms Setz started visiting Dunne near his probation hostel in Basildon, Essex, every fortnight. She said: 'He was attracted to me, he made it clear.'

The first time she brought Dunne to her village home near Tunbridge Wells, Kent, he was friendly and got on well with her children.

At the end of August 2004, she dropped him back 40 minutes after curfew to the hostel. He fled, paranoid he would be sent back to jail.

She said: 'I said "I will come back and get you but only if you will agree that you will get in touch with your probation officer tomorrow".'

But the next day was a bank holiday and by Tuesday he was convinced he would be imprisoned.

Ms Setz said: 'I didn't contact anyone because I thought number one, the repercussions for him, and number two, the repercussions for me.'

Hearing: The inquest at Archbishops Palace, Maidstone, comes nine years after Dunne's death and is ongoing

She said he was happy at first, but Dunne gradually became more paranoid.

She said: 'He was growing really suspicious about what I was doing, where I was and whether I was likely to call the police.'

The couple had been living together for three weeks when Dunne starting drinking heavily on a night out at the cinema to see Collateral Damage on September 20, 2004.

Ms Setz's friend was looking after her two boys and Dunne attacked Ms Setz when she tried to leave to join them.

Eventually she distracted him and jumped from her bedroom window, still in high heels, to escape.

Nick Brown, counsel for Dunne's family, told her: 'You knew, didn't you, that you had to maintain professional boundaries?'

She admitted she had been in the wrong, but said: 'It isn't uncommon for counsellors or clinicians to develop strong emotional ties and feelings for the clients and vice versa.

'That 19-year-old was dangerous, he was courageous, forthright, opinionated - he was not just a naive innocent 19-year-old lad.'

Ms Setz tried giving counselling again after the incident but soon gave it up, she told the jury.

She is now working as a self-employed horse box driver and a valeter of mobile homes, with no intention ever to return to counselling.

Colleagues had been raising concerns about her lack of boundaries with clients for about a year, the inquest heard.

After the affair she was banned from entering Rochester Young Offenders' Institution.

Meanwhile, public officials have been criticised for taking nine years to hold the inquest.

It is believed the delay was due to the complex nature of the case combined with a severe backlog among Kent's coroners.

In 2011 inspectors said it was 'unacceptable' that the inquest into Dunne's death had still not been held.

The inquest continues.
