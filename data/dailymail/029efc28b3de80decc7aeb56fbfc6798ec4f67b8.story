In the race for lieutenant governor of Texas, one candidate's supporters have taken inspiration from Buzzfeed by mocking the opposition using a series of cat GIFs.

On a website dubbed Dewfeed that is built to look uncannily like the meme-spreading site, Texans for Republican Dan Patrick posted a series of short animated cat images that highlight what they call incumbent lieutenant governor David Dewhurst’s lack of leadership at June’s abortion bill filibuster.

With posts like ‘Wendy Davis began her filibuster and Dewhurst began chasing his tail,’ Patrick gets catty in his fight to unseat Dewhurst, who has held the job since 2002.

Win? Republican Dan Patrick hopes to oust lieutenant governor David Dewhurst with the help of animated cats on political site based on BuzzFeed called DewFeed

‘The night that will live in Texas political infamy, as told by cats,’ is the title of the list of nine reasons—paired with cat GIFs—Patrick believes voters should out Dewhurst.

The unusual campaign tactic was borne from the widespread criticism Dewhurst received following the short-lived Democrat victory over Texas abortion opponents led by a now nationally-known Wendy Davis.

With the crowd in the Texas Senate gallery chanting at deafening levels, Dewhurst stood at the podium with his hands in his pockets as his fellow Republicans pleaded and shouted for order.

Fail? Texas lieutenant governor David Dewhurst attracted ire from many state republicans who believe he failed to stop June's abortion bill fillibuster

LOL? Supporters of Dewhurst opponent Dan Patrick created DewFeed to highlight what they see as the incumbent's failings--using cats

Amid one of the wildest scenes in the Texas Legislature in recent memory, Dewhurst failed to stop Davis and her supporters from running out the clock in her quest to stop the passage of a bill that all but bans abortions in the Lone Star State.

Dewhurst faced almost immediate criticism from rivals within his own party and now Patrick is taking advantage of the initial spectacle by creating another.

DewFeed pairs BuzzFeed’s rating system 
with photos of the lieutenant governor: ‘LOL,’ ‘FAIL’ and ‘NOPE’ are 
pinned to Dewhurst’s frowing mug.

OMG: The site dubs June's abortion bill filibuster and the ensuing controversy as 'The night that will live in Texas political infamy, as told by cats'

Cute? DewFeed uses BuzzFeed's highly recognizable list format and rating system of LOL, FAIL, OMG, etc

WTF? The site and its uncanny resemblance to BuzzFeed ends with a call to arms, so to speak--an animated cat fighting a dog with a Star Wars light sabre

Cats fight, sleep drunkenly, and generally act like fools in the GIFs that tell the story of the filibuster and Dewhurst’s role in it as the person in charge of controlling the flow of state legislation.

The list ends with a call to arms.

Above the final GIF, of a cat and dog fighting with Star Wars light sabres, comes the plea for votes.

‘Support Dan Patrick, candidate for Texas Lt. Governor,’ it reads. ‘He’ll never back down from a fight.’

V is for victory! Wendy Davis, Texas state senator from Ft. Worth, reacts to her successful filibuster in June. The democrat's victory may lead to Dewhurst's failure

Memes: Davis herself was the focus of internet memes following her highly publicized filibuster, notably from the pink athletic shoes she wore to stay comfortable during the marathon oration
