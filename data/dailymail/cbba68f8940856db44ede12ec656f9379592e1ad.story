Ollie Middleton, aged 18, has been selected as Labour's candidate for the 2015 general election in Bath

The Labour party has selected an 18-year-old to stand for Parliament.

Ollie Middleton, who was born just two years before Tony Blair’s New Labour landslide, is to contest the Bath seat in 2015.

But the university student will have a fight on his hands, trying to overturn a Lib Dem majority of almost 12,000.

Anyone can stand for election once they turn 18, and Mr Middleton will be 20 by the time voters in Bath go to the polls.

But Mr Middleton is young enough to be the grandson of current Bath MP Don Foster.

It is not clear if Mr Foster, who first won the seat for the Lib Dems since 1992, will stand for re-election in 2015.

Labour party insiders say they were initially surprised at Mr Middleton’s selection, but he impressed activists with an impassioned speech.

Mr Middleton, a student at Westminster University, said: ‘I am absolutely thrilled to have been given the chance to represent Labour in my home city.  I’ve enjoyed the selection process which has been robust and competitive.

‘However, the real work starts now. The Bath Labour Party is campaigning on issues that affect the people of Bath including the proposed closure of Children’s centres and it offers a real and positive alternative to the Lib Dem policies'

Labour party managers said they thought the idea of selecting an 18-year-old could have been 'mad' but insist Mr Middleton impressed the selection meeting

Mr Middleton added: 'Our campaigning work will continue to 
engage directly with local people. I will listen to the people of Bath 
and fight for the issues that matter to them.’

Bath was Tory-held for almost 70 years, until Mr Foster dramatically defeated then-Tory chairman Chris Patten in 1992.

At
the last election in 2010, Mr Foster took 57 per cent of the vote for 
the Lib Dems, with the Tories on 31 per cent and Labour trailing on just
7 per cent – half what it achieved in 2005.

At the 2010 general election, Labour polled just 7 per cent of the vote, well behind the Tories and Lib Dems

Diana Page, who oversaw Labour’s selection process, told MailOnline that Mr Middleton had impressed party activists at the weekend’s selection meeting, beating off competition from older, more experienced candidates.

‘Ollie gave a speech that was just so professional and came across as way beyond his years and he won the first ballot.

‘He was very impressive because normally we would look at it and think the party had gone made to select an 18-year-old.’

Babies of the House: Former holders of the title of youngest MP include (left to right) Charles Kennedy, Jo Swinson and Tony Benn

The youngest MP in the Commons is known as the ‘Baby of the House’.

The current holder of the title is Pamela Nash, Labour MP for Airdrie and Shotts, who was born on 24 June 1984 and was just 25 when elected.

Before her, Tory MP Chloe Smith was the youngest MP, having taken the Norwich North seat in a by-election in 2009. She went on to be a Treasury and Cabinet Office minister before quitting at the last reshuffle.

Other former Babies of the House to rise
to prominence include Lib Dem Business Minister Jo Swinson (25 when 
elected), former Lib Dem minister Sarah Teather (29), ex-Lib Dem leader 
Charles Kennedy (23), former Labour minister David Lammy (27) and former
Tory Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell (27).

Ex-Liberal party leader David Steel was youngest MP when elected in 196.

Ex-Labour Cabinet minister Tony Benn was first elected in 1950 aged 25 while disgraced Tory Cabinet minister John Profumo was only 25 when elected in 1944.

The youngest MP on record was James Dickson, elected as Liberal MP for Dungannon in April 1859, aged 21 years and 67 days.

In 2006 the law was changed so that the minimum age for an election candidate was lowered from 21 to 18.

However, the average age of the Commons is still 50, a year younger than in 2005 but older than the general elections of 1979, 1983 and 1987.

Labour MPs are, on average, four years older than Conservatives, and two years older than Liberal Democrats.
