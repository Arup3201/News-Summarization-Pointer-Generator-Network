Harry Hankinson, 62, a shoplifter dubbed Britain's most prolific thief is back in jail after committing his 521st crime

Britain’s 'most prolific shoplifter' has been sentenced to 16 months in jail and given an Asbo banning him from his local high street today after committing his 521st crime.

Between February and March this year, Harry Hankinson stole almost £600 worth of meat and alcohol from two supermarkets, and a handbag, two purses, a designer watch, clothing and perfume worth 
almost £3,000 from Selfridges, Marks and Spencer and House of Fraser in Manchester

The thefts meant he breached a four-month suspended prison sentence he was given last June for stealing £900 worth of goods.

As Hankinson, 65, was led away, Judge Peter Davies said he had 'never experienced in all my life sitting at the bar and bench' a defendant who had kept 'coming back for more' on so many occasions.

Hankinson began his life of stealing in 1970 after falling out of a window and claiming a bump on the head made him a kleptomaniac, changing his personality and making him addicted to theft.

During the next 44 years of offending he preyed on numerous high street shops - even taking his unsuspecting wife on a shoplifting expedition during a sightseeing coach trip.

The latest spree means he now has a total of 235 convictions for 521 offences, 432 of them for theft.

If caught in any retail outlet outside Bolton he must leave if asked to do so. The order will run for two years after his release. He must also pay a £120 victim surcharge.

Hankinson was jailed for 16 months and given an Asbo banning him from his local high street after admitting stealing handbags, clothes and a designer watch worth a total of £3,000 from stores including Selfridges

After being told of Hankinson’s catalogue of convictions Judge Peter Davies said: 'He is an indiscriminate thief and he shouldn’t be let near the shops.

'It has affected the community of traders and everybody agrees he shouldn’t go around thieving. He is a risk to retailers - I have never seen anything like it.

'This is a truly exceptional case, he has had every spindle opportunity not to commit these offences. Now he is stealing high value items.'

He told Hankinson 'It’s theft, it’s dishonesty and you are indiscriminate, targeting retail premises whether well known, international stores or ordinary traders.

Hankinson claims suffers from kleptomania which compels him to steal, but psychiatric evaluations have found no evidence to back this up

'Some of the victims of your thefts are institutions that can cover the loss but that doesn’t take away the fact that you are a pest, you keep coming back for more.

'Everything that has been done for you has failed, you keep coming back for more. I think there is no other way of protecting these traders,

'One look at your antecedents means that it is totally hopeless. You say this is impulsive that you can’t help yourself.

'You must go to custody and you have to stay in custody for a long time. This is exceptional. This is your occupation, you target shops, a watch for £1,900, purses, they are high value items.

'I take into account your guilty pleas but I also take into account there is no psychiatric diagnosis that diminishes your responsibility.'

In 1996 Hankinson's offending became so prolific his long-suffering wife Linda, then 46, spoke out to condemn an 18 week stretch he received for stealing cigarettes, spirits and groceries as being too short.

She said: 'He should have got at least 18 months. The only way he will stop is by being in prison. If he’s in there long enough he might stop and think and get some proper help while he’s locked up.

'When he’s out after short stretches its just too easy for him to go and do it again. I can’t tell you much about him because I don’t really know him, he’s been in and out of [prison] so much. The person who’s suffering out of all this is me.'

In 2008 Mrs Hankinson was unwittingly caught up in another thieving expedition when she and her husband went to Ripon, North Yorks, for a day out by a coach - to celebrate his release from another prison stretch.

On a previous occasion Hankinson asked Body Shop staff to point out some perfume for him, then walked off with the £42 gift set they recommended

Today the court heard how in February this year Hankinson stole meat from Sainsbury’s worth £110, alcohol from Aldi worth £91, clothes worth £172.96 from Marks and Spencer and a designer watch worth £1,900 from Selfridges in Manchester.

He also stole a handbag and two purses from the store totalling £570.

Hankinson, of Halliwell, Bolton, admitted seven charges
 of theft when he appeared before Bolton magistrates in April, as well as admitting stealing alcohol from Tesco worth £389 on 5th March this year.

He was bailed, but went out and stole £335 worth of perfume from House of Fraser in Manchester the following day.

Prosecuting David Toal said: 'In summary on the front page alone of his antecedent record there are offences involving theft and dishonesty between 1995 and 2014, they are almost exclusively for shop lifting.'

In Hankinson's defence, Bob Elias said he should be made subject of a day-time curfew between the hours of 9pm and 6pm during shop opening times.

Mr Elias added: 'He seemed to think that would stop him going to shops. He has a compulsion, he doesn’t drink alcohol

'He tells me he has no reason to leave the house as food is brought to him.. He returned to Selfridges - it suggests a compulsion in the theft not the profit.'
