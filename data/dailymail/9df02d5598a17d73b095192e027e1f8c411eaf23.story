Michael Piggin is said to have plotted a Columbine-style massacre at his school

A teenage neo-Nazi accused of plotting a Columbine-style massacre at his school downloaded the Mujahideen Poisons Handbook to his mobile phone, the Old Bailey heard.

Michael Piggin, 18, stored weapons and terrorist manuals in his room as he drew up a ‘hit list’ of pupils and teachers he wanted to attack, jurors heard.

He took knives into school and showed them to fellow pupils, the court heard.

Piggin allegedly planned to target two schools in his area, a mosque, cinema, university and council offices and dubbed his plans for an armed assault on his former school as ‘the new Columbine’.

Jurors were told today that Piggin downloaded extremist literature onto his mobile phone before he could carry out his attack - including the Mujahideen Poisons Handbook.

The book, written in English and 23 pages long, discusses the chemical formulas of various poisons and how they can be used in everyday objects such as face cream and fizzy drinks.

It also tests out different poisons and their effectiveness by detailing their effects on rabbits, with one passage stating: ‘Potassium cyanide results in rabbit’s death in several minutes in all of the three different tests’.

Prosecutor Gareth Patterson said the contents of the book include a whole chapter on cyanide poisoning and another on how to extract alkali poison from potatoes.

Another details how to make poison tipped arrows, the court was told.

The Old Bailey heard he 'planned to target two schools, a mosque, cinema, university and council offices'

One section states that less than a teaspoon of sodium nitrate is ‘enough to kill a person in two to four hours, can be used in a juice and tastes like lemon’.

Wearing a black Arctic Monkeys t-shirt, jeans, gold chain, and glasses, Piggin remained emotionless in the dock.

A supporter of the English Defence League, Piggin allegedly kept a notebook of potential targets and plans for his attack in a notebook covered in swastika flags.

The teenager also had a swastika flag above his bed and wrote essays on his hatred of Muslims.

He and two other 18-year-old boys, who cannot be named, have already admitted possessing petrol bombs and pipe bombs.

Piggin, of Loughborough, denies possessing articles for a purpose connected with terrorism and possession of a document or a record containing information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism on or before 19 February 2013.

The trial continues.
