The daughter of a woman charged with having underage sex with a teenager is showing her support for her mother.

The teenager daughter of Iris Gibney, the 42-year-old Pottstown, Pennsylvania mother of four who was allegedly found naked and having sex with a 17-year-old in November announced on her Instagram account, 'me and my mom are best friends.'

This as Gibney waived her court hearing today and is now set to head to trial in February on charges including corruption of a minor, dissemination of explicit materials to a minor and trespass by auto.

She is currently free on $50,000 bail and as of last week was back at her job, working as a sales associate at Victoria's Secret.

'I can tell you that Ms. Gibney is devastated by her conduct in this case,' defense attorney Fortunato Perri told CBS Philly. 

'It’s been extremely difficult for her family. She’s been a loving and devoted mother and wife.'

Iris met the boy at a football game while volunteering as a cheer mom at her older daughter's school the unnamed teen told the arresting officer when the two were picked up at around 10:30pm on November 15 in a parked truck in Hollenbach Park.

Police were suspicious as the truck was parked illegally and the park was closed.

The teen immediately said he could not lie and revealed the details of their relationship.

After the arrest it was discovered that Iris and the teen had been communicating through a chatroom and Twitter, and that she had been sending partially nude photos to the boy from her phone.

Ryan also said he was 'upset' and 'hurt' when he found out what happened

Oddlly enough, Iris told the officer who caught her and the teen, 'I’ve never been in trouble before. I can’t believe I did this. I have three children of my own — I am so, so sorry.'

This despite having four children.

County prosecutor Kristen Feden says the victim in this case is prepared to testify at the hearing: 'at the very least testify as to the pictures that were exchanged, and obviously he would also testify as to the sexual contact that occurred between him and Iris Gibney.

Iris' husband meanwhile has said he's 'upset, hurt and just trying to keep his family together.'
