Last September, a tennis coach got on a plane for Los Angeles and started a two-day conversation that might just give the men’s game the shake-up it’s been waiting for, and might just cause Andy Murray a sleepless night.

That coach was Roger Rasheed, a former Aussie Rules footballer and known gut-buster, and the prodigy he spoke to was Grigor Dimitrov, the then 22-year-old from a tough street in Bulgaria who had grown tired of his own hype.

‘He phoned me one day,’ Rasheed told Sportsmail. ‘I had watched him since he was 16. I had seen what he has to bring, his abilities. We agreed to meet.’

Return: Dimitrov has changed his opinion since 2011 and now wants to get rid of the Baby Fed label

Big hit: Dimitrov proved too flamboyant for his own good at times and had his controversies

Mats Wilander, the seven-time Grand Slam winner, tells Sportsmail what he makes of Grigor Dimitrov.

'I see Dimitrov as a Slam winner,' he says.

'The improvements he has made in the past year are obvious, though it wasn't obvious he would take the step up.

'I'd say he is at the front of the new players coming through.

'He is like a raw Roger Federer - not as polished but he has an excellent all-round game on all courts.

'He is a threat to Andy Murray and the rest already.'

Dimitrov was the teenage star with the elegant style who in a three-month period in 2008 won the junior events at the US Open and Wimbledon.

His former coach Peter Lundgren, who had once mentored Roger Federer, had said that at 18 he was further up the curve than the Swiss who won the lot.

That’s where the Baby Fed tag came from; Dimitrov was flattered and quite liked it. ‘It’s great to hear,’ he said in June 2011.

‘I can hear this all day, put a ringtone on my phone, but you can’t compare the greatest player of all time to a dude that is 64 in the world.’

By the time Rasheed got on a plane in Australia, Dimitrov had won zero senior titles and the Baby Fed label annoyed him.

He had reached the top 30 — and unwittingly played a part in a feud between Maria Sharapova and  Serena Williams, having dated both — but a player with that all-round game was deemed to be underachieving.

He had all the shots but was often too flamboyant for his own good and he had been fined €2,000 in 2010 for shoving an umpire at a Challenger event.

There were also suggestions that his fitness was not what it could be, a point underlined by Ivan Lendl last year: ‘That guy comes out so hot but we know he can’t sustain it. If he could he would be No 1 in the world.’

Perhaps those words were in his mind when he picked up the phone to Rasheed.

‘He saw he needed to make some legitimate changes,’ said Rasheed, who had worked with Lleyton Hewitt, Gael Monfils and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.

‘I have strong philosophies on what sort of people I want to work with — people with a genuine fuel for life. I flew to LA from Australia. We spoke a lot over two days before I flew back.

'I always ask “What do you want out of this?” Straight out he says he wants to be the No 1 player in the world. Right answer.’

Dimitrov has since won his first four senior titles. On Friday he twice fought back from a set down to beat Alexandr Dolgopolov in a five-set match.

Change: The best way for Dimitrov to respond to criticism of his fitness and attitude was on the court

His interviews have been dominated by his mentions of Rasheed and his new-found ability to endure fights that reach the later rounds; his irritation has been obvious when questions then turn to  Sharapova and that Baby Fed nickname.

‘I think it’s time for everyone to kind of come up with something better,’ he said on Friday. ‘I’m proving myself not only as a player but as a person outside of the court.’

That person, it is said by those around him, is desperately competitive, a man whose lifelong refusal to drink alcohol has bemused a woman even as driven as Sharapova.

Much of it boils down to his upbringing as the only child of an ambitious tennis coach father, Dimitar, and a mother, Maria, who played high-level volleyball.

By five years old he was playing matches. He describes home, a remote area in Haskovo, as being in a ‘tough neighbourhood — there was a lot of poverty’.

Rasheed said: ‘His family are genuine, hard-working people, respectful people who respect  everyone. He is a copy of them. They respect the king and they would respect the person who picks up the garbage on Sunday.

‘The work ethic is very important. You have to understand how hard he had to work to come through like he did.

‘Bulgaria is not somewhere where you have a pool of players to compete against and push you on. He found a way to do it without that.

‘He has that drive. I’ve seen what he’s about when he trains. We have pushed him to some pretty  unstable points — that’s a hard place but a great place. But he has a look in his eyes. He loves it. It’s what he wants.’

Change: Rasheed says Dimitrov is hard working and respectful, much like the family life he comes from

The upshot is a place in the fourth round against Leonardo Mayer, the world No 59, then he faces a quarter-final against Murray if all goes to script.

He beat the  Wimbledon champion earlier this year and it is a potential tie that fascinates observers of the game.

No sport cries out for a new wave of champions quite like tennis; no player from that group of possible contenders carries quite the same weight of expectation as Dimitrov.

The question is whether his time has come.

Is it? Dimitrov needs to make his chances count and the question is whether his time has come
