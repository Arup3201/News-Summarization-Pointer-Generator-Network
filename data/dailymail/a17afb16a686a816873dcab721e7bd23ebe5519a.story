Celebrating all things Australia Day, hundreds of amateur photographers captured a world through their lens of our home-grown creatures and its' surroundings â€“ enough to make anyone grab their cameras and go out to explore.

WIRES spokeswoman Carla Toyne told Daily Mail Australia their native wildlife rescue service team were stunned by the significant amount of applicants who entered.

'This is the second year we have run the competition and we are once again bowled over by the reaction and the high quality images we have received,' Toyne told Daily Mail Australia.

'It shows how much people care and appreciate our native Australian animals and there are so many talented and compassionate individuals out there.

'It gives people a chance to share their wildlife experiences and encourage others to appreciate wildlife in their own back yard.

'WIRES exists to rescue, care for and release native fauna back into the wild and we are very proud to be able to share these images.'

The competition  closes at 10 pm on Monday January 26 2015.
