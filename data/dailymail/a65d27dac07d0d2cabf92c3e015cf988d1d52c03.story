An atmospheric shot of a greylag goose under a stormy London sky has won this year's British Wildlife Photography Awards.

The picture, entitled 'The Tourist', by Lee Acaster from Wortham, Suffolk, captures the goose in close-up by the River Thames with part of the London skyline, including the Shard skyscraper, in the background.

The shot beat thousands of entries in the annual photographic awards to win the urban wildlife category of the competition and scoop the top prize of £5,000 for the overall winning image.

This shot of a Greylag Goose taken by photographer Lee Acaster in London won this year's prize, with the competition's judge praising it's 'extraordinary' impact

This shocking image of an otter capturing a hapless puffin - taken by Richard Shucksmith in the Shetland Isles - won the animal behaviour category

Mr Acaster said of his picture: 'It was a real privilege to have such a close encounter with a wild bird in the very heart of London.

'I vividly remember the excitement I felt as she patiently waited for me to get the shot, and I knew immediately this was a once in a lifetime opportunity, I'm just grateful that she didn't lose interest as quickly as my children do when I'm taking photographs of them.'

Competition judge Mark Ward, editor-in-chief at the RSPB's Nature's Home magazine, said: 'The winning photograph shows a familiar bird in a familiar setting, but the visual impact is extraordinary.

'The stormy, brooding backdrop sets a dramatic scene, while the orange and pink from the bird bring vibrancy to the monochromatic cityscape.

'Lee's stunning photograph proves you do not have to travel far from home to capture the very best of Britain's wildlife images.'

Striking images of a shag resting, a puffin in the jaws of an otter, a gannet breeding colony, a close-up of a seal's claw and a telephone box being reclaimed by nature are among the winning photographs.

'Anyone passionate about protecting and preserving wildlife will be inspired by the British Wildlife Photography Awards, which in its fifth year has done more than any other award to raise the profile of British wildlife.'
