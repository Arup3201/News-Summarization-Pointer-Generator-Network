The United State's Central Intelligence Agency has recently come under fire for harrowing torture practices following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. But one of the prisoners accused of accused of planning and carrying out the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks says he 'does not hold any grudges' against his torturers.

On Friday, lawyers of Ammar al Baluchi issued a statement in response to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's controversial 500-page report on the CIA's interrogation techniques in which they were referred to as 'deeply flawed,' ABC reports.

James Connell, al Baluchi's lead attorney, said the prisoner 'holds no grudge against the CIA for his torture, and saw the suffering of those who torture,' according to Courthouse News Service. 

No Grudge: On Friday, lawyers of Ammar al Baluchi (photographed) issued a statement in response to the recently released CIA 'torture' report saying the prisoner 'holds no grudge against the CIA for his torture'

Deeply Flawed: Earlier this month, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released a controversial 500-page report on the CIA's interrogation techniques in which they were referred to as 'deeply flawed,'

However, Connell isn't buying his client's statements. Connell said, in the statement, that the CIA is using al Baluchi to 'retroactively justify' its torture program, according to ABC.

'The CIA and its defenders are using Mr. al Baluchi as a scapegoat for its illegal and reprehensible use of torture,' Connell said.

'The United States spent incredible amounts of money, energy, and American credibility, and now the CIA is pointing at Mr. al Baluchi to justify its massive torture infrastructure.'

Prisoners: The CIA torture report has revealed that Al Qaeda suspects were kept awake in 'stress positions' for 180 hours, waterboarded until they started vomiting and became unconscious, and one died of hypothermia chained naked to a floor

Al Baluchi is the nephew of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-proclaimed 9/11 mastermind. Al Baluchi is being held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, charged with war crimes, and is to be tried for his alleged role in planning and carrying out the 9/11 attacks. 

Al Baluchi was arrested in 2003 and the CIA admitted to subjecting the prisoner to beatings and freezing baths. 

However, Courthouse reports that Connell found it strange that the 'torture report' gave so little information about al Baluchi's experience but gave so much about that of others in custody.

The report states that at least five detainees were subjected to 'rectal feeding' or 'rectal hydration' in torture techniques 'far more brutal' than previously revealed, according to ABC. 

CIA: A United Nations special investigator demanded those responsible for 'systematic crimes' be brought to justice

Waterboard: The report details instances of detainees being waterboarded and subjected to 'rectal feeding' or 'rectal hydration' (photographed is a demonstration by the group 'World Can Wait' in New York in 2008 where thy held a mock waterboarding torture of a prisoner)

The report allegedly details what interrogators did to many detainees, but provides very little information on the treatment of al Baluchi.  

CIA officials have said that al Baluchi has provided them with valuable information and defenders of the 'torture program' said that al Baluchi's confessions gave information which led to the disruption of terror attack planned in Pakistan. 

Defenders also say that al Baluchi's torture led the prisoner to giving them information that led to the capture of Osama bin Laden.

However, the report allegedly concluded that the information had already been obtained, prior to al Baluchi's torture, and had nothing to do with the prisoner's confessions.

The report doesn't urge prosecution for wrongdoing or criminal probes, but a United Nations special investigator demanded that those responsible 'systematic crimes' be brought to justice.
