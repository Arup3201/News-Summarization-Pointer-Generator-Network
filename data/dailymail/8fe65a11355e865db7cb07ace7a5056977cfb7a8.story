Tragedy: Soldier Michael Maguire was killed by a stray bullet while taking part in a live-firing exercise at Castlemartin Ranges in Wales

Ranger Maguire was serving with the 1st Batallion of The Royal Irish Regiment.

His Company Commander, Major Richard Bell, said: 'He was one of our very best, his loss has devastated everyone who knew him.

'Michael was always going to stand out from the crowd - not only because he stood a towering 6ft 7in tall, but because of his vastly cheerful outlook on life, natural charisma and irrepressible good humour.

'All of this ensured that he was extremely popular throughout the company and his loss is keenly felt.'

Ranger Maguire was known to his army friends as High Tower because of his great height.

He went to school at St Goban's College, near Bantry, in County Cork, Ireland.

School friends and other pals took to Facebook to express their shock at the Ranger's sudden death.

Ciara Swanton said: 'R.I.P Michael Maguire. Too young!! there was always a smile on your face!!'

Ranger Maguire joined the regiment on 10 May, 2010, and was sent to Afghanistan four months later.

His Commanding Officer, Lieutenant 
Colonel Colin Weir said: 'It is with regret that we can confirm that on 
May 2, 2012, Ranger Michael Maguire died at the Castlemartin Ranges.

'Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time.

'The matter is subject to a civil police investigation and it would therefore be inappropriate to comment further whilst this is ongoing.

'The entire Battalion is deeply shocked by this tragic event.

'All our thoughts and prayers are with Ranger Maguire’s family at this difficult time.

'He was a deeply professional and likeable young man and will be sorely missed.'

Dyfed Powys Police confirmed they were investigating the shooting and the coroner has been informed.

The Castlemartin Army Training Area was established in 1939 and covers 5,900 acres in South Pembrokeshire.

A soldier was shot and badly injured during a live-firing exercise at the range in February.
