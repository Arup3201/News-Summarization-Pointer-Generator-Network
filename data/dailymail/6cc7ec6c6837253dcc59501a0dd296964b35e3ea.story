A mother subjected her toddler son to a sickening catalogue of beatings, which left him looking like he had been ‘hit with a frying pan’.

The son, just 22 months old at the time, suffered four broken bones in his arm and shoulder and numerous bruises to his head and body in a week.

His horrific injuries were revealed at Preston Crown Court in Lancashire as the 22-year-old ‘depressed’ woman was jailed for four years.

The woman has never admitted hurting the boy and was criticised by a judge for trying to pin the blame for the injuries on others.

Her father was even interviewed by police, because he helped look after the child. She was convicted of three counts of wounding and of neglect.

All of the assaults all took place in one week two years ago in Preston.

As well as being jailed, the woman was banned from ever looking after children again - including if she has any more children of her own.

Judge Heather Lloyd said: ‘The one person a child should look to for protection is his mother but this was a case which involved a parent inflicting harm upon a child. 

‘You did things to him which resulted in him having multiple fractures to his body and arms, bruising his cheeks and a significant head injury.

‘One witness said he looked like he had been hit with a frying pan. Why you did it remains a complete mystery.

‘You have never told the truth about what happened, you repeatedly changed your account and sought to blame others.

‘Your lies meant your father was 
interviewed as he had been caring for him at your request, you sought to
blame your friend partner or at least inferred that.

‘The
jury were completely satisfied that the person who repeatedly injured 
him was you.

‘You even told your friends that he had bruising to his cheeks and went through the farce of getting them to research it.

‘One response was that it may be a rare blood disease or even meningitis. You faked surprise when a lady at nursery saw him.

‘You quite deliberately did everything you could do to deflect suspicion from you. Your conduct was not an isolated event.

'But it is impossible to say when all this happened. Not all the injuries are of the same age - bruising to the cheek on Monday, the remaining injuries between Tuesday and Thursday evening, he had four fractures.

‘Fortunately he has recovered from his injuries, how he will feel when he finds out what his mother has done to him is anyone’s guess.

'One witness said he looked like he had been hit with a frying pan. Why you did it remains a complete mystery'

Judge Heather Lloyd

‘It is quite clear to me this was course of conduct over a period of time rather than an isolated incident although how you caused these injuries is impossible to say.’

The court heard that after she was arrested the child’s father attacked her and is he now serving a ‘lengthy’ prison sentence for assault.

Beverley Hackett, defending, said: ‘She understands that nothing I can say can go beyond the verdict of the jury. She has lost her son.

‘She also dreads the day when he is older and comes to know what happened and that she has some very serious questions to answer.

‘Thankfully he has been placed with her mother, which is of some comfort to her.’

Lancashire Constabulary Detective Sergeant Jamie Lillystone said: ‘We have never been able to identify how the injuries were caused to the young boy as she denied the allegations throughout the trial.

‘This was a complex and difficult case to investigate. The injuries sustained by the child were extensive but fortunately he has since made a full recovery.

‘The sentence reflects the seriousness of the crime committed and reinforces that behaviour of this cruel nature will not be tolerated.’
