The body of an Irish teenager who died after disappearing during a college trip to London was found on a rooftop of a building on Leicester Square, it emerged this afternoon.

Patrick Halpin, who was 18, is believed to have fallen from the higher roof of the Burger King restaurant onto a lower one, thought to be that of the Zoo Bar where he had been with friends from college.

A Metropolitan Police Service spokesman said: 'We believe he gained access to the Burger King roof and fell down to a lower roof'.

Patrick's body was found at 7.50pm last night.  He was last seen shortly after midnight on Wednesday when he left Zoo Bar in Bear Street, just off Leicester Square, to get food from Burger King.

He is believed to have climbed up the external fire escape to get onto the roof before falling onto another enclosed roof area.

Patrick's body was found after police traced his mobile phone signal, and discovered CCTV showing him climbing up the stairs.

Scotland Yard are still trying to establish whether there were any suspicious circumstances to the death.

One local worker said the stairs were behind a door that was usually kept locked.

The student had been visiting the capital on a trip with his college when he disappeared in freezing temperatures wearing just a pair of jeans and a blue T-shirt.

His sister, Regina Halpin, had earlier issued an appeal on Facebook to help find her brother.

She wrote: '(Patrick) was in London on a trip this week and went missing from a nightclub last night and hasn’t been seen since.'

'He was in The Zoo nightclub just of Leicester Square and left to go to Burger King but did not return home. He should have been staying in the Astor Museum Hostel, Bloomsbury, London,' she added.

She said Patrick's friends became worried about him when he failed to pick up tickets to the musical The Book Of Mormon which he had been particularly looking forward to seeing.

Hours later his frantic family mounted a search of the area.
