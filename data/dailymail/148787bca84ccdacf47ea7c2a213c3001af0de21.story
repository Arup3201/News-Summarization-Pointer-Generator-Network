Brian Williams acted like it was just another day as he appeared on television from the anchor's chair of the NBC Nightly News - without mentioning the mounting firestorm over his professional blunders.

Williams, NBC's leading name in news, introduced segments on conflict in the Middle East, as well as extreme weather, even as his earlier reporting on the same topics was pored over by his own network - and rivals.

The longstanding anchor made a humiliating apology after admitting a story he told about being on a helicopter hit by an RPG in Iraq was untrue.

Prophetic? Williams gave no sign of things being out of the ordinary as he faced his own moment of crisis over his misreporting of his time in Iraq - and alleged discrepancies from the wake of Hurricane Katrina, too

He has also been accused of fabricating elements of his time in New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, during which he said he saw a body floating down the street, and caught dysentery from flood water.

Williams is also at risk from rivals who want his job, according to the New York Daily News.

Former NBC presenter, and current Yahoo! News personality Katie Couric, has allegedly been dropping hints that she would like to take his place - if the dent dent in his credibility proves insurmountable.

Williams confessed that he 'made a mistake recalling' a flight he took on a Chinook helicopter over Iraq in 2003.

'Made a mistake recalling': Williams, shown left in Iraq and right in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, has found his claims met with scrutiny

He has previously said the aircraft he was on was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade that miraculously didn't explode, and managed to land with no loss of life.

In the most extreme version of the tale, told to David Letterman in March 2013, he said: 'Two of our four helicopters were hit by ground fire, including the one I was in, RPG and AK-47.'  

In fact, he was on a different aircraft entirely, which by some accounts was as much as an hour behind the one helicopter which was actually hit.

He recanted his account after being called out by veterans who really were on the chopper.

NBC has launched an official probe into Williams, lead by Richard Esposito, its top investigative journalist.

Since the apology, questions were also raised about statements Williams made on coverage of Hurricane Katrina, which was one of his proudest moments at NBC.

He claimed to see a body floating down the street in the French Quarter of New Orleans, past the Ritz-Carlton hotel where he was staying.

Sore spot: Williams's Friday broadcast opened with an exclusive story from Iraq - the country from which Williams's much-maligned error stemmed

In a 2006 interview he referenced the moment: 'When you look out of your hotel room window in the French Quarter and watch a man float by face down, when you see bodies that you last saw in Banda Aceh, Indonesia, and swore to yourself that you would never see in your country'.

Some are sceptical of the story, as the French Quarter was not extensively flooded in the disaster, bringing into question whether there would have been enough water for a body to float down the street.

He has also claimed that flood water gave him dysentery, which medics have said was not prevalent during Katrina.

Nonetheless, Williams's top two items tonight were on the very subjects under most scrutiny. He led the broadcast with a story from the struggle with ISIS in Iraq, then moved on to the impact of extreme weather in America, included flooding in California. 

As well as the internal probe, the Daily News also reported that 'a secret task-force' from the rival ABC network is also dredging up old footage of Williams in the hope of finding more claims which do not withstand scrutiny.

According to the newspaper, Ben Sherwood, the president of Disney-ABC Television Group, ordered the task-force himself - but the network has strongly denied such a group exists.

The News also outlined another threat allegedly closing in on Williams - his former NBC colleague Katie Couric, now a big-name anchor at Yahoo! Global News.

A source told the paper: 'Katie still has deep, deep contacts at NBC. She would love to return as the Nightly News anchor... She wants to be back in the big leagues again.'

Others denied she had designs on the NBC top spot.
