She has recently gained a role as Paul McCartney’s wife, but Nancy Shevell announced today that she’s stepping down from another.

Ms Shevell said in a news conference Wednesday that she’s resigning from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board, which oversees the vast public transit network in New York City.

She served on the board for 11 years and was appointed in 2001 by then-New York governor George Pataki.

Not going your way: Nancy Shevell, seen at an MTA meeting in 2009, will step down from the transit board

Hello, goodbye: Nancy Shevell wed Sir Paul McCartney, right, last October after dating four years

Easily the biggest star-power to the MTA board, Ms Shevell stayed on as a holdover after her most recent term expired in 2010.

‘I’m very emotional and sad right now,’ she told board members. ‘In my 30-year professional career, this has been the highlight.’

Though she didn’t give a formal reason for her resignation, she told reporters: ‘It was time.’

She said she now plans to divide her time between New York City and London. Sir McCarthy owns a townhouse in London and a massive estate in East Sussex.

Let it be: Nancy Shevell served on the MTA's board for more than a decade

She married the former Beatle in October in a quiet ceremony. The 51-year-old trucking heiress kept out of the limelight during the couple’s four-year courtship. 

Friends say there was ‘some good-natured negotiation’ before Ms Shevell finally relented to her fiance’s wishes and agreed to make their marital base in Britain, instead of at her home in New York’s exclusive Upper East Side.

Ms Shevell, who is 18 years younger than her husband, is the heiress to a vast $400million fortune from her trucking magnate father Myron 'Mike' Shevell’s New Jersey company.

Helter skelter: The MTA may soon face another possible transit strike

When she isn’t dating music legends or running subway systems, Ms Shevell devotes her time to philanthropies. 

In 2010, she was criticised for skipping several MTA public hearings in favour of a ball at Lincoln Centre, the New York Daily News observed.

She leaves the MTA just as rumours of another transit strike loom.

The last strike, which happened in 2005, saw some 34,000 union workers walk off the job, leaving millions of commuters stranded.
