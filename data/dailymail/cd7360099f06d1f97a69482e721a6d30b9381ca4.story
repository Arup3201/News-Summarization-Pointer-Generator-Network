'Depressed': Angel Vega Roman (pictured) allegedly bit the lips off a kitten, burnt its ear and strangled another to death

A Florida man has been charged with animal cruelty after allegedly biting the lips off a kitten and strangling another to death.

Angel Vega Roman, 28, reportedly confessed that he had maimed the cats, which belonged to his roommates, because he was depressed at losing his girlfriend.

According to a Flagler County Sheriff's report, he told an acquaintance he accidentally choked one kitten, chewed the lips off another and 'burnt its ear and whiskers with a lighter'. Two cats are unaccounted for.

He was arrested on Saturday after the acquaintance called the authorities.

When officers went to Roman's Palm Coast home, he said he been had been 'depressed lately because his girlfriend is gone and that is why he harmed the animals', the report states.

Roman was taken into protective custody under the Florida Mental Health Act.

The kittens' owners told deputies that Roman spent a lot of time with the cats, but did not realise he was harming them.

He had been left alone with the felines while the owners were out of town.

When they returned, one kitten was found dead, but the owners believed it was due to natural causes.

A veterinarian said the injuries to Oreo were consistent with statements made to deputies. The cat has been released to the custody of the city of Palm Coast.

Roman, who has been arrested eight times since 2009, also is charged with probation violation, according to Jacksonville.com.

He remains on $100,000 bail at the Flagler County Inmate Facility.
