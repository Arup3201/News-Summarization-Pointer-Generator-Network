Former Barcelona and France defender Eric Abidal has announced he will be retiring from football, with his last match against Kalloni AEL this weekend.

The Frenchman joined Greek champions Olympiacos in the summer after spending a second spell at Monaco back in his native France.

Abidal revealed he has had offers of non-playing roles with Olympiacos and Barca, the club he was playing for when he suffered a liver tumour in 2011 which affected the latter part of his career.

Eric Abidal will play his final match of his professional career this weekend for Olympiacos

Abidal has played just seven games for his new side, but insists the time is right to retire

The most successful time for Abidal's was with Barcelona, with two Champions League titles the pinnacle

"I depart for personal reasons, as I have said. Only a professional player knows when and how he has to retire," Abidal said.

"I have had a lot of very happy moments in my career.

"Two months ago I talked with the president and told him, 'In December I will leave because the time has come'.

"I will relax with my family and my friends. I have two offers, from Olympiacos and Barcelona, and I will think about these and take my decision."

2000: Abidal Joins Monaco from amateur side Lyon Duchere in his home city.

2002: Follows boss Claude Puel to Lille, where he stays for two seasons.

2004: Returns home to Lyon and wins three consecutive league titles.

2007: Joins Barcelona for six trophy-ladened years, playing through liver problems.

2013: Returns to Monaco after 11 years.

2014: Joins Olympiacos but plays just seven games before announcing retirement. 

Abidal began his top-level career in 2000 when he signed for Monaco from French lower-league side OL Duchere.

He then joined Lille before moving in 2004 to his hometown club Lyon, helping them win three Ligue 1 titles in succession, as well as reaching the 2007 Coupe de la Ligue final.

Further success followed with Barca, with four Spanish titles and Champions League glory in 2009 and 2011, beating Manchester United in the final on each occasion.

While those honours - along with helping France to the 2006 World Cup final - feature highly among Abidal's career highlights, he is grateful simply to have had the chance to play professionally both before and after his illness.

"One of the best memories is when you lift a trophy but the best moment is passing from the amateur level to become a professional footballer," Abidal added.

 "Your dreams are coming true and then you have to work every day to remain a professional player."

Abidal played a key role in what was one of Barcelona's most successful eras in their history

He returned for Barca after his health problems and was given the captain's armband by regular skipper Carles Puyol after the 2011 European final to allow him to lift the trophy.

"It was a very great moment in my career," Abidal said of his return to action.

"In football you have positive moments and negative moments and when a negative moment occurs, you have to be determined. 

March 2011: Barcelona announce news that Abidal has tumour on his liver.

May 2011: Plays full 90 mins in CL final win over Man United, and lifts trophy as captain.

April 2012: Undergoes liver transplant surgery after problems with previous treatment.

January 2013: Returns to training after a spell at home to fully recover.

April 2013: Plays first full 90 minutes since surgery in 1-0 home success over Levante.  

"I used football to forget my illness and at an emotional level, this moment was even greater than lifting a trophy."

Abidal won 67 caps for his country and said: "I will always remember my first cap.

"The first competition I participated in, in 2006, was a great one with unforgettable moments.

"If you decide to be a professional football player, it is in order to live moments like this. We didn't win but I learnt many things from this competition."

Abidal's retirement comes in the same week as that of former Barca and France team-mate Thierry Henry, though the former insists the timing is mere coincidence.

"Thierry Henry is a great player and I have not achieved even half of what he did in his career," he said.

"He's a great player, he decided personally to retire now and it's a pure coincidence we decided in the same moment."
