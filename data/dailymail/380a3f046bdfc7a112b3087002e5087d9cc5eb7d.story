Three Tibetans died on Wednesday in the latest self-immolation protests against Chinese rule.

Two monks, Lobsang Dawa, 20, and Konchog Woeser, 23, set themselves on fire in Ruo'ergai county in the Aba prefecture, while a third woman, 23, died in nearby Rangtang.

The two monks set themselves alight in an assembly hall at the Taktsang Lhamo Kirti monastery, where they died, but details of the female protester's death are not yet known.

The monks at the monastery held prayers for the two who died before their bodies were to be cremated today.

Self-immolations in Tibet have become so common in recent months that they happen on an almost weekly basis.

There have been 110 self-immolation protests in the fight for an independent Tibet since the first was reported in 2009.

The
protests, which sees individuals douse themselves in flammable liquid 
and set themselves alight, are reportedly inspired by the acts of 
Buddhist monks during the Vietnam war in the 1960s.

Tibetans currently have no legal recourse to protest against Chinese rule, making traditional demonstrations impossible.

Those who do face severe repercussions, with reports of physical assaults on Tibetans by Chinese security forces.

The monastery has become a focal point for protests over the past few months.

Another two monks died there recently. Kunchok Phlegay set himself on fire there in December last year and Lobsang Thogme in March this year.

More than 110 Tibetans have self-immolated since 2009 to protest against Chinese rule and to call for the return of their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, from exile.

Opposition to Chinese rule led to a violent uprising in 1959, when Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, fled to India.

China claims that Tibet has always been part of its territory, although Tibet has enjoyed long periods of autonomy.

In March another woman, identified as
Kalkyi, a 30-year-old mother of four, set herself alight near monastery
in the same Aba prefecture in eastern Tibet.

She died at the scene and was taken to Jonang Tibetan Buddhist monastery.

Aba has seen the largest number of self-immolation protests in Tibet.

The Dalai Lama has rejected the Chinese government's accusations that he orchestrates the protests.
