When a child goes missing, it is the realisation of every parents' worst nightmare.

But thankfully for five-year-old Jenson Lorey's parents, the panic was short lived when their son disappeared only to be found sleeping under a beanbag in their lounge.

The schoolboy was at the centre of a huge manhunt involving a dozen police officers, sniffer dogs and a helicopter when he vanished.

Despite bus drivers alerting one another over their radios to be on the look out for the missing boy, taxi drivers scouring the area and neighbours helping in the hunt, it was down to Jenson's six-year-old sister to find him.

Told to stay at the family home while the grown-ups went off hunting for her little brother, she lifted the red beanbag and to the joy of their parents discovered Jenson curled up asleep on the floor.

Here all along: Jenson Lorey, five, went missing and sparked a massive police hunt until he was found safe sleeping under a bean bag in his own home

His Mother, Samanatha, 28, said: 'I was out of my mind by then. We were fearing the worst.

'But my daughter moved our big bean bag and there he was - fast asleep underneath it.

'Jenson just looked peaceful but I was screaming with happiness. He was sleeping soundly when we found him under the big red bean bag in our living room.

'We were hugging him but he was completely unaware of what was going on.'

Jenson's distraught parents Samantha and Andrew told how they called police when their little boy went missing from the family home in Penlan, Swansea.

Relief: Jenson with his sister - and discoverer - Sienna, six, and his parents Sammy and Andrew at their home

Mrs Lorey, an office worker, said: 'I was at the gym with my friend and I came home to realised no-one had seen Jenson for 20 minutes.

'Andrew said he was in the kitchen and when he came out, Jenson was gone.

'I started screaming and running around the street - I thought the worst had happened.'

The family praised the police for their swift response to the missing child alert.

Andrew, 29, said: 'We had 12 police officers out looking for him, police dogs, and the helicopter. They searched the attic, they searched everywhere.

'Everyone who knew me was out looking but even people who didn't know me were looking too.

'The bus drivers were using their radios, and the taxi drivers were all looking.

'It was just incredible. The support we had was phenomenal.'

Jenson disappeared from his home at around 8.15pm on Monday and wasn't found until 9.45pm.

Sienna picked up the squashy red bean bag in their living room - but Jenson kept on snoozing.

Sammy said: 'I just didn't want to let him go - I can't stop hugging him.

'He cannot have been under the bean bag all that time because it was moved several times. All we know is that was sleeping soundly when we found him.'

Andrew said: 'Not even the sound of the sirens woke him up. It was the worst time you can imagine as a parent.

'I don't think he will go under that bean bag again.'

Inspector Phil Thomas, of South Wales Police, led the manhunt for the missing child.

He said: 'It just goes to show how strong the community spirit can be when faced with situations like this.

'We had a lot of resources and everybody in the area to help out. I'm just glad the little boy was found.'
