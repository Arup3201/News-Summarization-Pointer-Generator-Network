A Seaside town's plan to officially call a road Hitler's Walk has been scrapped after a flood of complaints.

Mevagissey Parish Council agreed the drop the planned sign after it attracted widespread condemnation.

The Jewish community had called on holidaymakers to boycott the town if the scheme went ahead. 

Decision reversed: Plans to officially rename a park in Mevagissey, Cornwall,  'Hitlers Walk' have been scrapped

The pathway, in Mevagissey, Cornwall, has been called Hitler's Walk unofficially for decades after an 'over-zealous park warden'. 

Old signs in Mevagissey, Cornwall were taken down in 2005 following a small number of complaints that the name was offensive.

Last month it was announced that the council had ordered a new sign, but it has now been cancelled. 

The controversy began earlier this month when the parish council decided to reinstate the Hitlers Walk nameplates, which were removed by Restormel Borough Council in 2005 after complaints they were offensive.

News of their decision came five days before the world marked the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp

Controversial: The old signs in Mevagissey, Cornwall were taken down in 2005 following a small number of complaints.

Harvey Kurzfield, of Kehillat Kernow, which represents the Jewish community of Cornwall, branded their plans 'ludicrous' and said he was 'astonished and perplexed as to why anyone in this day and age would put up a sign like that'.

But the council maintained that the sign was named after an over-officious 1930s park-keeper, and that the area - once called Cliff Park - had been referred to as Hitlers Walk ever since.

Liberal Democrat MP for St Austell and Newquay, Stephen Gilbert, said: 'This plan has caused huge offence to many people as well as attracting national and international condemnation and coming on the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the concentration camps it couldn't have been more insensitive.

'I'm pleased that the parish council have abandoned the plan and I am sure that sentiment will be shared by everyone whose family, like mine, fought against the Nazis and all those who rightly remain horrified at the mass extermination of Jewish people, disabled people, gay people and others that Hitler is responsible for.

'Respect, humanity and decency has prevailed at the Parish Council and the plan has gone where it belongs, in the bin.'

John Daniel, a councillor who supported the sign, reportedly told the Telegraph: 'The name goes back to a time before the war when whoever was in the charged of the park was a bit authoritarian. It's not offensive, it's just what local people call it.'
