Astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) can see as many as 16 sunrises and sunsets in a 24-hour period.

But on some occasions, the location of the station means the sun never sets at all, providing stunning views for the crew on board.

Now, Nasa astronaut Reid Wiseman has revealed this incredible sight from orbit, in the first ever Vine video to be sent from space.

In certain orbits of the Earth, the sun never sets on the ISS because the space station is in alignment with the day/night terminator line.

This line marks the barrier between light and dark on the surface of the Earth.

In this scenario, something known as the ‘beta angle’ increases. This is the imaginary line between the sun and the path of the ISS around Earth. 

When beta angle exceeds 69º, it is in constant sunlight. This happens two to four times a year and is most extreme near the summer solstice on June 21.

The timelapse condenses a 92-minute orbit into the span of around six seconds showing the space station hurtling around the planet at  17,500 mph (27,600 km/h).

Writing in the Weather Centre blog, Tony Rice explained that as the beta angle gets higher, the time the ISS is in sunlight also increases.

During this period, the so-called ‘beta angle’ increases. This is the imaginary line between the sun and the path of the ISS around Earth. As the beta angle gets higher, the time the ISS is in sunlight increases. When beta angle exceeds 69º, it is in constant sunlight

‘When beta angle exceeds 69º, it is in constant sunlight, and mission control keeps an even closer around-the-clock watch on power production and temperatures,’ he said.

‘This happens two to four times a year but is most extreme near the summer solstice coming on June 21.’

Previous space shuttles would enter something known as a ‘barbeque mode’ which would cause them to do slow barrel rolls to avoid overheating.

On the ISS, an Active Thermal Control System transfers heat through to large radiators extending under the station that can then be released into space.

‘1st Vine from space! Single Earth orbit. Sun never sets flying parallel w/terminator line,’ Wiseman explained in the clip, which he shared over the weekend.

Vine is a mobile service that creates short looping videos which are six seconds or less. So far, Wiseman’s Vine has gained over 4,000 likes and nearly 2,000 retweets.

The last time Twitter saw a space ‘first’ was when astronaut Mike Massimino sent the first tweet from orbit in 2009.

'My parents were waving in Maryland at sunrise, so I took a picture of them,' Wiseman wrote with this shot
