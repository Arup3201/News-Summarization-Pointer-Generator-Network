A tenant who signed a lease to pay $10 a month for 50 years for a New York City apartment is being taken to court.

Jud Parker, 47, signed the deal for the West Village 1,400-square-foot duplex, which has two bedrooms and a back yard, in 2009.

But the new landlord Pari Dulac claims the elderly owner Wilfred Schuman had dementia when it was allegedly signed and has an affidavit from Schuman's brother who agrees his brother suffered from the condition.

Schuman, who died in 2010 in his seventies, had owned a pair of three-story town houses on a West Village street - he lived in the basement of one of them, reports the New York Post.

In a lawsuit filed in Manhattan Supreme Court last week Dulac claims Parker fooled Schuman and then subletted the apartment for $2,500 a month after his death.

But Parker, who grew up on the same street where Schuman lived, insists the lease was a 'gift' before he looked after Schuman.

'[Dulac] wants me out because she's greedy,' he added.

Dulac bought the the buildings from Schuman's estate this month for $2.75 million - she believes the apartment could be rented for $6,000 a month. 

The suit claims Parker manipulated Schuman into signing the lease or forged his signature and alleges in the years leading up to his death Schuman was treated for alcoholism, dementia and bleeding of the brain after a fall.

David Burnett, who lived above Schuman, and collected the rent on his behalf, said he had only seen Parker twice in 20 years except for a three-week period in 2009 when he visited more frequently.

Laurie Dowdeswell, who lived in the same townhouse, said Parker asked for Schuman in August 2010 and unaware that he had died, according to the lawsuit.

According to the suit, Parker then showed her the lease claimed it was his apartment before allegedly demanding that she sublet for $1,500 a month or vacate the apartment - her rent increased to $2,500 two years later.

'This lease is outrageous and unconscionable,' said Dulac's ­attorney Steven Sladkus.
