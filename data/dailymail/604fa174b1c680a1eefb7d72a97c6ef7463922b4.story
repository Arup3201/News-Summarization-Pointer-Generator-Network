Boyd Rankin has revealed he thought about quitting cricket following England's horrendous Ashes tour and says there was not a good atmosphere in the camp Down Under.

The Irish fast bowler made his debut during the final Test in Sydney but went into the match with a shoulder injury and was forced off the pitch twice by bouts of cramp brought on by nerves.

Rankin, 29, said: 'I felt I had to play. I had to take my chance, but I don't suppose I did that, really,' he told espncricinfo.com. 'I tried to fight hard through that. It was still a special occasion for me, but I did feel I let myself and the rest of the team down. It's been tough coming back from that.

Cramping up: Rankin had to leave the field twice during his ill-fated Test debut

'It was a tough period for me when I got back. There were a few days when I was thinking, "Should I still be playing cricket?" There were quite a few questions asked. But I learned a lot from the experience and I believe it has made me a stronger person. '

'All I can do now is put in some strong performances and see what happens. I know, deep down, what I can do.'

Rankin, in action for Warwickshire in their LV= County Championship match against Somerset, also added that he did not enjoy his Ashes tour, aside from making his debut.

He said: 'It wasn't a great environment to be in. It was a really tough tour to be on. A lot of the lads were struggling.'
