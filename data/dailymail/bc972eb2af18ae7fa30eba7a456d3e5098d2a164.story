Spyhunters in Germany have arrested a middle-aged Russian couple it says were espionage agents for Moscow who operated under the radar of the intelligence services for two decades.

The married spooks - identified in Germany as Andreas and Heidrun Anschlag - allegedly sent back their reports to their handlers via a radio code.

German media reports said the arrest of Heidrun Anschlag was like a scene from a cold war movie - she was tapping out a message back to Russia in her home in Balingen when an armed task force broke in and arrested her mid-transmission.

The arrests come at a time of heightening tensions with the SWR - the spy agency which replaced the Soviet-era KGB - in the world.

In the UK Katia Zatuliveter, 26, is accused of seducing Lib Dem MP Mike Hancock into a four-year affair in order to gain intelligence secrets and the FBI is still investigationg a ten-strong 'deep cover' spy ring in suburban America it busted last year.

It was also revealed the pair, both aged 51, had contact to agent OOX - sexy spy Anna Chapman who was among the sleeper cell that the FBI broke up.

Investigators said it was due to information gleaned from the interrogations in America that led to the arrests of the spy duo in Germany.

Andreas and Heidrun were reportedly throwbacks from the Soviet era who stayed on in reunited Germany to serve new masters after the same old secrets - industrial, technological and military.

Both were arrested on Tuesday last week, Andreas while he was on an alleged business trip in the university city of Marburg.

Two Austrian passports, both said to 
be forgeries made by the counterfeiters of the SWR, were seized when 
they were taken into custody.

GS9-G commandos - the elite of the German police trained by former officers of Britain's SAS regiment - made the arrests.

The
bogus passports stated that Andreas was born in Argentina and Heidrun 
in Peru. Checks with authorities in both nations proved them to be 
fakes.

'The accused are
suspected of having worked in Germany over a long period of time for a 
foreign intelligence agency,' the federal prosecutor said in a 
statement.

'The Federal Crime Office (BKA) is investigating.' The BKA is Germany's equivalent of the FBI.

The news of the arrests brought back a little flavour of the cold war to the country that for 40 years was in the front line had it ever turned hot.

Thousands of spies from communist East Germany - itself a puppet of Moscow - infiltrated West Germany, working in government offices, the

Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin was a former KGB spy who was stationed in Dresden in the socialist east from 1985 to 1990.

The German Office for the Protection of the Constitution says the SWR has 13,000 overseas agents active.

Russia and China are named by it as the busiest spies at large in the west. Satellite, sensor and communications technology are the three most sought-after prizes although it remains unclear what sort of espionage the married couple were precisely enaged in.
