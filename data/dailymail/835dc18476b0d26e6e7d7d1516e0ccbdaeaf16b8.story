'Killer': Sylvia Majewska, 65, is accused of killing her son and then fatally beating his baby daughter

A 'controlling' mother killed her adult son with a boxcutter then fatally beat his seven-month-old daughter because she believed they would be better off dead, police have said.

Sylvia Majewska, 65, was arraigned in her hospital room on Monday. After the murders at her Oxford Township, Michigan home on November 23, she had tried to take her life by slicing her arms.

Daryne Gailey, 29, who had learning disabilities and suffered seizures,  and his seven-month-old daughter, Charley Hendrick, were found dead by authorities carrying out a welfare check after Gailey failed to return the little girl to her mother.

They found Charley tucked up in her crib, dead from blunt force trauma to the head, and discovered her father in the bathroom with a deep laceration from a boxcutter to his neck.

The baby's body was found by deputies 'dressed and tucked away like it was going to sleep – very sad,' Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard said, the Detroit Press reported.

Majewska was on the couch with her arms slit and was 'bleeding into a bucket', Bouchard said. The box cutter was nearby.

Oakland County authorities believe that Majewska attacked her son, who took medication before bed, in his sleep and then beat her granddaughter before slashing her arms. 

Bouchard said Majewska 'came to the conclusion that the son and the child would be better off if they weren't alive'.

Murdered: Daryne Gailey, 29, who had learning disabilities and suffered seizures, and his seven-month-old daughter, Charley Hendrick, were found killed inside his mother's home on November 23

Loss: Baby Charley, left and right with her mother Amanda, was found tucked up in her crib after she died

Split: The couple were married for just six months before they split. Gailey's mother filed his paperwork

Bouchard said investigators found several handwritten notes and other documents in the case. They found a new baby seat with a receipt, suggesting Majewska was planning to return it, police said.

Authorities added that she was apparently a controlling mother to her mentally impaired son.

'We certainly have information that she was an angry woman and a controlling woman,' he said, citing surveillance video showing the mother and son's interaction inside a store before the murders.

'She was very much in charge, berating him, in that encounter in the store,' he said.

Following the deaths, it emerged that Gailey had filed for divorce only six months after his August 2013 wedding to Charley's mother, Amanda Gailey. The divorce was finalized three weeks before the death.

And more recently, Majewska had filed for a protection order on her son's behalf against his ex, although it was lifted in July, the Free Press reported. It is not clear why it was lifted.

'Controlling': Majewska also accused Amanda of acting violently towards her son, which she has denied

Scene: Authorities found the bodies after Gailey failed to return his daughter to her mother in November

In the protection order, Majewska claimed that Amanda Gailey had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had kicked him in the groin and thrown a cell phone at him, according to court records.

Gailey has denied the allegations.

Majewska, who was her son's guardian due to his learning disabilities, sought to get her son's marriage annulled in January, saying he did not have the understanding to marry.

The following month, the baby was born and Amanda Gailey was given full and legal custody of the baby girl. Daryne Gailey was allowed to see his daughter every other Friday with his mother present.  

Gailey had worked as a clerk at a Kroger grocery store in Lake Orion for 15 years, employees said. They told the Free Press that he 'had a big heart'.
