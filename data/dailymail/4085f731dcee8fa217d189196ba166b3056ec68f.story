Pressure mounted on Nick Clegg to hold an independent inquiry into the Cyril Smith paedophilia scandal last night as Paddy Ashdown became the fourth Liberal Democrat leader to deny knowledge of the abuse.

Opposition MPs accused the Deputy Prime Minister of putting up a smokescreen by claiming he knew nothing of Smith’s vile activities because they occurred before his party existed in its current form.

Lord Ashdown, who led the Lib Dems from 1988 to 1999, yesterday insisted he did not know of the 29-stone late Liberal MP’s serial abuse of boys while he was at Westminster.

Ashdown was elected to Parliament in 1983 and retired in 2001. Smith served as Liberal and later Lib Dem member for Rochdale from 1972 to 1992.

This meant they would have been part of a small group of Liberal or Lib Dem MPs for nine years.

Lord Ashdown told the Daily Mail: ‘You ask whether I was aware of allegations about Cyril Smith during the time you refer to. The answer is no.’

Mr Clegg, former party leader Charles Kennedy and Vince Cable, who was acting leader for three months in 2007, have already said they had no idea Smith was a predatory paedophile over four decades.

But Simon Danczuk, the current Labour MP for Rochdale whose explosive book serialised in the Mail last week revealed the scale of Smith’s abuse, said the Lib Dems still had questions to answer.

‘Nick Clegg needs to initiate an investigation into why the Liberal Party or the Liberal Democrat Party – call it what you want – had a paedophile at the heart of the party for at least 20 years,’ he said. ‘It is just not good enough to say that nobody knew about this.

‘How can he say nobody knew when the reality is that former Liberal MPs, candidates, councillors and even the former leader of the party on Rochdale Council say they were all aware?’

Mr Danczuk attacked Mr Clegg for attempting to shake off the scandal by saying the Liberal Democrat Party, which came into being in 1988, was separate from the old Liberal Party.

He said: ‘They are one and the same thing. There is complete continuity. Using this argument gives the impression of a smokescreen, that Clegg is distancing himself from what went on before.’

Tim Loughton, former Tory children’s minister, said the number of unanswered questions was growing daily and added his voice to calls for a ‘proper inquiry’.

‘The more that comes out about this story, the more it’s clear that a number of people knew something was wrong at the time,’ he said. ‘Suspicions about a cover-up grow.

‘The only way to assure the public that justice is being done to those victims is for everyone who knows anything to come forward before a formal inquiry, so that all possible lines can be followed to see who knew what when, and who needs to be held responsible for allowing Cyril Smith to get away with this for so long.’

Monstrous cover-up: From the Mail, April 11

Lib Dem alibis fall apart: April 15

The Times used its leader column this week to criticise Mr Clegg’s claim that nobody in his party was aware of the abuse as ‘not good enough’ and ‘demonstrably not true’.

The paper said: ‘What the Liberal Democrats knew and when they knew it about Smith’s assaults is a matter of urgent public interest and a gathering scandal. Mr Clegg’s answers have so far been legalistic and unconvincing.’

The Deputy Prime Minister paid tribute to Smith at his 80th birthday in 2008, calling him a ‘beacon’ and an ‘inspiration’.

Last week he said Lib Dem whips had contacted every current MP and peer and trawled through the party’s archives after Mr Danczuk exposed Smith’s abuse in Parliament in 2012.

No one admitted hearing about the allegations – even though former Liberal leader David Steel was told in 1979 about complaints Smith had abused boys.

Lord Steel, who nominated Smith for a knighthood in 1988, has not responded to the latest revelations about the scandal.

He has previously said he received no complaints about Smith’s activities as a Liberal MP and that the obese politician denied any wrongdoing when he questioned him in 1979 about the allegations of ‘unusual behaviour with boys’.

Zac Goldsmith, Tory MP for Richmond Park, said the Lib Dems should have pursued the allegations ‘far more vigorously’, adding that a ‘full-scale and properly resourced investigation is long overdue’.

A Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘Cyril Smith’s acts were vile and repugnant and we have nothing but sympathy for those whose lives he ruined. His actions were not known to or condoned by the Liberal Party or the Liberal Democrats.

‘These are extremely serious allegations and include suggestions that there was a cover-up by the police and security services … Such serious allegations … must be a matter for the police.’

For ten days the Mail has led the way in reporting how the Lib Dems have gone into a state of denial about the appalling acts of sex abuse committed by MP Cyril Smith over four decades, exposed in our serialisation of Simon Danczuk’s book. Initially, other media were reluctant to pursue the story, but on Monday The Times ran a leader comment on the affair headlined ‘Silent Witness’. The following is an abridged version:

When Sir Cyril Smith died in 2010, Nick Clegg described him as ‘one of the most likeable politicians of his day’. That depended on where you sat. Vulnerable children whom Smith sexually abused over 40 years are unlikely to have shared Mr Clegg’s judgment. What the Liberal Democrats knew and when they knew it about Smith’s assaults is a matter of urgent public interest and a gathering scandal. Mr Clegg’s answers have so far been legalistic and unconvincing.

Smith’s covert life as a paedophile has emerged into the public spotlight in the past week owing to a new book co-authored by Simon Danczuk. It expands upon allegations Mr Danczuk made in the House of Commons in 2012. Yet it is literally incredible that the party in which Smith was a huge figure should have been uniformly unaware of them. Mr Clegg said last week that his party had been unaware of this appalling history, and added: ‘Many of the actions, the repugnant actions, which we now learn about took place well before the party I now lead even existed — in fact, took place before I even existed.’

That is a casuistical distinction between the Liberal Democrats and the 
old Liberal party. Nor is the claim of ignorance plausible. Smith had 
been chief whip of the Liberals’ very small parliamentary presence in 
the 1970s. Despite a mass of corroborating evidence … he was knighted in
 1988 and retired as an MP in 1992. He continued to abuse children as 
late as the 1990s. Since Smith’s death, the Crown Prosecution Service 
has admitted culpability in failing to prosecute him. Mr Clegg correctly
 says the police will need to investigate what happened. He and his 
colleagues also need to exercise historical accountability, however, and
 explain how Smith got away with a catalogue of depravity.

There is a
 terrible parallel with the activities of Jimmy Savile, the entertainer 
now known to have been a prolific child abuser. Savile and Smith 
operated in, respectively, the BBC and the Liberal Democrats, which 
celebrated their fame till their deaths and afterwards. Mr Clegg must 
account for how this happened. It is not good enough, for it is 
demonstrably not true, to maintain that nobody knew.
