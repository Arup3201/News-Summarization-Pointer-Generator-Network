Love taking selfies, shedding pounds on the 5:2 diet and finding love on Tinder? Sorry, you're officially uncool.

Socks and sandals, pheromone dating parties, 'Voga' and hybrid food were today hailed as the coolest new trends of 2014, while Selfies, hot yoga, the 5:2 diet and app dating are going down in the style stakes.

A new 'cool report' found Brits are increasingly looking to street styles and sub cultures to dictate their own trends rather than follow the opinion formers of the past.

Sorry Kim, you're officially uncool! A new 'cool report' has asked Brits to vote for what's hot for 2014 - and selfies are out

The research revealed that 68 per cent of those polled voted Selfies, a celebrity social media staple, as well as smartphone dating craze, Tinder, as 'not cool'.

Instead, life drawing classes and pheromone parties, the latest dating craze where people pick out a partner based on their natural smell, are considered cool by over three quarters of twenty something Brits.

When it comes to fashion, 73 per cent of those polled think Birkenstocks, and the socks paired with sandals trend are two of the coolest looks.

While dungarees and bum bags have recently been hailed 'must-haves' for pulling off the oh-so-now 90s throwback trend, the report classed them as items to leave at the back of the wardrobe in 2014 with over 87 per cent of people voting these as 'not cool'.

The research also found that the kale phenomenon is well and truly over in the eyes of the public, as is the restrictive 5:2 diet. In its place is a celebration of food with hybrid concoctions such as ramen burgers, and baking both hailed as cool by over 70 per cent of those in their twenties.

And it's not just food we're looking to have fun with, when it come to fitness, the gruelling 'hot yoga' trend - loved by celebs such as Gwyneth Paltrow - scored low on the cool barometer and has been replaced with 'Voga', which has been deemed cool by 86 per cent of those asked.

Popular: On average, users open the Tinder app seven times a day - with almost a billion matches since it launched 18 months ago - but sorry hopeful romatics, it's no longer cool

The brand new subculture of fitness is a cross between yoga and voguing - the 1980s New York drag scene dance craze - and encourages people to inject enjoyment into their fitness regime. 

A spokesperson for Vapestick, who conducted the research, said: 'What's really interesting is that historically trends have been established by celebrities, high fashion and opinion formers and then trickled down into the mainstream.

'However today it seems street style and subcultures are dictating the trends, which are now filtering up.

'The Vapestick Cool Report has proved that the power lies with everyday people and today's twenty-somethings aren't waiting around to be told what's cool and what's not, they're establishing that for themselves.'
