Fears: World Health Organisation director Margaret Chan

Antibiotics will soon become so ineffective that  a sore throat or grazing  your knee could kill, the World Health Organisation has warned.

The microbes that cause the most common infections are starting to resist the drugs, meaning conditions will become much harder to treat.

This will make remedies more expensive, and some conditions could even become untreatable.

WHO director general Margaret Chan said that the world was  fast approaching the ‘post-antibiotic era’.

She said the chances of changing this were ‘dim’ and expressed  concerns that the production line of more resistant drugs was  ‘virtually dry’.

‘A post-antibiotic era means, in effect, an end to modern medicine as we know it,’ she said.

‘Things as common as strep throat or a child’s scratched knee could once again kill.

‘Some sophisticated interventions, like hip replacements, organ transplants, cancer chemotherapy and care of pre-term infants, would become far more difficult or even too dangerous to undertake.’

Dr Chan added: ‘Antimicrobial resistance is on the rise in Europe, and elsewhere in the world. Replacement treatments are more costly, more toxic, need much longer durations of treatment and may require treatment in intensive care units.’

At the launch of a WHO book on the subject in Copenhagen, Dr Chan told a group of infectious disease experts that the ineffective nature of many antibiotics was because of ‘misuse’.

She said overuse of antibiotics had contributed to the resistance of diseases and set out a number of ways to ease the situation.

The WHO boss told the meeting more care should be taken to ensure that prescriptions are only given out when absolutely necessary.

And she added that antibiotics should not be used in food production. Developing countries are particularly susceptible to infections which are becoming resistant to antibiotics.

Dr Chan said that the worsening situation is at risk of being ignored.

She said: ‘One problem is that  the threat of antimicrobial resistance is competing for attention in a world beset by one global crisis after another.

These days, doomsday scenarios are a dime a dozen.’

Overused: As well as being prescribed to treat illnesses, antibiotics are commonly used in food production

According to the World Health Organisation – the public health arm of the United Nations – several countries have already introduced measures to quell the overuse of antibiotics.

The organisation is calling for such policies to be implemented globally.

It said that the treatment of tuberculosis globally had already identified the limitations of certain antibiotics.

Of the 12million cases recorded  in 2010, about 650,000 involved strands that were resistant to multiple drugs.

The health body said that even with the highest standards of care and medication, only 50 per cent of sufferers survived.

The European Union says it already ‘has its eyes wide open’ to the issue and has compiled a five-year action plan with 12 areas for improvement.

Medical experts in developing countries such as Vietnam and Thailand have also introduced schemes to reduce the number of antibiotics being prescribed.
