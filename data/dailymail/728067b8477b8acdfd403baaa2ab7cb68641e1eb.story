A father who was accused of gunning down the drunk driver who killed his two sons on a rural road in 2012 has been found not guilty.

David Barajas, 32, and his family broke down in tears as the decision was read in court in Angleton, Texas on Wednesday. It had taken the jury just three hours to reach their decision.

'I am relieved but still in pain,' Barajas said after the verdict. 'My two boys are dead and nothing will bring them back.'

The bereaved father had faced a murder charge for shooting dead Jose Banda after the 20-year-old driver killed his sons, 11-year-old Caleb and 12-year-old David Jr. The boys had been helping to push their family's broken-down car when they were struck near Alvin, Texas in December 2012.

Relief: David Barajas, who was accused of killing a driver who fatally knocked down his two sons along a rural Texas road in 2012, gets a kiss from his wife Cindy after he was acquitted of murder on Wednesday

Pained: Barajas, between his wife Cindy and his attorney Sam Cammack on Wednesday, said that while he was relieved about the verdict, he was still struggling with the loss of his two sons

Prosecutors had claimed that Barajas, overcome with rage, then returned home, retrieved a gun and fatally fired at the driver, who had a blood alcohol level twice the legal limit. 

They argued that while Bandas may have caused the deadly crash, he did not deserve to die in a 'revenge' killing.  

But the prosecution had faced a challenge in the courtroom, as none of the witnesses had been able to identify Barajas as the shooter and no gunpowder residue was found on Barajas' hands. 

Prosecutors had also faced overwhelming sympathy for Barajas. Many residents in Alvin, 30 miles southeast of Houston, supported him, while some have said they might have done the same thing in a similar situation.

A murder weapon was also never recovered. Bullet fragments were found in Bandas' car, but investigators testified that an empty holster found in Barajas' home would not have carried a gun that could have shot the bullets. 

Another investigator, Kent Nielson, testified that he found at Barajas' house a home security system that had a missing hard drive. Investigators have said security cameras outside of Barajas' home could possibly have captured video of someone entering or leaving the home after the crash.

But when questioned by Cammack, Nielson said he didn't know if the security system was working on the night of the accident.  

Barajas' attorneys had faced a battle too as they never offered another suspect who could be responsible for the killing.

One of his attorneys, Sam Cammack, told jurors his client did not kill Banda and was instead focused only on saving his sons the night they were hit. Barajas would not have had the time to go back and retrieve a gun, he said.

Dominick Sanders, the lead investigator with the Brazoria County Sheriff's Office, told jurors during the trial that the search of Barajas' home failed to find any evidence 'that made a direct link from (Barajas) to the crime scene'.

Cammack asked Sanders if he could tell jurors who shot Banda and Sanders said he didn't have any direct knowledge on who did it.

'What in the heck are we doing here?' Cammack said.

During the testimony, dash-camera video from a deputy's patrol vehicle was also played and Cindy Barajas, the boys' mother, could be heard screaming, 'No, not my babies.' 

If he had been convicted, Barajas would have faced life in prison.
