For most people reaching a weight loss goal is an excuse for a celebratory night out, a spa day, or maybe even a new wardrobe.

But for one brave mother-of-two losing nearly 8st meant she was finally able to take part in her dream charity event: a daring sky dive.

Donna Shaw, 28, from Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, weighed more than 18st when she applied to a do a skydive to fundraise for the Alzheimer's Society after her grandmother died of the disease.

At her largest Donna was forced to sit on the sidelines  at a theme park as she was too large to fit on any of the rides

But after realising that her large frame meant she'd never be able to do the jump, Donna was spurred into losing 7st 12lb and slimming down to a size 10.

Donna said: 'I was distraught when I found out that I was too big to do the jump - I knew I had to do something.

'Now I'm down to a healthy weight I feel so much better, and it's meant I've finally been able to raise money with my skydive.'

Shop assistant Donna spent years struggling with her weight and used to gorge on takeaways for lunch and dinner.

Donna's impressive weight loss was spurred on by her desire to complete a skydive for the Alzheimer's Society (pictured left holding her skydive certificate and right, in cream, heading to the plane)

Donna struggled with comfort eating and despite trying many fad diets, saw her weight continue to creep up

Prior to finding out she was over the maximum weight for the skydive Donna had already been on the receiving end of an embarrassing confrontation with a ride operator at a theme park.

While queueing for a ride on a day trip with friends, the attendant approached her to say that she would not be able to fit into the seats.

Mortified, Donna had to stand aside and wait while her friends whizzed around on rollercoaster after rollercoaster.

Breakfast: Nothing

Lunch: Sausages and cheesy chips or a McDonalds

Snacks: Creamy soup with six slices of bread with butter and two packets of crisps.

Dinner: Takeaway: Indian or Pizza. Plus leftovers from daughter's meals.

Evening snack: Cheese on toast

Breakfast: Weetabix or porridge

Lunch: Chicken salad and an apple or an orange with a yoghurt.

Dinner: A Cambridge Weight Plan recipe for example: 400 calorie Toad in the hole, low fat Chile con carne, healthy lasagne.

Snacks: Nothing  

 

After applying for the skydive and realising there was no chance of her size 22 body fitting into the jumpsuits Donna began a radical diet in a bid to finally slim down.

She chose the rather drastic method of using meal replacement soups and shakes from the Cambridge Weight Plan and managed to slim to a size 10, now weighing 10st 4lb.

Succeeding in her weight loss meant she was finally able to do her charitysky dive, raising £450 for the Alzheimer's Society.

Donna said: 'Every time my weight came to be a problem I pushed it aside and hoped it would disappear.

Donna, pictured here before and after she embarked on the diet, says her weight loss has dramatically increased her energy levels

'But after I looked into doing a skydive and realised I'd be too big I couldn't do it anymore.

'The Alzheimer's Society is a charity really close to my heart and it was awful when I found out there wasn't anything I could do.

'I was exhausted, with two children under two, and I was carrying loads of extra weight,

'It was affecting my kids because I wasn't able to play with them as energetically as I used to.

'I was just too tired to be a good mum and even my husband Michael had noticed the difference in me.

'I was comfort eating after my grandmother's death, finishing the kids' leftovers, and before I knew it the weight has just piled on.

'I never knew when to stop and when was enough.

'I wanted to be a happy and so I took action and turned my diet, and my life, around.

'When I look back at pictures now it's crazy to see how big I was.

'Now it's such a great feeling knowing that my weight will never hold me back and I can wear whatever I want.'
