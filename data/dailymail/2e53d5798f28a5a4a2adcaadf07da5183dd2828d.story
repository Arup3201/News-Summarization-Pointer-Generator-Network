A woman who left a hair dryer 
running to warm her infant daughter on a freezing night has pleaded no 
contest to involuntary manslaughter in the baby's death.

Brigit Hippen, of Hutchinson, Kansas,
had been scheduled to go on trial Tuesday for a second time on a charge
of second-degree murder. 

Instead, she pleaded to the lesser charge in Reno County District Court.

Involuntary manslaughter: Brigit Hippen fell asleep after leaving the hair dryer running in the crib

Hippen faces anything from three to 11 years in prison.

She will be sentenced on February 24 - two years and one day after two-month-old Karina Perez died of hyperthermia.

Hippen told investigators she placed a running hair dryer near Karina's crib to keep the baby warm, then fell asleep. 

Doctors have said Karina's temperature was 108 when she died.Hippen's first trial ended in a mistrial.

Hippen still faces trial for a separate case in which she is charged with felony criminal damage to property and misdemeanor battery in a separate incident. The trial in that case is tentatively set for February 28.

This case centres on an incident which occurred on May 29 of last year, when she allegedly punched another woman in the face for dancing with her boyfriend.

Hippen is also caused of damaging the woman's car.
