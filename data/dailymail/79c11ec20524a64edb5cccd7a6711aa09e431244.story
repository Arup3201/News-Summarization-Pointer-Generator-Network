Ralph Ellis runs you through what we learned from the weekend's football... with some star turns and a look through the leagues, too. This week includes Jack Rodwell failing to make an impact against Watford, Adel Taarabt continuing to frustrate and Craig Noone's resurrection under Solskjaer.

1) Jack Rodwell’s £12million move to Manchester City has been an 18-month nightmare of niggling injuries and lack of action even when he has been fit.

The 22-year-old has changed his car and moved house to try to solve his persistent hamstring problems since leaving Everton.

Any hope that getting picked against Watford in the FA Cup might turn the tide for him proved a big let down, however.

Manuel Pellegrini said he wished he could have subbed all 11 players at half time when the Championship side were leading 2-0 – but it was Rodwell and Micah Richards who were the pair that did get the hook.

2) Mark Schwarzer celebrated his 41st birthday back in October but continues to justify Chelsea’s decision to give him a one-year contract as cover to Petr Cech.

The 1-0 win over Stoke meant the 6ft 5in goalkeeper has now kept five clean sheets in his six appearances since moving to Stamford Bridge.

That’s one more than Fulham, who ditched him in the summer after signing Maarten Stekelenburg despite his 220 appearances, have managed all season.

3) Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino made six changes for the clash with Yeovil to give some stars a break before this week’s Premier League matches with Arsenal and Fulham.

But one man who didn’t get rested was newly-capped England striker Jay Rodriguez, who played all 90 minutes of the 2-0 win over Championship side Yeovil.

The 24-year-old, who won his first England cap in the November friendly against Chile, has appeared in every one of Saints’ games in all competitions this season.

The hamstring injury which kept Seamus Coleman out of Everton’s win at Stevenage means Rodriguez is now one of only three Premier League players who have appeared in every one of their club’s first-team games. The other two are Liverpool’s Jordan Henderson and Stoke skipper Ryan Shawcross – the only man to have started every match.

4) Winger Craig Noone played a key role in Cardiff’s promotion side but struggled to adapt to the demands of Premier League football – it was mid-December before he started a game.

But the 26-year-old from Kirkby, who has worked his way up from playing non-League football with Skelmersdale, looks like being a key man under Ole Gunnar Sokskjaer.

He was one of the stars of the show in the 1-0 win at Bolton, and has played in all the club’s last eight matches.

5) Adel Taarabt continues to be the most frustrating player in football. Sent on for the last 23 minutes by Fulham boss Rene Meulensteen following a red card for Sheffield United skipper Michael Doyle, he gave the ball away the first five times he touched it.

The Moroccan’s loan move from Queens Park Rangers has brought him just one goal, right back in August against Burton Albion.

At least Fulham rescued a replay against 10-man Blades on this occasion. The other five matches when Taarabt has been brought on from the bench have all ended in defeats.

6) Swansea skipper Ashley Williams has been linked with big clubs including Arsenal but looks likely to stay at the Liberty Stadium when the window shuts this week.

That’s good news for Swans boss Michael Laudrup, whatever the ambitions of the 29-year-old captain of Wales. He played Birmingham almost on his own in the first half at St Andrew’s – making five vital blocks including two goal-line clearances.

7) Leicester striker David Nugent appointed himself penalty taker for this campaign after watching youngster Anthony Knockaert miss the one at Watford that cost the Foxes a place in last year’s play-off final.

The 28-year-old has been deadly, with nine successful spot kicks so far – just one short of Arthur Rowley’s club record for penalties in a season set way back in 1953.

He should have reached that milestone on Saturday, but are nerves setting in? His tame effort was easily saved by Middlesbrough’s Shay Given.

8) Stephen Hunt’s starring role in Ipswich’s 2-0 win over Reading was a reward for his determination to rescue his career after it all went wrong at Wolves.

The 32-year-old Republic of Ireland midfielder signed at Portman Road in November on a short-term deal where he didn’t earn a penny unless he got picked for the Championship club’s team.

He’s now started two games and Ipswich have won them both, and he’s been given a proper contract that lasts until the end of the season.

9) Crewe’s tradition for open football, long established by Dario Gradi, comes with huge risks.

They defended better in the 1-0 defeat at Tranmere which left them just a point above the relegation zone in League One, having played two more games than 21st placed Sheffield United.

But their goal difference is now an astonishing minus 27 – the worst of any of the 92 clubs.  Premier League Fulham are on minus 26.

10) They say teams reflect their manager, and Fleetwood are a good example given the reputation for commitment and determination their boss Graham Alexander gained in his playing days at Preston and Burnley.

They won 4-2 at Burton to go third in League Two, despite putting up with an hour’s delay to kick off while torrential rain was cleared from the pitch, and then scoring two own goals.

Alexander’s side will need the same character again tonight.  With barely 48 hours break they travel to face leaders Scunthorpe for the benefit of the Monday night TV cameras.
