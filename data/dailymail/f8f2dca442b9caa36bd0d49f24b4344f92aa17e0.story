The bad news is there’s no cure for a hangover. But that doesn’t mean the majority of us won’t wake up with one in two days’ time.

Most will reach for painkillers and the coffee pot, but what of the other tried-and-tested remedies?

Who better to consult than celebrities who need to ensure they not only feel better but look red-carpet-ready after a heavy night. Here we speak to the stars to discover how they cope the morning after the night before.

Top tips: Nigella Lawson recommends her own recipe for Eggs in Purgatory, Nancy Dell'Olio goes for a strong cup of espresso whilst singer Katie Melua prefers a classic burger with HP sauce

DENISE VAN OUTEN 38, TV presenter

My quick fix is a banana,  a can of Coke and a stroll on our local beach, Camber Sands in East Sussex.

KATIE MELUA 28, singer

The old Soviet countries have some weird hangover cures, such as a raw egg swallowed in one and ‘sodium water’ drinks, but I’m not a fan of that so I prefer a full English breakfast or a dirty burger – really fatty plus plenty of chips, Coke on the side and HP sauce.

LEN GOODMAN 68, Strictly Come Dancing judge

Drink at least a pint of water before you go to sleep. Always lock the wardrobe in case you confuse it for the bathroom. If on waking you are hung over, two pickled walnuts and a glass of Ribena will either kill or cure you.

Take a brisk walk in the fresh air to the nearest pub and consume exactly 50 per cent of what you had the night before. This won’t fully alleviate the symptoms but you’ll definitely feel better. Also, a warning: with each two units of alcohol consumed, a person of the opposite sex gets ten per cent more attractive.

Simple treats: Denise Van Outen's hangover cure includes the classic combination of a banana and a can of Coke topped off with a walk on the beach

NIGELLA LAWSON 52, cook

Try my Eggs in Purgatory recipe. I’m not saying that New Year’s Day has to mean you have a hangover, but after that evening of almost-enforced carousing, this dish of eggs cooked in a fiery tomato sauce can feel like heaven.

JAMES MIDDLETON25, brother of Kate and Pippa

I go for a run, then have a cappuccino and a piadina (an Italian flatbread sandwich) from La Bottega delicatessen in West London. It seems to do the trick.

Gollum style: The Hobbit actor Andy Serkis goes for a workout in the cold mountain air

ANDY SERKIS 48, actor

I
 find a really nice big hill and do some fell running up it. You get 
that combination of cold mountain air and burning lungs, so it is a 
great cure for a hangover.

BRIAN MAY65, Queen guitarist

Cure for a hangover? Don’t drink too much. It took me a long time to learn, but I did in the end. I drink but not to excess – there’s just no point. I don’t like that feeling in the morning. It’s not worth it.

NANCY DELL’OLIO51, lawyer

I like to eat oysters and drink very strong espresso when I have a hangover. If you know you have had a heavy night, you should sleep with all your make-up on so when you wake up you still look fantastic. I am a strong believer in mind over matter. If you believe you don’t have a hangover, then you won’t.

ERIN O’CONNOR34, model

I love – and can’t live without – Pukka Detox tea. It works every time. They also do an organic Clean Greens range, which is fabulous.

RAYMOND BLANC63, chef

My cure for a Christmas hangover is Chartreuse liqueur, which is distilled alcohol with 130 herbal extracts. My mum makes a homemade version, which cures all ailments. However, if you can’t get hold of this, I’d recommended good old-fashioned Alka-Seltzer.

PRISCILLA PRESLEY 67, actress

Gentle
 exercise – some press-ups and push-ups. Put on some soothing or jolly 
music to feel better. And drink green tea and goji berry juice.

Smug May on New Year's Day: Queen legend Brian May will be feeling chirpy come Tuesday morning as he plans to stick to modest drinking

ARLENE PHILLIPS69, choreographer

Drink lots of pink lemonade and keep on drinking it. You’ll need to pop to the loo and you’ll pee out your entire hangover.

HELEN LEDERER58, comedian

The
 empirically proven aid when feeling like a blob with no brain power is 
to coat your tongue with astringent mouthwash, then glug a mug of hot 
water with lemon topped off with a plate-load of smoked salmon.

This 
de-blobs the system and makes you feel fragrant again. Whatever you do, 
don’t buy into the baked-beans-and-toast remedy – as therein flatulence 
beckons.

Middleton cure: James, brother of The Duchess of Cambridge, goes for an Italian sandwich

SARAH CRACKNELL45, singer

I
 recommend a swim in the sea. And I mean submerging yourself fully, no 
floating about on the surface.

Or if you don’t live near the coast, put 
the past behind you and stop feeling guilty. G

o for a fancy lunch, 
including more wine, followed by a lovely afternoon nap with the sun 
creeping around closed curtains. Heavenly!

PERDITA WEEKS 27, actress

A takeaway pizza, followed by a curry, followed by a Chinese. And ginger ale. T

he food doesn’t make you feel any better but it gives you something to do and takes your mind off feeling so rough. It’s a great time-waster ordering foods of the world.

It’s as if you’re on holiday but in the comfort of your own home.

NOELLE RENO29, model

There is an over-the-counter drug in the US called Midol – it’s specifically for PMS but it is the best thing to cure a hangover. It works as a painkiller but also has an anti-nausea ingredient that deals with the hangover symptoms. It makes it much more bearable.

AMBER ATHERTON20, model

Whole Foods Market in Kensington, West London, is the best hangover cure. I feel cleansed and zen just standing in the place. I buy brown rice sushi and have countless cups of green tea and migraine tablets.

ED HARCOURT35, singer

I have several equations depending on the type of hangover. Beer plus shots equals a hot steam, a roll in the snow then a game of chess. Tequila calls for steak frites, a rom-com in a cinema and some sex. And whisky plus red wine requires .  .  . death!

DR MAX PEMBERTON‘As is often the case in medicine, prevention is better than cure. I never drink on an empty stomach. If you do, you get drunk much faster and the hangover is worse. I always eat something with lots of carbohydrate, such as bread or pasta.

'Once at the party, I never mix drinks and before going to bed I have either scrambled eggs or an omelette with plenty of orange juice. I don’t know why it works but I’ve been doing it for years and it seems to do the trick.’

DR ELLIE CANNON, GP‘I make sure I don’t lie in, although that’s not too difficult when you have two young children, because sleeping lots or napping can leave you feeling more lethargic.

'To ensure I rehydrate myself, I add rehydration salts to water, which speeds up the process, and I take Motilium to quell the nausea.’

GILLIAN REEVES, PERSONAL TRAINER‘The best thing to do is drink water and rehydrate yourself the morning after. I wouldn’t recommend exercise in the morning as your body is dehydrated and intense activity will only add to this, give you a headache and make you feel sluggish afterwards.

'But don’t stay in bed. Light exercise later on such as a power walk, yoga or zumba can lift your mood. Alcohol is a depressant and can give you the blues the next day and a stroll will stimulate the release of the feel-good endorphin hormones.’DR CARRIE RUXTON, DIETICIAN‘I swear by Dioralyte rehydration powder mixed with Rowse Manuka 10+ honey and hot water. It contains rehydrating mineral salts, natural slow-release sugars plus antioxidants and fluid in one soothing mug.’
