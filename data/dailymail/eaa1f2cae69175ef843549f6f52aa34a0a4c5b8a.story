A thief was ordered to pay £25 compensation to a gardener after being caught stealing his 'honesty box' in a Welsh village.

Paul Bujega, faces six months of community service after he took the box, belonging to Mark Button, from an open fridge filled with the gardener's produce in Mewslade, Gower, South Wales.

Mr Button put the box in the fridge so that honest locals could pay for his homegrown fruit and vegetables.

But not only did Bujega fail to pay for the drinks he took, he went one step further by stealing the box itself.

Bujega, 37, had been at the beach with friends when they drove past the fridge.

In a bid to 'show off to his friends', he jumped out of the car and snatched the box, taking the £25 it contained with him. 

Bujega said he was trying to show off to his friends when he stole the box and its contents, taking canned drinks with him as well

Thankfully, Mr Button had installed CCTV cameras around the area in the event of any such theft.

After watching the implicating footage, Mr Button, 45, uploaded still photos of the crime to Facebook.

1,000 people shared the photos on the social networking website, prompting Bujega to hand himself into authorities.

The prosecutor said Bujega had broken the number one rule of country life which is being honest. Bujega must complete 6 months of community service for his crime

Mark Button (pictured) says he now calls the box Happy Days as it reminds him of a time when people were more honest

Prosecutor Anwen Evans said that he had broken the number one rule of country life which is honesty.

'Mr Button left an honesty box in the fridge so people could pay for his produce. He also put cans of drinks and ice cream in the fridge for local children coming back from the beach.

But Bujega was caught on a secret camera taking the honesty box and cans of fizzy drinks.

He told police his friends told him to steal the money after a trip to the beach to pay for their petrol home.'

Bujega's lawyer described the incident as 'a moment of madness', and put it down to the fact that the man from Pontarddulais, Swansea, had been drinking.

He was ordered to pay Mr Button £25 in compensation - the exact amount of money he had stolen.

Mr Button said: 'I call the honesty box Happy Days because it is a reminder of how things used to be in the countryside.

It’s great and we’re helping each other out, 99.9 per cent of people love it and respect it.

But for someone to just help themselves is disgraceful.'
