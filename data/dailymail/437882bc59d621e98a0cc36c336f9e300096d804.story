The Facebook effect: Prices in Palo Alto, near Mark Zuckerberg's swanky home, are steadily on the rise ahead of the company's IPO

This is something most Palo Alto homebuyers won’t ‘like.’

Ahead of Facebook’s estimated $79.3billion IPO – the biggest in Silicon Valley history – real estate prices are climbing, and are only expected to go higher after the company’s stock goes public.

Prices for houses in the area are already some of the steepest in the country, and are only estimated to go higher after soon-to-be Facebook millionaires swarm the market.

According to the New York Times, Palo Alto and the surrounding area is already a major hot spot of the housing market – despite poor sales in nearly every other part of the country.

On top of that, inventory – that is to say, the houses that are available for purchase – are down by as much as 57 per cent.

A full three years after becoming the world’s youngest billionaire, Zuckerberg himself took advantage of Palo Alto’s real estate market and bought a $7million, five-bedroom home with long-time girlfriend Priscilla Chan.

The property is said to be a ten-minute drive to Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park.

Before that, the social network creator was renting a more modest home, which his then-neighbours called ‘absolutely average.’

Silicon Valley real estate agent Ken DeLeon told the Times that he recently sold an 8,000-square-foot house to a Facebook employee.

They had upgraded from a modest 1,000-square-foot home. When Mr DeLeon saw the old property, he asked: ‘Did you win the lottery?’

And the practice, it seems, is not isolated to one or two employees of the social network.

According to real estate company Coldwell Banker, in 2011, eight out of 20 of the nation’s most expensive real estate locations were nestled in Silicon Valley.

Mr DeLeon said residents and prospective homebuyers in the area have several options ahead of the expected IPO. One, they can stay in their homes until the offering, and wait for their house’s value to climb.

Similarly, he predicted an influx of house-flippers – people who snatch up ‘fixer-upper’ houses at lower prices, upgrade them, and sell them for top dollar.

Location, location, location: The home has views of the sweeping hills, as well as the city, and offers plenty of natural light

Not all of this is good news. According to BrokerMetrics, the median-price of a home in Palo Alto went up 11 per cent last year, but inventory went down 57 per cent.

Recent listings on Trulia.com show most homes – including a comfortable but modest-looking three bedroom, two-bathroom ranch home – listed in the millions of dollars.

In the house’s description, the agent names the 1920’s cottage a ‘fixer in liveable condition with wonderful appeal.’

More luxe properties range anywhere from $1.5million up to more than $6million, for multi-bedroom estates. From the listings, the least expensive homes were around $270,000 – but had all been foreclosed, and are now owned by the bank.

Listings on Realtor.com showed much the same. A four-bedroom, four-bath home is selling for $4.6million, while $6.3million can get a brand-new house with five bedrooms and six baths on Washington Avenue.

New house smell: The house has 4,837 square feet and was built this year

National Association of Realtors Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement at the end of last month that 2012 has seen a moderate boom in housing.

‘The housing market has clearly turned the corner,’ Mr Yun said. ‘Rising sales are bringing down inventory and creating much more balanced conditions around the country, which means home prices will be rising in more areas as the year progresses.’

But, according to Fortune, there is another scenario at stake. If Facebook’s offering doesn’t earn as much as anticipated, the region’s housing market could spiral downwards – meaning that the housing burst that was experienced by most of the country would finally come to Silicon Valley.

Fortune also notes that ‘the Facebook effect’ may be bringing about secret sales. Rather than have a large ‘For Sale’ sign hammered in wide lawns (which many homeowners in the area find tacky), they sell their home through word-of-mouth.

This also means that pictures of their often lavish interiors and personal spaces aren’t splashed on web listings.

The private market also keeps dozens and dozens of potential buyers – and wishful gawkers – out of the property.
