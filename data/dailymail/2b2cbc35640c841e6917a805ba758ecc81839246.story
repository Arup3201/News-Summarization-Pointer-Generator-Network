A toddler died when his head became trapped between two stair gates intended to keep him safe in his family home, an inquest has heard.

Xander Stephenson, who was just two weeks from his second birthday, was left unable to breathe when he got his arm and neck wedged between the gates, which were installed to stop him falling down the stairs.

The little boy's mother found him in the doorway of his bedroom but, despite efforts to save him, Xander was pronounced dead at the scene.

An inquest has heard how toddler Xander Stephenson was 'strangled' just two weeks before his second birthday when he became trapped between two stair gates installed to stop him falling down the stairs of his home

A post mortem-examination showed that his cause of death had been asphyxia.

An inquest into the tragedy was told that Xander, of Poulton, near Blackpool, 
Lancashire, had become 'increasingly persistent and successful' at getting 
out of his room in the weeks leading up to the accident on September 13.

Despite already having a stair gate, he had used his toys to climb over it and managed to wander downstairs.

His mother, Samantha Pickford, 26, who was training to become a childminder, had feared for her son's safety and so borrowed a second gate to use above the one she already had, on the advice of other parents.

Miss Pickford told the hearing in Lancaster: 'Xander started climbing as soon as he could move really.

'In the last six months he began climbing out of his cot and would come into my room before we would go downstairs.

Persistent: An inquest into the tragedy heard that Xander had become 'increasingly persistent and successful' at getting out of his room in the weeks leading up to his death

'It got to a point where I would keep putting him back in his bed and every time he would climb out again, sometimes before I’d even left the room.

'One night he climbed out of the cot about 50 times and that is when I decided to put the first stairgate in.

'I didn’t want to put it at the top of the stairs because if I had and he had climbed over he would have fallen down the stairs.

'The
stair gate worked fine for a couple of months, until he started to use 
toys to climb over the gate. I tried taking the toys out, but eventually
he learned how to climb over the gate himself.

'One morning I came downstairs and he had emptied my washing powder all over the floor.

'He
had a spoon in his hand and was going to eat it. Another morning he had
emptied my frozen food all over the floor and was trying to eat it.

Adventurous: Xander's father Mark Stephenson said that the little boy loved exploring and would be sorely missed

'I
was looking for something to help me keep him in his bedroom because I 
was scared that I would come down one morning and I would find him 
dead.'

Miss Pickford then decided to use the second gate, however just 36 hours after it was installed, little Xander had managed to squeeze his arm and neck between the two gates.

The
bottom bolts on the top gate became loose, leaving the gate swinging 
and fixed by only two top bolts, trapping the boy between them.

Miss Pickford carried Xander downstairs in his pyjamas before lying him on the sofa.

She then ran into the street screaming when she told a passer-by, hairdresser Lindsay Kerry, that a stairgate had 'strangled' her son.

Paramedics were called and Miss Kerry tried to carry out CPR until the ambulance arrived.

However, despite the medics’ best efforts Xander was pronounced dead at the scene. 

Recording
a verdict of accidental death, Wyre Coroner Dr James Adeley said this 
was the first time he had come across such an accident.

He said: 'The presence of a second stair gate, to me, seems sensible after learning how adventurous Xander was.

'The position of the stair gate an inch and a half to two inches above the other also seems sensible.

'Miss Pickford, who is training for a qualification in childcare, had even checked that the gates were safe.

Paramedics rushed to try to help little Xander Stephenson but there was nothing they could do to save his life (file picture)

'I have been a coroner for nine and a half years,' Dr Adeley said.

'I have presided over some 22,000 deaths, and I have never come across a death involving a stair gate before.'He told Miss Pickford: 'You must not blame yourself. There is no evidence that getting to Xander a few moments earlier would have made any difference.'

In a statement Mark Stephenson, 33, Xander’s father, said that the youngster would be missed by everyone who knew him. 

He said: 'He was just a baby, not even two yet. Needless to say I am devastated and heartbroken.

'He was adventurous and loved exploring. He also loved Mickey Mouse. Xander will be sorely missed by everyone who knew him.

'I can’t sleep, I can’t imagine what I’m gonna do without my boy, my baby, my son.'
