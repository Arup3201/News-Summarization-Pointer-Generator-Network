Rush-hour commuters were left screaming and in tears today when a passenger fell under a London Underground train  - apparently after her coat became stuck in the doors.

Firefighters, police and paramedics raced to Clapham South station in south London just after 8am when the 28-year-old woman fell from travellers described as an ‘overcrowded’ platform.

She was taken to St George's Hospital with ‘non-life-threatening injuries’, but the incident led to huge queues for buses as Northern line services between Kennington and Morden were paralysed.

Witnesses told of fire crews hoisting up a Tube train to free the woman on the northbound platform, and claimed the woman was pulled underneath the train as it approached.

One 13-year-old girl, who watched the incident unfold, said on Twitter: 'Her coat got stuck in the Tube doors, she was dragged across the platform. I saw it all. Thank God she survived.'

NHS worker Jack Smith, 25, told the London Evening Standard: ‘I heard this prolonged scream from 20m (65ft) down the platform. There were loads of women around her screaming and pointing.'

James Callen, a corporate services executive, added: ‘As the Tube pulled in people inevitably shuffled forward and the woman was pushed under the tube.

'There were horrendous screams coming from her and the people who were standing around her. We were ushered out pretty quickly and it was complete chaos. A lot of people were crying as well.’

Cristina Squires, Channel 5 News editor, said on Twitter that she saw firemen trying to rescue the woman, and claimed they had to 'jack up the train'.

Waiting: Queues outside Balham station. Transport for London denied the incident was due to overcrowding

Sarah-Jane Peyton, a BBC EastEnders publicist, tweeted: 'Just been evacuated from a Tube at Clapham South after a poor woman was dragged underneath it. Horrible. Totally shaken up.'

Transport for London denied the incident was due to overcrowding. But one commuter, who travels to west London daily from the station, said this issue is a major problem at Clapham South.

He told MailOnline: ‘People are usually queuing back about ten people deep on the platform itself, and every train that arrives at the station is packed, so you have to squash on.

‘If you’re trying to board around 8.15am you’ll likely have to wait for five to ten trains in order to actually get on one, as barely one person can squeeze on at a time.

‘Sometimes the station gets so packed that they close access, because the platforms are so packed, and people have to queue outside until it is opened again.’

He added: ‘People push right up to the yellow line on the platform, so I’ve always thought there is a danger of falling onto the tracks if someone is just pushed slightly.'

Software designer Ben Oakenfull said on Twitter: 'Someone under a train at Clapham South. Not a surprise really as the platform gets so overcrowded. Time for TfL to look at safety.'

Nigel Holness, London Underground’s operations director, said: ‘Just before 8am this morning a passenger fell between the train and tracks at Clapham South station.

‘The passenger has been recovered by the emergency services with non-life-threatening injuries. There was no service from Morden to Kennington for around an hour, while the rest of the line had minor delays. The service has now resumed.’

He went on: 'The safety of customers and staff is our top priority and we do all we can to ensure customers can travel safely at all times. Thankfully incidents of this nature are extremely rare on our network and the Tube is one of the safest railways in the world.

'This follows heavy investment in safety improvements, and we are constantly seeking to further improve our excellent safety record.'

British Transport Police said the incident was 'not being treated as suspicious' and an investigation had been launched.

The London Fire Brigade said it sent two fire engines and a fire rescue unit, and helped recover the woman from the tracks.

A spokesman said: 'Firefighters used a "scoop stretcher" - a specialist piece of equipment - to bring her back to the platform before she was taken to hospital.'

An London Ambulance Service crew and air ambulance were also sent to the station, where the woman was treated before being taken to the hospital in Tooting. Her condition was not available.
