Wood's wheels: A Mercedes once owned by Natalie Wood is going up for auction in March and is expected to sell for $1.75 million

A stunning Mercedes originally owned by tragic Hollywood beauty Natalie Wood is expected to sell for $1.75 million at auction.

Wood was just 19 when she bought the brand-new Mercedes 300 SL Roadster in January 1958.

Her 300 SL Roadster was one of the most sought after and exclusive cars of the day thanks to its looks and stunning performance.

And the young starlet made it one of the most unmistakable motors in Hollywood after she had it repainted pink.

The Roadster, which is a convertible version of the iconic 300 SL 'Gullwing', is powered by a 3-litre engine developing 220bhp.

This gives the Mercedes a top speed of more than 150mph - making it one of the fastest cars of its day.

Wood's
 car, which has a red interior, also had the benefit of having the 
desirable Rudge wheels, with just 25 fitted by the factory.

The car was later resprayed back to its original silver blue and has undergone an award-winning restoration.

It is going to be sold by its current owner at RM Auctions' Amelia Island sale in Florida on March 8.

Experts at RM expect the car to sell for around $1.75million when it crosses the auction block.

Gord
 Duff, car specialist at RM Auctions, said: 'The 300 SL market is hungry
 for high-quality restorations with desirable factory options.

'This
 particular car's originality, rare Rudge wheels, celebrity provenance, 
touring capabilities, and Amelia Island Concours-awarded restoration 
make it arguably one of the finest 300 SL Roadsters available today.'

Original condition: The Roadster has since been restored to its original silvery blue

To the highest bidder: The vintage car is set to be auctioned on March 8 in Florida

Natalie Wood was nominated for three Oscars including Best Supporting Actress for her role in Rebel Without a Cause.

But her life was tragically cut short at the age of 43 when she died in mysterious circumstances in 1981.

While on a weekend boat trip with boyfriend Robert Wagner and actor Christopher Walken, Wood drowned.

Her death was declared an accident but the case was reopened in 2012 and re-classified as 'undetermined'.
