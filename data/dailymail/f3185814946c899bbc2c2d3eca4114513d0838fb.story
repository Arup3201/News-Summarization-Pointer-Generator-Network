A drunk driver will have to view the bodies of two people who were killed in car accidents, as part of a sobering sentence.

Judge Mike Cicconetti from Painesville Municipal Court in Ohio handed down the unusual punishment to first time OVI offender Jonathan Tarase, 27, on Tuesday in a bid to keep him, and other drunk drivers, from becoming repeat offenders.

Tarase will have to view the two bodies at a hospital emergency room or the Lake County Coroner's Office immediately following the accidents.

'This could have been an aggravated vehicular homicide,' Cicconetti told WKYC.com.

'It is a scared straight sentence. If we prevent one person because of this, driving under the influence, I've done something.'

Tarase nearly killed a husband and wife after he ran a stop sign in Concord Township on Girdled Road near Orchard. The victims suffered minor injuries but their car was totaled.

He was also sentenced to 65 days in jail, with 60 of the days suspended, probation for six months, a $600 fine and no driving privileges for 15 days.

Cicconetti came up with the strange sentence after Tarase's crash victim told him in court: 'I just don't want this to happen to anybody else again.'

The 27-year-old apologized to the victim.

'It was a very idiotic, moronic thing to do and I am sorry,' he said.

But it wasn't enough.

Cicconetti wanted him to see first hand the real consequences of drinking and driving.

'I want you to have at least two viewings of people who died in car accidents,' he said in court.

Judge Cicconetti has been a Painesville Municipal Court judge since 1994.

He said that he wasn't handing down the odd punishment for the publicity it brings, he was doing it to get through to people.

'The victims said to me, what can you do to get the attention so this guy doesn't do this again? So, this is what I came up with,' Cicconetti said.

'These actions have to stop.'

The judge is known for his interesting sentences.

A convict who called a police officer a pig was sentenced to stand next to a pig and two young people behind a hoax water rescue were sentenced to stand in a baby pool.

'I make them up on the spot,' he told WKYC.com.
