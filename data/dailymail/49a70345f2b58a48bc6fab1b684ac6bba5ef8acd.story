Pizza with Marmite-stuffed crust, bacon and black pudding sandwich, and bangers and mash for breakfast ... this is the perception of British food around the world.

To judge how British cuisine is seen around the world, UK travel and deals provider Travelzoo's teams in the company’s global offices reviewed the menus of so-called ‘British restaurants’ in their region.

There are some very interesting dishes on offer around the world masquerading as British food, from  'shepherd's pie egg roll' in Chicago to 'scotch egg salad' in China.

British cuisine at home and abroad: According to a new report by Travelzoo, there is nothing Britons love more than a Sunday Roast - but the perception of British cuisine abroad is very strange indeed

British-themed restaurants in Sydney and Benidorm put an emphasis on black pudding, but bizarrely place it in a bacon sandwich, and team it with mango chutney, respectively.

An eatery in Hong Kong serves up scotch eggs with avocado salad, but perhaps the most unusual take on British fare comes from Chicago, where one restaurant offers shepherd's pie in egg roll form.

The unusual offerings may please customers abroad looking for a taste - any taste - of home, but on UK soil, culinary preferences are somewhat more traditional.

1. New Zealand: Pizza with a cheesy Marmite-stuffed crust

2. New York, USA: Traditional bangers and mash complete with gravy, for breakfast!

3. Benidorm, Spain: Black pudding with bacon, mushrooms and mango chutney

4. Hong Kong, China: Scotch egg and avocado salad

5. Sydney, Australia: Bacon and black pudding sandwich

The nation's favourite cuisine when dining out is traditional British, according to Travelzoo's report, which celebrates British Food Fortnight.

The Friday night curry comes a close second as Britons' preferred dining choice, followed by Italian and Chinese.

The survey also uncovered regional differences. Surveyed members in Brighton voted Italian their number-one choice, while Scots, Londoners and Mancunians chose Indian over British cuisine.

Taste of Britain? Most people love a pizza, but according to a restaurant in New Zealand, the British version comes with a Marmite-stuffed crust

Heather Rogers, General Manager of Travelzoo’s UK restaurant deal business said, 'British consumers like to think of themselves as adventurous in their dining habits, but we have found there is still a real affection for traditional British food. 

'When you consider the incredible success of programmes such as The Great British Bake Off, as well as the general evolution of the British restaurant scene, it’s not that surprising that as a nation we are proud to support British restaurants.

'Thankfully things have changed dramatically since the days when scampi and chips was the most exotic thing on the menu in UK pubs and restaurants!' 

In addition to selecting British food as their cuisine of choice, over 70% of people said they have a favourite local restaurant they frequent regularly.

In terms of frequency of dining out, 18-24-year-olds are the most avid restaurant-goers, with nearly 30 per cent dining out several times a month, compared to 16 per cent of those aged 45-54.

Interestingly, of all adults polled, 18-24-year-olds are the least enamoured with British food – just 14 per cent chose it as their favourite.  

British Food Fortnight runs from 20th September to 5th October.
