The cold war engulfing Blackpool intensified on Saturday as hundreds of fans demonstrated against club owners, the Oyston family.

Resentment is building among Blackpool followers towards chairman Karl Oyston, who has cut the playing staff to leave manager Jose Riga with just 14 registered players before Saturday’s start to the Championship.

They are yet to sign a goalkeeper and, at one point in the second half of the 1-0 defeat by Burnley, Riga was forced to field eight trialists. Before the defeat by Burnley — in which Marvin Sordell scored the only goal — home fans marched to Bloomfield Road. They wore ‘Oyston Out’ T-shirts and shouted derogatory chants such as ‘you greedy b*****d, get out of our club’.

Blackpool 
legend Jimmy Armfield, who played 626 times for the club and whose 
statue is in front of the stadium, told LBC’s Scores: 'I'm at the wait and see stage but as it is at the moment, there is some concern, there is no question about that.

'They need to get 16 or 17 players together before they go to Nottingham Forest next week.

'We will see what the players are like, I don't know many of them. We will see if they can manage in the Championship because it's a difficult league. They say it is an easy league to get out of. Yes, it is if you drop down but getting up is not easy.

'Looking at this season now, after all the changes, they will be looking for some kind of stability as a success. The easy news story is to hit it now with the recent problems but It's been over the last two seasons and it's been coming. They have had four managers in just over two years. There is no real stability there and that's what matters. The one redeeming factor is that the season lasts nine months and a lot can happen.'

It is understood that relations between Belgian coach Riga and the club's hierachy remain frosty and curiosity was also aroused on Saturday by the sight of Brian Flynn, the former Doncaster Rovers manager, sitting in the stands and taking notes.

Flynn was almost appointed by Oyston in May before a sudden u-turn due to the chairman's unease over the make-up of the Welshman's backroom staff. Sportsmail understands that Flynn was in attendance as a scout for Hull City.
