Police are hunting for a 22-year-old woman who disappeared after leaving a Halloween party last Saturday dressed as Poison Ivy.

Chelsea Ellen Bruck was wearing a black wig and a leaf-covered vest when she was last seen between 3am and 4am in Monroe County, Michigan, as the party was being shut down.

Despite widespread searches on foot and by helicopter, no trace has been found. 

Missing: Police are hunting for Chelsea Ellen Bruck, 22, who was last seen dressed as Poison Ivy on Sunday

Search: This sketch has been issued of the man she was last seen with at the Monroe County party at 4am

The sheriff's office has published a sketch of the man she was seen with in a parking lot outside the gathering in French Township.

The dark-haired man had thin stubble and wore glasses with a black hoodie, witnesses described.

In a missing person appeal, Chelsea Bruck is described as 5'7' tall, 140lbs, blonde, with a small anchor tattoo behind her right ear.

Fears: Her family have said Chelsea's disappearance is 'way out of character' as police struggle to trace her

Distinctive: Missing posters describe an anchor-shaped tattoo behind Chelsea's right ear 

Party: Chelsea had been at the Halloween party (not pictured) with around 15 friends before it closed down

Chelsea's costume, emulating the Batman character Poison Ivy, consisted of black leggings, green ivy leaves and a black wig.

Her sister, Kassandra Bruck, 24, told the Detroit Free Press this morning that the family is encouraging people to share photos of Chelsea - across Michigan and beyond.

'She could be anywhere at this point,' she said. 

The party host Mike Williams, 30, told the paper he had been forced to close the party, intended for 500 people, after around 800 revelers turned up.

He added that he hadn't seen Chelsea at the party at all.  

Distraught: Her sister and mother joined around 100 people in Monroe County on Tuesday for candlelit prayer

Searches: Citizens have gone on daily searches across the entire county in a desperate bid to find Chelsea

More than 100 people joined in candlelit prayer in Monroe County on Tuesday night, her sister said. 

She added that the disappearance was 'way out of character'. 

'A deacon from our church spoke. We joined in prayer together and just kind of met together in prayer and hoping that that prayer has an effect.'

Anyone with information should contact the Sheriff's Office on 734-243-7070.
