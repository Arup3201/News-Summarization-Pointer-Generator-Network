Email exchange: Documents have shown that James Murdoch received a message in 2008 saying hacking at the News of the World was 'rife' but he claims he didn't read it

News International chief James Murdoch was sent details of claims that phone-hacking was ‘rife’ at the News of the World in 2008, explosive new emails have revealed.

Mr Murdoch was contacted by the paper’s then editor Colin Myler which discussed the decision to settle a court case with footballers’ union chief Gordon Taylor.

The exchanges between News of the World executives and lawyers warn that Mr Taylor was determined to ‘demonstrate what happened to him was rife throughout the organisation.’

Mr Myler, who forwarded the email exchanges to Mr Murdoch, added: ‘Unfortunately it is as bad as we feared’.

In the email dated Saturday, June 7, 2008, Mr Myler went on to ask for ‘five minutes’ with him the following Tuesday.

Mr Murdoch replies two minutes later saying: ‘No worries. I am in during the afternoon.  If you want to talk before I’ll be home tonight after seven and most of the day tomorrow.’

Mr Murdoch has repeatedly denied he had any knowledge that phone hacking at the New of the World went beyond one ‘rogue’ reporter.

The News International chief yesterday stuck to these claims saying he was ‘confident’ that he had not read the full email chain.

His denials have been disputed by former executives who say they discussed a crucial email proving that hacking was more widespread at the subsequent meeting on 10 June 2008.

The email - known as the ‘for Neville’ email – implied that the practice went beyond Mr Goodman, who was jailed in 2007 after pleading guilty to phone hacking.

Hasty reply: James Murdoch responded just two minutes after receiving this email from Colin Myler, later claiming that he did not read the full email chain below it

Correspondence: The second page of emails between Julian Pike and Tom Crone talking about the case involving PFA chief Gordon Taylor

Mr Myler and former News International 
legal chief Tom Crone have told MPs the email was the sole reason for 
deciding to pay a settlement of £425,000 to Mr Taylor.

Mr Murdoch insists that the meeting was simply to authorise an increased settlement offer to Mr Taylor and that he was not shown the email or told that it proved that wrong-doing was more widespread than previously thought.

In a letter to MPs on the Culture, Media and Sport select committee, Mr Murdoch yesterday said he could not have read the email exchange in full because of the  ‘timing of my response, just over two minutes after Mr Myler sent his email to me, and the fact that I typically received emails on my Blackberry on weekends.

Murdoch's reply: This is the letter the News International chief sent to the Culture, Media and Sport select committee saying that he did not read the email properly

‘Instead, having agreed to meet the following Tuesday, I would have relied on the oral briefing on 10 June 2008 that I have previously described in my testimony before the committee.

‘I would also like to take this opportunity to reaffirm my past testimony that I was not aware of evidence that either pointed to widespread wrongdoing or indicated that further investigation was necessary.’

Yesterday Mr Crone admitted to the 
Leveson inquiry into Press standards that the paper’s attempts to blame 
the phone hacking scandal on a single ‘rogue reporter’ would ‘come back 
and bite it’.

He accepted 
there was the appearance of ‘a cover-up’ at the paper after former royal
editor Clive Goodman was jailed for phone hacking in January 2007.

Meeting: Colin Myler and Tom Crone say they told Mr Murdoch about the notorious 'For Neville' email which said hacking was not limited to a single reporter during a meeting with him on June 10, 2008. Murdoch denies they did so

Mr Crone, head of legal at News International for 20 years, said he became aware ‘other journalists’ might have hacked phones after Goodman was jailed.

Claims: The email exchange concerned allegations made by PFA head Gordon Taylor, and are thought to be the sole reason he received a £425,000 pay off

He said his view was based on private detective Glenn Mulcaire pleading guilty to hacking five ‘non-Royal victims’, who were not hacked by Goodman. These included supermodel Elle MacPherson, the publicist Max Clifford, footballers union boss Gordon Taylor and Simon Hughes MP.

Robert Jay, QC, counsel for the inquiry, asked if ‘the party line being peddled’ that there was only one rogue reporter ever caused concern.

Mr Crone said: ‘Yes. My feeling is I thought it would probably come back to bite the people who were saying it.’

Asked if he was concerned there was a ‘culture of cover-up’, Mr Crone said ‘to some extent.’

The inquiry also heard from Julian Pike, a partner at the law firm Farrer & Co, which advised News International.

He said he believed the ‘rogue reporter’ defence was untrue and unsustainable after the police disclosed evidence in the Gordon Taylor privacy case brought against News International, in April 2008, in which Mr Taylor was paid more than £700,000 in damages and costs.

He told the inquiry it was ‘self evident’ that News International did not want allegations about its ‘culture of illegal information access’ aired in public.
