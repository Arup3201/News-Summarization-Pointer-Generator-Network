The 16-year-old Connecticut student accused of killing a classmate who turned down his offer to go to prom, told police after the attack: 'I did it,' court documents show.

Christopher Plaskon has been charged with murder as an adult over the death of Maren Sanchez, a friend who was killed last week in a hallway of Jonathan Law High School in Milford.

A witness saw Plaskon on top of 16-year-old Maren during the attack and others saw him discard a bloody knife, according to a police affidavit released on Tuesday.

Victim: Maren Sanchez, pictured with her boyfriend Jarrod Butts, was stabbed to death on Friday morning

Plaskon was dressed in bloody clothes and was being held inside the 
principal's office when an officer arrived and asked
 what happened on Friday.

Held: Plakson, pictured here in his yearbook, is being evaluated at a medical facility

'I did it. Just arrest me,' Plaskon replied, according 
to the officer.

The attack was carried out before the school's junior prom, and police have been investigating whether it was related to Maren's refusal to be Plaskon's prom date.

Plaskon was being held at a medical facility, where his attorneys say he is undergoing psychiatric evaluation.

He was arraigned Tuesday at the medical facility, but he is to be transferred to the custody of the Correction Department, with bond set at $3 million. He faces arraignment in adult court Friday.

Plaskon's family said on Tuesday they 
join the community in mourning the loss of life as the town struggles to
 understand what led to the crime.

'Words
 can only fall short in conveying the depth and breadth of the raw 
sadness we are left with by this unimaginable tragedy,' the family 
said.Â 

'We join with the 
entire Milford community to celebrate the life and mourn the loss of 
this most vibrant and exceptional young woman.'

His family thanked relatives, friends and neighbors for reaching out to them in what they called their darkest hour.

'We
 pray for the wisdom to guide us as we desperately try to pull together 
the shattered pieces of our families,' the family said.

Attorney Richard Meehan said Plaskon was being held for medical evaluation, which can last for up to 15 days.

He said doctors typically order such involuntary commitments in cases where someone in custody is considered a danger to himself.

Mr Meehan added that the teenager's family were reeling from the attack. 'His family is devastated not only for him, but the youngster who was killed. It's a terrible situation all the way around,' he said.

Mark Robinson, a technical education teacher, said he was walking into the high school on Friday when he saw Plaskon being taken out in handcuffs.

He said Plaskon, the third of five brothers, was on football teams that he coached when the teenager had been a freshman and sophomore.

He said Plaskon has a good sense of humor and the family has deep roots in the community. 'There's no reason to suspect he would have done this. I think that's what makes it harder,' Mr Robinson said.

Imani Langston, a student who saw Plaskon being read his rights and taken away in a police car, added that he was known as a class clown and had never been violent.

She said Maren and the boy were just friends and had never dated.

Maren had been excited about prom and had put pictures online of her posing in the dress she planned to wear to it.

The dance has been postponed indefinitely and, instead of going to the dance, the students gathered for a memorial for Maren.
