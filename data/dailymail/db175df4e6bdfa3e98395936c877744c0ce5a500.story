Proud new parents: DailyMail has learned Sara Gilbert welcomed a son with wife Linda Perry on Saturday. The 40-year-old The Talk host and the 49-year-old rocker named their child Rhodes Emilio Gilbert Perry, according to a rep; here they are pictured on February 21 in LA

First look: Sharon Osbourne shared a photo of Rhodes on The Talk on Monday and said, 'I know, divine!'

The name Rhodes derives from the Old English 'rod,' meaning 'a clearing in the woods.'

One of the most famous Rhodes is Cecil J. Rhodes, who established The Rhodes Scholarships,  the oldest and most celebrated international fellowship awards in the world.

Shortly after the announcement Sara's Talk co-star Julie Chen said, 'Our very own Sara and her wife Linda Perry are the proud parents of a new baby boy. Rhodes Emilio Gilbert Perry was born on Saturday and both mother and child are doing well.'

Sharon Osbourne shared the first baby photo on The Talk Monday. 'I know, divine!' the 62-year-old said as she held up a color photo of Rhodes in a hat and blankie while on what appears to be her mother's chest.
