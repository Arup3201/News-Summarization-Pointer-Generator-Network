Hundreds of Afghans torched cars, threw stones at a U.S. military base and shouted 'Death to America in a violent protest in Kabul today against a film mocking the Prophet Mohammed.

The demonstration erupted on Jalalabad Road, home to NATO and U.S. bases in the eastern part of the Afghan capital, with two police cars among those set ablaze.

It is the latest in a string of demonstrations around the world that started last Tuesday when the U.S. ambassador to Libya was killed as protesters stormed the consulate in Benghazi.

The riot also comes after eight Afghan women and girls were killed by a Nato airstrike yesterday while gathering firewood in a remote part of the country.

A low-budget trailer for a movie entitled 'Innocence of Muslims,' believed to have been produced by a small group of extremist Christians in the United States, has sparked furious anti-American protests across the Islamic world.

In Kabul, gunmen from the crowd, which numbered around 1,000, opened fire at police, but officers were told not to return fire to avoid escalating the violence, said Kabul police chief Mohammad Ayoub Salangi.

Between 40 to 50 policemen were 'very slightly wounded' by stone throwers and members of the crowd waving sticks, said Salangi, who added that he had also been grazed by a stone.

An AFP photographer said burning tyres sent thick black smoke streaming into the sky and large stones littered the road as shopkeepers hurriedly locked up and ran away.

There was a heavy police presence and firefighters were quickly scrambled to try to extinguish the flames engulfing cars and storage containers owned by private businesses.

A local district police official, who gave his name only as Hafiz, said protesters threw stones at Camp Phoenix, a U.S-run military base in the area.

'Police drove them back from areas round the base,' he said. The crowd had moved instead to the nearby Hodkhail bazaar, a few blocks from the base.

Lieutenant Colonel Hagen Masser, a spokesman for the US-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said Camp Phoenix had not come under attack.

'We heard that the demonstration could turn into something more violent. But it's only in the vicinity of Camp Phoenix, so it's not an attack,' he said.

'We're monitoring the situation and we are ready. But it's the task of the police.'

The Anti-Islam video has sparked 
demonstrations throughout the Muslim world and the Afghan government 
blocked the YouTube site that hosts the video and its parent company, 
Google Inc., over the weekend in a move to prevent violent protests.

The
riot in Kabul comes a day after four American soldiers were killed by 
rogue Afghan police after coming to their aid at a checkpoint - the 
third assault by government forces or insurgents disguised in military 
uniforms in as many days.

The escalating violence - including a 
Nato airstrike that killed eight Afghan women and girls gathering 
firewood Laghman province, east of the capital - is straining the military partnership between Kabul and Nato 
as the U.S. begins to withdraw thousands of troops sent three years ago 
to route the Taliban from southern strongholds.

The
U.S.-led International Security Assistance Force acknowledged that 
civilians had been killed and expressed its regret over the airstrike. 
It insisted known insurgents had been the target.

'ISAF takes full responsibility for this tragedy,' a statement said.

Villagers from Laghman's Alingar district drove the bodies, covered in white blankets, to the provincial capital, Mehterlam.

Seven injured females were also 
brought to area hospitals for treatment, some of them as young as 10 
years old, said provincial health director Latif Qayumi.

Nato
forces spokesman Capt. Dan Einert said that the strike killed as many 
as 45 insurgents, but may have also killed five to eight Afghan 
civilians.

'Protecting 
Afghan lives is the cornerstone of our mission and it saddens us when we
learn that our action might have unintentionally harmed civilians,' 
said Graybeal said.

Afghan 
president Hamid Karzai 'strongly condemns the airstrike by Nato forces 
which resulted in the deaths of eight women,' a statement from his 
office said. It said the Afghan government was also investigating.

ISAF said coalition officials said they will soon meet with the family members of the victims.

A weekend of deadly attacks began on 
Friday night when 15 insurgents disguised in U.S. army uniforms killed 
two Marines, wounded nine other people and destroyed six Harrier fighter
jets at Camp Bastion in Helmand province, military officials said.

The Taliban claimed that Friday's assault on Camp Bastion was revenge for the video insulting the prophet.

On
Saturday, a gunman in the uniform of a government-backed militia force 
shot dead two British soldiers in Helmand province in the southwest.

The
attacks drew unusually strong criticism today from the U.S. military's 
top officer, Army General Martin Dempsey, who called the problem of 
rogue Afghan soldiers and police turning their guns on allied troops 'a 
very serious threat' to the war effort.

This
year, 51 international service members have died at the hands of their 
Afghan allies or those who have infiltrated their ranks. At least 12 
such attacks came in August alone, leaving 15 dead.

Meanwhile, Indonesians angered over the anti-Islam film are protesting in more cities, but no violence has been reported.

Demonstrations were held today in the cities of Medan and Bandung and were scheduled for the capital, Jakarta.

Over
the weekend in the central Java town of Solo, protesters stormed KFC 
and McDonald's restaurants, forcing customers to leave and management to
close the stores.

The U.S.
Embassy issued an emergency message to American citizens Monday, saying
about 1,000 people were expected to march to the mission with about 
1,500 police on hand.

The 
film has sparked violent protests in many countries in recent days, 
including one in Libya in which the US ambassador was killed.

Other demonstrations have been held in Pakistan, Tunisia, Great Britain and Australia.

In
a move that could escalate tensions around the Arab world, the leader 
of the Hezbollah militant group called for protests against the movie, 
saying protesters should not only 'express our anger' at U.S. embassies 
but urge leaders to act.

The U.S. has responded by deploying additional military forces to increase security in some hotspots.

The wave of international violence began Tuesday when mainly Islamist protesters climbed the U.S. Embassy walls in the Egyptian capital of Cairo and tore down the American flag from a pole in the courtyard.

Chris Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya, was killed that day along with three other Americans, as violent protesters stormed the consulate in Benghazi.

The protests peaked on Friday and abated over the weekend. Around 350 people chanted slogans at a rally outside the U.S. embassy in London on Sunday.

A small group of protesters burned a U.S. flag outside the embassy in the Turkish capital, and in Pakistan there were protests in more than a dozen cities.

In Karachi, rioters broke 
through a barricade near the U.S. consulate, sparking clashes
with police in which one demonstrator was killed and more than a dozen 
injured.

In Lebanon, where one protester was killed in violence on Friday, Pope Benedict urged Arab leaders to work for peace.

'In a world where violence constantly leaves behind its grim trail of death and destruction, to serve justice and peace is urgently necessary,' Benedict said at a mass on Beirut's Mediterranean seafront attended by 350,000 worshippers and leaders of Lebanon's Christian and Muslim communities.
