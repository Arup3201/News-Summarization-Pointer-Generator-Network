In court: Laura Bowery-Falcon allegedly attacked her nanny

A Hamptons mother is accused of beating up a nanny who tried to stop her drunk-driving with her child in the car.

Laura Bowery-Falco, 44, an equestrian trainer, allegedly attacked the family nanny after a dispute on the afternoon of July 11, when the victim was carrying her 14-month-old child.

Bowery-Falco, from Long Island, appeared at Southampton town court Wednesday accused of aggravated DWI, endangering the welfare of a child and harassment.

Authorities say the 20-year-old nanny 
believed Bowery-Falco was intoxicated and did not want her to take her 
14-month-old child in a car. 

Court documents claim that she Bowery-Falco 
got into a 'physical dispute' reported NBC New York.

The nanny was allegedly pulled by her hair and dragged to the ground in the fracas.

She was not seriously hurt in the incident.

Bowery-Falco then left with the child to drive down the street to her mother's home, according to authorities.

According to Newsli,
police officers observed her getting out of her vehicle, and, after her
allegedly suspicious behavior, discovered that she was under the 
influence of alcohol and placed her under arrest, according to reports.
