Gifted: University of Pennsylvania sophomore Elvis Hatcher, 18, died Tuesday after hanging himself

The University of Pennsylvania community is reeling from the suicide of an 18-year-old sophomore, which came just three weeks after another student at the Ivy League college ended her life.

Elvis Hatcher, a native of Miami Beach, Florida, hanged himself Tuesday, according to police.

The teen was rushed to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, where he was pronounced dead.

A popular figure on campus, Hatcher was the treasurer of Pi Lambda Phi Fraternity and worked in IT support at the Wharton School.

Hatcher obtained an associate’s degree in mathematics from Miami Dade College, graduating in 2012 with a 4.0 GPA, before enrolling in University of Pennsylvania.

During his freshman year, Hatcher made the Dean's List and was a National Merit Scholarship finalist. He was expected to complete his studies in 2016. 

The bespectacled, eccentric 18-year-old had not declared a major, instead preferring to take a variety of courses, including calculus, French, art history, printmaking and sex and human nature.

Fascinating character: Those who knew Elvis described him as a bright and funny young man who had many interests, including math, art, music and fashion

Prestigious: Hatcher enrolled in the Ivy League university last year, pursuing a bachelor's degree, after graduating with an associate's degree in mathematics from Miami Dade College

Hatcher's French professor Sophie Degat-Willis called the charming teen one of her 'brightest and funniest students,' The Daily Pennsylvanian reported.

'He was ... a brilliant person, and it's terrible that he passed away,' Hatcher's former neighbor Minji Kwak told the paper.

On Wednesday, Hatcher’s brothers at Pi Lambda Phi released a statement about the passing of the fraternity treasurer.

‘We are deeply saddened by this unfortunate incident and are currently supporting the family during their loss,’ it read. ‘Pi Lambda Phi has been truly blessed to have a brother like Elvis, and will miss him very much.’

Hatcher's sudden passing is the fourth student death at UPenn since the beginning of winter.

On January 17, freshman Madison Holleran, 19, took her own life by jumping from a parking garage in Philadelphia.

Holleran’s father said Madison, a track and field star, had been struggling with her school workload. Her parents suggested that she transfer to a different school or go on a hiatus, but the freshman decided to return to UPenn after the Christmas break.

Between December and mid-January, the Ivy League institution suffered two other losses.

Kevin Zhao, a 21-year-old senior in the School of Engineering and Applied Science, died from cardiac arrest while on a family trip to China.

A few weeks later, computer science major Pulkit 'Josh' Singh, 20, was found dead in his room off campus. The student's cause of death is still pending.

On Wednesday, Hatcher's friends and classmates took to Twitter to pay tribute to the beloved young man.

One user wrote of Hatcher: 'You had an awesome style, a great spirit and wonderful smile. Wish I could have gotten to know you better.'

The band Norwegian Arms, which featured Hatcher in a music video last July showing the teen wiggling around and dancing, posted a touching tribute in his honor on their Tumblr account Wednesday.

One of the band members recalled meeting Elvis for the first time during a concert in 2012.

‘Effortlessly cool, it was instantly apparent that this was a special person,’ the eulogy read. ‘His dance moves were otherwordly, a combination of voguing and interpretive dance so incredible that we ended up approaching him that night and asking him if he’d like to be involved in our first music video.’

'Rest Assured - he'll be missed,' the post concluded.
