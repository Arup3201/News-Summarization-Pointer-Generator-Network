A mother who said she could barely walk claimed nearly £46,000 in benefits before being filmed training for a half marathon.

Gillian Hulme, 55, was a member of a running club in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, where she lived and regularly went to Willfield Fitness Centre five days a week for spinning and aerobics classes.

She was filmed taking part in a five-mile run despite claims that she could not walk more than 20 yards without 'severe discomfort'.

Tipped off by a member of the public,
investigators from the Department for Work and Pensions then discovered
that she had claimed £45,925 in disability benefits.

Tipped off by a member of the public, investigators from the Department for Work and Pensions then discovered that Hulme had claimed £45,925 in disability benefits

Hulme had a legitimate claim in May 1996 for back pain, Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard. But she failed to notify authorities of a change in circumstances between 2009 and 2010.

Judge Mark Eades told Hulme that her life and reputation had been 'publicly ruined' by her actions.

Hulme (pictured arriving at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court) was sentenced to 200 hours community service

He said: 'If you asked most people in 
the street for their opinions on this case, they would probably say lock
you up and throw away the key, but there are guidelines the court has 
to follow.

'You were mobile, in a sports club and
taking physical exercise on a regular basis, and you knew perfectly 
well that what you were doing was utterly wrong.'

He added: 'Disability Living Allowance is for those who require help from the state.

'It's for those who suffer misfortune,
usually of a health nature, and it's a safety net provided by the state
to ensure people who do suffer misfortune do not suffer deprivation in 
consequence.

'The whole system is undermined and 
its reputation damaged by people who dig into that fund of money when 
they are not entitled to it.'

Hulme was a member of the women-only Potters Trotters Running Club and had attended more than 50 events since joining.

She had claimed she was sometimes housebound because of her pains.

Prosecutor Balvinder Bhatti said: 'When the claim started, the defendant said it could take her up to three minutes to walk 20 yards and she was in pain when she stood up.

'Evidence has since been collected that shows her condition has improved significantly and that she joined a running club.

'She also signed up for Willfield Fitness Centre and signed a certificate declaring herself as medically fit.'

Stuart Muldoon, defending, said: 'She [Hulme] is deeply ashamed and has voluntarily been paying back £50 per month since March, despite the threat of custody hanging over her.'

Hulme told investigators that she had joined Potters' Trotters to see if she would be physically able to take part in the exercise.

She later told officers she had been naive and stupid.

Stuart Muldoon, defending, said: 'The money was not being claimed to fund an extravagant lifestyle.

'She is deeply ashamed and has voluntarily been paying back £50 per month since March, despite the threat of custody hanging over her.'

Hulme was ordered to complete 200 hours of community service.
