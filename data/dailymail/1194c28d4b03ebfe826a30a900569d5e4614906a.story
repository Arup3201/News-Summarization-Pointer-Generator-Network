At least 40 people were killed
and 70 injured in north-central Peru after a bus swerved into
another bus in the oncoming lane in a multiple-vehicle accident.

A third bus and a refrigerator truck slammed into the buses
soon after,  sending debris and bus seats scattered over the highway, emergency coordinator Oscar Gonzalez said.

'Preliminary investigations indicate the driver that crossed
into the opposite lane likely fell asleep,' Gonzalez said.

At least 40 people were killed and 70 were injured in Peru after three buses and a refrigerator truck collided on a highway at 4.30am

The crashes are believed to have started when a driver fell asleep and ran into another oncoming bus. A third bus and a refrigerator truck then collided with the crash

The 4.30am crash took place on kilometer 315 of the
Panamerican Norte highway near the coastal town of Huarmey,
authorities said.

A group of Senegalese people and Christian evangelical missionaries were involved in the crash, local media
reported.

Only one doctor and two nurses were at the small town's hospital when the tragedy struck, according to Univision.

Huermay has less than 20,000 people and is known for its beaches.

Relatives at a bus station in Lima waiting for their loved ones desperately called passengers' phones, but many only reached their voicemail answering machines.

Those waiting complained that they had received no information from officials, according to El Mundo.

The inter-province bus lines Challenge, Erick el Rojo y Murga Serrano were involved in the crash.

Deadly bus accidents are common in Peru, where
transportation regulations are weak.

Monday's crash is the worst since October 2013, when 51 people died after a bus fell into a ravine near Cusco.
