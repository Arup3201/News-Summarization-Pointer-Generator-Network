Millions of workers in councils, schools and hospitals would be asked what their parents did for a living if Labour wins the next election.

Equalities spokesman Gloria De Piero said too many careers were dominated by middle class and private school-educated people.

She said that, starting with the public sector, the first step to increase social mobility would be to force employers to keep records on the social backgrounds of their staff to prove they were not all from privileged sections of society.

This would involve asking questions about their parents' occupations to assess whether they were working class.

But critics immediately dismissed the plan as an expensive, bureaucratic gimmick.

Miss De Piero, 41, grew up in a working-class area of Bradford. She became MP for Ashfield in Nottinghamshire in 2010 after a career as a GMTV presenter, and within three and a half years was shadow minister for women and equalities.

Addressing Labour's annual conference, she said: 'We talk a lot about smashing glass ceilings, and rightly so. But the Labour Party will never forget about the people who can't even get through the door of the building.

'Because if you're born poor, you are more likely to stay poor in this country than in other wealthy nations.

'There are ladders that can be used to climb up and get on but they aren't being extended to everyone. Good companies already monitor the race, gender and disability of their staff. They should monitor social background for the same reason. A Labour government will work to ensure this is done in the public sector.'

She said this had been implemented for the first time by the civil service's 'fast stream', which parachutes graduates into top jobs in Whitehall.

When it surveyed its intake, just 25 out of 654 graduates were working-class, she said. 'It makes me angry,' she told delegates. 'Talent is class-blind, but Britain is still not. The civil service should set the standard on open recruitment and open opportunity.'

Staff would not be questioned about their background when they were applying for a job. Instead, employees would be asked voluntary questions about their parents' occupations.

A rising Labour star has advised his colleagues to stop talking in 'political soundbites' if they want to win votes.

Shadow justice minister Dan Jarvis, a former Army officer, also insisted his party must go 'toe-to-toe' with Ukip, having taken too many supporters in Labour's northern heartlands for granted. 'The public are so fed up, so cynical with politicians – we have got a huge challenge to address that,' he told the Guardian.

'We have got to convince people we are on their side ... I know the public just stop listening when we speak in a language of the Westminster village that is about a clipped political soundbite.'

Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, who grew up in a working-class home and became a millionaire, said the plan was a gimmick designed to 'appease the lentil-munching Guardianistas in the Labour Party'. He added: 'It would create more costly bureaucracy for public bodies, and would quickly be extended to businesses where it would harm services and job creation. People should be encouraged to aspire to fulfil their potential through hard work, talent and opportunity.' Monitoring employees' backgrounds was a key recommendation in a report by Alan Milburn, the former Labour minister who advises the Coalition on social mobility.

Parts of the civil service monitor levels of working-class staff using an Office for National Statistics definition that identifies their parents as having routine jobs in the sales, service, production, technical and agricultural sectors. City law firms have monitored the backgrounds of staff since 2011 after they were found to be among the least socially-diverse employers.

A spokesman for Miss De Piero said: 'The public sector already asks about the ethnicity, gender and disability status of employees. Social background would just be another question. It will help expose which parts of society still operate as a closed shop.'

Ed's £8 minimum wage a 'threat to jobs'

Ed Miliband's plan to raise the minimum wage to please 'Burger King Britain' will cost jobs and squeeze the better off, Labour was warned last night.

Kicking off his party's annual conference yesterday, Mr Miliband unveiled eye-catching proposals to force employers to pay staff at least £8 an hour.

He said he had been inspired to bring in the increase after meeting a low-paid worker at the Burger King fast food chain.

The most junior members of staff there get the current minimum of up to £6.31 an hour, according to job adverts. The rate, which applies to about 1.4million workers, will increase to £6.50 an hour from next month and business leaders warned that is the highest it can be without putting jobs at risk.

Steve Hughes, head of economics at the Policy Exchange think-tank, said: 'Major hikes in the national minimum wage could actually lead to slower pay increases for those slightly up the pay scale, who still struggle on relatively low incomes.'

Mr Miliband's announcement would see the minimum wage raised in annual stages to at least £8 an hour by 2020, adding around £3,000 a year to salaries of those working 40 hours a week. This would save the taxpayer 'hundreds of millions of pounds' in welfare payments, the Labour leader said.

He rejected suggestions that an above-inflation rise in the minimum wage would be unaffordable for the public sector, which is one of the biggest employers of low-paid staff, and would cost jobs. 'What is happening at the moment is that we are spending billions of pounds subsidising employers who are paying low wages, billions of pounds in benefits, tax credits and housing benefit,' Mr Miliband told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show.

John Allan, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: 'Our concern is that setting rates according to political need means that the impact of rises on employment, inflation and growth will not be fully explored. Sectors such as retail and social care are run on very fine margins, and will struggle with substantial increases to the minimum wage rate that fail to take wider economic conditions into account.'

But TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'Raising the minimum wage and putting more money into the hands of low-paid workers won't just be welcomed by hard-pressed families, it will also be good news for local economies who will benefit from a boost in workers' spending power.'
