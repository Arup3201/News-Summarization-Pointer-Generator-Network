Voting has concluded in most of Zimbabwe's polling stations in elections in which Robert Mugabe faced one of the biggest challenges to his 33-year grip on power.

A few polling stations were prepared to stay open into the night to accommodate all voters who were in line by 7pm.

Vote counting is expected to begin tonight and final results are expected by Monday.

Zimbabweans voted in large numbers despite concerns about the credibility of the electoral process, and the vote was relatively peaceful compared to disputed and violent polls in 2008.

Thousands of voters lined up in Harare's
populous Mbare township but by the evening all the voters had been 
accommodated, said polling officials. 'It's a tremendous turnout,' said 
Magodelyo Yeukai, Mbare presiding officer.

Polling officials and party agents 
brought blankets to polling stations so that they could sleep next to 
the polling boxes to make sure they were not tampered with.

Some election observers noted cases 
of registered voters being turned away from the polls. There have been 
worries about oversights in the hasty preparations for the vote, as well
as fears of alleged vote-rigging of the kind that occurred in past 
elections.

Tendai Biti, the third-ranking 
official in the former opposition party of Prime Minister Morgan 
Tsvangirai, Mugabe's popular challenger, reported alleged irregularities
across several districts, including changes to voters' lists and ballot
papers.

But 'we are encouraged by the high turnout. We remain confident in spite of all these challenges,' Mr Biti said.

The head of the African Union 
observer mission, former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo, said 
reports of irregularities 'will be investigated but have not yet been 
substantiated.'

Voters queued from before dawn to 
cast their ballots - despite fears that vote-counting could be rigged in
favour of the 89-year-old tyrant, under whose reign Zimbabwe became one
of Africa's worst-governed countries.

At
a school in Harare, many citizens were dressed in heavy coats, scarves 
and hats to ward off the winter cold as they waited for hours.

'It is moving slowly, but I am here for as long as it takes,' said voter Isaac Rufaro. 'We have got to get this done.'

Mugabe has denied allegations of 
vote-rigging and dismissed concerns about the credibility of the polls, 
but Western governments have complained about the lack of transparency 
in the run-up to the vote.

The
president is facing up against his old rival Morgan Tsvangirai, who has
been prime minister in an uneasy coalition with Mugabe's Zanu-PF since 
the country's last election in 2008, which was marred by violence 
against opposition supporters.

Mugabe
has promised that if he loses he will hand power over to Tsvangirai. 
However, the opposition MDC claims that Mugabe supporters have engaged 
in vote-rigging in a desperate attempt to stay in power.

The official state election body has admitted that administrative, logistical and funding problems have hindered voting arrangements, but says they had been resolved and voting is ready to go ahead at more than 9,000 polling stations across the country.

Voting officials at one suburban Harare 
shopping centre said their line of at least 1,000 people was expected to
move more quickly as staff became more proficient in finding names on 
pages and pages of lists of voters, and verifying identity documents.

Previous elections in 2002 and 2008 were accompanied by allegations of vote rigging and political violence.

Rights
groups say there has been little overt violence this time around, but 
noted deep concerns remain over shambolic voters' lists, the role of 
Mugabe's loyalist police and military in the voting process and bias in 
the state media.Â 

The International Crisis Group said it fears a return to 'a protracted political crisis, and possibly extensive violence' if the Zimbabwe poll is inconclusive and disputed, and especially if election observers fail to identify flaws in the hastily arranged elections.

Mugabe has refused to allow Western observer missions, including one from the Jimmy Carter Center, to monitor voting but Western embassies in Zimbabwe have been permitted to deploy a limited number of diplomats to key voting districts.

Zimbabwe's shaky coalition government was effectively dissolved today.

Both Mugabe and Tsvangirai have 
predicted outright victory for their parties that would avoid the 
formation of another coalition.
