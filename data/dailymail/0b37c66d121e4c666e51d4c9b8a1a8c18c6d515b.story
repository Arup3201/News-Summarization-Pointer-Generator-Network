Completing any marathon is a punishing ordeal.

But throw in the sub-zero temperatures of Siberia - and the possibility of plunging through a sheet of ice into the world's deepest lake - and only the most determined of athletes need apply.

Less than 150 runners took part in the Baikal International Ice Marathon yesterday, which saw competitors donning special, studded shoes in order to pound their way across the frozen surface of Siberia's ancient Lake Baikal.

Tough: The International Lake Baikal Ice Marathon in Siberia sees competitors run across the frozen surface of the world's deepest lake

Sub-zero temperatures: Runners have to wear special studded shoes to make their way across the glassy frozen surface of the lake

Marathon organisers study satellite 
photos of the vast lake - the largest freshwater lake in the world - 
ahead of the annual event to identify possible cracks, and experts only 
plot the final, safest course across the surface immediately before the 
starting gun is fired.

The unique event, now in its ninth year, attracts entrants from around the globe.

The first 10km stretch of yesterday's marathon took runners across the black, mirror-like surface of the lake, then on to a stretch of ice covered in densely packed snow.

Temperatures plunge as low as -12C in the small town of Listvyanka.

Extreme: Alimpiada Cassidy, who is Kent, travelled 4,000 miles to compete in the marathon in Siberia yesterday

Demanding: The air is so clear and the ice surface so flat that runners can make out the distant finish line as soon as they set out

Re-fuelling station: Tables laden with dried fruit and nuts, cheese, water and hot tea were provided for runners at 5km intervals

The Baikal International Ice Marathon
is psychologically as well as physically demanding, as the clear air 
and flat terrain means runners can make out the distant finish line 
almost as soon as they begin - giving them nothing to focus on but how 
far they are from their goal.

'That's really tough', said Jeff Ramsay, 46, an American who lives in Moscow and competed for the second time yesterday.

Local runner Sergei Kalashnikov crossed the finish line first yesterday, clocking up a time of three hours and seven minutes.

Sustenance: Hot tea and water for the marathon runners was kept in insulated containers to stop in freezing

Unique: Runners come from all corners of the globe to take part in the Lake Baikal Ice Marathon in Siberia, like Andrew Heiny, 21, who travelled from New York to take part

Warm up: Russian runner Andrei Stadnik took off his shirt during the marathon despite the icy Siberian temperatures

Welcome refreshments: The best runners complete this marathon at a pace 50 per cent slower than in other races, due to the nature of the surface

Relief: Only 100 people participate in the extreme marathon each year
