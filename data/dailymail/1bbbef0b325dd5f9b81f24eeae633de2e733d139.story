The woman whose secret life as a £300-an-hour call girl made her a fortune is suing her ex-boyfriend for libel - because he claims she was never a prostitute.

Dr Brooke Magnanti, 39, whose diary of her adventures working as a high class escort was published anonymously under the pen name 'Belle de Jour', is reportedly suing on the grounds that the claim damages her reputation.

Her blog told of her life as a struggling graduate in London and working as call girl to fund her studies - and included her former lover Owen Morris, known only as 'The Boy'.

It led to two bestselling books and the successful Secret Diary Of A Call Girl series, starring Billie Piper.

But American-born Dr Magnanti has said she faced a backlash for glamourising prostitution after her identity was revealed.

The books and series also led Mr Morris, a former RAF officer, to file a lawsuit in 2013 challenging Dr Magnanti's version of events. He claimed her stories were based on her sex life with him.

But in what is likely a legal first, Dr Magnanti's legal team had launched a counter-claim at Edinburgh's Court of Sessions, VICE reported.

They are set to argue that claiming she had never worked as a prostitute is defamatory.

Mr Morris, who is known only as ‘The Boy’ in the books, pursued damages for defamation and breach of privacy against Dr Magnanti after the release of her books, who has a PhD in Forensic Science.

Soon after their relationship ended in 2008, he claimed her books - The Intimate Adventures Of A London Call Girl, in 2005, and The Further Adventures Of A London Call Girl, in 2006 - were 'fantasy'. 

Writing on blog Sexonomics at the time, she said: 'I have no choice but to defend this. But am happy to do so even though it will almost certainly mean losing everything I have even when I win.' 

She took to her blog to vehemently deny his allegations, insists her blog and the resulting books are true.

A statement from Dr Magnanti's legal team to Vice said: 'I can confirm a counter-claim has been lodged. 

'I have been advised by my QC to offer no further comment pending the resolution of this litigation.'
