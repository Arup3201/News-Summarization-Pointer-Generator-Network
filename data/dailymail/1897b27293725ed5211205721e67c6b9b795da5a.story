Maria Sharapova is enjoying a post-Wimbledon break with her fellow tennis-playing boyfriend Grigor Dimitrov.

The couple are on holiday break following their exertions in SW19, taking a relaxing break in sunny Mexico.

For Sharapova, it was something of a disappointing tournament. After Serena Williams' shock third round exit she was the hot favourite for victory, but fell to a shock exit in the next round to Angelique Kerber.

She still has her French Open victory from last month to enjoy, however.

For 
Dimitrov, it was finally the breakthrough campaign that everybody had 
expected of him for so long, getting to the semi-finals - including a 
straight sets win over Andy Murray in the last-eight - before eventually
 being beaten by eventual champion Novak Djokovic.

Both will be relishing their break after such a busy time, especially with the buildup to next month's US Open is starting soon.
