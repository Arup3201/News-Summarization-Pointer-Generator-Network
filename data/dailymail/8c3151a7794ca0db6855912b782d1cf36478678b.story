Half of children are not ready for school at the age of five, a report has found.

Only 52 per cent of children in England have reached a ‘good’ level of development when they move from reception to their first year of school, the data shows.

University College London researchers said the figure fell to as low as 28 per cent in some parts of the country. 

The study by University College London found that barely a quarter of five-year-olds in Leicester showed a level of development that meant they were ready to start school, while in Greenwich almost three-quarters were ready by the end of reception.

Professor Sir Michael Marmot said Britain was falling behind in terms of child development, compared to almost every other western country.

He said: ‘How can this still be happening? For three years the Institute of Health Equity has published evidence showing we are failing our children.

‘It is unacceptable that only half of our five-year-olds are achieving a good level of development.’ 

Sir Michael said England was ‘bumping along the bottom’ in the rankings. 

The figures have dropped by 7 percentage points from 2011, when 59 per cent of children had a good level of development by the age five. 

In the best performing area, Greenwich in south-east London, 69 per cent of five-year-olds had reached their expected level of development.

But in Leicester, only 27.7 per cent attained this.

The richer children were, the more ready they were to start school. The study found that children from the wealthiest families (on the right of the graphic) were more than five percentage points more likely to show a good level of development at the end of reception than children from the poorest families (on the left).

Sir Michael said: ‘We are doing really badly. One strategy for reducing these avoidable inequalities in early childhood development is to reduce deprivation and improve living standards for families with children.’

A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘No child should start school behind their peers. This is why our plan for education is providing flexible, affordable and good quality childcare.

‘We are raising the status and quality of the early years workforce by introducing rigorous new qualifications so practitioners are highly skilled and can help all children reach the expected level of development.’
