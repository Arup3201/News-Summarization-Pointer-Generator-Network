Sheryl Sandberg is officially moving out of America's richest zip code, after selling her Atherton, California mansion last month for $9.25million.

The chief operating officer of Facebook listed the  11,430-square-foot estate in September 2013, and it sold a year later after a $1million mark down from the original $10.5million asking price. 

Sandberg and husband David Goldberg, CEO of Survey Monkey, came out the winners nonetheless, making a $1million profit on the home their purchased in 2004 for nearly $8million. 

Moving out: Sheryl Sandberg has sold her Atherton, California mansion for $9.25million - more than a $1million what she purchased the home for in 2004 

Off the market: The Facebook COO and her husband David Goldberg sold their home in America's richest zip code last month, a year after putting it on the market for $10.5million 

Money smart: Sandberg became a public figure last year after the release of her book 'Lean In' a manifesto for professional women looking for success in the workplace (right). On the left, pictured speaking on a panel in new York last month

At the time, the newly-built home was closer to Sandberg's then workplace - Google. 

According to Trulia, the 7-bedroom, 8.5-bath mansion 'is stylishly appointed, with exceptional finishes throughout'. 

The new owners are inheriting a home that has been visited by President Obama and Lady Gaga, who attended a $38,500-plate fundraiser there in 2011. Condoleezza Rice, Gloria Steinem and Michael Bloomberg have also been invited in the past to speak at the Sandberg home.  

The 'Lean In' author, her husband and their two young children have been living in a newly-completed home in nearby Menlo Park for the past year. 

They purchased a Mediterranean-style bungalow there in 2009, tore it town, and replaced it with a $11million 9,200-square-foot modern home with six bedrooms and six bathrooms. 

Two years later, Facebook's headquarters relocated closer to that home, making it a more convenient choice for the Sanberg-Goldberg clan.

Sandberg's new home includes a waterfall, home theater, gym, wine cellar and outdoor basketball court.  

It also has a ' great room' perfect to host her legendary dinner parties for Silicon Valley's elite. 

Like the Facebook headquarters, it has a living roof and solar panels which help make the building a little greener.

New address: Since putting her Atherton house on the marketplace, Sandberg and her family have been living in their newly-completed home in Menlo Park 

Close to work: Sandberg and Goldberg purchased their new Menlo Park home in 2009, and tore down the original bungalow to create a colossal ultra-modern home. Their new home is much closer to Sandberg's job at Facebook
