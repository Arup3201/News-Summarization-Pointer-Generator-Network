Urine, feces and pools vomit everywhere: that's what a family in Buffalo, New York, found all over their house when they returned home from a vacation in Costa Rica last month - and they can thank teenagers from some of the areas most elite schools.

It turns out that the 17-year-old girl the family had hired to watch their cats threw a party at Binder's house and invited teens from all over the Buffalo area to partake in destroying the home the family has spent 20 years fixing up.

When Binder asked the teen's parents to pay for the damages, they offered him $90, which wouldn't even begin to cover the thousands of dollars worth of damage done to the house, the jewelry that was stolen, or the $6,000 in cash that was taken from the house.

When Binder and his family walked in the door, they found the mother of the cat-sitter standing in their foyer next to a vacuum cleaner. She explained that there was a problem with one of the beds and that she had taken the liberty of taking a comforter and two rugs to a professional cleaner.

But Binder - still confused as to why there was thousands of dollars in damage to his home, as well as urine and vomit everywhere - wanted to know what caused all of the damage.

'What the hell happened?' he asked the girl's mother.

What had happened was that the 17-year-old cat-sitter, who the family describes as a 'trusted friend' of their daughter, invited roughly 50 teenagers from many of the area's elite private schools - with names like City Honors School, Nardin Academy, St. Joseph’s Collegiate Institute - and they destroyed the house.

As if the urine feces and vomit wasn't bad enough, Binder tells the Buffalo News that he also found used condoms scattered throughout the house.

As if the damage wasn't bad enough, video of the teens destroying the house started popping up on social media websites.

In one of the videos, a male was seen urinating on 18-year-old Zoey Binder's bed - as another teen is narrating, saying 'this is for you.'

'The destruction to our house is considerable. There was human feces, urine and vomit in numerous locations. Every floor in the house was rifled. There was broken furniture and there were multiple used condoms,” Binder told the paper, as he and his wife explained that it wasn't until last week that the stench from the December 27 party was finally gone.

'It took an industrial strength cleaning to get rid of the odors of urine and vomit, and we keep discovering more,' Binder said. 'I don’t know that I won’t open a box in my attic at some point and discover more vomit. There was vomit everywhere.'

According to Binder, the cats the 17-year-old was supposed to be watching were so traumatized by what went on during the party 'that they did not come out of their hiding places until two days after we had come home.'

Authorities have been given a list of the names of at least 46 people who were at the party as they begin to investigate the role the cat-sitter played in throwing the party.

Authorities say that twenty-five of the teens involved in destroying the house attended City Honors, seven were from 
Nardin Academy, six from Canisius High School, four from St. Joseph’s 
Collegiate Institute - which charges fees of $10,000 a year - three from a Williamsville high school and one was
 an exchange student.

The identity of the 17-year-old cat-sitter has not been made public.

In addition to the video of a teenager urinating on Zoey Binder's bed, authorities found other social media entries they believe are in reference to the party:

'If I didn’t die last night, I’m probably living forever.'

'I am DISGUSTED by every aspect of this night.'

'Never realized that I go to school with such horny people.'

'Roll another bowl.'

Binder says he and his wife met with the parents of the cat-sitter. He says they asked them to reimburse the $8,500 they spent on their vacation as partial restitution for the damage done to their home. The girls' parents, however, gave them a check for $90 - the amount they'd paid the girl to watch their cats.

If no criminal charges are filed, Binder will likely sue the parents of the cat-sitter in civil court.
