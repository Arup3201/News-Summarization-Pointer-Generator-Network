North and South Korea have been at war - and an uneasy truce - for decades.

Now, Mark Edward Harris, an award-winning photojournalist with rare access into the secretive Northern state, is marking the 60th anniversary of the armistice which put a halt to the Korean war with a new collection of pictures from the democratic South.

Harris has visited North and South Korea about eight times apiece to document life on the divided peninsula.

He first travelled to North Korea in 2005 and published a book of photographs from his visits in 2007.

Now, his new book of pictures from South Korea show life beyond Seoul and the Demilitarized Zone on the border of the two countries which captures so much international attention.

Harris told Korea.net: 'I am not trying to make any judgment.

Mark Edward Harris has travelled beyond Seoul and Pyongyang to capture the real North and South Koreas on film. Here, he photographed two small girls in matching pink coats unfazed by the sharks overhead as they walk through the enormous 6,030-ton tank in the Aqua Planet Yeosu aquarium - the biggest in South Korea

Another picture in the South Korea collection shows the right hand of the Hand of Harmony sculptures in the water off Homigot beach. The left hand stands on dry land on the seafront - the eastern-most point in the country. The sculptures, which were installed in 1999, are made of bronze and granite and are said to be at their best at sunrise

'South Korea is so successful; it is completely a different world,' he said.

'Years go by, there is the whole new 
generation of people since the separation, and they only know it as two 
separate countries. It is an interesting time to be here.'

He told My Modern Metropolis: 'I have
 seen vast changes since I first stepped onto the tarmac at Pyongyang's 
Sunan International Airport in 2005. Thousands of cars now traverse the 
once empty streets of the capital city.

'There are an Italian pizza parlor, 
an Austrian coffee house, and a British-style pub in Pyongyang. 
Traveling to other regions of the country away from the showcase city, I
 am seeing historic changes that cannot be passed off as propaganda 
created for foreign eyes.'

Harris's long-held interest in history stems from his university studies and he holds a master's degree in the subject.

His photographs have featured in The Times, the New York Times and the LA Times, as well as Vogue, Elle, Life and Harper's Bazaar.
