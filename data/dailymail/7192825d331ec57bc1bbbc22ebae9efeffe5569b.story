Disabled pensioner Alan Barnes has called for his attacker to be sent to jail when he is sentenced this week.

Richard Gatiss knocked visually impaired, 4ft 6in Mr Barnes to the ground outside his home in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear in a cowardly attack which shocked Britain earlier this year.

Drug addict Gatiss will find out his punishment when he comes before a judge at Newcastle Crown Court on Thursday after he pleaded guilty to assault with intent to rob.

Alan Barnes, who was bundled over outside his home in January, has called for his attacker to be jailed

Mr Barnes today called for Gatiss, who has been kept behind bars for his own safety, to feel the full weight of the law.

He told ITV's This Morning: 'He needs to go to prison, because otherwise he might just do it to someone else. Somebody else might get something worse done to them than what happened to me.'

The frail 67-year-old, who was born with growth problems after his mother contracted German measles while pregnant, said he didn't believe Gatiss's belated apologies.

He said: 'It doesn't [make a difference] because it's easy for somebody to say that but still do it to somebody else afterwards, so I'd like the law to take its course.'

More than £330,000 was raised to help Mr Barnes after the details of what happened to him travelled around the world.

Today, sitting with local beautician Katie Cutler who organised the fund-raising campaign, he said he would be buying a new house.

Mr Barnes said: 'Half of its going on the house and I'll use the rest for living on. It'll keep us going.'

Telling of his joy at moving out of the area in which he was attacked, he added: 'As soon as I got to my feet, it was just plastered in my mind that I can't live here any more.'

At a hearing earlier this month, Judge Paul Sloan QC told Gatiss he would continue to be remanded in custody and 'an immediate sentence of imprisonment is pretty well inevitable'.

It has previously been said in court that Gatiss was trying to get money to buy legal highs when he tried to mug Mr Barnes.

Mr Barnes was shoved over and broke his collar bone but Gatiss fled empty-handed when his victim called for help.
