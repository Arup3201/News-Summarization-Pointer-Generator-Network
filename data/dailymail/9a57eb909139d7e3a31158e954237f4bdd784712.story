He showed up and played 18 holes, but there the good news endeth concerning Tiger Woods.

If only there was an instant cure for his game to go with the one for his latest back problem. Instead, there was just more evidence of his alarming decline, vividly illustrated by the coarse shriek at his 11th hole as another drive sailed off line.

‘For ****’s sake, Tiger!’ he raged. It got worse — the golf that is, not the swearing. The swearing is always bad.

He hit a drive so far right on his 16th hole it was still rising when it cleared the gallery. It was so far off line it would have taken Usain Bolt seven or eight seconds to reach it from the middle of the fairway.

‘Is that OB?’ he asked playing partner Phil Mickelson, as in Out of Bounds.

Woods ended with a 74 to be comfortably outside the top 100. There are times when he tries kidology and says things are progressing when plainly they are not. This was so bad he didn’t even try to pretend.

‘It wasn’t very good at all,’ he said. ‘I hit a lot of bad shots and couldn’t get my putts to the hole and that’s not a good combo.’

In the past he would have headed to the range to sort things out but that wasn’t possible. ‘I’m going to get treatment and make sure this thing is nice and loose tomorrow,’ he said. Actually, in the past, if Woods was this out of shape, he wouldn’t have showed up at all. Which begs the question: why is he here?

‘If I get under par for two rounds, that will be right in the ball game,’ he said. Woods will not qualify for the four-tournament FedEx Cup series that follows and so has no more golf scheduled this side of the Ryder Cup. Not exactly a convincing argument for a wild card, is it?

Woods was part of a three ball featuring Mickelson and Padraig Harrington; three men with no fewer than 22 major championships between them.

A decade or so ago you’d have bet the mortgage that you were watching the eventual winner.

Here, there was no evidence of that, even though Mickelson, by virtue of his prowess around the greens, somehow delivered a two-under 69. Harrington laboured to a 73.

When it was over, Mickelson went to the media interview area and was asked about Woods (left).

He smiled and thought for a second about what he could say. ‘I thought he showed a lot of heart,’ he remarked, eventually. That was about the sum of it.
