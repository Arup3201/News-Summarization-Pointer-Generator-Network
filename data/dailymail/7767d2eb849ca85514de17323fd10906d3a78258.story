Two Texas twins were arrested after forcing their 75-year-old ‘very hurt’ grandmother to panhandle at a local Walmart.

Margaret Campbell had been eating pizza on Sunday with 19-year-old twins, Joshua and James Cerda, and their 18-year-old friend, Ashley Ramey.

Campbell says her grandsons then drove to the Walmart in Porter, Texas, to hustle for money to pay their gas.

Twins arrested: Joshua and James Cerda, 19, are in jail for 'forcing' their grandmother, Margaret Campbell, to beg for money at a local supermarket in Porter, Texas

Exploited grandmother: Margaret Campbell, 75, said she was 'very, very hurt' by her grandsons' actions on Sunday

She says she tried to refuse, but that one of the twins, Joshua, was especially determined.

‘[He said] “Granny, you’ve got to get us some money. I have no gas”,’ Campbell told KHOU 11 News. 

She says she told them to ‘learn to go to work and save your money and quit taking it and blowing it for foolishness’.

When they arrived at the Walmart at Highway 59, Campbell was allegedly kicked out of the car and told to start asking shoppers for cash.

Accomplice: The twins' friend, 18-year-old Ashley Ramey, was also arrested for taking part in the incident

She says she had collected less than $10 dollars before being approached by the Montgomery County Deputy Constable, who had been flagged down by a customer outside the store.

‘This tall officer came up to me and he says, “What’s wrong?” I said, “I am very, very upset”,’ says Campbell.

The three teens were inside the car in the parking lot when they were approached by the deputy.

They were arrested on felony charges of exploitation of the elderly and are being held at the Montgomery County Jail on a $3,000 bond.

Campbell, who lives with her grandsons in Liberty County and has helped raise them since they were infants, says they are not welcome back home.

She claims this is not the first time her grandsons have bullied her into panhandling.
