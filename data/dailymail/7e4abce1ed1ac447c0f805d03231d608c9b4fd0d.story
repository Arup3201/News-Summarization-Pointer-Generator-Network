Lionel Messi's hunger at Barcelona was questioned during the first half of the season, but the Argentina superstar showed an appetite of a different kind is still intact on Sunday.

Fresh from scoring a hat-trick in their 6-1 La Liga victory over Rayo Vallecano earlier in the day, the 27-year-old was spotted in London at the Colony Club Casino Bar.

Messi visited the Mayfair exclusive hotspot with girlfriend Antonella Roccuzzo as they enjoyed a double date with Chelsea star Cesc Fabregas and his partner Daniella Semaan.

The happy couples have been close for years following Fabregas' return to Barcelona from Arsenal in 2011.

Fabregas subsequently moved to Chelsea last summer but the quartet's friendship evidently remains as Messi and Roccuzzo flew from Spain to spend time with the Spain international and Semaan.

But any chance of Messi and Fabregas' rekindling their on-the-pitch partnership seem remote for now following comments from Barcelona's international sporting director Ariedo Braida.

Speaking to Catalan TV channel Esport 3, Braida says the club will do everything they can to keep Messi at the Nou Camp but accept they may not be able to match a potential offer from a bigger-spending club.

Messi who is Barca's all-time top scorer, is tied to the Catalan giants until June 2019 and has a £205 million release clause in his contract.

When asked about the dimunitive No 10's future, Braida said: I believe it's very difficult that Messi will leave Barca but at times in football strange things happen.

'Now with these clubs that have so much money like (Manchester) City, certain amounts don't seem to have a value.

'In football things happen that appear impossible but I hope he will remain.'

Messi claimed earlier this year that he was happy at Barca and quashed speculation that he would leave the club this summer.

The Argentina international created a new hat-trick record in Spain by scoring three goals in Barca's triumph over Rayo - his 24th league treble for Barca in all competitions.

The outcome at the Nou Camp lifted Luis Enrique's team to the top of Primera Division, just one point clear of Real Madrid, who lost 1-0 at Athletic Bilbao on Saturday.

Messi has enjoyed an outstanding campaign, scoring 30 goals and setting up 14 more in 26 league appearances.

'He is not just a player,' Braida added. 'Messi is a phenomenon, he is an alien.'
