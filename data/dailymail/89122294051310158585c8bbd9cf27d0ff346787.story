Battle with drugs: Philip Seymour Hoffman was often seen around the West Village in Manhattan before his death and he is pictured here in October of last year - five months after he sought treatment for his relapse into heroin addiction

It was the last message Philip Seymour Hoffman ever sent - an 8.58pm text on Saturday to his good friend David Katz asking if he just wanted to come over and catch the Knicks game on television.

Katz missed it, then his own 11.30pm text back to the Oscar winner went unanswered.

The next morning, Katz discovered his friend slumped on the floor of his bathroom - dead from an apparent heroin overdose at 46-years-old.

The penultimate message Hoffman sent at 8.44pm read, 'you wanna watch the second half of the knick heat game at Bethune,' revealed Katz to the New York Times.

At 8.58pm, Hoffman, keen for company, wrote another message, 'like 10:15.'

Katz was at a restaurant and did not text back at the time. At 11.30pm he sent, 'just got out of dinner. Where r u?' to Hoffman. The actor did not write back.

Piecing his final days together, it becomes clear that Hoffman's spiral into the throes of addiction was rapid and distressing for his family and even strangers who mistook the multi-millionaire for a homeless person.

Indeed, Hoffman's last days were 
ominously preceded by his bare confession that he was 'a heroin addict' at the Sundance Film Festival 
to a magazine publisher he did not know.

Returning
 to New York City after promoting his films God’s Pocket and A Most 
Wanted Man at the January 19 meeting, Hoffman settled back into a rented
 $10,000 a month apartment on Bethune Street.

Friends: Philip Seymour Hoffman sent a text message to his friend David Bar Katz (center) asking him to come around to his house and watch basketball the night before he died - Katz failed to respond to the message in time and found Hoffman the next day dead on his bathroom floor

Tragic: The body of Philip Seymour Hoffman was removed from his apartment after being discovered by his friend David Bar Katz and his personal assistant Isabella Wing-Davey at 11am on Sunday morning

He had moved into the two bedroom home two months before - after his partner of 14-years Mimi O'Donnell asked him to leave the home they shared with children, Cooper, 10, Tallulah, 7, and Willa, 5, because of his relapse into heroin addiction.

Clean for 23 years, Hoffman had fallen off the wagon earlier in 2013 and checked himself into rehab in May.

However, he clearly was struggling to stay sober and so set up himself up only two blocks away from his children and girlfriend - seeing them as often as he could.

A member of the Narcotics Anonymous group in the West Village that Hoffman attended, said that in December, the actor laid bare his struggles with sobriety.

Drinking binge: Philip Seymour Hoffman was seen at an 
Atlanta bar on January 30th - three days before he died - and were taken
 by a diner who said the Oscar winning actor was drinking, smoking and 
making repeated suspicious trips to the bathroom

driven away from the flight by an airport cart on landing in the Big 
Apple

Asked if those in attendance were counting their time sober in terms of years, months, weeks or days. Mr. Hoffman said, 'I am counting days,' according to an attendee who spoke to the New York Times.

'He raised his hand and he said his name and he said he had 28 days or 30 days sober,' the person said.

Indeed, it has been reported that his path back into addiction began when he celebrated the wrap party of his 2012 movie, The Master - for which he was nominated for another Oscar.

According to TMZ, Hoffman took a drink, which quickly became a binge session after 23-years on the wagon.

Hoffman is supposed to have told his friends that this opened the floodgates and although he didn't begin taking heroin again - firstly by snorting it - in 2013 - that one drink is what led him to his untimely death.

And as his battle with drink and drugs continued it was taking its toll on his appearance too.

Hoffman's skin had become visibly red, raw and pockmarked - all tell-tale signs of substance abuse - particularly heroin.

On January 25, his friend and writer Tatiana Pahlen ran into Hoffman at the 92nd Street Y in Manhttan where the actor was picking up one of his children.

She noticed that Hoffman seemed happy, if a little hyperactive, but saw that 'his skin was not healthy; his skin was in very bad shape.'

His physical deterioration became so bad that during his return from filming the final Hunger Games movie in Atlanta on Friday January 31st last week, he was mistaken for a street person.

A diner in a downtown restaurant photographed the award winning actor drinking at the bar and making 'multiple', conspicuous trips to the bathroom.

Later that evening, Theresa Fehr saw him at Atlanta Airport, visibly intoxicated, being escorted through a security checkpoint by a Transportation Security Administration agent,

'I just thought it was really odd that this street person was at the airport,' she said to the New York Times.

'He put his shoes on the belt and just threw his belt there. You could tell he was very intoxicated.'

Hoffman died on Sunday

Struggle: Mimi O'Donnell - Philip Seymour 
Hoffman's long time girlfriend and mother of his 3 kids looked visibly 
shaken as she left the West Village apartment they once shared on Wednesday

Fehr watched as the man struggled to put his belt back on after screening and watched his belly hanging out of his pants.

She turned to the nearest agent and said, 'You know, it’s funny, he looks like that actor that has three names.’

She looks at me and goes, ‘Yeah, it is.’

Hoffman was photographed on the flight back to La Guardia slumped in his seat, unconscious and also was pictured being driven away from the gate in a motorized cart.

'He passed me and my fiancée,' said Andrew Kirell, editor of Mediaite, a blog that covers the media. 'It was remarkable how awful he looked.'

However, despite this unedifying public display, Hoffman was up and about on the morning of Saturday, February 1st to order his usual four-shot espresso at his local coffee house.

His friend, screenwriter David Katz, contacted him to ask if he wanted to go for steak soon. Hoffman said he did and the two made plans.

O'Donnell then met the father of her three children at a playground at around 2pm on Saturday afternoon with their kids and told police following his death that he seemed high.

Later on that afternoon at 5pm, Paul Pabst, an executive producer of sports program, the Dan Patrick Show was walking through the West Village with his sister and saw the actor.

'My sister looked at me and said, ‘Wow, he didn’t look good,’ recounted Pabst on the show on Monday.

As Hoffman seemingly staggered through the haze of his last day, he went for dinner at 7.30pm at Automatic Slim's, a popular West Village bar with two other friends.

Hoffman left well before that and was witnessed at the D'Agostino's a stone's throw away from his apartment withdrawing $1,200 in six different transactions over the course of an hour.

The actor was seen with two men who were wearing messenger bags and speculation is rife that they were selling him the drugs that ended his life.

There is no surveillance footage of this transaction and the police are still looking for the drug dealers who sold the Oscar winner heroin.

When Hoffman didn't arrive to collect his children O'Donnell phoned the actor's friend, David Bar Katz and the Oscar winner's personal assistant, British film maker, Isabella Wing-Davey to check on him.

They made the horrifying discovery inside Hoffman's drug den at around 11am on Sunday.

When O'Donnell was told that he had been discovered slumped on the bathroom floor she put her kids in her car, rushed to the West Village apartment and left her children in the running vehicle as she dashed inside, shouting, 'I have to see him!'
