A college student faces 15 years in jail after she allegedly sprayed bleach into her roommate's iced tea.

Kayla Ashlyn Bonkowski, 19, was charged with felony poisoning and appeared in court on Wednesday. She reportedly told police that she had put chemicals in the drink following an argument about cleaning the dishes with her 20-year-old roommate Emily Joseph.

The poisoning occurred on November 7 at the students' apartment in Union Township, located near
 the Mount Pleasant school of Central Michigan University, authorities said.

Miss Joseph was taken to hospital for treatment but later released. After she filed a complaint, Bonkowski was arrested.

The 19-year-old 'verbally admitted' to police that she put bleach in the drink because 'Joseph is mean', according to ABC.

She was arraigned on Wednesday at 2pm before posting $2,000 bond. She entered a plea of not guilty to the charge of  poisoning a food, drink, medicine or water supply. The college student faces up to 15 years in prison.

Reached by e-mail, Bonkowski said on Wednesday morning that she needed to consult with a lawyer before commenting. University officials declined to make a statement at this time.

Bonkowski is scheduled for a preliminary hearing on December 13.
