A luxury resort in Hawaii is offering wealthy guests a once-in-a-life time package complete with private helicopter tours of active volcanoes and a personal concierge – all for the eye-watering sum of $50,000.

Mauna Kea Beach Hotel on Hawaii Island is offering the golden anniversary package as it celebrates its 50th anniversary in 2015.

Guests will live in the lap of luxury for five nights as they are treated to thrilling excursions, romantic dinners and breath-taking views of the volcanic island and the Pacific Ocean.

Mauna Kea Beach Hotel's golden anniversary package includes a private helicopter tour of Hawaii's Volcanoes National Park

When it opened in 1965 the hotel was the first on the picturesque Kohala Coast and the most expensive hotel built at the time

Founded by business tycoon and conservationist Laurance S Rockefeller, the hotel is now operated by Prince Resorts Hawaii

And they will arrive in style as the $50,000 price tag (approximately £32,000) includes round-trip first class airfare for two from any airport in the continental US, plus helicopter transport from Kona International Airport to Mauna Kea Beach Hotel.

At the resort guests will be spoiled with panoramic views from a private suite and exclusive access to a private cabana at the spectacular Kauna’oa Bay.

While there is plenty of opportunity for romance it will be an adventurous stay as the package includes a private helicopter tour of Volcanoes National Park, a private star-gazing event at WM Keck Observatory atop the dormant Mauna Kea volcano, a trek through a forest, unlimited tennis and rounds of golf at an oceanfront course, and a sunset catamaran sail.

Mauna Kea Beach Hotel says the ‘legendary experience’ is designed to pay tribute to its ‘pedigree and timeless charm’

For foodies, the package includes carte blanche dining, reserved VIP seating and a private farm tour with executive chef Hanz Lentz

When the golf course opened in 1964 it was christened with a match involving three of the sport's greatest players - Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player. 

For foodies, guests have carte blanche dining over the length of their stay and reserved VIP seating, and they will be taken on a private farm tour with Hanz Lentz, the hotel’s executive chef, which concludes with a farm-to-table dinner.

The package includes spa treatments, round-the-clock concierge and personal laundry service, and the hotel is planting a coconut or mamane trees on the grounds with name plaques in the guests’ honour.
