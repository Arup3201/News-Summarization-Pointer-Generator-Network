A farmer’s wife died after her husband accidentally dropped a half-tonne steel bucket on her, an inquest heard.

Arthur and Joy Turnbull were mending a fence when Mr Turnbull pressed the wrong button on an agricultral machine and inadvertently released its bucket.

Mother-of-two Mrs Turnbull, 65, was holding a fence post upright when she was crushed underneath the falling bucket and fractured her spine.

Crushed: Joy Turnbull died when her husband Arthur accidentally pressed the wrong button on his Manitou telehandler (similar to the one pictured) and released its half-tonne steel bucket, which then landed on his wife

The inquest into her death heard that as rescue crews arrived at the remote farm in Hooton Pagnell, near Doncaster, Mr Turnbull said: 'I’ve killed her, I’ve killed her.'

Her husband desperately tried to free his wife before fire crews arrived but it took the combined strength of five men to roll the bucket off her.

Mrs Turnbull died a week later in Sheffield’s Northern General Hospital after her brain had been starved of oxygen.

The inquest in Doncaster heard the farmer is believed to have pressed the wrong button on a Manitou telehandler machine as it forced the post into the ground.

Instead of pressing a button for moving the telescopic boom up and down he accidentally pressed the button next to it causing a quick release of the bucket.

Accident: Mrs Turnbull had been helping her husband to mend a fence at their farm in Hooton Pagnell, near Doncaster

The tragedy happened on June 8 last 
year after Mr Turnbull moved a new cow into a field only for it to fail 
to settle and started charging around, breaking the fence.

Mr Turnbull and his wife decided to repair the fence to stop the rest of the herd escaping.

He had used the weight of the Manitou bucket to force two post into the ground and his wife was holding a third post upright.

'I had a clear view,' he told the inquest.

'I put the bucket seven or eight feet into the air and saw I needed to adjust it above the post. It happened so quickly.

'I must have pressed the quick-release
 button which allowed it to fall to the ground. I can only assume when I
 moved the bucket I pressed the wrong button.'

Mr
 Turnbull said the bucket had never fallen off the machine before, 
although other farmers he had spoken to since had also reported 
accidentally hitting the quick-release button.

Health and Safety inspector Michael Raynor told the inquest it was possible the farmer had inadvertently released the locking pins and lowering the bucket onto the post caused it to detach.

No defects were found on the machine and the inquest jury returned a conclusion of accidental death.

After the inquest jury reached a verdict of accidental death, Doncaster coroner Nicola Mundy said she would write to the Health and Safety Exective to raise her concerns about the machine’s control panel in the cab. The Manitous are commonly used on British farms.

In a statement Mrs Turnbull’s’ family said: 'At the heart of what we all miss about Joy is her generosity of spirit. She was a loving wife, mum and gran and cheerfully invested everything she had into her relationships with her family and friends and did so without the need for reward.

'She was regarded as a joyful, optimistic and warm individual who was always delighted to lend a hand, lend a sympathetic ear, or a shoulder to cry on.

'It has been seven months since Joy left us. Those who knew her well still feel it very acutely.'
