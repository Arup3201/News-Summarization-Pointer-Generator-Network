Schoolboy Cory Pingeton walks along a corridor to class, minding his own business.

The 18-year-old does not see the 'sucker punch' that knocks him to the ground, breaking bones in his eye socket, face and bruising his retina.

It came from schoolmate David Salmon, 17, who had been lying in wait to land the blow, before shouting: 'That's what you get for talking about me.'

Unsuspecting: The video shows Cory Pingeton (black top) walking along the corridor and his soon-to-be attacker, David Salmon, casually lying in wait

Salmon had planned it so carefully that he even made a friend record it on his mobile phone to show his friends at Franklin High School, in Massachusetts.

Within minutes the clip was uploaded onto the internet for the world to see.

But the bully forgot one thing... it as all the evidence police needed to prosecute him for assault.

Salmon appeared in court on Monday charged with the brutal and unprovoked attack. He pleaded not guilty to aggravated assault and battery, disturbing school, disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace.

Vicious: The blow knocks Cory to the ground, breaking bones in his eye socket, face and bruising his retina

Officer Donald MacLean wrote in a police report included in court documents that the boy recording the incident makes a sign to Salmon to signal Cory's approach, the Milford Daily News reported.

'(Salmon) then strikes Cory directly in the face, dropping him to the ground,' he wrote, adding that the boy makes a 'slashing throat gesture and then begins to run away'.

Courtroom: Salmon appeared in court on Monday charged with the brutal and unprovoked attack. He pleaded not guilty to aggravated assault and battery, disturbing school, disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace

Bailed: Judge Emogene Johnson-Smith set bail at $1,500 and ordered Salmon to stay away from the school and his victim. He will reappear for a pre-trial hearing in June

Stoic: Cory said, 'It shouldn't happen. It doesn't represent my school well'

Salmon claimed in court that that he had thrown the 'sucker-punch' in retaliation for 'trash talk' made by Cory earlier. Cory denies making any remarks.

Judge Emogene Johnson-Smith set bail at $1,500 and ordered Salmon to stay away from the school and his victim.

He will reappear for a pre-trial hearing in June.

Jeremiah Ramirez, 18,  who taped the attack in his iPod Touch, was also charged.

Speaking of the attack, Cory told WBZ-TV: 'It just shouldn’t happen. It’s not good for the community. It doesn’t represent my school well.

'After the kid hit me he proceeded to say stuff to me and call me a b*** 
as he walked out of the school. I was defenseless.'
