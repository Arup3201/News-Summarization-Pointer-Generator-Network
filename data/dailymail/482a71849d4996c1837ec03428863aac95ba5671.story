David Moyes was meant to appear as a TV pundit for the meeting between two of his old teams but had to cancel because it would have meant missing part of Monday's training session with his new club Real Sociedad.

Fellaini's dose of his own medicine

Marouane Fellaini has been guilty of a few questionable elbows during his time in England but the big Belgian was on the receiving end on Monday night when he got an arm in the face from Bailey Wright and needed treatment on the touchline.

Team-mate Daley Blind, who had been doubtful for this game after going off against Burnley last week with a cut to the head, also came off worse in an aerial collision with Scott Laird in the opening exchanges as Preston got stuck into their Premier League opponents.

Rooney boost for Hodgson 

England boss Roy Hodgson was happy to see Wayne Rooney restored to the role of striker after his recent spell as a midfielder at United. 

The whole business has caused much debate but Hodgson was in no doubt about his captain’s best position as he looked on at Deepdale.

‘At the moment I would like to say he has been a key figure at centre forward for England, and it would take a lot for me to think along those lines of playing him in midfield,’ said Hodgson. ‘It would be a lot of responsibility for a 19-year old to replace a 100-cap man.’

Van Gaal eyes another non-League signing 

Louis van Gaal is set to offer a trial to Southport teenager Andrew Lewis. 

The 19-year-old has scored 38 goals for the Conference club’s reserve side this season and captured the attention of a number of league clubs — but United have moved first. 

The development comes after United handed Sadiq El Fitouri a contract after spotting him at local club Salford City.
