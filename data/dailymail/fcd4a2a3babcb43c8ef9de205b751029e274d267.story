Every bride dreams of the perfect wedding, in the perfect setting with the perfect food.

And for this young couple, they will be getting everything they've always dreamed of for their specialÂ  day - a reception at their favourite McDonald's.

Fast food fans Steven Asher and Emily Marshall will toast their nuptials with a wedding breakfast of chicken nuggets and a Chicken Legend burger under the golden arches.

True love: Steve Asher, 27, and his fiancee Emily Marshall, 20, will hold their wedding reception at their favourite branch of McDonald's, near Bristol

The couple both love eating out at at McDonald's and usually dine there twice a week; it's their restaurant of choice

They will arrive in style in a stretch 
limo and dine with their 40 guests in a roped-off area at their local 
branch in Cribbs Causeway, Bristol.

The couple even hope to have a Champagne toast - but will settle for lemonade if the fast food chain cannot lift its alcohol ban.

Steven, 27, and Emily, 20, are familiar faces at the restaurant and dine out there twice a week when they can afford it.

They decided to celebrate the start of their new life together under the famous golden arches because they want to make it 'as memorable as possible'.

Stephen, who works at a warehouse for a
chilled food company, said: 'A lot of people have said "McDonald's?" 
but we just reply "Why not?".

'It is something different and we like to do things a bit differently.

'It's Emily's favourite - if we ever go out for lunch I always ask her where she wants to go and she always says McDonald's.

Wedding menu: The couple will bring their 40 wedding guests to Cribbs Cause McDonald's, Bristol, where they will feast on chicken nuggets and a 'Legend Meal'

Attention: Bride Emily, 20, said she is not bothered about what other people may think, 'it's just something that we really like,' she said

'Even when I say to her that it can be somewhere posh she still picks McDonald's.

'And we have a saying - what my princess wants, my princess gets.'

The couple, who currently live with Emily's father, in Bristol, got together a year ago after a mutual friend asked Steven to drive Emily home after a night out.

Steven proposed six months later after a string of dates at McDonald's.

They will tie the knot at Bristol Register Office on Saturday, July 27, before riding to the reception in a hired limousine.

Emily's meal of choice will be chicken nuggets while Steven will munch on a 'Legend's Meal' - a chicken sandwich and fries.

They will finish the day at Avonmouth Working Men's Club.

The McDonald's reception was the idea of Emily's mother and the couple jumped at the chance

If the couple can't have any Champagne at their McDonald's reception, they'll happily settle for lemonade, they said

The McDonald's reception was the idea of Emily's mum and the couple jumped at the chance.

Emily, who is a full-time mum to her two-year-old daughter Lily-Rae, said she is not bothered about what people think.

'One of my friends sent me a message on Facebook saying "Are you mad?" but it's just something that we really like,' she explained.

'I'm not worried about people staring at me - you're meant to be the centre of attention on your wedding day, aren't you?'
