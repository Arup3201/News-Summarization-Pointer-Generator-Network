A combination of soft ground and the mile trip were put forward as an excuse for the modest showing of First Class Mail at Chepstow on Thursday.

The Mick Channon-trained colt, who sports the colours of the Daily Mail and Mail Online, struggled on his first try at eight furlongs and jockey Sam Hitchcott feels he may be worth trying over shorter on the all weather.

He said: 'I was pleased how he relaxed and jumped out of the stalls which have been an issue.

'But he couldn't quicken in the sticky ground and hasn't got the trip. Seven furlongs at Wolverhampton may see him in a better light.'
