A family in Brooklyn, New York returned from a recent weekend away to discover that their home had been burgled – and the thief had been caught in the act on their nanny cam.

Footage from the camera shows the burglar, wearing a stocking cap, hooded sweatshirt and gloves, placing an Apple laptop into a bag beside a baby's crib.

The thief made off with $5,000-worth of valuables, including cash and jewelry. The burglar had slipped in through a rear window at the family's Brighton Beach home about 9 p.m. on May 4, police said.
