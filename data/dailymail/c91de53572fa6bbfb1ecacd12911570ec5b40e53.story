Meet Cranberry the turkey, saved from the Christmas dinner table, who now thinks she's a dog. She loves going for walks, lives in a kennel and even 'barks'.

Jerry and Dawn Watkins adopted the bird after she was found wandering around a car park, and the couple were left bemused when the bird took an instant liking to their pet Labradors, Teal and Widgeon — and then started showing dog-like traits.

Mr Watkins, 55, the National Director for Equine Welfare at HorseWorld in Bristol, said: 'We got a call from a member of the public after they had seen her on the loose.

'People in the local area often report animals they've found to the centre. They know we have a lot of different species — not just horses and donkeys.

'Dawn and I live on site and often 
take in waifs and strays. She's a very friendly and affectionate bird. 
We were very careful about introducing her to the dogs, but Cranberry 
seemed unconcerned.

'The dogs were intrigued and just wanted to sniff her.'

Bizarrely, Labradors are bred to hunt
 game birds but in fact, the eight-year-old bird is the leader of the 
pack among her canine friends.

Mr Watkins said: 'She's the head honcho. She will pinch the dog's feed but they would never dream of trying to get it back from her.

'She's now got her own dog bowl for 
her corn and occasional dog biscuits to stop her stealing food from the 
dogs. Every morning, we let them out and the dogs follow her around.

Mr Watkins said they picked up the bird after a member of the public called to say they had seen her on the loose

Mr Watkins, 55, the National Director for Equine Welfare at HorseWorld in Bristol, said Cranberry is a very friendly and affectionate bird

'Once animals get to know each other,
 they understand their body language and behaviour so it doesn't really 
surprise me. The only thing she won't do is fetch. She picks things up 
but just eats them.

'We won't be having turkey this year. We're having beef instead.'

Cranberry has her own kennel right next door to the dogs' day kennel but can often be found relaxing in the house.

Mr Watkins said: 'She loves being stroked.
 If you stroke her, she will go into a relaxed state. She will hunker 
down. It's quite charming.

'Like most dogs, she has her favourite. It's Dawn. She feeds her more than I do.'

Cranberry loves wandering around with the dogs and has even proved a great 'guard dog.'

Mrs Watkins, 34, an equine lecturer at 
Norton Radstock College, said: 'If someone is coming up the garden path,
 she's really useful because she's got her own alert call.

'She likes to be right in your space and will walk to heel — just like a dog.

'She's a big bird and people can get quite disconcerted but it's her being friendly and inquisitive.

'There are not many turkeys who like 
to be stroked and petted. They usually like to be left alone but 
Cranberry wants to be close to you. She's part of the family now.'
