Doreen Giuliano believes her son was wrongly found guilty of murder and she has made it her quest to prove not only that he is innocent, but that one of the jurors that convicted him should never have been on the case.

Mrs Giuliano, then 46, launched her own investigation into juror Jason Allo, then 31, donning short shorts and a recording device and spending hours recording their conversations, resulting in what she thought was explosive testimony, sure to earn John Giuca a mistrial.

However, the Brooklyn District Attorney did not believe her, saying that Giuca did in fact order 19-year-old Mark Fisher to be gunned down in cold blood to raise the profile of his 'Ghetto Mafia' gang and that all her efforts worked against her, saying every bit of evidence she uncovered was tainted and she was nothing more than a vigilante.

Undeterred, she's now demanding that the New York State Governor look at her son's case, as well as her own, and offer him a retrial.

Conviction: The Brooklyn District Attorney did not believe her, saying that her son John Giuca, right, did in fact order 19-year-old Mark Fisher, left, to be gunned down to raise the profile of his 'Ghetto Mafia' gang

In October of 2003, Mark Fisher, 19, a football star from New Jersey, was gunned down in Prospect Park South after a night of bar-hopping.

Found wrapped in a blanket on the street, he was shot five times in the face and chest.

Police accused John Giuca of ordering Mr Fisher's death, saying that he told Antonio Russo to shoot him in order to get street cred for their 'Ghetto Mafia' gang.

In 2005, they were convicted of murder and sentenced to 25 years to life for what was called the 'grid kid' slaying.

But that's when Mrs Giuliano went from the weeping mother at her son's trial to a buxom Brooklyn blonde.

Changing her name from Doreen to Dee, Mrs Giuliano began her quest to prove that Jason Allo, a Bensonhurst contractor, was not only a dishonest juror, but one that sought out to convict her son of the heinous crime because of a personal vendetta.

More than just dying her hair, 'Dee' rented an apartment near Mr Allo's home, joined a gym, got a new cell phone number and assumed a new identity.

She rode her bicycle around and around the block hoping to gain his attention - and she did.

'Every time I went to his neighborhood I would have to wear makeup, have my hair done, wear fake eyelashes,' she told ABC. 'I was prepared to do anything within the law.'

For more than a year, Dee plied Mr Allo with wine and weed, discussing the trial and all the reasons, she says, he should never have been on the case.

'They tried to make him out to be like the Tony Soprano, but he was a f***ing clown,' Mr Allo said in the recordings. 'He's a tall, skinny Jewish kid with glasses.'

He later told her, 'I hate Jews.'

Prejudice aside, the most damning evidence Mrs Giuliano obtained was that Mr Allo knew several of the witnesses - even her son - and disliked them.

'Technically, by law, if I knew that s*** I shouldn't have even been in that jury,' he said on the tape. 'By law, you're not supposed to be. Because they ask you in the beginning when you go to jury duty if … they read you a list of all the witnesses.'

Her sting operation was not without its difficulties. Her husband, Frank, would stay up until late when she returned from her sessions with Mr Allo.

'Even when I was home, I wasn’t home,' she told the New York Post.

'Husbands are always second when you have kids. So when you say you’d do anything for your kid, you mean it. If I’m gonna lose Frank over my son, so be it. You could always get another husband.'

In 2010, she filed an appeal with her attorney, alleging juror misconduct and demanded that her son be re-tried.

'[T]he defendant’s motion reveals extraordinary misconduct,' the judge's ruling read, 'not by a juror, but by the woman who generated the motion — the defendant’s mother.'

The judge ruled that the tapes of evidence were 'selectively recorded' and there was no way of knowing whether they had been manipulated.

Her allegations fell on deaf ears, the judge saying that her own deceits made her an unreliable source, not to mention her obvious bias.

Mrs Giuliano still hasn't given up. Fueled by the judge's rejection, she has now appealed to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, demanding that he hold a new trial outside of Brooklyn so that hopefully, justice will finally prevail.
