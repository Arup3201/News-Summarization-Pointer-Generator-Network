Just a few short years ago, long, straight hair was everywhere you looked. From the catwalk to the red carpet and the high street, flicky locks and honeyed highlights were everywhere.

Now, thanks to Rihanna and other celebrities willing to brave the chop, things have changed. From pink hair to undercuts, pixie crops, fringes and ombre, Britain's streets are awash with different colours, shapes and styles.

But your choice of cut says more about you than you realise - and plays a huge role in the way you feel about yourself.

'Hair is called a secondary sexual characteristic,' says leading trichologist Philip Kingsley. 'You can't flaunt your primary sexual characteristics in public, at least not in western society, so that's what makes your hair important from a social viewpoint.

'It's about sexuality and morale. Lots of women - and men - find that if they are not happy with their hair, then they are unhappy people.'

And it's precisely because hair is a secondary sexual characteristic that long, glossy hair - which denotes youth and fertility - has been so popular for so long.

As a result, short, cropped styles are widely considered masculine, according to Karin Lesnik-Oberstein, a professor of critical theory at the University of Reading and editor of The Last Tabooo: Women And Body Hair.

'Short hair is still equated with masculinity,' she revealed in an interview with the Observer Magazine.

'I have very short hair and in England, I often get mistaken for a man. That never happens to me on the continent - for instance in Germany and Holland, where a lot of these societies are more egalitarian and matriarchal.'

But despite the explosion in different styles ('It's not one iconic haircut anymore,' reveals award-winning stylist, Luke Hersheson), long, glossy locks not only remain the default option for many, they're also seen as the most glamorous.

According to fashion historian Caroline Cox, the dominant trend today is for styling rather than cutting and for 'long, glamorous hair and lots of it.'

It's a look that cuts across social classes and is as likely to be spotted on TOWIE stars as it is on royalty, albeit with a few crucial differences.

From the Duchess of Cambridge and Kim Sears' blow-dried locks - in both cases the mark of a woman with the time and money to spend on her hair - to Kim Kardashian and Amy Childs' extravagant extensions, long hair is glamorous no matter what.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the UK is now the third-largest importer of human hair in the world, with Â£38m worth entering the country every year.

'It's a traditional idea of female glamour and it's kind of boring,' adds Cox. 'It's the whole pole dancer look: huge heads of artificial hair, faces that look like they've been dipped in a bucket of make-up, ultra short skirts and huge stripper heels.

'In terms of fashion and feminism, it's like "oh my God, what was I fighting for?"'

Nevertheless, long 'natural' hair that waves or curls is seen as likeable, and in Sears and the Duchess of Cambridge's case, demure.

Colour too is changing, with blondeness - once regarded as a signifier of youth - becoming dated thanks to the large numbers of older women who wear it.

'Blondeness used to be a sign of youth,' adds Cox. 'Now because so many women post-50 are dyeing their hair blonde, it's a sign of maturity and young women are increasingly dyeing their hair in a grey tone that's almost silver or pale blue.'

Ultimately, we're slowly moving away from the identikit blonde, straightened look that dominated the noughties and Hersheson, in particular, is thrilled.

'People used to embrace having the same haircut as Jennifer Aniston,' he explains. 'Now there are 20 or 30 new trends and individuality is so much more important.'
