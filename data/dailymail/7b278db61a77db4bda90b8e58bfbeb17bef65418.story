It is not often a policeman has women throwing themselves at his feet begging to be cuffed. But then Grant Hazell is no ordinary policeman.

The 35-year-old police officer, who hails from Suffolk but lives in Perth, Australia, is the doppelganger of Hollywood heartthrob Ryan Gosling.

In fact, his incredible likeness to the film star has thrust him into the limelight, with strangers refusing to believe he is not the real deal.

Handsome Grant Hazell, 35, makes £200 an hour as a Ryan Gosling lookalike

With his trademark chiselled jaw and mesmerising smile, the resemblance sees him attract attention everywhere he goes - and even marriage proposals from women all over the world.

One super female fan even refused to believe Grant was not the real life Ryan Gosling when she stopped him in the street.

'She told me she had seen all my movies and that she was in love with me. When I said I wasn't actually him, she didn't believe me. It was a surreal conversation,' Grant joked.

'He's a cool guy and a great actor. It's not a bad thing to look like one of Hollywood's most wanted men.'

Grant was living a normal, albeit slightly charmed, life until May when he finally turned professional..

The handsome father-of-two was snapped up by a talent agency as a Ryan Gosling lookalike after his wife, Caroline, 35, sent off some photographs, convinced that he was a dead ringer for the star.

Grant quickly realised his resemblance to the Notebook actor when Gosling burst onto the movie scene with the film Crazy Stupid Love and friends and family commented on the similarities.

As Gosling's star rose, Grant too became more popular and has since landed modelling contracts and hundreds of followers worldwide.

Grant, 35, said: 'Ryan Gosling has a very contemporary look which is very sought after in both the film and fashion industry.

'I don't find it hard impersonating him. I'm lucky that it comes quite naturally. I frown a lot which helps.

'I've really taken to modelling, it's such good fun and I hope I get to travel the world to do it.

'I'm a very lucky guy to have been given this opportunity.'

The doppelganger has perfected Gosling's trademark poses and emulates the smouldering frown and tough guy exterior many people love about the movie star.

He's lookalike work has been the talk of his friends and family - even his work colleagues now call him 'Ryan'.

Grant added: 'My work mates think it's hilarious and one day when I went into work they'd put my picture up on the most wanted list, saying 'crimes against impersonating a celebrity'.

'I get quite a lot of joke emails from fellow officers and they have posters up of me and Ryan Gosling to show the comparison.

'They call me 'the most beautiful man in the cosmos'. They all find it quite amusing.'

One American woman became so obsessed with Grant that she sent him more than 100 raunchy messages on Facebook.

But to his swooning female admirers' disappointment, Grant is happily married to movie make-up artist Caroline and the couple have two sons, Alex, 10 and Sonny, eight.

The couple met as teenagers and have been married for 13-years.

After working as a mechanic in the army for six years and then a policeman for seven years, Grant opted for a change of scenery and emigrated with his family to Australia five years ago.

Caroline, who has no complaints about being married to a hunky lookalike, said: 'At first Grant didn't seem interested in the fact he resembled Gosling and when I surprised him with a DVD of his film Crazy Stupid Love, he wasn't impressed.

'He refused to watch the film and was embarrassed that I suggested he looked like him. I loved the fact that he was the spitting image of Gosling.'

Not wanting to see his natural talents go to waste, Caroline sent his photo to a lookalike agency in Melbourne without him knowing.

To his surprise, they loved his look and signed him up on the spot.

Since then he has been signed by a US lookalike agency and has modelled for commercial brands and men's fashion magazines earning him up to £200 an hour. He has even appeared in a magazine posing as Ryan as well as undertaking personal appearances as the Drive star.

Caroline said: 'I've always thought Grant was gorgeous and women often fancied him. But since he's been working as a lookalike. the attention's gone through the roof.'

'The boys are so proud of their dad.

'Despite being a looker, he is very down to earth family man.

'Women propose to him on Facebook and girls even run up to him on the street, screaming with excitement wanting a picture.'

Fortunately, Caroline isn't the jealous type and knows Grant only has eyes for her.

Even though Grant receives hundreds of propositions from admirers he still keeps his feet firmly on the ground and doesn't let the attention go to his head.

He said: 'People think I'm a heartthrob, but I'm not. I wash dishes, bath the dog. I'm a regular bloke. My family at home keep me grounded.'
