Harry Redknapp insists Loic Remy could not have failed a medical at Liverpool and says there must be another reason for his transfer falling through.

The Queens Park Rangers striker was set to complete his move to Liverpool on Sunday having joined them on their US tour, only for the Reds to announce he had failed a medical.

But Redknapp believes it is impossible for Remy’s fitness to be the real reason behind the collapse of the £8.5million deal.

‘I don’t see how he has failed a 
medical. It doesn’t make sense,’ said the R’s boss at the unveiling of 
new signing Rio Ferdinand on Monday.

‘He had a stringent medical here, one at Marseille, one at Newcastle and one with France before the World Cup.

‘He’s never had a problem with his fitness. You could not meet a fitter lad. There can’t be any issue with his fitness.

‘I
 can’t see a medical reason. There must be other reasons. That (failing 
medical) is not possible. There has to be another reason.

‘He has 
never failed a medical before. He’s never had a problem and didn’t miss a
 game at Newcastle (where he spent last season on loan).

‘They must have changed their mind or decided to go in another direction.’

Remy could now return to Loftus Road, and that is something Redknapp would welcome.

‘He
 will come back here,’ he said.‘Their loss is our gain. I have got a 
fantastic striker capable of scoring 20 goals in the Premier League.

‘We need him now to come in here and get 20 goals. So from a selfish point of view I have got a great striker.

‘If he is here we will be delighted to have him back.’
