This was the terrifying moment a boy racer lost control of his Ford Fiesta at an unauthorised 'car cruise' and ploughed into a crowd of spectators.

Witnesses say the young driver was allegedly trying to impress spectators by pulling off a huge wheel spin at a B&Q car park in Plymouth, Devon, when he injured 17 people.

Horrifying mobile phone footage shows the car suddenly shooting forward and veering off the makeshift drag strip.

Spectators were injured after a Ford Fiesta which was taking 
part in a 'car meet' in Plymouth, Devon, veered off the makeshift drag 
and ploughed into a group of spectators, injuring 17 people

During the event, which was arranged through Facebook, drivers took turns to show off 
their 'static techniques' where they rev their engines and spin their 
wheels on the spot

Megan Whitlock, 16, was one of those injured and had to be rushed to hospital with cuts and bruises to her face.

The teenager said she remembers crashing into the windscreen but cannot recall anything else about the accident.

She said: 'We were watching all the cars and I remember feeling really dizzy, like I'd been hit by something and opening my eyes and loads of people crowding around me and leaning over me and taking pictures.

'I have got to go back and have my arm checked but it's just a case of waiting for it to heal - I think I'm pretty lucky really.'

The incident took place on Saturday night when a huge crowd, including kids in prams, met up for an unauthorised cruise, or a 'car meet', which was organised via Facebook.

Drivers took turns to show off their 'static techniques', where they rev their engines and spin their wheels on the spot to produce a huge cloud of smoke.

Chief Inspector Ben Deer said the events were a legal gathering of car enthusiasts but the injuries had been a cause for concern

Organisers Plymouth Car Cruise said on Facebook: 'We wish all those involved last night a speedy recovery.

'The cruise is so people can see all the cars out there and not for people to try and act [like] idiots.'

Chief Inspector Ben Deer, head of local policing in Plymouth, said: 'The events are a legal gathering of members of the public who are car enthusiasts.

'We have no concern with people viewing cars but clearly when injuries are caused that causes us concern.

The damaged Ford Fiesta, which appears to have been customised, was stopped by police officers after the spectators were injured

Megan Whitlock, 16, was one of the spectators mowed to the ground after the car veered into the crowd during the event on Saturday

'These have been going on for some time without an incident and so, as a result, policing has reduced on them because we haven't had an issue.

'Now, we will look at any future car cruises we have in the city and will police them appropriately to reduce this risk of injury.'

B&Q said the gathering had taken place 'without the knowledge or consent' of the company or the landlord who owns the site and car park.

Car cruising usually involves groups of people gathering in car parks to watch drivers speeding, driving in convoy, racing other vehicles and performing stunts.

In many areas across the UK, injunctions have been imposed, making these gatherings illegal.

A 19-year old man from east Cornwall man 
was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving in connection with the incident and released on police 
bail until September.
