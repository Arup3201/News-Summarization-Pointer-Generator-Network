Nick Clegg has ordered a last-ditch fight back to claim credit for the economic revival.

The summer offensive will seek to answer the question ‘what have the Lib Dems ever done for us?’ as polls show the Tories are credited with the return to growth.

But while Mr Clegg and his closest ally Danny Alexander promise to 'face-off' with George Osborne, Vince Cable is has gone off-message by grumbling about low wages.

New figures on Friday showed Britain’s economy has finally bounced back from the deepest recession in post-war history.

Growth of 0.8 per cent between April and June draws a line under the worst downturn the nation has faced.

Chancellor George Osborne declared: ‘Thanks to the hard work of the British people, today we reach a major milestone in our long term economic plan.'

It means the economy is now larger than before the 2008 financial crisis.

However, the Lib Dems fear they are getting none of the credit for the turnaround.

Now Mr Clegg’s party has drawn up Operation Roman, named after the running joke in after Monty Python's Life of Brian when fed-up protesters complain: ‘What have the Romans ever done for us?’

Britain's economy grew by 0.8 per cent in the three months to June, taking the total size of the economy back to levels not seen since before the financial crisis hit in 2007

It has taken much longer for the UK economy to return to pre-crash levels than it did after recessions in the 1970s and 1990s

Mr Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and Mr Osborne’s deputy, is planning to use speeches and leaflets sent to activists to insist the recovery would not happening without the Lib Dems.

He told the Sunday Times: ‘It is spelling out the answer to the question: what have the Liberal Democrats ever done for us?

‘As Liberal Democrats it's our single biggest challenge over the next few months to make sure that we get our fair share of the credit for the recovery.

‘’Every single headline is Osborne this, Osborne that. But the truth is that none of what has happened could have happened without the Lib Dems. We will be aggressively putting our case across.

‘It is also going to mean that Osborne and I are going to have to battle in public. It's a battle for headlines and for airtime to get that message out there.

‘If that means George and I face off from time to time, that's absolutely fine.’

It has taken six long years to reverse the decline which began in early 2008 and saw the economy shrink by 7.2 per cent by the middle of 2009.

The International Monetary Fund now expects the UK economy to grow by 3.2 per cent in 2014 and 2.7 per cent in 2015.

The uplift of 0.4 points for this year and 0.2 points for next year is the largest boost for any major economy in the world.

But Mr Cable, the Lib Dem Business Secretary, has been accused of focussing on the negatives instead of trumpeting his party’s success.

Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable has gone off-message, grumbling about the low level of wage growth

In a series of regional newspaper articles he highlighted how while employment levels are improving strongly, pay growth has fallen to just 0.3 per cent, lagging well behind inflation at 1.9 per cent.

In a South West newspaper he said: 'Wages have only grown by 0.1 per cent in the last year.'

And he added that Yorkshire and the Humber ‘wages grew by just 0.5 per cent in the last year’.

Chris Leslie, the shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said: 'Vince Cable has admitted what David Cameron and George Osborne refuse to recognise about this government's economic record ... wages have been growing more slowly than prices and are now down over £1,600 a year since 2010,' he said.

'But Vince Cable and the Lib Dems are part of a government that's failing to tackle this cost-of-living crisis while giving millionaires a huge tax cut. Labour's economic plan will make Britain better off and fairer for the future.'
