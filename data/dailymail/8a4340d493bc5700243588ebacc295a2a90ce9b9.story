A family have told how their son's deteriorating condition in hospital turned into a heart-breaking custody battle that stripped them of their right to visit their child.

Bret Bohn, 27, went to hospital in his home state of Alaska after developing a relatively minor case of nasal polyps - overgrowths in the nose - last fall.

He was an athletic, healthy man who worked as a field guide for hunters.

But after the polyps were surgically removed, the growths came back and he was prescribed Prednisone, an anti-inflammatory medication.

Mr Bohn's family say it had a devastating effect on him. Soon afterwards, he started to have trouble sleeping, they said.

In October, his parents, Glenn and Lorraine, took their son
 to the Providence Medical Center in Anchorage for severe insomnia. Doctors there 
prescribed drugs and sent him home.

Mr Bohn's health then deteriorated rapidly and, after a 
seizure, his family decided to take him back to the hospital, TheBlaze reported.

In the hospital, Mr Bohn was unable to 
sleep for some 24 days and his mental faculties were significantly 
diminished.

His parents said that at this point they assumed power of 
attorney over him, using a written agreement allowing them to make 
medical decisions for him.

More than 35 lab tests were conducted to diagnose Mr Bohn at Providence Medical Center (pictured) in Anchorage

That agreement was initially drawn up in 
2007, when Mr Bohn was a healthy 20-year-old.

More
 than 35 lab tests were conducted to diagnose Mr Bohn. Meanwhile, his family said, doctors were medicating him with 
dozens of drugs, rendering him in a state of 'delirium.'

At one point, 
they said, Mr Bohn became so frustrated that he attempted to leave the 
hospital on his own, but was talked down by his parents.

That's
 when his family, who contend the hospital's course of treatment made 
their son worse, asked for a second opinion or different course of 
medical action.

They say they were denied and were not permitted to 
withdraw their son from the hospital. Eventually, a custody battle broke out. A judge ultimately ruled in favor of the state.

Mr Bohn's mother Lorraine said: 'It's a nightmare that this even could be happening. I'm heartbroken, very heartbroken'

Now, Mr Bohn is a ward of the 
state and has been diagnosed with a mental-disorder, which has resulted 
in doctors heavily medicating him with various drugs, his family said.

'I hurt â€” I cry every day and every night. It's a nightmare,' Mr Bohn's mother Lorraine told KTUU-TV. 'It's a nightmare that this even could be happening. I'm heartbroken, very heartbroken.

'You know, I can't help but to blame myself,' she said.

The last time Mr Bohn's saw him was during a short supervised Christmas Day visit and his birthday was last month, according to The Blaze.

Barbara Dick, of Alaska's Adult Protective Services department, said: 'We can't just come in and take away somebody's right and say, "That's it,"

'We have to take it to court and we have our state attorneys with us and we have to have the evidence to support that.'

A spokesman for Providence Medical Center said he was unable to comment to on the case due to privacy laws.

But he did say: 'Health care providers are required by state law to make reports of harm to Adult Protective Services whenever they have reasonable cause to believe a vulnerable adult suffers from abuse or neglect.

'Health care providers are permitted under state law, and required by their standard of care, to decline to comply with the direction of a surrogate if they determine that the surrogate is not abiding by the wishes, values, and best interest of the patient.'

A Facebook page called 'Free Bret Bohn,' shows individuals picketing, demanding the 27-year-old's release.
