A high-street clothing retailer is selling a parody T-shirt which features some of the world's most notorious dictators such as Adolf Hitler, Muammar Gaddafi and Saddam Hussein.

Urban Outfitters - which is based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and has 24 stores across the UK - is selling the white T-shirt for £32 and it features the black heading of 'D.W.A. - Dictators with Attitude'.

The T-shirt, which is listed as an ‘online exclusive’ on the company’s website, jokes that Gaddafi, Hitler and Hussein are in the ‘world's most notorious rap group’ along with Idi Amin and Kim Jong-Il.

In stock: Urban Outfitters - which is based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but has 24 stores across the UK - is selling the white t-shirt for £32 and it features the black heading 'D.W.A. - Dictators with Attitude'

The T-shirts appear to have been based 
on the 'N.W.A.' slogan of 'N****z Wit Attitudes', an Eighties and Nineties US rap 
quintet known as 'the world's most dangerous group'.

The firm, which has more than 130 stores worldwide, offers ‘a lifestyle-specific shopping experience for the educated, urban-minded individual in the 18 to 30-year-old range’, according to its website.

The 'new in' T-shirt, available in small, medium, large or extra-large, is offered by Urban Outfitters for delivery within four working days for £4 - or customers can pay £10 for the next working day.

The retailer's decision to stock the T-shirt was attacked by Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust.

She told MailOnline: 'These T-shirts are in incredibly poor taste, and offensive to all victims and survivors who have suffered from oppression, tyranny and genocide.'

Thor Halvorssen, CEO of Human Rights Foundation, added: ‘We are not surprised about the new line by Urban Outfitters putting dictators in a comical light. There is plenty of room for humour in the fight against dictatorship.

‘Sadly, this line of apparel struggles with one key aspect of parody: it needs to be funny. This isn't. It's just silly.

'It appears to be their trademark at Urban Outfitters to create offensive products that make light of the untold suffering of millions of people.

‘That said, the creative staff and owners of Urban Outfitters have a right, in a free society, to peddle their wares, no matter how offensive or how silly.

Message: The t-shirt jokes that Muammar Gaddafi, Saddam Hussein, Idi Amin, Kim Jong-Il, Idi Amin and Adolf Hitler are in the 'world's most notorious rap group'

'And we have a right as private citizens to request that they reconsider.’

MailOnline asked the Urban Outfitters press office for comment but received no immediate response.

In
October, Urban Outfitters attracted criticism from the Human Rights 
Foundation group in New York for offering T-shirts with the image of 
Argentine revolutionary leader Ernesto ‘Che’ Guevara.

The organisation wrote to Urban 
Outfitters to complain that they were using a photo of ‘a brutal tyrant 
who suppressed individual freedom in Cuba and murdered those who 
challenged his worldview’.

A total of 10 stores contacted by the Huffington Post following the letter said they no longer stocked Guevara shirts - and links that once led to the products online instead said they were not available.

Last month Urban Outfitters faced another backlash as parents of teenagers discovered a Christmas brochure full of f-bombs and other unseasonal greetings on books, mugs and other gifts.

There was a book entitled 'Let’s f***ing reminisce', an 'It was all f***ing awesome' photo album and a mug and wrapping paper stating ‘Merry Christmas b*****s’.
