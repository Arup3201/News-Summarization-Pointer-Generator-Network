Died: Jamal Al Jamale 56, died this afternoon following the blast

The Palestinian ambassador to the Czech Republic has died after an explosion at his apartment in Prague.

Ambassador Jamel al-Jamal was taken to hospital with serious injuries from the blast this morning and put in a medically induced coma, but died this afternoon.

The 56-year-old diplomat was in the flat with his family at the time of the explosion.

The Palestinian Foreign Ministry said the explosion occurred when the ambassador was moving an old office safe box.

It
 was not immediately clear how the explosives ended up in the safe box, 
but the ministry said the blast was being investigated.

A 52-year old woman was also taken to the hospital after suffering from shock.

The ambassador's flat is in Prague's Suchdol neighbourhood.

'There has been a detonation of a so-far unidentified explosive mixture,' spokeswoman Andrea Zoulova said.

'At the moment it is impossible to specify what kind of explosive it was. A search ... is under way at the moment,' she said.

A Palestinian official from Ramallah 
said: 'This explosion happened at his house. He recently moved there. He
 was taken to hospital. An investigation is under way.'

A
 second Palestinian source told Reuters, 'He moved an old case with him 
to the new house from the old house. And when he opened it, the 
explosion happened.'

There were no visible signs of damage to the house from the street, according to a Reuters reporter at the scene.

Police cordoned off part of the street and half dozen police vehicles, two firetrucks and two ambulances were there.
