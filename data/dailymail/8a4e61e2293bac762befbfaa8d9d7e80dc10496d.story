A professor of physics who oversaw one of the world's longest and most painstaking experiments has died without ever seeing it in action.

John Mainstone, former head of the department of physics at the University of Queensland, was custodian of the Pitch Drop Experiment for 52 years.

The experiment began in 1927 by Thomas Parnell was designed to show that pitch, although it feels solid, will act like a fluid and flows through a glass funnel over time.

John Mainstone (pictured), former head of the department of physics at the University of Queensland, was custodian of the Pitch Drop Experiment for 52 years. Only eight drops have fallen in the 83 years since the pitch began dripping, and no-one has ever seen one fall

Three years after the experiment began, the glass funnel holding the pitch was cut to allow it to 'flow'. 

Only eight drops have fallen in the 83 years since the pitch began dripping, and no-one has ever seen one fall. 

Earlier this year Professor Mainstone, who died last week aged 78 following a stroke, said he expected the next drop would fall by the end of this year.

'It's got a mind of its own and in blink of an eye it can drop,' Professor Mainstone, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

'John's death is particularly sad as in his time as the custodian of the experiment, he did not see a single drop fall,' said Professor Rubinsztein-Dunlop.

The experiment is now under constant surveillance, with three webcams trained on it to capture the ninth drop's fall on camera. It can be viewed here.

Last month, the researchers at at Trinity College Dublin captured the fall of a drop of tar pitch on camera for the first time ever.

Drops take between seven and 13 years to fall and this is the first time a drop has been recorded on camera - a similar experiment in Australia missed filming its latest drop in 2000 because the camera was turned off.

Pitch is the name for any 'viscoelastic, solid polymer'.

It can be made from petrol and is also known as tar, bitumen or asphalt.

Pitch can also be produced in plants, known as resin and it is used to waterproof sails and ships.

Physicists from Trinity College claimed the viscosity of the pitch in its experiment is around 2
million times more viscous than honey, or 20 billion times the 
viscosity of water.

How quickly the tar drops depends on the exact composition of the pitch, and the environment its in.

It can be directly affected by temperature and vibrations.

Scientists used to think glass was a slow-moving liquid, because old church window panes are thicker at the bottom, but this
is now considered a solid.

Pitch-drop experiments involve heating a sample of solid pitch to increase the material's viscosity - ability to flow.

It is then poured into a sealed glass funnel.

The tar is left to settle before the stem of the funnel is removed to create a hole for the pitch to drop from. 

The Dublin experiment is believed to be the second oldest pitch-form test.

However, the origins of the Dublin experiment are less known than the Parnell test.

According to the journal Nature, it is believed to have been started by a professor at the Irish university, Ernest Walton, in 1944 to promote how science experiments can be used for education purposes.

No-one was watching the drop and it's believed many fell without being recorded. 

Physicists
at the college set up a webcam last April to start monitoring the 
experiment again and at around 5pm on 11 July the first drop was filmed 
falling.

The Australian experiment has been much more widely documented and is in the Guinness Book of World Records for being the world's longest running scientific experiment.

It is also believed to have enough pitch in the funnel to last for another hundred years.

Professor Mainstone was custodian of the experiment that is on public display 
at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia.

Since starting at the university in the early 60s he missed all five drops that had fallen.

Since
the webcam was erected next to the experiment it has attracted a large 
and devoted following of barmy boffins and amateur enthusiasts from 
around the world.

Indeed, Professor Mainstone had said that he was surprised to receive emails from the Inuit people who were watching the experiment online.

As more drops fall the gaps between them will grow, so the next drop could be the last one for decades.

Professor John 
Mainstone is now custodian of the experiment that is on public display 
at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia.

Since starting at the university in the early 60s he has missed all five drops that have fallen.

He hopes to be present when the next one - which has grown into a perfect teardrop shape - finally falls from the funnel.

As more drops fall the gaps between them will grow, so the next drop could be the last one for decades.

Recalling a conversation with Thomas Parnell's son, Professor Mainstone once said: ‘Other people in the physics department didn't take much interest in it. The students probably laughed at him.

‘It became something of a real oddity 
and was hidden away in a cupboard and when I started I had to convict 
the department to put it on display. There were people who thought it 
should just be thrown out.

Professor Thomas Parnell (1881-1948), conceived the now famous Australian Pitch Drop Experiment

Parnell as a Lieutenant in the AIF, serving in France during the latter part of WWI and into 1919

The earlier drops that fell during the Australian experiment have now flattened

‘Before he died in 1948, Parnell would have been there for two drops, so I've been there for many more than him. But no one has ever actually watched one fall.

‘The last time it happened I was in London and I got an email saying it was getting close, but I wasn't worried because we had a camera on it.

‘Then I got an email to say it had happened, which was followed by another email to say the camera had not worked. Hopefully the technology is better now.

‘The closest I have been to seeing a drop live is five minutes away, and on another occasion I left the university thinking it would not drop at least until the next day, but when when I arrived in the morning it had happened.

‘It is very difficult to judge when it is going to drop. But as it gets nearer the pitch hangs by filaments and when one of those breaks it goes.

‘Pitch is not a homogeneous substance and is a complex mix of hydrocarbons so it is difficult to predict what will happen, especially as the conditions have changed with the introduction of air conditioning.

‘People from around the world get in touch about it - and not just from English speaking countries.

‘I've even had emails from Inuit people. There really are pitch drop devotees.

‘Former students come back to the university with their children and grandchildren and look at the experiment and say it looks exactly the same.'

He added: ‘I hope it continues to run after I'm gone, I think there are another 100 years left and the gaps between drops will get longer and longer.’
