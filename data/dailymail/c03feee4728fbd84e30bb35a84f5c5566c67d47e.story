Jailed: Edmund Bruton has been sentenced to a minimum of seven and a half years after driving his car into his ex-girlfriend's home in a suicide bid

A spurned lover who drank a bottle of antifreeze before driving his car at 80mph into his ex-girlfriend's home in an attempted suicide has been jailed indefinitely.

Edmund Bruton, 42, from Wembley, said he wanted to 'go out causing as much damage as he could' when he drove his Peugeot into the home of former partner Tara Lavery in Caversham, Berkshire.

Inner London Crown Court also heard that Bruton had wedged a 'garden fork' into the steering wheel of the car in an attempt to kill himself during the impact.

Police also found a screwdriver in the foot-well of the car, which Bruton claimed he had lodged into the sun visor.

The jury also heard Bruton texted his former partner minutes before the crash Bruton saying: 'I will be waiting for you in hell' and 'you could have avoided this if you answered me.'

The impact destroyed the garden brick 
wall and the front bay window before the car stopped in Mrs Lavery's front 
room. It caused £62,000 of damage to the house.

He was found of guilty of damaging property with intent to endanger life and dangerous driving.

He was jailed for a minimum term of seven and half years and disqualified from driving for life.

In passing sentence Judge Lindsay Burn said the Bruton had manipulated the 'extreme form of domestic abuse' as a suicide attempt after his six month relationship with Mrs Lavery came to an end.

Judge Burn said it was merely by chance that more damage was done to the occupants of the house. 

Scene: Bruton drove through a wall and bay window at the home in Caversham before coming to a rest in the living room. The crash caused more than £60,000 of damage

He said: 'This is a most disturbing and worrying case. On the evidence heard by the jury you were at the end of a relationship with the former partner and the relationship was being ended by her.

'You could not accept that the relationship was over. You became more and more depressed.

'Your ex-partner did everything in her power to help you during this time meeting with you and talking with you.

Escape: Tara Lavery, Bruton's ex-partner, was left uninjured by the impact. The couple were together for six months

'Your response to all this was to set out in a meticulously planned way to not only plan your own death but planned to cause serious and endanger the life of your ex-partner and the children.

'This was planned not just over a few hours but over days. You went to the lengths of arranging your will, fashioning a garden fork, of buying anti-freeze and went to the length of conducting a reconnaissance visit the night before in the middle of the night.

'Your intention was not only to take your own life but to do as much damage and endanger the life of your ex-partner.'

Judge Burn added he did not believe the two puncture wounds in his neck were caused by the impact but instead were self-inflicted before the crash.

He added the anti-freeze he drank and the puncture wounds he had inflicted would have been enough to take his life.

He said: 'You knew you were going to die before driving in the way you did. But you deliberately drove into her house, knowing that she was inside and you intended to do so in a way that endangered life.'

'It is merely by chance that no more damage was done to the occupants of the house and that their injuries were not more serious or in fact fatal.'

Bruton begged the judge to take in consideration his sick mother who was in the 'last throes of her life' and even made reference to the human rights act.

He said he bore his ex-partner no animosity and wished her and the family well.

He said: 'I apologise for the pain I have caused Tara and her family and I apologise to her without reservation.'
