TSA screeners at Newark Liberty International Airport lost a woman who reportedly tested positive for explosives on Sunday and only put the airport on lock-down when she boarded a flight to Cleveland, Ohio.

Earlier in the day, the Transportation Security Administration at the airport misplaced a piece of checked luggage that had also tested positive for explosives and couldn't find it for 45 minutes. The bomb squad cleared the oversize bag -- but only two and a half hours after it was discovered.

The security failures caused more than 100 flights at the busy airport to be cancelled and dozens more delayed as furious passengers waited for hours -- only to learn their planes were not going to take off.

Furious: Fliers stood in line for hours after the security bungle at Newark Liberty International Airport

Scare: This is the test that flagged an over-sized checked bag -- which the TSA then lost for 45 minutes and sent to the tarmac

About 8.45am, a woman slipped through a TSA checkpoint at Terminal C before being fully screened.

Fox 5 New York reported that the woman was flagged in a preliminary test for explosives.

The TSA refused to comment on the report that possible explosives were involved.

Security officials somehow lost track of the woman and allowed her into the terminal.

That's when officials put the airport on lock down 'out of an abundance of caution,' according to a TSA statement.

Authorities only realized the woman had boarded her flight once it had already landed in Cleveland, the Newark Star-Ledger reported.

The woman was never questioned or screened again and officials do not know her name or identity.

Two hours prior, at 6.30am, a routine screening flagged an over-sized checked bag as possibly containing explosives, Fox New York reports.

Grounded: The security breach brought flights at Newark to a halt on Sunday -- but this was not the first time this has happened

That bag also slipped through the hands of security agents and made it to the tarmac, where it sat for more than 45 minutes before it was discovered.

The Essex County Sheriff's Office bomb squad was called and inspected the bag two hours later and found no threat.

This is only the latest blunder for the TSA in Newark. In June, eight screeners were fired sleeping on duty after photos emerged of a TSA employee reportedly dozing in front of a monitor when she was supposed to be looking out for bombs.

The TSA at Newark Liberty International Airport is headed by Don Drummer, who has been in the post a little over a year.

The TSA issued only a short statement about the breach and declined to answer questions about how it happened.

A spokeswoman said only that the agency was going to 'review the situation.'

Passengers on Sunday were furious about the cancellations.

'They should be on their game. If we have to go through this massive process -- we have to take off our shoes and  go through the possibility of being strip-searched the least they can do is to do their jobs if we're going to go through all of that,' said one angry flier.
