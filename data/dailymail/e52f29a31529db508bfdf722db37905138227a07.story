Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears' matchy-matchy double denim look may have gone down as one of the biggest fashion faux pas in history but it seems that the style shocker is coming back to haunt us next season. 

Ralph Lauren has just unveiled its  Purple Label and Polo Ralph Lauren Spring 2015 collections and there's not one, but two double-denim suits - in fact, one includes a waistcoat, making it a triple denim ensemble.

The menswear range includes a washed-out denim jacket and matching rolled-up boyfriend jeans, as well as the more sharply-cut dark denim suit with matching denim waistcoat.

Dapper:
 Lauren says his range is targeted at a 'very sophisticated guy with a 
point of view who wants chic suits and sportswear'

Double denim is back! Ralph Lauren has just unveiled its  Polo Ralph Lauren Spring 2015 collection and there's two denim on denim looks

Lauren, whose label is undergoing major global expansion, said his collection of sleek and modern silhouettes is targetted at a 'very sophisticated guy with a point of view who wants chic suits and sportswear.'

'This is a man's wardrobe,' he said of his double and single-breasted suits paired with high-collar shirts.

'The look is simple, beautiful and easy to wear. And it's stimulating the clothing business.' 

Back to haunt them: Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake demonstrate how not to do double denim back in 2001 - but were they just foreseeing the future of fashion? 

Here's how to do it: Kim Kardashian, left, and Miranda Kerr prove that you can pull off double denim and still look stylish 

A-list fans: Kelly Brook, left, and Eva Mendes have recently been seen out trialling the double denim trend

While double denim has been seen as a fashion fail, like wearing socks with sandals (which had a moment this season), it seems fashion houses are keen to change our perception.

This season saw Balmain, Louis Vuitton, and Joseph Altuzarra send out models swathed in denim and judging by Ralph Lauren's latest offering, the Marmite trend shows no sign of abating. 

While Kim Kardashian, Miranda Kerr and Eva Mendes have been trialling the trend, we haven't spotted any stylish male celebrities teaming their favourite jeans with a denim shirt...yet.

Fashion blogger and founder of Want Her Wardrobe, Lydia Jones, said: ‘A few short years ago, wearing double denim was the most uncool thing ever but fashion bloggers and street stylistas changed that and it seems the big fashion houses and even the high street are slowly catching on. 

'If you want to trial the trend but don't want to do a Justin and Britney, try wearing denim dungarees and then add a cropped denim jacket.

'Braver fashion fans can try out a denim shirt tucked loosely into high waisted jeans a la Miranda Kerr.' 

Fresh off the runway: Balmain - the label loved by Miranda Kerr and Kim Kardashian - sent models down the catwalk in Paris covered in denim for SS14 and it looks like the trend will gain momentum for next season
