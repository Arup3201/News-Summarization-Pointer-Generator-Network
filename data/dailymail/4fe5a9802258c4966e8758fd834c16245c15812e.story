Ferocious winds roared through southern California on Thursday, leaving the region covered in thick dust. 

The summer storm, called a haboob, swept through the area, including Palm Springs, with winds up to 40mph. One man was hospitalized at Desert Regional Medical Center with minor injuries after being hit by a fallen tree. 

Road conditions were dangerous as tires kicked up dust leaving drivers with low visibility.  

Trucks kick up dust while driving between farms on Friday near Firebaugh, California after 40mph coated the southern region in dirt and sand

The sky was turned completely dark by the huge cloud of dust and turned conditions at sea rough and choppy.  

One driver, Scott Pam told ABC that a 'huge wall of dust and sand' ripped the door straps off his Jeep. 

Mr Pam, a photographer, managed to snap some shots of the swirling clouds of dust.  

 A haboob comes from an Arabic word which means 'blasting or drafting'. It is used to describe a particularly intense dust storm. 

They are common in specific regions, typically places with dry, arid conditions, from the Middle East to California and across the Southwest. 

A dust storm occurs when cold drives downwards during a thunderstorm formation, blowing loose dust and dirt up from desert areas into the air.

Winds can travel up to 60mph and even turn to mud storms if rain also occurs.
