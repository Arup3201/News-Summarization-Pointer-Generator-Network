John Hayes is to move to Number 10 to act as a 'parliamentary greybeard' for the PM

David Cameron moved to build bridges with his backbenchers yesterday by appointing a right-winger to be his eyes and ears in Parliament.

Energy Minister John Hayes – who has battled with the Lib Dems over windfarms –  become a Cabinet Office Minister.

As Mr Cameron’s senior Parliamentary adviser, Mr Hayes, a flamboyant and popular right-wing veteran, will channel concerns from MPs to the Prime Minister.

It is a role last carried out by Andrew Mackay when the Tories were in opposition.

Mr Hayes’s surprise appointment follows mutterings about a potential Tory leadership challenge and complaints from ministers about an increasingly rebellious Parliamentary party.

His energy responsibilities will pass to Business Minister Michael Fallon, one of the Tories’ toughest ministers.

The move comes on the day the Spectator magazine reported that Cabinet ministers believe 25 MPs have written to Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee demanding a leadership election.

The rebels would need 46 to prompt a vote. Mr Brady refused to comment on the claims.

Mr Hayes’s appointment is an admission that Mr Cameron and his circle of aides have failed to engage productively with a growing section of his party.

Mr Hayes proved a controversial energy minister, when he ruled out any more onshore wind farms, declaring 'enough is enough'

The move is seen as a pre-emptive 
measure by Mr Cameron ahead of difficult local elections in May, where 
the Tories are expected to lose hundreds of council seats to Labour and 
the UK Independence Party.

Allies of backbencher Adam Afriyie 
have been openly advancing his leadership prospects and Home Secretary 
Theresa May is also putting a campaign together in private. Both say 
they would not challenge Mr Cameron, but his aides admit they need to 
raise their game.

The Prime Minister took to Twitter to say he was 'delighted' by the shake up to his team

John Hayes

John Hayes could not be more different to the privileged elite who are said to dominate the upper echelons of the Tory party.

Boxer,
union member, antiques collector, jam maker: he is one of a handful of 
working class, grammar school-educated Conservative ministers in the 
government.

He has strong 
views on almost everything, from gay marriage and most famously wind 
farms to the right way to decorate a Christmas cake. (I just think real 
icing is very important.)

The
son of a power station worker, he grew up on a council estate in south 
east London and is 'very proud' of his working class roots.

In
Who's Who he lists his interests as: 'The arts (particularly English 
painting, poetry and prose), good food and wine, many sports (including 
darts and boxing), gardening, making jam, antiques, architecture, 
aesthetics.'

A former county councillor in Nottinghamshire, he was elected as MP for South Holland and the Deepings in Lincolnshire in 1997.

Within
two years William Hague appointed him as vice-chairman of the Tory 
party, responsible for campaigning before becoming shadow schools 
minister in 2000 and served on the opposition frontbench for Iain Duncan
Smith, for whom he was once a speech writer, Michael Howard and later 
David Cameron.

However, he was also an outspoken critic of Mr Cameron's style in the early days of the leadership.

In
2006 he dismissed plans for an A-list of high-flying Tory candidates 'a
bizarre theory of people who spend too much time with the pseuds and 
posers of London's chi-chi set and not enough time in normal Britain'.

He is chairman of the Cornerstone Group of traditional conservatives, whose motto is 'faith, flag and family'.

His
rise through the political ranks passed almost unnoticed until last 
year he declared war on wind farms, and gained a reputation for speaking
for many Tory backbenchers who felt Downing Street was not listening to
their concerns.

‘Do we want to strengthen our 
relations with the Parliamentary party? Of course we do,’ said a Downing
Street source. ‘John’s going to be a massive asset.’

Mr Hayes is a founder member of the 
Cornerstone Group of socially conservative Tories and will be expected 
to calm anger on that wing of the party about Mr Cameron’s support for 
gay marriage.

Whether he can also get Eurosceptics and Thatcherites demanding tax cuts back on board remains to be seen.

One minister who is close to Mr 
Cameron said of Mr Hayes: ‘We’ve needed someone like that for a long 
time. John reaches parts of the party that others do not reach. It shows
the PM is aware that he needs to do more to keep MPs in the loop.’

Mr Hayes becomes a minister of state 
without portfolio in the Cabinet Office and has been appointed to the 
Privy Council. But some MPs said it will take more than his appointment 
to repair relations with the party.

■The Tories would be neck and neck with Labour if Boris Johnson replaced Mr Cameron as leader, a poll revealed.

The YouGov survey put Labour’s lead 
at six points, on 37 per cent to the Tories’ 31. But when voters are 
asked how they would vote if the Mayor of London was Tory leader, the 
parties are tied on 37 per cent. Crucially, a Boris leadership would 
lure a third of UKIP voters to the Tories.

Business minister Michael Fallon adds energy to his brief

Michael Fallon has been brought in to give the Energy Department a ‘business mindset’ and calm tensions about wind farms and rising fuel bills.

Anti-turbine campaigners will be cheered by his remarks yesterday that he would concentrate on nuclear power, oil, gas, and offshore wind.

But he failed to mention the controversial topic of onshore windfarms. Party sources understand he is ‘very aware’ of concerns about the impact of turbines on the landscape.

They say that, while he will back the growth of green industries, he will take a ‘very robust’ approach to attempts to overburden other sectors of the economy with environmental taxes and rules.

Mr Fallon, a rising star of the Conservative party, is renowned for driving projects through. His brief is to help the Energy and Climate Change Department attract the £110billion of private sector investment it desperately needs for new energy generation, particularly in nuclear power stations.

Fears are growing that failure to do so could see further increases in electricity bills and even blackouts.

There are tensions between his new boss, Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey, who wants to build up the renewable energy sector, and the Treasury which says this would burden other sectors with green taxes and regulations.

Mr Fallon has been urged to stand up to Liberal Democrats and EU ministers who want to increase the target for the amount of energy which must come from ‘green’ sources – currently 15 per cent by 2020.

Mr Fallon will retain his role as a business minister.
