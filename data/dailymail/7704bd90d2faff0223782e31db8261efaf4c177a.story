Coronation Street bosses have recast the role of Bethany Platt.

Producers of the ITV soap axed 25-year-old actress Katie Redford last week after it emerged she'd lied about her age, pretending to be 19  so she could play the 14-year-old daughter of returning character Sarah Louise Platt (Tina O'Brien).

Lucy Fallon from Blackpool, who is actually 19, will start filming scenes this week, just days after landing her first ever TV role on the Manchester based drama.

Welcome to the family: Lucy Fallon can be seen alongside her  co-stars Helen Worth and Jack P. Shepherd in the first shot of the young actress in character as Bethany Platt

The blonde can be seen posing in the Platt household alongside her on-screen grandmother Gail (Helen Worth) and uncle David (Jack P. Shepherd) in a first-look photo of her character.

Lucy said: 'Walking onto the set was surreal and nerve wracking but everyone has been really welcoming and I am thrilled to have been given this opportunity.'

Teenage tearaway Bethany is set to return to the Weatherfield cobbles later this year.

The character was last seen as a seven-year-old in 2007 when she moved after to Italy with young mum Sarah to start a new life.

Lucy will make her first appearance as Bethany in late March when she returns to the street after fleeing Milan following a row with her mum.

Despite being determined to drag her daughter back to Italy, Tina will be persuaded to stay in Weatherfield by her family.

Corrie fans revealed the truth about Katie's age after discovering an old CV for the actress online, on which her date of birth is listed as March 2, 1989.

However, her agent jumped to her defence claiming they'd advised her to lie if questioned as her CV states her playing age is 16-20.

They shared: 'We said, "If they ask, let them believe you are 19" ... People do it all the time.' 

Producers decided to axe original choice Katie Redford because at the age of 25, she was just two years younger than her on-screen mother, played by Tina O'Brien. 

Soap fans unearthed a variety of evidence which reveals the actress's real age after ITV announced that  'Nottingham-born Katie, 19' would be playing the young character.

A former online CV for the actress listed her date of birth as 2 March 1989 and her Twitter username has changed from 'katieredford89' to 'Katieredfordtlc'

Public records also show that Ms Redford's date of birth is 2 March 1989 - meaning she would be 12 years older than the character in two months time.

Fan Dave Harrison said: 'On her Twitter account there were pictures of the actress at her 25th birthday last year.' 

Cal tweeted: 'Why are all the press releases for the new Bethany casting saying Katie Redford is 19? She's 25 as she was born in 1989. #Corrie'

Megan said: 'It's hilarious how ITV are desperately trying to remove all traces of Katie Redford's real age from the internet.'

The actress's agent Jo McLintock revealed that ITV was not aware of her age and said Ms Redford was 'understandably' upset today.

She said: 'Katie went in there acting as a young actress with a playing age of 16-20. ITV did not know her age. We were at fault as we let her go in there without the producers knowing her age.

'She is being re-cast and casting was adamant that they would not be using us again unfortunately.

'She is a brilliant young actress and very talented. We ill-advised her, but she just went in there and acted much younger than her age. Understandably she is very upset today.'

Ms Redford trained with The National Youth Theatre and was nominated for Best Actress in award winning film, Pitfall at The Underwire Film Festival. 

The character of Bethany was previously played by three child actors - Mia Cookson and twins Amy and Emily Walton.

Producer Stuart Blackburn said: 'Full of mischief and with a real lust for life Bethany is an unpredictable force of nature who will bring joy and chaos in equal measure, turning their household upside down.

'Life has just got a lot more interesting for The Platts and anyone who crosses Bethany's path.' 

A spokesman for ITV confirmed last week: 'Coronation Street have taken the decision to recast the part of Bethany Platt.'
