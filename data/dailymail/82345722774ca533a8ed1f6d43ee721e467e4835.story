A former mayor and her daughter have been banned from owning animals after they kept almost 70 pets in squalid conditions at their home.

Pamela Ann Crisp-Beard, 63, and her daughter Maria, 24, kept a menagerie at their cramped semi-detached property in Horncastle, Lincolnshire.

Their pets included 15 rabbits, a golden pheasant, two guinea pigs, five mice, two rats, a cat, two dogs, four domestic ducks, a goose and 22 chickens, a parrot and two ferrets.

Neighbours contacted the RSPCA in January last year over concerns about the animals and officers discovered they were living in appalling conditions.

Their home was in such a state that welfare officers said it was ‘knee-deep’ in faeces. The duo were found guilty of six animal welfare charges at Skegness Magistrates' Court in December last year.

Yesterday they were banned from keeping animals for life and given an 18-month conditional discharge at the same court.

Pamela Crisp-Beard - who was Mayor of Horncastle between May 1997 and May 1998 - was also ordered to pay £10,000 towards the costs of the RSPCA prosecution.

Conditional discharge: The duo were found guilty of animal welfare charges at Skegness Magistrates' Court

Magistrates said they took into account that the offences were caused by ‘neglect rather than downright cruelty’ after the pair told the court they loved their pets.

Pamela Crisp-Beard, who also served as a councillor between 2003 and 2011, told the court: ‘We love our animals. We always have done. All we have tried to do is look after them.’

The court heard the pair kept some of their animals indoors, including in a bedroom, at their home, while others were left in the back garden.

RSPCA inspector Deborah Scotcher told the court when she visited the house her feet squelched on the hall carpets because they were sodden with urine.

Last straw: Shockingly, the rabbits had become so desperate to escape they had ‘created a network of tunnels’ through knee deep compacted faeces

She gave the pair three days to improve the situation but when she returned there was no improvement.

So the inspector came back a third time with two police officers and a vet on January 29 last year, and took the animals away.

Pamela Crisp-Beard also pleaded guilty to two further charges of having a dog dangerously out of control in a public place.

Jim Clare, prosecuting, said the first offence took place when a man was walking his poodle which was attacked by a lurcher-type dog owned by the Crisp-Beards.

He added: ‘The lurcher had sunk its teeth into the poodle which was yelping and defenceless.’

The second incident involved a 13-year-old daschund which was also attacked by the lurcher while Pamela Crisp-Beard walked her two dogs.

For these offences she was also given an 18-month conditional discharge and will also have to pay vet costs of £330 and a victim surcharge of £15.

Ruth Harrop, defending, said both mother and daughter had suffered from mental and physical distress because of the case. She added: ‘Their inability to cope was neglect rather than cruelty.

‘They struggled to cope because of the sheer number of animals, many of which had been handed to them as rescues. They were not just pets but family members.’
