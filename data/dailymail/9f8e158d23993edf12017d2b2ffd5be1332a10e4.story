Probe: One woman died and another is fighting for her life after an incident in Phoenix Boulevard

The alleged attack was reported to the police at 7.55pm last night by the ambulance service.

Police activity centred this morning on a block of six privately owned flats, it was reported.

Ian Clancy, 52, who lives in a nearby flat, said his partner heard 'a lot of banging' at 7.50pm yesterday just before paramedics arrived.

He told the York Press: 'Minutes later, police turned up and I knew it was something really bad going on because I have never seen so many police.

'Then a good half hour to 40 minutes later I saw a girl coming out on a stretcher, she didn't look good.'

Ursula Simpson, vicar at St Barnabas Church, and her husband Roger had just spent the first night in their new home in Phoenix Boulevard after moving in yesterday.

She said: 'I went off early to the gym this morning and saw all these police vehicles here and wondered what was going on. You never know what it might be so I came back and was told it was murder.'

Detective Superintendent Heather Pearson, from North Yorkshire Police, appealed to the public for information, saying: 'Although we have made an arrest in this case, if you have any information about the incident on Phoenix Boulevard, I urge you to come forward immediately, as you may have vital details that could help the investigation.'
