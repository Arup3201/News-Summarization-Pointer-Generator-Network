A retired computer analyst was murdered as he tidied his garage while his wife was in their house feet away.

Father-of-two Leonard Flower, 67, is thought to have been attacked after popping out for a cigarette.

His wife, Linda, did not know her husband had been killed until a woman delivering flyers spotted him lying in the garage in Luton at about 2pm yesterday.

Father-of-two Leonard Flower was murdered in the garage of his Luton home on Tuesday

Detectives said he was 'violently and savagely' set upon in an 'unprovoked attack'

Armed police and search dogs were sent to the scene and they broke down the door of a nearby house.

Mr Flower was pronounced dead at the scene.

A 35-year-old man, named locally as Sameer Babar, was arrested five hours later and 70 miles away in Warwickshire.

One neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'Len was a right smoker, but Linda didn’t like it so he’d have a cheeky cigarette in the garage.

'It’s probably what he was doing at the time. As soon as the first police car turned up armed response were here within minutes.

'Sameer Babar lived opposite them.'

He paid tribute to Mr Flower and said he was a 'great guy', adding: 'It’s just tragic what happened.'

Police said Mr Flower was tidying his garage when he attacked. He was pronounced dead at the scene

The murder suspect was arrested in Warwickshire at 7pm on Tuesday and is now being questioned at Luton police station.

Detective Chief Inspector Jason Gordon, from Bedfordshire Police, said: 'This is a violent incident that has left a family and community in total shock.

'Our deepest sympathies are with his wife and daughters and all who knew Mr Flower.

'The victim was at home tidying his garage when he was violently and savagely set upon in an unprovoked attack.

'While we have a man in custody, it is very important that anyone who has information about the incident comes forward and speaks to the police.

Mr Flower's wife did not realise her husband was injured until a passerby alerted her while delivering flyers

Neighbours said Mr Babar lived opposite the home of Mr and Mrs Flower, who were retired

'We need to build a picture of what led to this murder and why he came to be a victim in this horrific event. Our deepest sympathies are with his family at this time.'

A Bedfordshire Police spokesman said: 'He was found by a member of the public who was delivering leaflets in the area a short time after the attack occurred and although the emergency services attended immediately he was pronounced dead at the scene.

'The victim’s wife, who was in the house at the time of the incident, was unaware of what had happened until the police and paramedics arrived.'
