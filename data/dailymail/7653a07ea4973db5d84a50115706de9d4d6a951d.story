Victim: Melissa Bonney Ratcliff, 45, a one-time aide to former Vice President Al Gore, has been killed by an elderly motorist's out-of-control car in San Diego

Melissa Bonney Ratcliff, a one-time aide to Vice President Al Gore, has been killed by an elderly motorist's out-of-control car in San Diego.

The coroner's office says the 45-year-old Ratcliff was struck by the Sedan, being driven by a 91-year-old woman, Tuesday afternoon as she got out of her vehicle in the La Jolla area.

From 1999 to 2000, mother-of-three Ratcliff was deputy director of communications for Gore. 

She was also a press secretary for the Democratic National Committee.

U-T San Diego reports  that Gore issued a statement saying Ratcliff was an integral part of the White House team.

He said: 'Melissa was an integral part of our team in the White House. A loyal and dedicated colleague, her counsel, foresight and determination were indispensable. All of us who who worked with Melissa send condolences to her family.'

A San Diego police spokesman told the newspaper the accident is under investigation but the driver could face vehicular manslaughter charges.

Mrs Ratcliff was also an executive with the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce. 

Jerry Sanders, the chamber president and chief executive officer, sent an email to chamber members today expressing 'great sadness' over Ratcliff's death.

'Melissa was a well-respected and valued member of the Chamber team and will be missed by all of us,' Sanders wrote. 'We are all deeply saddened by her loss and send our thoughts and prayers to her family and friends.'

According to her LinkedIn profile, Radcliff worked as a strategic communications consultant for 11 years and served as director of communications for the Broad Foundation before working for Gore.

She was press secretary for the Democratic National Committee from 1997 to 1999 and was the DNC spokesperson during campaign finance and the Monica Lewinsky scandals.

Family: The mother-of-three, who was an executive with the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce, lived in La Jolla, San Diego, with her three children
