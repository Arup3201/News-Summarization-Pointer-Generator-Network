Question: Councillor and father David Scott has told of his frustration at the deepening political fallout

The father whose question led to Lord Freud’s remarks suggesting some disabled workers were ‘not worth’ the minimum wage told yesterday of his frustration at the deepening political fallout.

David Scott said his exchange with the Welfare Minister at the Conservative Party conference last month had been taken out of context as he spoke movingly of the inspirational life of his severely disabled daughter Moira, who died six years ago.

Meanwhile Nick Clegg added to the criticism of Lord Freud’s comments, while Labour renewed calls for the minister to explain himself.

Mr Scott, 63, a Tory councillor for Tunbridge Wells in Kent, asked Lord Freud a question about getting the disabled into work during a fringe meeting at the Tory conference.

In his response Lord Freud said: ‘There is a group, and I know exactly who you mean, where actually as you say they’re not worth the full wage and actually I’m going to go and think about that particular issue, whether there is something we can do nationally, and without distorting the whole thing, which actually if someone wants to work for £2 an hour, and it’s working can we actually…’

The minister’s response was seized on by Ed Miliband on Wednesday, when he read out a transcript of the exchange in Prime Minister’s Questions.

Mr Scott suggested he was more concerned with getting across his own message than the political row, saying: ‘Major politicians can look after themselves.’

He said he wanted to find ways of better integrating disabled people into society – including paying them for work in addition to the benefits they receive.

Severely disabled: Mr Scott, 63, spoke movingly of the inspirational life of his late daughter Moira (above)

‘My main concern is how to enhance the lives of severely disabled people and get support for them in the community,’ he continued. ‘Community means not just at home or in shops, but at the workplace and everywhere else.

‘What I’m talking about is finding some way of bringing severely disabled people into the workplace because it can make them feel valued and enhance the lives of those they’re working with. And that feeling of value has nothing to do with money.

Many disabled people are helped into work by a government organisation called Remploy, which tries to match them with suitable jobs.

It was set up in 1944 by the then Minister for Labour Ernest Bevin, and two years later opened its first factory at Bridgend in South Wales.

Many of its workers, who made items such as furniture, were disabled ex-miners. But as the factory network grew it also employed soldiers returning from the Second World War.

At its peak in the late 1980s, the factories employed more than 10,000 people. The Government subsidised each job to the tune of £27,000 a year.

But state funding was gradually withdrawn because of the growing view that disabled people should be helped to find mainstream jobs, and the factories were closed.

Employment Minister Esther McVey announced earlier this year that Remploy – which now helps disabled people into work through placement schemes – was to be privatised.

‘When someone goes out to work, whether they are disabled or not, they benefit greatly from that. They benefit from doing something, from interacting with people.’

He added: ‘I want severely learning disabled people to have their value recognised, which will include money over and above the benefits they need to live.’

Mr Scott said Moira, who had brain damage, was blind, could not talk and used a wheelchair, was too severely disabled to work. But many of her other experiences had shown him disabled people should be given as many opportunities as possible.

With the help of a charity, Mr Scott and his wife Jillian, also 63, were able to arrange for Moira to live in a specially adapted house near their own home, where she lived with housemates as well as her carers.

And in the last year of her life she had the chance to groom and feed horses at a nearby stables.

Mr Scott said: ‘It’s about giving people a level of independence and involvement so they can say, “I am living my life” rather than life being done to them.

‘So many parents of the severely disabled feel that. They want their child to be treated as a valued human being.’

Mr Clegg said Lord Freud’s comments had ‘caused huge offence’. But he told LBC radio: ‘That shouldn’t stop any of us having a discussion and, frankly, a difficult discussion, to get more people with disabilities and with other disadvantages in life into the workplace.’

Charity Mencap, which has led criticism of Lord Freud, once said the minimum wage had jeopardised jobs for 1,000 disabled people, it emerged yesterday.

In 2000, the charity said: ‘The minimum wage has helped many people with learning disabilities. But people who have severe learning disabilities are also employed, even though they may have a productivity rate of 30 per cent of the average.

‘An employer may say that they will pay someone £15 a week for doing 15 hours work... Unfortunately, if employers have to pay the minimum wage, they may have to let these valuable members of their staff go.’

A Mencap spokesman said: ‘In the last 15 years, the system to support disabled people into work has been transformed and debate has moved on, as has our position on this issue.’

A father said his disabled son would be ‘over the moon’ to work for less than the minimum wage - because he would take ‘three times as long’ as another employee to do the job.

Julian Mason said his son Ben, 32, who has learning difficulties caused by the genetic condition Fragile X syndrome, would be happy to be paid £2 an hour to stack shelves in a supermarket.

On BBC Radio 5 Live yesterday, the retired engineer, 69, said his son ‘would need fairly constant supervision’ as he struggles with concentration, but that he gets a ‘profound sense of achievement’ from working.

‘If Ben was receiving a wage packet ... of say, £2 an hour, he would just be over the moon,’ he added.

Mr Mason, from Darley Bridge, Derbyshire, said it would not be right to pay all disabled people less – but for those who require supervision it could be fair.
