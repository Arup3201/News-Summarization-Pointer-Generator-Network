Trumped up criminal charges, bad press - it's all part of a scheme to get him out of office, New York Congressman Michael Grimm says.

'There’s no question: I’ve been vilified by the press since the day I got here,' Grimm told Politico in an interview. 'From the very beginning they had to figure out how to get rid of this guy.'

Grimm accused the media of focusing on 'ridiculous nonsense,' but the former Marine and Federal Bureau of Investigation agent would not say he was innocent of the charges filed against him by the federal government.

'You know, uh. It depends on what you’re asking me of,' he said.

The only thing Grimm said he was 'guilty' of was being a good congressman

'[My constituents] are behind me now more than ever, because I get results,' Grimm said in a recent interview

In April Grimm was indicted in Federal Court on 20 counts of criminal charges, including wire fraud, mail fraud, conspiring to defraud the U.S., impeding the IRS, hiring and employing unauthorized aliens and health care fraud.

Prosecutors say Grimm underreported more than $1 million in sales and wages for workers at a healthy food restaurant he owned before he was elected to Congress in 2010 and lied about it in a deposition.

The restauranteur reportedly paid legal and illegal employees of eatery Healthalicious under the table so he could avoid paying taxes on the restaurant's revenue.

At his hearing this month, Grimm pleaded not guilty to the charges and was released on $400,000 bond.

He has claimed prosecutors were trying to 'assassinate my character' by leaking 'all kinds of innuendos and accusations to support a political witch hunt.'

'I know I'm a moral man, a man of integrity,' he said. 'And I also know I have a lot more service and leadership to provide this country, and that's exactly what I intend to do.'

'I'm going to fight tooth and nail until I am exonerated.'

Meanwhile, prosecutors say they have thousands of emails proving Grimm is guilty.

'Rep. Grimm billed himself as a patriot and an American hero,' George Venizelos, head of the FBI's New York office, said. 'But Rep. Grimm was anything but an upstanding citizen. He cheated, evaded and then lied.'

The federal charges filed against Grimm last month may not be the last of the Congressman's legal woes. Feds indicated at Grimm's hearing that they may add charges to Grimm's docket.

The Staten Island congressman was originally under suspicion of violating campaign fiance laws. The government believed Grimm received illegal, overseas contributions during his first congressional race.

An ex-girlfriend of the congressman's, Diana Durand, has been indicted on charges in that investigation. She allegedly used straw donors to funnel the money to Grimm's campaign, the FBI says.

Grimm is 
also under investigation by the House Ethics committee. That 
investigation is currently on hold, however, at the request of the 
Department on Justice.

When asked
 about the federal investigation by local news reporter Michael Scotto in January, 
Grimm told him, 'If you ever do that to me again, I'll throw you off this f****** balcony.'

The Congressman admitted to Politico that the media wasn't responsible for the political storm that followed the confrontation.

'My misstep with Michael Scotto, that’s on me,' Grimm said. 'I screwed up.'

Grimm said he just felt like the interview was more 'nonsense' and the question was a 'cheap shop.'

The two-term Congressman has blamed the media throughout his legal drama for making more hay than necessary out of his troubles.

'Look, I’ll sum it up. What do I think 
of the press? I think, right now, and it’s been this way for two years: 
If I pass a burning building, and I stop and I run in and I save a baby,
 you know what the headline will be? "Grimm starts the fire," ' he 
claimed. 'That’s just the reality.'

'Bad boy' of Congress? Not all, Grimm says. He's only aggressive because he tired of his constituents getting 'screwed'

Grimm said reports that he's the 'bad
 boy' of Congress are ridiculous. He said he's merely trying to make 
sure his congressional district gets its fair share.

'I don’t care what the 
papers write, ' Grimm told Politico, 'I’m aggressive, quite frankly, because Staten Island gets 
screwed all the time.'

'And if I’m not aggressive, then I won’t be 
successful,' he said.

'That’s not being a bad boy. That’s doing my job.'

Grimm went on to say in the interview that his 'style, granted, is to break eggs, to step on toes.'

'I didn’t take this job to make a political future or career,' he continued.

The New York City Congressman 
maintains that the government's allegations about his business are a way
 to nail him in lieu of the campaign finance violations they've been 
unable to make stick legally.

He's refused to vacate his Congressional seat and is running for reelection because he is so confident he won't end up doing time.

Earlier this week his campaign manager quit, so Grimm decided to run his own political operation.

He told Politico he would spend his time meeting with 'friends and family' rather than running a traditional  political campaign. That's all he needs to do get re-elected, he insisted.

'[My constituents] are behind me now more than ever, because I get results,' Grimm said.

'And yet the press focuses on the most ridiculous nonsense that I can dream about.'

After 
hedging on the question of his innocence of criminal wrongdoing, Grimm said there's only one thing he'll admit he's guilty of: being a good Congressman.

'What I’m guilty 
of is trying the hardest and giving 100 percent of myself and putting my
 heart and soul into representing the people of Staten Island and 
Brooklyn.'
