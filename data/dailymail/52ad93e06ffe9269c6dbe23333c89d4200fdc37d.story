An advocacy group has released images which claim to show an NYPD officer putting a seven-months pregnant woman into a chokehold for illegally grilling on the sidewalk in front of her apartment.

NYPD officers have been banned from using the chokehold since 1993, but an officer can be seen in the pictures wrapping his arm around 27-year-old Rosan Miller's neck in the Saturday incident.

Her young daughter is also in the pictures, watching the arrest unfold. The NYPD told MailOnline that it is currently investigating the incident.

Rosan was given a summons for disorderly conduct.

When former city councilman Charles Barron heard about the incident, he called the police department to complain and expedite the Miller family's release.

'This was all over a grill,' Barron told the New York Daily News. 'This is about grilling in front of her house.'

Calls to Mrs Miller's apartment were not returned Monday afternoon.
