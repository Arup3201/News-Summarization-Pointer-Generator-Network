The cast of Broadway's Aladdin paid a special tribute to Robin Williams with a singalong to Friend Like Me as theatres dimmed their lights for one minute.

Williams was the voice of the Genie in Disney's Aladdin released in 1992.

James Monroe Iglehart, who won a Tony Award for playing the Genie in the theatre version, led the audience at the New Amsterdam Theatre after the curtain went down.

The song Friend Like Me is sung by the Genie to Aladdin in the film and musical.

Everyone in the audience was encouraged to sing along and words to the tune had been stuffed into programmes before the show.

Inglehart told the audience: 'We've lost not just one of the greatest comedians but one of the greatest entertainers of all time.

'So I want us to sing a little bit of Friend Like Me before we go.'

The singalong came as theatres across Great White Way dimmed their lights in solemn tribute to the star.

A photo of the actor was also projected on a large screen above the Imperial and Music Box theaters.

The actor became well known for his screen work but had several hit performances on the stage.

Theatergoers
 reveled in his performance alongside Steve Martin in Waiting for Godot 
in 1988 and more recently in Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo in 2011.

Williams appeared in a one man show, Robin Williams: Live on Broadway, in 2002.

Those in stage and screen were equally shocked by his suicide on Monday.

The exact nature of his death has become a controversial point in the tragedy as San Francisco Bay area sheriffs spoke out on Wednesday in defense of their decision to reveal exactly how the actor completed the sad act and what his body looked like thereafter.

Marin County Sheriff's Lt. Keith Boyd said in an email that the agency would have liked to withhold some of the information, but could not under the California Public Records Act.

'These kinds of cases, whether they garner national attention or not, are very difficult for everyone involved,' Boyd said.

'Frankly, it would have been our personal preference to withhold a lot of what we disclosed to the press yesterday, but the California Public Records Act does not give us that kind of latitude.'

Boyd announced during a live, televised 
news conference Tuesday that Williams committed suicide by hanging 
himself.

He described in detail how Williams carried out the suicide and
 the condition of the body.

Some people criticised the level of detail, 
and experts in suicide prevention said the information could influence 
those considering suicide to try the same thing.

'Having that amount of detail is not helpful' said Lyn Morris, vice president of clinical operations at Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services, which runs the main suicide prevention hotline in Southern California. 'The contagion effect is real, and it's worrisome.'

Boyd said the sheriff's office is discussing with the county's attorney possible exemptions to the public record's act that would allow it to withhold the 911 call it received from Williams' home and fire dispatch tapes.

But Boyd said the agency would likely have to release them within ten days, as required by law.

Free speech groups defended the disclosures as appropriate and said the law enforcement agency was responding to a crush of a requests for information required to be disclosed.

'Coroners are not required to provide details by press conference,' said Terry Francke, head of open government group Californians Aware.

But he said the Marin County Sheriff's Department chose to disseminate as much information as quickly possible at one time rather than leak piecemeal.

Some three dozen television cameras and twice as many reporters from around the globe crowded the news conference outside the sheriff's offices on Tuesday morning.

'While the impact of the details on some people's mourning of Mr. Williams' passing may have been jarring, keeping what was known under wraps would have added needless speculation if not suspicion to the general shock,' Francke said.Â
