England's final World Cup warm-up game against Honduras was postponed after just 22 minutes due to an electrical storm in Miami.

The players were ordered off the pitch at the Sun Life Stadium as stormy clouds appeared over the venue. Fans were also urged to move out of the stadium.

A message displayed on the big screen read: ‘Due to inclement weather, with associated lightning, feel free to exit the seating bowl and move to the inner concourse.’

The players went to the sidelines for what appeared to be a drinks break, only to be called over by referee Ricardo Salazar who informed them of his decision to impose a 30-minute match suspension.

Both teams re-emerged at 5.44pm local time - 36 minutes after they began leaving the field - for a warm-up, with the scoreboard announcing play would resume at 5.51pm. The match restarted shortly afterwards with a Honduras goal-kick.

The players had begun playing in temperatures of 31 degrees Celsius and 59 per cent humidity - almost identical to the conditions in Manaus, where England's World Cup campaign starts in seven days.

Speaking to ITV after leading his players down the tunnel, England boss Roy Hodgson said: ‘It’s a surprise. You don’t come across this very often.

‘I’ve encountered this on the golf course and you don’t continue if there is a storm around.

‘We can only accept and appreciate the referee’s decision. All we can do is wait for the 30 minutes.’

The Three Lions are due to depart for Brazil at 10.30pm local time and Hodgson was confident that the delay will not affect their plans.

He added: ‘It’s a private plane so I would like to think we will be okay.’

Hodgson's men kept possession well in the early stages, perhaps in preparation for the style they will need to play against Italy next Saturday.

Danny Welbeck managed the first shot of the day with just four minutes on the clock, stinging the palms of Noel Valladares but getting a knock for his troubles.

The Manchester United attacker eventually stopped limping but the sight was a concern - much like Glen Johnson's early defensive play.

Back in the side after James Milner played makeshift right-back against Ecuador, first his clumsy touch gave away a corner from which Victor Bernardez blazed over and then he was unable to prevent Carlo Costly clipping over a cross.

They were, however, rare nervy moments for England returned to the attack, with Steven Gerrard skewing a strike wide before Valladares somehow spilled a 30-yard Wayne Rooney free-kick.

A loud crack of thunder rang around the ground as Rooney overran a ball, before he linked-up with United team-mate Welbeck to set-up England's best chance yet.

The latter played the ball out wide to Rooney, whose ball back across was met by a neat stepover by Welbeck, allowing Sturridge to spin and strike a left-footed shot inches wide.

That was the best moment of the match and the last before the unforeseen break in play.
