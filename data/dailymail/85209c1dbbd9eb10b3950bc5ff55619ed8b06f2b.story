This time last year, all was well at Anfield. Liverpool were a point ahead of Manchester City at the top of the Barclays Premier League and Brendan Rodgers was looking good for the manager of the year award. 

Steven Gerrard was on his game, feeding Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge with those measured passes through midfield. But the landscape has changed drastically as Liverpool prepare to face Arsenal at home on Sunday.

‘Everyone knows if we perform the way we have done of late against Arsenal we’ll get beaten,’ admitted Gerrard. ‘When you have a strikeforce of Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez, they are capable of killing teams in 20 minutes. It’s different this year and everyone knows that.’

Liverpool lie in 11th place, 18 points behind leaders Chelsea, who they have been drawn to face in the Capital One Cup semi-final.

Even in the moments after Liverpool reached the last four with a 3-1 win at Bournemouth on Wednesday night, captain Gerrard was on hand for a rather brutal reality check.

Last season they blew Arsenal away at Anfield, scoring four times in the opening 20 minutes and eventually winning 5-1.

This is a different Liverpool team, still adapting to life without Suarez and the injured Sturridge, who has been forced to go to Boston for treatment on his troublesome thigh injury.

‘I think they were 60-70 per cent of our goals those two. You take them out of any team in the world and it’s going to be tough and it has been,’ said Gerrard. ‘But I think this is where you find out what kind of players you’ve got in the dressing room. It’s time to roll your sleeves up and fight for the club and try to put it right as soon as possible and that’s what we’re trying to do.

‘We made mistakes against Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday and we got punished by world-class players,’ he added. ‘The first half against Bournemouth was probably as close as we’ve come to last season’s standards.

‘It’s been tough to perform of late because we haven’t played well as a team, but if we keep giving everything we’ve got then I’m sure the good days are not too far away.

‘If we can get a big result against Arsenal and build on this, then I think we can turn it around.’

Gerrard does not agree that they have turned the corner after beating a Championship team. The pressure is still on and so it should be after seven league defeats and an unnecessary exit in the group stage of the Champions League.

The scrutiny has been intense and Gerrard accused people of ‘killing’ the club during a wretched run. He made it clear that the criticism of his own performances hurts him, but accepts that is the life as a player or manager at one of the world’s biggest clubs.

Brendan Rodgers has to accept criticism will come his way as manager of Liverpool, says Gerrard

‘It comes with the territory,’ he said. ‘There was a stage when a couple of my performances were under par and I got a bit of stick. It’s normal. I’ve got to accept it being captain of the club and Brendan’s got to accept it being the manager of Liverpool.

‘If results don’t go well, questions are going to be asked, criticism is going to fly, you take it on the chin and try to improve things. That’s the only way. I know when I don’t play well. I think every individual does, but collectively it has been tough.

‘For me I’ve experienced it a few times during my career at Liverpool when it gets tough under certain managers and from the outside people are trying to kill you. It’s normal. We’re at a big club, we’ve got to take that responsibility. We can’t have players hiding, we need men out there.’

In many ways this was Gerrard at his best, rallying the team and reminding them publicly of their responsibilities to the club. But with Liverpool seven points behind West Ham in fourth place, Champions League qualification appears a tall order for this team.

Gerrard said: ‘It’s a tough question and it’s going to be tough to do it. We knew it was going to be tough the moment we lost Luis and the injuries we’ve had to Daniel of late. Everyone in the country knows the job to get in the top four becomes that awful lot harder. But we’ll keep fighting until the end and if people are going to write us off, we can’t control it.

‘I tell players individually and I tell them in the dressing room. But if you’re sitting in that dressing room and you don’t know that the performance levels haven’t been good enough of late, you’re at the wrong place.

‘All I can control is what goes on in the dressing room and try to help other players to perform well. But certainly, on the performance against Bournemouth, there’s still a chance.’
