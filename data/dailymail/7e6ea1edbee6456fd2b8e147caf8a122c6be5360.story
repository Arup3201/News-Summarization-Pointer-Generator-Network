Claims: Tory MP  Mark Simmonds has been sponsoring his local hospital radio station and claiming it back on expenses

A Tory MP quitting Westminster because £67,000-a-year is not enough to support his family has been sponsoring his local hospital radio station and claiming it back on expenses, it was revealed today. 

Former foreign office minister Mark Simmonds also has an advertisement board behind the goal at Boston United's football ground funded by the taxpayer.

Mr Simmonds, who represents Boston and Skegness in Lincolnshire until May, is leaving Parliament because expenses are not sufficient to allow his young family to live with him in London.

In the 2013/14 financial year he claimed 170,841.21 in expenses, which included £10,000 for his sports advertising at Boston United and elsewhere.

Within his office costs he claimed for the £100 cost of sponsoring his local hospital radio station. 

He also employs his wife Lizbeth as office manager on around £25,000-a-year paid for by the taxpayer. 

For eight years patients and staff at Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, Lincolnshire, have heard that music shows on Fridays are 'kindly sponsored' by Tory Mark Simmonds.

Mr Simmonds, a former Foreign Office minister, says all the expense claims were within the rules and the Boston United board was approved by watchdog Ipsa in advance of the claim. 

Ipsa has also rejected a complaint about sponsorship and refused to investigate because of a lack of 'sufficient evidence'.

Local councillor Robin Hunter-Clarke, who is standing for UKIP in Boston and Skegness in May, told the Daily Mirror: 'To pretend he is sponsoring a hospital radio show, boasting of his generosity while in fact charging the taxpayer, is pretty low.'

Local support: Mr Simmonds has paid for an ad board at Boston United's York Street stadium to allow the public to see his contact details

But the MP has said he cannot understand why his claims are controversial.

He told MailOnline: 'It is a load of nonsense. All the expenses were properly claimed and approved by Ipsa. I even emailed them pictures of the advertising board before I claimed and they approved it.

'It has been a good way to advertise my contact details and a lot of people have got in contact through this'.

Regular sponsor: The MP has for eight years 'kindly sponsored' the Friday music show at Pilgrim Hospital in Boston

Last August he quit because of ‘intolerable’ expenses rules but is the owner of a million-pound mansion, bought using profits from the sale of his taxpayer-funded home.

The 50-year-old already owns a seven-bedroom grade-II listed house with a heated swimming pool. 

Mr Simmonds has claimed more than £1.7million in expenses since becoming a Tory MP in 2001. He also made more than £500,000 by selling a house on which the taxpayer paid the mortgage interest.

Six months after becoming an MP, he bought a five-bedroom house in Putney, south-west London, for £650,000. From 2001 to 2009, he claimed £2,000 a month for the mortgage interest.

When expenses rules were changed to ban such claims, he sold the property in January 2011 for £1,187,500 – £537,000 more than he paid.

Couple:Mr Simmonds also pays the salary of his his wife Lizbeth in her role as his office manager, but he says he will leave Parliament at the election because he rarely sees his three children

The same month, he used the massive profit to help buy the 17th-century property in his constituency for £900,000. Set in 15 acres, it has formal gardens, a garage for three cars, a tennis court and a heated outdoor swimming pool.

But Mr Simmonds said he will leave Parliament at the election because he rarely sees his three children, who live in his constituency. 

He said at the time his expenses ‘do not stretch to renting a flat near Westminster large enough for my children, so I stay in a hotel. I hate it’.

When asked how a rental allowance of £27,875 a year plus £2,500 for each child was not enough, he said: ‘If MPs want to get into the business of travelling extensively from Westminster to the outer reaches of London to rent a flat then that’s up to them.

‘But that’s not the lifestyle I want and not the lifestyle I have chosen.’
