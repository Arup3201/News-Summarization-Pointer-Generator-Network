Roger Federer began grand slam life as a father of four with a supremely comfortable victory over Lukas Lacko in the first round of the French Open.

The 2009 champion arrived in Paris this week with his expanded family in tow following the birth of his second set of twins, Lenny and Leo, nearly three weeks ago.

His four-year-old daughters, Charlene and Myla, were in his box on Court Philippe Chatrier for the start of his 6-2 6-4 6-2 win against Slovakian Lacko.

Mission: Federer hasn't won the French Open since 2009

Federer lost his first match since the
 birth of his sons in Rome to Frenchman Jeremy Chardy but was never 
troubled on Sunday, perhaps not surprisingly given Lacko has not won a 
match on clay for three years.

He
 had not even contested a match on the surface since Roland Garros last 
year and was forced to fight hard for the games he did win.

Lacko
 saved six of the 11 break points he faced but did not create a single 
one on the Federer serve, winning just nine points on the fourth seed's 
serve in the match.

Untroubled: Lacko did not cause Federer any real problems as the Swiss recorded victory in under 90 minutes

Federer 
won five games in a row to win the first set and his only frustration 
would have been that it took him an hour and 24 minutes to wrap up 
victory.

One of the most 
intriguing first-round match-ups pitted eighth seed Milos Raonic against
 19-year-old Australian wild card Nick Kyrgios.

The teenager looks set to have a bright future but he found Raonic too tough, the Canadian winning 6-3 7-6 (7/1) 6-3.

Father: The Swiss star is now the father of two sets of twins

Not surprisingly, Federer, who extends his record by playing in a 58th consecutive grand slam tournament, was in a very positive mood after the match.

The Swiss said: 'Everything is great.

'I'm happy I got off to a good start for the tournament here in Paris. There's always that little bit of a feeling that if you don't feel well, if the opponent plays great, whatever happens, you could lose early.

'So I was happy getting early signs out of the match that I was actually playing well and I was going to get my chances I was looking for. I'm very pleased with the outcome of the match.

'My personal life, as we know, it's all great, so I'm happy the family is here.'

Federer, meanwhile, does not agree with the bookmakers that Novak Djokovic is the favourite for the men's title ahead of eight-time champion Rafael Nadal.

'Rafa is the favourite, and then Novak, and then the rest," he said. "It's very clear.'

Sixth seed Tomas Berdych, sporting an eye-catching floral shirt, made smooth progress through to the second round with a 6-3 6-4 6-4 win over Peter Polansky of Canada while Mikhail Youzhny and Radek Stepanek both recovered from two sets down.
