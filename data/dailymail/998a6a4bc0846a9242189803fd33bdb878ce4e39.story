Two of England’s most famous prisons are facing the axe.

Reading – made famous by Oscar Wilde’s 1897 poem The Ballad of Reading Gaol, after he was held there – and Dartmoor, opened in 1809, are among five named by the Ministry of Justice.

Blundeston in Suffolk, Dorchester in West Dorset, Northallerton in North Yorkshire and Reading are all to close by next March.

Dartmoor Prison, which belongs to the Duchy of Cornwall, required ten years' notice before it can be handed back

They have room for a total of 1,400 inmates but are either too expensive to run or need ‘substantial’ investment, officials said.

Four of the prisons - Reading, Blundeston in Suffolk, Dorchester in West Dorset, Northallerton in North Yorkshire - will be shut next March, saving the taxpayer £30million.

Union leaders said the announcement was a huge blow to the 700 prison guards working there and could lead to ‘severe overcrowding’ elsewhere.

Between them, the four jails have room for 1,400 inmates.

Dartmoor - which is more than 200 years old and belongs to the Prince Charles’ Duchy of Cornwall - requires ten-years’ notice before it can be handed back.

But the Ministry of Justice wants to find a new use for the jail, which holds around 600 inmates and has its own museum, as quickly as possible.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has given a commitment there will be no reduction in the overall size of the prison estate.

Yesterday he said work would start next summer on a new 2,000-place 'super' prison in Wrexham, north Wales.

The £250million jail is expected to become fully operational by late 2017, creating 1,000 'much-needed' jobs, Mr Grayling said.

Feasibility work has also started on a second large prison to be built in the south east of England, most likely in west London.

Move comes after the Ministry of Justice announced plans for 2,000-place 'super-prison' in Wales (pictured is artist's impression)

But Prison Officers Association general secretary Steve Gillan said that - with 1,800 staff having already lost their jobs in the last 18 months - the new closures could cause major problems.

He warned: ‘With the assaults going on 
and the violence going on, we are extremely concerned by the powder keg 
situation now in prisons and the severe overcrowding.'

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the closures were part of ministry's cost-saving measures

In other moves, HMP Downview in Surrey will change function to hold male rather than female offenders and HMYOI Warren Hill in Suffolk, will stop holding young offenders and will change to hold adult male prisoners.

Mr Grayling said: ‘This is the latest part of our plan to modernise our prisons, bring down costs, but to make sure that by the next election we still have access to more prison places than we inherited in 2010.’ The fresh closures come after it was announced in January that six prisons would shut and three jails would be partially closed as part of a far-reaching overhaul.

The MoJ also announced at the time that it would build four new ‘mini-prisons’, known as house blocks, at HMPs Parc, Peterborough, the Mount and Thameside.

The mini-prisons will hold up to 1,260 prisoners and will replace older, more expensive prison capacity.

Max Chambers, head of crime and justice at the think tank Policy Exchange, said: ‘The Government is right to be closing down old, Victorian prisons that are grossly inefficient, poorly-located and ill-equipped to reduce reoffending.

‘The replacement of our worn-out estate with large, new hub prisons will deliver massive savings to the taxpayer and provide better opportunities for rehabilitation.’ Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: “Closing small local prisons and replacing them with super-sized jails will not reduce crime or make communities safer.

‘You can and should modernise the prison system without throwing taxpayers’ money down the prison-building drain.’
