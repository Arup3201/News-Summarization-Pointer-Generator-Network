A 13-year-old girl was impaled for about 45 minutes on a school fence in Sydney before she was rescued and taken to hospital.

The school girl reportedly tried to climb over a two metre fence when she slipped onto a one-inch metal spike, which speared into her calf this morning.

Emergency crew were notified and called to Chifley College Shalvey, west of Sydney, at about 11.20am.

The teenager was hanging upside down when the rescue team arrived at the scene.

Fire and Rescue NSW used cutting tools to remove part of the school fence, leaving the metal spike embedded in the teenager's leg. 

A spokeswoman for Fire and Rescue NSW confirmed the girl was transported to the Children's Hospital at Westmead at about 12.05pm.

The Careflight Rapid Response trauma team also flew to the scene and assisted paramedics as they accompanied the teen to hospital.

A NSW Ambulance spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia the girl suffered a serious leg injury but is in a stable condition.

A spokesman for the NSW Department of Education and Communities told Daily Mail Australia the student had climbed over the fence 'taking a shortcut to enter school grounds'.

'The school and the Department has praised the excellent response, care, concern and good thinking of five older students who came to her aid providing immediate assistance and reporting the incident to staff,' the spokesman said.

'Teachers who held her to relieve pressure for almost an hour have also been highly commended.'

The spokesman says counselling has been made available to students at Chifley College Shalvey Campus who have concerns following the incident.
