Trampled to death: Sandra Wiltshire was killed along with dog Bruce by a herd of stampeding cows

The devastated family of a retired account clerk trampled to death by a herd of cows today paid tribute to a 'lovely' woman who died along with her dog in the stampede.

Devoted dog owner Sandra Wiltshire, 68, was walking Golden Labrador Bruce, 11, in a field near their home when the cattle spooked and charged.

Both were seriously injured in the crush and Mrs Wiltshire - who had walked in the field for 20 years - died at the scene minutes later after suffering a cardiac arrest.

Bruce was taken to a vet but his injuries were too severe and he was put down later that day.

Today, devastated friends and family paid tribute to Mrs Wiltshire, who had owned rescue dog Bruce for nine years.

Grieving
 husband George Wiltshire, who lived with Sandra just streets away from 
the field in Chippenham, Wilts, described her as 'a wonderful woman'.

Retired
 lorry driver George said: 'She was lovely. I loved her to bits. She 
looked after me brilliantly. I have lost both Sandra and Bruce.'

Mrs
 Wiltshire and Bruce were discovered by two horrified dog walkers after 
they were attacked at around 8.30am on Thursday, October 11.

Paramedics who arrived at the scene on the banks of the River Avon were unable to save Mrs Wiltshire.

Clive
 and Joan Rathband, who were close friends and neighbours with Mrs 
Wiltshire, said she probably died protecting her beloved dog.

Mrs Rathband said: 'I think she would have died protecting her dog. She would have defended him to the death.

'Bruce was very old and wasn't capable of running. He could just waddle along.

'Sandra was friends to everyone. She loved animals. She was always immaculately dressed, enjoyed singing and was an avid reader.

'She always cared for her elderly relatives.'

Mr Rathband, a friend of Mrs Wiltshire for 50 years, said: 'Bruce was the most placid dog I have ever met. Nothing fazed him.

'He was just friendly with every dog he met and every person he met. He and Sandra were absolutely devoted to each other.

'She loved walking and walked Bruce twice a day. Bruce loved the river.'

Best friends: Bruce was being taken for a walk by owner Sandra Wiltshire when the cows struck, and he was later put down

The fields where Mrs Wiltshire died are on the banks of the River Avon and an official footpath runs through the top.

But the lower part of the fields by the side of the river - where Mrs Wiltshire was - are not a footpath but are popular with walkers.

Friend Chris Jones, who has two boxer dogs, lives close to Mrs Wiltshire and has known her for the last 20 years.

Mrs Jones said: 'Sandra visited the fields twice or sometimes three times a day. That's the first serious incident that has been there.

'She was brave and not stupid. There was no way Bruce was antagonising those cows. He was a plodder. If anything happened to Bruce Sandra would have rescued him.'

Wiltshire police are investigating the circumstances of Mrs Wiltshire's death on behalf of Wiltshire Coroner David Ridley.

It is not yet clear exactly what happened to cause the cows to trample the pensioner and her dog.

She was able to tell walkers who found her what happened before passing away.

Mrs Wiltshire's distraught mother, Brenda Beint, 91, who lives in Calne, Wilts., with husband Leonard, said her daughter was 'lovely'.

She said: 'We are in absolute shock. I cannot tell you how much I miss her. Sandra was a lovely, bubby personality and she and I always enjoyed our time together so much.

'We tried to get out to have lunch together at least once a fortnight or three weeks and we went out last Wednesday.

'It was lovely and I am so glad that we did that.'

Tragedy: Blackbridge Road in Chippenham, close to where yesterday's accident took place

The owner of the cows involved in the incident - which have since been removed from the land - is believed to be Brian Mifflin, of Grove Farm, Langley Burrell.

Mr Mifflin was not available for comment.

A pair of horrified dog walkers 
discovered Mrs Wiltshire and her pet and rushed to a nearby street to 
call emergency services, yesterday.

Paramedics
 from Great Western Ambulance Service rushed to the scene but were 
unable to save the woman, who had suffered a cardiac arrest. She died at the scene.

Her dog is being treated at a local vets for multiple injuries, including fractured hips.

Wiltshire Police say the woman's injuries were consistent with being trampled

After the tragedy the wife of the cow's owners, who would not reveal her name, said: 'It is very sad and very unfortunate.

'She was found in our field where our cows with the calves were.

'I think there should be more publicity in the vets and pet shops so people would be aware that you take a risk.

'I would not go into a field with cows and calves with a dog.'

She
 added: 'We are so shocked. My husband and son went down there. People 
walk where they think they will. And there is nothing you can do 
anything about it. It is a sad accident.

'They are our cattle. Anybody who knows their country code would not walk in a field with cows and calves.'

Claire Usher, spokeswoman for Wiltshire police, confirmed that officers were investigating the incident.

She
 said: 'We can confirm that officers were called to assist paramedics in
 a field near to Riverside Drive, Chippenham, shortly before 9am this 
morning.

'On arrival the body of a lady believed to be in her seventies was found.

'There
 do not appear to be any suspicious circumstances surrounding her death 
at this stage and an investigation will be commenced on behalf of HM 
Coroner for Wiltshire.

'Formal identification has not yet been carried out and officers are in the process of informing her next of kin.'

An inquest into Mrs Wiltshire's death will be held at a later date.

In a separate incident, a 46-year-old man was rushed to hospital in Shropshire the following morning when he was trampled by cows while walking his dog.

The victim, who has not been named was in a field in Whittington at 9.15am when the
 animals set on him.

After knocking him to the ground, the cows repeatedly kicked him before he managed to scramble to safety and dialled 999.

A
 West Midlands Ambulance Service spokeswoman said: 'The 46-year-old man 
was next to the field being cared for by passers-by when crews arrived.

'The
 man had been walking his dog across the field when the cows suddenly 
charged, trampling and kicking him before he managed to escape.

'Crews assessed the man and found he had sustained facial, chest and leg injuries.

'The
 man was given pain relief and oxygen before being taken by land 
ambulance to Royal Shrewsbury Hospital for further assessment and 
treatment.'

Meanwhile in June last year,  farmer Alexander 'Sandy' Banks, 64, was killed by a stampeding cow that he just given birth in Halkirk, Caithness, Scotland.

He had been 
helping the newborn to suckle and, as is common practice, had tied a 
rope around the mother’s neck and his own waist.

The cow suddenly bolted, dragging him for some distance across his farm and trampling on him.

Mr Banks, an experienced farmer, died of
 multiple injuries, according to a written submission made public 
yesterday following a fatal accident inquiry (FAI) which was held in 
August.

Wick Sheriff Andrew Berry said it was 'a sad and tragic accident'. 

Commenting
 on the findings, a spokesman for NFU Scotland said: 'This is a tragic 
accident that acts as a sad reminder to all livestock farmers and their 
staff that we work in a hazardous and dangerous industry.

'A
 small number of deaths and injuries related to handling cattle are 
recorded each year but each incident has implications for family and 
friends.'

The spokesman
 added: 'Increasingly, those working with cattle are doing so in 
isolation and many farmers are aware of times when the unpredictable 
nature of stock, the availability of handling facilities and the risks 
involved have not been given due consideration.

'The tragic circumstances around Mr Banks’ death should make us all think a wee bit more about these things.'
