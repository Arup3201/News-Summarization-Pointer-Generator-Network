A mother and her toddler remain in a serious condition in hospital after they were dragged 30 metres down a footpath when they were hit by an alleged ice-fuelled driver.

Kristine Kelly, 23, and her two-year-old daughter were injured when a Holden Commodore ploughed into them and two other women in Belmore, south-west of Sydney, on Sunday afternoon.

Peter Boslikouski, 50, was denied bail at Newtown Local Court on Monday after it was alleged he smoked ice and stayed awake for three days before the crash.

Kristine Kelly, 23, and her two-year-old daughter were injured when a Holden Commodore ploughed into them and two other women in Belmore, south-west of Sydney, on Sunday afternoon

Peter Boslikouski, 50, was denied bail at Newtown Local Court on Monday, where it was alleged he had smoked ice and stayed awake for three days before the crash 

Ms Kelly's daughter was thrown from her pram when the car hit, while her two family friends Samantha and Suzanne Dobe suffered broken bones, the Daily Telegraph reports. 

They were all rushed to St George Hospital where Ms Kelly remains in a serious condition. Her daughter is in a stable condition at the Sydney Children's Hospital.   

'She's better than what she was when she first came in but they are still monitoring her,' the little girl's father Brad Watson said. 

Immediately after the crash, police alleged the driver pretended he wasn't driving.

'Mr Boslikouski tried to disguise the fact that he was driving,' Magistrate Robert Williams said.

A mother and her two-year-old daughter were seriously hurt when a Holden Commodore ran into them and two other women on a footpath in Belmore on Sunday afternoon 

The two other women, 21 and 49, are listed as stable after they were rushed to hospital

Police were called to Canterbury Road about 2.40pm on Sunday after receiving reports Boslikouski had crashed along the footpath and struck the pedestrians. 

Boslikouski, from Bass Hill, was taken to hospital to be treated and was charged when he was released at 2.45am on Monday morning. 

He was charged with numerous offences, including three counts of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm.

He was refused bail with the prosecutor arguing he had a lengthy criminal history and was already on bail for breaking apprehended violence orders. 

His family told the Telegraph they felt 'sick' when they heard about the crash.

'We prayed for (injured women) yesterday. I hope to God they are okay. I cried. It's just so said. This is someone's wife and daughter.'

Witness Briannan Purser told 9News on Sunday that she saw the women lying on the ground, covered in blood. 

'I saw two ladies on the ground along with a child who had blood around her face,' she said. 

The mother and daughter had been walking with two family friends, Samantha and Suzanne Dobe, when they were hit on Sunday afternoon

It is believed the little girl was thrown from her pram when the car hit 

The 23-year-old mother's condition has improved to serious but stable and her daughter, who suffered head injuries, is in a stable condition at the Sydney Children's Hospital

Inspector Rick Agius from NSW Police told reporters that the event was 'tragic'. 

'It's tragic. Tragic for the family and the child,' he said. 

'People think they're safe on the footpath walking along with a young child.'

During a bail hearing on Monday morning, he offered a $10,000 surety and said he would live with his brother and stick to whatever curfew the court wished to impose.

The court heard he had strong community ties and two children he visits regularly.

The prosecution opposed bail, which was denied by Mr Williams.

'The nature of the offence is serious,' the magistrate said.

Boslikouski is due to appear at Central Local Court on March 9 via audio visual link.

Boslikouski, from Bass Hill, was taken to hospital to be treated and was charged when he was released at 2.45am on Monday morning
