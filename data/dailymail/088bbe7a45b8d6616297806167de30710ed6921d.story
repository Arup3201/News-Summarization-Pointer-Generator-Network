Two young brothers dubbed 'demons from hell' after making their neighbours' lives a misery are still getting into trouble with the law nearly a decade later.

Ricky and Daniel Oakley were both given anti-social behaviour orders in 2006 when they were just 11 and 12.

It was hoped the ASBOs would help put a stop to their loutish behaviour which included throwing knives, starting fires and letting down tyres in their hometown of Park Village in Wolverhampton.

But fast-forward eight years and it seems not much has changed, with both brothers - who were once nicknamed the 'Asbros' - having racked up a string of criminal convictions.

The Oakleys feature in a new documentary Running Riot: Britain's Teen Crims, which looks at what has become of some of the UK's most notorious tearaway teens.

And in the case of the brothers, it seems they decided to continue down the road of misdemeanors and petty crime. 

Daniel Oakley, now 20, was yesterday sentenced to a 12-month probation order at Walsall Magistrates Court after pleading guilty to burglary. He was also ordered to pay £570. It is his fourth criminal conviction to date.

Meanwhile is brother Ricky, now 18, has 
been in and out of prison six times since he and his brother were first 
given two-year ASBOs in 2006.

It demanded the pair behave or face five years in a young offenders institution but both brothers now admit they just saw the ASBOs as badges of honour.

Ricky told documentary makers: 'The 
ASBO really didn't bother me. It was like: "We've got one, you haven't. 
We've been to the police station and to court". They were a badge of 
honour.'

The boys claim they grew up in a troubled household. Abandoned by their mother at a young age and left in the sole care of their father, they said they became used to committing antisocial behaviour and crime.

Ricky said: 'My mum wasn’t there for us. We didn’t have the family support we needed.

'I
 thought what’s the point? I may as well go out and get in trouble 
because I’m having more fun with that than I am with my family.'

During
 their reign of terror in their small community, the brothers often set things a light, which on one occasion resulted in the pair both suffering severe burns 
after Ricky placed a can of foam on a fire and it exploded.

Ricky
 said: 'Me and my brother were setting fire bins, anything we could really. We’d make fires in the street. We even set fire to one of the neighbour’s car. We did it for attention.

'We were doing general kids stuff - knocking on people’s door, 
running off, putting bricks through windows, smashing up neighbours 
cars, smashing the fences, jumping over back gardens.'

Danny added: 'I did used to find it funny to go out there and cause trouble. Everything I did was a laugh.

'I thought it’s funny to throw an egg or to smash someone’s fence down or to rob someone’s car.'

At 10 years old, the boys’ petty crimes escalated to burglaries and robberies.

Danny admitted: 'It wasn’t just once a week it. It was constant offending - every single day.'

Ricky added: 'We were taking anything we could - TVs, PlayStations, any mobile phones, gold. Anything you could carry under your arm we’d take it.

'And we’d sell it straight away so when the police came around they’d have no evidence on us so they’d have to release us.'

He added: 'When we robbed people with a knife we’d say give me all your shit out of your pockets now, otherwise you’re going to get stabbed.

'The reason people took it so seriously was because people had heard from our neighbours what we were like and we’d stop at nothing to get what we wanted.'

Despite receiving the ASBOs, the brothers say they still found a way to carry out their criminal activities.

Danny said: 'My ASBO never banned me from coming in to Walsall town centre.

'There are a lot of shops that are quite easy for shoplifters. My brother and I didn’t used to care. We’d walk in to a shop like it was our own shop and take what we wanted.'

Ricky added: 'When I was younger people probably saw me as a bit of psychopath. They said we didn’t have empathy, we didn’t care about people. We didn’t see it like that. We just thought why should we care about people.'

But since 2006, Danny claims he has tried to get his life back on track.

He said: 'I’m well known for bad things. I don’t want to be known for that anymore. All I can do is apologise for what I’ve done.

'I’m now just thinking positive. I’m going to get myself somewhere to live and I’m going to get a job and star working.'

His brother, however, doesn't share his concerns.

Ricky, who was released from 
Brinsford prison, Wolverhampton, last month, said: 'I’m not bothered about going back [to jail]. It doesn’t bother me because I’m not scared of jail.

'That’s why I go back so many times because I’m not scared.'

He added: 'In jail you get three meals a day,
 a warm bed and a TV, you get people looking after you.

'Some people 
have got more on the inside than they have on the outside. That’s why 
most people go back to jail because they’ve got less on the outside than
 they do in jail.'
