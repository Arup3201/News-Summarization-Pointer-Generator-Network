Killed: Ibragim Todashev, 27, was shot and killed by FBI agents in May, more than a month after the Boston Marathon bombing

The FBI agent who fatally shot Ibragim Todashev in his small Orlando apartment last year has a troubling, controversial history as a former officer for the Oakland Police Department in California, the Boston Globe reports.

Not much was known about the agent who killed the Chechen friend of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev because the FBI declined to identify him, but it has now been revealed that the agent’s name is 41-year-old Aaron McFarlane.

According to the Globe, McFarlane retired from the department at the age of 31 after he was the subject of two police brutality lawsuits and four internal affairs investigations.

Authorities have said the agent was justified in shooting Todashev because he lunged at the investigators inside his apartment.

Now a Muslim civil rights group is demanding an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and state officials into what it calls the 'checkered history' of the FBI agent recently cleared in the fatal 2013 shooting of Ibragim Todashev, an acquaintance of one of the accused Boston Marathon bombers.

'If the DOJ and the State Attorney's offices did not know about the agent's history, how can the public trust the thoroughness and reliability of the investigation?' Hassan Shibley, director of the Florida chapter of the Council on Islamic-American Relations (CAIR), wrote in a letter this week to the civil rights office of the Department of Justice.

Shibley also sent letters to the FBI director and the State Attorney in Orlando asking if they knew about the agent's past.

Self defense: Ibragim Todashev, pictured with his wife, was in the middle of being questioned when he was shot dead and a new report reveals that he tried attacking the FBI agents with a pole before he was shot

Ibragim Todashev, a 27-year-old mixed 
martial arts fighter, was killed in Orlando in May while FBI agents and 
Massachusetts state troopers questioned him about his friendship with 
suspected Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev.

Officials originally said Todashev 
lunged at an agent with a knife while he was being questioned. They 
later said it was no longer clear what happened.

Authorities
 say Todashev befriended the late Tsarnaev brother while living in 
Boston and agreed to cooperate with the FBI’s investigation as officials
 narrowed in on the brothers last year.

During the May 22 interrogation,
 however, he reportedly turned violent and lunged towards officials, 
prompting shots to be fired.

The Boston Globe identified the agent who finally killed him as Aaron McFarlane, 41, formerly with the Oakland Police Department in California.

Two
 investigations, one by the FBI itself and one by the Florida Attorney 
General’s office, exonerated the FBI in the shooting death, claiming the
 agent, never identified, had been acting in self-defense, when Todashev
 allegedly ran at him with a raised broom handle.

According
 to the Globe on Wednesday, and old newspaper clippings and court 
records included in a CAIR press release, the FBI agent, while a police 
officer in Oakland, invoked his constitutional right not to answer 
questions under oath as a witness in a police corruption trial, and was 
also the subject of two settled police brutality cases in 2003.

'How
 credible and thorough are the DOJ and State Attorney's investigations -
 which relied heavily on testimony given by individuals who may have 
engaged in police misconduct, civil rights abuses, and evidence 
falsification?' Shibley wrote in his letter to the DOJ.

Federal
 prosecutors have said in court filings that Todashev named Tsarnaev as a
 participant in an earlier triple homicide in Massachusetts.

The filings
 were made in the case against Tsarnaev's brother, surviving bombing 
suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.

Cleared: Florida prosecutors have chosen not to pursue charges against FBI agents involved in the killing (seen in May after his death)

Connections: FBI agents and Massachusetts state troopers questioned him about his friendship with suspected Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev

Earlier this year a Florida prosecutor cleared the FBI agent of any criminal wrongdoing in the fatal shooting.

According
 to the Globe, McFarlane appears to have a checkered past at Oakland’s 
Police Department - a police department that has such an extraordinary 
record of corruption and brutality, that since 2012 it has been operated
 under the supervision of a federal court 'compliance director,' whose 
job is to see that officers don’t brutalize residents or violate their 
civil rights.

The paper also
 reports that during his four years with the Oakland Police, he was the 
subject of two police brutality lawsuits and four internal affairs 
investigations.

'McFarlane 
had worked at the troubled Oakland department from 2000 to 2004, during 
the biggest police corruption scandal in the city’s history,' The Globe 
reported. He later pleaded the Fifth to avoid incriminating himself 
during testimony related to the probe.

In
 one case of alleged police brutality, the department awarded $22,500 to
 a man who accused the police of assault and false imprisonment. In an 
other, a man was was paid $10,000 for alleged 'force and civil rights 
violations.'

The Globe also 
identified Curtis Cinelli and Joel Gagne as the two Massachusetts State 
Police Troopers who were in the room when Todashev was shot.

Neither trooper was involved in the Todashev shooting, according to the Florida or FBI investigations.

Dzhokhar
 Tsarnaev — the younger brother of the slain suspected bomber—will be 
tried later this year for his role in the April 15, 2013 bombing. If 
found guilty, prosecutors said they will seek the death penalty.

According
 to the filings, Todashev told investigators Tamerlan Tsarnaev 
participated in a triple slaying in Waltham on September 11, 2011.

State
 Attorney Jeff Ashton, who had jurisdiction over the shooting, concluded
 that Todashev was writing a statement after a long interview when he 
suddenly attacked the agent and officer.

Neither
 Ashton's office, the Department of Justice nor the FBI responded on 
Wednesday to requests for comment. All three agencies kept the 
identities of the agent and officer secret.
