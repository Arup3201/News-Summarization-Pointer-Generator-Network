The day of reckoning has arrived for Wayne Rooney with England facing Uruguay here in a World Cup game they must win.

With
 Rooney set to move into his favoured central position after his 
unsatisfactory role on the left against Italy, he must deliver the goals
 which Roy Hodgson’s team desperately need.

Uruguay
 were defensively woeful in their opening defeat by Costa Rica and have 
been weakened by the absence tonight of the suspended Maxi Pereira and 
the injury to captain Diego Lugano.

Support: England boss Roy Hodgson has kept faith with Wayne Rooney for crucial game

Rooney, who has 39 goals for England, almost as many as the total number of goals scored by the rest of the expected starting XI, must repay Hodgson’s faith in him and fire England towards the knockout stage.

The pressure is clearly on him yet a few weeks ago, when Rooney was training in Portugal with his England team-mates, he seemed determined to enjoy the World Cup. He was relaxed and refreshed after spending a few days working with England’s fitness coaches in the build-up to the tournament.

This evening, when he takes to the field at the Arena de Sao Paulo in his No 10 shirt, the England forward will face further scrutiny.

It will be that way until he scores his first goal at a World Cup. The Uruguay game will be his 10th attempt to get off the mark at this level.

At the age of 28, he also declared on the
 eve of the tournament that this was the last chance to ‘get the best 
out of me’ at a World Cup.

Every England fan wants him to score, to 
retrace the magical steps that turned him into one of the world’s most 
feared strikers when he first played for the national team.

At Euro 
2004 he scored four times before he was forced off against Portugal 
through injury in the quarter-final. During England’s World Cup 
qualifiers, Rooney was always played in a central role. He responded 
with seven goals.

‘He’s been our top scorer for the past two years and he has more goals and assists than anyone else,’ said Hodgson yesterday.

Influence: Rooney set up Daniel Sturridge for England's goal against Italy on Saturday

‘Were
 it not for his wonderful header against Poland in the qualifiers we 
might not even be here. We’ve got a clear perspective as to what Wayne 
is and what Wayne can do. When you start talking about one man it’s not 
healthy.He’s got broad shoulders and I think he will do well at the 
tournament. Unfortunately, he just has to accept that it often happens 
at a World Cup. At the moment he’s getting a lot of  support from those 
around him.’

Against Italy on Saturday he was stuck out on the left 
and asked to track back to help left back Leighton Baines. He provided 
the assist for Daniel Sturridge’s first World Cup goal, clipping the 
ball into the penalty area for the striker to score.

That contribution, typical of Rooney’s selfless attitude, was largely overlooked in the analysis of his display against Italy.

There were other areas, particularly in defence, that will have been of more pressing concern to the head coach.

Rooney did more running than any other England player and seems to have done enough to satisfy Hodgson.

‘We’re
 very happy with what the team did and Wayne worked very hard like the 
rest of the team but we didn’t  discuss, even in the coaches’ debrief, 
the individual players.’

Although it wasn’t vintage Rooney, he still has the ability to turn games in England’s favour.Yesterday, captain Steven Gerrard revealed that the attention is beginning to eat away at Rooney.

‘He is slightly frustrated being the centre of attention and everyone  talking about his position,’ admitted Gerrard.

‘In
 training he has been fine and looking to the match. For me, against 
Italy he had a big say in the match with an assist and I thought he did 
exactly what the manager had asked him to do.

‘For all the players it
 is  frustrating that one player is getting spoken about more than 
anyone else because we are all sticking together and trying to fight for
 the same thing.’

Rooney has certainly been working hard and Gary 
Neville, England’s assistant manager, wasn’t exaggerating when he told 
BBC Radio 5 Live that he has to be dragged off the training pitches.

On Tuesday, Rooney was restored to his favoured central position during an intensive 90-minute training session.

The
 signs are that he will operate behind Sturridge this evening. If that 
is the case, Rooney will have got his way — forcing Hodgson’s hand for a
 match that England must win.
