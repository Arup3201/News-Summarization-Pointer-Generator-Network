A host of top flight clubs are monitoring young Polonia Warsaw goalkeeper Tomasz Kucz.

Manchester United, Liverpool and Everton have all had the 14-year-old Polish stopper watched this year.

Highly rated Kucz, who is already 5ft 11ins tall, has had two trials at Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen.

Talented: Goalkeeper Tomasz Kucz in action for Poland against Wales in Under 15's match

The first was in January where they filmed his training sessions for five days, which were analysed by coaching staff, and doctors gave him x-rays to identify his growth potential.

And in December last year he also spent time in Scotland with Rangers who are keeping a keen eye on his progress.

But word has spread fast and scouts from across Europe saw him play in Poland Under 15s 3-1 win against Wales at the Corbett Sports Stadium, in Rhyl, in March.

Set for stardom: Polish young keeper Tomasz Kucz

The talented goalkeeper is not short of potential suitors but may consider staying at Polonia Warsaw to continue his development.

He has already trained with their first team – even though he is not yet old enough to play in a senior match – and is breaking into their Under 19 squad.
