Rio Smedley was just two years old when he was beaten to death by Daniel Rigby in April, 2012

A police watchdog has said officers failed to properly investigate a vicious thug’s assault on his pregnant girlfriend just weeks before he beat her toddler son to death. 

Rio Smedley was just two years old when he was beaten to death by Daniel Rigby in April, 2012.

Just a few weeks earlier, Rigby had been arrested on suspicion of assaulting Rio’s pregnant mum Kirsty Smedley but the case was dropped.

Today the Independent Police Complaints Commission ruled that, although the death could not have been prevented, the investigation into the assault had been plagued by errors.

One PC failed to check if CCTV existed of the pair walking near her home in Bolton after the assault.

He also failed to check if neighbours or other witnesses had seen anything suspicious.

The officer failed to question Rigby about his criminal history, make enquiries about Rio or pass on information about his mother’s injuries.

The IPCC say the PC should now face disciplinary action.

Rigby, of Dorset Avenue, Tyldesley, was jailed for life in 2012 for murder after carrying out the horrific attack while Smedley was out buying him cannabis.

Smedley, from Bolton, was found guilty of allowing or causing the death of the child at her home in Cheriton Drive, Breightmet, Bolton and was jailed for four years. 

She claimed her son had fallen down the stairs but analysis of the injuries showed that was a lie.His liver had split in two and he had suffered 91 separate injuries.

The criticised PC and another officer, a sergeant, have already been subject to ‘management action’ by GMP over the way they reviewed the assault allegation before the decision was made to take no further action.

IPCC Commissioner James Dipple-Johnstone said: 'While it cannot be said that if the officers had chosen to take a different course of action against Daniel Rigby Rio Smedley would still be alive today, there were a number of shortcomings identified during our investigation.

'Reports of domestic violence must be treated seriously and acted upon thoroughly, particularly those that involve children who may themselves be at risk.'
