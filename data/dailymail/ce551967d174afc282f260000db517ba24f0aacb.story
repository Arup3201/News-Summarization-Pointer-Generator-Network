The Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury Festival: Tickets for next year have sold out in a record 26 minutes

It took just 26 minutes for all 150,000 tickets, priced at £225 each, to be snapped up - beating last year's record by more than an hour.

Organisers of the festival said: 'Our heartfelt thanks to everyone who's bought a ticket.

'We're humbled by the incredible numbers of people who would like to come to the Festival - and it's clear that demand once again outstripped supply this year.

'We're sorry that some of you have missed out, but there will be a resale of returned tickets in the spring.

'Thank you all for your never-ending support for our Festival.'

Emily Eavis, the co-organiser of the festival, tweeted: 'I'm sorry to everyone who missed out, so wish we could get everyone in. There will be a resale in the spring.'

An allocation of coach tickets went on sale last Wednesday and was snapped up within 15 minutes.

The line-up for the festival has not yet been revealed, but Sixties band Fleetwood Mac are amongst the favourites to be announced.

Last year's bash at Worthy Farm, Pilton, Somerset, saw Dolly Parton headline the famous Pyramid Stage to rave reviews.
