Manchester City new boy Bruno Zuculini is poised to join Valencia on loan after red tape prevented a temporary move to Sunderland. 

The 21-year-old midfielder, who arrived in a £3m deal from Argentine side Racing Club last month, is not able to join a Premier League club and then immediately move to another on loan due to Financial Fair Play legislation and is now heading to La Liga. 

Meanwhile, City will listen to offers for Matija Nastasic, Micah Richards, Scott Sinclair and John Guidetti. Anderlecht have asked to loan City's Belgian defender Dedryck Boyata.
