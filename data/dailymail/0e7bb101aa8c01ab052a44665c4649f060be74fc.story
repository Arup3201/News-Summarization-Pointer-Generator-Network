Jailed again: Convicted rapist Hilland Matthews went on to sexually assault another woman after being released from prison and moving across Britain

A convicted rapist went on to sexually assault another victim after blundering police failed to keep track of him when he moved home across Britain.

Window cleaner Hilland Matthews, 66, carried out an 'horrific sex attack' in Ipswich after moving 250 miles from the scene of his previous rape in South Wales.

An MP today called for an investigation to discover why police failed to pass on Matthews' history of sexual offending after the rapist was jailed again for a sex crime.

Caerphilly MP Wayne David has demanded an investigation into what happened - and is tabling a question to the Home Office.

The Labour MP said: 'This cannot be an issue that continually falls to the bottom of somebody's in-tray.'

Ipswich Crown Court heard last Thursday how Matthews was convicted of rape in 1992 and was freed after serving four years in prison.

It was just months before the sex offenders' register was brought in - but police still had a duty to keep tabs on Matthews.

The court heard Matthews moved from his home in South Wales to Ipswich three years ago.

But police in Suffolk were not told by the Welsh officers that the convicted rapist was now living on their patch.

Matthews broke into the home of a 53-year-old woman where he put her through an 'horrific ordeal'.

Ipswich Crown Court heard the woman deliberately scratched Matthews' face - knowing she would have his DNA under her nails.

Detectives put the sample through the police national computer and came up with a near match for one of Matthews' relatives.

Matthews' profile was not on file because his last known crime was before suspects had to give a DNA sample.

But the court heard police tracked Matthews down through the DNA of a relative - and then realised he had raped before.

Matthews, of Ipswich, was jailed for nine years after admitting two charges of sexual assault and trespass with intent to commit a sexual offence.

Judge David Goodin told him: 'You targeted a woman who lived alone - the horror she must have felt is unimaginable.

'She thought at one stage her last minute had come and that she was going to die.

'As you mauled her she had the courage to fight back and her presence of mind in scratching your face and arms led to your arrest.'

Matthews was aged 46 and living in Caerphilly, South Wales, with his 63-year-old girlfriend when he carried out his first rape.

He broke into the home of an 89-year-old woman and attacked her in her bed where she had been sleeping. He was jailed at Cardiff Crown Court for four years for the attack in 1992.

Ipswich Crown Court heard how Matthews had previously been jailed for 18 months for indecent assault in 1974 and jailed for four years in 1980 for attempted rape.

Matthews had not been on the Sex Offenders’ Register, as his earlier convictions pre-dated the register, which does not include anyone who was convicted before 1997.

Matthews details were kept by Gwent Police in South Wales but were not passed on to officers in Ipswich when he lived there three years ago.

Matthews was ordered to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life when he is eventually freed.

Matthews was living in Caerphilly, South Wales, when he raped an 89-year-old woman. After being released from prison, he moved to Ipswich, but Police in Suffolk weren't notified that a convicted sexual offender had moved into their area
