Are we on the verge of a sex abuse scandal that will dwarf any of the previous outrages involving celebrities such as Jimmy Savile, Max Clifford and Rolf Harris? It certainly seems we may be.

Almost every day brings new charges that suggest the Establishment may have protected ministers, MPs and high officials from investigation into allegations of abuse involving children going back 30 years and more.

This is no sensationalist claim. Yesterday, a former senior Tory Cabinet Minister, Lord Tebbit, raised the incendiary idea that there ‘may well have been’ a political cover-up of sex abuse in the Eighties.

Former senior Tory Cabinet Minister, Lord Tebbit, raised the incendiary idea that there 'may well have been' a political cover-up of sex abuse in the Eighties. It comes after the disappearance of a dossier alleging high-level paedophile activity, handed in 1983 by the late Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens to the then Home Secretary, Leon Brittan

Imagine the effect on public opinion if it were shown that some law-makers had been guilty of paedophilia, and that ministers and civil servants closed ranks to save these wrongdoers from prosecution. It would shatter people’s faith in our political institutions, and very possibly make the MPs’ expenses scandal look like a trivial rumpus.

Of course, we don’t yet know how much sex abuse took place, or the extent of any cover-up. A thorough examination of the evidence might conclude that there was little or no systemic misbehaviour. But we won’t know without a proper public inquiry. The Government is refusing to call one.

David Cameron and senior ministers appear to be in a kind of denial about the seriousness of the allegations. The Education Secretary, Michael Gove, yesterday repeated the party line on the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme that there shouldn’t be a public inquiry.

So far the Government has agreed to ask the Home Office’s most senior official to look into the alarming, and unexplained, disappearance of 114 secret Home Office files on paedophile cases.

It has also conceded a limited and brief investigation by an as yet unnamed senior lawyer into the disappearance of a dossier alleging high-level paedophile activity. This was handed in 1983 by the late Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens to the then Home Secretary, Leon Brittan.

The loss of this dossier, which reportedly included the names of Savile, the Rochdale MP Sir Cyril Smith, and Margaret Thatcher’s former parliamentary private secretary Sir Peter Morrison — all of them now deceased — is too momentous an event to be dealt with by the kind of investigation envisaged by Mr Cameron. Moreover, only the executive summary of this report may be made public.

Compare his reaction, and that of the Government, to the response to the actually incorrect allegation in July 2011 that the News of the World had deleted the voicemails of the murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler nine years earlier, thereby giving her parents ‘false hope’ that she was still alive.

Although there was already a police investigation underway into phone hacking, Mr Cameron lost no time in setting up a full judicial inquiry under Lord Justice Leveson into the ethics of the Press.

Most people would probably say that alleged paedophile activity among senior politicians and officials, and the suggestion of a cover-up, are significantly more serious matters than phone hacking.  

Yet on this occasion Mr Cameron takes refuge in the argument that ‘we mustn’t do anything that could prejudice or prevent proper action by the police’. Quite so. But almost identical considerations didn’t stop him setting up the Leveson Inquiry.

I’m almost certain that only inertia and poor advice are inhibiting the Prime Minister from doing the right thing. The danger, though, is that his critics will say he knows things about a cover-up which he would prefer were not made public.

The refusal of the authorities to grip the issue is also illustrated by the very limited resources which the Metropolitan Police have devoted to Operation Fairbank, set up in November 2012 to investigate the historic allegations of child abuse relating to MPs.

Only seven detectives have been engaged on this task, and, as the Mail reported on Saturday, sources close to Operation Fairbank say it has been under resourced.

By contrast, some 30 officers have been attached to Operation Yewtree, which has successfully investigated sex abuse scandals involving deviant celebrities such as Jimmy Savile, Rolf Harris and Stuart Hall.

In other words, more than four times as many officers have been engaged looking into the historic misdemeanours of celebrities, often going back 30 or even 40 years, as have been involved in investigating equally historic allegations against politicians.

It comes after a Labour peer has been accused of 12 attacks. One source said the allegations were 'horrific'. Pictured is the Lords Chamber at the House of Lords where the peer sits

Meanwhile, 200 detectives have been deployed in investigating phone hacking and bribery allegations against journalists.

Some will say that when it comes to looking into accusations in their own backyard, senior politicians are showing a good deal less enthusiasm than they did when presented with evidence of misconduct among a limited number of journalists.

What could be more serious than the suspicion that ministers, MPs and officials were involved in paedophile activities, and that concerted attempts were made — possibly including the deliberate destruction of evidence — to hush up what had happened?

And that makes it even more important, in the interests of Parliament and good governance, that there should be a full inquiry. For the rumours and stories circulating on the internet and Twitter could well exaggerate what really went on.

Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who has done more than anyone to shed light on paedophile perversion at Westminster, most notably in the case of Cyril Smith, has claimed a senior Tory MP warned him that he was telephoned last weekend by Lady Brittan, wife of Leon Brittan, who was ‘worried’ Danczuk was going to ‘target’ her husband at a Home Affairs Select Committee meeting last Tuesday.

In the event he didn’t, but the mention of Lady Brittan’s call, coupled with reports that Lord Brittan was recently questioned by police over claims that he raped a 19-year-old student in 1967, will only fuel further wild speculation and theorising.

Yet it is perfectly possible that Lord Brittan is innocent of all and any wrong-doing, and that he fulfilled his duties admirably when handed that dossier by Geoffrey Dickens.

We shouldn’t forget the case of Lord McAlpine. In late 2012, he was wrongly fingered as a paedophile by BBC2’s Newsnight, and convicted by Twitterdom, though he was absolutely innocent. Some of his friends believe the stress of these false allegations hastened his death earlier this year.

Whether there was sex abuse and a cover-up among lawmakers on a huge scale, or whether such transgressions were far more limited, can be resolved only by the kind of public inquiry that David Cameron is stubbornly — and damagingly — resisting.
