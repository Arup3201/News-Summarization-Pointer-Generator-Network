A motorist has been jailed for killing an elderly woman because she was distracted by revving her car in anger at two pedestrians who were crossing the road.

Natalie Foulser pressed down on the accelerator because she thought a man and woman were walking deliberately slowly across a dual carriageway.

The 21-year-old driver, who had only recently qualified, continued to stare at the pedestrians, meaning that she failed to see that great-grandmother Averil Monks was still using the crossing.

The 75-year-old former nurse died at the scene after being hit by Miss Foulser at 35mph on the 30mph road in Marton, Lancashire in June last year.

The young woman was seen at the roadside in floods of tears, crying for her father and saying: 'I can't believe I've just killed someone.'

Mrs Monks' widower George, 76, was left so devastated by his wife's death that he refused to sleep in their bedroom, and he died in August.

Foulser, an artist from Fleetwood, was cleared of causing death by dangerous driving but admitted the lesser charge of causing death by careless driving.

She sobbed at Burnley Crown Court last Friday as she was sentenced to eight months in prison and banned from driving for two years.

Guilty: Foulser, pictured arriving at Burnley Crown Court, was revving her car to rebuke two pedestrians

The court heard that Foulser was driving her black and orange Honda Civic in the outside lane of the dual carriageway at the time of the incident.

As she approached the crossing she saw two pedestrians who she thought were walking 'deliberately slowly', so she revved the engine loudly.

Prosecutor Paul Cummings said as she reached the crossing she was still staring at the two pedestrians, just missing them as they stepped onto the pavement.

It was only when she turned back to the road that she saw Mrs Monks in the road, by which time it was too late to avoid a collision.

Witness Gail Miller said: 'I noticed a female on the central reservation who was very upset, I believed her to be the driver of the vehicle involved. I went to her and tried to assist her and calm her down.

'She said, "Two kids were messing about around the junction. I revved my engine to scare them because they were messing about".'

David Marsden, a driving instructor, added: 'The female driver of the car was in hysterics on the central reservation and was screaming, "I want my dad". She then said either "it revved" or "I revved it".'

The two pedestrians involved also gave evidence - Coral Bawden said: 'Just after the crash I did see the driver get out of the car in a distressed state and I heard her say, "I can't believe I've just killed someone."'

Anthony Ainsworth said: 'When we got to the central reservation we could see cars in the distance but they were far enough away for us to make the call to cross.

'As we got close to the pavement I heard a loud noise and it was like a car was revving its engine, so I grabbed Coral and we ran on to the pavement. The car's exhaust made two really loud noises, it was increasing in volume.'

Foulser said she did not use her horn because she did not want to disturb anyone, adding: 'They continued to stare at me and I stared back. They were a hazard in my way and when I stared back, there was another hazard in the way.'

Mrs Monks was described as an 'independent and spritely pillar of the community.' In a statement her family said: 'Averil was a wonderful wife, mother, grandmother and great-grandmother who loved her family very much.

'She helped countless people within the community and was the kind of person who was always willing to help everybody. '

Ban: Foulser, a 21-year-old artist, has been barred from driving for the next two years

In mitigation, Wayne Jackson said: 'This is a momentary lapse of judgement, by somebody who is new to driving. The two pedestrians had hidden Mrs Monks from view beyond the crossing.

'My client has demonstrated genuine and substantial remorse and has been significantly traumatised by what took place. She has apologised every day in her head.

She was a talented artist, described in testimonials as gifted, but humble. People say that since the accident, she has become a changed person and retreated into her shell.'

Judge Robert Altham told Foulser during sentencing: 'It seems plain to me that inexperience must have played some part in this accident.

'Clearly, your attention was focussed on them long after it should have been. It's clear to me that this is not a case where there is a momentary lapse of attention.

'There was at least an element of you rebuking these people by continuing to stare at them and that meant you didn't see Mrs Monks, who was in front of you, until it was far too late. You struck her and you killed her.

'It is clear you are a bright young woman, cherished by your family, but Averil Monks was also somebody cherished by her family.

'After her death, her husband in particular was devastated. He couldn't go home for many months and when he did, he couldn't bring himself to sleep upstairs.

'It's apparent that he changed from being a happy, confident man into being an absolutely inconsolable, unhappy man in the last few months of his life.'
