A team of police disaster specialists will be sent to Ukraine to bring back the nine tragic Britons killed in the Ukrainian air disaster, Downing Street announced today.

The Scotland Yard experts will join a Dutch-led emergency team after a request from the country's prime minister Mark Rutte. A separate team of air-accident investigators have been put on standby to help an international investigation into what caused the crash.

Both operations depend on the pro-Russian separatists granting international access to the crash site. 'That’s why we are pushing so hard internationally to make sure that there is the access,' Mr Cameron's spokeswoman said today. 

Britain is pushing for a UN resolution granting access to international investigators to discover what happened

The plane came down in an area of eastern Ukraine controlled by pro-Russian separatists around the city of Donetsk

Number 10 this morning said getting to the site of the disaster was the Government's first priority. 

The UK has called an emergency session of the UN Security Council  to get international agreement for access.

Moscow and the Russian rebels have both said they will back an investigation, but Downing Street said they needed to back up their words.

A spokesman for Mr Cameron said: 'President Putin has said on this there should be an investigation.

'That is why we said very clearly that people should do all they can to enable that to happen - not just words.'

At least nine Britons are believed to be among 298 passengers and crew who were on board the plane, which was apparently shot down by a surface-to-air missile.

Mr Cameron chaired an emergency meeting of the Governent's crisis committee Cobra this morning to agree how to respond to the crash.

He was joined by the new Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond and new Defence Secretary Michael Fallon.

The Prime Minister's national security advisor Sir Kim Darroch and representatives from the secret services also attended.

Mr Cameron's spokeswoman said this morning’s emergency meeting focused on the need for a 'swift and independent investigation' into the causes and securing access to the crash site for international experts.

Mr Cameron spoke with his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte, the Australian prime minister Tony Abbott, and sent messages of condolence to Malaysian PM Najib Razak.

The Prime Minister's spokeswoman said: 'Clearly it will be the Ukrainian government that are in the lead on this. We are keen to work with them closely and we think there needs to be an independent international investigation.

'So that would look to the role of people like ICAO, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, or looking into Air Accidents Investigation Branch.

'The point I would make is that the crash site is in a separatist-held area and therefore part of the work we are doing is talking closely to the OSCE [Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe], who are clearly the ones that have the monitoring mission in the broader region, about how we can work together and access [the site].

'And it is also why we are pushing for a clear statement at the UN on the need for access.'

Mr Cameron's spokeswoman added: 'The focus was on the huge tragedy that this is for the Netherlands, the need to have an independent investigation.

'It is true that this crash has taken place in the context of a wider crisis in Ukraine and one element of that [is] we have been sending a very clear message to the Russians, along with our European partners and the US, for several weeks now about the need for them to exert their influence on Russian separatists and stop the flow of weapons across the border. Will we keep reiterating that message in the days ahead? Yes.'
