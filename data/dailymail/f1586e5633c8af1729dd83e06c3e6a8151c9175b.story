A schizophrenic man reported missing in Connecticut six years ago has been reunited with his family after an intuitive police officer spotted him wandering in Long Island.

Southampton Town officer Sherakhan Parker saw Euripidis Cruz, 60, walking down Montauk Highway on July 10 and, thinking he was homeless, bought him lunch.

But acting on a 'hunch', Parker searched Cruz's name online and found the former heroin junkie was reported missing on July 8, 2008.

Found: Euripides Cruz, 60, who was reported missing six years ago has been reunited with his family in Waterbury, Connecticut after being found in Long Island on July 10

'I'm just so glad that he's back, that he's OK,' Cruz's 37-year-old niece, Veronica Cruz told News Day. 'We'll take him in any condition.'

She said Cruz was last seen in his Waterbury, Connecticut apartment six years ago and believes he disappeared because of voices in his head.

Relieved: Veronica Cruz, 37, said she was 'so glad' to have her missing uncle home after six years

His brother, Efrain Cruz, said Cruz was in Brooklyn, New York, for a few years because he would occasionally
 get medical bills from Kings County Hospital Center. Cruz lived in Brooklyn 16 years ago.

Police believe Cruz moved from town to town in Long Island before he was found.

'You worry a lot,' Efrain Cruz said. 'You wonder where he's living, where he's sleeping.'

Efrain Cruz's wife, Blanca, picked up her brother-in-law from the police station in Long Island.

Meanwhile Parker, the officer who found Cruz, said he was happy to reunite him with his loved ones.

'I'm just thankful that ... I was afforded the time and resources to assist human life in this instance and that I was blessed to be put in this position to facilitate this awesome reunion,' Parker said.

'This is an event that I will never forget.'
