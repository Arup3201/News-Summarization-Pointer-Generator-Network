Jersey should 'be ready to become independent' in the wake of a slew of political attacks and crackdowns on its tax schemes, a senior politician said today.

Sir Philip Bailhache, the island's assistant chief minister, wants officials to begin preparations for severing its links with the UK because the largest of the Channel Islands is getting a 'raw deal'.

Prime Minister David Cameron last 
week branded comedian Jimmy Carr 'morally wrong' for pumping millions into Jersey-based 
company K2 to avoid paying tax.

The people of Scotland are already set to vote on independence from the UK in 2014.

Jersey is suffering increasingly strained relations with Westminster and its government claims over the last five years MPs have made it 'very plain' they want to damage its economy.

For decades its relaxed laws drew in the rich and big business because of its tax set-up, but since the financial crisis successive UK governments have fought to clampdown on banks and tax avoidance, hitting Jersey badly.

This was further compounded when Jersey and Guernsey lost their High Court bid in March to stop the Treasury scrapping a tax loophole that allowed the Channel Islands to sell DVDs and CDs VAT-free.

'I feel that we get a raw deal. I feel it's not fair. I think that the duty of Jersey politicians now is to try to explain what the island is doing and not to take things lying down,' Sir Philip said in an interview with the Guardian.

'The island should be prepared to stand up for itself and should be ready to become independent if it were necessary in Jersey's interest to do so.

'I hope that the constitutional relationship with the UK will continue. But if it becomes plain that our interests in fact lie in being independent it doesn't seem to me that we should bury our head in the sand and say we're not going to do that.'

Scandal: Jimmy Carr invested in a Jersey-based tax scheme and islanders fear this could make the situation even worse

Despite being largely self-governing and not officially part of the UK or the EU, it is not independent from Britain.

And the Coalition has tried to clamp down hard on its tax affairs to drag more revenue into the Treasury.

In his last budget Chancellor George Osborne told MPs: 'I regard tax evasion – and, indeed, aggressive tax avoidance – as morally repugnant,'  and said he would close loopholes related to offshore pensions and VAT-free websites - hitting Jersey hard.

Civil servants have been asked build new anti-avoidance laws, many of which would also hurt the island's economy.

Bailhache has said that Jersey would have to deal with the moral outrage in Britain over tax avoidance but would also have to get a fair deal.

Another senior politician said that the island was in huge danger of being unfairly hit because Jimmy Carr's investment in Jersey has become so high profile.

'The UK tax code is horrifically complicated. It has all sorts of exemptions and allowances and schemes – and that's fertile ground for tax avoiders,' he told the Guardian.

And in the face of this vitriol Jersey has opened offices in London and Washington DC for the first time as well as hiring PR specialists Brunswick to improve their image.

Bailhache, who is also in charge of Jersey's international relations, added: 'We want to educate. We want to explain what the island is doing.

'We understand that the movement is towards collecting as much tax as the UK legitimately can do and it's not part of our function to help UK citizens to avoid paying their dues in the UK.'

Jersey has an interesting and sometimes violent history, changing hands several times in the past 1,000 years or so.

It was conquered by the Vikings in the ninth century and eventually claimed by the Normans in 933.

When William the Conqueror took England from King Harold at Hastings the islands first became linked to Britain.

Two centuries later King John lost all his territories in mainland Normandy, and the islands, in 1204.

But Jersey and the Channel Islands decided to become Crown dependencies and have been loyal to the English monarchy 
ever since, despite several skirmishes and invasions.

In 1781, at the height of tensions 
between France and Britain, a French invasion force of 2,000 tried to 
take over the island but failed.

During World War II, Jersey was 
occupied by Nazi Germany for nearly five years between July 1 1940 until
May 9 1945. Russian slaves were brought there to fortify it and it was 
one of the last parts of Europe to be freed from German tyranny.
