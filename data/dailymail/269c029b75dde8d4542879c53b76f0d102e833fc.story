David Cameron was accused of complacency over the Iraq crisis last night as he left Downing Street to resume his beach holiday.

The Prime Minister headed for Cornwall straight after breakfast yesterday having spent only 19 hours in London.

He had interrupted his family vacation following the brutal murder of US hostage James Foley by a British Jihadist fighting with Islamic State.

As Mr 
Cameron was pictured by a holidaymaker visiting a cafe and deli in Rock 
with wife Samantha, No. 10 insisted he would continue to receive regular
 briefings on the crisis. But critics accused the Prime Minister of a 
dereliction of duty – and questioned why he has refused to recall 
Parliament to debate Mr Foley’s murder and the threat to security posed 
by jihadis who return to the UK.

In
 the US, President Obama faced similar criticism after he was pictured 
smiling on the golf course within minutes of giving a speech condemning 
the murder.

Labour
 MP Ann Clwyd, former British human rights envoy to Iraq, said of Mr 
Cameron: ‘I just find it extraordinary that he has gone off on holiday 
again after a few hours back in London – it is just not good enough. If 
he is serious about the threat to Britain, as he says he is and as he 
ought to be, then he should not be pushing off on holiday. He should be 
recalling MPs to Parliament so that we can discuss the situation and 
debate our response.

‘Thousands
 of police are being drafted in to police the Nato summit in Wales next 
month because of the threat from Isis and related organisations. That is
 really frightening for some people and they expect to see the Prime 
Minister taking charge.’

John Woodcock, a Labour member of the Commons defence committee, said Mr Cameron’s decision sent out the wrong signal.

‘With
 the rise of IS extremists we are probably facing the biggest threat to 
our values and the country’s security since 9/11,’ he said. ‘The 
combination of the PM not being at his desk and his refusal to bring MPs
 back to the Commons sends a terribly complacent signal at a time when 
we should be showing the world we will never tolerate these hideous 
incidents and these awful people.

People
 will not understand why the Prime Minister is dipping in and out of his
 holidays when the rest of us are sitting frustrated in our 
constituencies and have to watch events on the news.

‘He
 should be holding ministers to account and speaking on behalf of the 
country about what we should do.’ Many Tory MPs are also pressing for a 
recall of Parliament. None would publicly criticise Mr Cameron for 
returning to the beach so quickly, but one said: ‘The fact is we should 
all be recalled, not just the Prime Minister. At the moment it seems 
like the only way to ask him a question is to hire a Cornish ice cream 
van and set up on the beach.’  Mr Cameron is on his second holiday of 
the summer. On Monday, he insisted he was always ‘within a few feet’ of 
his mobile phone and would ‘return instantly’ if the situation worsened.

That evening, IS extremists released the horrific video of Mr Foley’s murder by a masked man with a London accent.

The
 following morning Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond initially suggested 
that Mr Cameron would remain in Cornwall. But within the hour Mr Cameron
 decided he needed to be at No. 10.

Government sources said Mr Cameron felt it was appropriate to return to Cornwall yesterday.

Sources
 said a secure phone line had been set up to ensure he can talk to 
ministers, officials and other world leaders at any time.

Mr
 Obama is also on holiday – at his vacation home in exclusive Martha’s 
Vineyard. He had returned to the White House on Sunday for two days of 
meetings and was flying back to Massachusetts when he learned of the IS 
video.

He delivered a speech condemning Mr Foley’s murder but was on the golf course minutes later.

Some have criticised his 16-day holiday – and his fondness for playing golf – at a time of world crisis.
