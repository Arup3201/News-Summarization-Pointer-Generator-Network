This week sees the final act in the long-running Pistorius trial, with the athlete set to discover his fate - whether a lengthy prison sentence or parole.

But an explosive new book written by a journalist who has covered the trial from start to finish and was the first on the scene following Miss Steenkamp's death has raised new questions about the trial.

In Behind the Door, Barry Bateman argues that the prosecution ignored crucial evidence about Miss Steenkamp's final moments.

Ignoring the evidence: Bateman claims that the prosecution ignored evidence about the night of the killing

The evidence hinges on whether or not Miss Steenkamp flushed the toilet in the moments leading up to her death, with Bateman arguing that the noise of the flushing toilet should have alerted Pistorius to his girlfriend's whereabouts.

'With the help of private forensic investigators, we've established Reeva Steenkamp probably flushed the toilet moments before her boyfriend, Oscar Pistorius, shot her,' he explains.

'But neither the state nor the defence presented this flushing – an event in the timeline – as evidence. Why?' 

The crux of the defence case focused on the idea that a terrified Pistorius, fearing an intruder, shot Steenkamp after hearing noises from the bathroom.

Bateman, who hired private investigator Kobus Steyl to look into the question of whether or not the toilet was flushed before Miss Steenkamp was shot, says that the evidence suggests that it was.

'Defence expert Roger Dixon also believed that Steenkamp flushed the toilet, and that this further proved Pistorius' version of events,' explains Bateman. 

'As he said to me, "This was the third startle [fright for Pistorius]. It destroys the state’s case totally. With the third startle, his worst fears are confirmed.'

However Bateman believes that, rather than proving his innocence, Miss Steenkamp flushing the toilet moments before being shot by Pistorius actually raises questions about his story.

Pistorius testified that after hearing the noise in the bathroom, he fetched his firearm and proceeded down the cupboard-lined passage,' he explains.

In his evidence, Pistorius said: 'I started screaming and shouting for the burglar or the intruders to get out of my house. I shouted for Reeva to get down on the floor. 

'I shouted for her to phone the police. I screamed at the people, the persons (sic) to get out.'

According to the athlete, the sound of the toilet door slamming shut was enough to convince him that intruders were indeed in the house.

'I was not sure if someone was going to come out of the toilet to attack me,' he said, while giving evidence during the trial.

'I was not sure if someone was going to come up the ladder and point a firearm in the house and start shooting, so I just stayed where I was and kept on screaming.'

Questions: The issue of whether or not Miss Steenkamp flushed the toilet was ignored by the prosecution

Final act: Sentencing could take several days and follows a trial that lasted for more than three months

'It was at this point Pistorius said he heard a noise from inside the cubicle,' says Bateman. 'He later said he believed was the magazine rack moving, which prompted him to open fire four times.

'But it’s at this point forensic experts believe Steenkamp flushed the toilet. Would she have done so if her boyfriend was just a few arms' lengths away screaming frantically at an intruder to get out of the house and for her to call the police?'

Although Pistorius and his attorney Brian Webber did not respond to Bateman's inquiries, he says prosecution sources admit to leaving the evidence - which could have reinforced the state case against Pistorius - out. 

'While the national prosecuting authority did not respond to questions, a source in the state’s team said prosecutor Gerrie Nel did not introduce this evidence because there were simply too many possibilities to consider,' explains Bateman. 

While Pistorius waits to discover his fate, it seems that questions remain.
