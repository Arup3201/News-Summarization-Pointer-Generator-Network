When Felix Prendergast's pilot father went to war, the one-year-old was yet to take his first steps - but today the toddler excitedly raced down the tarmac to greet him on his return.

Squadron Leader Gareth Prendergast returned to RAF Marham, in Norfolk, after a six month stint flying Tornado fighter bombers over Afghanistan.

His return marks the end of RAF combat operations in the area after ground troops pulled out of Camp Bastion in Helmand province last month.

Mr Prendergast's wife, Rachel, and sons Felix and Hector, three, were at the base awaiting his return.

Mrs Prendergast, from Norfolk, said: 'Hector is old enough to have some understanding of where his dad has been and has missed him terribly.

'It's been different for Felix who wasn't even walking when he went away.

'For Gareth it's like coming back to a different son and I'm sure they'll have a great time bonding all over again.'

Holding his sons, Mr Prendergast, who grew up in Derbyshire, said that being away from family was the hardest part of serving in Afghanistan.

He said: 'You almost form a family of your own while you're out there but of course it's never the same.

Mrs Prendergast said her husband and son would have a 'great time bonding all over again', as so much had changed since he left

Oliver Payne was greeted at the base by his partner Liza Brooks and their puppy Islay, who was 12 weeks old when he left

'I've missed a lot of them growing up but have spoken to them regularly on Skype.

'I can't wait to get home tonight and spend some time with them.'

Tornado crews have served at Kandahar Airfield since 2009 in a combat and reconnaissance role.

Members of 31 Squadron are the last to complete a tour with 170 people due to return over the coming days.

Liza Brooks and fiance Flight Lieutenant Oliver Payne were also reunited.

Miss Brooks brought along six-month-old spaniel Islay.

Mr Payne said: 'Islay was 12 weeks old when I left and she seems a bit nervous around me now - she probably doesn't recognise me.

'It's great to be home and great to see Liza again.'
