A violent mother-of-two who chewed off a love rival's ear in a jealous attack has been jailed for three-and-a-half years.

Disabled Danielle Slater, 33, sat on victim Tammy Baldwin and pulled out 'enormous clumps' of her hair just weeks after writing on Facebook that she would love to see her 'bleeding on the floor'.

Lewes Crown Court in East Sussex heard the victim is now permanently scarred with half her lobe missing.

Evil: Danielle Slater, of Newhaven, East Sussex, bit off the ear of love rival Tammy Baldwin and pulled out enormous clumps of her hair. She has been jailed for three-and-a-half years

She also had to undergo HIV and hepatitis B tests when doctors feared she could have contracted the illnesses after being bitten.

The court was told Slater, known as Danni, chewed through the lobe and cartilage in the attack which took place in Newhaven, East Sussex, on May 5 last year.

Jennifer Gray, prosecuting, said the pair had originally been 'close friends'.

But they fell out after Slater and her then partner's relationship broke down following reports he had been having an affair with chip shop worker Tammy in 2011.

In April last year violent Slater wrote on her Facebook page: 'What I want is you bleeding on the floor while I PMSL (p*** myself laughing).'

The pair bumped into each other in a local pub in Newhaven, where they both live, while out separately with friends and a scuffle began.

When numerous members of the public tried to help Tammy, a friend of housekeeper Slater forced them away.

Miss Gray told the court a taxi driver, named only as Mr Gandhi, saw what happened.

She said: 'He saw the defendant punch her (Tammy) to the floor.

'She sat on her. She could not move at all.

'Miss Baldwin said the pressure of Miss Slater sitting on her meant she could not move at all. She wet herself.

'She said she felt her teeth upon her earring.

'She pulled out several enormous clumps of hair.

'There were kicks to the stomach and her head was bashed against a car.'

Crime scene: The attack happened in the The Ship Hotel in Newhaven

Miss Gray said Tammy had been left with a 'permanent disfiguration' after she got an infection and reconstructive surgery proved unsuitable.

She said: 'She does not like to go out and is very conscious. She cannot wear earrings or her hair up.'

Edmund Fish, defending, said Slater had been provoked after learning her former friend had been with her partner of 18 years.

He said: 'She felt an enormous sense of betrayal.'

Sentencing Slater to three and a half years in jail Judge Michael Lawson said the message was 'chilling'.

He condemned the mum, who admitted grevious bodily harm, for using her teeth as a weapon.

Speaking after the hearing Tammy, who did not attend court, said the situation was still too raw. 'I don't want to gloat,' she added.
