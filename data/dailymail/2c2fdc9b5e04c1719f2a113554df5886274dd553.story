British billionaire financier Alan Howard paid $43million three years ago for a Monet masterpiece that New York prosecutors now allege was pilfered by a former aide to ousted Philippine first lady Imelda Marcos.

The disgraced secretary, Vilma Bautista, is currently on trial on charges that she illegally sold the 1899 painting titled Japanese Footbridge Over Water Lily Pond in Giverny from Mrs Marcos' vast collection, which the Philippine government wants back.

The artwork vanished amid President Ferdinand Marcos’ 1986 overthrow ended up in Bautista’s hands and is part of a multibillion-dollar roster of property the Philippines claims the Marcoses acquired with the nation’s cash, prosecutors said.

But for all the art-world intricacies and Philippine politics, ‘at bottom, this case is really quite simple — it’s about greed and fraud,’ Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Garrett Lynch told jurors in an opening statement last week.

The defense said Bautista believed that Imelda Marcos rightfully owned the painting and that Bautista had authority to sell them for her. Bautista is just an intermediary who got caught up in a decades-long dispute between a nation and its former leader, attorney Susan Hoffinger said.

The debt-ridden Bautista, 74, faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted of conspiracy charges, Yahoo! Finance reported.

Mr Howard, the founder of the highly profitable Brevan Howard Asset Management hedge fund, who according to Forbes boasts a personal net worth of $1.6billion, has found himself embroiled in the controversy after purchasing the painting in 2010 from the London art dealer Hazlitt, Gooden & Fox.

According to The Smoking Gun, the French masterpiece remains in the possession of the Swiss-based 50-year-old financier, who has paid $10millon to a class action group of 10,000 victims of human rights abuses under the Marcos regime 'in exchange for a legal release on any claims regarding the painting.'

Howard's representative said the affluent investor, who relocated to Switzerland several years ago, plans to take legal action against the gallery that sold him the Monet.

The spokesperson also claimed that the 1899 impressionist work was not on the Philippine Presidential Commission on Good Government's original list of missing artworks believed to have been purchased by the corrupt Marcos clan using public funds.

The PPCGG was established in 1986 to recover the funds swindled by Ferdinand Marcos and his greedy spouse, who scandalized the world with her shoe collection and $3,000-a-day New York shopping sprees.

Bautista was a foreign service officer assigned to the Philippine Mission to the United Nations and later served as Imelda Marcos’ New York-based personal secretary and shopper, snapping up luxury Manhattan condominiums and jewelery on behalf of her boss.

According to investigators, Bautista may have illegally taken the Monet along with other artworks after the 1986 popular uprising that removed the Marcoses from power.

She had kept the painting hidden for two decades before putting it on the market in 2009 with the help of her two nephews, who have since fled the U.S.

On her part, the 74-year-old former aide to Imelda Marcos claimed that her employer presented her with the Monet as a gift 20 or 30 years ago.

But it is alleged the paper trail associated with the sale of the painting tells a different story.

Before offloading the piece on the London gallery, which would eventually sell it to Howard, Bautista and her relatives reportedly attempted to sell it the New York-based Acquavella Galleries.

However, the art dealers raised concerns that Miss Bautista had a 19-year-old certificate authorizing her to sell the artwork, and the deal fell through when the former Marcos assistant failed to produce a more recent document.

The prosecution has alleged that the 1991 certificate was a forgery. 

When Bautista and her kin approached Hazlitt, Gooden & Fox through their representatives, the London-based gallery also expressed misgivings about the outdated certificate.

In response, Bautista presented a letter of explanation, which appears to have satisfied the gallery since it sold the Monet to Howard just five days later.

Miss Bautista walked away from the lucrative deal $32.1million richer. Some proceeds went to Bautista’s relatives and to debts; $15million stayed in her bank accounts, while Imelda Marcos knew nothing of the sale, the prosecutor said. 

After ruling the Philippines with an iron fist for two decades, Ferdinand Marcos was forced by a ‘people power’ revolt into exile in Hawaii. He died three years later.

Philippine officials say Marcos and his cronies looted the country’s treasury to amass between $5billion and $1billion. The Marcoses denied their wealth was ill-gotten.

With a massive collection of shoes, Imelda Marcos became a symbol of excess. But she has emerged relatively unscathed from hundreds of legal cases against her and her late husband, and she is now a congresswoman in the Philippines.

She is not expected to testify at Bautista’s trial.

Bautista’s lawyer said the aide sold the painting for Marcos but never had a chance to give her the money.
