A female Air Force veteran has revealed horrifying scars and a catalog of ill health following what she claims was a botched removal of her ovaries allegedly performed by a Veteran's Affairs surgeon.

Robin Temple posted a video online earlier this month with her abdominal and chest scars exposed to show the terrible ordeal she has been through following 13 surgeries in six years.

On the clip, Ms Temple says: 'Hi, my name's Robin Temple and I'm an Air Force veteran and a malpractice survivor from the VA.'

Ms Temple had a ovariectomy in January 2007 which she claims was performed by a VA OBGYN surgeon. However something went catastrophically wrong and a piece of her colon was removed instead.

For three days, Ms Temple claims she was told by the doctor's office that because she has PTSD, her pain following the surgery 'was all in [her] head'.

Ms Temple later became septic and spent time in a coma on life-support.

A follow-up doctor then performed a colectomy to correct the first doctor's mistake.

For 15 months, she traveled several hundred miles to reach the hospital from her home in Maine to attend follow-up appointments because the pain continued.

At one appointment, Ms Temple claims a doctor lifted her shirt in the waiting room and said: 'You're sewed together funny, get over it, you have PTSD.'

Ms Temple's voice trembles on her YouTube clip as she says she was repeatedly told that she was exaggerating her health problems because she was suffering from PTSD.

Later, the Air Force vet discovered she was suffering from two massive hernias and while undergoing an MRI scan to investigate, found that her ovaries had not been removed.

Tragically, the tumors had spread to her lymph nodes in her groin. More surgeries took place.

She then had bladder sheaths implanted which cut her bladder in half and were recalled, leading to more surgery. 

Because she is allergic to penicillin, 
the alternative tetracycline has caused the discoloration of her teeth, Ms Temple claims.  

Her left kidney began to fail due to the amount of medication Ms Temple required and ongoing infections. She lost half of her left kidney.

Ms Temple had a double mastectomy after discovering a lump in her breast and finally, her lymph nodes removed.

Ms Temple told heavy.com: 'I am a jigsaw puzzle.

'I have had 13 surgeries since '07 and counting. I have two more hernias now.

'The only thing holding my guts in is cadaver skin; that's it, and it only last three to five years.

'I'm at the fifth year this January... and where do I live?... I lost my house so I live in a tiny little camper.'

She claims that the government has not taken any responsibility for her botched medical care and instead she is left to fill out paperwork on a daily basis. 

Ms Temple does appear to be mistaken in some of her statements, according to Gawker, including the accusations against one doctor and remarks about 'illegal' overdoses.

She also falsely claims that a pencillin allergy stained her teeth and her statistics about the number of women raped in the military are incorrect.

Fundraising campaigns have been set up for the veteran after her story was shared across social media sites. 

One Reddit user wrote: 'This poor woman.
She's sitting in her bed right now, as we are watching this. We're 
going to go about our days, and she's still going to be there. Waiting. I
hope this gets a lot of attention. Seems like she's been ignored a long
time.'

Ms Temple also claims that while she was on active duty in the Air Force, she was raped by her sergeant but no one would believe her and she was placed in a mental hospital.

She was honorably discharged from service.

MailOnline was awaiting a response from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.
