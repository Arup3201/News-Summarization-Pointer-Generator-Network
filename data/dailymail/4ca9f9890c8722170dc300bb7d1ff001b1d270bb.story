Many people say their commute is like pulling teeth, but Yang Dong has more reason to complain than most.

The 20-year-old gripped a rope between his jaws and pulled a van laden with nine adults - while walking on broken glass.

He began practicing the stunt 10 years ago and now manages to pull a van weighing three tons down the street.

Meanwhile, the road under him was laden with a 13ft carpet of shattered beer bottles.

Mr Yang managed to pull off the feat last week in Fuzhou, a city of 7million people and the capital of south east China's Fujian province.

It is not clear yet if he has set a world record. Last year a man calling himself Montystar A. also pulled a three-tonne truck with his mouth in Haryana, India - though on that occasion broken glass was not involved.

Easy does it: Yang Dong, 20, pulled a three tonne van using a rope gripped between his teeth in Fuzhou, China

Tough job: My Yang practiced for 10 years for the stunt, which involved a 13ft-long carpet of shattered bottles

Glutton for punishment: Mr Yang, 20, rubbed broken glass all over his body before the main event

Pain threshold: Mr Yang's back arched as his mouth took on the strain of pulling the fully-laden minibus

Just a normal day: Despite the unusual nature of the city centre stunt, it attracted surprisingly few onlookers
