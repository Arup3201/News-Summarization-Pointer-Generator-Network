Prince Andrew has admitted he has been a 'fool' over his friendship with billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. 

The Duke of York has found himself at the centre of a sex scandal over allegations he slept with a minor on three separate occasions - in London, New York and the US Virgin Islands - supplied to him by the paedophile. 

The fifth in line to the throne has 'emphatically denied' the bombshell allegations made by Virginia Roberts, but has now said he deeply regrets becoming involved with Epstein.

The Duke of York, 54, has gone further than before in expressing regret at his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein

The Duke had previously said he had made an 'error of judgement' when he was snapped strolling through New York's Central Park in 2011 with Epstein following his release from jail. 

But now he is gone even further in expressing his regret for the ill-advised friendship. 

A source close to the Duke told the Sunday Telegraph: 'It would be crass and disingenuous to suggest he has been unaffected by this.

'He is watching the news and reading the headlines and even though the friendship with Jeffrey Epstein was acknowledged as being unwise back in 2011, the Duke has clearly had a long time this week for the consequences of that friendship to further sink in. More than ever, he can see how foolish it was.' 

He has also admitted he cannot go to court to clear his name as he is 'mindful he has already got himself in to unprecedented territory'.

This is in contrast to Epstein's lawyer Alan Dershowitz who is counter-suing and urging the Duke to do likewise.

He said: 'The story is totally made up. I don't know this woman, It is part of a pattern of made-up stories against prominent people and world leaders.

'I think it must be presumed all her allegations against Prince Andrew were false as well.  

'You cannot allow these allegations to hang above you. The first question you have to ask yourself when you are charged with a crime like this is "Is there any conceivable possibility you did it?" and if the answer to that is "no", you have to fight back with every resource and ounce of energy available to you.'

Epstein was convicted in a plea bargain deal of one count of soliciting underage prostitution and is now a registered level one sex offender after serving an 18-month prison sentence

The extraordinary allegations made by Roberts, now a 30-year-old married mother with three children, are part of a US civil case against Epstein.

Roberts claims Prince Andrew had sex with her when she was 17 - a minor under US law - and was employed as a 'sex slave' by Epstein. They were introduced, she claims, through Ghislaine Maxwell, who acted as a 'madame' for the girl. Ms Maxwell denies the allegations. 

One picture, said to have been taken by Epstein during Andrew's first encounter with the girl in March 2001 shows the Prince with his arm around her waist as Maxwell looks on.

Roberts claims that she was told by Epstein 'to give the Prince whatever he demanded and report back to him on the details of the sexual abuse.' 

Epstein was convicted in a plea bargain deal of one count of soliciting underage prostitution and is now a registered level one sex offender after serving an 18-month prison sentence.

But the scandal re-emerged as Roberts added her name to a case trying to overturn Epstein's plea bargain.

Epstein's home in the US Virgin Islands where it is alleged Prince Andrew had sex with Virginia Roberts 

Last night Virginia's aunt Carol Roberts Kess, a devout Mormon who helped raise her, spoke for the first time to tell how terrified Virginia fled her Florida home several months ago amid fears of reprisals from billionaire Epstein and his rich and powerful friends.

'She knew these court papers were coming out so she packed up and fled,' Carol said.

'She is frightened for her life. She has angered a lot of powerful and very rich people. Who knows what they could do?'

Carol, the sister of Virginia's father Sky, said her niece is now living in a ranch 'in the middle of nowhere' in Colorado with her husband and three young children.

'She doesn't feel safe,' retired teacher Carol added.

'There are too many powerful people involved and she is saying things they don't want made public.

'Virginia was living a happy life in Florida but she packed up and left because she knew this was coming and was scared for her own life and that of her family.

'Just before she left she told me she wouldn't be able to contact any family members for a while – for our own safety. She said, 'It's for the best. I don't want to put anyone in danger.' 

In a previous statement released through her lawyers, she said: 'I'm not going to be bullied back in to silence.'   

The Duke, 54, returned from his skiing holiday in Verbier, Switzerland, last week - it emerged yesterday that he has purchased the seven-bedroom ski chalet that he stayed in for as much as £13million 

The Duke, 54, returned from his skiing holiday last week and has since remained at his home at the Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park. 

His next royal engagement is due to take place on January 21, when is set to appear at the World Economic Forum at Davos, in Switzerland. 

It emerged yesterday that the Duke and Duchess of York, his former wife, have splashed out on a seven-bedroom ski chalet in Verbier, Switzerland, for £13million.  

Although the couple divorced in 1996 after 10 years of marriage, they remained on good terms as they raised their two daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, and the duchess lives in the family home of Royal Lodge in Berkshire.
