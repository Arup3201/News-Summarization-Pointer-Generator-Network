The wife of disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner has revealed how unconditional love from her boss Hillary Clinton helped her through her husband's sexting scandal.

Huma Abedin, who started working for Clinton when she was 21 and remains a top aide, was pregnant when it emerged in 2011 that her husband had sent lewd pictures to a string of women.

But the couple weathered the storm and his resignation, and in a lengthy article in New York Times Magazine, Abedin has explained how the support she received at work helped her get through.

'What I will say about [Hillary], 
and for that matter her entire family, the unconditional love and 
support they have given me has been a real gift,' she told the Times.

'And I think she would 
be O.K. with me saying this, because I know she has said this before: at
 the end of the day, at the very least, every woman should have the 
ability and the confidence and the choice to make whatever decisions she
 wants to make that are right for her and not be judged by it.'

The situation echoes Clinton's own personal life and her decision to stick by her husband, and Weiner himself likened his relationship to the Clintons' when the Monica Lewinsky affair came to light.

'If you read Hillary's biography of the time,' he said in the interview, 'she speaks pretty frankly about believing that there were people out to get her husband - "I believe him, I'm going to stand in there, I'm going to tell friends that it’s bull" - and the way she felt when she found out the truth.'

Abedin, 37, speaks about this rollercoaster of emotions - from when she first heard he was accused of sending pictures to women to when he came clean.

At first 'I was right there with him: "Let’s 
fight! Defend!"' she said. 'I was with him. One hundred percent.'

But as the intensity of accusations and calls from reporters grew, he decided to come clean to Abedin during a trip to the Hamptons.

'It was
 every emotion that one would imagine,' she said. 'Rage and anger and shock. But 
more than anything else, in the immediate, it was disbelief. The thing 
that I consciously remember saying over and over and over again is: "I 
don't understand. What is going on? What's happening to our lives?"'

Two days later, she headed on a week-long trip to Africa on Clinton's plane. While aboard, her phone rang and someone at the White House said: 'We are here for you, and we love you.'

When she arrived in Abu Dhabi, Clinton's chief of staff revealed they had also helped fly in her mother and older brother to support her throughout the trip.

Return? Former U.S. Congressman Anthony Weiner revealed he is considering running for New York mayor

On returning, Weiner resigned and they focused on their marriage.

Abedin said that despite her feelings of betrayal, she loved her husband and the friendship they had shared for many years.

'Here was a man I respected, I loved, was
 the father of this child inside of me, and he was asking me for a 
second chance,' she remembered.

'It took a long 
time to be able to sit on a couch next to Anthony and say, "O.K., I 
understand and I forgive". It was the right choice for me. I didn't make
 it lightly.'

The 
couple is now working towards the future - bringing up their son Jordan 
as Weiner considers entering the New York mayor race this year.

He told the magazine that he wants to ask his supporters for a second chance and 'it's now or maybe never'.

Weiner said that the results from the polling by Obama's longtime pollster  David Binder showed that he would have a tough time.

'David said I'd be the underdog in any race I ran,' he said.

Weiner had been a mayoral frontrunner 
before he left his job and still has $4.3 million left in his campaign 
account.

But
 he was forced to step down in June 2011, when he mistakenly posted a 
'crotch shot' on his Twitter feed. It later emerged he had been sending 
lewd images to numerous young women.

The seven-term Democrat initially 
claimed both his Twitter and Facebook accounts had been hacked but later
 admitted he had sexted six women in an emotionally charged press 
conference.

Porn actress Ginger Lee, Las Vegas 
blackjack dealer Lisa Weiss and Megan Broussard, a 26-year-old single 
mother from Texas, were among the women who claimed they had his photos.

He and Ms Abedin, a longtime personal
 aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, were married for less than a
 year when the photos were discovered.

It
 is not the first time Weiner has been said to be plotting a return to 
public life. Previous reports said he was planning to run for 
comptroller or public advocate.
