An army of Islamic State terrorists has advanced to the outskirts of Vienna, Spain has cut off routes to Gibraltar and Nigel Farage – prime minister of 'Great England' – has deported all immigrants who have arrived in the past ten years.

This, according to the BBC, is what the world would be like if the European Union were to collapse.

The apocalyptic vision of a continent in which social order has broken down – to be screened on BBC4 tonight at 10pm – has been condemned by Eurosceptic critics as 'scaremongering'.

Calamity: The Great European Disaster Movie, according to the BBC, is what the world would be like if the European Union were to collapse

The 75-minute film shows what the supposedly impartial broadcaster suggests might happen should the EU implode, and depicts the final days of the European dream as it turns into a nightmare of worthless currencies and predictions of even darker days to come.

The BBC describes The Great European Disaster Movie as an 'authored documentary', but the film – which features comedian Angus Deayton as an archaeologist struggling to explain what the single currency was to a young girl sitting next to him on a plane – has been criticised as a hyped-up piece of pro-EU propaganda.

Horrifying images of concentration camp victims are interspersed with wartime footage of devastated cities, while commentary is provided by former Economist editor Bill Emmott, who made the film with Italian journalist Annalisa Piras.

The terrifying sequence of events ends with Angela Merkel resigning as European Council president and overseeing a vote to abolish the EU. In his commentary, Mr Emmott admits immigration imposes financial burdens on nations but insists that in the long term it creates the resources needed to maintain a welfare state.

In the film, the girl – apparently being deported from Britain because she has an Italian mother – asks Angus Deayton about pictures of bridges on an old euro banknote.

He tells her: 'They were supposed to symbolise unity, unification, all the countries being connected. It was a great idea but unfortunately it didn't work.'

'Faction': The BBC describes The Great European Disaster Movie as an 'authored documentary', but the film has been criticised as a hyped-up piece of pro-EU propaganda.

Mr Emmott and Ms Piras say the film expresses their personal views and is intended to provoke debate. But last night it was condemned by Tory eurosceptic MP Sir Bill Cash as 'scaremongering'.

He said: 'It would be much better if the BBC provided us with a proper analysis of what has gone wrong with European structures.' 

And Tory MEP Daniel Hannan said: 'This is typical of the pro-EU side. They make such ludicrous claims they make themselves look ridiculous.'

Tonight's broadcast will be followed by a discussion by a panel of guests including Mail on Sunday columnist Peter Hitchens and Ukip MP Mark Reckless.

A BBC spokesman said: 'BBC editorial guidelines do not prevent the commissioning of programmes which approach subjects from a particular perspective.'

And Mr Emmott said: 'It's a warning of what could happen if Europe continues on its current path.'

Comment by PETER HITCHENS 

Even the BBC sometimes grasps that it has gone too far. And 11 days ago, it went into a five-star panic over its plan to show a more-or-less crazy pro-EU film tonight.

I assume that, spooked by the derisive reaction to its laughable pro-Labour drama A Casual Vacancy, its chiefs suddenly realised that they had another embarrassment on their hands. The planned transmission was abruptly cut by several minutes, losing a large chunk about the migration wave across the Mediterranean.

And this helped make space for a post-programme discussion, heavily loaded with critics of the European Union, including me, former Chancellor Norman Lamont and Ukip MP Mark Reckless. This is really a figleaf to cover its naked bias, as you will see when you watch it tonight.

I took part because it seemed silly to miss any opportunity to make the case for British independence.

I'm very happy for Bill Emmott to make as many films as he likes for the BBC about the wonders of the EU.

The trouble is, you cannot imagine the Corporation giving anyone the chance to make a film about how miserable it will be if Britain stays in, and how good it will be if we leave.

For this programme is blatant propaganda. And the only cause for joy is that it's not very good propaganda. A doomed plane is zig-zagging across a divided, blacked-out Europe, bearing Angus Deayton and a little girl who has supposedly been deported from a xenophobic, cruel England because her mother isn't paid enough.

This provides the excuse for a patronising series of lecturettes from Mr Deayton. Everything about it is run through with the stupid, ill-informed prejudices of the BBC. Opponents of the EU are portrayed as 'anti-European' nostalgists and haters of abroad. Opponents of immigration are portrayed as dislikers of immigrants. Things which are the EU's own fault, such as its self-inflicted economic crisis, are not blamed on the EU. Wild fantasies are explored in which a British departure causes everyone else to leave – though why they would, if it is so wonderful, I cannot tell.

Baseless guff, about how the EU has brought peace, is repeated unquestioned. In fact, to the extent that it has had any influence on war and peace, the EU has brought war, most recently thanks to its aggressive push into Ukraine.

Winston Churchill's Zurich speech of 1946, which it partly quotes, is a plea for continental Europe to unite, with Britain, the USA and the USSR acting as outside sponsors. Oh, and the Berlin airport for which the fictitious plane is originally bound closed in 2008, as anyone who knows Europe would be aware.
