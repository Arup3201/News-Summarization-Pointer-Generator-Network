A mother whose toddler son was mauled to death by her babysitter’s dogs has told how she has forgiven her - because she 'doesn’t want to lose a friend as well as a son'.

Daxton Borchardt was 14 months old when he was killed by Susan Iwicki’s pet pitbulls, Penny and Boss, while she was looking after him while his parents Kim and Jeff, from East Troy, Wisconsin, went out.

The toddler, affectionately known as Dax, was in 30-year-old Miss Iwicki’s arms when the animals viciously leapt up and dragged him down on to the floor, attacking him.

Dax was fatally injured. Covered in blood, he was raced to hospital, but died three hours later.

Miss Iwicki was also hurt trying to fight off the dogs. At first, Jeff and Kim said they hated Miss Iwicki, who was not charged with any offences over the incident in March 2013.

Mrs Borchardt described how she felt when she learnt her son was dead. 'In that moment I hated Susan and hated her dogs,' the 39-year-old said.

'I screamed at her, "Why was Dax near them? How did they get to him?" .

'Afterwards, the days, weeks and months passed in a sad blur. Susan sent a card which I looked at, but I didn’t contact her. She didn’t come to his funeral, which was packed.'

Before the incident, the Borchardts and Miss Iwicki had been close. After Dax was born in December 2011, Miss Iwicki regularly babysat. 

'Susan was totally smitten with him,' she recalled. 'Dax was your typical little boy. He was interested in absolutely everything and always up to mischief. When he learnt to walk at ten months you couldn’t leave him alone for a minute. He loved pulling things off shelves and clambering over to bookcases. 

'I knew I was biased because I was his mum, but Dax was a real looker. He had huge eyes, a cheeky grin and fluffy dark hair.'

Mrs Borchardt worked in a suburb of Milwaukee, and Mr Borchardt worked as a DJ at night and helped Miss Iwicki’s boyfriend lay carpets in the day, so Dax was looked after by Miss Iwicki. 

'He loved it there,' Mrs Borchardt recalled. 'She had two little chinchillas, Poe and Raven, and Dax adored them. He would stare at them for hours. But I knew she kept Boss and Penny away from Dax because Jeff had asked her to. I knew she looked after the dogs but Dax was so little and they were so big.'

Mrs Borchardt recalled the last time she saw her son alive. 'On March 5, 2013, when Dax was 14 months, he fell asleep while eating his evening meal,' she said. 'Laughing at how silly he looked face down in his tea, I thought about how much I loved him. 

'The next day I got up extra early because it was really snowy and I wanted to take the drive to work slowly.' Mr Borchardt dropped their son off at Miss Iwicki and  went to work. Shortly afterwards Dax was attacked by the dogs and flown by air ambulance to Milwaukee Children’s Hospital. 

Mrs Borchardt continued: 'I’d been at work as an accountant a few hours when I got a call from the police. They said he’d been bitten by a dog. I wasn’t sure how it had happened because the chinchillas were harmless and the big dogs weren’t supposed to be anywhere near him.' 

She met her husband at the hospital and learnt what had happened. 'The doctors told me it wasn’t good news and led me to a quiet room,' she said. 'When the doctors said they’d lost him I was shell-shocked, I didn’t speak. I went to see him and whispered "I love you, I’m so sorry I wasn’t there for you".'

But it was months before she started to forgive Miss Iwicki – and after the anniversary of Dax’s death before she was able to see her again. She said: 'We both began to realise that she had not intended for Dax to be killed, had not realised how dangerous her dogs could be.

'So we invited her to be part of Daxton’s Friends, a charity we were launching to educate people about pitbulls. People asked if I would be OK but I was adamant. I needed to see her so she knew it was OK.

'I knew it wouldn’t change how I felt about Dax. Even so looking at her for the first time wasn’t easy when she came to our first meeting. When we first saw each other we hugged and she said she was sorry. Now we are working together to encourage proper pet care and reduce the number of dog-related incidents. 

'Losing Dax was the worst thing that could have happened to me. I won’t lose my friend as well as my son,' she said.

Speaking after the incident, Susan, pictured left, said: 'I began to think that maybe this wasn't the case and that perhaps pitbulls shouldn’t be kept as pets'

Miss Iwicki, 32, of Fontana, Wisconsin, said: 'The dogs were allowed in the house but never when Dax was there. Although they had never been violent, they were strong dogs, could knock him over. I wouldn’t have wanted that to happen.'

Recounting the day of his death, she said: 'One dog stood on my throat so I couldn’t reach Dax. There was blood everywhere. 

'I spoke to the police and they cleared me of any blame, but I blamed myself. I didn’t blame Kim and Jeff for blaming me. My dogs, who I agreed should be put down, had killed their son. I’d cared for Boss and Penny and always believed that dangerous dogs were the fault of the owner. 

'But I began to think that maybe this wasn’t the case and that perhaps pitbulls shouldn’t be kept as pets.'

Describing the first time she saw Mrs Borchardt, she said: 'Losing Dax has left a huge gap in our lives. We aren’t the same people we were. But thanks to the power of friendship and a shared aim we’ve overcome terrible tragedy and are friends again.'

Fatal pit bull attacks involving children and adults alike have been on the rise in recent years.

In 2011, seven children five years old and younger were mauled to death by dogs of that breed nationwide, along with 15 adults.

In 2012, a total of 23 Americans were killed by pit bulls, including nine children, the youngest of them, Makayala Darnell, was only three days old.

Of all the fatalities that year, 34 per cent involved more than one dog.

So far this year, at least four people were killed by dogs, all of them pit bulls.

Among the most recent victims were four-year-old Christian Gormanous, age four, and Isaiah Aguilar, age two, both from Texas.

In the eight-year period from 2005 to 2012, pit bulls and Rottweilers, the second most lethal breed, accounted for 73 per cent of the total 251 recorded deaths.

Pit bulls make up less than 5 per cent of the total US dog population.
