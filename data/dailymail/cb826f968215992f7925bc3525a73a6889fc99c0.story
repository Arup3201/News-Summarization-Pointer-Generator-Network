Javier Mascherano believes Barcelona have given their youngsters 'the best quality of life' after the club's transfer ban for signing underage players was upheld.

The Catalan giants failed with an appeal against FIFA's decision to stop them buying players for two transfer windows after they were found guilty of breaching article 19.

Mascherano refused to be drawn on the legal proceedings surrounding the decision, but did stick up for Barca's handling of young talent.

High praise: Barcelona midfielder Javier Mascherano believes the club give their young players 'the best quality of life'

Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, the former Liverpool midfielder said: 'It is a very delicate situation for me to be giving opinions on because I don't know the issue of the law in any great depth.

'We are dedicated to football and we try to do it in the best way. In a personal manner, I can say that the club have worked and taken good care of the guys in La Masia - that is what you can see.

'I know that today many children have passed through the club. One sees that the club have given them the best quality of life here. That is what I can say, the rest is down to legal issues.'

Mascherano, who recently signed a new four-year contract at the Nou Camp, is ready to fulfil any role given to him by new manager Luis Enrique next season.

He added: 'I came here four years ago and my role has not changed. I must be a team player and go wherever the coach or the team need me to play.

'That will always remain the case because it is my way of thinking. The coach knows he can count on me for anything and it was an easy decision for me to commit.

'I told the club I would leave if they needed me to, but they decided it was best for both parties that I stayed and here I am.'
