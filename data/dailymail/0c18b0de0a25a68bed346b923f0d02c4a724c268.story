The budget for the High Speed 2 railway linking London to the Midlands has increased by nearly £10 billion because of the addition of a tunnel to plans, the Transport Secretary has told MPs.

Ahead of an expected rebellion by Conservative MPs, Patrick McLoughlin said the £42.6billion budget also included a large contingency fund. The original budget had been about £33billion.

The Government argues the highly controversial HS2 will help to bridge the North-South divide by cutting journey times and fuelling economic growth in the Midlands and North.

The budget for the High Speed 2 railway has increased by nearly £10 billion to more than £40 billion partly because of the addition of a tunnel to plans, the Transport Secretary has told MPs

It hopes the first stage of the project, between London and Birmingham, would start in 2017 and finish in 2026. The second stage, to Manchester and Leeds, would be completed by 2033.

HS2 Ltd has previously said the tunnel would run between Castle Bromwich Business Park and the eastern edge of Washwood Heath, the BBC reports.

Original plans involved using the existing Derby to Birmingham railway line before running under the M6 Bromford Viaduct.

The first phase is now budgeted at 
£21.4 billion and the second phase at £21.2 billion, and includes a 
£12.7 billion contingency fund across the scheme.

Mr McLoughlin said: 'I will be writing tomorrow to the chairman of HS2 to set a target price for the delivery of phase of the project. That is £17 billion at 2011 prices. This takes account of the design and environmental changes to improve the scheme.

'There was the point in relation to the Olympic Games - a contingency was allowed and actually the price of the Games came in below the price that had been set by the Government.

'While I expect the final costs to be lower than those I have just outlined... this is the right way to plan the project.'

The increased costs are a reflection of changes to the route, including a tunnel under the M6 at Birmingham, and an increased contingency fund.

The revelations came as MPs debated the High Speed Rail (Preparation) Bill at second reading, proposals which pave the way for the development and planning of the line and allows spending by the Department for Transport to get the project up and running.

Patrick McLoughlin said the £42.6 billion budget also included a large contingency fund

Mr McLoughlin said: 'It is very important we are seen as being able to compete with other countries in the global race to attract businesses to this country.

'I am going to be very open with the House and put all this into the (public) domain... I want to be as open as I possibly can.'

The Transport Secretary faced a series of questions from his own benches about compensation and mitigation for the scheme and said he had 'respect and understanding' for objections.

But he defended the project as being essential for Britain’s future growth.

'The easiest thing in the world for the Government to do would be not to build HS2,' Mr McLoughlin said.

'But the cost of doing that would be huge. It would be a cost in jobs - our modest estimates are HS2 will create and support 100,000 jobs, while the group of core cities predict HS2 will underpin 400,000 jobs, 70 per cent of them outside London.

'It would be a cost in prosperity - some estimates suggest HS2 will add over £4 billion to the economy even before it is open and the line is estimated to provide around £50 billion worth of economic benefits once it is up and running.

'If we don’t go ahead with HS2, there will also be a cost in lost opportunities for the towns and the cities in the Midlands and the North.

'I’m not prepared to put up with a situation where you can get to Brussels on a high speed train line but not to Birmingham. Where you can get to Strasbourg on high speed trains but not to Sheffield. To Lille but not to Leeds.

'We cannot afford to leave the economic future of our great cities... to an overcrowded 200 year old railway.'

Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom (South Northamptonshire) questioned the cost-benefit analysis of the HS2 project, given the increased costs.

Intervening, she said: 'Could you explain what the £12.7 billion of contingency will do to the benefit-cost ratio, because certainly during the consultation period, it was always made clear the £32 billion was the absolute maximum and contained a vast sum for contingency?'

Mr McLoughlin explained: 'I would point out the amount of benefit-cost ratio (BCR) is reckoned to be 2.5 - I also point that BCR does tell us some things but it doesn’t tell us everything.

The Government argues the highly controversial HS2 will help to bridge the North-South divide by cutting journey times and fuelling economic growth in the Midlands and North

'For instance, BCR on the Jubilee (London Underground) Line was a lot lower than it is for HS2. Actually, if the Jubilee Line had not been developed, a lot of the development we now see down in Canary Wharf would not have taken place. That brought a huge amount of investment into the area and into the country.'

Labour MP Natascha Engel (North East Derbyshire) urged the Transport Secretary to commit to publishing receipts for expenditure under the Bill before MPs today.

The High Speed Rail (Preparation) Bill does not green-light spending on the main project but allowed for 'preparatory expenditure' by the Secretary of State.

Mr McLoughlin said he was committed to transparency and Parliamentary scrutiny but said he could only look at Ms Engel’s request, rather than agree from the outset.

Mr McLoughlin said the coalition was considering a number of compensation schemes for residents affected by the planned rail line, including a possible 'property bond'.

British businesses would benefit from the projects, he added.

'On building HS2 we also need to ensure that we make the best use of British skills and workers,' said Mr McLoughlin, adding that 97per cent of Crossrail contracts had been awarded to British-based companies.

He said: 'From 2017, HS2 will create 19,000 engineering and construction jobs.'
