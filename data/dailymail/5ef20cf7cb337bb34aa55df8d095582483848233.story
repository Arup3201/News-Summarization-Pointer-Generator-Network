If you lived in a place with a Dull church, a Dull war memorial and a Dull Highland Adventure Safari would you fancy a trip to a town featuring Boring pubs and Boring restaurants?

That's what lies in store for the residents of the small settlement of Dull in Scotland as the community gears up to formally link with the town of Boring situated in the U.S. some 5,542 miles away.

A bond has been formed between the Scottish village near Aberfeldy in Perthshire and the equally unexciting sounding town in Oregon following talks between Dull and Weem Parish Council and Boring Community Planning Organisation.

Drive through: The town of Boring in Oregon, U.S. and the village of Dull in Scotland have forged a common bond over the uninspiring names of the settlements

The idea of bringing the two places together emerged after Elizabeth Leighton, from Grandtully, in Perthshire, passed through the U.S. town while on a cycling holiday.

She then decided to share the news of her exciting discovery with her Dull friend Emma Burtles and chairman of the Boring Community Planning Organisation Steve Bates.

Mr Bates was interested in exploring the possibility of developing a relationship between Dull and Boring and he put together a plan to invite those living in Dull to take on 'Sister Community' status when Boring Planning Organisation meets in June.

Exciting times: They may be more than 9,000 miles apart but the communities of Dull and Boring are set to become close friends

Confirming the move, Dull community councillor Marjorie Keddie received a 'Declaration of Sistership' from the logging town in Oregon on Thursday.

Speaking at last week’s community council meeting, Mrs Keddie said: 'It might seem like a joke, but this could have real benefits for Dull.

'Everyone has been smiling at the prospect of the very eye-catching road sign this will inevitably require. 'It will be interesting to see where this goes.'

Name game: The town of Boring (right) is too big to formally twin with Dull in Scotland (left) but Dull could become a sister community or Boring

Boring is too large when compared with Dull to qualify for official twinning status, but the two communities are hoping to create a close bond.

Community council chairman Tommy Pringles joked: 'We might experience traffic incidents when people see the sign by the road.

'It’s bad enough when people stop dead to photograph the signpost for Dull.

'Imagine how many people would do a double-take if it said Welcome to Dull, a Sister Community of Boring?'
