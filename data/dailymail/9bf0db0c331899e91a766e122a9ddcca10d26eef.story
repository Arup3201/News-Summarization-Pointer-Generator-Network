A true eco-warrior has put her own spin on the bridal tradition of wearing something old and something new by growing her own wedding dress out of old tree mulch and fungus - and now she wants other brides to do the same.

Erin Smith, a former artist in residence at Microsoft Research who lives in New York City, used a $40 bag of agricultural waste from Ecovative Design to grow mycelium, a mass of fibers from microscopic mushrooms, to create the 'fabric' for her dress, with the intention of wearing her unique, yet cardboard-like design to her nuptials in Vermont last August.  

'I like the [idea] that maybe you change into something else for dancing, and you could literally tear the dress apart and put it in your garden, and it would literally keep growing with you,' she told the Huffington Post.

She added: 'There’s something kind of of lovely about that.' 

In order to mold the mushroom material into the shape of a gown, she wrapped the sheets of mycelium around a dress form where they continued to grow.

Erin said that her mom 'rolled her eyes' when she found out that her daughter was planning to wear a homegrown dress to say 'I do', but she wasn't particularly surprised.

Despite her best intentions however, the artist ended up walking down the aisle in a thrift store dress because her dress wasn't entirely finished growing.

But Erin insisted that she is still interested in the concept of growing wedding dresses and noted that she would like to one day create a thinner and more malleable mycelium for making clothing, including bridal gowns.

Circle of life: Erin said she liked the idea that a bride could tear the dress apart and put in her garden as compost 

Clothing of the future: The dress is an example of taking a one time use object and turning it into something that is biodegradable immediately after use

'I think the ability for us to grow our own clothing could have great positive potential,' she told The Guardian. 

According to Erin, growing clothing would eliminate carbon emissions and allow people to make garments with precise dimensions and specifications.'

'The concept behind a grown wedding dress was to take a one-time-use object and rethink its construction in order to have an appropriate material lifespan,' she said. 

Erin noted that the average cost of a wedding gown in the US is about $1,200 and made out of nearly 12 yards of fabric.

'The wedding dress is a perfect example of a one-time-use, energy intensive and entirely non-sustainable model that is representative of so many of the choices that we make daily,' she said.
