A guide dog died after pushing a four-year-old child out of harm’s way from a speeding car that ran a stop sign in Atlanta, Georgia, on Monday.

Dave Furukawa, the visually-impaired owner of the 80-pound black boxer, was walking his son, Will, to school when the accident happened.

As they crossed Brownwood Avenue in southeast Atlanta, witnesses saw a red Chrysler run a stop sign and strike Simon, the guide dog, then Furukawa.

Hero: Simon, the guide dog, died after he pushed a 4-year-old boy out of the path of a car that ran a stop sign

Sad: The dog's owner, Dave Furukawa, misses his canine companion

Happy family: Furukawa and his son, Will, and Simon snuggle up together a few years ago.

They said that Simon's protective instinct kicked in, despite injuries that would prove to be fatal.

‘Simon either got up or jumped out, and pushed my son out of the path of the car,’ Furukawa told WXIA.

'This was true loyalty and courage,' he added. 'He loved my son.'

Bystanders took Will and ran him down the street to the family home.

And while Simon was dying from internal bleeding, the faithful dog still followed them home to make sure the child and his owner were safe.

‘Broken leg, gash on his side and internal bleeding, but he followed home,’ said Furukawa.

‘Once he was sure Will was okay, he laid down.’

Family members rushed Simon to an emergency vet clinic, but the boxer died on the way.

Atlanta police say the driver, Calvin Armour, was cited with running a stop sign and failing to yield to pedestrians in the crosswalk.

Pilot Dogs, Inc., of Columbus, Ohio, provided Simon to Furukawa and said they will give Furukawa another guide dog and training.

Furukawa was hospitalised with a broken elbow, knee and heel and is recovering. His son, Will, was unhurt in the incident.
