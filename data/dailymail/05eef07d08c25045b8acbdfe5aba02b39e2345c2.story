She may have found fame on The Only Way Is Essex but Lauren Pope, 32, is proving to be a serious force to be reckoned with in the fashion industry.

The TOWIE star has seen her clothing line go from strength to strength, landed herself a modelling contract and was even voted more fashionable that the Duchess of Cambridge.

Now, the DJ and entrepreneur has unveiled a new accessories range for Accessoryo.com - and poses in a slick, high fashion shoot to showcase her designs.

Lauren Pope, who found fame on The Only Way Is Essex, has seen her clothing line go from strength to strength and now she's ventured into designing an accessories range for Accessoryo.com

Speaking to FEMAIL about her new range of sunglasses and statement totes, which are all priced under £60, Lauren said: 'I tend to look to street style photography online and stalk fashion bloggers like Chiara Ferragni, Shea Maria, Kristina Bazan and Vanessa Hong for ideas.

'Celebrity-wise I look to Nicole Richie, Kate Bosworth and Jamie Chung. I took elements of all these styles when working on the collection and hopefully you will see all of these elements in the range.'

Lauren, a self-confessed Olsen twin fan, looked to Mary-Kate and Ashley when garnering inspiration for the collection. In fact, the large circular 70s style pair of sunglasses, which she says will be a summer staple of hers, were inspired by the fashionable twins.

The star, who also has her own hair extension range with countless celebrity fans, thinks her style has matured naturally over the years.

She said: 'I think it evolved as I headed towards my thirties. My interest in style and fashion started to grow and from there I started to take a genuine interest in what I wore and how I wore it.'

Her foray into fashion has paid off - she was snapped up by Elite Models last year and says having an established agency who want to work with her towards long-term goals is a 'great confidence boost'. 

Speaking candidly about her insecurities growing up, she said: 'In my twenties I was very insecure about the way I looked and silly trolls on social media would tell me I was ugly and wasn't as attractive as the other TOWIE girls. 

'To be able to finally embrace the way I look has has been very liberating.'

With a successful brand to her name and the respect of the fashion world, it seems the future is bright for Lauren.

Over the next few years she plans on channeling 'empowered, positive women who are the boss of their own business empire and running things on their own terms' like Natalie Massenet, Michelle Mone and Elle Macpherson.

'In five years time, hopefully I'll be settled with a family of my own and continuing to work on building my business empire,' she said.

'I work incredibly hard on all the behind the scenes goings on of everything I'm involved in and I'm always learning and taking on new challenges. I love every single minute of it and that will continue long past the next five years.'
