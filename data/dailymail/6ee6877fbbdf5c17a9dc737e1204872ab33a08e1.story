Arrested: Abu Qatada has been arrested for allegedly breaching his bail conditions hours after his home was raided by counter-terror police

Abu Qatada was back in jail last night over fears the terror suspect was trying to communicate with associates, in breach of bail conditions.

Qatada had his bail revoked by a senior judge in an emergency hearing, following a raid on his home.

The judge said there was ‘strong evidence’ the Islamist cleric had breached strict bail terms by allowing mobile phones to be switched on at his North-West London house or letting electronic storage devices such as memory sticks be brought inside.

Security sources said the investigation had implications for national security but declined to say if Qatada had been trying to contact known jihadists.

Mr Justice Irwin ruled that Qatada be taken to high-security Belmarsh prison last night, ahead of a further hearing in the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) next week.

The decision will be seen as a boost to Home Secretary Theresa May – who broke the news during her speech to Tory party activists yesterday – ahead of another attempt in her long-running bid to send Qatada back to Jordan.

Granted asylum in 1994, Qatada, 52, has since been described as Osama Bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe and is feared to have inspired a generation of terrorists.

A secret MI5 dossier revealed last year by The Mail on Sunday claimed he had ordered ‘jihad’ against British and US citizens in the wake of 9/11.

However, UK security services have never found enough evidence to charge him.

Qatada has been found guilty of terrorism offences in his absence in Jordan. But SIAC ruled Jordan had not proved Qatada’s retrial would be free of evidence obtained by torture.

Mrs May will challenge this decision in front of three Appeal Court judges on Monday.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police Service Counter Terrorism unit said: 'There was material before SIAC suggesting he had breached his bail conditions.

As part of the 25 conditions, Qatada has a 22-hour home curfew.

Banned from attending a mosque or leaving a small area near his house.

He is not allowed a mobile phone, internet connection or more than one bank account and only vetted visitors can visit his home.

Banned from publishing any statement, leading prayers other than for those in his own family Cannot arrange to meet people outside his home without Home Office permission.

'There will be a further hearing in 
the matter on March 21, giving both sides the opportunity to submit more
evidence in the matter.'

In
his ruling, Mr Justice Irwin said there was 'strong prima facie 
evidence' that Qatada had breached a bail condition which prohibits him 
from having mobile telephones switched on in his house while he is 
present.

It also bans 
communications equipment such as digital media devices, re-writable CDs 
and pen drives being brought into his house.

Further consideration of bail will be brought before SIAC on Thursday March 21, he added.

A
Home Office spokesman said: 'We are pleased the Special Immigration 
Appeals Commission has decided to revoke bail for this individual on an 
interim basis following serious breaches of his bail conditions.

'We will vigorously argue our case at the next hearing on March 21.'

Officers
completed searches at four properties today in connection with ongoing 
inquiries by the Counter Terrorism Command but found no hazardous 
materials, Scotland Yard said.

No arrests have been made in connection with the police investigation.

Qatada, who has been convicted of terror charges in Jordan, is due to appear at the Court of Appeal on Monday for Home Secretary Theresa May's bid to overturn a judge's decision to allow him to stay in the UK.

The arrest came after Qatada’s house had been raided by specialist officers from the Metropolitan Police’s Counter Terrorism Command on Thursday.

Officers carried bags of evidence from the 52-year-old’s £450,000 North London home after a 12-hour search.

The Al Qaeda fanatic, once described as Osama Bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe, was released from jail in February 2012 on condition of abiding by some of the strictest bail restrictions possible under English law.

He has so far received more than 
£500,000 in legal aid in his decade-long legal battle against the 
Government, which wants to deport him to his native Jordan where he is 
wanted on charges of terrorism.

Qatada
was held in a high security prison for eight years but was released to 
live in a £1,400-a-month property - paid for with state handouts - while
he fights his deportation on human rights grounds.

A Home Office spokesperson said last 
night: ‘The UK Border Agency arrested a 52-year-old man from north 
London for alleged breaches of his bail conditions imposed by the 
Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC).’

A spokesman said: ‘The searches were 
carried out under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and are in 
connection with ongoing inquiries by the Counter Terrorism Command.’

Qatada’s
arrest comes a few days before a Government appeal against the decision
to allow the radical preacher to stay in the UK.

The
25 bail conditions imposed on Qatada include a 22-hour home curfew and a
ban from attending a mosque or leaving a small area near his house.

He is not allowed a mobile phone, internet connection or more than one bank account and only vetted visitors can visit his home.

He
is also banned from publishing any statement, leading prayers other 
than for those in his own family and cannot arrange to meet people 
outside his home without Home Office permission.

The bail conditions state that if he meets an acquaintance by chance, he must make his excuses and leave.
