The New York Police Department is on the lookout for four to five daring vandals who scaled the Brooklyn Bridge Monday night and hoisted white flags above the New York City landmark.

Detectives still don't know who is responsible for the highly-organized caper that saw the American flags above the bridge taken down and replaced with Old Glory that had been bleached white.

The NYPD is treating the prank as a serious security breach and many New Yorkers are wondering how the culprits were able to slip past the police officers and surveillance cameras unnoticed at 3.30am.

Police believe that there were four or five thieves and that they worked in two teams - one for each bridge tower - to take down the flags.

A video from ABC News shows NYPD officers taking down the defaced banner after scaling the bridge about 11am on Tuesday.

Whitewash: This photo shows that the flags above the Brooklyn Bridge appear to have been bleached American Flags - the stars and stripes are faintly visible

No one knows why or how the flags were hoisted above the Brooklyn Bridge. Officials called it a major security breach

As the New York Post reports, however, this isn't the first time that the American flags have gone missing from the bridge - one of New York's most recognizable icons.

In 2012, thieves swiped the flags from both ends of the bridge, though the story never made it to the media, bridge painter Nick Krevatas told the Post.

The flags were replaced and the thieves have still never been caught. In 2004, during the Republican National Convention in New York, the flags were also stolen.

NYPD officials said that they believe the vandals may have been at the top of the bridge before. They tacked aluminum covers on the lights illuminating the flags, so that no one would notice the Stars and Stripes had been taken down until daybreak.

'For
 someone to go around it and go up to the tower and have right size 
cover to put over the light, there's some indication of pre-operational 
planning,' NYPD Deputy Commissioner John Miller said on Tuesday.

EarthCam
 video of the bridge shows that the first tower went dark about 3.35am. 
The second tower went dark seven minutes later, indicating the heist was
 at least a two-person job.

So far, the NYPD has no clue who is 
behind the flags or why they were hoisted above the bridge - though they
 don't believe it has any connection to terrorism or politics.

Police promptly raised American flags back to their rightful place above the bridge - replacing the Stars and Stripes that had been stolen

It's unclear how the vandals slipped past the police officers and security cameras guarding the bridge

'This
 may be somebody's art project, or it may be an attempt at a 
statement,' Miller said.

Several
 officers scaled the bridge and were seen lowering the flag on the 
Manhattan side around 11am Tuesday as traffic inched along the bridge.

The
 bridge is one of the most heavily secured landmarks in the city, 
constantly monitored by surveillance cameras. Police patrol cars are 
also stationed at both ends of the bridge.

Detectives
 are reviewing security footage in an attempt to determine who put up 
the white flags - and how they gained access to the span.

The support towers are 273-feet tall and it's unknown how the thieves managed to climb them without anyone noticing.

Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams blasted the vandals who took the American flags. 

'If flying a white flag atop the Brooklyn Bridge is someone’s idea of a joke, I’m not laughing,' he told the New York Post.

'The public safety of our city is of paramount importance, particularly our landmarks and bridges that are already known to be high-risk targets. We will not surrender our public safety to anyone, at any time.'

In April, New York artist Brendan Fagan - aka Justin Supine - scaled the Ed Koch-Queensboro Bridge and planted an art installation at the top. He was later arrested and charged with reckless endangerment and criminal trespass.
