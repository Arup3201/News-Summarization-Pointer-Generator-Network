A mother allegedly suffering from mental illness was found hanging in the basement of her home next to her nine-year-old daughter.

Ariana Rosa-Soares, 32, and her young daughter Marley were discovered underground in Brockton, Massachusetts on Friday morning.

Police would not comment on whether the deaths were a murder-suicide. A homicide was investigation opened by authorities, who added there is no danger to the public.

Hanged: Ariana Rosa-Soares, 32, (left) and her nine-year-old daughter Marley (right) were found hanged Friday morning in the basement of their home in Brockton, Massachusetts

Discovery: Police were called to the house around 9:45am after Rosa-Soares didn't pick up her daughter from a friend's house

Home: This is the house in the Massachusetts suburb where the two were found in the basement. Police say they found 'written material' there, but wouldn't say whether it was a suicide note

Outside the home today, Rosa-Soares's distraught father said he had been worried about her mental state and was concerned she was 'not a good mother'.

Jose Rosa told the Boston Globe he was convinced his daughter was mentally unwell, though he could not say whether she had ever been diagnosed.

He said: 'My daughter, she is not a good mother... I tried to get help ... to stop what happened now.'

Rosa said that the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families had been asked for help.

Rosa-Soares was divorced from Marley's father, and has another child, who is 11 and was staying with a friend at the time.

She moved to the United States from Cape Verde, an island off the west coast of Africa, around a decade ago. 

Concern: Rosa-Soares' father, Jose Rosa, above, said he feared something like this may happen, and suspected that his daughter had mental health problems

State police, as well as the local force in Brockton, 25 miles from Boston, are investigating. Autopsies are due in the next few days.

The Boston Globe reported that police found written material in the basement, but would not elaborate on the contents or say whether it was a suicide note.

Both mother and daughter were found by police around 9:45am after a friend who was worried about Rosa-Soares called police.

She had taken her 11-year-old to a friend's house to stay on Thursday night, who sounded the alarm after nobody came to collect her on Friday, despite Rosa-Soares's car being outside her house.

Friends told WCVB that Rosa-Soares had spoken about suicide some time ago - but had no immediate suspicions.
