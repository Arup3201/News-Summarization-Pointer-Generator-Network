A brewery has seen a spike in sales following a bizarre Twitter spat with teetotal politician George Galloway

A brewery has seen a spike in sales following a bizarre Twitter spat with teetotal politician George Galloway.

Matthew Halliday, the owner of the Bradford Brewing Company, said throngs of people have turned up at the brewery's Brewfactory bar in the wake of the online row.

The spat started after the Respect Party parliamentary candidate for Bradford West seemed to take offence after the brewing firm asked him if he was 'still a thing'.

Mr Galloway, who doesn't drink, responded to the beer makers, saying: 'What does that mean? And as a licensed premises in my constituency really be writing that?'

The brewer carefully reminded the politician that he was no longer the MP for the area after parliament was dissolved last Monday.

Galloway hit back, saying: 'Well then, I shall return to this matter after the election. You have been most unwise.'

Mr Halliday, 29, said: 'We have seen a bit boost in customers because of this. Almost everyone who came in yesterday did so because of Twitter.' 

'It was a cheeky tweet that I sent while I walked past his office early in the morning that just seemed to have escalated. We are now completely blocked and anyone connected to us has been blocked.

'I only asked him because he is the only candidate standing here that hasn't been into the pub to say hello.

'But after this argument I don't think we will be seeing Team Galloway in here anytime soon.'

Mr Halliday said that the spat has even sparked inspiration for a new brew that the firm plans to name after the fiery Scot.

He said: 'We are planning to bring out a Galloway soon. I don't want to say too much as it is top secret right now, but all I can say is it is weak, bitter and has a frothy head.'

The brewery also said that they would put forward a candidate at the next general election if Mr Galloway retains his seat on May 7.

A spokesman for Mr Galloway didn't wish to comment on the story and simply said: 'It certainly has put Bradford Brewery on the map.'
