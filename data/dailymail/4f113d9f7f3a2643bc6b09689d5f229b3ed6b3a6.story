A mini-black cab, a yellow submarine and a loaf of bread will be battling it out to win this year's Red Bull Soapbox Race - with marks awarded for sheer inventiveness, as well as speed of pedaling.

Following a nine-year absence, the race is back in London with entrants using sheer pedal-power to cross the finish line first in their homemade soapbox vehicles.

Out for a test drive around London this week, the contraptions will enter the race itself at Alexandra Palace in London on July 14.

Finishing first does not necessarily mean that a soapbox will win the competition, the impressive appearance of the boxes will count as well. 

Hotly tipped to win on the design front are Elvis' blue suede shoe, the Royal baby carriage, or a model of Alexandra Palace itself.

The replica Alexandra Palace will share the venue's most famous features - including the rose window, the BBC tower and Palm Court entrance.

Previous standout contestants have included a piano, a
rodeo clown, a massive corn on the cob, a jail cell and the Golden Gate
Bridge.

A vehicle like the patrol car pictured on Westminster Bridge takes around three weeks to build.

This particular model comes complete with flashing blue lights and changing number plates for pursuing criminals.

The soapboxes mainly take the form of a steel framework with bike wheels fixed onto an axle, so that the racer can steer and pedal.

As a global event, more than forty of the soapbox races have been held around the world since the 
first one in Brussels in 2000 – from Australia to South Africa,
Helsinki to St. Louis, Jamaica to Italy.

In the London race there will be around 70 imaginative designs battling it out on the day.
