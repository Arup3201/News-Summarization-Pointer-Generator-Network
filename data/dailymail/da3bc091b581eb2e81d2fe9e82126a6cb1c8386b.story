The skate-off in Sunday's Dancing On Ice semi-final was sensationally cancelled after medics ruled Gareth Thomas was too ill to perform.

The rugby player had ended up in the bottom two and had earlier only been able to perform one routine instead of two after struggling with severe motion sickness all week.

His illness meant Matt Lapinskas, Beth Tweddle and Luke Campbell all progressed straight to the 2013 final.

Struggle: Gareth Thomas was ruled out of the Dancing On Ice skate-off after struggling with severe motion sickness

Not well: Gareth and Robin only performed once on Sunday's show

In the videos of Gareth's rehearsals 
with partner Robin Johnstone, he was seen vomiting as he struggled with 
the flying harnesses.

Following his first performance to Coldplay's La Vida, Gareth looked visibly ill as he joined host Philip Schofield on stage.

He
was sweating and swaying and could barely speak as Philip asked him if 
he was OK, before prompting the athlete to leave the stage.

I can't do this:: Gareth looked really ill during a dress rehearsal to his flying routine earlier in the weekend

The DOI medics ruled he was too sick 
to take part in his flying routine, and during the results show, it was 
announced he had been ruled out of the skate-off.

Philip
told the audience: 'Gareth is in the skate-off, however due to the 
nature of his condition we have cancelled the skate-off.

'Viewers who voted tonight can apply for a refund. Gareth has withdrawn from the competition.'

Disappointed: Robin told Philip her partner was being looked after by medics after he was ruled out of the competition

Gareth ended up at the bottom of the 
leaderboard because he only had one routine contributing to his total 
score so it was no surprise to see him in the bottom two.

Each
celebrity and their partner had performed two routines each on Sunday -
one flying in a harness and the other remaining on the ice.

Speaking to Philip after the announcement Gareth had been deemed too ill to continue, his partner Robin said: 'Gareth's resting right now. He's a little disappointed. He was a little bit out of it actually.

Brave: Despite his illness, Gareth managed to perform with Robin to Coldplay earlier in the show

'He wanted me to pass on thank yous to everyone - cast, crew, Jayne and Chris.'

Christopher Dean added: 'He's a little upset. He's such a competitor. He's going to be really gutted.'

So to fill the time, all three finalists performed their 'save me' skate instead without the worry of the judges having to decide between them.

Filling the time: Beth and Dan performed their 'save me' skate

Although thrilled to be in the final, Beth, Matt and Luke were all sad at the way their friend Gareth had had to leave the competition.

Matt said: 'Gareth is a great guy and we're going to skate for him. I love ya mate.'

Boxer Luke added: 'We've been working hard and we're putting the time in. I'm gutted Gareth's gone out.'

The Dancing On Ice 2013 final is on ITV1 on Sunday 10th March at 7pm.
