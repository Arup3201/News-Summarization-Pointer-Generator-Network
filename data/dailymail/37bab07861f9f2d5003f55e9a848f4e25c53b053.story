The heroic mother who threw herself on her children to save them from a deadly tornado that ravaged their Indiana home has spoken out about the terrifying ordeal from her hospital bed.

Stephanie Decker, 37, lost one leg above the knee and the other foot protecting her eight-year-old son and five-year-old daughter as the storm flattened their 'dream home' in Henryville, Indiana.

Speaking out for the first time since her courageous show of love, Mrs Decker recounted the comforting words she said to her children as they screamed that they did not want to live without her.

Heroine: Stephanie Decker threw herself on her two young children to save them from the tornado that flattened their home. She has recounted the fearful moments from her hospital bed

She also remembered how she was so uncertain that she was going to survive that she filmed a message on her mobile phone to her husband, telling him she loved him.

'I assumed I was safe and I heard the 
roar like a train, and I heard it behind me, and I knew it was coming,' 
she told ABC News from her hospital bed in Louisville, Kentucky.

'And it was so loud that I knew that I needed to do 
something different. I knew staying put wasn't going to work.'

With the house disintegrating, she grabbed her son Dominic, eight, and daughter Reese, five, and ran to the basement, where she wrapped them in a blanket and climbed on top of them.

'I remember the whole thing,' she said. 'I stayed conscious the whole time. I couldn't afford [to pass out]. 
They needed me. They had to have me, so I had to figure out what to do.'

She held on tightly to the children as the house fell down around her.

'Everything started hitting my back, beams, pillars, furniture - everything was slamming into my back,' she told The Today Show. 'But I had my children in the blanket and I was on top of them and I was reaching around holding them.

'They were screaming, "Mommy, I can’t live without you! I don’t wanna die, please don’t let me die!" and I said, "you’re not going to die, we’re going to make it".'

Then she realised she had been badly hurt, with her leg appearing as if it had been severed. She also suffered seven broken ribs and a punctured lung.

Fighting back the tears, she said: 'It was cut off or it was barely attached. I took my phone and I made a video to my husband to tell him I love him.'

'Dream home': The Deckers had spent nine months building their home in Henryville, Louisiana

Ruins: The home was reduced to a pile of rubble by the 175 mph storm that flattened much of the town

'I knew it was bad. If I didn't get help soon, I was going to bleed out,' she added to ABC News.

Knowing his mother was hurt, it was Dominic's turn for bravery. He crawled out from under his mother and ran to a neighbor's house.

'After Dominic left, I realised I couldn't get out because I actually used the comforter I tied with them as a tourniquet. I knew I was cut,' she said.

One neighbour, Brian Lovins, a Clark 
County Sheriff’s officer, used his belt to create a tighter tourniquet and 
drove her until he could flag down an ambulance, which took her to 
hospital.

Mrs Decker added, tearfully: 'I want these kids to have a mum and I did not want them to grow up without me.'

Her husband, Joe Decker, tearfully said that the flattened house had been their dream home.

His
wife had said she always wanted to have the children's handprints 
imprinted in the foundation's cement, because 'we were never gonna leave
here'.

Fears: Mrs Decker was so worried she was going to die as a result of her injuries that she filmed a video on her mobile phone for her husband Joe, pictured, to tell him she loved him

Saved: Mrs Decker protected her two children, eight-year-old Dominic (L) and five-year-old Reese (R)

Motherly: Mrs Decker, pictured with Dominic and her nephew, was saved when her son ran for help

The small prints, with the 'Reese' and 'D' for Dominic, remain scrawled in the concrete.

Mr Decker said: 'What I told her was: "You’re alive and 
you get to see your kids grow up".'

The home, which was partly built by Mr 
Decker and his wife's father, is now completely destroyed, with a 
bathtub 200 feet away in a nearby field, the Courier Journal reported.

The house 'took about nine months to build and about four seconds' to fall, Mr Decker added.

Henryville
was nearly entirely flattened by a series of tornadoes that ravaged the
South and Midwest on Friday March 3, killing 39 and leaving thousands homeless.

Scared: As the house fell around them, Reese (R) screamed that she could not live without her mother

Remaining strong: The children's hand prints can still be seen in the home's foundations

Physicians Ancillary Services, where Stephanie has worked for three years, released a statement, the Frankfort Journal reported.

CEO Carl J. Tyler praised the Deckers 
who 'lost everything' and said that the company has set up a trust fund,
The Stephanie Decker Recovery Fund, to help pay their medical bills and
the losses they suffered.

He added: 'I can tell you they are 
some of the hardest working, giving people you could ever want to meet. 
They would never ask for help, but would be there to give it to others 
in a second.'

Snow fell across parts of Indiana on Sunday night, adding insult to injury and stunting rescue efforts.

Destruction: The Decker family home was just one of the hundreds 
destroyed by tornadoes in Indiana. Damage can be seen in nearby Marysville which was 
entirely wiped off the map by the severe weather

Hundreds of homes, businesses, schools and vehicles across the country have been destroyed by the spate of tornadoes last week.

The storms on Friday claimed lives in
Alabama, Georgia. Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio, with Indiana and Kentucky
particularly hit, with 13 and 21 lives lost respectively.

Additional fatalities may result as cleanup crews clear rubble from more than 85 twisters across 10 states.

Hundreds of others were injured in the biggest one-day burst of 
tornadoes in March in U.S. Weather Service history.
