Proud daughter Jen Fitzpatrick wants to follow in the footsteps of her glamorous mum and become a top beauty queen.

The 23-year-old, from Torfaen, South Wales, was inspired to hit the catwalk by her elegant mother, Merle, who won a string of pageants before her tragic death when Jen was just 11.

Merle wowed the crowds at beauty competitions even winning the title of Miss Cardiff  before falling pregnant - she then traded in her sashes and trophies to spend more time with her family.

However she passed away after a battle with breast cancer in 2003. Now Jen is following in her mum's footsteps and wants to honour her memory by becoming the new Miss Wales.

Jen, a qualified nurse, said: 'I thought taking part could be my way of keeping mum's memory alive.

'My beautiful mum might not be here to cheer me on but I know that if that beauty queen crown is placed on my head her smile will be beaming down on me.

'I loved the idea of following in my mum's footsteps. I hope she would be proud.'

When Jen turned 16 she started to notice the likeness she shared with her mum when she looked in the mirror.

She really treasured their similarities and vowed to make her mum proud by working hard and qualifying as a nurse.

Then in early 2014 she saw Miss Wales were welcoming applicants for the next year and she decided to apply.

Jen said: 'Mum was always so modest about her many successes as a beauty queen but I was fascinated and used to ask to see her old photos often.

'Her smile would just shine out of the pictures and she always looked so glamorous. She kept her trophies in the attic but I liked digging them out to play with.

'I was utterly heartbroken when mum died. It was hard for a very long time to keep it together day to day.

'I was even envious of friends when they moaned about their mums. I'd have given anything for a teenage row with mine.'

Jen hopes to keep her mum's memory alive by winning the Miss Wales final in Swansea, South Wales, next month.

Merle took part in many competitions when she was younger something which Jennifer now wishes to do

Jennifer was close to her mother who sadly died in 2003 from breast cancer
