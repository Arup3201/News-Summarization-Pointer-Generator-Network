A man who helped rescue  surfer Sean Pollard after a shark tore off his hand and part of his other arm says the bravest thing he has ever seen is the injured 23-year-old swimming to safety.

Mr Pollard is in a critical condition in a Perth hospital after having one arm severed below the elbow and the other hand torn off, as well as suffering leg injuries.

A couple of witnesses came forward on Friday and recalled how they saw the Bunbury local stumble through the shallows towards his horrified girlfriend before collapsing on the beach.

His girlfriend Claire Oakford has also described the terrifying moment her partner came out of the surf as she lay on the sand at Kelpids Beach, an isolated area at Wylie Bay near the West Australian town of Esperance, about 11am Thursday.

Witness Ross Tamlin was surfing about 400m away from Mr Pollard and said they were the only ones that far out. 

'I just heard this almighty scream and I just felt very uneasy by it, and knowing of the shark sightings of recent times out there, I quickly got out of the water,' he told reporters in Esperance on Friday.

Mr Tamlin said he and another man drove to the spot and saw Mr Pollard lying on his back in the water.

Dean Gaebler, who helped rescue Mr Pollard, described the moment he saw the injured surfer.

'He (Mr Pollard) stood up and fell back on his back. When I got out to him he was just lying on his back, eyes shut,' Mr Gaebler told Perth Now.  

Two men dragged Mr Pollard ashore and Mr Tamlin made the emergency phone call.

A man known as Robbie said he had been planning to give his nephew a surfing lesson when Mr Pollard collapsed about 20 metres out and saw him being dragged ashore.

'He's obviously swum about 100 metres with those injuries ... it was probably the bravest thing I've ever seen,' he told Fairfax radio.

Robbie said an off-duty paramedic at the beach saved Mr Pollard's life.

The paramedic, Kylie Rothnie, attached a tourniquet to his limbs and wrapped them in towels, stemming the flow of blood until an ambulance arrived.

'Two guys raced out and grabbed him,' Robbie said.

'There was a paramedic by them. I think her husband was there surfing. She probably saved his life.

'You couldn't give her enough props.'

Ms Rothnie told Perth Now that Mr Pollard was a brave man.

'He was conscious the whole time,' she said.

'He was so brave through the whole thing.'

Mr Tamlin, who often visits the beach, said it was a 'remarkable effort' for Mr Pollard to swim that far to safety by himself.

'It was the most horrific thing you have ever seen in your life,' he told Perth Now.

'For that (attack) to happen at our local break's pretty upsetting and pretty daunting.'

Robbie drove Mr Pollard to meet the ambulance and said the injured man remained conscious while his partner talked to him, despite losing a lot of blood.

Ms Oakford  told a friend - Kurd Cadman - before flying out to Perth on Thursday about the terrifying ordeal she witnessed.

Mr Cadman  said she had been lying on the beach enjoying the couple's Esperance holiday when she quickly realised something was horribly wrong as he emerged from the surf.

She rushed to his side while several others, including an off-duty paramedic, attended to his wounds.   

An Esperance police officer spoke to Ms Oakford from her partner's hospital bed on Friday morning, where he said the pair  were grateful to everyone who helped.

Senior Sergeant Richard Moore said the couple have a positive outlook on the future.

He added that Mr Pollard was awake and his partner's family was flying to WA from Tasmania.

'He is in a stable condition in the trauma ward at Royal Perth Hospital,' Senior Sergeant Richard Moore told The West Australian.

'He has a very positive attitude and he and his partner Claire have thanked the community and the emergency services for their assistance yesterday.'

The Esperance community has also started fundraising to help with Mr Pollard's recovery with collection tins at the Shire's administration and leisure centres.

The Lions Club will arrange for the money to be given to Mr Pollard after October 17.

Officials caught two great white sharks in the hours after the attack and were preparing to cut them open to try to determine if one - or both - of them was responsible for the attack. 

Mr Pollard was flown to Perth by the Royal Flying Doctor Service within hours of the attack on Thursday

Mr Pollard's football club, the South Bunbury Football Club, paid tribute to him in a Facebook post and pledged their support for his family.

The club wrote on its Facebook on Thursday afternoon: 'Today a young man was attacked by a shark in Esperance. Unfortunately the young man is one of our own in Sean Pollard.'

'Our thoughts are with Polly and his family from everyone at South Bunbury Football Club. We are with you all the way mate,' the post continued.

The club is playing in its grand final this weekend and Mr Kelly said there was 'no doubt' the club would rally around Mr Pollard.

Bunbury deputy mayor Brendan Kelly - himself a surfer - said '99.9 per cent' of patrolled or popular beaches along the south east coastline were safe, however isolated surf spots are a haven for sharks.

'There's a term over here called "sharky",' he said.

'If the water looks dark, the sky is grey and overcast, and there is generally good surf, then that's when there is going to be sharks about.'

He said surfers know the risks and people should take the same precautions in WA surf as people visiting 'billabongs in Northern Territory would with crocodiles'. 

'Most of the surfers I know acknowledge that.'

WA Premier Colin Barnett said it was necessary to kill the two white pointers because they posed an imminent threat to public safety.

'The threat is there and sadly (Thursday) just demonstrated how likely a shark attack can happen,' Mr Barnett said.  

'Perth beaches are probably as safe as we can reasonably make them (but) the south west and the southern coastline is a different matter.' 

The state's Fisheries Department responded to the attack by catching and killing two white pointers on drumlines - one measuring up to 4.5 metres and the other three metres.

It was the first time white pointers - a protected species - had been killed by WA officials.

Fisheries shark response unit manager Lisa Clack defended the move amid reports Mr Pollard might have been mauled by two bronze whalers, saying it was 'more likely' a white pointer was responsible.

'Advice from our shark scientists indicated that basically given the nature of the injuries and the location it occurred, it's not likely that the species was a bronze whaler,' she told Fairfax radio.

Ms Clack said the two captured sharks would be transported to Perth and dissected and examined, although sharks often disgorge stomach contents so their role might never be confirmed.

Drumlines have not been redeployed but beaches from Wylie Bay to Cape Le Grand remain closed. 

It is believed the girlfriend of Sean Pollard is by his side at hospital 

A spokeswoman for the WA Department of Fisheries said a white shark has been caught near Wylie Bay, at Kelpids Beach, about six kilometres from Esperance 

 

Shark cull: This tiger shark was caught in the Margaret River region, WA, as part of the state government's controversial 'catch and kill' program in February.
