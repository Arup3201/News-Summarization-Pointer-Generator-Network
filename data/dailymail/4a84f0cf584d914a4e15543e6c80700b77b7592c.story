Pilots flying in to Beijing from China's 10 busiest airports will be required to know how to land 'blind' because the smog there has got so bad.

From the New Year, the country's civil aviation authority will require the pilots of even small commercial airlines to be able to land using just their instruments on hazy days.

The move is aimed at easing delays at Beijing Capital International Airport, which has had the worst flight delays out of 35 international airports.

China's Civil Aviation Administration of China announced the change which will require pilots to have a 'blind landing category 2' certification allowing them to land in poor visibility, CNN reported.

A CAAC source told the China Daily: 'It is part of a series of measures the administration took recently to raise flights' on-time performance.'

China's toxic smog problem has become international news in the last week as thick smog blanketed cities and forced schools to close.

The latest bout of smog in Beijing and Shanghai led to the cancellation or delay of hundreds of flights, stranding passengers and creating chaos at airports.

Last week, in a bungled attempt to play down the problem, state media tried to make a joke of it.

Two of China's most influential news outlets suggested that the dense smog, which is so thick it has reduced visibility to just a few feet in places, can teach people about meteorology and help them learn new jokes to cope in the crisis.

Chinese state controlled broadcaster CCTV and the widely read tabloid the Global Times, published by the Communist Party's official People's Daily, both tried to put a positive spin on the problem.

The Global Times said smog could be useful in military situations, as it could hinder the use of guided missiles, while CCTV listed five 'unforeseen rewards' for smog, including helping Chinese people's sense of humour.

Both pieces have since been deleted from their websites, but not before bloggers posted copies of the controversial articles online.
