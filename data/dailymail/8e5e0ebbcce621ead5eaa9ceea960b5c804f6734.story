Magistrates were left stunned when a cannabis user said he was 'too busy' to come into court for sentencing and shouted through the door: 'I'll be two minutes.'

Steven Holford said 'sorry guys', when he eventually entered the courtroom at Telford Magistrates', but a legal adviser said his arrogance was 'utterly disrespectful'.

The relaxed 27-year old, dressed in a hoodie and jeans, was due to be sentenced for possession of high-grade cannabis when he made the rude remarks

Rude: The legal adviser at Telford Magistrates' Court told drug user Stephen Holford, 27, he was 'utterly disrespectful' after claiming he was too busy to enter the courtroom

Legal advisor Kerry Nickless told him: 'When you are called into court you do not open the door and say two minutes, you come straight into court. It is extremely disrespectful.'

The court heard police found 1.94 grams of high-grade cannabis at Holford's home in Madeley, Telford, Shropshire, in January this year.

Prosecutor Miss Sara Beddow said officers also found a set of weighing scales after searching the house.

She said: 'He told police he purchased a quarter of the cannabis each week for £50 and used the scales to divide it equally into a gram a day.'

Holford represented himself in court and pleaded guilty to possession of a class B drug.

When asked if he had anything to say in his defence he replied: 'I just had it there to smoke, like.'

He was fined £175 and ordered to pay costs of £85 and a victim surcharge of £25.

Holford added: 'I'm not going to be able to pay it now, I get paid fortnightly.

'What about the other stuff that got taken off me? They took £200 off me. I could've paid today if they gave it me back.'

Holford was advised to take the matter up with West Mercia Police before being told he was free to leave court.

He turned to the bench and said 'thank you guys' before leaving the courtroom.
