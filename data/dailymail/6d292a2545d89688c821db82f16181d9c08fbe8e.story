Annie Lennox does not seem to be a big fan of today's young pop stars.

The legendary Scottish singer, who found fame as one half of the internationally acclaimed group the Eurythmics alongside Dave Stewart, was asked in a recent interview to further explain comments she made earlier this year that Beyonce was not a 'feminist,' but rather a 'feminist lite.'

And Lennox did not hold back.

Round two: Annie Lennox (performing above with Dave Stewart as the Eurythmics) has again spoken about her belief that Beyonce is not really a feminist in a recent interview

Putting it bluntly: Lennox (seen at the Grammys in 1995 on left and the 2004 Oscars on right) told NPR that 'twerking is not feminism'

'Listen, twerking is not feminism,' said the 59-year-old artist. 

'It's not - it's not liberating, it's not empowering. It's a sexual thing that you're doing on a stage; it doesn't empower you. That's my feeling about it.'

In addition to Beyonce, twerking has been a big part of musical artists like Rihanna and Miley Cyrus' recent stage and music video performances. 

In the interview, with NPR's Steve Inskeep, the singer also broke down just what her problem is with pop music these days.

'The reason why I've commented is because I think that this overt sexuality thrust -- literally -- at particular audiences, when very often performers have a very, very young audience, like 7 years older, I find it disturbing and I think its exploitative. It's troubling. I'm coming from a perspective of a woman that's had children,' she explained.

Queen: Of course, the biggest twerker of all is Miley Cyrus (seen above performing with Robin Thicke at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards)

This whole debate began when Lennox was asked what she thought about the 33-year-old labeling herself a feminist while on stage at the MTV Video Music Awards back in August. 

'I just love her performances - but I'd like to sit down [with her]. I think I'd like to sit down with quite a few artists and talk to them. I'd like to listen to them; I'd like to hear what they truly think,' Lennox said at the time to Pride Source. 

Lennox also seems to be well aware of how polarizing her opinion on the subject is, telling Inskeep at the end of their interview, 'Maybe this is a good thing because it creates debate.'

The singer was on the program to promote her new album, Nostalgia.
