A woman has filed a law suit against five people she claims secretly filmed her having a sexual encounter with a Buddhist monk at the temple they both attend before leaking it to the community.

Maya Men claims community member violated her right to privacy when they allegedly spread the tape of her and the Venerable Nhem Kimteng - even uploading it to YouTube briefly.

It is unclear when the video was recorded at Trairatanaram Temple in North Chelmsford, Massachusetts, but Men said she had not given permission for it to be filmed or distributed.

Members of the close-knit Cambodian community in Lowell have said they are disgusted by the video's 
contents as Buddhist monks are supposed to be celibate.

The lawsuit, filed in Middlesex Superior Court, states the defendants' actions intentionally inflicted emotional distress on Men, the Lowell Sun reported.

She feels she 'has been held up to her relevant community as an individual who should be shunned and scorned, called a thief, and referred to by a plethora of pejorative terms', the suit states.

The lawsuit seeks damages and seizure of all copies of the recording.

The suit names Cheng Leang, a monk and a member of the board of the Community of Khmer Buddhist Monks - on which Kimteng and Men both sat until he was dismissed after the tape surfaced.

Sam Meas, a CKBM executive committee
member who was dismissed last year after asking for an audit of the 
project's finances, is also named.

'Illegal': Men claimed that she did not give permission to be filmed or for the tape to be shared

It also names other community members Sovann Khon, Lee Veng Chou and Denys Meung.

In the suit, Men argues that she never gave consent for her private sexual acts to be disclosed, and 
says both the video and a recent email about her are evidence of illegal
action.

The email said that the sex video was
secretly recorded by the Venerable Leang and accuses Men of 'using
her sex life to take control of all top-level monks', the Lowell Sun reported.

The accusations have roiled the region's Cambodian community, with many now skeptical of the internal workings of the temple, as Men was helping lead an effort to raise money for a new building.

Until he was removed, Kimteng was also a member of the executive committee for the $10 million Lowell temple project.

The community has held meetings and rallies to speak out about the relationship, and have called for Men to be dismissed from her role in the fundraising project.

They have expressed their surprise that the head monk of the CKBM, Venerable Sao Khon, has dismissed Kimteng but not Men.

Lowell City Councilor Vesna Nuon, who has urged Khon to dismiss Men, attended the rally.

'The community is being destroyed by the two individuals in the tape,' he said. 'The fact that the lady is still there is angering the community and there is agreement on what the head monk should do.

'It outraged all of us and hurt all of us. It is also embarrassing for all of us and cannot be tolerated.'

Backlash: The community is calling for Men to be dismissed from the committee where she oversees a $10 million project for a new Buddhist temple. Kimteng has already been dismissed

Rithy Uong, a former Lowell city councilor, added: 'It is one of the worst things a Buddhist can do. We cannot believe it happened. It discredits the entire Cambodian and Buddhist community.'

In the statement released to the Lowell Sun, the CKBM says it has begun an internal investigation into the allegations of sexual misconduct.

While Kimteng and Men both deny being in the tape, The Sun reported that it received a DVD of the video and independently confirmed it did feature the pair.
