Starting piano lessons before the age of seven may turbo-charge the brain.

A study found that learning to play a musical instrument seems to strengthen the brain – with the biggest benefits found in those who began lessons while still very young.

The researchers said: ‘Early musical training does more good for kids than just making it easier for them to enjoy music.

‘It changes their brain and these brain changes could lead to cognitive advances as well.’ 

The Chinese researchers studied the brains of 48 men and women aged between 19 and 21.

All had done at least a year of music practice, with some starting as young as three.

Parts of the brain key to language, planning and time management appeared to be stronger in those who started younger.

Plus regions involved in hearing sound and in self-awareness were bigger.

The finding held true even when the number of years spent practising was taken into account, the Society for Neuroscience’s annual conference heard.

The researchers, from Beijing Normal University, said that some of the brain regions impacted by music develop rapidly early in life.

Research released last week revealed that music lessons aren’t wasted, with adults who hadn’t played an instrument since childhood benefiting from practice put in decades earlier.

The US study showed that the more years that adults had spent practising an musical instrument in their youth, the faster the cells in their brains responded to sound.

Faster processing of sound should help keep hearing sharp into old age by making it easier to make out a conversation over background noise, or to hear clearly while talking on the phone.

All instruments, from the piano to accordion helped equally.

Other studies have shown that learning a musical instrument can boost IQ, make it easier to pick up new languages and interpret the emotions of others.

But while music lessons in general seem to be beneficial, it is thought that those who enjoy learning an instrument reap the biggest benefits.
