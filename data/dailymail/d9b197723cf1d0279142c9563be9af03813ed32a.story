Petra Stunt, 25 (pictured with husband James), bought Sloane House for £70million in February 2012 and asked friend Paul Fleury to take charge of the renovations

The daughter of Formula 1 billionaire Bernie Ecclestone is suing a trusted friend who was in charge of restoring her £100million Chelsea mansion, saying he siphoned £1.6million into his private bank accounts.

Petra Stunt, 25, bought one of London’s most magnificent townhouses, Sloane House, for £70million in February 2012 and appointed Paul Fleury, 45, to oversee lavish renovations.

The socialite had a budget of £25million to transform the historic building in West London, including a new wing, featuring a pool, gymnasium and underground car park.

But last year the family discovered that Fleury – a friend who had worked for them for the past seven years and was paid £7,000 a month to manage the renovation work – was allegedly forging invoices from companies that did not exist and paying them into bank accounts controlled by him.

In the writ served by Princess Diana’s former lawyers, Mishcon de Reya, it is alleged Fleury is a ‘sophisticated fraudster’ who sent Petra the invoices via a company she owns called Sloane House Ltd.

It was a clearly a step too far for the flamboyant Petra who, alongside sister Tamara, 29, is often portrayed as spending ‘Daddy’s billions’ with barely a thought for the bottom line.

When Petra married art collector James Stunt, her mother Slavica justified the £12million cost of the three-day nuptials as ‘worth every penny’.

When she bought Sloane House, formerly owned by Tory peer Lord Bamford, friends quipped ‘it will give Petra something to do’.

Petra alleges that family friend Fleury billed her with fake invoices worth £1.6million and siphoned off the money into accounts controlled by him

Fleury says his payments had been verbally agreed with Petra and that they were ‘commissions’ – a claim denied by the Ecclestones.

Fleury helped to renovate and restore eight family properties, he said, including one in Switzerland. He told The Mail on Sunday that he had considered himself a ‘family friend’ and had attended Petra’s wedding.

He added: ‘It’s a complicated story. I am surprised the Ecclestone family want this coming to court.’

A spokesman for Petra said: ‘As this is before the courts at present, we cannot comment.’
