Within the next 30 years, the global population is set to increase by almost 3 billion up to 10 billion, and this rise is set to put a heavy burden on the healthcare industry.

Futurologist Peter Cochrane has predicted how he believes the world will cope with this extra demand, and which technologies are set to revolutionise medical treatment over the next 25 years. 

His forecasts include lighting that helps people recover from illness, virtual surgeries and wearables that detect cancer molecules.

Futurologist Peter Cochrane has predicted how he believes the world will cope with an ageing and increasing population over the next 25 years, and which technologies are set to revolutionise medical treatment

The claims were made in Mr Cochrane’s Future Technologies of Health and Care, Wellbeing and Transformation report, commissioned by Philips Innovation.

It also addressed how traditional job roles will evolve.

Peter Cochrane believes that technology is easing people away from ‘mass medicine and treatment’ into a more focused world of personalised medicine targeted at the individual, whether that be at home or in public hospitals.

Sensors will soon be able to relief pain, as well as detect cancer and other chemical inbalances in the body. 

Material, food, water and energy waste will be reduced thanks to the so-called Clouds of Things, where everything is tracked, has sensors, and can communicate with each other. 

And within 25 years, Mr Cochrane said jobs such as bankers, receptionists, call centre and warehouse operatives, will become redundant, with occupations such as 'cyborg engineers' and 'crime predictors' becoming common.

‘[Population figures] sound bleak, but the reality is that technology has satisfied all our desires and needs and we’ve never been in a better position than we are today,’ said Mr Cochrane.

‘I’ve looked at how human needs will impact on innovation, both now and in the future.’

Mr Cochrane explained that all the complex technology of medical care is currently concentrated in hospitals, but it is gradually heading to the doctor’s office.

This will then head to bathroom cabinets, and in the future, people are increasingly going to be looking after their own health, using apps or virtual surgeries.

The NetDoctors website, for example, already offers virtual appointments with doctors, so patients can discuss conditions or problems, ask queries about an odd-looking rash or seek advice when they can’t get an appointment with their GP.

Dr Sirfraz Hussain, a GP at the Moss Side Family Practice in Manchester, similarly uses Skype to consult with his patients and said they have ‘revolutionised’ his practice by cutting waiting times.

According to the report, these advancements prove that technology is moving away from mass medical treatment into a more ‘focused, personalised approach targeted at the individual.’

‘Whether at home, or in public hospitals many of the big expensive machines and laboratory facilities associated with hospitals are being miniaturised, simplified and migrated to the doctors’ surgery and in turn will soon be seen in our bathroom cabinets,’ continued the report.

It also explained that a new range of sensors could one day promise everything from non-invasive scanning, to pheromone analysis capable of detecting the early onset of some cancers and other diseases.

These in theory could be placed inside wearable devices such as a wristband. 

There are already a number of skin cancer apps available, too, that claim to be able to analyse and assess moles based on size and shape, including Doctor Mole and DermoScreen.

Elsewhere, Philips has been working with devices including Pulse Relief - a gadget that tracks an individual’s pain, and monitors how it affects their life.

The Future Technologies of Health and Care, Wellbeing and Transformation report, by futurologist Peter Cochrane looks at how medical trends will revolutionise healthcare by 2040, His predictions include the rise of blue LEDs, virtual surgeries and appointments (pictured), and sensors that detect cancer molecules

While blue LED light technology, which recently won the Nobel Prize in Physics, is used in products such as Blue Touch, a wearable blue LED light pain patch.

Philips BlueTouch uses blue LED lights to stimulate the body’s natural production of nitric oxide.

Mr Cochrane also believes that in the near future, we will be able to 3D print replacement body parts

This boosts circulation and increases the spread of oxygen and nutrients through the body to treat mild to moderate pains.

The report went on to say that our homes and hospitals will look different in the future meaning our environments will help with recovery, in addition to medical technologies.

Lighting and sound, for example, is being experimented with to see how changes in hues, or noise, can help a patient heal or recover quicker. 

And these rooms can ‘adapt’ to respond to any changes.

Another such innovation in offices, hotels and public buildings is carpets that provide information and directions through the combination of LED lighting and light-transmissive materials.

Lighting is also being used to boost food production. 

For example, an indoor farm in Japan uses 17,500 LED lights spread over 18 cultivation racks, and these lights are used to mimic day and night.

By monitoring the photosynthesis process carefully, the system grows lettuce two-and-a-half times faster than an outdoor farm.

It also cuts waste product by 40 per cent and productivity per square foot is up 100-fold.  

Purple lighting is used to mimic night, 
for example, while the white lights are adjusted slowly throughout the 
day to mimic a sun moving through the sky.  

And home lighting, including examples such as Philips Hue and LiFx, can now alert users if there is someone at the door, flash when a favourite team scores a goal, or change colour when a text message is received.

Philips, for example, has been working with devices including Blue Touch (pictured). It uses blue LED lights, which recently won the Nobel Prize in Physics, to detect and relieve back pain. It uses the lights to stimulate the body’s natural production of nitric oxide to boost circulation and the spread of oxygen around the body

Technology, and in particular smart lighting, is similarly being used to tackle food shortages and waste. For example, an indoor farm in Japan uses 17,500 LED lights (pictured) to mimic day and night. By monitoring photosynthesis process carefully, the system grows lettuce two-and-a-half times faster than an outdoor farm

They can also be remotely controlled to protect houses when homeowners are on holiday, for example.

Finally, the report looked at how jobs will change and evolve thanks to advances in technology.

In the next 25 years, jobs such as bankers, receptionists, call centre and warehouse operatives, stock traders, train drivers, pilots and even journalists are expected to change, said Mr Cochrane, as innovations develop to respond to human needs.

And home lighting, including examples such as Philips Hue (pictured left) and LiFx (pictured right), can now alert users if there is someone at the door, flash when a favourite team scores a goal, or change colour when a text message is received to make our lives easier

Finally, the report looked at how jobs will change and evolve thanks to advances in technology. In the next 25 years, Mr Cochrane believes new jobs will be created, such as ‘cyborg engineers’, ‘crime predictors’ - similar to those seen in film Minority Report (Tom Cruise pictured) - and ‘information caretakers’

Mr Cochrane believes this will result in the creation of as yet unheard of jobs such as ‘cyborg engineers’, ‘crime predictors’ – similar to those seen in film Minority Report - and ‘information caretakers.’

Twitter and Facebook is often praised for increasing awareness, and boosting so-called 'citizen journalism', but Mr Cochrane said that this also increases the spread of misinformation.

He predicts that this will additionally lead to the rise of 'truth engines', that act like search engines but only show verified information. 

‘When confronted by any new technology we should ask one vital question - what benefit will it bring to my life? And the answer should guide our decision to embrace or avoid,’ concluded Mr Cochrane.
