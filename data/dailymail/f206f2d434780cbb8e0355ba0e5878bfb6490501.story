A Catholic priest who announced his resignation last week after confessing he made a woman pregnant has now become the father of a baby boy.

Father Daniel McFalls’ son was born on Saturday and given the name, Gabriel.

‘He’s a beautiful kid,’ said the 58-year-old McFalls after the birth.

McFalls - known as Dean - from St. Mary's Catholic Church in Stockton, California, voluntarily quit his post on Tuesday after admitting he had got a woman pregnant.

New father: Catholic priest, Dean McFalls is now the father of a baby boy, Gabriel, who was born on Saturday

Quit: McFalls voluntarily stepped down from his post on Tuesday after admitting he had got a woman pregnant

In a letter sent to the church and read to his congregation, McFalls said: 'A child will soon be born, and I am the baby’s father. I know this comes as a shock to you and, to many, a disappointment.

'I assume full responsibility for my actions and will do all that I can so that my child receives the care and love that he deserves.

McFalls' was given an indefinite leave of absence by Bishop Stephen E. Blaire, head of the Diocese of Stockton, and will now have to decide if he wants to remain a priest.

The identity of the mother has not yet been released, nor whether he intends to marry her.

At the time of McFalls’ controversial confession, one of members of his congregations said they were glad he was gone, calling him ‘flirty’.

'Flirty': Some of the parishioners said he was flirty, while others said he was just plain friendly

Diana Garcia, who has attended the church for 15 years, said he has pursued other woman, including her daughters.

'He’s just lustful. He didn’t say he was in love or [will] marry the girl, no.

'It’s not about being a sinner, it’s about playing with God, he made a vow, this is a priest we’re talking about.'

However, some long-time parishioners said his friendly disposition may be perceived by some as flirtatious.

‘He’s a very friendly man and everyone thinks that he’s their best friend. So, you can misconstrue that,’ Cathleen Cavanaugh told Fox 40. ‘He spreads himself to everybody. He loves the poor, the young, the sick.’ 

'Loves everyone': Cathleen Cavanaugh, a long-time parishioner said McFalls would spread his love to everyone

McFalls said the accusations by some of the members were unfounded.

‘I was pretty hurt … My reputation was really damaged,’ he said.

‘I went out of my way to make a public confession and acknowledge my error and take responsibility.’

He spoke about one woman who asked him to do an exorcism.

‘When I said I wasn’t free to exorcise her at that time she said that she was going to take it farther …because she was possessed, and  I want to pray for her. I’ve known her for years.’

'Pretty hurt': McFalls said his reputation was damaged after his confession and said he was hurt by some of the accusations from members of the parish

'Wonderful': Terri Lomeli, another parishioner, said the priest was always there to help the people in his congregation

Another long-time parishioner, Terri Lomeli, said the accusations were not ‘accurate in any way’.

‘I’ve known him for quite some time, and I have never felt that that would be accurate in any way. He’s been nothing but wonderful,’ she said.

‘I’ve had a rough couple of years, and he has been over to my home many times just with a call to say prayers with my family and children at all different times of the day,’ said Lomeli.
