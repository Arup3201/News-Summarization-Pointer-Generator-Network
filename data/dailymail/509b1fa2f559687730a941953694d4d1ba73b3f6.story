Frank Lampard's new team played its first ever match against St Mirren with their big-name signing 45 miles away in Stoke.

The Chelsea legend was supposed to join New York City last month ahead of their inaugural MLS season.

But while City's US franchise made their debut in a friendly with the Buddies at the parent club's Football Academy, Lampard was relaxing an hour away down the M6 in a hotel as Manuel Pellegrini's men look to get their season back on track at the Britannia Stadium.

City have faced the music for keeping Lampard for the rest of the season as they look to retain their Premier League title but officials put a brave face on his absence from last night's inaugural gig for the American offshoot.

They were keen to point out that Lampard has been to a number of training sessions as his new pals made the most of City's £200m facilities and added that he had even enjoyed a couple of getting-to-know-you beers.

One man who did make his debut on a chilly night in Manchester was former Spain striker David Villa.

The twinkle-toed 33-year-old has graced some of the world's biggest stages but this was a low key introduction in front of around 2,000 supporters on the site of an old dyeworks who, given City's difficulties in front of goal, may have wished he was plying his trade across the road.

There was an air of inevitability that Villa would break the deadlock and he got his chance on 27 minutes when two Buddies defenders made a hash of clearing a cross from the left.

Villa, with the freedom of Manchester, span on the ball before clinically side footing past Marian Kello.

New York celebrated their first ever victory, even with a missing Frank Lampard, with a good performance

The ex-Barcelona and Valencia man has Champions League, European Championship and World Cup winners medals in his collection and he will now go down in history as the man who scored the New York City FC's first ever goal thanks to a gift from the Scots.

But Villa was given a reminder that the Saints were not here just to make friends moments later when he nutmegged battle-hardened midfielder Jim Goodwin only for the Irishman to return the favour and happily point out that the scores between the pair were now level.

Villa exited at the break, one of nine changes while Stevie Thompson came off for the designated visitors.

Despite the mass substitutions the MLS side found another gear and deservedly doubled their lead when Tony Taylor nipped in behind the Saints defence to emphatically volley a second.

That was that and the players exited to the strains of Bruce Springsteen's Born in the USA.

Elephant in the room aside, officials will have been pleased with a winning debut.

This was not Manhattan this was Manchester but Jason Kreis's men made themselves at home and appeared well-drilled for a hastily put together team.

They will be back at the CFA to take on Danish outfit Brondby before kicking off their season against fellow new boys Orlando.

Coach Kreis believes Lampard's expected arrival, in June or July, will give his men a shot in the arm as they look to make the play-offs in their debut season.

On the evidence of this knockabout, he might be right.
