Stepping in as a late replacement for Stephen Thompson, Benson Henderson makes his UFC debut in the welterweight division on Saturday night, when he faces off against devastating finisher and fellow Coloradoan Brandon Thatch.

Coming into the fight off the back of two losses in the lightweight bracket, former champion Henderson will take the leap up a weight class, in what will be the five-round main event in his home town.

'We had been contemplating the move to 170lb a lot,' Henderson told Sportsmail. 'It is pretty tough to take the weight off sometimes. Not having to cut weight will definitely be a positive.

Henderson plans to return to lightweight in the future despite moving up to take on Thatch

'I will be giving up a little strength and size, but I've sparred with plenty of top 170 guys at our gym. I will be a little bit faster, quicker, agile and more athletic than the 170 guys.'

For the first time, Henderson, who usually has a size advantage over his counterparts at 155lbs, will be the smaller fighter in the Octagon when he meets Thatch at the 1st Bank Center.

Nevertheless, the MMA Lab fighter insists that he will return to lightweight after the fight:

'This is not a permanent move to 170. I'll be back at 155,' he said. 'This was just me stepping up for an opportunity. There are some other 170 match-ups that interest me, but I'm probably not staying at 170.'

Thatch, standing at 6'2', is also well aware of the size advantage that he will command inside the Octagon: 'I'm a bigger, longer fighter,' he said. 'I feel like as long as I keep him on the end of my jab and stay long, I'll be successful in this fight.'

A dynamic striker, Thatch has dispatched his first two opponents since signing with the UFC, with finishes over Paulo Thiago and Justin Edwards in the first round. In his 11 pro MMA bouts to date, Thatch has competently finished each of his opponents in the opening round. 

And while headlining a fight card of this scale might present an added pressure for the 29-year-old, he is confident that he can utilise this to his advantage.

'Being the main event in Colorado – it's pressure but it's good pressure and I do well under pressure. I've fought many a time here as the main event in Colorado so it's nothing new to me.

'Where would a third straight win in the UFC take me? You tell me where that would take me. Wherever it takes me. If I keep winning in an impressive manner then the outcome is going to handle itself and I'm going to continue to progress in this sport.'
