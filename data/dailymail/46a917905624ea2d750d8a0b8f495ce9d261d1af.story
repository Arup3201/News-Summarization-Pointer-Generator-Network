The British militant 'Jihadi John' was chosen to execute Americans James Foley and Steven Sotloff because it would make other Westerners feel part of ISIS cause, a fighter who defected from the group has said.

The former insurgent, in his 20s and now based in Turkey, said Jihadi John helped to showcase ISIS to Western recruits.

He said: 'It is possible that the goal was to project the image that a European or a Western person executed an American so that they can showcase their Western members and appeal to others outside Syria and make them feel that they belong to the same cause and that they too can do anything in support of ISIS in their respective countries.'

The British militant known as 'Jihadi John' was purposely chosen to kill American journalist Steven Sotloff (pictured) to appeal to other disenfranchised Westerners, according to a former ISIS fighter

Prime Minister David Cameron today vowed to 'squeeze' ISIS out of existence and indicated that he may be willing to use the RAF to bomb the terrorist organisation.

He also said that the terrorist, known as Jihad John, believed to be responsible for the murder of the two US journalists, will face justice 'one way or another'.

The fanatic, who has a multicultural London accent, killed Mr Foley in a video released two weeks ago and Mr Sotloff - like Mr Foley a journalist - in a clip released earlier this week.

The ISIS defector told CNN the principle goal of the organisation was to establish an Islamic state first in the Middle East, and then extend it to the rest of the world.

A former ISIS fighter said western militants, such as those pictured, consider their home countries 'infidels'

He added that Western recruits were especially valuable because they turn on their home countries and are willing to carry out attacks there. 

He added: 'Since Western fighters joined ISIS they consider their home country as infidels.

'If they have a chance they will carry out attacks because they consider it an infidel country and it should be fought.'

It's believed there are about 500 Britons currently enlisted within ISIS ranks in Syria and Iraq and the numbers are growing daily.

To combat the threat they pose, Theresa May, the Home Secretary, raised the terror threat level from substantial to severe on Friday and Mr Cameron has proposed laws barring its citizens returning to Britain if they are found to have joined ISIS' ranks.
