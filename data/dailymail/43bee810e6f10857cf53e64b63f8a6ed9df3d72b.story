A father-of-one was allegedly killed with a single blow during a 'Punch for Punch' game - which has become a new social media craze -  at a birthday party.

Desmond Bartley, 20, is accused of delivering the fatal blow to 23-year-old Tommy Main while they were at a party in south London, and has been charged with his manslaughter.

Mr Main, of Erith, south east London, suffered a fatal cardiac arrest at the birthday party at a house across the road from his home last June after taking part in the 'Punch 4 Punch' challenge.

The internet craze involves two people, both with one hand tied behind their back, trading blows with each other over and over again until one backs down. The footage of the challenge is then posted online and shared on social media.

Bartley, wearing a turquoise hooded jumper, appeared at Bexley Magistrates' Court today. 

He spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth.

About a dozen friends and members of his family were also in the court room for the hearing.

Tommy Main, 23, died after he went to a birthday party opposite his home in Erith in south east London

Police were called to the house in Erith by paramedics at 12.45am on June 29 last year to reports of a collapsed man.

Mr Main, 23, was taken to hospital in south London where he died a short while later.

A post-mortem examination at the Princess Royal Hospital gave the case of death as a heart attack following a blunt chest impact.

Bartley was arrested and was previously bailed pending further inquiries before being charged on Sunday.

He was remanded in custody to appear at Inner London Crown Court on February 16.
