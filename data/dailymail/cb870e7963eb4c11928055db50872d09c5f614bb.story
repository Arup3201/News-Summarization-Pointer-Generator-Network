Handheld game controllers are so 2014... this year its set to be all about playing using your feet.

A pair of French designers has created the 3DRudder that uses feet to control characters on a connected computer.

To move forward, the user tilts the device away from them, while moving left and right on the screen involves tilting the 3DRudder in the relevant direction.

The 3DRudder (pictured) connects to Windows computers and Macs. To move forward, the user tilts the device away from them, while moving left and right involves tilting the 3DRudder in the relevant direction. There is also a pedal that lets users move characters on a screen either up or down

It is the brainchild of Stanislas Chesnais and Valerio Bonora and the pair has set up an Indiegogo campaign to fund production of the $130 (£85) gadget.

‘For thirty years we have been asked to move in digital worlds and environments with our hands,’ said the campaign.

Diameter: 14.57-inches (37cm)

Height: 3.15-inches (8cm)

Weight: 4lbs (2kg)

Maximum load: 286lbs (130kg) 

Compatibility: PCs running Windows 7 and 8 and above and Macs running OS X Yosemite and above.

‘The issue is they were not designed for movement: to point yes, to move no. 

'And there is no physiological scheme for movement involving the hands.’

‘Through the efficient use of both our hands and feet, we were [once] able to gain a tremendous amount of power. So, why not put our feet to work in the 3D computer world?’

The device is used while seated.

In addition to the directional movements, rotating the device moves characters in a similar way to the analog sticks found on PlayStation and Xbox controllers.

There is also a pedal that lets users move either up or down.

The 3DRudder connects to a PC running Windows 7 and 8 and above via USB. It also works with Macs running OS X Yosemite and above.

The 3DRudder is the brainchild of Stanislas Chesnais and Valerio Bonora and the pair has set up an Indiegogo campaign to fund production of the $130 (£85) gadget. The campaign runs until 18 January and has raised more than $16,665 (£10,970) of its $50,000 (£32,960) goal

This means it also works with existing games, because it emulates the keyboard keys or a joystick.

Plus, the designers explained it will also work with virtual reality headsets.

The campaign runs until 18 January and has raised more than $16,665 (£10,970) of its $50,000 (£32,960) goal.

Single 3DRudder’s cost $130 (£85), while dual packs start at $250 (£164) and models are expected to ship in May, as long as the campaign is funded.

It is currently being showcased at this year's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.
