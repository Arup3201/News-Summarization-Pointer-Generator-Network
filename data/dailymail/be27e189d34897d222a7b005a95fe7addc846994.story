Dariusz Miakienko, 46, who is alleged to have killed mother-of-two Naudel Turner in Tottenham on Wednesday

This is the first picture of the man who is alleged to have brutally murdered a mother-of-two in a knife attack.

Dariusz Miakienko, 46, appeared before Highbury Corner Magistrates Court charged with the murder of Naudel Turner.

The 42-year-old healthcare worker was repeatedly stabbed in the neck on Bruce Grove, Tottenham, on Wednesday afternoon.

Grey-haired Miakienko appeared in the dock wearing a long grey t-shirt.

He spoke only to confirm his name and age through a Polish interpreter.

Deputy District Judge Kevin Gladwell told Miakienko: 'Because of the nature of the offence, I transfer the case to the Central Criminal Court.

'You will make your first appearance in custody on Monday.'

Detectives are still investigating the nature of the pair's relationship as Miakienko’s neighbours on Lordship Lane, Tottenham, claimed they regularly saw him with Mrs Turner.

Shopkeeper Burcin Yurga said they came in together to buy wine.

He said: ‘She went to his house a lot so I thought they were in a relationship.

‘When he wasn’t with her he would come in to buy beer. If they were together, they would buy wine.

‘He didn’t seem to work and she seemed to look after him.’

A local restaurant owner, who did not want to be named, said: ‘They were always together, but I haven't seen her for two weeks or so mind you.’

The woman also claimed that a man in his fifties had been in recently to look for his wife.

She said: ‘A man used to come in here often, most weekends in fact.

'And one time I asked him what he was doing.'

Police were last night asking shopkeepers near Miakienko’s address for their CCTV footage.
