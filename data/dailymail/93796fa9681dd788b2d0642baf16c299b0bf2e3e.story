NFL release statement in support of 24-year-old

The All-American defensive end set to be picked in 2014 Draft in May

Michael Sam could become the NFL’s first openly homosexual player, after revealing he is gay.

The All-American defensive end from Missouri revealed the news in interviews with ESPN and the New York Times. Sam said his team-mates and coaches have known since August.

‘I am an openly, proud gay man,’ the 24-year-old said.

Happy: Michael Sam has revealed he is openly-gay ahead of his probable introduction to the NFL in 2014

The 255-pound Sam participated in the Senior Bowl in Alabama last month after leading the SEC - America’s best college conference - in sacks (11.5) and tackles for loss (19).

The SEC’s defensive player of the year, Sam and is eligible for May’s draft and is projected to be a mid-round pick.

‘It's a big deal. No one has done this before. And it's kind of a nervous process, but I know what I want to be ... I want to be a football player in the NFL,’ he said.

‘We admire Michael Sam's honesty and courage,’ the NFL said in statement.

‘Michael is a football player. Any player with ability and determination can succeed in the NFL. We look forward to welcoming and supporting Michael Sam in 2014.’

Sam said many people at the college all-star game for NFL prospects seemed to know that he was gay.

Support: The NFL released a statement backing the Missouri Tigers man

‘I didn't realise how many people actually knew, and I was afraid that someone would tell or leak something out about me,’ he told ESPN. ‘I want to own my truth. No one else should tell my story but me.’

Before coming out to all his teammates and coaches, Sam said he told a few close friends and dated another Missouri athlete who was not a football player.

‘Coaches just wanted to know a little about ourselves, our majors, where we're from, and something that no one knows about you,’ Sam said. ‘And I used that opportunity just to tell them that I was gay. And their reaction was like: “Michael Sam finally told us”.’

Respect: Sam has also received support from his coach and team-mates

Missouri coach Gary Pinkel said in a statement: ‘Michael is a great example of just how important it is to be respectful of others, he's taught a lot of people here first-hand that it doesn't matter what your background is, or your personal orientation, we're all on the same team and we all support each other.

‘If Michael doesn't have the support of his teammates like he did this past year, I don't think there's any way he has the type of season he put together.’

Missouri linebacker Donovan Bonner has been a teammate of Sam's for five years.

Coming out: Former Leeds United soccer player Robbie Rogers announced he was gay last year as did NBA player Jason Collins

‘We knew of his status for 5 years and not one team member, coach, or staff member said anything says a lot about our family atmosphere,’ Bonner tweeted.

Many NFL players have come out after the conclusion of their careers, including Kwame Harris and Dave Kopay.

Last year, NBA player Jason Collins announced he was gay after the season. Collins was a free agent and has not signed with a new team this season.

Former Leeds United soccer player Robbie Rogers also came out a year ago.
