A 20-year-old man, named as Zikarious Jaquan Flint, was shot dead by authorities on the campus of Columbus State University in Georgia yesterday.

Flint's family members say that the 20-year-old was seen running away when he was shot but campus authorities said that they responded to reports that someone had been seen loading a gun.

Campus authorities said that the man was not a student at the school and that the campus, some 100 miles southwest of Atlanta, was not put on lockdown.

The man has been named by local newspaper, Ledger Inquirer, as Zikarious Jaquan Flint.

The paper said that Flint was confirmed dead at 3:29 p.m, local time, on Sunday in the Midtown Medical Center in Columbus by Muscogee County Coroner Buddy Bryan.

University Police Chief Rus Drew told 
The Associated Press that officers were called at 2:35 p.m. Sunday and 
arrived three minutes later to an area near some campus apartments and 
began chasing the man on foot.

'There
 was a short foot chase and at some point the suspect turned and faced 
the officers and shots were fired,' Mr Drew said by phone.

He added that 
while there were some student witnesses, no lockdown was ordered because
 events unfolded rapidly and authorities had determined that an 'isolated threat' had been removed.

Today, in an official statement to television channel WTVM, he said: 'A person in our housing area, our student housing area, who had a gun out, loading the gun.

'Officers were dispatched, when officers arrived there was a brief foot chase.  

Police are still investigating at Columbus State University after community police officers at the university shot a 20-year-old dead

Pictured here is one of the buildings at Columbus State University. A 20-year-old man was shot dead by university officials at Columbus State outside a student residence. University police alleged that there had been reports of a man loading a gun. They claimed that the man then lifted his arm, which is when police decided to shoot

'When they did confront the suspect there were shots fired.'

A spokesman for the university, John Lester, told the Ledger that officers confronted the suspect but when they ran after him, he faced the officers and lifted his arm - at which point the officers shot the man.

Yesterday, a tweet from the 
university's Twitter page read: 'Police shot a man (NOT a student) today
 after responding to CY1 of a report of a man w/a (sic) gun. The man ran
 but turned threateningly'

But the Flint family have told the paper, through their attorney Stacey Jackson, that three witnesses said Flint was still running when he was shot.

Mr Jackson also said that some witnesses had alleged that Flint was not armed.

The Ledger has reported that the parents have not been allowed to see their son's body. Mr Jackson said that Flint had been with a group of friends visiting students at the university.

Mr Jackson told WTVM that there are cameras near the scene and he hopes that CCTV footage of events will be available.

Mr Drew added that no students appeared to have been placed in potential danger though he said there were some student witnesses.

Campus officials declined to say how many students were in the apartments or nearby at the time.

Bill Sutley, a university spokesman, later told AP in a statement that campus police had received a report of a man seen loading a gun near the apartments before the chase and that he had been shot by officers.

He said he had no further details about the shooting or why the man was on campus.

The university statement added that a local coroner's office had confirmed to campus police that the man was later pronounced dead at a hospital where he had been taken by ambulance at 3:15 p.m.

The university said it was cooperating with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, a state law enforcement agency that routinely investigates police-involved shootings.  It also said counselors would be made available to students if needed.

'This is a terrible tragedy,' CSU Tim Mescon said. 'We'll cooperate fully with the investigation ... Our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone involved in this as well as their families.'

The university, situated near the Georgia line with Alabama, said on its online site that it has more than 8,200 students enrolled in numerous degree programs. The campus is located in downtown Columbus, some 100 miles from Atlanta.
