Millions of shoppers will be spending Christmas Eve pounding the streets for last-minute gifts with more than £800million predicted to go through the tills.

Half of British adults have left some of their festive shopping until today, according to a survey.

Sainsbury’s Bank, for whom the poll was done, has estimated 11 per cent of the week’s shopping will take place in the final hours of trading - down from 22 per cent last year.

But 23.6million people are expected to shop today compared with 17.5million last year, spending up to £832million.

Meanwhile the traditional Boxing Day sales were starting two days early today, with the clamour for the best deals beginning as early as 6am - when the first major retailer started to slash its prices.

Other stores were joining in during the day with deals of up to 70 per cent off in a battle for sales after an unexpected slowdown in spending.

The frenzy will continue through Christmas Day, when cyber-shoppers are expected to spend a record £636million - or £441,000 a minute - in the hunt for online bargains.

The number of visits to internet stores tomorrow will soar to 142million, a 25 per cent jump from last year, Britain’s online retailer association the IMRG predicts.

Debenhams’ sale went live from 6am, with John Lewis, Next, House of Fraser, Marks & Spencer and many more launching theirs throughout today.

Simon Ranson, head of banking at Sainsbury’s Bank, said: ‘It appears that fewer people are leaving all of their shopping to the last minute. However our research shows there could be a rising number who are hitting the shops for one or two further gifts or last-minute items.’

John Lewis said last week’s sales of £160.6million, up 6.5 per cent on the previous week, confirmed its expectation of customers choosing to leave their Christmas shopping until the last minute.

The department store’s retail director, Andrew Murphy, said: ‘Last week we said it’s all to play for, and that is still absolutely the case as we have seen a building trend of customers leaving their gift purchases right up until the last minute.

‘Busy though our shops have been over the past week, it’s only in these final pre-Christmas days that many customers are finally moving to complete their gift buying and other purchases.

‘Consequently our partners are standing ready for a very busy final trading day before the festive break.’

Fenwick of Bond Street has set up a pop-up gifting service that guarantees to help the ‘last minute man’ find the ideal gift in just five minutes, right up until 5pm tonight.

The service’s popularity reached a high on Monday when more than 10 bottles of Chanel No5 sold every hour.

David Walker-Smith, managing director at Fenwick of Bond Street, said: ‘We understand how men like to shop, and the guarantee of finding something fabulous in a short space of time has provided considerable relief at what can be a stressful time of year for shoppers.

The New West End Company is predicting £20million will go through the tills today across the West End, with retailers extending their hours to as late as 8pm.

The Co-operative has said that the last-minute shopping list is most likely to include fizzy drink, lemons and limes, a selection box, prosecco and mince pies.

Andrew Mann, customer director for The Co-operative Food said: ‘We are expecting intense trading in the last few hours before Christmas as people re-stock or seek last-minute items.

‘On average consumers will shop for food every day in the five days leading up to Christmas as fresh lines become available in store.’
