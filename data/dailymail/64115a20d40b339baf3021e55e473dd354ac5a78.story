British Airways tries to pride itself on ensuring passengers make it comfortably from one location to another - but even if the plane gets there, sometimes the people on board do not.

And a new documentary has revealed how staff at the airline have been warned not to hide dead bodies in the toilet during a flight - because it is both undignified and a safety hazard.

Cameras have filmed training sessions for BBC2 programme A Very British Airline, showing how crews are taught to deal with medical emergencies in the sky.

In the cabin: Staff at the airline have been warned not to hide dead bodies in the toilet during a flight

Admitting that managing a dead body during a flight is a ‘grey area’, a lead trainer tells new staff: ‘You cannot put a dead passenger in the toilet. It’s not respectful and it’s not strapped in for landing.

‘If they slid off the toilet, they would end up on the floor. You would have to take the aircraft apart to get that person out. Imagine putting someone in the aircraft toilet?’

According to The Independent, she added that one former solution employed by BA staff was to prop up dead customers in their seats and pretend they were sleeping.

She said: ‘It’s what we used to do many years ago – give them a vodka and tonic... and eye-shades and they were like, they’re fine. We don’t do that.’

The trainer added that she knew a member of crew who once had to sit next to a dead passenger for the rest of a flight. The bodies are often moved to an empty seat in first or business class.

But they are told not to put dead passengers in the toilets because of the problems caused by rigor mortis setting in - making it very difficult to remove the body from a small space.

On the ground: The documentary looks at how some of BA's 40,000 staff work to meet the airline’s standards

Training: The show, which starts next Monday, follows the training of new recruits Alice, Patrick and Jodi

The documentary looks at how some of BA's 40,000 staff work to meet the airline’s standards, in the backdrop of the business facing financial problems and increased competition. 

'If they slid off the toilet, they would end up on the floor. You would have to take the aircraft apart to get that person out'

The first episode looks at ‘millionaire’s door’ at London Heathrow Terminal Five, which includes a lounge, restaurant, spa and champagne bar reserved for those who fly in first class.

The show, which is narrated by Green Wing and Episodes actor Stephen Mangan, follows the training of new recruits Alice, Patrick and Jodi.

BBC2 documentaries commissioner Emma Willis said: ‘This three-part series will capture the immense complexities of a business that powers the nation and will offer a unique insight into British Airways’ future.’

Nick Catliff, managing director for production company Lion Television, said: ‘BA is a business of course, but it’s also an iconic British institution with a unique culture and history.’
