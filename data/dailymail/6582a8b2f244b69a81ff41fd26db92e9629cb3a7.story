Brazil 2014: The gang of international ticket touts have worked their scam over four World Cups

Brazilian police have broken up a gang of international ticket touts arresting 11 people in a scam worth £52million ($90m) and covering four World Cups.

The police said that the man they suspect of being the leader of the gang, Mohamadou Lamine Fofana, was an Algerian national who ‘had free access to restricted Fifa areas’.

They have also said that they believe a Fifa official is involved in the illegal resale of tickets some of which were allocated to players. Others were intended for sponsors and Brazil team officials. Police believe some of the tickets were sold to foreign tourists.

Fofana is in the country for the tournament and was staying at the Copacabana Palace hotel, where all Fifa’s top executives are staying.

Fifa released a statement late last night that said they would help the Brazilian authorities but its spokesman said that they have yet to receive any information from police identifying their official who allegedly helped the ring.

‘Maybe it's not from Fifa,’ said Delia Fischer. ‘It's often easy to come to a conclusion about who is Fifa.’

Ticket for the Spain versus Chile in this year's World Cup - tickets for the competition were part of a huge scam covering four World Cups

Earlier this week police executed 20 search warrants simultaneously in Operation Jules Rimet – he was the president of Fifa and the first World Cup trophy was named after him.

The suspected official, said Rio policeman Fabio Barucke, has clearance for Fifa offices, stadiums and other administrative areas where he would have access to game tickets.

‘[Fofana] has tickets from hospitality, from Match, and he was close friends with someone from Fifa who was in the middle of that negotiation - who was helping out with that negotiation.’ he said.

Mr Barucke said that the suspects confessed to running the con at four World Cups.

‘The gang goes to the host country. It's possible that they only work during the World Cups as their profit is so large they can sit back in between [tournaments].’

Those arrested could face charges of money laundering, criminal association and illegally
