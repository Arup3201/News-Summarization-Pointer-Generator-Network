A former gymnast who represented her country numerous times and won medals for her skills has now been exposed as a high-class prostitute who earns £1,000 a night.

Florica Leonida, 27, from the Romanian capital Bucharest, says she gave up a further career in gymnastics where she would have earned a few hundred euros a month as a coach to work for the world's oldest profession instead. 

She said it was the only way to make ends meets.

Desperate: Florica Leonida, 27, from the Romanian capital Bucharest, said becoming a prostitute was the only way to make ends meets

A former silver world medallist, and silver European medallist she also won gold on the beam and three silver medals at the 2002 Junior European Championships.

But after giving up the gymnastics, Florica, who is also known to friends as Floarea, became a prostitute in Germany before moving to neighbouring Austria.

She works in the sex industry under a different name, currently residing with another girl in a Viennese brothel.

In the photos on the brothel website, Florica covers her eyes so she will not be recognised. She changed her name after Romanian media found out about her recently and now operates under the pseudonym Sascha Brown.

In Germany she earned between 7,000-8,000 euros (£5,600 - 6,400) per week although in Austria it is likely to be less.

She sends about half of the amount to her family in Romania, and with the rest she pays the rent and buys clothes.

According to Romanian media, she reportedly has five to six clients per night then takes breakfast and drinks coffee in the nearby Galleria shopping centre.

She goes out again in the afternoon to have lunch, then goes to the Crazy Sun tanning salon, then returns to the room, where she is available for customers until next day.

Florica usually spends a week in Vienna, then goes to Linz. After another week spent there, she moves to Villach, to visit other sex clients. 

‘I need to make ends meet,’ she told a friend. ‘I do what I have to do.’
