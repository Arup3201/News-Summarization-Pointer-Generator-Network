A woman who found fame as the 'Attractive Convict' after her DUI mugshot circulated around the world is suing a firm for using her image.

Meagan Simmons, 28, became the subject of hundreds of internet memes after a police mugshot showing her in an orange jumpsuit with tousled hair earned her the flattering nickname.

Countless websites posted memes featuring the police shot, taken in Florida in July 2010, with captions such as 'GUILTY - of taking my breath away', 'Arrested for breaking and entering - YOUR HEART' and 'Tell me what she did so I can end up in the same jail'.

Simmons is now suing Instantcheckmate.com a website that offers background checks of public and criminal records for using her image 'for financial gain'.

Last year, the separated mother of four was interviewed by Daily Mail and revealed she thinks the picture is 'terrible' but has had dozens of requests for dates from single men since it began circulating.

'I don't think it's that good a picture. There are other ones I would prefer,' she said.

But the medical assistant from Zephyrhills, Florida, has had enough and is suing  InstantCheckmate.com for using her image without payment or permission.

In the suit, Simmons alleges the exposure has disturbed her peace of mind, invaded her privacy and caused her anguish

She declined to comment to the Tampa Bay Times but her attorney, Matthew Crist, likened the issue to Colgate using Tom Cruise's image to sell toothpaste without his permission.

He said: 'At
 the end of the day, this is actually about intellectual property.

'If someone is going to use your image, they need to pay you
 for it.

'The legal issue is it's your face, and 
your name.

'You own it,' he said. 'You can use it, you control it and 
when someone misappropriates it â€” that's when you're violating Florida 
law.'

The advert at the centre of the legal arguement shows Simmons' mugshot with the caption 'Sometimes the cute 
ones aren't that innocent.'

Mr Crist stressed the issue with InstantCheckmate.com's use of his client's image was that it was being used for obvious financial gain.

In the suit, Simmons alleges the exposure has disturbed her peace of mind, invaded her privacy and caused her anguish.

The suit seeks monetary damages and an injunction to prevent further use of her picture.
