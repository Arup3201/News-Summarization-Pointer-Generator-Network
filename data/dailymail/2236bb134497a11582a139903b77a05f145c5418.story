A father-of-three who suffered burns to 40 percent of his body and spent six weeks in a coma after a horrific accident that saw his ute catch fire, says the crash was the ‘luckiest day’ of his life.

Jamie Manning, 39, has had 22 operations and counting since the crash that left him with a broken and dislocated hip, eight broken ribs and four broken vertebrae.

And his left leg and fingers on one hand have now been amputated due to the severity of his burns.

But Mr Manning – a bull-riding farmer from near Dubbo, NSW - has refused to let the crash dampen his spirits and has stunned doctors with his incredibly quick recovery.

Miracle man: Jamie Manning, with his wife Karen, has amazed doctors with his progress since he was involved in an horrific car crash in March which left him with terrible burns

Speaking to the MailOnline from Sydney on his first weekend out of hospital in 14 weeks, Mr Manning said: 'People say it was bad luck but my wife Karen and I both look at it as the luckiest day of my life. I could have been at the side of the road for an hour before I was found and burned to death.'

He said he is 'taking that positive out of everything' and is not the type of person to 'sit in the corner and sulk'.

The crash happened at about 6pm on March 27 during a car journey that Mr Manning used to take every day. But on that day, it changed his life and has led to an incredible survival story which has left doctors ‘amazed’.

He was only 3km from his house, along the road that he lived on with his family, when he swerved to avoid a truck that was coming round the corner.

'I'd been at work and had a big day. I was heading home when I got a phone call from a mate to give him a hand, so I was driving there when it happened.

'The last thing I remember is driving round the corner and a truck coming on my side of the road and I moved to give it more space,' Jamie said.

His car crashed and burst into flames.

Jamie was found 'almost straight away' after the crash as there was a car driving behind him.

Fight for survival: Jamie suffered 40 per cent burns in the accident and had to have a leg and the fingers on one hand amputated due to the severity of the injuries

But, it was 20 minutes before anyone was able to pull him out of the car - a 2000 Ford Falcon ute - because his leg was trapped in the seatbelt.

First an elderly man tried to get him out; he had to run to the nearest house to get help. The neighbour couldn’t rescue Jamie either, so they went to the next house along and found a man who was about 120 kilograms who managed to finally free Jamie from the burning wreckage.

'I can’t imagine how brave you have to be to pull someone out of a car that is about to explode and put your own life on the line,’ Jamie’s wife Karen said.

And Jamie joked: 'I bought them a pocket knife for next time.'

Karen had the shock of her life after getting a 'bad gut feeling' when Jamie was late home from work.

She jumped into her car after a friend had phoned and told her there were fire engines and an ambulance going down her road. She was devastated to find Jamie's burning car, believing for a moment that he was still trapped inside it.

'I thought he was dead, I broke down and sat on the road,' Karen said.

'Then a fella that was there said he’d already gone in the ambulance.’ 

Jamie doesn’t remember much about the crash or the past three months in hospital because of his bleeding on the brain and has only now started to get his memory back within the last two weeks.

Karen said while Jamie was in a coma for about six weeks the doctors tried to ‘prepare her for the worst’.

‘I always stayed pretty positive but they were always unsure about is head injuries. I was confident he would be fine.’

Progress: The bull rider was not meant to be out of hospital before Christmas but, with the support of Karen, he can soon be a day patient

When he woke up from his coma, Karen said it took Jamie weeks before he became aware of where he was and she was constantly repeating what had happened so that he understood.

‘Every hour he would need to me to remind him of the conversation, just because of the amount of drugs and the head injuries he had.’

A thankful Jamie added: ‘There wasn’t one moment she doubted I’d come good.’

Jamie and Karen have been together for 21 years after meeting when they were 18 at Tocal Agricultural College, and Karen has spent her every waking hour at the hospital – even relocating their sons to Sydney, with the help of distance education, so they can be together.

‘Karen was by my side from day one. She was there when I woke up, she didn’t leave my side. She’s a very strong woman,’ Jamie said.

‘She told me about when she came across the crash and the car and I felt bad for putting her through that,’ he added.

Karen said their children Jedd, 12, Braydon, 10 and Lori, 5, have ‘found it a bit tough as they are country boys and aren’t used to running around in a city with concrete and people everywhere’.

What is almost even more remarkable than Jamie’s survival story is his incredibly positive outlook on life.

Talking about how things will be different for him now, the burns victim explained: ‘I know it’s going to change my life but I know we’re going to have a happy life.’

Today it takes Jamie about two-and-a-half hours to get ready in the morning as he has to massage his burns.

‘It will take 18 months to two years for the skin to stop contracting… you get lines in the skin you have to massage that all out,’ he explained.

His proud wife added: ‘The nurses come in to say it’s time to do something and he’s already done it.’

The couple hope Jamie’s staggeringly quick recovery means he can soon be a day patient at the Graythwaite Rehabilitation Centre in Sydney’s north-west – despite doctors originally claiming he wouldn’t be out of hospital before Christmas.

‘The doctors are pretty amazed. I think it’s the support from my wife and community that’s helped.

‘In rehab they are at a bit of loss at what they can still do for me,’ he joked.

However, Jamie does still need to have half a dozen operations for his eyes and face.

‘I can’t shut my eyelids as they are burnt pretty badly. They need to do more skin grafts,’ he explained.

Karen said it’s ‘probably harder’ for her to see Jamie sleeping with his eyes open than it is for him to get to sleep.

‘When he first came round from the coma I only knew he was asleep if his eyes were rolled back in his head,’ she said.

Since the accident, Jamie said he’s become ‘more of a family man’ and Karen has noticed how family time is now more ‘precious’ to him.

But the former horse racer, who owns about a dozen horses, is keen to get back on his horse ‘as soon as possible’... although he admitted he might have to take it slower now there are ‘two steel rods’ in his back.

The former professional bull-rider, who broke a Guinness World Record for the longest time on a mechanical bull with two minutes and four seconds, believes he also has a high-pain threshold to thank for his quick recovery.

‘I used to ride bulls and get knocks from that and then go to work Monday,’ he explained.

Jamie's local community has set up the Jamie Manning Recovery Auction and in May raised $65,000 to help cover the costs of modifying Jamie's home to make it wheelchair friendly.

Meanwhile, Jamie has his eye on getting a quad bike so he can drive around his farm 'to check on stock and check fences'.

'I'm not going to sit in the house and do nothing,' he said.
