What's Jose Mourinho’s secret to keeping his fringe players happy?

Despite the abundance of world-class talent at his disposal, Mourinho has resisted the temptation to fiddle with his starting line-up too much this season.

This is obviously working, with just one defeat in all competitions since the start of the season.

Jose Mourinho has resisted the temptation to fiddle with his starting line-up too much this season 

But why is it that, unlike other clubs, you don’t hear a peep out of those players who are not regularly in Chelsea’s starting XI?

Filipe Luis, a £16million signing from Atletico Madrid who won La Liga and finished runner-up in the Champions League last season, has started three Premier League games.

Goalkeeper Petr Cech, one of the major figures in Chelsea’s modern era, has made just one league start following Thibaut Courtois’ arrival at the club.

John Mikel Obi, another multiple medal winner at Stamford Bridge, is not playing and there are more high-profile stars who will be warming the bench this Christmas.

Yet, there have been virtually no declarations of frustration or unhappiness under Mourinho (right), whose side travel to Stoke tonight.

Mourinho said: ‘It’s not difficult for me to leave players out. Everybody has to be ready to sacrifice for the team, to give everything for the team, not to be selfish.

‘This is the way I want a team to be. Mikel, for example, it was the first time he played against Newcastle and he was our best player.

‘How can he be our best player if he didn’t play in three months? Because he was working every day at the top level.

‘Are the players sad, frustrated, not happy? Maybe, but professional. There is no secret. Players need to be patient. I don’t have a secret.

‘The reality is that, to be professional and work at a high level, you don’t need to be happy. Mark Schwarzer hasn’t played a second but if he has to play tomorrow he would be ready.’

The silence from his players is even more incredible given Mourinho does not offer those who have been left out any explanation why.

‘I just put the team up. Do I explain it? No,’ said the Portuguese. ‘It’s my decision. Players may not be happy or not agree with the decision, but they know my decision is not to favour somebody or to punish somebody.

‘It’s what I think is best for the team at a certain moment. I don’t give explanations to players unless they ask me for one.

‘If they ask me to explain, no problem. If they ask, I’ll explain. I had one who asked, knocking on my door asking why someone else was playing instead of him. I said he was playing better, closed door, goodbye.’

Stoke manager Mark Hughes, a Chelsea player in the pre-Mourinho era, says his old club have the strength in depth to win an unprecedented quadruple of Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup and Capital One Cup.

‘It wouldn’t surprise me,’ he said. ‘It’s a big ask — a lot of things have to go your way (but) they are strong enough. You just sense their belief.

‘Some very good teams will try and stand in the way but they have a chance — a better chance than most teams.’
