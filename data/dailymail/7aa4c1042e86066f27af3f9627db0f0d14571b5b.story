He might keep changing continents but Kevin Pietersen's fortunes in 2014 show no sign of altering.

The former England batsman was left cursing his luck after a spectacular Martin Guptill catch on the boundary ended his second Caribbean Premier League innings for St Lucia for just seven.

Pietersen has had a rollercoaster year, losing the Ashes in Australia then being sacked by England and struggling in the Indian Premier League and the NatWest T20 Blast.

Spectacular: Guptill takes the ball one-handed while airborne to end Pietersen's innings on seven

Rough ride: Pietersen is having a torrid year and averages just 23.30 in Twenty20s in 2014

Drowning his sorrows: Pietersen drinking with Chris Gayle following the match

In 25 Twenty20 innings in 2014, Pietersen has scored 536 runs at an average of just 23.30.

To make things worse for the 34-year-old, St Lucia fell to an eight-wicket defeat by Guptill's Guyana.

He seemed to have recovered enough of his humour by the evening, however, being pictured drinking with his good friend Chris Gayle.
