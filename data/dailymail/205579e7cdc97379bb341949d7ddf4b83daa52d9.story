Devastation: A three-year-old girl has died and 17 have been injured after a main water pipe ruptured in a residential area in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

Aerial footage from local media shows the water powering through and destroying residential homes in the poor western district of Campo Grande

Some 17 houses crumbled because of the flooding, and more than 140 people were forced out of their homes.

Firefighters have had to use floating platforms to rescue people who had been trapped by the rising flood water.

Isabella Severo dos Santos was named by local media as the child who drowned in the incident. Footage shows how the incessant barrage of water also destroyed her family home.

The Globo television network ran images 
of a first responder wading through knee-high water 
carrying little Isabela in his arms.

Homes have been reduced to rubble by the surge of water, which killed a three-year-old girl

The water pipe exploded in a built up poor area of western Rio de Janeiro

One distraught woman tells the camera: 'Here it is, I'm a hard working woman, I am a fighter. I ended up okay, but Isabella, how did it come to this? Three years old.'

The freak accident happened in the poor Campo Grande district, located in the west of the city. 

The spurt of water that resulted from the rupture reached a height of around 20meters (65ft), flooding the neighborhood with water up to 2meters (6ft) high in places, the network said.

The cause of the break was not immediately clear. 

Cars were tossed like toys by the powerful torrent of water which swept away numerous homes

Rescuers had to find boats and floating platforms to help access those trapped by the flood water

During a visit by Rio Gov. Sergio Cabral, residents brandished signs berating the beleaguered official.

Cabral, who has seen his popularity plummet since mass nationwide protests swept Brazil in June, visited a local school where those displaced by the floodwaters had been taken. Speaking to gathered TV cameras, he pledged to give all possible assistance to those affected by the flood.

The incident came a day after Cabral appealed to critics to call off the protests they've been staging in front of his beachfront Rio apartment on and off since June. 

Cabral said the demonstrations were disrupting the lives of his children, ages six and 11, and suggested the protests would be more appropriate in front of the governor's palace, his place of work.

The cause of the break was not immediately clear

Tensions are already high in the city after demonstrators alleged that leader Cabral is corrupt and called for his impeachment

'I'm making an appeal from the heart, as a father,' Cabral said at a news conference Monday. 

The demonstrators allege Cabral is corrupt and are calling for his impeachment, as well as an investigation into spending on the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics, which Rio is hosting. 

A poll by the Datafolha agency said Cabral's popularity has plummeted by 30 percentage points in the space of a few weeks. The poll showing his popularity fell from 55 points to 25 percent, was conducted on June 27 and 28 among 605 respondents and had a margin of error of plus or minus four points.

Clean up: The huge operation to clean up the poor neighbourhood has begun

Cabral belongs to the centrist PMDB party, which is allied with the Worker's Party of President Dilma Rousseff, whose popularity has also taken a beating since the start of the protests. 

A 10-cent hike in bus and subway fares in Sao Paulo initially triggered the wave of mass demonstrations, which rapidly snowballed into nationwide movement over a simmering public dissatisfaction about a disparate set of issues including government corruption, high taxes and poor government services.
