The demise of Wayne Rooney, it seems, has been greatly exaggerated once again.

Not for the first time in his career, the Manchester United striker's longevity as a top level footballer had been questioned this summer in the wake of a difficult World Cup.

This last week in North America, however, Rooney has shown his new manager Louis van Gaal that he remains hungry, motivated and, most importantly, eminently capable of lifting this United team when he feels the need.

Poor for half an hour here at Sports 
Authority Field on Saturday, Rooney hauled United to victory with two 
stellar contributions towards the end of the first half. Not even a 
second half goal from his own half by Roma substitute Miralem Pjanic 
could upstage him.

A 
terrific Rooney goal – only made possible by perfect technique – from 25
 yards and then an even better pass to Juan Mata helped United in to a 
2-0 lead. Then, after a foul on Danny Welbeck, Rooney drilled the second
 penalty of his tour past the Roma goalkeeper in the 44th minute.

Given
 the heat in Colorado on Saturday, Rooney was taken off at half-time as 
part of an almost total United reshuffle. Roma would only have been glad
 of that.

Certainly it was rather peculiar to see United in front by three at half-time as for half an hour they had been pretty dreadful.

With
 Van Gaal once again using the 3-5-2 formation he has promised will be 
the norm once the Barclays Premier League season starts, United’s 
central defenders were not on the same page at all as Salih Ucan played 
Seydou Keita in behind young Tyler Blackett for a clear run on goal.

The
 Roma midfielder looked as though he had scored as he lobbed the ball 
over young goalkeeper Sam Johnstone but the ball took a huge bounce as 
it landed five yards from the goal line and somehow ended up clearing 
the crossbar.

From range: Pjanic's strike from 60 yards stunned United goalkeeper Ben Amos and the Denver crowd

Spot: Rooney scored his second and United's third from the penalty spot as his side ran riot before the break

Sublime: Mata took the ball down from Rooney and lobbed over Roma goalkeeper Lukasz Skorupski

Relieved not 
to be behind so early, United tried to settle but their midfield kept 
giving the ball away which served only to invite further pressure on 
their uncertain defensive line.

Ucan
 may have done better than shoot at the goalkeeper after Tom Cleverley –
 captain for the day – surrendered possession then Leandro Peredes and 
Akessadro Florenzi came close.

Rooney’s
 first goal was lovely, though, and indicative of just what he can do 
when the mood takes him. Receiving possession 25 yards from goal, the 
28-year-old shifted the ball to his right and whipped an unstoppable 
shot across his own body and in to the goalkeeper’s right hand corner.

It takes two: Rooney is dispossesed by two Roma players in the first-half at Mile High

One
 of the goals of Rooney’s United career, it seemed to inspire him for 
just three minutes later he dropped in to his own half and, spotting 
Mata’s run off a defender’s shoulder, dropped a pass perfectly in to his
 path and watched as the Spaniard took possession and lifted the ball 
over the goalkeeper and in to the goal off the near post.

Roma could have been excused a little disbelief. They had dominated the game but suddenly found themselves two behind.

It
 soon got worse, too, as Danny Welbeck and Ander Herrera exchanged 
passes only for Welbeck to be dragged down as he drove in to the penalty
 area. The contact from Roma’s Mattia Destro may actually have been just
 outside the box but Rooney didn’t care as he stepped up to drill the 
fourth goal of his tour past Lukasz Skorupski from the penalty spot. 

Up and down: Van Gaal was pleased with the win but disappointed with the overall performance

Whipped: Nani, whose future is still unknown at United, attempts a cross-field ball in the second-half

Pressure: Mehdi Benatia closes down United and England striker Danny Welbeck

Mine: Rooney stretches in an attempt to get the ball from Mattia Destro

As
 he had promised, Van Gaal made nine changes at half-time. Only 
Cleverley and Blackett remained. Roma, meanwhile, introduced five new 
players including former Chelsea defender Ashley Cole at left-back.

It
 was, however, a later substitute, the Bosnian midfielder Pjanic, who 
lifted the crowd to their feet with 15 minutes left, beating Ben Amos 
from ten yards inside his own half with a perfect lob that David Beckham
 would have been proud of.

Amos
 was to redeem himself rather with a late save from a Leandor Castan  
overhead kick but Francesco Totti reduced the deficit to one with a late
 penalty after Michael Keane handled in the area.
