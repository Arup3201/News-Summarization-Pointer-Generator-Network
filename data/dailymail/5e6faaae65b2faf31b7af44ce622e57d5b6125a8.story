A boss was hounded at his family home during a bullying campaign by members of  the Unite union over proposed job cuts.

Matthew Ingle had to hire security guards and sought a High Court injunction after protesters allegedly carrying banners, horns and sirens descended on his house in a small village.

They were also accused of bad mouthing the 59-year-old to neighbours near Skipton, North Yorkshire, after his company announced plans to move a transport operation – threatening the jobs of 53 lorry drivers at DHL.

Conflict: Protesters allegedly descended on Matthew Ingle's home as 53 jobs at DHL came under threat

Protesters posted warnings to Mr Ingle on a Facebook page and were said to have indicated that he would have ‘no peace’ until he reconsidered his decision.

One entry read: ‘We came to your town where you do your shopping. We came to your village and spoke to your neighbours.

‘We came to your local pub where you have a drink. We came to your house but you hid behind your large gates...

‘Come back to the table and talk to our Unite reps. We are not going away. We have nothing to lose.’

The allegations follow revelations in the Mail that Unite leader Len McCluskey was using dirty tricks to target executives and their families in Scotland last year

Other online posts accused Mr Ingle of being a ‘coward’ and ‘running scared’.

Unite, Labour’s biggest donor, yesterday refused to condemn the actions and boasted that it was ‘proud’ of having saved some of the jobs.

The revelations come after the Mail revealed how Unite boss Len McCluskey deployed a dirty tricks ‘leverage’ squad to target executives and their families during last year’s dispute at Scotland’s Grangemouth refinery, which was at the heart of the vote-rigging scandal in Falkirk Labour party.

The campaign against Mr Ingle started after his kitchen supply company, Howdens Joinery, announced plans to move a transport operation from Widnes, Cheshire, to Howden, East Yorkshire.

Details of the three protests at Mr Ingle’s home which took place last January and February emerged in court papers after he applied for an injunction to end the ‘harassment to himself and his family and the nuisance and trespass to his property’.

It is believed the injunction was not pursued.

Tory MP Priti Patel condemned the tactics.

She said: ‘Nobody should have to live in fear of union bully boys demonstrating outside their family home.

'But Ed Miliband refuses to condemn this deplorable behaviour in case he upsets his union paymasters.’

A Unite spokesman  said: ‘Unite is proud of having saved our members’ jobs at Howdens Joinery.’

Labour said: ‘We condemn intimidatory tactics from either unions or management in any dispute.’
