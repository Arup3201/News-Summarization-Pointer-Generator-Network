A young date palm named Methuselah has blossomed for the third time after a 2,000-year old seed was planted eight years ago.

The ancient seeds, one of which has produced Methuselah, were discovered in a clay jar at the site of Herod the Great's fortified palace in Masada, Israel in 1973.

While the seeds languished in a drawer of Tel Aviv's Bar-Ilan University for years, one was eventually planted in 2005 and have proved sceptics wrong after producing a seedling - effectively resurrecting a plant last seen in Bibical times.

The only example of a Judean Date Palm located at Kibbutz Ketura, Israel. It was germinated in 2005 from a 2000 year-old seed found in the Masada excavations, and is nicknamed Methuselah. Botanical researcher Elaine Solowey said it looks similar to its modern relatives apart from the length of its third leaf

Botanical researcher Elaine Solowey with help from the Louis L. Borick Natural Medicine Centre at Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, sowed the seed that has now produced the rare and ancient plant.

She told Popular Archaeology: 'When we asked if we could try and grow some of them, they said, "you're mad," but they gave us three seeds.'

'Lotus seeds over 1,000 years old have 
been sprouted, and I realised that no one had done any similar work with
 dates, so why not give it our best shot and we were rewarded.'

The researcher planed the seed as soon as she received it and it blossomed for the first time in 2011.

The ruins of the Mezada are pictured - a geological mesa at the edge of the Judean Desert that rises in 1300 foot cliffs above the level of the Dead Sea. Herod the Great began developing palaces, fortifications, and storehouses on Mezada in 37 BCE and the ancient seeds were found at the site

Masada is an ancient fortification in the Southern District of Israel situated on top of an isolated rock plateau (akin to a mesa) on the eastern edge of the Judaean Desert, overlooking the Dead Sea.

Herod the Great built palaces for himself on the mountain and fortified Masada between 37 and 31 BCE.

The Siege of Masada by troops of the Roman Empire towards the end of the First Jewish–Roman War ended in the mass suicide of the 960 Jewish rebels and their families hiding there.

Masada is located 12 miles east of Arad and is  Israel's most popular paid tourist attraction.

The site of Masada was identified in 1842 and extensively excavated between 1963 and 1965 by an expedition led by Israeli archeologist Yigael Yadin.

Due to the remoteness from human habitation and its arid environment, the site remained largely untouched by humans or nature for two millennia.

While it looks very similar to modern date palms, the tree has some unusual leaves.

Dr Solowey said: 'The only difference between this date 
seedling and any other date seedlings I've seen come up is the length of
 the third leaf. This is very unusual.

She plans on cross-breeding the plant with modern close relatives.

The young date palm has been called Methuselah after a biblical story about the oldest person who ever lived.

The Romans reported seeing groves of the trees in the Jordan River valley, which stretched to the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea, which made the area wealthy.

In ancient literature, the Judean date, which is produced by the palm variety is said to have medicinal properties.

It was used as an aphrodisiac and contraceptive, as well as treatment for toothaches and malaria, as well as cancer.

The ancient Hebrews referred to the palm variety as the 'tree of life' because of the food and shade it produced.
