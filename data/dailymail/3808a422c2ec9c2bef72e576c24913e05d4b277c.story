While many of her colleagues have succumbed to the temptations of Botox and plastic surgery, Cate Blanchett has always been outspoken in her views about ageing gracefully.

Both on screen and on the red carpet, she always radiates with a natural beauty - but while Cate has avoided going under the knife or being jabbed with needles, she still relies on some beauty secrets to keep her looking her best.

The 45-year-old allowed cameras to capture her getting ready for the Academy Awards in February, revealing the $75 'miracle' product that she used to keep her make up fresh throughout the ceremony.

Cate's favourite brand SK-II, for which she has been an ambassador for 11 years, have today released their new product, SK-II Mid-Day Miracle Essence.

The new product is SK-II's cult Facial Treatment Essence product in spray form, which can be used to refresh and revive the skin throughout the day. 

The formula uses Pitera, a yeast strain from Japan rich in vitamins, amino acids, minerals and organic acids, and penetrates beneath the make-up to hydrate the skin whilst the unique moisture-lock complex ensures it stays that way.

Skincare secret: 'Just a few spritz and it instantly revives my skin and keeps my make-up looking fresh with long-lasting moisture throughout the ceremony,' Cate said

The actress was the first to try out the formula at the Oscars. 'Last year at the Academy Awards, I decanted a bottle of Facial Treatment Essence into a spray bottle to keep my make-up fresh and skin hydrated,' she said. 

'This year, SK-II made sure I was well prepared with the launch of my new favourite handbag product, SK-II Mid-Day Miracle Essence with Pitera. 

'Just a few spritz and it instantly revives my skin and keeps my make-up looking fresh with long-lasting moisture throughout the ceremony.'

Cate always exudes elegance and incredible style on the red carpet and her Maison Martin Margiela couture dress tonight does not deviate from her modus operandi.

With a chic chignon, Cate showed off a statement necklace by Tiffany & Company.  Keeping everything very simple really showcased how beautiful Cate is.  We love this kind of style since it's so timeless.

Maison Martin Margiela is now headed by John Galliano, who rose from the fashion ashes like a phoenix with his couture debut.  Cate is supporting John's return by wearing his designs on the red carpet.

Support timeless style with our suggestions below, which we've tweaked for everyday wear. Instead of a full length backless gown, we're feeling the spirit of Margiela in MM6, the youthful diffusion line, short dresses.

SK-II Mid-Day Miracle Essence goes on sale April 1

In a video documenting Cate getting ready for glittering event, the Blue Jasmine star is shown sitting in a robe in her hotel suite bare-faced and surrounded by cosmetics.

Her make-up artist Jeanine Lobell is seen prepping Blanchett's skin, while celebrity hair stylist Renya Xydis styles her hair.  

‘Since Cate's look was going to be a mixture of strong and soft femininity, I wanted her skin to be prepped and highly moisturised for our makeup application,' said Jeanine.  

'I decided to use my tried and true jumpstarter, the SK-II Facial Treatment mask which has all of the amino acids and minerals to hydrate and revitalize the skin. 

'I then decided to indulge her skin with the Facial Treatment Essence, which I love because it not only improves skin clarity but over tonal balance as well. I mean, her complexion glowed!

'We finished up her skincare regimen by sprinkling a little Facial Treatment Essence Eye on my fingers and messaged it around the eye.’ 

SK-II Mid-Day Miracle Essence lands on Australian shelves today, April 1, in Myer and David Jones, and online from Adore Beauty.
