Futuristic planes based on spaceships which could allow passengers to travel from London to Sydney in two and a half hours are being developed.

Virgin Galactic, the space flight company owned by Sir Richard Branson, says that the space tourism plane it is currently developing could be modified and turned into a super jet.

The Concorde-like aircraft would travel outside of the Earth's atmosphere and enter orbit, using gravitational forces to travel at incredibly fast speeds.

Virgin Galactic have so far succeeded in getting the craft outside the stratosphere, the second lowest layer of the atmosphere

Passing above the planet at around 4,200mph it could cover the 10,500 miles from London to Sydney in two and a half hours.

Among the company's other long-term goals are space cruise ships which could take people away from Earth for longer stretches.

Speaking at an event in London yesterday, commercial director Stephen Attenborough said they could serve as orbital hotels, or allow tourists to travel to the Moon and back.

Force India co-owner Michiel Mol and Dutch airline KLM have also teamed up to produce a similar jet which could begin flying next year.

Tickets will initially cost £60,000 but the pair say commercial space flight could be available within 15-20 years.

The company says the first space tourism flight, taken by Richard Branson and his family, will take place next year

Mol's first generation spaceship, the XCOR Aerospace Lynx, will travel at 2,200 mph and he predicts it will be capable of flying four times day and doing 5,000 flights with one engine.

So far Virgin's SS2 aircraft has only managed to exit the stratosphere, the second lowest part of Earth's atmosphere, though the company says it will launch its first flight next year.

Its manned spacecraft became the highest commercial winged vehicle to ever fly and used its shuttlecock-inspired 'feather system' to safely re-entering the Earth's atmosphere.

The company has already collected $80million (£50m) in deposits from 640 wealthy individuals interested in being among the first into space.

The Xerus was the model superseded by the Lynx, a similar aircraft which the Force India boss hopes will provide two-hour London to Sydney trips by 2014

However they will have to queue behind Sir Richard himself as he and his family are due to take the first trip.

The flight took place over the Mojave desert and was piloted by Mark Stucky and Clint Nichols and lasted approximately an hour.

Branson has also launched a TV competition show aimed at rewarding one winner with a ticket on board one of the SS2 craft.

By launching its craft into orbit, 
Virgin Galactic will be able to harness the power of gravity to travel 
at extremely high speeds.

When
 objects enter orbit they are actually falling towards Earth, but the 
fact that they are travelling so fast means they don't re-enter the 
atmosphere.

Craft can reach such high speeds because space is a vacuum, meaning there is no air resistance to slow them down.

The
 Virgin plane would essentially 'surf' along in orbit for a short time 
before using special tail flaps to force itself back down to land.

The
 journey would also be much more environmentally friendly than 
traditional planes as it would only have to power itself along a short 
distance before letting orbit take over.
