The prime minister of Qatar has been revealed as the mystery buyer who spent almost $100 million to purchase New York City’s most expensive penthouse.

Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani brought
the luxurious two-story apartment spread over 10,923 square feet in the 
One57 building back in May.

Furthermore, the billionaire sheikh, who has two wives and 15 children, is reportedly also in discussions about buying four separate, full-floor condos in the exclusive Midtown building, which would bring the total cost to an incredible $250 million.

Loss: The sheik called off a deal to purchase a $100million penthouse in the not-yet-completed One57 building, complete with 10,923 square feet and breathtaking views of the city skyline

The One57 building’s developer, Extell’s 
Gary Barnett, confirmed on May 18 that the apartment had been brought but would 
only say that a ‘very nice family’ had snapped it up.

Mr Barnett said previously that the 
buyer, now known to be Al-Thani, was also looking at buying the Winter Garden unit - a duplex featuring a
 solarium totaling 13,500ft and another floor to create a 20,000 square
 feet space.

If he does make these further purchases that will likely more than double his spending - bringing it up to a staggering $250 million.

Al-Thani laid down between $90million and $100million for the penthouse after his $31.5 million bid for a couple of Fifth Avenue apartments, owned by the late copper heiress Huguette Clark, was rejected.

And he brought the One57 penthouse before he could even see it completed, as the building is currently in development and only due to be finished next year.

The astronomical fee of the penthouse apartment eclipses the 
$88million forked out by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev on a 
penthouse for his daughter last winter at 15 Central Park West.

The One57 building is across the street from Carnegie Hall and a stone’s throw from Central Park.

The penthouse, on the 89th and 90th 
floors, boasts a ‘grand salon’, at least five bedrooms, four fireplaces,
 floor-to-ceiling windows and a large mezzanine, the New York Post 
reported.

As well as staggering views over the Manhattan skyline and beyond, the property also features impressive 23-foot ceilings.

Al-Thani shelled out on the Midtown penthouse after his bid for two Fifth Avenue apartments, owned by the famously reclusive Huguette Clark, was refused.

'He decided to buy the One57 penthouse after the Huguette Clark rejection,' a source told the New York Post.

Despite offering $500,000 over the asking price, the powerful PM’s bid 
was refused with the building’s co-op board even refusing the 
sheikh an interview.

Rejected: Al-Thani initially hoped to buy a couple of Fifth Avenue apartments, owned by the late copper heiress Huguette Clark, for $31.5 million but his bid was rejected by the co-op board

It is thought the board stonewalled his offer after it was revealed he planned to knock the two eight floor apartments into one.

It was also reported that al-Thani's huge family – 
and the entourage of staff who travel with them – also caused concerns 
for the co-op board.

Other reasons cited for the rejection 
were concerns about where his money was coming from and the fact that 
the Sheikh is a foreign head of state with diplomatic immunity.

Situated on 157 West 57th street One57 will become the tallest residential building in the city when it 
is finished next year.
