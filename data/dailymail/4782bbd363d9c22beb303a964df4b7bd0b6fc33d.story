A teenager who was horrified when her father donned a pair of skimpy Dasiy Duke shorts to protest her love of skimpy clothing has said that the incident taught her how much he loved her.

Scott Mackintosh was about to go on a family night out, but when he asked his daughter to change into longer shorts and she refused, he took some scissors to an old pair of his own jeans.

The result was a revealing pair of cut-offs designed to show his daughter her shorts aren't 'as cute as she thinks' - and images of the 52-year-old's fashion choice soon became an internet hit.

'I know it sounds weird to try to embarrass her but I wanted her to know that she's of great worth,' Mr Mackintosh, from Utah, told Good Morning America.

'In our family we have modesty guidelines': Scott Mackintosh's daughter wouldn't change out of her short shorts before a family outing, so the Utah dad slipped into a pair of his own

'It got a point across,' his daughter
 said, smiling. 'Mostly I just learned the lesson of how much he loves 
me and that he really cares about it.'

The images of Mackintosh became a hit after they were shared online.

'In our family we have pretty definite modesty guidelines,' writes Mackintosh on his wife Becky’s blog. 'I'm a firm believer that the way we dress sends messages about us, and it influences the way we and others act.'

He added that the family's motto was 'modest is hottest'.

Every Monday, the family does something together to spend time with the family and last Monday, they decided to go out to eat.

But as they were about to leave, 
Mackintosh’s teen daughter was resolute that she would not change out of
 her Daisy Dukes. So he went to retrieve a pair of jeans and some 
scissors.

At first, the children had their heads buried in their phones, Mackintosh said, and didn’t notice his revealing attire.

'Why are you dressed like that?' his daughter eventually asked when they were nearly at the restaurant. 'Oh well, I don't care.'

Dinner came and went without Mackintosh’s daughter breaking a sweat, so he decided to take things to the next level.

Lesson learned: Scott Mackintosh's daughter Myley said she found out how much her dad loves her

'OK, let’s go miniature golfing,' he said - and again, the daughter wouldn’t let her embarrassment show.

But when they arrived at a local ice cream shop, she cracked.

'As I pulled into a stall, my daughter said, “Uh, no! We are not going in!” I said “Let's go through the drive up".'

Mackintosh, his wife, and their son went inside, but their daughter stayed in the car.

'No
 matter if social media gets the story mixed up and twisted, my daughter
 will always know that her dad loves her and cares about her enough to 
make a fool out of himself,' he wrote.
