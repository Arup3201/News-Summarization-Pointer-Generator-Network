Cooking writer Prue Leith (above) has declared it is time to welcome it back into our kitchens

For years veal has been shunned by restaurants and retailers, cast aside as a cruel and unethical meat.

But cooking writer Prue Leith has declared it is time to welcome it back into our kitchens - and claims it is a vital part of sustainable farming.

‘Thank God,’ she wrote yesterday.

‘Veal chops are my best thing and I want to stop feeling bad about that.’

Miss Leith - author of the bestselling Leith’s Cookery Bible - suggested that using young bulls for meat is a way to sustain organic farms.

‘If we want milk, butter and cream, we need to eat the unproductive bull calves,’ she wrote in her Spectator column.

Veal meat comes from the male calves of cows bred for dairy, slaughtered when they are a few months old.

The meat was rejected by many British consumers in the 1980s, when campaigners revealed they were fed formula milk and kept out of sunlight to keep their meat white and tender.

Since then farmers have instead sold the young calves abroad or shot them at birth.

They cannot be bred for beef, because adult dairy bulls are felt not to make good meat.

But many think that it is time to embrace veal once more.

They say that times have changed since the sight of tiny veal crates turned consumers off the pale meat 30 years ago.

Veal crates were outlawed in the UK in 1990 and British organic farmers now follow strict welfare guidelines.

High-welfare veal - also known as ‘rose’ or ‘pink’ veal - was introduced to the market several years ago, but it has had little success because many still consider all veal to be inhumane.

Miss Leith, 74, argues that veal is a way to keep organic farms going.

‘What cheered me is the news that pasture fed meat is good for you,’ she wrote.

‘Yes, it costs a bit more than that pale, tasteless, tough stuff, but according to recent research it is higher in beneficial fats and antioxidants than factory farmed meat.

‘Besides, if we are ever to give up chemical fertilisers, we’ll need animals to fertilise the land: no animals = more artificial fertiliser.’

Young veal bulls are a byproduct of the dairy industry. To keep a dairy cow producing milk, she has to calve regularly.

If the calf is a female, it is added to the dairy herd. Some male calves are kept as breeding studs, but if they are not used for meat, there is no use for the remainder.

Miss Leith’s intervention last night was met with delight by farmers.

A spokesman for the National Farmers Union said: ‘The NFU fully supports any initiative that increases the value of dairy bull calves to the British dairy farmer.

‘Rearing male calves from the dairy herd for either beef or veal in this country makes a lot more sense than exporting them for someone else to add value to them.’

‘British dairy farmers have long been frustrated by the British consumers’ reluctance to buy welfare-friendly rose-veal so anything that encourages the public to go out and purchase it has to be supported.’

Others insisted that customers can only be sure that British veal is ethical – with imported veal subjected to a far less rigorous standard.

Phil Brooke of Compassion in World Farming said: ‘Calves reared for veal outside Britain are likely to have been exported long distances and reared in barren conditions without bedding. 

‘Welfare in the UK is higher - rearing these male dairy calves for veal in the UK prevents them from being shot at birth as they are unwanted by the dairy industry. We ask anyone who eats veal to choose British.’

Peter Melchett, policy director of the Soil Association organic movement, added: ‘We agree veal is a good solution but we would encourage people to eat pink veal - where the calves have been raised humanly on a natural diet.’

‘If organic farmers can’t use their calves for veal, we encourage them to sell them to someone that can - but they must comply with our transport standard.’

But the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals last night dismissed all veal as unethical.

A Peta spokesman said: ‘Calves are forcibly removed from their mothers when they’re only a few days old.

‘The terrified, lonely babies may be purposely fed a diet low in iron so that they become anaemic and their flesh remains pale.

‘By the time they’re sent to be killed, many of these infants are so weak that they can barely walk up the ramp to the abattoir.’

The best-selling author's intervention has been met with delight by farmers

He added: ‘If Prue Leith wants to stop feeling bad about veal chops, then the logical solution would be to stop consuming dairy products.

‘It is the demand for milk that drives the veal industry.’
