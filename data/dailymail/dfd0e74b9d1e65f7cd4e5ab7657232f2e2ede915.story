Next time your teenagers are having a night in, put Gregory’s Girl in the DVD player.

While they may be horrified at the prospect of watching a movie from way back in 1981, the story of the schoolboy struggling with the agony, ecstasy and downright awkwardness of first love still has something to say to today’s world-weary youngsters.

In fact, according to veteran film critic Barry Norman, Gregory’s Girl is the best teenage movie ever made.

Top 49: The 1981 movie Gregory's Girl, starring Dee Hepburn and John Gordon Sinclair, is the best teenage movie ever made according to veteran film critic Barry Norman

He has included the Scottish romantic comedy in a list of 50 of the best British movies, compiled for the latest edition of Radio Times, alongside classics by Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick and the latest James Bond movie, Skyfall.

Mr Norman said Gregory’s Girl, which was made for a mere £250,000, shows that Britain can produce cinematic gold at a fraction of the cost of Hollywood. Written and directed by Bill Forsyth, it starred John Gordon Sinclair, Clare Grogan and Dee Hepburn, who all received just £50 a day.

Best Bond: 1962 James Bond film Dr. No, starring Sean Connery and Ursula Andress, also made the list which Mr Norman refused to rank in numerical order, saying it was an impossible task

'British cinema is still going strong': The King's Speech, 2010, starring Colin Firth, was nominated as one of 49 films, with Radio Times readers being asked to nominate the 50th

‘Gregory’s Girl is a low-budget classic,’ Mr Norman said. ‘They made it for a quarter of a million quid.

It was quite a while ago now but nevertheless a film made for that little was remarkable in those days. ‘And it is the best study of adolescence I’ve seen in the cinema. 

‘Most American films about  teenagers and school kids and college kids are about sex. Gregory’s Girl is about love, which is much better.’

Mr Norman has chosen 49 films for the list, with Radio Times readers being asked to nominate the 50th. He refused to put his films in numerical order, saying it was an impossible task.

‘Lists always get people worked up,’ 
he said. ‘No doubt this list will be sneered at, and I’m sure I’ve left 
some great films out. But nobody can say with any certainty what the 
best film ever made is as it is entirely subjective. 

‘I
could probably make another list tomorrow with 50 entirely different 
films. But all of these ones had a great plotline, great dialogue, good 
casts, good directors and good back-up crew.

Cult classic: A Clockwork Orange, 1971, starring Malcolm McDowell, along with Barry Lyndon, 1975, were directed by American Stanley Kubrick but Mr Norman counted them as British because they were filmed here

Shortlisted: The Railway Children, 1970, starring Dinah Sheridan, Jenny Agutter and Bernard Cribbins, also made the list of films that had 'a great plotline, great dialogue, good casts, good directors and good back-up crew

'Those are the keys to a good movie. I can’t abide people who say we don’t make them like we used to. Of course we do. British cinema is still going strong.’

One of his choices, the 1953 naval classic The Cruel Sea, had particular sentimental value for him as it was produced by his father Leslie Norman. Two of the films – Barry Lyndon and A Clockwork Orange – were in fact directed by an American, Stanley Kubrick.

But Mr Norman said he counted them as British because they were filmed in the UK and made with a largely British cast.
