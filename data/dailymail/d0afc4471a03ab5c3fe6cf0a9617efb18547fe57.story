Notre Dame football star Manti Te'o kept up the charade that his beloved girlfriend had died even after learning it was a hoax, but claims he did it for the sake of his teammates as they prepared for the national title game, it was revealed today.

Te'o, whose story of losing his love, Lennay Kekua, during the season endeared him to a nation of fans, has said he found out on December 6 that Kekua in fact never even existed back when he received a phone call from 'Kekua.'

But just two days later, he repeated the bogus line that his girlfriend died after battling leukemia to a website in South Bend, Indiana, where the prestigious university is based.

Manti Te'o repeated the lie that his girlfriend died just two days after learning her entire existence was a hoax. He has told friends that he did to protect his teammates who were preparing for the national title.

'I mean, I don’t like cancer at all. I lost both my grandparents and my 
girlfriend to cancer. So I’ve really tried to go to children’s hospitals
and see, you know, children,' the linebacker said to WSBT.com during an interview where he discussed his chances of winning the Heisman Trophy, college football's most honored award.

And on December 11, Te'o told the Daily Press of Newport News, Va., on Dec. 
11 why he played just days after Kekau supposedly died in September.

'She made me promise, when it happened, that I would stay and play,' he said.

Te'o, who is considered a top prospect in this year's NFL draft, didn't tell school officials until December 26.

He has been telling friends that he kept the shocking news to himself because he didn't want to cause a distraction as Notre Dame prepared to take on Alabama for the national championship, TMZ.com said.

During the 20-day gap, Te'o, who has also said in interviews how he met Kekau in person, agonized over what to do before finally coming clean with his coaches, sources told TMZ.

Te'o says he only learned Kekau wasn't real on December 6 when he received a phone call from her cellphone, approximately three months after she died.

In a press conference on Wednesday night, Notre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick said that Te'o was the victim of online predators who took advantage of the athlete's generosity and kindness.

Swarbrick pointed to the documentary film Catfish and an MTV program of the same name in explaining how easy it can be to fool somebody into believing an online relationship is real.

But journalists, including one of the reporters at Deadspin.com that broke the initial story, have called that story into question.

'It takes a great deal of faith if you’re going to believe that Manti Te’o actually spent an entire year with a girlfriend that he never met and that he never had any video chat with,' the Deadspin reporter, Timothy Burke, said on the Today show. 

Burke dug into Te'o's story to discover that his girlfriend never existed. He believes Te'o was in on the ruse, saying, 'it takes a great deal of faith' to think Te'o didn't know the truth.

In numerous published reports, Te'o said that while this past season has brought many triumphs to his life, there were also twin tragedies - the deaths of his 72-year-old grandmother and his girlfriend, Lennay Kekua, within a day of each other.

A comprehensive investigation by Deadspin.com found that while his grandmother did indeed die on September 12, 2012, Kekua did not - nor did she even exist.

The school conducted its own investigation and found that Te'o had been taken for a ride by what Swarbrick calls a sophisticated hoax orchestrated by 'a remarkable number of characters - both male and female.'

He said: 'It was real to Manti. There was no suspicion that it wasn’t. The pain was real, the grief was real, the affection was real - and that's the nature of this sad cruel game.'

'This is incredibly embarrassing to talk about, but over an extended period of time, I developed an emotional relationship with a woman I met online,' Te'o said in a statement.

'We maintained what I thought to be an authentic relationship by communicating frequently online and on the phone, and I grew to care deeply about her.'

Notre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick told the media Wednesday that Te'o was the victim of an elaborate prank perpetrated by others.

However, he stopped short of saying he had ever met her in person or correcting reports that said he had, though he did on numerous occasions talk about how special the relationship was to him.

When she was said to be sick in the hospital, T'e'o would phone her and stay on the line with her as they slept, waking up eight hours later to find her still breathing on the other line.

And it seems the joke is far from over after someone tweeted from Lennay Kekua's Twitter account late last night.

Al Vaosa, who tweets under the username jayRahz, joked about her and even said he was 'running her profile' last December.

He has even said on Twitter that he knew it was all a hoax back in 2008. 

Vaosa claims at that point that he severed all ties with Ronaiah Tuiasosopo, who is the main suspect of being the person behind Lennay Kekua, even though she did not actually exist.

Tuiasosopo, left, is believed to be the main person behind the hoax. Vaosa has claimed he severed ties with him but joked on Twitter last December that he 'was running her profile.'

Among the evidence collected in Notre 
Dame's independent investigation was 'online chatter' that showed some 
people knew about the prank and were 'taking joy in it,' Swarbrick said.

Vaosa, who Tweets under the username Jayrahz, said last month that the story was a hoax.

Vaosa puts the blame on the hoax on Tuiasosopo.

Notre Dame athletic director has said others took pleasure in perpetuating the hoax.

On the night of the BCS title game, one Twitter user, @jayRahz posted: 'I wonder if the real Lennay Kekua is watching the game.. Cause I know the fake one that didn't die is not watching over the Irish!'

But despite the university's claims, there is still substantial doubt that Te'o could have been fooled so easily - and for so long.

'It’s tough for me. I want to believe that Manti Te’o is a smart kid. Playing linebacker for the University of Notre Dame requires a certain amount of smarts, and it would take a pretty, I guess, clueless guy to fall for this for that long. I guess that’s where my skepticism lies,' Burke said.

And Yahoo! sports columnist Dan Wetzel said the case has 'left everyone wondering whether this was really the case of a naïve football player done wrong by friends or a fabrication that has yet to play to its conclusion.'

Gregg Doyel, national columnist for CBSSports.com, was more blunt with assessment.

'Nothing about this story has been comprehensible, or logical, and that extends to what happens next,' he wrote. 'I cannot comprehend Manti Te’o saying anything that could make me believe he was a victim.'
