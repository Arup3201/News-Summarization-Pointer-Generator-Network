Shocking video shows the moment a 22-year-old American blew himself up in a suicide bombing last week in Syria.

College drop out Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha, originally from Florida, is believed to be the first U.S. citizen to kill himself in a Syrian terrorist attack, the State Department said Friday.

The bombing was organized by an affiliate of al-Qaeda, and the group uploaded a video to YouTube of one of the four bombings that took place on May 25.

In the video, men are seen loading a truck full of explosives, before driving off and detonating in a Syrian military compound.

Abu-Salha, who was named in postings to social media websites under the alias 'Abu Haraya Al-Amriki', reportedly 
arrived in Syria late last year, where he joined militants in the area.

Abu-Salha is believed to be involved with carrying out a rash of attacks in Syria's Idlib province. The attacks were carried out on behalf of Jabhat al-Nusra, an Al Qaeda affiliate attempting to oust the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad. 

Abu-Salha is believed to be the first American to commit a suicide bombing in Syria on behalf of Al Qaeda. 

In a video 
posted on YouTube by the propaganda wing of the militant group, 
participants were shown loading explosive material into a large truck. 
The truck is then driven to a building, where a massive explosion is 
caught on camera.

The terror plot was organized by group Jabhat al-Nusra, an affiliate of al-Qaeda. They released a video of attack, starting with men loading a truck full of explosives

The truck drives down the road toward a military center, presumably with abu-Salha inside. The group organized four separate attacks on May 25

The military center appears peaceful just before the blast

It's unclear how many were killed in the explosion

Abu-Salha is believed to be the first American suicide bomber in Syria

According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, who spoke to Agence France-Presse,
 the attacks were meant to cut off roadways in Idlib before the June 3 
presidential elections. The area connects to another area believed to 
the 'heartland' for support of President Assad.

The New York Times reports that a Moner Abu-Salha, who's Facebook profile picture was reportedly the same face as the picture tweeted by a cleric allied with Jabhat al-Nusra, showed that he was a Floridian that held a keen interest in Islamic topics (The profile could not be found at this time.)

In a check of public records performed by New York Times reporters, Moner Abu-Salha had previously lived in Fort Pierce and Vero Beach, Florida. Both areas are approximately 100 miles north of Miami.

Moner Abu-Salha attended Sebastian River High School and played on the Indian River Warriors youth basketball team in 2007.

He went on to study at Seminole State College of Florida before dropping out. The college confirmed that he was enrolled in the school in August 2011 but never graduated.

A family friend who wished not to be identified told WPTV that Moner Abu-Salha left the country unexpectedly last year and had been telling his family that he was living in Jordan and working as a nurse.

Neighbors of the family in Florida say his mother Michelle dressed conservatively with a Hijab covering hair.

Neighbor Bill Miller told the Washington Post that Moner Abusalha once got suspended from school for fighting with boys who made fun of his mother's clothing.

Another neighbor, Cynthia Heinz, says the family faced financial issues and moved twice in their old neighborhood when they lost their first home due to foreclosure a few years ago,

Since the beginning of the Syrian civil war, approximately 100 Americans have traveled to Syria, to fight with one of the numerous anti-Assad groups.
