Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone was happy with his team's workmanlike performance against Juventus in Turin.

Simeone's side played out a 0-0 draw with the Italians knowing that they had already qualified for the last 16 of the Champions League.

Atletico only needed a point from their trip to Turin to top Group A and their Argentinian manager was satisfied with the display.

'We played the game we needed to play in order to finish top,' Simeone told Sky Sport Italia.

'It was a very tight first half with two important scoring opportunities and Juve created a few dangers down the right.

'After the break we did what we had to do.

'We expected it to be tough, as Juve are a strong side with many champions and can certainly go forward.

'We are happy, as for the second year running, we topped our group, and for Atletico Madrid, that means a lot in the Champions League.

'We calmly await what destiny brings us in the next phase.'

The Juventus home crowd created a raucous atmosphere for their side, who did enough to qualify

A Juventus victory by two goals or more would have seen the Old Lady leapfrog Atletico into top spot.

But a draw was more than enough for Massimiliano Allegri's side who also progress to the knockout stages and Simeone admitted that no team will look forward to facing the Serie A giants in the next phase.

'Juventus are an excellent side, with [Claudio] Marchisio out and some lads on the bench who are very talented,' he added.

'I can assure everyone it won't be good to pick Juventus in the draw.'
