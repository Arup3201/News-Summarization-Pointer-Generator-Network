A trippy new yoga class is encouraging students to smoke marijuana before starting their practice.

Dee Dussault, 34, began teaching weekly Ganja Yoga group classes at San Francisco's Merchants of Reality studio in October. Each class is 75 minutes long and costs $15.

'A lot of students are consuming it before yoga anyway,' she told ABC News. 'So a big benefit that I am hearing is the community aspect. The first thing they want to do after consuming cannabis is lay down and stretch. And, depending upon the dosage and strain, it really encourages people to relax.'

Students are asked to smoke cannabis on their own prior to arrival - but those with a medical marijuana card can get high with their fellow yogis during a 15-minute pre-class session at which attendees introduce themselves while sitting in a circle.

Ms Dussault, who has practiced yoga for 20 years and previously taught the ganja variety in Toronto starting in 2009, says that the idea of pairing pot with yoga has ancient roots.

'Historically, cannabis has been linked to really early use with yoga in ancient Shiva cults. Back then, they weren't smoking it, but drinking it in a milk beverage and burning it as an incense,' she said.

Her class, which is usually attended by 16 students on Wednesday evenings, has proved so popular that she's looking into adding additional times.

'I get as many people who are hard-core yoga practitioners but new to cannabis as I do cannabis consumers who are new to yoga,' she told MailOnline. 

'I also get a number of people who regularly use both, but not necessarily together. And some are regular practitioners of cannabis-enhanced yoga and are glad to have a place to go. So, it's a variety of previous experience levels and motivations.'

While the class attracts equal numbers of male and female practitioners, Ms Dussault notes that 'far more men' attend Ganja Yoga than her other yoga classes.

However, experts warn that it might be dangerous to engage in athletic activity while high on a controlled substance - according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, marijuana raises your heart rate by 20-100per cent and the effect can last up to three hours.

But Ms Dussault insists that her moves are slow and gentle.

'We do not do any postures that are not suited to altered states of conscious - it's very sweet and very, very safe,' she writes on her website, adding that singles, couples and groups of friends frequently book her for private sessions.

Ms Dussault also offers private instruction in Clothing-Free Yoga and Sexual Awakening Yoga. 

'Cannabis, if the strain and dose are correct for the individual, promotes relaxation. Yoga obviously cultivates relaxation. So, the two together are greater than the sum of the parts,' she said. 

'Cannabis can help to decrease brain activity that is required for production and consumption - which of course we are conditioned to constantly be doing. It takes people to a place in which they are more open to relaxing tensions in the body and mind. It makes them want to chill out, have a good time, enjoy life.'

Ms Dussault isn't the first to bring pot yoga to the West Coast; yogi Liz McDonald has been teaching 4:20 Yoga at Los Angeles studio Atwater Yoga since 2010.
