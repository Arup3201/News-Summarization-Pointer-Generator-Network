It was a stylish yet sombre affair at St. George's Church in London this afternoon as fashion's most powerful figures celebrated the life of the late Beatrix Miller.

Beatrix, who passed away aged 90 in February, was editor of British Vogue between 1964-1986.

Today's guests included American Vogue editor Anna Wintour, current British Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman, supermodel Twiggy, designer Jasper Conran and Bianca Jagger.

Other attendees included legendary photographers Terry O'Neill and Mario Testino.

Miss Miller, as she was known to her employees, was born on in 1923 and began her journalistic career at The Queen, a British society magazine, where she started out as a secretary and worked her way up features editor.

She relocated to New York in 1956, and joined Vogue as a copywriter.

Later, in 1958, she returned to The Queen as editor - revamping it and transforming it into a glossy magazine aimed at young women, rather than the older socialites who had previously made up the readership.

She landed the role of editor of British Vogue in 1964, where she worked tirelessly. The proof was in her final issue of the magazine; the largest ever at 470 pages.

Miss Miller never married and her employees said she dedicated her life to Vogue.

She retired in 1984 and joined forces with Terence Conran and Jean Muir to establish a think tank, which linked the government and fashion industry.

She died on 21 February 2014.

Opera director Patrick Kinmonth wrote for Vogue in her memory: 'Her permanent influence hangs over all of us like the smoke from her cigarettes: a strange and fascinating cocktail of intimidating school matron, hyper-dignified spinster, brilliant and imaginative headmistress, all electrified by a low threshold of boredom, a genuinely acute literary mind, and an almost total lack of interest and confidence in her own appearance.

'But when she laughed her rare, shy, intimate, genuine laugh, she could be utterly captivating, even if her hair gave her grief and she had no interest in personally dressing the part of Vogue.'

Current Vogue editor, Alexandra Shulman, added: 'I often look back at her Vogues for inspiration and of course because, like myself, her career was rooted in journalism not fashion.

'I find the most wonderful articles alongside the fashion images, so many of which are now so famous. She saw Vogue as a chronicler of a particular world and she did a wonderful job.'

Finding fame: Her journalistic coup came when she landed the role of editor of British Vogue in 1964, where she worked tirelessly. The proof was in her final issue of the magazine; the largest ever at 470 pages
