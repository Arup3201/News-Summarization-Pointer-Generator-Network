A man accused of murdering Stephen Lawrence today apologised to a jury after a police tape of his racist tirade was played to the court.

David Norris told the Old Bailey he was 'ashamed' of comments he made in 1994 when he said he would torture black people.

He said: 'I apologise for what you've had to listen to in the courtroom.'

David Norris gives evidence to the Old Bailey today in the Stephen Lawrence murder trial. He said he was 'certainly not' involved in the killing

Extracts of surveillance footage shot at co-defendant Gary Dobson's flat in Eltham, south-east London, were played to the jury for a second time today.

In one of the clips, Norris is heard 
saying: 'If I was going to kill myself do you know what I would do? I 
would go and kill every black c***, every Paki, every copper, every mug 
that I know, I'm telling you.'

Later
he said: 'I would go down Catford and places like that, I am telling 
you now, with two sub machine guns, and I am telling you I would take 
one of them, skin the black c*** alive mate, torture him, set him 
alight... I would blow their two arms and legs off and say "go on, you 
can swim home now". They would be bobbing around like that.'

David Norris' mother was today accused of giving a false alibi for her son.

Prosecutor Mark Ellison QC told the Stephen Lawrence murder trial that Theresa Norris invented the story that her son was at home when the black teenager was murdered in April 1993.

He told her: 'The first that we've heard of any suggestion that you can alibi your son for this murder is today. I suggest to you that as a result of that you have made it up and it's a recent thing that you have made it up.'

Mrs Norris said: 'I haven't made nothing up.'

Mr Ellison said: 'There's not been a breath uttered until today that you were in a position to give your son an alibi.'

She answered: 'My son would have been at home.'

Today Norris, 35, told the jury that he was angry after being accused of Mr Lawrence's murder and would never stage such an attack.

'I wouldn't dream of doing something like that, I was just angry, I was suffering from all sorts of stuff,' he said.

Norris went on: 'I got accused of a murder, a terrible murder, and I was angry, especially with the police force... I'm not saying I'm perfect, I'm far from perfect, but to accuse me of murder. I was angry, very angry.'

Before the clip was shown, he said: 'I don't like to watch it to be honest with you, I'm ashamed.'

Norris told the court that people would swear at him and threaten him after he was accused of the killing.

He said: 'I had to see my mum cry herself to sleep every night and it broke my heart.'

Later he added: 'I was not party to Stephen Lawrence's death.

'I played no part whatsoever in his death. I'm not an angel, never have been an angel, but I'm also not a murderer.'

The surveillance footage also showed Norris recounting a fight when he called a black man 'a black c***' and a f****** c**n'.

The man had come to intervene in a brawl that Norris was having in a park.

David Norris, right, today apologised to the jury after a tape of his racist tirade was played to the court. Both Norris and Gary Dobson, left, deny murder

Today Norris said: 'I thought he was 
getting involved so I punched him... He basically came to help me which 
made me feel terrible... I believe I called him a racist word.'

But he denied being racially prejudiced at the time despite using racist obscenities.

Stephen
Batten QC, for Norris, asked him: 'It's not just using language Mr 
Norris, it's holding views. Did you as a boy aged 16 not just use 
impolite language about black people but were you prejudiced against 
them?'

Norris replied: 'No I would say I was not, I just said words and didn't really know what I was saying.'

Murdered: Stephen Lawrence, 18, who was stabbed to death at a bus stop in Eltham, south-east London, in April 1993

The court heard Norris, who was 16 at the
time, was living with his mother in Chislehurst, and 
had ‘given up on school’.

He added that at the age of 16, his 
mother would not have allowed him to be away from his home in 
Chislehurst, Kent, on a weekday night.

Another clip showed his friend Neil Acourt hiding a large knife in his trousers before the pair went out.

Norris said this was unremarkable at 
the time, and that Mr Acourt had told him he went out armed because 'he 
was worried about attacks'.

The
defendant, who was 16 at the time of the murder, also told the jury 
that a sweatshirt and jeans upon which forensic evidence was found did 
not belong to him.

The jury was shown pictures of his brother wearing the clothes while out fishing.

Norris said he could not explain how 
fibres got there. He said the clothing was not his and he had only moved
to the room a week before.

Asked if there could be an innocent explanation, he said: 'If I don't 
know who killed that Stephen Lawrence, then I don't know if I bumped 
into them.'

Pressed on whether it could have been one of his friends, he replied: 'I don't 
know. They told me they had nothing to do with it and I believe them.'

The defence has suggested that the clothes could have been contaminated after they were seized by police.

Asked later about whether he had a girlfriend named Cheryl in Eltham at the time, Norris said he did not recognise the name.

But Mr Ellison asked him to look at a transcript of a 1999 television interview he did with Martin Bashir.

He asked him if he had agreed that it was 50-50 whether he was in Eltham on the night. He said: 'No, sir.'

Norris said he had never been able to remember what he was doing on the night, but he had not attacked Mr Lawrence.

He added: 'I had no girlfriend by the name of Cheryl that I can remember.'

Mr Ellison read from the transcript: 
'Interviewer "On the day in question, as best you can remember, it is 
most likely you spent some of the day in Eltham?"

'Answer: "Yes." Interviewer: "So you may have been in Eltham with your girlfriend that night?"

'Answer: "50%, yeah".'

Mr Ellison asked: 'Making things up for TV?' Norris replied: 'I don't remember saying it.

Norris and Dobson, 36, both deny murdering the black A-level student at a bus stop in Eltham in April 1993.

The case continues.
