Attack: Jeanne Marie Ryan, 29, suffered a broken nose and fractured cheek bone after being attacked in a club when she confronted a man who tried to grope her

An Oxford University student who posted a battered and bruised 'selfie' after a nightclub attack to make a stand against violence has raised more than £12,000.

Jeanne Marie Ryan posted the graphic photo of her purple and blue, swollen face online after being beaten in a nightclub.

The 29-year-old said she confronted a man who groped her on the dancefloor and was punched in the face up to seven times.

She suffered a broken nose and fractured cheek bone.

As the 'no make-up selfie' mania began to sweep social media to raise money for Cancer Research UK, the student decided to make her own stand.

And in just one week, she has surpassed her £100 target, raising more than £12,000 for a rape crisis centre in Oxford from over 1,400 donations - and the amount has been rising every minute.

The DPhil student, reading Education at St Edmund Hall, said: 'I was really, really mad. I thought I just needed to do something about this.

'I wanted to help women who go through this sort of thing. I get very angry with guys like this.

'I'm just incredibly impressed. It has just made me feel a lot better that something good can come out of this. I wasn't expecting this at all.'

On her Just Giving page, she added: 'I am sorry cancer research, but my #nomakeupselfie is for a different cause.

'I'm trying to channel my rage into something constructive, so I'm raising money for the Oxford Sexual Abuse and Rape Crisis Centre.'

Women around the world posted images online of them without make-up in support of Cancer Research

Viral: Miss Ryan's attacked selfie emerged as no make-up selfies swept social media last week, with celebrities such as Cheryl Cole joining in and making donations to the charity

Recalling the attack she said she was groped by a man as she danced at Plush Lounge in Park End Street, Oxford.

The attacker then reigned down seven blows leaving her bloodied and bruised.

'He was expecting me to back down and cry and when I didn't, he just got more and more angry,' said Miss Ryan recalling the attack.

The student was then punched outside the club, causing her to trip down some steps.

A variation on the trend saw men taking pictures of themselves wearing make-up

'I was hoping that someone would pull him off me. But when I stood back up, he hit me another four or five times,' she said.

A spokesman from Oxford Sexual Abuse and Rape Crisis Centre said they work with more than 350 women and girls, and their families, each year who have been sexually assaulted.

'We're overwhelmed by the response to the campaign and would like to give huge thanks to Jeanne Marie for sharing her experience in such a brave way,' said the spokesman.
