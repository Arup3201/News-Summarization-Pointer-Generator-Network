Movie theaters in Idaho have reportedly been banned from serving alcohol during showings of the erotic R-rated blockbuster Fifty Shades of Grey.

According to the Idaho Statesman, state law prohibits the sale of booze when it comes to 'sexually explicit films.'

Apparently at least two theaters have been ordered to comply with the restrictions - leaving many moviegoers up in arms.

Indeed, Michele Williams, 50, of Eagle told the newspaper: 'I just found it odd that this movie was singled out. 

'I just thought, "What year am I living in here? Women can't control themselves when they drink during this movie?" I don't know what the message was.'

Meanwhile, Michael Deeds who reported the ban for the Idaho Statesman, said it's just another example of 'nonsensical' regulation.

'Here's an equally polite if totally exasperated message right back at state lawmakers: Idaho's prudish, remarkably bad alcohol statute needs to be tied up, blindfolded and dominated by someone with a brain,' he wrote.

Dave Corkill, a theater owner in Idaho, agrees that the law is flawed.

He noted that some PG-13 films seemingly violate the statute as it calls out actions such as 'hugging' and 'caressing another person in the wrong manner.'

Corkill hopes by highlighting the issue lawmakers will change the Idaho Code 23-614.

He adds that for many customers sitting down in front of a movie with a bottle of wine is 'part of the experience.'
