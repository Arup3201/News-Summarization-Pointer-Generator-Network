A killer who stabbed his partner and six-year-old son to death said money did not ‘mean anything’ to him and that ‘happiness is the main thing in life’ as he launched a legal battle to inherit his victims’ estate.

The family of Lisa Clay said they were ‘very distressed’ by Paul Chadwick’s claims as he attempted to use a legal loophole usually reserved for victims of domestic violence in a High Court bid for her £80,000 assets.

Chadwick, 35, knifed 40-year-old Miss Clay and their son Joseph dozens of times at their family home in April last year.

Paranoid schizophrenic Paul Chadwick has launched a bid to inherit the £80,000 assets of his partner Lisa Clay, who he stabbed to death - along with their six-year-old son - at their family home in April last year

The paranoid schizophrenic was jailed indefinitely in a secure mental health unit after pleading guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

By law, Chadwick is entitled to half the couple’s £120,000 semi-detached house in Bolton-le-Sands, Lancashire, which was largely bought with money Miss Clay inherited on her mother’s death in 2012.

But he is battling to obtain Miss Clay’s half and other assets including a joint saving account and her pension fund. Her family have described his action as a ‘torment’ for them.

Yesterday Chadwick gave evidence at Manchester Civil Justice Centre after being granted permission to leave the Guild Lodge unit near Preston.

Wearing a crumpled red and white striped shirt and short blue tie, he said: ‘It is not about benefiting. It is just obviously I have been portrayed in the papers that this is to do with money.

‘I was unwell. I nearly took my own life. I have got about 20 injuries to myself and stuff.

‘This is to put to the courtroom that I was very unwell at the time. I have been through the worst that I could ever imagine. It can’t get any worse than I already have.

‘I have lost more than any money that can be given to me. I have lost more than that. I have not benefited in any way. I have lost Lisa and I have lost my son Joseph. Money cannot take away from that.

‘Money does not mean anything in life, happiness is the main thing in life.’

Asked about his statement to police in which he admitted the stabbings, he added: ‘I would never have taken the steps at all. It was not my hands. It was not me at all. At the time it was not my actions.

‘It was not me, that is all I can say. It was a place where I wouldn’t even wish it on my worst enemy.

‘I loved them to bits and whatever happens I have got memories of them no one can take that away from me, nobody.’

He later broke down in the witness box when asked about the injuries he inflicted on his son, which he insisted he had no memory of.

Representing Miss Clay’s family, David Gilchrist accused Chadwick of using the hearing to put ‘his version of events’ into the public domain.

He said: ‘It appeared from his evidence that he regarded these proceedings as a vehicle for him to put his side of the version of events.

‘The fact that he has brought this application for those reason in my submission counts against the jurisdiction being exercised in his favour.’

Miss Clay’s aunt Greta Squires described the killings as ‘brutal’ and pointed out that Chadwick will still benefit from the sale of the house. She said: ‘This has added to our distress.’

Before the hearing Chadwick made a bid to hold the proceedings in private.

Representing him, Michael Whyatt, told Judge Mark Pelling QC: ‘He is concerned he has been portrayed as some sort of money-orientated individual who is callously in pursuit of funds to which he has no rightful claim.’

He said his client ‘wanted to get something back in terms of recognition’ that his actions did not reflect his character.

Judge Pelling said the default position was of open justice, and it was ‘in everybody’s interests’ that the case was heard in public.

The court heard how Chadwick had been acting ‘strangely’ and appeared ‘paranoid’ in the week before the killings in 2013.

He stabbed his partner of 11 years 32 times and his son 25 times on April 9, before turning a knife on himself and falling down the stairs in a botched suicide attempt.

A pathologist’s report revealed both victims showed signs they had defended themselves and had smaller wounds that showed Chadwick had ‘prodded’ them with a knife while they were alive.

His mother Susan called police after seeing Miss Clay’s body through the letterbox when she visited the house because the family had failed to meet her as planned.

She told the hearing: ‘I was shouting all their names and there wasn’t a sound in the house at all. I was on the phone to the emergency services, the next thing I saw was Paul with a very white face falling down the stairs.’

After giving evidence, Mrs Chadwick, who wept during her son’s testimony, said: ‘Can I just mention that they were very loved and they all loved each other. She was like a daughter to me Lisa.’

The law states those convicted of murder or manslaughter cannot inherit from their victims or profit in any way from their crimes.

But under the Forfeiture Act of 1982, there is clause allowing this to be ‘modified’ due to exceptional circumstances in the conduct of the offender or deceased.

For example, if a battered wife who has suffered years of violence at the hands of her husband suddenly retaliates, accidentally killing him, she may still be able to inherit his estate.
