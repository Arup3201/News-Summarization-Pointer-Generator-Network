Two fraudsters who ripped off an estimated 16,000 music lovers by selling gig tickets which never existed have been jailed for a total of eight years.

Gary Agar, 44, and his brother-in-law Andrew Lagan, 49, duped fans of acts including Kings of Leon, Jay-Z and Sir Paul McCartney into buying fake tickets tickets online.

The £2.65million scam targeted big events all over the country and Europe such as T in the Park festival in Balado, Kinnross-shire, Scotland, the V Festivals, in Staffordshire and Essex, and the Benicassim festival in Spain.

Sentencing the two men at Harrow Crown Court today Judge Martyn Barklem said: 'It was a nasty and greedy fraud aimed at duping large numbers of people, mostly young people who bought tickets in good faith.'

But he added that he accepted neither Agar nor Lagan were the 'mastermind' behind the conspiracy and that the evidence suggested a criminal based in Hungary had approached them and set up fraudulent websites.

The judge added: 'You were instrumental in transferring away the large sums of money that were received.'

'I am satisfied that neither of you received the lion's share of the proceeds of this fraud.'

The fake tickets were for the biggest events up and down the country and across Europe for acts such as Kings of Leon (pictured)

The conmen sold the tickets through their company Good Time Entertainments between November 2009 and October 2010.

Prosecutor Toby Fitzgerald said: 'Having had the money transferred into a bank account controlled by the defendants the money was removed from the bank account.

'It was removed to make very sure that when the inevitable time of reckoning came, when it became clear that the tickets were not provided and people were after their money back, the money had disappeared,' he added.

Some of the transfers were made to Link FX money exchange in Victoria, central London, where more than £1.5m in cash was withdrawn.

The rest was split up between an account in Hungary and an account held in Thailand - where Agar would regularly visit.

When customers did not receive their tickets, they contacted their credit or debit card issuers, who in turn contacted First Data International (FDI), who handled the purchases.

First Data International had provided Good Time Entertainments with a 'merchant terminal' through which they would take payment for the bogus tickets.

Lagan and Agar had agreed a deal with the Hungarian company, allowing them to use their merchant terminal in return for a commission.

Many music fans were never reimbursed and only £1.9m was returned via charge backs for the offences.

Lagan, of North Ormesby, Middlesbrough, and Agar, of South Ruislip, west London, were both convicted of 
two counts of conspiracy to defraud and one count of converting or 
transferring criminal property after a two week trial at Harrow Crown 
Court.

A third defendant, David Rolls, 48, was 
cleared of all charges after insisting he had no knowledge of the scam 
and merely operated as a courier for Lagan and Agar.
