Pope Francis is assembling a panel of experts to advise him on sex abuse in the clergy, the archbishop of Boston said today.

The panel will look at how to protect children from paedophiles, how to better screen men for the priesthood and how to help victims who have already been harmed.

The creation of the panel was announced today following a meeting between the Pope and his cardinal advisors and will tackle the sexual abuse scandals that have rocked the Catholic Church in recent years.

Beacon of hope: Pope Francis is setting up an expert committee to investigate how to tackle sex abuse within the Catholic Church

Boston was the epicentre of the 2002 clerical sexual abuse scandal in the US and poignantly it was its archbishop, Cardinal Sean O’Malley, who announced the creation of the commission.

The commission will be made up of international lay and religious experts on sex abuse, and is set to study current programs to protect children, better screen priests and to train church personnel, Cardinal O'Malley said.

The findings will be used to suggest new initiatives for both the Holy See to implement inside the Vatican City State and for bishops to implement around the world, he added.

To date, the Vatican’s involvement in the sex abuse crisis has been largely judicial in nature, with the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in 2001 taking over church trials for priests accused of raping and molesting children.

New ground: The commission, announced by Boston's archbisop Cardinal Sean O'Malley,  will be made up of international lay and religious experts on sex abuse, and is set to look at how to protect children from paedophiles, how to better screen men for the priesthood and how to help victims

Bringing change: Pope Francis, seen among an adoring crowd on Wednesday's Papal Audience in the Vatican, has been praised around the world for modernising the attitude of the Catholic Church

However, Cardinal O'Malley said he did not know whether one of the issue of how to hold bishops who shelter abusive priests 
accountable would be studied by the commission.

Advocates for victims of clerical abuse have long denounced the Vatican’s refusal to sanction bishops who shielded abusive priests and moved them from parish to parish rather than report them to police.

‘Quite frankly that’s something that the church needs to address,’ O’Malley said. ‘I’m not sure whether it will be this commission or the CDF (Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith) or the Congregation for Bishops.’

The commission was announced just days after the Vatican submitted its responses to a U.N. committee monitoring its implementation of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child.

The Vatican dodged many of the committee’s questions about sex abuse by arguing that it is up to bishops and dioceses to implement programs to protect children, not the Holy See.
