If he wasn't regretting his 'selfie' at Nelson Mandela's memorial service this week, Barack Obama probably would be after Saturday Night Live's latest dig.

Last night's installment mocked the U.S. leader's hand-held group portrait with Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt and British Prime Minister David Cameron.

Obama (played by Jay Pharoah) also defended his controversial handshake with Cuban President Raul Castro at the memorial, saying the Cuban leader told him he was a Mexican actor.

SNL's cold open: As President Barack Obama (Jay Pharoah) discussed progress on his ObamaCare website, the faux sign language interpreter from the Nelson Mandela memorial (Kenan Thompson) gestured behind him

Not thrilled: When 'Obama' says, 'I can't say I've been entirely thrilled...', the fake translator pulls out popular dance move from Michael Jackson's Thriller video clip

The skit played out on televisions across America as Mandela's funeral took place in South Africa.

During the cold open, the fake sign language interpreter, Thamsanqa Jantjie, from Mandela's memorial also got the SNL treatment.

As Obama provided an ObamaCare website update, the 'schizophrenic' interpreter (played by Kenan Thompson) stood behind him to 'translate'.

When Obama said, 'I have been listening', the interpreter held his hand to his ears.

The interpreter broke into dance moves from Michael Jackson's Thriller video clip when Obama said, 'While I can't say I've been entirely thrilled with the results...'.

He also tweaked his nipples when Obama stated, 'I'm just relieved the website has been turned on again.'

After the unhinged translator was seized by Secret Service personnel, a jealous German Chancellor Angela Merkel (played by Kate McKinnon) swooped in to demand two selfies with the President.

'I have und favor to ask. Ze Danish Prime Minister has been bragging all over Northern Europe about her selfie with you and I vas hoping I could get one as well,' she said in a faux German accent, pulling a camera from her pocket.

When Obama declined, Merkel guilt tripped him.

'Oh really? I think you kind of owe me after the whole phone-tapping mein cellphone thing.'

Fortunately for Obama, he managed to avoid another awkward handshake with Raul Castro.

'I felt like Lemony Snicket, because I experienced a series of unfortunate events,' he said. 'I got caught shaking hands with Raul Castro. In my defense, he told me he was Edward James Olmos.'

Meanwhile, Santa Claus appeared on the sketch show's Weekend Update, poking fun at Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's bizarre 'Santa is white' remark.

Kenan Thompson's Santa assured viewers that he is 'black as hell' and explained how the impression that he is white helps get Christmas night deliveries done faster.

'A white guy taking credit for something a black guy did? I’m more used to it than okay with it,' he said.

'History always gets whitewashed. I bet you never knew there was a rewritten version of The Night Before Christmas. Let me read you the original.

'His eyes, how they twinkled, his dimples, they amazed, and when I saw him I exclaimed, ''Damn is that Isaac Hayes?'' '
