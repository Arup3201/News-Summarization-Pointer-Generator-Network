The impartiality of the Speaker of the House of Representatives has been called into question after Bronwyn Bishop was accused of hosting Liberal Party fundraisers in her Parliament House Speaker's suite, in Canberra.

Mrs Bishop, who has been a member of the Liberal Party since the age of 17, has reportedly been taking advantage of the plush room to host functions, while Labor office holders say they never used the room in such a way.

However, a spokesman for the Australian politician claimed there was nothing illegal about the practice and reassured taxpayers that the government is not coughing up the bill for any soirees.

Under fire: Bronwyn Bishop has been accused of hosting Liberal Party fundraisers in her Parliament House Speaker's suite in Canberra

'From time to time the Speaker holds private functions in Parliament House as does a large number of members and senators... the cost is charged to her private account,' they told the Sydney Morning Herald.

Mrs Bishop, 71, reportedly hosted a Liberal Party fundraising event in her suite on the night of the May 13 budget.

The Sunday Telegraph claims the dinner was attended by 20 Liberal donors and cost $50,000.

Diners were reportedly charged $2,500 a plate and Prime Minister Tony Abbott is also thought to have attended the party.

Labor says if the claim is proven, Mrs Bishop should stand down.

'If this is true, her position as Speaker is no longer tenable,' manager of opposition business Tony Burke told AAP in a statement.

The Speaker's office was meant to be owned by the parliament.

'It's not a venue for hire,' Mr Burke said.

But a spokesman for Mrs Bishop said she had not broken any electoral laws by holding the fundraising dinner.

'The Speaker does from time to time have private functions at parliament, as do many other members and senators,' the spokesman told News Corp.

Labor has previously questioned Mrs Bishop's 'serious partiality' in her question time rulings, unsuccessfully moving a motion of no confidence in her in March.

Recent Labor Speakers Anna Burke and Harry Jenkins said they had never used their Parliament House office for party fundraising events.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott nominated Mrs Bishop as the next Speaker last year and she was elected on 12 November 2013.

She is the third female Speaker of the House of Representatives.
