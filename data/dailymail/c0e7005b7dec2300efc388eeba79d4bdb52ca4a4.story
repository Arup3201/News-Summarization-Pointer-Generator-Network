Ryan O'Neal's troubled son Redmond has been arrested and denied bail after police allegedly found a stash of heroin in his car.

Police say 26-year-old Redmond, the son of the late Farrah Fawcett, was pulled over in Santa Monica yesterday morning after he ran a red light.

He is currently being held in custody on no bail, but is yet to be charged, website RadarOnline.com reports.

Officers are said to have found a quantity of heroin in his car when they inspected his vehicle.

A police spokesman told the website: 'At approximately 8.45am a motor officer observed an argument at a store on Lincoln corner of Michigan.

'O'Neal was one of those involved in the argument.

'The officer then watched as he got into his vehicle. He proceeded to go north bound on Lincoln before turning west bound on Olympic, it was at this time the officer observed him going through the red turn arrow.'

The spokesman added that the officer stopped Redmond for the traffic violation before discovering the narcotics.

His arrest came just hours before his half-brother Griffin O'Neal was hospitalised after a car accident.

The 46-year-old was driving in Escondido, San Diego County when he collided with another vehicle.

He was taken to a nearby hospitalised, but later discharged.

Redmond's arrest comes less than a year after the redhead finished a court-ordered drug treatment programme.

O'Neal is still on probation from a 2009 incident which saw him bring drugs onto the grounds of a jail.

He was in incarceration during his mother's final months for a probation violation stemming from drug charges.

He was briefly released to pay her a visit on her deathbed and attend her funeral following her June 2009 death.

On the first anniversary of her passing, his father Ryan said his son was clean.

He said at the time: 'His mother would be proud of him.'
