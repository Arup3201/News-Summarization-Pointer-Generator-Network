Chanel has come under fire for showing Native American-inspired headdresses as part of its latest collection presented in Dallas on Tuesday.

Activist Sasha Houston Brown was dismayed to see models were dressed in feathered headpieces walking down the runway at the star-studded Metiers d’Arts show.

She told MailOnline: 'I think this incident really demonstrates that regardless of a brand’s status, cultural appropriation and misrepresentation continues to be an ongoing issue in the fashion industry.

She said that Chanel should have learned from previous Native-inspired fashion offenses 
by Urban Outfitters, Victoria’s Secret, and H&M, which should have provided
the label with clear-cut lessons before staging its show.

Miss Brown, a 26-year-old member of the Santee Sioux Nation, and serves as the director of education for Little Earth United Tribes, says that the runway show’s portrayal of Native American fashion represents a gross underassessment of traditional Native American dress as a whole.

‘We have over 566 federally-recognized tribes in the U.S. and very few of those outside of the plains really [wear] anything resembling a headdress.’

She says that headdresses are ‘very tribal specific,’ and that their mass association with Native American culture represents a ‘stereotype.’

In fact, Miss Brown, who resides in Minneapolis, has labeled Chanel’s headdress designs as an ‘offensive mockery.’

Cowboys and Indians: The show was inspired by the old American west

She told us that ‘there is a way of 
working with native communities – you can do it in a beautiful way, but 
when it becomes problematic is when you go off a mainstream stereotype 
that exists and then say your designs are “inspired.”’

Futhermore, Miss Brown says that when included in a tribe’s traditional repertoire, headdresses are a ‘sacred object’ that are only used by tribe leaders in religious ceremonies.

The fashion industry’s cyclical trend cycle often relies on inspirations that are drawn from foreign cultures.

Miss Brown says that she understands this concept, but would find it more appropriate if designers would ‘speak with the people that they are drawing inspiration from, and go to that community where the designs originate.’

She thinks that ‘it’s the responsibility of the company to go about it in an appropriate way and look at artists in those communities to find outlets for collaboration,’ especially in many Native American communities, where handcrafts still provide a large source of income.

Representatives for Chanel issued the following statement to MailOnline: 'The Chanel-Dallas Metiers d'Art 2013/2014 collection is a celebration of the beauty of Texas. Native Americans are an integral part of Texas's rich history and culture and the feather headdress, a symbol of strength and bravery, is one of the most visually stunning examples of the creativity and craftsmanship they possessed.'

The brand’s headdress debacle follows similar moves by lower-priced brands including Victoria’s Secret and Urban Outfitters.

How did it happen? Activists are confused how Karl Lagerfeld and Chanel as a whole did not learn from past scandals experienced by Urban Outfitters and Victoria's Secret

In 2011 Urban Outfitters pulled its ‘Navajo’ range of designs from store shelves after it prompted widespread outrage for its misrepresentation of Native American design.

Similarly, in 2012, Victoria’s Secret faced blowback after it dressed Karlie Kloss in a Native-inspired get-up (headdress included) for the ‘Calendar Girls’ portion of its annual fashion show. Both the brand, as well as Miss Kloss were forced to publicly issue apologies, and Victoria’s Secret ultimately cut the look from its televised broadcast.

Miss Brown says that Chanel’s collection represents ‘so much more than one clothing item, it’s even bigger than the fashion industry. We are talking about issues that at their core are about colonialism and over racism against indigenous people.’
