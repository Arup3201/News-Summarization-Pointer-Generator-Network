Forget the weird but catchy music videos such as ‘What does the fox say’ and ‘Gangnam Style’ –  a new tune has gone viral but you’ll have to sit down before you watch it.

The trick is figuring out exactly how to make something go viral – but if you can’t choose between people dressed in chicken costumes and cartoon chickens – just use both!

Chinese pop singer Wang Rong Rollin, from China, recently released an official pop music video titled 'Chick Chick' but the bizarre clip has left everyone feeling confused.

Chinese pop song ‘Chick Chick’ by Wang Rong Rollin, from China, recently released an official music video but it is no ordinary tune

In the video, the singer dressed in a colourful ball gown with a 70’s hairdo, uses a fairy wand to make a group of female dancers, dressed in Vegas-style showgirl costumes appear.

But they start dancing and flapping their arms like clucking chickens and as the chorus starts, the language of the lyrics sound mostly like barnyard noises as they squawk.

It is reported that the lyrics are  mostly made up of weird and bizarre poultry sounds.

It does lack Gangnam Style’s catchy and imitable dance moves, but in its place are the silliest costumes and the chicken dance 

While the music is playing, there are animated chickens dressed in bikinis as they flap their wings in other scenes or even in the background behind real dancers and the singer.

There are also topless men wearing silver shorts, socks and shoes, as well as farm animal masks over their heads as they are seen dancing in the clip as well.
