Trouble brewing: Residents of Hexthorpe, South Yorkshire, said people would take the law into their own hands unless the authorities step in to combat anti-social behaviour they blame on Roma immigrants

Hexthorpe has a population of 3,300 and 500 Roma residents, most of whom are said to have arrived since January when entry rules to the UK were relaxed.

Villagers claim Roma groups are fly-tipping and leaving litter in the streets. They say they make so much noise at night that elderly residents have to sleep with ear plugs, while others are scared to go outside.

The meeting also heard allegations of assault.

Paul Adams, 44, who works in advertising, said: ‘They don’t care about the village or our community. All they are here for is the benefits.

‘They are here to play the system. They are loud, aggressive and intimidating. They gather in groups in the park and on the streets. They’ve attacked people, threatened people. People are intimidated just leaving the house.

‘They throw rubbish everywhere, literally out of their windows into their garden, in the knowledge someone from the council will have to clear it up. It is degrading for the street cleaners to have to be treated that way. What these people need is educating in how to be part of the community.’

He said the problems had hit local house prices too warning: ‘It will come to a point where blood will be spilt if things don’t improve.’  

Grandmother Elizabeth Boardman, a widow and former lollipop lady, said she had lived in the village for 30 years and was shocked by the sudden change.

She said: ‘Now I wouldn’t walk down the road on my own because there are groups of them everywhere. I’m scared to pass them, they make me feel intimidated and shaken.

'I try to ignore them but you get scared they are going to hit out at you.

‘If they carry on like this people will take the law into their own hands and there will be riots in the streets and I will be blaming the police for not doing anything sooner.’

Her daughter, mother-of-four, Michele 
Boardman, 44, who is a full time carer to a disabled son said: ‘A Roma 
man threatened to kill my daughters and was holding a knife as they 
walked home one night.

'The police haven’t taken statements yet and the incident happened in April. They don’t care.

‘We
 just want to be able to provide a happy and safe environment to pass 
onto our children and the future generations. The kids can’t understand 
why they can’t go and play in the park any more. It’s just not safe for 
them.

‘The police need to be
 firmer with them and act now or there will be riots here like there 
were eight years ago when Iraqi, Kosovans and English clashed. These 
people need to learn to respect the area they live in and the people 
they are living with.’

One 
angry resident told the police officers at the meeting: ‘We feel as 
though you are scared of them and it’s to hell with the British. We’ve 
lost faith in you. This is our village, it’s time you got off your 
backsides and start doing something.’

Another
 resident said she had been warned to take down England flags she had 
put up outside her house for the World Cup bid, for fear of reprisals 
from the Roma community.

Roma in the Page Hall area of Sheffield: A package of measures has been introduced in a bid to calm tension and the police team is being taught their language to engage with the migrants directly

■  Police are learning to speak the Roma language as part of an effort to tackle community unrest in an inner city suburb.

A specialist community police team has been drafted in to prevent clashes between hundreds of Roma Slovak migrants and local residents upset at their ‘anti-social behaviour’ in the Page Hall area of Sheffield.

A package of measures has been introduced in a bid to calm tension and the police team is being taught their language to engage with the migrants directly rather than work through interpreters.

They are patrolling the streets seven days a week and have a permanent base in the area. The South Yorkshire Police team has been tasked with helping agencies resolve issues and problems.

Inspector Chris Lewis, who is in charge of the team, said: ‘Everything is about raising standards - improving housing, cleaning up the streets, creating more open space, providing more recreational opportunities - helping people to take pride in the area.’

Last year local Labour MP David Blunkett warned that tensions between residents and Roma migrants could escalate into violence if the problem wasn’t tackled effectively.
