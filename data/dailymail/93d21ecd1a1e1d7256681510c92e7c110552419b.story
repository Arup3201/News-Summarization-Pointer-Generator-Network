Prison-bound former Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. plans to sell his $2.5 million home in Washington D.C. to help pay $750,000 in penalties stemming from his sentence for illegally spending campaign funds on personal items.

The ex-Illinois congressman's lawyers and prosecutors mentioned the plan in a joint filing today in U.S. District Court in Washington.

The 2,936 square foot, four bedroom home was bought by the couple in 2008 and they have listed it for $2.5 million, according to celebhomes.net.

They asked the judge to give Jackson more time to come up with the money. They also noted one effort to raise cash fell through.

An online auction to sell celebrity 
memorabilia owned by Jackson was cancelled after the authenticity of a 
guitar supposedly signed by Michael Jackson and Eddie Van Halen was 
questioned.

The filing says no memorabilia will now be sold.

The 48-year-old Chicago Democrat is expected to begin serving a 2 1/2-year prison term within weeks.

Jackson
 Jr. was sentenced to two and a half years in prison in August for 
illegally spending $750,000 in campaign funds on personal items, the 
judge scolding the son of the famed civil rights leader for using the 
money as a 'piggy bank' and sentencing his wife to a year as well.

However,
 Jackson, who emotionally apologized to his father, mother, 
congressional colleagues and others, was given significantly less prison
 time than federal guidelines recommend, recognized by the judge as a 
'complex person' who has done both good and bad.

Sandi Jackson, a former Chicago alderman, was sentenced for filing false joint federal income tax returns.

After prison, the former congressman 
is to spend three years on supervised release and complete 500 hours of 
community service. If he earns credit for good behavior in prison, he 
could end up serving closer to two years. He agreed to repay the 
$750,000 when he pleaded guilty earlier this year.

According
 to court documents, the Jacksons had spent campaign money on TV's, 
restaurant dinners, an expensive watch and other costly personal items.

Jackson,
 48, had been a Democratic congressman from Illinois from 1995 until he 
resigned in November 2012. In an emotional speech to the judge, he choked 
up and used tissues to blow his nose. He apologized and said he wanted 
to 'take responsibility for my actions.'

'I
 misled the American people. I misled the House of Representatives. I 
misled the Federal Election Commission,' he said. 'I was wrong.'

'I also want to apologize to my dad and to my mother,' Jackson added, stopping to compose himself.

The
 elder Jackson, who sat in the front row during the proceedings, told a 
crush of reporters outside the courthouse later: 'This has been an 
extraordinarily difficult time for our family.'

In
 court, U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson recognized Jackson Jr.'s 
public service on issues such as public education and clean water. 
'That's what makes this situation so tragic,' she said.
