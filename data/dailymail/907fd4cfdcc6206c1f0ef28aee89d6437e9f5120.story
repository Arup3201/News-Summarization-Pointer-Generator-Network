A Mexican budget airline has apologised to passengers who watched sticky tape placed over a hole in a jetliner's engine come off mid-flight.

Holidaymakers aboard the VivaAerobus Flight 1100 en-route from Tampico to Monterey, Mexico, were aghast when they saw the makeshift engine repair.

Their horror only deepened when the tape apparently couldn't stand the pressure of the flight, peeling off and leaving a gaping hole.

VivaAerobus has insisted the plane was not in danger at any point during the incident, which was videoed by one of the passengers and posted online.

Garcia Honandes, an aviation specialist, said: 'The plane had lost a lid covering in one of the engine mounts.

'It seems workers decided to place the adhesive tape on it as a temporary repair measure.'

According to the airline the adhesive tape did not affect the airworthiness of the plane.

'The high-speed tape, which is not an adhesive tape or duct tape as some passengers said in social networks, is a tape designed and certified to do this kind of temporary repairs', said the airline.

The airline also said that although the tape came off during the flight, 'it did not compromise at any moment the safety of the airplane, which can fly without the lid.'

The airline said it understands that passengers became alarmed during the flight and 'deeply regrets' the situation.

Gabriela Etienne Ortega was one of the passengers aboard the flight and confirmed that the adhesive tape was real.

'I am going to tape your heart like a turbine in VivaAerobus, with adhesive tape', said one Twitter user.

'If you have never traveled with VivaAerobus now you're eveb less likely to, scary!' tweeted another.

Customers faced delays of up to three hours after a Warsaw-bound plane and an aircraft from Frankfurt Hahn that had just landed collided in the parking area of Stansted at about 6.45am.

VivaAerobus said the wing tip of one plane and the tail cone of another ‘made contact’, while Essex Police revealed routine breath tests on both pilots returned zero readings and no one was hurt.
