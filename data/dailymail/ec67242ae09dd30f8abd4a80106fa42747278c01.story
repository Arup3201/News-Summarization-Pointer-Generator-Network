A rail operator in Japan has unveiled a prototype high-speed magnetic levitation , or 'maglev', train which uses state-of-the-art technology to hit speeds of 310mph.

Last week Central Japan Railway Co. (JR Tokai) revealed its Series L0 prototype, which it plans to operate on one of Japan's busiest routes from 2027.

Maglev trains use magnets to lift the train above the track, eliminating friction to provide a faster and quieter service.

Speed: The maglev train can hit speeds of 310mph and is expected to run between Tokyo and Nagoya. It will cover the 200 miles in just 40 minutes

JR Tokai says it aims to run the train between Tokyo and Nagoya, Japan's third largest incorporated city, on the JR Chuo Shinkansen Line, a route currently served by Japan's high-speed bullet trains. If approved, the new train will pass to the northwest of of Mount Fuji.

Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism is examining the proposal. The service is planned to be expanded to Osaka by 2045 at an estimated cost of £64billion.

The manufacturers claim that maglev technology is less polluting than the flights that currently link the cities.

The new train features a streamlined nose similar to those on its bullet train counterparts, which reduces wind drag. JR Tokai expects it to comprise 14 carriages which will each hold 68 people.

A commercial maglev station is in operation in Shanghai, China. The Shanghai Maglev Train or Shanghai Transrapid connects Shanghai Pudong International Airport and the outskirts of central Pudong, a distance of 30km.

The top operational commercial speed of this train is 268 mph, making it the world's fastest train in regular commercial service since its opening in 2004. It cost $1.3billion (£830million) to build.
