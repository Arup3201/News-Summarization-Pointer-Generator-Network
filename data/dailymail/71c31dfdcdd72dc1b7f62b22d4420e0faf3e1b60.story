Sexually-charged videos and explicit lyrics are so endemic in the pop industry that parents are unable to protect their children from them, a disturbing survey has revealed.

More than four-fifths of mothers and fathers have caught young children repeating offensive words or phrases from songs without knowing what they mean.

The tide of sexual and violent imagery means that by the age of ten more than half understood the raunchy references anyway.

One in thirteen parents reported that they had caught their children copying Miley Cyrus' 'twerking' moves

Pop stars’ images push girls into being ‘sexual too soon’ according to two-thirds of parents and a similar proportion say boys expect women to have ‘unrealistic porn star bodies’.

A quarter said boys thought women wanted men to be ‘into violence and gangsta culture’.

The extent to which the pornification of pop has been normalised in children’s lives is demonstrated by the fact that a third of parents said their kids have acted out ‘porn-style dance moves’, such as pole-dancing.

Lady Gaga's outfits on prime time shows such as the X-Factor have prompted complaints from parents, who believe they are not suitable for children

One in 13 also reported their children copying Miley Cyrus’s degrading ‘twerking’ performance at the MTV Video Music Awards in August.

Three-quarters of adults attempt to shield their children from provocative music videos, many of which are freely available on television music channels during the day.

But their efforts are undermined by lewd spectacles on what is supposed to be family viewing.

Two-thirds said their children were exposed to unhealthy images on pre-watershed shows such as the X Factor - proving channels and regulators are out of step with the values of ordinary members of the public.

Lady Gaga prompted more than 100 complaints to Ofcom last month after appearing on The X Factor dancing provocatively in underwear. ITV responded by saying her performance was not ‘inappropriate for the family audience’.

It followed appearances by Rihanna and Christina Aguilera in skimpy clothes on the programme in 2010. Ofcom was criticised at the time for saying the performances were ‘at the very margin of acceptability’.

Attempts to bleep out offensive lyrics on the television and radio are pointless because children often ask what the words are. Many find out anyway by talking to friends or hearing a purchased version that is uncensored.

The extent of the problem was revealed in an online survey of more than 1,500 Netmums members with children under the age of 16.

Almost nine in ten complained modern pop stars were ‘far more explicit’ than those from their own youth.

Stars such as Miss Cyrus, Rihanna and 
Lady Gaga send negative messages to youngsters, according to more than 
two-thirds who young girls were learning to ‘flash your body and be 
sexual to get noticed’.

One in ten said it enforced the belief that 
girls are ‘just sexual objects’.

Only one in 50 parents agreed with pop acts’ claims that their behaviour is ‘empowering’. More than half said they were more like porn stars and a quarter believed artists - particularly female singers - were exploited by the music business.

Parents singled out songs including Robin Thicke’s ‘Blurred Lines’, which has been banned by about 20 student unions for trivialising rape.

Other bad influences include Rihanna’s ‘S&M’ and Nicki Minaj’s ‘Starships’.Netmums founder Siobhan Freegard said: ‘Modern parents aren’t prudes - they know sex sells. But there’s a strong feeling that things have gone too far now.

‘It’s toxic to tell young kids casual sex and violence are something to aspire to. Instead, if a star wants to make a statement, why not use their brain, not their body.’

The survey follows comments yesterday by the head of an exclusive boarding school who complained teenage girls were receiving damaging mixed messages from role models who ditch clean-cut images for raunchy personas.

Jo Heywood, who runs £30,000-a-year Heathfield School in Ascot, Berkshire, highlighted the transformation of Miss Cyrus, who previously starred as a wholesome all-American teenager in Hannah Montana on the Disney Channel.
