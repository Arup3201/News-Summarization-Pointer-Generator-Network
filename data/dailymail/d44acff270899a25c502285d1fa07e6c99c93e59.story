Manchester City are 'really struggling' right now and Manuel Pellegrini could find himself sacked if he fails to turn his club's fortunes around soon, believes Rodney Marsh.

Wednesday's 2-0 home defeat to Newcastle United in the Capital One Cup - a trophy which Pellegrini lifted last season - ensured City have failed to win in three matches.

They sit six points behind leaders Chelsea in the Premier League and face bitter rivals Manchester United in the derby on Sunday before a crunch clash with CSKA Moscow in the Champions League next Wednesday.

And Marsh, who scored 36 goals in 118 league appearances for City, is adamant Chilean Pellegrini could soon find himself following in the footsteps of ex-manager Roberto Mancini, who lost his job just a season after lifting the title.

Marsh told TalkSport: 'I think he (Pellegrini) will get the sack. There is every chance if this carries on that Pellegrini will be out the same as Mancini was.

'If Pellegrini carries on like this, and Man City don't win the league or get to the final at least of the Champions League, I think Pellegrini is sacked.'

Interestingly, it is not just the terrible run of results that worries former England international forward Marsh, but also the poor form shown by Pellegrini's squad.

The Sky Blues threw away a two-goal lead in Moscow last week to draw 2-2 with CSKA and then lost 2-1 against West Ham United at Upton Park on Saturday. 

'Man City have got loads of world class players that, apart from David Silva and Sergio Aguero, are all playing ordinary football at the same time,' he continued.

'When you have that, it doesn't matter how brilliant the players are, if you are not pulling in the same direction you are going to struggle.

'I heard this morning that they are the oldest squad of players in the whole of the Premier League and, at the moment, I think City are really struggling.'
