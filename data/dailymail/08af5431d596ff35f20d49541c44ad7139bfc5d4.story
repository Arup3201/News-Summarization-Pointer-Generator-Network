Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown was at Wembley to see his former side collect some silverware in the traditional curtain raiser to the Premier League season.

Here is what he learned from Arsenal's 3-0 victory over Manchester City in the Community Shield...

1. Joe Hart or Willy Caballero? 

Caballero showed nothing at Wembley to suggest he should start ahead of Hart next season.

Glove and war: Willy Caballero is unlikely to replace Joe Hart when the Premier League season starts

Caballero maybe should have done better for Santi Cazorla's opener, and he didn't have much chance with Olivier Giroud's goal. 

Manuel Pellergrini may feel Hart will operate better when he is under severe pressure. Things will become much clearer when Pellegrini names his team for Newcastle next week.

2. Arsenal's new £30million man didn't stop running

Alexis Sanchez showed brilliant intelligence coming of the right wing and he will terrorise defenders with his pace this year.

He was hugely impressive, but it wasn't any more than I expected. He is a guy who isn't frightened of hard work.

3. City different team without Kompany 

Vincent Kompany is one of the world's best defenders, he'll go down as one of the best in Premier League history, so it's no surprise City missed on Sunday.

They aren't the same without him. They seriously missed his pace on the break yesterday .

4. Chambers makes case for the defence

As a centre-back I thought it was another huge step in the right direction for the youngster Calum Chambers. 

I was particularly impressed with his tenacity and intelligence. When he made interceptions he didn't just look to clear it, he would look to pick someone out. He's made an excellent start to his Arsenal career.

5. Arsenal need a holding midfielder 

Mikel Arteta and Mathieu Flamini will fill Arsenal's midfield lynchpin role next season, but the club should start looking at a long term successor in that position. 

Chambers could be the answer in that role in the long term, but at the moment they need him at the back. 

They need a little bit more pace through the middle of the park.
