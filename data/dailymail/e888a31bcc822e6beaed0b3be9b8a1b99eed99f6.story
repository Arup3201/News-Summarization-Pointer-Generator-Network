A Michigan police officer has been taken off patrol duty after admitting telling a black man with disabilities to sing and dance.

Officers in Grosse Pointe Park will also be made to undergo sensitivity training after the humiliating videos were made public.

The grainy clips, apparently filmed on cell phones, show a man making strange noises and being told to sing.

An officer has been suspended after claiming responsibility of the videos that show black men being told to sing and make animal noises

In another, a man off camera says: 'Go ahead. Do your song - the song... drink, drink, drink'.

The clips were apparently shared among officers and their families.

According
 to Steve Neavling, who first published the videos on his Motor City 
Muckraker blog, African-Americans were ordered to sing or 'dance like a 
chimp'.

He also published an
 image of a man riding in a trailer, that an officer allegedly forwarded
 to others in a text that read: 'Got to love the coloreds'.

The blog named one officer in one of the videos as Mike Najm.

Michael Scipio, 55, from Detroit, says he is the man filmed in the videos.

He told reporters that he is regularly stopped by police but does not know who filmed the video.

He added: 'It made me feel like a fool.'

Greg
 Bowens, spokesman for Grosse Pointe Park police, said an officer had 
claimed responsibility for the video but did not name him.

Mr
 Neavling said on his blog that he has seen other, even more humiliating
 videos of officers filming black men in the area and that he was 
working on passing them to police.

The videos have caused outrage since they were made public last week.

Minister
 Malik Sahazz of the Marcus Garvey Movement, voiced his support for Mr 
Scipio and called on all officers involved to be fired.

He told The Detroit News: 'What kind of fun is it to take advantage of someone. It's humiliating.'

The police have since apologized.

Mr
 Bowens said: 'We all feel deeply, deeply sorry for the video we saw on 
the website. This is not a true reflection of the people of the city of 
Grosse Pointe Park.'
