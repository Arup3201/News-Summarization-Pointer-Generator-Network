A Honduran-born woman is sheltering in a church with her two US citizen children  in a bid to avoid deportation. 

Angela Navarro, who has been living in Philadelphia for the past ten years, gave up her house and moved into a church seeking sanctuary from federal authorities.

Mrs Navarro arrived in the United States as a 17-year-old but failed to secure permission to remain in the country and was issued with a deportation order.

Her parents arrived in the country in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch in 2003 and were granted permission to stay. 

Mrs Navarro remained in the U.S. illegally, but got married to a U.S. citizen and had two children who were both born in the United States. 

Speaking on Christmas Eve, Mrs Navarro said: 'The hardest part has been leaving my life behind — leaving my house, my job, the inability to do normal family things, like going out for a walk or going shopping.'

The 28-year-old mother of two hopes that immigration authorities will not enter a church to forcibly evict her from the country. 

On November 18, Mrs Navarro, her husband and two children moved into a multi purpose room at the church in West Kensington, Philadelphia.

Since moving into the church in November, Mrs Navarro has been unable to leave out of fear of deportation 

It is believed there are approximately a dozen illegal immigrants currently staying in churches across the nation in the belief that they are safe from deportation. 

The West Kensington Ministry is led by Adan Mairena, who is a member of the Sanctuary 2014 coalition, who provide support for illegal immigrants in fear of federal authorities. 

He said: 'It's a way for us to act out our faith.'

Since last summer, three immigrants in sanctuary have won government reprieves and two have left their churches because they felt safe, coalition spokesman Sidney Traynham said. 

Four besides Mrs Navarro remain in refuge in churches in Denver, Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona.

Attorney Patricia Camuzzi Luber recently filed paperwork asking officials to suspend Navarro's deportation order and review her case in light of her marriage and Obama's executive actions, which could grant legal status to those who arrived in the U.S. as minors or who have American children.

Officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement said their main priority, when it came to deportation, was sending home ether recently arrived immigrants or those who have felony convictions

Because Mrs Navarro's case remains unsettled, she stayed at the church last week while supporters rallied outside Philadelphia's office for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 

'Her mother made a tearful plea, and Mr Mariana presented officials with a stack of petitions supporting her mom's request to stay, including a letter from U.S. Representative Bob Brady, a Democrat who represents part of the city.

ICE officials wouldn't meet with the group but released a statement saying their agency 'remains focused on smart and effective immigration enforcement that prioritises the removal of convicted criminals and recent border entrants.' 

Mrs Navarro doesn't fall under either category.

Mrs Navarro's children continue to attend school, and her husband still works as a truck driver, but she won't leave the West Kensington property while continuing her campaign  with the help of the local New Sanctuary Movement.

Posters outlining her to-do list cover the doors to her makeshift bedroom, which looks more like a glorified closet. A portable wall in the main area separates the kids' sleeping area from the crowded living room. Meals are prepared in the church's kitchen, where food and appliances are tagged with notes labeled 'Angela's stuff.' Volunteers built a full bathroom before the family moved in.
