A task force which includes the combined resources of the Australian Crime Commission (ACC), Australian Federal Police, Customs and Border Protection, State and Territory police has seized crystal meth with a street value of close to $1 billion in less than two years - and yet it's barely put a dent in the 'ice pandemic'

At least 25 organised crime gangs have been broken up, three major commercial drug laboratories shut down and members of a Mexican cartel were recently arrested.

But new figures revealed by the ACC to Daily Mail Australia show that in the past few months, the production, importation and use of 'ice' has gone to another level.

The Eligo National Task Force and its various agencies has captured more than $350 million worth of 'ice' in less than three months across Australia

The ACC and AFP were part of the operation in which authorities recently seized 135 kilograms of crystal methylamphetamine andseized and arrested four men in Victoria

Australian Crime Commission Acting Chief Executive Officer, Paul Jevtovic admitted that the syndicates work are working high level of sophistication and 'provides a disturbing picture of the transnational nature of organised crime'.

And the criminal involvement is not restricted to local manufacturers and distributors.

'The fact that Australian illicit drug users pay a premium price for most illicit drugs compared to prices in key foreign markets, makes Australia an attractive market for manufacture and importation of methylamphetamine,' Mr Jevtovic said.

To illustrate how bad the problem has become, the ACC produced figures comparing the first year of the national task force against the latest available for the first quarter of this financial year.

The disturbing increase of 'ice' production and use in Australia. The Crime Commission reports that the national task force focusing on illicit drugs and money laundering has found crystal meth is now at 'pandemic' proportions

From the year January 2013 to the following January in 2014, more than 530 kilograms, worth more than half a billion dollars was intercepted by the Eligo National Task Force (ENTF).

But in the past two months alone, the same union of Australian agencies has closed the net on several syndicates attempting to get up to 350 kilograms of the illicit substance on the streets.

Across the last week of July, a joint operation across Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania resulted in the seizure of more than 220 kilograms of illicit drugs, the majority of that haul was 'ice'.

It means law enforcement agencies are getting results but they're having to come up with different strategies. And while authorities would not be drawn, there are suggestions that officers are being more regularly embedded as operatives within gangs.

'With its relative accessibility, affordability and destructive side-effects, crystal methylamphetamine is emerging as a pandemic akin to the issue of crack cocaine in the United States' says Paul Jevtovic

The ACC's list of side-effects of 'ice' include; psychosis, paranoia, anxiety, depression, decreased memory, violent streaks, risk of heart failure and stroke

Mr Jevtovic said only that 'non-traditional law enforcement measures aimed at disrupting and deterring organised crime groups have been used'.

'We've been better able to unearth an elaborate network.'

The main detections at the Australian border have originated from India, China and Hong Kong in numbers but Mexico and Canada by weight.

Iranian produced meth have begun making its way in and increasing numbers are being tracked from West African crime groups.

In a submission to Victorian Parliament the ACC stated that 'organised crime groups which may have traditionally focused on importing particular illicit drugs, for example heroin or cocaine, have commenced importing multiple illicit commodities, particularly methylamphetamine'.

The ACC boss labelled this 'an emerging pandemic'.

'With its relative accessibility, affordability and destructive side-effects, crystal methylamphetamine is emerging as a pandemic akin to the issue of crack cocaine in the United State.' 

More than 100,000 people were arrested on drug-related charges in Australia in the year 2012-13

Mr Jevtovic also warned that international crime syndicates are now competing with traditional producers (in some cases they have joined forces) for a piece of the local 'ice' market.

'No one criminal syndicate, crime group or ethnicity-based group is dominant in the methylamphetamine market,' he said.

'The methylamphetamine market is sufficiently diverse and profitable to support a large number of competing and sometimes collaborating suppliers, at different levels of sophistication.

'There is also evidence that some crime groups that previously specialised in other drug markets are now focusing their activities on the methylamphetamine market.'

The ACC say 'there is also evidence that some crime groups that previously specialised in other drug markets are now focusing their activities on the methylamphetamine market'

Tougher still for authorities, because of the lucrative nature of the 'ice' trade, criminals are now joining forces 'at different stages of the methylamphetamine supply chain, or to collaborate on an importation or local supply'.

Crystal meth comes in four forms normally being tablet, crystal, base (or paste) and powder.

'The increase in imports (of the drug) does not appear to have coincided with a decrease in local production.' 

According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, methylamphetamine accounts for more than 70 per cent of global amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) seizures.

The ACC warning that 'border detections and domestic seizures are at record levels. The Australian market remains robust and is likely expanding'.
