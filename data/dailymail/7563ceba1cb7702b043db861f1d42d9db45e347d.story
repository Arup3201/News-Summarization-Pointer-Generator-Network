A San Francisco Bay Area private all-girl Christian high school has won the ire of parents after an ill conceived decision to put fried chicken, cornbread and watermelon on a Black History Month celebration lunch menu.

Officials at Carondelet High in Concord have had to dole out some serious apologies for the debacle, which some students actually first conceived on Friday as a way to celebrate the holiday.

But good intentions weren't enough to keep community members angry at the arguably racist menu at bay.

Bad idea: A private Christian high school in Northern California has apologized for putting fried chicken, cornbread and watermelon on the menu for a month honoring back history month

'Chicken, watermelon, collard greens,' University of San Francisco professor James Taylor told KNTV. 'These stereotypes of black Southern culture come from the same place that the N-word comes from.'

Apologies: Principal Nancy Libby quickly apologized for the outrageous mistake. 'Please know that at no time at Carondelet do we wish to perpetrate racial stereotypes,' she said

Because of responses like Taylor's that school officials held an assembly Wednesday to discuss the issue.

Officials also sent a letter apologizing to parents.

Principal Nancy Libby wrote that the items were taken off of the menu and that the last thing the school wanted was to appear in any way racially insensitive.

'I'd like to apologize for the announcement and any hurt this caused students, parents or community members,' Principal Libby wrote in the letter. 'Please know that at no time at Carondelet do we wish to perpetrate racial stereotypes.'

According to KNTV, members of the school's black student union approached school officials asking that just the watermelon be taken off the menu.

Libby said the entire menu, including the chicken and cornbread, would be nixed.

She also said the school plans to hold a racial sensitivity assembly for both faculty and students.

Neither Libby nor the school's dean of students would discuss the matter directly with media.

Meanwhile, Professor Taylor emphasized just how wrong the school was in ever making the decision.

'This is not like, "This food represents this heroic moment in African-American experience." What it represents is the degradation and the stereotyping of African-Americans.'
