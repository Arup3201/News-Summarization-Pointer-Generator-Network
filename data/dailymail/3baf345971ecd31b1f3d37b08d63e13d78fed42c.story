A former ISIS member, believed to be an Australian national, has revealed how he escaped the terror group after witnessing the horrific executions of Westerners in Syria.

The man, who identified himself as Abu Ibrahim, converted to Islam and spent six months fighting as part of Islamic State in Syria, relishing his life under Sharia Law.

Despite approving of the executions of locals for crimes such as adultery, Ibrahim said that the killing of Westerners concerned him, prompting him to leave the death cult.

A man identifying himself as Abu Ibrahim claims he left ISIS after witnessing Westerners being executed

'Some of the policies, like I said, with the beheadings of non-combatants. Some of those things I don’t agree with,' Ibrahim said.

The man, believed to be in his 30s, was interviewed by a CBS journalist under the condition that his voice be changed and his face be hidden from view. 

Despite the distortion of his voice, Ibrahim's Australian accent is clear, an indication of why the barbaric executions of Westerners may have shocked him.

While he said that the enforcement of Sharia law was something that many Muslims 'look forward to', 'seeing someone die is not something anyone probably would want to see'. 

Ibrahim said that he had witnessed at least one crucifixion and stoning for a local couple accused of adultery, but wasn't troubled by the barbaric punishment.

He explained the conditions of living under Sharia law and what life is really like for the members of Islamic State. 

He said that it was the role of the religious police, the Hisbah, to enforce Islamic code.

Ibrahim is believed to be in his 30s and appears to have an Australian accent 

Behaviour such as women not covering their heads, men shaving, and music playing are all cause for punishment under Sharia law. 

'A lot of people when they come they have a lot of enthusiasm about what they’ve seen online, what they’ve seen on YouTube. They see it as something a lot grander than what the reality is - it’s not all military parades or victories,' he told CBS.

Up to 20,000 members of Islamic State are believed to be foreigners, with up to 3,400 of these from Western nations- including an approximated 100 from Australia. 

The men are provided with food, housing, and a $50 stipend to support themselves while they offer their service to ISIS, reported The Daily Telegraph. 

The money is doubled during winter in order that the men are able to buy proper winter clothes.

While Ibrahim said that he wanted to live under Sharia law, he was bothered by the killing of Westerners, such as aid worker Kayla Mueller (above)

Ibrahim said that he would like to return home, but was afraid of the consequences if he was to arrive back in the country.

He feared being imprisoned by ISIS when he attempted to leave, afraid of being questioned and detained by the 'brotherhood' that he had chosen to join. 

Ibrahim said that ISIS executed members they believed to be spies, and were extremely concerned about infiltration.

In the end, he decided that he was no longer fulfilling to reasons he had travelled to Syria in the first place- to aid humanitarian efforts- and, missing his family, made the risky exit from the terror organisation.

He said that many of the men within ISIS were becoming disillusioned and scared, while the morale of others was growing even stronger.  

Professor Greg Barton, from Monash University's Global Terrorism Research Centre, said terror recruiters lured targets by making friends through social media, like many sexual predators. 

Around a quarter of those who have fled to the Middle East to fight with Islamic State have been killed, as new warnings say that key battlegrounds such as the town of Kobane on the Turkish-Syrian border are fast becoming 'graveyards' for naive foreign fighters.  

Intelligence has also been leaked that Australian women are travelling to Syria to be brides for members of Islamic State, with many being sold as sex slaves.
