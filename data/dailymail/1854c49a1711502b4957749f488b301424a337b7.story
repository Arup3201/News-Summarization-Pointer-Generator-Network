MEPs in Brussels cost three times more than MPs in Westminster, shocking new figures reveal.

The annual bill for a member of the European Parliament is almost £1.8million, compared to £590,000 for politicians in the House of Commons.

Critics condemned the ‘eye watering’ sum, and blamed the insistence of the European Parliament on having three different homes. Eurocrats said it was like ‘like comparing apples and oranges’.

The average cost of an MEP is almost £1.8million, almost three times the £590,000 bill for MPs in the Commons

David Cameron has repeatedly demanded cuts in the running costs of the entire European project.

Late last year the Prime Minister was dumbfounded to discover that during a summit at which member states refused to impose reductions on EU spending, leaders were quaffing £120 bottles of wine.

New figures released by Treasury minister Lord Sassoon give a breakdown of how the cost of politicians varies wildly.

Tory MP Chris Heaton-Harris, a former MEP for the East Midlands, said there were lots of ways the European Parliament could 'save a bob or two'

The House of Commons costs £385million-a-year to run with 650 MPs, leaving a per head cost of £590,000.

By contrast the European Parliament had an annual bill of £1.33trillion in 2011, the equivalent of £1.79million for each of the 736 MEPs.

Tory MP Chris Heaton-Harris said: ‘The European Parliament has the most ridiculous system of having three homes, sitting in Strasbourg one a month, Brussels for three weeks and having a library and translation services based in Luxembourg.'

Mr Heaton Harris, a former MEP who not sits on the Commons EU scrutiny committee, added: 'It could save an unbelievable quantity of cash by only going to one place to meet.

‘There are lots of ways it could save a few bob which would contribute to the feeling we are all in this together.’

The figures were obtained by Lord 
Stoddart, who said: These are eye watering figures that make Westminster
 look like very good value for money.’

Mr
 Cameron is due to give a major speech on Europe next week, setting out demands for money and powers to be returned to 
Britain.

The revelation that
 the cost of running the European Parliament which produces reams of 
deeply unpopular diktats is so high will increase pressure for major 
reform.

A spokesman for the European Parliament said comparing it with the House of Commons was like 'comparing apples and oranges'

Matthew Sinclair, 
chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers will be 
angry that the European Parliament is being so extravagant with their 
cash when it comes to organising its own affairs.

‘Those
 responsible for running the Parliament should be looking at finding 
savings in the same way as everyone else is having to do.

‘They
 should start by scrapping the nonsense of moving all the MEPs, staff 
and documentation from Brussels to Strasbourg for a few days each month,
 which currently costs in the region of £150 million a year.’

UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom added: 'The vast cost of the European Parliament, replete with trips to Strasbourg and translation into a smorgasbord of languages, ramps up the costs. 

'Of course one might say that these differentials are right and proper. Given that three quarters of our laws are now made in Brussels, perhaps it is apt that MEPs get three times as much as our Westminster friends.

'UKIP MEPs are campaigning to make all British Euro-MPs a zero cost to the taxpayer by removing ourselves from the EU.'

MPs in Westminster cost the equivalent of £590,000 each, compared to £130,000 for a member of the House of Lords

A spokesman for the European Parliament said: ‘Comparing the cost of running the European Parliament to running the Houses of Parliament is like comparing apples and oranges.

‘The European Parliament is an international organisation operating in 23 official languages, leading to translation and interpretation costs not applicable to the Houses of Parliament.

‘Unlike the Palace of Westminster, most of the European Parliament's office space is rented or leased. And because of a decision made by Member States, including the UK, and enshrined in the Treaties, the EP has two working seats, resulting in extra costs linked to travel, staffing, the upkeep of the buildings, and so on.’

On the same measure members of the House of Lords work out as the best value, costing £130,000 each.
