Taking the leap and getting a tattoo or a piercing while on holiday may seem like an exciting and exhilarating idea, but an Australian medical expert is warning travellers to be aware of hepatitis B and C risks in the Asia-Pacific region.

Hepatitis Australia CEO Helen Tyrell has told the Courier Mail that medical experts are anticipating a rise in the number of Australian people contracting hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) during the coming years.

She says their pessimistic outlook is based on the lifestyles of holidaymakers and their destination choices.

The prevalence of hepatitis C in some Asia-Pacific countries is 10 times higher than it is in Australia

There is currently a vaccine for HBV, but health experts are concerned by the lack of a vaccine for HCV, which is known as 'the silent killer'.

Many who contract the virus have no symptoms for years and even decades before the virus attacks their liver, which can lead to serious health difficulties.

Victims often suffer from serious liver damage while the risk of cancer is also increased.

Holidaymakers should be safety conscious and careful.

Ms Tyrell said: 'What we want all Australians to know before they head off on their overseas holiday is that any activity in which the skin is pierced can lead to infection with hepatitis - and, yes, that can include pedicures, tattoos and piercings, and even getting dental work done abroad.'

She said the disease is contagious and it can be easily passed on from one person to another.

She states if an instrument containing a microscopic amount of infected blood is used to pierce the skin or comes into contact with an open wound it has the potential to transmit the disease.

The Hepatitis Australia CEO also warns: 'Don't engage in activities in which the skin may be pierced unless you're sure the instruments have been fully sterilised.'

Ms Tyrell lists countries in the Asia-Pacific region such as Bali, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines as places where the prevalence of hepatitis C can be 10 times higher than Australia. She says inadequate and poor sterilisation of instruments in tattoo parlours or during pedicures are primarily to blame.

'People on holiday can be more likely to make a spur-of-the-moment decision to take part in more risky activities, like getting a tattoo, so what we're urging Australians to do is pre-plan.

'If you want to get a tattoo or a piercing while you're away, do your research so you can better know your risk. Ask yourself, does the place sterilise its equipment properly? Does the benefit really outweigh the risk?'

The latest research shows that Australian tourists are far more likely now to engage in risky pursuits which puts them at greater risk of contracting hepatitis B and C viruses. 

Ms Tyrell believes this is due to a lack of public knowledge about the ailments. She advises anybody who is anxious that they may have hepatitis B or C to talk to their GP as a matter of urgency.

Intravenous drug use is the most common way that the viruses are spread, however, hepatitis B and C can also be contracted by using items such as toothbrushes, razors and nail clippers.

Last week Ms Tyrell welcomed the decision to add simeprevir (Olysio) to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) for the treatment of genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C.

In a press release issued by Hepatitis Australia, Ms Tyrell said: 'The use of simeprevir as an addition to pegylated interferon and ribavirin to treat people with genotype 1 hepatitis C is an important step forward in the evolution of hepatitis C treatment.'

Ms Tyrell said simeprevir will improve the treatment process as it will make it safer and she called for the therapy to be listed on the PBS as soon as possible.

The CEO also criticised the Pharmaceutical Benefit Advisory Committee (PBAC) for their decision to decline an application to subsidise sofosbuvir (Sovaldi), an antiviral medication.

She said: 'It's a sad day when access to game-changing therapy is denied. This is a bad outcome for people living with hepatitis C.'
