It is a very different type of sporting event.

While it features athletes at the peak of their physical and mental fitness, rather than energy drinks, these athletes will just need a plug socket.

And before competition has even started, two robots dubbed 'Usain Volt' and 'The Mobot' copied the trademark poses of their Olympic namesakes - as they went in search of their own gold medals.

The machines are among 200 competitors from all over the world taking part in the Federation of International Robotics Association annual 'Olympic' games, called the RoboWorld Cup.

Usain Volt and Mobot the Robot are part of a team from Plymouth University, who have robots competing in football, sprint and marathon events.

Just like 100m hero Usain Bolt, Usain Volt will be defending his title 
as world champion in the sprint through a twisting three-metre course.

But unlike Bolt - who has size 13 feet - Volt wears size 3k children's Adidas trainers.

Meanwhile, Mobot the Robot will be copying his namesake Mo Farrah as he 
takes part in the long-distance event, an 84 metre 'marathon' on 
Saturday.

The endurance event will truly test the smiling robot to his limit - the outdoor course includes inclines, twists and turns.

Plymouth University is hoping Volt and Mobot will retain their world championship titles.

Robot Football Research Assistant Peter Gibbons said: 'We have the only robots in the world with shoes on.'

It helps to see errors when they put their foot down, it improves their balance, and most importantly, it looks cute.'

The FIRA RoboWorld Cup takes place at the At-Bristol science centre until Saturday.

It is the first time the UK has ever hosted the annual event, and is 
fielding two teams - one from Plymouth University and the other from 
Bristol Robotics Laboratory.

More than 200 robotics engineers representing 27 teams from across the 
world are competing in events including weightlifting, basketball and 
climbing.

Plymouth University has entered 12 robots, which cost Â£4,000 and include
state-of-the-art processors and parts made from Meccano and perspex.

Peter said: 'We try to give them each their own character and personality.

'That's why they have smiling faces.

'Our robot athletes are happy, and we want the students we help teach to be happy too.'

But Peter, 40, said: 'We won't be seeing these cute humanoid robots in 
the shop any time soon - they are too dangerous at the moment.'

He added: 'People connect with them, because there is a natural instinct in our brains to connect with little people.'

Robotics student Horatio Barton, 21, has been involved robot sprinting for two years at Plymouth University.

He said: 'I just studied robotics and the team at Plymouth are quite friendly and nice so I decided to join in.

'They're lovely - it is such great fun.'

The city won the chance to host the event due to the work of the Bristol Robotics Laboratory (BRL), a joint research project between the University of Bristol and UWE Bristol.

Guido Herrmann, who led the BRL bid, said: 'We are looking forward to welcoming teams from around the world to Bristol.

'The competition promises to be both exciting and insightful, pushing the boundaries of robotics to the limit.

'This will be a fantastic opportunity for the public to see just what autonomous robots are capable of.

'Although very different to the Olympics, it's another opportunity to show the world just what Great Britain is capable of, both as event hosts and being pioneers of engineering.'

The FIRA RoboWorld Cup was founded in 1996.
