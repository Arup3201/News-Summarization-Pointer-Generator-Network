Police and passers-by in a Chinese city are being hailed as heroes after they used their strength to rescue an elderly man who was mowed down by a car.

The incredible moment  recorded by surveillance cameras shows the man being run over at a zebra crossing in Xuancheng City in eastern China's Anhui Province on Wednesday morning.
