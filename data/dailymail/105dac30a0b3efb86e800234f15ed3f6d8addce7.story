At £50 per head, it's not the most expensive of meals, and even comes with a cocktail.

But if Lady Luck smiles on them, customers at the world's first pay-by-poker restaurant could walk away with paying just a fraction of the price... or even get their three-course gourmet feast for free.

All-In Kitchen, which will be opening in Haggerston, London, will see diners' success at the poker table determine how much they pay for their meal.

All-In Kitchen is the world's first pay-by poker restaurant opens between January 19 to 21

The pop-up - a collaboration between PokerStars and Jones & Son restaurant - will be open from January 19-21, with plans to roll out the experience nationwide.

Customers will be able to choose from a poker-inspired menu, exclusively curated by Jones & Sons. 

The gourmet offerings will feature Royal Flush of King Crab Thermidor; Queen Scallops accompanied by salt-baked swede and bacon marmalade; four-of-a-kind lamb chops, rump, kidney and shoulder with rosemary jus and two-pair of pear tarte tatin, pear caramel and ice cream for dessert.

Ordinarily, the cost of this meal, including the bespoke poker-inspired cocktail, is about £50 per head.

Diners could find their dinner is on the house by playing 10,000 chips at the pop-up

But diners could be paying a maximum of £10 for the entire feast by booking at seat at the felt and playing an action-packed three hands of poker, perfect for sharks and novices alike.

Play 10,000 chips and above, and dinner will be on the house. 

Those playing between 5,000 to 10,000 chips will have a small £5 fee to pay 

Those with less than 5,000 chips will still bag a bargain, with the the three-course gourmet feast totalling to £10.

Those who want to simply soak up the experience are welcome as well, although they will have to pay the full price for their dinner.  

Andy Jones, Founder of Jones & Sons, said: 'I love food and never shy away from the tables when I get the chance, so having the opportunity to create a menu that combines two of my favourite things was something I jumped at.

'Embracing Poker within the dishes was a lot of fun and some of the dishes that hit the cutting room floor were a bit out there, but I can't wait to see the results and serve up some Aces.'

The partnership was conceived to celebrate the 2015 UK and Ireland Poker Tour's (UKIPT) London kick off. 

There are plans to roll out the experience nationwide across each stop of the PokerStars UKIPT.

Guest are able to book their place at the restaurant at www.billetto.co.uk/all-in-kitchen.
