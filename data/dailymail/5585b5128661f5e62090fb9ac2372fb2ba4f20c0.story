Virginia Wade describes Mauresmo appointment as a 'joke'

The most remarkable aspect of Andy Murray beginning the defence of his Wimbledon gentleman’s singles title is not that he is the first British man to do so for 77 years, but that there will be a female coach in the players’ box on Centre Court.

Amazing, isn’t it? You wait all this time for a British men’s champion and then he turns out to be a groundbreaker in more ways than one.

In 2014, an elite male tennis player’s decision to hire as his coach a ‘lady’, as we women are so politely called at the All England Club, is considered trailblazing.

Trailblazer: Andy Murray appointed Amelie Mauresmo as his coach - a groundbreaking move in tennis

Virginia Wade, maybe still slightly irked that her 1977 Wimbledon triumph has been overshadowed by a British man doing the business, thinks it ‘a joke’, while others resort to pig-headed sexism when considering Murray’s revolutionary act.

Murray’s decision to appoint Amelie Mauresmo should be celebrated. Tennis is part of a sporting landscape in which only 31 per cent of coaches are women. How many can you name off the top of your head?

Only one of the eight clubs in the top tier of the FA Women’s Super League, for example, has a woman in charge and not one of the world’s top-20 female tennis players has a full-time female coach.

Men are apparently expected to coach other men because, of course, they have ‘played the game’ themselves. And yet there is no barrier to them coaching in women’s competitions that would have been alien to them as players. No daft, old-fashioned arguments about entering locker-rooms or whether late-night tactical analysis might lead to an altogether different type of relationship.

No problem: Murray, who hit the All England Club practice courts on Sunday, defended his appointment of Mauresmo following criticism from Wimbledon legend Virginia Wade (R)

There is a valid argument in tennis for wanting your trainer to also be your hitting partner but a sport such as athletics has no such get-out clause. At a time when many a coach’s beer belly provides a useful shelf for his stopwatch, only three female coaches had athletes competing for Britain at the weekend’s European Team Championships in Germany.

Christine Bowmaker, who coaches Asha Philip and Jodie Williams — two of the country’s most talented young sprinters — quickly provides an insight as to why that might be.

Bowmaker is married with two children, aged six and eight, and is also a part-time PE teacher working in sprinting, with all of its macho, testosterone-fuelled connotations. Her admission that it can be ‘very, very challenging’ is clearly something of an understatement.

‘At some points it hasn’t been a labour of love,’ she says. ‘There were times that, because of the  sexism in the sport, of not being recognised or valued for the contribution I made, I did think “What’s the point?”

‘But then 
I’m not in it to be put on a pedestal. What motivates me is seeing 
athletes achieve what they want to achieve, on whatever level that might
 be. And if I give up, it won’t get any better.

‘You have to be a certain type of character to survive. You have to be strong because coaching is hard.’

It is hard, as well as being time-consuming, unsociable and voluntary for more than three-quarters of the UK’s coaches, none of which are exactly conducive to bringing up a family. There are therefore scarily few role models for female coaches, while stereotypes about women offering better emotional support but less authority seem to persist.

‘It’s great to see a female like Mauresmo in the limelight,’ says Bowmaker.

‘It’s amazing she’s doing it. When you see another female coach it’s so exhilarating but we have to be good at what we do, too.

‘There’s still a hangover from the past. You ask all athletes, male and female, whether they would like a female coach and I think 90 per cent of them would still say “no”.

‘That won’t change until more female coaches bring more people through, so it’s about staying  professional and pushing yourself.

‘I have to be different from what they expect. I don’t need to be testosterone-driven to be a good coach and if I do a good job then my athletes will keep winning, simple as that.’

Diego Maradona accused FIFA of a ‘lack of respect’ after seven Costa Rica players were drug-tested following Friday’s 1-0 win over Italy, showing yet again just how out of touch football is when it comes to drugs in sport.

Even more disrespectful is FIFA’s claim they are setting a ‘benchmark...in the fight against doping’.

No positive tests at a World Cup since Maradona’s in 1994, so therefore nobody’s cheating? Give over.

PERFORMANCE OF THE WEEKChile's 2-0 win over Spain. This was largely about the demise of Spain, but the joy, work ethic and energy of Chile, the so-called ‘minnows’, were a pleasure to watch.
