At first glance this picture shows a typical scene from the plains of the Masai Mara in Kenya as some Thomson's gazelles stand in front of the beautiful backdrop.

But look again and you notice there is a certain nervousness about them and with good reason. 

If you look really hard you can see a well-camouflaged cheetah stalking them from behind.

Can you see it? At first glance the gazelles stand in front of a beautiful backdrop but there is a reason why they have a certain nervousness about them

The amazing shot of the camouflaged big cat and subsequent chase was taken by wildlife photographer Richard Costin who was tracking the predator for a few days.

Mr Costin, 32, from Kent, said: 'The cheetah stopped in its tracks and looked intently into the distance.

'Experience had taught us what this meant. It had spotted some potentially vulnerable prey, gazelles in some longer grass than they ought to be. 

'Although cheetahs have amazing acceleration, gazelles can run for longer so if the cheetah can't get close before it charges it can be outrun.

'Luckily, the gazelles had wandered into some long grass so it took about five minutes to stalk its way up to them before pouncing.'

However, after the successful hunt and less than an hour's eating, the cheetah was chased away from its kill by a hyaena.

Mr Costin, who takes photography workshops to the Masai Mara, added: 'We had seen it stalk and hunt unsuccessfully a couple of times, but this time it killed one of the gazelles.

'Cheetahs often have to eat as quickly after a kill as they can as you can see, once word gets around there is a kill, something stronger turns up - in this case a hyaena.

'In fact cheetahs are actually quite weak and even a few vultures are normally enough to drive it from its kill.

'This is why it dragged the carcass into longer grass before eating.'

The cheetah is the fastest land animal on the planet being able to accelerate from 0 to 62mph (100km/h) in just three seconds.

Its top speed is 70-75mph (112-120km/h) but it can only run in short bursts of up to 1,600 feet (500m).

Yesterday photographs of wild snow leopards revealed just why the elusive animal is so hard to spot.

Pictured strolling across the face of a mountain, the endangered big cat is barely visible against a background of rock and shale.

Experienced wildlife photographer David Jenkins, 41, braved temperatures of over minus 20 degrees centigrade in an effort to get a glimpse of the creature.
