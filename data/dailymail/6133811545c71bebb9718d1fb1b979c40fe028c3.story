A 37-year-old gay mom is set to spark controversy after she said she'd be disappointed if her six-year-old daughter wasn't gay when she grows up.

Sally Kohn a political commentator who has appeared on CNN and MSNBC, describes herself as living in the 'liberal bubble of Park Slope, Brooklyn, where 'yuppies' want their kids to be happy.

She said: 'I'm gay. And I want my kid to be gay, too.'

In a lengthy essay in The Washington Post  Kohn explained that, she, like most parents simply wants her child to follow in her footsteps. 

She writes: 'If we went to college, we want our kids to go to college. If we like sports, we want our kids to like sports. If we vote Democrat, of course we want our kids to vote Democrat.'

Kohn said: 'When my daughter plays house with her stuffed koala bears as the mom and dad, we gently remind her that they could be a dad and dad. 

'Sometimes she changes her narrative. Sometimes she doesn't. It's her choice.'

'Time will tell, but so far, it doesn't look like my six-year-old daughter is gay. In fact, she's boy crazy.' 

Kohn, a liberal political commentator, community organizer, and founder and chief executive officer of the Movement Vision Lab, a grassroots think tank is also a contributor to the Fox News Channel.

She is raising her six-year-old girl daughter, Willa Hansen Kohn, along with her partner Sarah Hansen, whom she met at the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 2003. 

Hansen works in philanthropy advising foundations how to best support groups in the social and environmental justice movements.

Kohn, however, is no stranger to controversy.

In 2014, she wrote that referring to an undocumented person as an 'illegal immigrant' was like calling a black person the N-word. 

Meanwhile, she often writes about how her sexuality impacts her parenting style.

In a parenting blog for The New York Times she described her experience of being 'a butch lesbian' taking her five year old daughter for a Princess makeover at Disney World. 

She wrote: I have been a tomboy all my life. When I played with dolls they were usually being sacrificed in some sort of erupting volcano-like mud hole in my backyard or running for their lives.'

'My partner and I certainly didn’t teach our daughter to like pink and ruffles and such. And I can’t fathom some genetic or biological nodule that predisposes my girl to like dolls while little boys like trucks. Baloney.' 

She adds: 'Even in the midst of our hyper-liberal and hyper-diverse neighborhood with girls and boys of all kinds on display every day, it happened. 

'Did I do something wrong? Is feminism mysteriously skipping a generation? Meanwhile, I have to bribe her to wear jeans.'

In 2010 she posted a Youtube video of her then two year-old daughter entitled 'My 2 year old explains the Bush tax cuts' featuring the precocious little girl. 

Kohn said: 'If my daughter is gay, I don't worry about her having a hard life. But I do worry about people expecting her to have a hard life — helping to perpetuate discrimination that might otherwise fade'

And while the pundit is known for her outspoken views, she admits that her straight friends have a massive problem with her wanting her daughter to be gay when she grows up.

She wrote: [One friend asked] 'Don't you want her to be happy?'  

She adds: 'A friend once told me 'I wouldn't even choose for myself to be gay.' It was a sad admission, because she was.'

She goes on to suggest that there is a widely-held viewpoint that 'no one would choose to be gay — even in the gay rights movement.'  

She adds: 'I've never for a single second regretted being gay, nor saw it as anything other than an asset and a gift. 

'My parents were ridiculously supportive from Day One, and I had a great community of friends and mentors who made me feel unconditionally accepted. 

'By the time my daughter comes of age, she'll have even more of a support network, including two moms, for crying out loud.

'If my daughter is gay, I don't worry about her having a hard life. But I do worry about people expecting her to have a hard life — helping to perpetuate discrimination that might otherwise fade more quickly. 

'I want my daughter to know that being gay is equally desirable to being straight. 

'The problem is not the idea that homosexuality could be a choice but the idea that heterosexuality should be compulsory. 

'In my house it's plainly, evidently not. We've bought every picture book featuring gay families, even the not-very-good ones and we have most of the nontraditional-gender-role books as well — about the princess who likes to fight dragons and the boy who likes to wear dresses.'
