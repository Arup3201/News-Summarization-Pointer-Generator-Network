Payday: John Pike, the former University of California-Davis officer who sparked outrage when he pepper-sprayed students in 2011, was awarded $38,000 in a worker's compensation settlement  

The former University of California, Davis police officer who made national headlines in 2011 after he pepper-sprayed Occupy protesters has reached a worker's compensation settlement worth nearly $40,000.

A judge on October 16 approved the $38,000 settlement between John Pike and the University of California.

The 40-year-old former officer said he suffered depression and anxiety after death threats were sent to him and his family over the November 18, 2011, incident.

University spokesman Andy Fell said the case was resolved in accordance with state laws.

Video of then-campus Lt Pike dousing peaceful protesters seated on the ground with pepper spray went viral online.

His address and other personal information were posted online afterward by the hacking group Anonymous, and he received scores of death threats.

Pike was fired in July 2012 after eight months of paid administrative leave.

The images of Pike unleashing an orange chemical cloud on the heads of students became a rallying symbol for the Occupy Wall Street movement.

Anonymous disseminated Pike's personal information online. This included his home address, phone number and email address.

A computer-generated voice in the video, posted in November 2011, said: 'Dear Officer John Pike. Your information is now public domain.'

It was then removed because was deemed 'a violation of YouTube's policy prohibiting hate speech.'

Pike received numerous threats that led an Alameda County Court judge to rule against releasing the names of other officers at the scene.

The hackers' video concluded: 'Expect our full wrath. Anonymous seeks to avenge all protesters. We are going to make you squeal like a pig.'

A scathing 190-page report on the 
incident found that university officials and UC Davis police used poor 
judgment and excessive force in the confrontation.

And the incident was widely mocked in
 satirical messages posted on the Internet in which still photos of Pike
 wielding his pepper spray were inserted into famed works or art or pop 
culture images.

The university last fall agreed to 
pay $1million to settle a lawsuit brought on behalf of the 21 students 
who got sprayed and later reported suffering panic attacks, trauma and 
academic problems as a result.

Each of the protesters walked away 
with $30,000, which is less than Pike's payoff, The Davis Enterprise reported. The former Marine is 
also eligible for retirement benefits for his 11 years as a campus 
officer.

In June of this year, Pike himself filed a worker's compensation claim with UC Davis over the incident, saying he suffered unspecified psychiatric and nervous system damage.

According to a psychiatric report released in January, Pike faced 'continuing and significant internal and external stress with respect to resolving and solving the significant emotional upheavals that have occurred' in his life and had not shown evidence of substantial improvement.

After paying covering attorney’s fees, Pike will take home $33,350.
