Anderson Silva has been suspended after failing a second drug test, carried out after his comeback victory over Nick Diaz last month.

The former UFC middleweight champion tested positive for steroids and for anti-anxiety medication, having also failed a test on January 9.

Silva, who has denied taking any performance-enhancing substances, passed a further test on January 19.

The steroid he tested positive for was Drostanolone which is popular with bodybuilders, while there was also traces of Oxazepam and Temazepam, which can be used to treat insomnia.

Although the medication is not banned, it must be noted on the medical questionnaire submitted before any fight.

Silva was already facing a nine-month ban for his first failed test but the Nevada State Athletic Commission chief executive director Bob Bennett did not know if that would be extended.

'I can't speak for the [NSAC] chairman nor can I speak for the commissioners,' he told ESPN.com.

'But something I find particularly concerning is that he tested positive on January 9 and then he tested negative on January 19. If he took this orally, it only stays in your system five to seven days.

'So, obviously, he used it some time around January 9 and then he used it shortly before the night of the fight. Whether the commission finds this egregious - that he tested positive twice out of three times - is up to them. 

'I certainly find it concerning and unacceptable. It gives an unfair advantage to the person on that. God forbid, a serious injury were to occur to an opponent when someone is on something.'

After his first failed test, Silva said: 'I have not taken any performance-enhancing drugs. My stance on drugs is, and will always be, the same. I’m an advocate for a clean sport.'

Silva has denied taking performance-enhancing drugs but will learn his fate at a disciplinary hearing in March

He will learn his fate when the NSAC hold a disciplinary hearing next month.

UFC president Dana White and CEO Lorenzo Fertitta will hold a special press conference on Wednesday in which they are expected to address the drug scandals that have engulfed the organisation in recent months.

Diaz also failed his fight-night drug test for marijuana metabolites while middleweight Hector Lombard failed a test for for a designer steroid after his win over Josh Burkman at UFC 182 last month.

The 37-year-old Cuban tested positive for desoxymethyltestosterone.
