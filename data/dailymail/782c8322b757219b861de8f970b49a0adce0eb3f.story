A maths teacher at one of Britain's top private schools, which was attended by comedian Alan Davies and Towie star Jess Wright, has been jailed for having sex with a 15-year-old pupil.

Dr John Wunderle, 35, was a teacher at £15,000 a year Bancroft's School in Woodford, Essex.

But concern was raised with the girl's parents.

When the girl's mother caught him getting dressed in the teenager's bedroom he insisted there was an innocent reason he was half-naked in their home and said: 'It's all a misunderstanding'  

Her parents were terrified the couple would flee the country as teacher Jeremy Forrest did with a 15-year-old pupil in 2012.

Nicholas Bleaney, prosecuting, told Snaresbrook Crown Court that the victim's parents had taken away her phone and computer to stop further contact. 

But he added that when they grew suspicious that they were still in contact they hired a private detective and gave the girl a phone with a tracking device.

The couple were caught and the teenager discovered under a blanket on the back seat of Mr Wunderle's car after he had been bailed by the police. 

The girl told police that he touched her breasts and bottom over her clothes while they were in the kitchen.

'On 5 June the neighbours alerted her parents to the fact that he was attending their address in the middle of the day, the girl's mother returned home and found the defendant dressing himself in her bedroom,' Mr Bleaney said.

'He said: "It's all a misunderstanding" and the girl was saying that she loved him.

'The school was notified and her parents took away her phone and her computer in an effort to stop them having contact with each other.'

Wunderle at first accept that he had kissed and touched the girl, but later gave a no comment interview to police.

He was bailed on the condition that he have no contact with the teenager, but her parents were suspicious that the pair were managing to maintain contact.

They hired a private investigator who told them to give their daughter a mobile phone fitted with a GPS device so he could track her movements.

Analysis of her phone showed she had searched the internet for the name of the 15-year-old who had run off with Forrest to France in 2012.

Mr Bleaney said: 'On 31 July the private detective intercepted them meeting in his car near Woodford High road.'

The girl told police he had contacted her on Facebook using an alias and they had also been speaking via Twitter.

'After her GCSE results they were planning on running away together, the defendant had mentioned Amsterdam and going on the ferry to Holland but it seems they were short of funds.

'In her victim impact statement she said she now feels she was stupid and that she had been manipulated by the defendant.

He said: 'She felt at the time that she loved him and what was going on was consensual but looking back on it she feels that what she was told by him were lies or at the very least adaptations of the truth and she no feels stupid and deceived.' 

The maths teacher earned £40,000-per-year at the school, which counts the likes of comedian Alan Davies, tennis player Samantha Smith and Jess Wright from hit TV show The Only Way is Essex as part of its alumni.

Jailing him for four years Judge Nigel Peters said: 'These offences are prevalent and this offence occurred in recent times.

'Courts up and down the country have been dealing with offences of this type, many of which are historic, so you would have known that there remains a high public concern about sexual offences involving children and older men, and especially of school teachers who abuse positions of trust.'

He added: 'You've no previous convictions, that goes without saying, you're an extremely intelligent man, you've done extremely well academically and you were teaching at one of the top schools in the country.

'You would have known the prevalence of this offence and the view the courts take of those who get involved with children.'

The girl's younger siblings have since been forced to move schools and the family are planning on relocating to another part of the county for a fresh start while the girl studies for her A-levels.

Wunderle pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual activity with a child and one count of penetrative sexual activity with a child between March and August this year at a pleas and case management hearing in October.

He also pleaded guilty to a further count of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust and one count of inciting sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust.

Nan Mousley, for Wunderle, told the court her client was very bright and held a PhD in maths, but described him as 'emotionally immature'.

She said: 'His position is that he was in love with this girl, he felt it was a good relationship and whilst looking back now he should have turned his back on it, it remains for him an exceptional relationship and one that's never likely to be repeated.'

She added: 'A colleague said that despite being highly intelligent there's a lack of emotional intelligence that can lead to problems.'

'At the time it was a consensual relationship, it might have been unwise, it might have been wrong and I don't seek to minimise it but it was consensual.'

Wunderle, of Waltham Abbey,  sat with his head in his hands throughout the hearing and as he was handed the four year sentence.
