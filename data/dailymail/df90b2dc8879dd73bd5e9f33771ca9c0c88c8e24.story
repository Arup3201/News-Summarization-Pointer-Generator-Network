Getting your own place and moving out from Mum and Dad is every teenager’s dream, but property savvy young Australians have worked out that it’s much better financially to stick with their parents until they're 30 if they want to buy their ideal home.

Today young people all over Australia are happy to live with their parents for as long as possible if it means they can afford to buy the property they want in the right area.

Graham Mirabito of RP Data – the largest provider of property information, analytics and property-related risk management services in Australia and New Zealand – confirmed that many young adults and couples were prepared to stay at home until they were 30 and do things differently.

‘What we’re hearing from the mortgage brokers is that young people today are buying an investment home in an area they’d like to live in, but for the first few years they'll rent it out and let someone else pay for it, while they remain living at home,’ Mirabito explained.

‘It means they are never priced out of that market and they can move when they can afford to. So what we’re seeing from the mortgage brokers is that young couples are happy to buy an investment property but still live with Mum and Dad.

‘Kids are a lot smarter with their money than what we give them credit for today. It’s a new trend to live at home until you’re 30 because there’s no stigma attached to it now. It’s a sensible business decision.’

Mum and Dad could be seeing much more of their children in the future

Many couples are from Chinese, Italian and Greek ancestry where living together as an extended family well into their 20s is traditional. But it also now makes a lot of financial sense.

‘Young couples buy an investment property and let it tick over, then when they do get married they can move in themselves or sell it to get an even better property in that area,’ Mirabito said.

He argued that this new way of thinking caught some developers out in recent years.

‘Developers were building dairy farms in the country into attractive housing lots when the kids looking for places just wanted to live in the city. For 10 years the developers got it wrong to an extent, because the lots were not being bought up as fast as developers thought they would be,’ Mirabito said.

Terraced houses like the ones here at Bourke Street, Surry Hills in Sydney are much sought after 

He also believed that the change of thinking was as much cultural as anything else.

Decades ago Australians used to get married in their early 20s. Their kids had grown up by the time they were in their 30s. They’d live in the suburbs until the kids had flown the nest and then move back into the city.

‘That has all changed. Young people today want to live in the city to start with and have babies later in life,’ said Mirabito. ‘They’ll then bring their kids up in the early years in their city apartment. It’s later on when the kids get older that they’ll move out to the burbs where they can kick the football around.’

Staying at home longer will help young people save more money to buy their ideal home

CoreLogic RP Data’s quarterly review on the Australian residential property market and economy highlighted other reasons why this new phenomenon was taking place.

At the moment first home buyers languish at near record low levels. In September first home buyers accounted for just 12 per cent of all financial housing commitments over the month.

The main reason for this is because since early 2010 temporary first home buyer incentives were removed. Over a 12-month period to September 2014 there were 77,854 commitments by first home buyers which were just 12.5 per cent of all commitments and the lowest annual figure on record.

Houses like these overlooking North Bondi Beach in Sydney will not come cheaply

It all means that the lack of affordable housing available for Australian first home buyers, particularly within the major capital cities, is what’s likely to be contributing to the low number of first home buyers despite historically low mortgage rates.

Young Australians will stay at home first before making a bid on the house of their dreams

The mortgage rates are at near record low levels, because interest rates are at extremely low levels.

However, the trouble is that although mortgage rates are low and home values are increasing, household disposal incomes are hardly rising at all.
