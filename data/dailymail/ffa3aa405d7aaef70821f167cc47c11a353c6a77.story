A mother-of-one launched a frenzied attack on a nurse after spotting her 'kissing' her boyfriend in the back of his van after a night on the town.

Faye Burke, from Manchester, punched the 48-year-old victim seven times, leaving her with blood trickling down her face. 

The 25-year-old is said to have shouted 'I can't believe you're in there with that' before attacking the woman and screaming 'I'm going to kill you, you b****'.

Boom: Faye Burke punched the 48-year-old nurse seven times, leaving with blood trickling down her face

The 25-year-old is said to have shouted 'I can't believe you're in there with that' before clobbering the woman and screaming 'I'm going to kill you, you b****'

The nurse had been out in a bar in the Deansgate area of the city with Burke's then-boyfriend and another man, Manchester Crown Court heard.

After a few drinks, the victim and the boyfriend decided to go into his van, parked outside a bar in the Deansgate area of the city, for a 'kiss'.

But Burke, who was also on a night out in the area, recognised her boyfriend's van and discovered the pair inside.

Burke's boyfriend tried to restrain her but she wriggled free and flung open the van doors, repeatedly punching the 48-year-old until she was knocked unconscious.

When police arrived at the scene the victim was lying motionless on the floor of the van, as Burke continued to punch her in the head.

Prosecutor David Lees said the victim was left 'extremely shocked' by the attack.

In a statement she said: 'I keep reliving the incident in my head and having flashbacks. I thought I was going to die.'

Burke admitted causing actual bodily harm, possessing cocaine and breaching a suspended sentence following the attack in the early hours of August 16.

But she avoided a jail term after Recorder Brian Cummings QC was told of the effect prison would have on her six-year-old daughter.

Burke was handed a four-month sentence, suspended for two years, with a curfew and a requirement to attend a probation service women's programme.

Recorder Cummings described the attack as 'disgraceful' but said that it 'represented a shortlived if serious loss of control at a time of high emotion'.

At the time of the offence, Burke was subject to a suspended sentence for conspiring to smuggle two mobile phones to a prisoner in 2012.
