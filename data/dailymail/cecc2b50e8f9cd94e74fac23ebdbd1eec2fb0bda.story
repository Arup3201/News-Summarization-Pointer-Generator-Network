Some people will try anything to avoid getting caught - but this woman went a step too far when she gave police her sister's name and faked a seizure in a bid to avoid jail for shoplifting.

Brittney Nicole Banta, was so determined not to go to prison that she gave her sister's name and birth date to police after being arrested for thieving from a Walmart store in Oklahoma.

The 24-year-old then feigned a seizure following her arrest in an attempt to get out of jail, according to Oklahoma Police.

Officers were called to Walmart in West Reno Avenue at about 2:30 p.m on Tuesday after a staff member reported that a woman had walked out of the store
with $35 of makeup without paying for it, according to the Oklahoman.

When police asked the woman for her ID, she gave them her sister's name and birth date instead of her own.

A Walmart worker gave officers her identification card, police said.

Banta told the officers she had given them her sister's name because there was a warrant for her arrest and she did not want to go to prison.

While in Oklahoma County Prison Banta pretended to have a seizure at the nurse's station in a bid to get out of jail, according to the police.
