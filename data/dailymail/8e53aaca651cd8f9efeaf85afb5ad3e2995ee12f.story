These photographs show the new mansion built by Chelsea star John Terry in the garden of his former home, which has finally been sold, it was revealed today.

Nestling behind a massive man-made lake, 
the new house dwarfs Terry’s old house, which he reportedly had to re-mortgage four times.

Three years after he first tried to sell the red-brick nine-bedroom Surrey mansion, it has been revealed that it has been sold for £5.25million.

Gone: Terry has finally sold the red-brick mansion for £5.25million after three years on the market

In 2010 the former England captain was advised to drop the asking price by three quarters of a million pounds.

However, helped by the current burgeoning property market, he has finally sold it for more than the £5million asking price.

The sale will help the 32-year-old finance the new mansion which he has had built in his back garden - a short drive from Chelsea's training ground in Cobham.

John and Toni Terry's new home has eight dressing and bathrooms and a private cinema and sauna

Constructed at the end of a private road, the huge new home, which he shares with wife Toni, is hidden away from prying eyes and is only clearly visible from the air.

It comprises eight dressing and bathrooms, nine bedrooms, a swimming pool and sauna.

The mansion even has its own private cinema and sauna. 

The huge lake in the garden has been constructed over three months and still needs laying to grass and paving.

Terry, a keen angler, was 
given permission to build the fishing lake in April 2012 - despite 
it being on green belt land.

Terry’s agent confirmed that the old home - which he bought in 2003 - had finally been sold.

The new buyers have not yet been identified.

'He always planned to sell it and is pleased to have made money on it,' said the agent.

Terry was reported to have incurred a mortgage debt of £4.6million pounds on the building of the new house.

Construction work started in December 2011 and the finished mansion is believed to include a 33x40ft indoor swimming pool, complete with a jacuzzi, steam room and changing facilities. 

Staff are also reportedly accommodated in one wing and there is also a visitor annexe in the opposite wing.

Terry's representative declined to comment on the new mansion.
