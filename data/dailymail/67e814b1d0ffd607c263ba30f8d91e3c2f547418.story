It might be one of the most prestigious events on the racing calendar but some of the arrivals at Cheltenham Festival today appeared to have dressed for the club rather than the parade ring.

Although rural staples such as tweed, fur and Hunter wellies were present and correct, other race goers opted to take advantage of the bright Gloucestershire sunshine and stepped out in wool mini skirts, worn with knee-length boots.

Print also proved a hit, with one brave lady choosing a cheerful ensemble comprised of a leopard print bag combined with a matching coat, boots and tights, while another opted for head-to-toe zebra print.

Popular choice: Blue has proved particularly popular among racegoers this year, with the colour appearing in a variety of shades

Elegant: One lady opted for a neutral ensemble topped with a pheasant feather hat, while another teamed her yellow skirt suit with purple tights

Others, however, chose to take a more traditional approach to racing get-ups and were well-wrapped up against the biting March breeze as they flocked into the racecourse for the first day of racing action.

Warm coats in an array of colourful hues proved particularly popular, with feather-festooned millinery used to ramp up the glamour along with opulent fur cuffs and collars.

Blue appears to be an early contender in the racing season style stakes, with scores of ladies opting for the colour in a whole range of shades, from cornflower to cobalt.

Whatever the colour, the vast majority appeared cheerful as they arrived to see the action on day one of what is one of the most prestigious events on the British racing calendar.

Joining them was the first royal guest of the season, Zara Tindall, who cut a glamorous figure in a dark blue wool coat created especially for the royal by designer Paul Costelloe, a matching hat and oversized sunglasses.

Tomorrow will see the 33-year-old joined at the Festival by her aunt, the Duchess of Cornwall, who has long been a racing enthusiast and is due to present a prize to the winner of the Queen Mother Champion Chase.

Despite the large royal contingent, the real highlight, on the track at least, is set to be Friday's Gold Cup, which will see veteran jockey AP McCoy make his final attempt at the classic race aboard Carlingford Lough.

McCoy also featured in the first day's racing at Cheltenham and piloted the hotly-tipped Jezki, a dark bay six-year-old gelding, in the Stan James Champion Hurdle this afternoon.

Unfortunately for McCoy, the race was taken by hot favourite Faugheen, with the Irish six-year-old battling home to give jockey Ruby Walsh his third winner of the day. 

Off the course, most of the entertainment came from Gloucestershire's increasingly fashionable style set, who had pulled out all the stops on a very sunny day one. 

With most eschewing skyscraper heels and flimsy dresses in favour of elegant wool coats and comfortable patent leather boots,  the race meeting is usually a masterclass in country chic, complete with lashings of tweed and even a flat cap or two.

Unlike Ascot - and from this year, Aintree - organisers at Cheltenham refuse to impose a dress code on guests and, beyond exhortations to wrap up warm and avoid anything that might offend, say anything goes - up to and including fancy dress.

While fancy dress does creep in on St Patrick's Thursday, Gloucestershire's most fashionable tend to opt for a glamorous take on rural, with oversized sunglasses, pearl necklaces and twinkling diamond stud earrings deployed to up the fashion ante.

Fur is a recurring motif, as are hats that take inspiration from rural life. Like the stylish effort unveiled by Zara Phillips on day one of the 2014 event, many come festooned with pheasant feathers while elegant blooms are a perennial favourite.

Male racegoers aren't immune from the pull of country style either, with most opting for tweed suits or chic red chinos teamed with a preppy navy blazer and artfully knotted tie.

All the trimmings: Fur and suede are perennial favourites when it comes to choosing a hat for Cheltenham

Wondering who to have a flutter on? Ladbrokes' Jessica Bridge reveals which horses are set to be first past the post at this week's Cheltenham Festival.

TODAY - CHAMPION HURDLE

HORSE: Faugheen

ODDS: 11/10

He's called Faugheen the machine for a reason and it's hard to see his unbeaten record coming undone on Tuesday, despite the impressive field.

Worth a flutter: Faugheen, pictured here on the gallops yesterday, is a popular choice among punters betting on the Champion Hurdle

Usual jockey, Ruby Walsh, is yet to decide his mount for the race, with stablemate and dual Champion Hurdle winner Hurricane Fly also lining up, but with fingers pointing towards Faugheen it's just another reason to back him.

WEDNESDAY - QUEEN MOTHER CHAMPION CHASE

HORSE: Dodging Bullets

ODDS: 4/1

All eyes might be on Sprinter Sacre and Sire de Grugy, but Dodging Bullets has easily had the most impressive route to this year's Festival, and although a short price the Clarence House Chase winner could and should serve up an upset to the front two in the betting.

THURSDAY: LADBROKES WORLD HURDLE

HORSE: Saphir du Rheu

ODDS: 9/2

Paul Nicholls' stranglehold at the top of the World Hurdle betting has tightened again following Rock on Ruby's withdrawal. It's going to be very hard to pick which of the stablemates will be sent off as favourite, but with Saphir Du Rheu back over hurdles it can only be a good thing.

Veteran: AP McCoy makes his way into the Cheltenham Festival for the very last time as a jockey

He gallops and jumps well, and his Cleeve Hurdle win shows he can do it at Cheltenham

FRIDAY - GOLD CUP

HORSE: Carlingford Lough

ODDS: 10/1

It's impossible to not back AP McCoy's last ever ride in the Gold Cup - it would be a fairytale end to a glittering career for the 20-time champion jockey.

There's still doubts whether favourite Silviniaco Conti can finally make it third time lucky at Cheltenham, but for the old romantics there's only one man that can win this year's Gold Cup, and it's AP McCoy.
