They say that diamonds are a girl's best friend.

And some lucky girls will never be short of friends thanks to another sparkling find by British miners Gem Diamonds Limited.

Supplying to prestigious clients such as Harry Winston - Marilyn Monroe's jeweller of choice - the diamond producer has dug up some of the largest most valuable gems in the world.

Gem Diamonds sold the 164 carat type IIa rough diamond 'of an exceptional quality' for £6m

In addition to the recovery of the 164 carat diamond, a 103 carat gem was also recovered from the Main pipe

In 2011 they uncovered the world's 14th biggest white diamond from their South African Letšeng mine - which they sold for £11million in the rough - and now, the same fruitful bit of land has sprouted another super gem.

The 164 carat beast was discovered on April 30 and has already been sold in the rough for £6million.

These diamonds and anything of their size are rare to recover, especially when they are of high first class quality.

Though the real test to find the gem's worth comes now as it's currently being computer analysed in Antwerp, Belgium, as experts look for flaws and weaknesses - but say it's value can only increase.

Large round cut diamonds are in high 
demand at the moment, so Gem might be hoping to find a part of the stone
 suitable for this purpose.

Gem tell the MailOnline that the manufacturing process is a complicated one to understand:

'The 164ct is an exceptional D colour, type IIa rough diamond with the potential to yield flawless polished diamonds. 

'The
 initial analysis, using Gem Diamonds' high tech computerised analytical
 capability in Antwerp (Baobab Technologies) revealed a number of 
potential polished options with respect to quantity, size, shape and 
clarity of the individual polished diamonds.

'Now that the diamond has been sold, it 
will be sent for closer examination, where windows (polished surfaces) 
are opened onto the stone to allow for greater accuracy in determining 
the most optimal polished value through the use of computer algorithms.

'While South African diamonds have in the past faced controversy over being a potential produce of conflict, Gem pride themselves in complying with the Kimberley Process'

'The most optimal solution from a 
valuation and marketing perspective will then be chosen and the stone 
will then be laser sawn into a number of pieces, shaped and then 
polished to deliver the potentially flawless polished diamonds.

'These
 large high value polished diamonds are eventually purchased by the 
highest end retail brands, such as Graff, Harry Winston and Moussaieff 
etc. and are set into unique pieces of jewellery for sale to their high 
net worth customers.'

While South African diamonds have in 
the past faced controversy over being a potential produce of conflict, 
Gem pride themselves in complying with the Kimberley Process established
 in 2003 to prevent conflict (blood) diamonds from entering the 
mainstream rough diamond market.

A spokesman said: 'Gem Diamonds continues to comply with Kimberley Process initiative.

'The
 Gem Diamonds Group is committed to the principles and practices of 
sustainable development and  believe an active and engaged approach to 
sustainability to be key to their ability to meet responsibilities to 
all stakeholders: shareholders, employees, communities and the 
environment.'

The diamond, recovered from the Main 
pipe at the Letšeng mine, is expected to produce top colour and top 
clarity polished diamonds and has been sold into a profit sharing 
arrangement for £6million (£37,000 per carat), whereby the rough 
price is received upfront.

Letšeng Diamonds will benefit further from a significant share of the downstream polished margin from the sale of the polished diamonds.

Further work focusing on reducing diamond damage at Letšeng continues and it is pleasing to report that in addition to the recovery of the 164 carat diamond, a 103 carat diamond was also recovered from the Main pipe during May 2013 and that both diamonds were undamaged.

The 103 carat diamond, which is not of the same high quality as the 164 carat diamond, will be sold on the next tender in June.

Gem Diamonds CEO, Clifford Elphick stated: 'The recovery and sale of this high quality 164 carat white diamond reinforces Letšeng's position as the premier source of exceptional diamonds.'

Gem Diamonds Limited is a UK Company listed on the London Stock Exchange with assets in Botswana and Lesotho.
