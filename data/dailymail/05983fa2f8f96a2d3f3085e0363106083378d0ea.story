A new batch of emails from Lois Lerner released by a congressional committee shed light on the former IRS official's attempts to do damage control as the Tea Party targeting scandal gained steam.

The emails show that Lerner tried to frame the harassment of certain non-profit groups as 'front line staff people using less than stellar judgement' to Treasury inspectors months before she acknowledged the mistake publicly. 

They also reveal that Lerner intended to apologize for those staff persons' inappropriate conduct during a speech at a conference in April of 2013, several weeks before she staged an apology during the question and answer portion of another conference, but that idea was ultimately nixed.

The emails were part of a document dump made by the Democratically-controlled Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations last week, headed by Sen. Carl Levin, as it released a report clearing the IRS and Lerner, who retired from her position overseeing the tax-exempt division of the IRS after being placed on leave in 2013, of politically motivated targeting.

Newly released emails from Lois Lerner show that the former IRS tax-exempt divisions head tried to convince Treasury inspectors that IRS employees in a Cincinnati office weren't scrutinizing conservative groups applying for non-profit tax statuses for political reasons

Republican members of the committee, led by Arizona Senator John McCain, released a report of their own on Friday that contradicts their colleagues and claims that conservative groups were less likely to receive tax-exempt status from the government agency that their liberal counterparts.

The Republican report is consistent with a May 2013 report released by the Treasury Inspector J. Russell George. 

Senate Democrats, who disagree with George's findings, attempted to set the record straight on Friday by releasing 1,706 pages of new documents relating to the so-called targeting of conservative groups in the 2010 and 2012 election cycle. 

The newly released emails offer a glimpse into Lerner's thinking on the targeting scandal. Lerner has refused to testify before Congress on the issue on the grounds that she would incriminate herself if she did while insisting that she did not instruct employees to break the law.

One email between a Treasury inspector involved in the investigation and Lerner from early 2013 show that the former IRS official tried to convince investigators that the actions of a Cincinnati division of the IRS only 'appeared to be politically motivated' but weren't.

'I am willing to take the blame for having not provided sufficient direction initially, which may have resulted in front line staff doing things that appeared to be politically motivated,' she told Treasury's Troy Paterson in a January 31 email, 'but I am not on board that anything occurred here shows that the IRS was politically motivated in the actions taken.' 

Lerner opined in the email that Treasury investigators were being 'too narrow in their view and have decided that because of the language used in our earlier [Be On The Lookout List] regarding Tea Party, everything that followed was tainted.'

She says the IRS already 'owned up' to the fact that the Cincinnati office was 'struggling' to determine which applications should be subject to additional reviews and had sent a team out to train them earlier that month.

Furthermore, Lerner states that Treasury officials expressed to her that her department's criteria for evaluating groups 'sounds reasonable.' However, 'they seem to be saying that reasonableness is overshadowed by the fact that the criteria look bad to folks on the outside, so there is no way we could cure the initial bad impression.'

'We understand why the criteria might raise questions,' she admitted but claimed that investigators could not provide her a 'clear definition of what they meant by targeting' and told her their investigation wasn't necessarily about political targeting.

She also claimed in the email that inspectors told her they weren't looking at whether groups affected were conservative or liberal 'because that is too difficult to figure out' and that organizations of both political persuasions appear to be on the list. 

Sen. Carl Levin, left, talks with Sen. John McCain, right, on Capitol Hill in April of 2013. After investigating the IRS for more than a year, the two Senators - one of whom is a Democrat, Levin, and and one of whom is a Republican, McCain - said on Friday they disagree on whether Lerner's division treated conservative groups worse than their liberal counterparts when they applied for tax-exempt status. McCain says it did

In an email exchange with other IRS officials on the day that the targeting story broke, Lerner maintained that liberal groups may have been singled out by her department for added scrutiny.

''I can't confirm that there was anyone on the other side of the political spectrum,' she said. 'I think that sentence presumes that we keep track of which side of the aisle an [organization] falls --we don't.

Lerner claimed the IRS only knows that certain organizations involved were conservative because they have been 'very loud in the press.'

'I think that line is dangerous,' she said, referring to IRS' admission that it selected more conservative groups for additional scrutiny than it did progressive groups.

In a follow-up email to her colleagues, Lerner warned them that it 'doesn't look good if it looks like we check to see what side of the aisle an org is on.' 

A series of emails in mid-April between Lerner and other IRS officials, including former acting IRS commissioner Steven Miller, who resigned after the scandal broke amid pressure from the White House and IRS chief of staff Nikole Flax, show that the IRS tried to get out in front of the brewing scandal by slipping an apology into remarks Lerner planned to give at a conference on April 25.

After Lerner suggested to Flax that she break the news in her speech, Flax brought the idea to Miller, who affirmed that the IRS 'may want to use it to burst a bubble.'

Flax agreed that it may not be 'a terrible idea' for her get their side of the story out and 'discuss the issue a bit.'

A draft of the speech contained in the set of documents released by the Senate subcommittee on investigations shows that Lerner planned to admit that the IRS' tax-exempt division was unprepared in 2010 to handle the influx all of the applications from organizations that may be engaging in political behavior.

Lerner planned to admit that her team 'placed too much reliance on the particular name of an organization' and specifically and specifically went after groups with the words 'tea party' and 'patriot' in the title.

'[L]et me be clear. The IRS should have done a better job of handling the review of the c4 applications,' she was supposed to say. 'We made mistakes for which we deeply apologize.

'But these mistakes were in no way due to any political or partisan reason.'

Lerner was to go on to say that missteps were made because of 'insufficient sensitivity to the implications of some of our decisions' and explain how the tax-exempt has amended its practices.

For undisclosed reasons, the section on the targeting and the Treasury inspector's related investigation never made it into Lerner's remarks as delivered that day. 

A few days later, the IRS began circulating talking points on the tax-exempt division's errant behavior, and on May 10 Lerner apologized during the question and answer portion of a speech before the American Bar Association.

She and the IRS have been the subject of congressional investigations ever since, including two ongoing reviews in the House of Representatives being conducted by the Ways and Means Committee and the Oversight Committee.

Republicans in the House are trying to determine if Lerner's division acted on its own or if coordinated with the White House. They are also trying to find out if the IRS attempted to engage in a cover up of the inappropriate activity before government investigators got involved.

The emails shed light on the thinking of the ex-IRS official - who has refused to testify before Congress

Lerner adamantly rejected the notion that conservative groups were targeting because of their political leanings

The emails also show that IRS discussed having Lerner fess up to the targeting scheme before it hit the press to 'burst a bubble bubble'
