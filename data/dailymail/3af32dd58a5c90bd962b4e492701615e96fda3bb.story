Cured: Dr Craig Spencer is said to be leaving New York's Bellevue Hospital Center tonight, 19 days after he was admitted for Ebola treatment

New York Ebola patient Dr Craig Spencer is heading home to see his girlfriend today after being cleared, but will not be able to have sex for three months because the virus can survive in semen.

Dr Spencer, 33, was isolated in Bellevue Hospital after reporting Ebola symptoms following his return from helping to treat the deadly infection in Guinea.

His case caused alarm after it emerged he had travelled around the city for six days, going bowling, dining out and using an Uber cab, before being diagnosed. 

Following round the clock treatment for 19 days, sources tell the New York Times Dr Spencer has been given the all-clear to go home to his fiancee Morgan Dixon, who is quarantined in their Harlem apartment.

Miss Dixon will have to remain in the house for the next four days, as she is still considered an infection risk.

Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency physician from Lenox Hill Hospital, told the New York Daily News: 'Once he's had Ebola, he develops antibodies (that are) protective to him. 

'He won't get Ebola again. Since he's not having fever or active symptoms, he's not at risk to the community.

'The virus lives in semen for up to 3 months, so he should not engage in sexual intercourse (for that time).'

Mayor Bill de Blasio said he will shake Dr Spencer's hand after he is released, calling him a hero, and adding that his is the last known case of Ebola in the U.S.

Seven of the eight cases of Ebola cured on American soil have all been treated within 22 days - and the eighth patient was released within 40 days.

Dr Spencer's condition was upgraded from serious to stable after he received a blood transfusion from fellow US Ebola survivor Nancy Writebol, a missionary who contracted the disease in Liberia.

The method was also used to treat Dallas nurses Amber Vinson and Nina Pham, NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo, Dr Nancy Writebol and Dr Rick Sacra.

Holed up in Bellevue, in New York City's Murray Hill area, Dr Spencer has been playing the banjo and practicing yoga, it emerged last week. 

On Wednesday, the doctor requested that someone bring him his banjo from his apartment so he could pass the time in quarantine playing music.

Spencer was also reportedly keeping in shape by riding a stationary bicycle in his hospital room.

Another source told the New York Post he has been playing David Bowie and Interpol songs all day long, which has earned him the reputation as a 'total hipster' among hospital staff, some of whom were not impressed by his taste in music.

‘He is an avid little banjo player and he’s self-taught,’ Chriselle Gardner, the mother of Spencer’s fiancee Morgan Dixon, told the Post. ‘I can tell you, he’s keeping his doctors amused.’

Dixon has been in quarantine at their apartment since October 25. She will be able to leave their home for the first time since Craig’s diagnosis on November 14.

New York City health officials also announced Wednesday that a person who had been in contact with Dr Spencer is being released from mandatory quarantine, but will be subject to daily evaluations by a doctor, reported CBS New York.

The HHC emphasized that the person in question does not show any Ebola symptoms and does not pose any health risk to the general public.

City officials revealed Wednesday that a total of 357 people were being actively monitored for signs of Ebola as a precaution, among them travelers from West Africa and Bellevue staff caring for Dr Spencer.
