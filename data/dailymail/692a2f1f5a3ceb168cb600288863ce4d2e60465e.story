The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency asked its employees in Denver this year to stop leaving a dangerous pollutant – human feces – in office hallways, according to a report that circulated on Wednesday.

Managers in the EPA's Region 8 office in Denver, Colorado 
emailed their entire staff to plead a cease-and-desist case for whoever had been pooping and fleeing.

Government 
Executive reported that EPA Deputy Regional Administrator Howard Cantor addressed 'several incidents' in the office building at 1595 Wynkoop Street in Denver.

Employees, he wrote, had been clogging toilets with
 paper towels. And there was 'an individual placing feces in the hallway' outside a restroom.

Dirty job: Someone at the EPA had to pick up human feces that an employee left in the hallway of the agency's Denver office building

It's unclear whether EPA regulations leave room for the 'If you gotta go, you gotta go' rule, but the government green group shouldn't have problems cleaning up its mess.

Last summer the agency awarded an $80,000 contract to TDA Research, Inc. 'to develop technologies to protect public health and the environment following potential accidents or intentional attacks involving chemical and biological agents.'

The technology, the agency reported, 'involves applying an impermeable polymer material to create a barrier on contaminated wastes removed from response sites following chemical or biological incidents, including building materials, furniture, insulation, and other materials.'

'The successful encapsulation of chemicals and biological agents would protect responders and the general public from exposure and expedite the safe removal of wastes.'

Region 8 serves Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming and 27 Tribal Nations, but only Denver seems to be afflicted with random pooping disease.

Government Executive reported Eric Katz declined to share a copy of the EPA memo.

'Sorry ... can't share that,' he emailed MailOnline. 'Feel free to link to my story though. Thanks.'

Katz reported that Cantor wrote: 'Management is taking this situation very
 seriously and will take whatever actions are necessary to identify and 
prosecute these individuals.',

The EPA official also asked employees to root out the poop bandit and turn him or her in.

The Environmental Protection Agency funds hundreds thousands of studies each year into the harmful effects of volatile chemical compounds, so it should seem logical that Cantor consulted with John Nicoletti, a 'national expert' in workplace violence, to quantify the health risks.

Feces left in areas where people walk is 'very dangerous' and a genuine health and safety risk, Nicoletti helpfully concluded, adding that whoever dropped the deuce would 'probably escalate' his or her behavior to something even more dastardly.

No kidding: The EPA hired a workplace consultant to confirm that pooping anyplace other than here can be dangerous to human health

EPA spokesman Richard Mylott told Government Executive that its 'actions in response to recent workplace issues have been deliberate and have focused on ensuring a safe work environment for our employees.'

The agency has been troubled in recent months with revelations of wrongdoing by its employees that pushed the bounds of believability.

One employee whose work formed the cornerstone of the EPA's global-warming-control measures was jailed in December for defrauding the agency out of $900K by never showing up to work – claiming he was an undercover CIA agent

Another confessed to spending between two and six hours per day viewing pornography on his government-issued computer during work hours.

Still others were found to be using government credit cards for gym memberships, gift cards, meals and even charity donations.
