No longer content with cute cat cafes, Londoners are now lining up to visit the capital's first ever Owl Bar - where visitors can admire a selection of feathery critters over a cocktail.

Based on Tokyo's Owl cafe trend, the pop-up bar, Annie the Owl, will open in Soho from March 19 to 25, and nearly 25,000 bird fans have already applied for the £20 tickets. Opening hours will be from 8pm to 2pm to respect the owl's - and the punters' - nocturnal habits, and profits will go to the Barn Owl Trust.

But a Change.org petition railing against the pop-up has already been signed by over 2,000 animal lovers. And animal rights activitsts PETA, told Mail Online Travel: 'It would be hard to think of a more frightening experience for owls, who have especially acute hearing and vision, than to be surrounded by intoxicated, caterwauling humans at a bar.'

Annie the Owl Curator Sam Sheiky told London Evening Standard: 'It is for a good cause and Londoners will have fun. We have spent lots of time taking care of animal welfare and making sure the owls will be comfortable.'

'The notion of raising money to protect owls in nature by terrifying owls in captivity is absurd. 

'The kindest place for owl enthusiasts to admire these birds is in their natural environment, not at a London nightspot where they're used as props or playthings.'

Animal cafes are indeed a growing trend. Hot on its tail, is London's first dog cafe, the Happiness of Hounds, due to open in Shoreditch later this year.

The capital's original cat cafe, Lady Dinah's Cat Emporium, a home for rescued cats, has been welcoming hordes of moggie fans since last year. 

Cat cafes are hugely popular in Asia - there are 100 in Tokyo alone
Establishments are like normal cafes - serving sandwiches and coffee - but are full of cats that roam freely

Marketing itself to the many people in the city who live in small flats and who are unable to keep pets, but want a little bit of relaxing animal attention. 

'Our greatest and most important duty is to ensure the happiness and well-being of London’s most loved felines' says its website. 

The cafe's owners say the venue is designed with 'the emotional and physical needs of our resident rescue cats in mind and we do our utmost to give them the time, space and resources they need to form a harmonious household.'

Growing trend:  New York's pop-up Cat Cafe by Purina One, which opened last April

At Café Little Zoo in Narashino, just outside Tokyo, owners have taken the animal cafe trend to extremes. 

Visitors can meet iguanas, falcons and even snakes over a coffee a cake.

In Japan, cat cafes are old hat, with eateries and bars now offering the chance for visitors to get up close to dogs, goats, rabbits and even penguins and snakes. 

But Mimi Bekhechi, UK Director of PETA suggests that animal lovers should avoid these types of cafe, where animals may be distressed or maltreated.

'Animals and clubs or cafés don't mix,' she told Mail Online Travel

'The loud music and bright lights at nightclubs are extremely stressful to animals. 

'Most wild animals hired for tacky PR stunts are carted from venue to venue and live in small cages for the majority of their days. 

'They are often victims of harsh, abusive training methods, and when they are no longer useful or get too big, many of them end up abandoned or sold to the highest bidder. It adds nothing to a night out to gawk at terrified animals, but for the animals, it's a living nightmare.
