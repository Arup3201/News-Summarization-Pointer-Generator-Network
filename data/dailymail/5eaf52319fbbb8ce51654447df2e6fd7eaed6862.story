Nothing is more certain in this season of twists and turns, shocks and surprises than that Manchester City will go all out to beat West Ham on Sunday rather than play for the home draw which would  deliver unto them, for the second time in three years, the Premier League title.

Manuel Pellegrini’s effervescent team go into the last day fined a fortune for breaking financial fair play regulations and under fire for occupying the top position in the table for no more than a couple of weekends since August.

So the question is: do they deserve the championship of England?

Going all the way to the top: Manchester City are destined to end their goal-laden season with the title

Let’s see if those aristocratic neighbours at Old Trafford can give us an honest answer. I suspect they will, if the question is put in its proper context.

Being knocked off their perch was always going to be painful for United. That City, again, should profit from that fall from grace makes it torture.

But nothing will injure the red faithful more than the manner in which they have lost and City have won the title.

The agonising truth is that City that have claimed the crown by playing the thrill-factor football with which Sir Alex Ferguson’s swashbuckling Manchester United teams used to exercise their swaggering domination over our national game.

That this should happen at the same time as United were retreating into the cautious, defensive shell constructed by Fergie’s chosen replacement makes it all the more unbearable for them.

David Moyes is not the first to be overwhelmed by the romantic expectations at Old Trafford. It wasn’t easy to follow Sir Matt Busby, either.

It does not make him a bad manager but he was the bringer of a sad reality.

Losing to City is one thing. Being out-thrilled by them is something more chastening altogether and if their hands were not so heavily on heart United’s fans should be applauding their cross-town rivals.

Never mind being 20 points behind in a race they won by 11 last May, feel the hurt of the goal difference.

City are plus 63, having scored a hundred. United are 42 back, having netted a mere 63 times.

Strewth, even while going for goal the Etihad boys are still the better defenders.

I am not a believer that statistics tell the whole story but there is no getting round these numbers. Less so when you watch City play.

Pellegrini always believe his expensive – in the eyes of UEFA over-expensive – ensemble will outscore the opposition. Moyes, trapped in his pressurised bunker, barely trusted the heirs to the Fergie legacy to cross the half-way.

Thrill factor: Yaya Toure's goal against Aston Villa typifies City's effervescence this season

Belief: Manuel Pellegrini (centre) always backs his expensively-assembled side to outscore the opposition

Swashbuckling: Sir Alex Ferguson's teams used to win trophies with style

Not everyone approves of Arab owners pouring their oil wealth into a Manchester suburb. But at a time when United were flagging as the standard bearers, there can be no logical denying that the Premier League needed a team to step up and entertain the masses.

It rubs salt into the Old Trafford wound that Liverpool have been the next best to City when it came to meeting that challenge and all credit to Brendan Rodgers for stimulating that revival on the Mersey.

But while a Kop championship would have provided the emotional climax to this Hillsborough anniversary year, it is City’s football which has roused the blood of football lovers everywhere.

One glance at the mediocrity below the elite clubs serves as a reminder of the importance of City’s contribution to the spectacle.

West Bromwich go into this last weekend on a paltry 36 points. Four more clubs just above them – Hull, Aston Villa, Sunderland and Swansea – all have less than the 40 points which used to be the cut line. Wretchedly as United are struggling home in seventh, the rest are at least eight points in arrears of them.

City, with some help from Liverpool, have diverted attention from that erosion of standards from the bottom of league, let alone being over-priced, is over-hyped as allegedly the best in the world.

Even for United fans, it is time to own up and give City the respect they deserve.

Style council: This Robin van Persie volley exemplified the verve with which Ferguson's teams played

Is that it, Mr Dyke? Is this really all the new FA chairman’s master plan for breeding generations of English world beaters?

This is the half-baked mish-mash just dished up for the future of our game:

A few B teams from the Premier League giants playing down in a nether-world somewhere between League Two and the Conference, some of whose clubs will make up the numbers.

The likes of Liverpool, United, Arsenal and City fostering nursery clubs lower down those divisions.

A trimming of imports so that 90 home-grown footballers play half any club’s Premier League games in a season, instead of 66 at present.

Some revolution.

One in the eye for common sense: Greg Dyke's FA Commission report is hardly revolutionary

How, exactly, is playing in a new League Three against part-timers and fellow reserves going to prepare the finest English youngsters to take on Germany, Brazil et al in Russia 2014?

Nor will they be allowed promotion above League One If it is to work, as it does in Spain, the B teams must compete in the Championship – and, by the way, not be forbidden to take part in the FA Cup.

Nursery clubs? Most of the big teams already have them, de facto, in the more challenging and educational first divisions on the Continent.

An increase of 24 more home boys getting a few more games in the Premier League? Wow. I’m not great at maths but unless I’m mistaken that adds down to all of 1.2 players per each of the 20 clubs.

You had to worry about this commission when you saw who the chairman is. Now Dyke has discovered first hand who really runs the national game. It’s not his FA. It’s the big clubs.

The waste bin beckons.

Of course Louis van Gaal is coming to Manchester United once Holland’s World Cup campaign in Brazil is over.

Whether he is the right man for the job remains to be seen. By his own admission he is an iron-fisted tyrant. By our observation his teams play with flair and style when things go well but he can revert to the suffocatingly pragmatic if the going gets tough.

But one thing he must not do is allow to fall into rusting neglect the pipe-line through which United have always brought fine young players and continue to do so.

The future's bright: James Wilson scores against Hull and United must remember their traditions and nurture him, Tom Lawrence (below left) and Adnan Januzaj (below right)

James Wilson, 18, scored twice in this week’s 3-1 win over Hull as he led an attack which included 19-year-old Adnan Januzaj and Tom Lawrence, 20.

Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes, as stand-in manager and temporary coach respectively, are still at Old Trafford as reminders of how well this youth policy has served the club down the years.

Thus have United have helped not only themselves but England, and other nations.

That trust is about to be place in Van Gaal’s hands. Let him not betray it.

A quiet word in the quivering ears of Messrs Suarez, Terry and Gerrard, among others, before we drown in their tears.

Football is supposed to be a man’s game and never forget it is only a game.

Not the crying game.
