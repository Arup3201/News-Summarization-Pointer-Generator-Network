I think Arsenal now have to do some business with Giroud’s injury and Manchester United have to perform some serious surgery on that team. You always look to make one or two changes but they are in need of quite a few players. Sam Allardyce is talking about new signings at West Ham and you wonder if Neil Warnock will do something at Crystal Palace because they need to get cracking. But Tony Pulis left as a result of their transfer policy so it will be interesting to see what happens here. But you have to invest to stay in this league and every manager will probably still be hoping to squeeze in a few more deals between now and Monday.

I think it was a good signing and I think there was a real momentum at Anfield last year with the emotion and belief they had. Just when they might have been looking at their signings and thinking 'is there one that will catch the imagination', this transfer certainly does. He wasn’t quite so good at the World Cup but he is clearly a very dangerous. Coming back to England he’ll be able to live very close to where he did before and I think he is adored by the fans over here.

Before the season started it was probably Alexis Sanchez, but he has not started the season on fire. But in terms of starting well, I think Gylfi Sigurdsson has slotted back in seamlessly at Swansea and he’s a better player than a lot of people give him credit for. He’s started well and that was good business by Swansea. Then I think few people could have had such a promising start as Calum Chambers. He went from playing at right back to Southampton, to centre back at Arsenal and now a call-up for the full England squad. It’s always hard to tell at these early stages but those two have impressed me.

Well you talk about goalkeepers becoming a third centre half these days to play out from the back – I guess he took it to the next level! Goalkeepers are becoming more technically gifted so who knows what will happen in future. I never actually ended up in goal but there’s always some player who fancies himself as a goalkeeper. In training we’d play a lot of small-sided games so one goalkeeper would be there and then a player might join in, but these days that’s rare with so many top goalkeepers in squads. The odd player might go in goal for shooting practice – they always enjoy diving and think they can do better than the keeper!

I played against Grobbelaar and he was lovely off the field – he was nothing like what you saw on it. He used to give plenty to his defenders if he thought they were at fault but he was a real character and you have to admire goalkeepers who try something a little bit different to put the opposition off.

You always see something like that as a great challenge. You would welcome him to the Premier League and I'd certainly let him know that even if I was playing for an unfashionable club and was a lesser known player, he'd certainly know about me by the end of 90 minutes! What it does do is make you play at your absolute best. He will raise the quality of those around him in his team but as the opposition you try a bit harder and you're more conscious of getting tight to him, even if that means getting quite physical. I'd be getting the first chance to impact on him so I don't want this to be a game thinking he's done especially well on his debut!

I think a lot of the criticism of Sir Alex Ferguson has been harsh. He brought such success to the club and also brought in players who he thought would succeed right until the end. Even when he bought Robin van Persie and people suspected it might be the end, he won the league. But when you look at the likes of Smalling and Jones, I don't think they were quite nurtured in the same way as Vidic and Ferdinand were. Those two are now almost a problem for the club because they haven’t trained on and done as well as expected – if they had you would say it's good management by Ferguson. But they have not developed. I do think the one area where Ferguson was guilty of not securing the future was in midfield. He relied so heavily on Paul Scholes and maybe he should have got the cheque book out sooner.

I certainly think he can be. He brings a different set of problems for the opposition to cope with. He's got phenomenal pace. I don't think I've ever seen anyone with the same tenacity to win the ball back for his team. That work rate he has, you see more of that in central positions than out wide. When he gets the ball and links with team-mates, sometimes he needs to slow things down a bit and think things through. When you look at someone like Thierry Henry, he wasn't involved as often, but he picked and chose his moments to make a telling contribution. I think that's what Sanchez has to do if he plays through the middle. But the fans love him because of his willingness to run and to take on much bigger men – you can't bully him.

Really good question! Looking at the players there is such an uncertainty in their play. If you're on the training pitch every day and there is only one lone voice talking you through the system, you don’t really take ownership of it. Certainly out of position they don't seem to know where they are supposed to be on the pitch and it looks like there’s almost an information overload. Sometimes the players need to make the decisions for themselves, but playing that system is not coming naturally to them. The overall philosophy and method of learning is not working, but they have bought a new defender in Marcos Rojo so I think they will be looking at a central midfielder. But you can't keep buying your way out of trouble and maybe even Rooney can come into midfield as a creative option. But with Javier Hernandez losing his golden touch and Danny Welbeck being told he can go, they might also need a striker with genuine pace at this rate!

One hundred per cent no! But it does show you if you don't know where to be on a pitch, it doesn't matter how quick or mobile you are, you're not going to make it. I have some sympathy with Chris Smalling and Phil Jones who have been moved from pillar to post at United and they don’t look like serious first team contenders. I might know where to be at the pitch and be able to read the game, but I'm not sure I'd have the athleticism to cope! 

Roy has clearly had so few options that he's had to turn to the youth. I'm pleased to see Andros Townsend back but it seesm that if you are in the team for a top four team - like Calum Chambers - you get straight in the England squad. It might be early for him to get in there but when you look at the other options, there aren't many! Roy is probably looking at players who have a good chance of featuring over the next two years. It's very early in their club careers for the likes of Chambers and John Stones but there are not many players out there and they will be a part of England's future. I think Chambers or Stones could even end up playing at right back as utility men, which is indicative of where we are but I was surprised than Nathaniel Clyne did not make it in there. Roy also has to look at some new candidates in midfield. Maybe it's time for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to claim that central position he covets or maybe James Milner would be a safe pair of hands in there.

I think it has to be one of the proudest moments of any Englishman's career, both for him and his whole family. He was the obvious candidate among an inexperienced squad - you've lost three players with more than 100 caps in the last 12 months. I haven't been in his compnay behind the scenes but I think he's a very visual captain leading by example but he has to be wary overdoing that. He will need help from both Louis van Gaal at Manchester United and Roy Hodgson in dealing with that. He's certainly maturing with his discipline but you don't want to take anything away from his game and he needs to find that balance and I'm sure he can do it.

They're good players but I think the question is where do they play? Everton are very settled as a team. Maybe if they had made the Champions League Kagawa might have been a good option, particularly with Ross Barkley out. But I'm not sure about Holtby, I don't think he's progressed as he migth have liked. Both have also suffered a loss of form, so I don't know. I thought I'd see more from Kagawa at the World Cup but he seems to have gone backwards as a player.
