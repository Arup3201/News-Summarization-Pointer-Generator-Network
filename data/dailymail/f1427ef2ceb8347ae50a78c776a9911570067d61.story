Theo Walcott has had a year to forget but he finally had something to celebrate in 2014 when his father was married at the weekend.

Walcott posted pictures on his Instagram page of him and his brother at his dad Don's nuptials.

The 25-year-old forward said: 'What an amazing day!!! Congrats to my Dad & Gail on becoming #Husband & #Wife.'

Walcott endured a difficult last season for both Arsenal and England as a cruciate ligamet injury curtailed his involvement in both his club's FA Cup success and his country's ill-fated World Cup.

Manager Arsene Wenger recently confirmed the England forward will miss the start of the season through injury but should be back in training by the end of August.

Arsenal got their pre-season underway on Saturday in their traditional friendly against Borehamwood.

Goals from Kristoffer Olsson and Benik Afobe were enough to give an under-strength Gunners side a comfortable 2-0 victory against the Conference South side.
