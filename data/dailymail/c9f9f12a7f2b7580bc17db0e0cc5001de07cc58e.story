He may be renowned for masterpieces such as the 
Mona Lisa and the Last Supper, but Leonardo da Vinci is also one of the greatest anatomists the world has seen.

His intricate knowledge of the human body, which was years ahead of his time, is demonstrated in a collection of notebooks which he filled with detailed studies of organs, bones, vessels and muscles using new illustrative techniques.

The collection of notebooks, which date between 1452 and 1519, and chart much of the Italian renaissance artist's  groundbreaking studies of the human body.

Detailed: Da Vinci's sketches of muscles and skeletons foreshadow modern techniques, such as MRI scans and 3D computer modelling, to 'an astonishing degree'

Talented: Leonardo da Vinci is still considered to be one of the greatest anatomists the world has ever seen

Comparison: Leonardo da Vinci's anatomical 
drawing of a hand is remarkably similar to modern medical scans and 
models which show just how true to life the 
artist's work was

Almost 500 years after his death, the drawings in his anatomical notebooks are being displayed at an exhibition in Ediburgh alongside 21st-century pictures of the same body parts - with da Vinci's sketches proving startlingly accurate.

The exhibition entitled Leonardo da Vinci: The Mechanics of 
Man is being held at The Queen's Gallery, Palace of Holyroodhouse, Edinburgh, and runs from 
August 2 to November 10.

Curators say his work foreshadows modern techniques like MRI scans and 3D computer modelling 'to an astonishing degree'.

Da Vinci began researching the human body to ensure his paintings were as true to nature as possible. Between 1507 and 1513 he dissected more than 30 human corpses, including that of a 100-year-old man.

The polymath was able to use his skills in art, architecture and engineering to produce images of the body never seen before.

Exhibition curator Martin Clayton, of Royal Collection Trust, said: 'This is the first time that Leonardo da Vinci's anatomical drawings have been displayed alongside their modern-day counterparts.

'It's incredibly exciting to discover how Leonardo's investigations 500 years ago foreshadowed the work of today's leading anatomists to an astonishing degree.'

Dedicated: Da Vinci dissected more than 30 human corpses to learn about the human anatomy so his paintings and sculptures would be as realistic and accurate as possible

work kept by the Royal Collection Trust show just how far-sighted 
da Vinci’s work was

Peter Abrahams, professor of clinical anatomy at Warwick Medical School, who helped the show's curators, said: 'In many ways Leonardo predicted the 20th-century revolution in various medical imaging techniques.

'His use of cross sections and slices to show deep internal structures within the body foreshadowed the modern techniques of CT and MRI scanning.

'The anatomical accuracy of Leonardo's drawings has rarely ever been surpassed, and I still use them to teach surgeons and medical students today.'

Leonardo da Vinci is best known for his stunning artwork but the Italian Renaissance painter had many talents.

He was also a sculptor, architect, musician, mathematician, engineer, inventor, anatomist, geologist, cartographer, botanist, and writer.

The Mona Lisa is his most famous and most parodied portrait while his painting of The Last Supper is the most reproduced religious painting of all time.

Leonardo's drawing of the Vitruvian Man is also regarded as a cultural icon - being reproduced on items as varied as the euro coin, textbooks, and T-shirts.

Only around fifteen of his paintings survive because of his constant, and frequently disastrous, experimentation with new techniques, and his chronic procrastination.

Leonardo is also revered for his technological ingenuity.

He conceptualised a helicopter, a tank, concentrated solar power, a calculator, and the double hull, also outlining a rudimentary theory of plate tectonics.

Relatively few of his designs were constructed or were even feasible during his lifetime, but some of his smaller inventions, such as an automated bobbin winder and a machine for testing the tensile strength of wire, entered the world of manufacturing unheralded.

He made important discoveries in anatomy, civil engineering, optics, and hydrodynamics, but he did not publish his findings and they had no direct influence on later science.
