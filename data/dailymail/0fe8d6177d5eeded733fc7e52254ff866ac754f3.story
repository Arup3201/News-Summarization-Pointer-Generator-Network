Keith Vaz said Britain's immigration system had entered 'intensive care'

A backlog of more than 390,000 immigration cases has been built up by the Home Office – equivalent to the population of Cardiff.

The figure is revealed in a report from MPs that describes Britain’s immigration system as being in ‘intensive care’.

Earlier this week, chief inspector of immigration John Vine said that the number of missing migrants in the UK was 89,000.

But the Home Affairs Select Committee said there were a further 304,222 files piled up elsewhere in the system – including asylum seekers and foreign criminals. 

Chairman Keith Vaz said: ‘This brings the total number of unresolved immigration cases to 393,222, which is more than the population of Cardiff.’

The revelation comes as separate figures show a record 3,000 immigrants a month being caught trying to sneak into the country illegally. 

The Home Office disclosed that 11,920 entry attempts were detected at Calais and British ports in April to July of this year alone – equivalent to almost 100 a day.

And last night it emerged that rather than deporting the stowaways back to their home countries, France is simply releasing them to make new attempts at breaching Britain’s borders.

On the backlog, Labour MP Mr Vaz added: ‘Our immigration system has left A&E and has entered intensive care.’

In its latest report on the work of the Home Office’s immigration directorates, the committee also hit out at the Government’s use of a single immigration target to reduce net migration to less than 100,000.

The target – which the Government now has no chance of achieving, with net migration running at 260,000 – is labelled ‘too blunt’ and ‘arbitrary’.

The report states: ‘An arbitrary target set by ministers, however well-intentioned, only serves to reduce public confidence in the ability of any government to deliver a future pledge on immigration.’ The MPs also hit out at the Home Office and Theresa May for sitting on Mr Vine’s reports.

A string of explosive investigations by the inspector have been delayed for months. Ministers have been accused of slipping them out on busy days in order to try to bury bad news.

The committee said: ‘It is unacceptable for the Home Office to withhold from public view reports produced by the independent chief inspector of immigration and borders for longer than one month without providing a good reason.’

The Home Office was facing accusations of pandering to political correctness after saying foreigners sneaking into Britain should not be referred to as illegal immigrants. Instead they should be called ‘clandestine entrants’.

The term emerged after borders chief John Vine described them as ‘irregular migrants’ in an interview on Radio 4’s Today programme.

Referring to inspection reports on the immigration system, he said: ‘These people … very often succeed in getting into the UK as irregular migrants, the authorities in Britain have no record of who they are.’

The Home Office later said the preferred term was ‘clandestine entrants’.

A spokesman said: ‘If you say “illegal immigrants” there is a presumption and connotations that they have done something wrong. There are other reasons people come to this country by illegal methods, for instance because they are trafficked or organised crime groups.’
