Michael A. Brown, 31, is accused of posing as a podiatry student and 'sucking on a woman's toes'

A registered sex offender was arrested on Monday at a Walmart in North Carolina for allegedly sucking on a woman's toes while posing as a podiatry student.

Michael Brown, 31, was taken into custody on Thursday night and charged with a misdemeanor assault on a female after police recognized him in surveillance photos of a man leaving a Walmart store on North Generals Boulevard.

Brown approached Erika Porras, 40, who was shopping in the Walmart on Monday with her daughter Kattie.

Brown, who has a foot fetish, told Porras he was a podiatry student and asked her if he could do 'research' by accompanying her while she tried on shoes.

He said, ‘Follow me to the shoe department,’ and Porras, who thought he worked at the store, obeyed.

Erika's daughter Kattie told WCNC that he said, ‘I need to take a picture for research,’ and when he did, he stuck her foot in his mouth.'

Brown realized that Porras was upset with his lewd behavior and apologized, even offering to buy her groceries for her.

‘Sorry ma’am. Please, please, please,' he allegedly said as he begged for her mercy.

Porras was outraged and called the police who later recognized Brown in a surveillance photo and captured him at his home in Concord.

Detective Dennis Harris told WCNC he's never seen anything like this. 'Kind of bizarre, strange,' he said.

NBC Charlotte spoke with Porras who broke into tears after seeing a surveillance photo of Brown.

'Oh yeah. Yeah, that’s him,' she said.

Brown has terrorized more than one woman and is a registered sex offender who was arrested in 2001 when he was 17 for breaking into a woman's home in Concord and sucking her toes. He's thought to have assaulted even more than two women for his sick pleasure.
