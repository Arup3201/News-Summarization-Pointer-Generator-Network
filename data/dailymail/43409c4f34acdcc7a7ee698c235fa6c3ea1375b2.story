Mexican police found themselves locked in a tense shoot-out to save a police commander and his family who had been kidnapped.

An officer was injured during the gun battle after officers forced the kidnappers - two who are believed to be former police officers - to stop the van they were using to hold the police chief and his family in Mexico City.

Bullets flew across the ground as the kidnappers fired at police, but officers managed to arrest all four kidnappers involved.

Mexican police were involved in a tense shoot-out with kidnappers in Mexico City who had tried to take the police chief and his family in a van and then fled the vehicle, shooting a semi-automatic rifle at officers 

They said they acted quickly after receiving a tip-off about a plan to kidnap the police chief. 

Video footage of the shoot-out was captured on camera as a van, apparently containing the police chief and his family, was chased throughout the Mexican capital and stopped by officers on motorbikes in Gustavo A. Madero Street.  

The kidnappers jumped out of the van to escape and flee, firing as they ran. 

During the battle a police man is seen falling to the ground injured as bullets fly through the air, creating clouds of dust.

As more police arrived to stop the attackers they were involved in a shoot-out and an officer was injured 

Despite the use of guns by the group police managed to arrest all four attackers, who are now in custody

According to official sources, Garcia and Montes were former police officers.

Police spokesman Cencio Corrales Rico said: 'We had a tip-off that the police chief might be targeted because certain criminals were unhappy about an investigation into the robbery of an armoured car that had resulted in several arrests.

'As a result we had security at his home able to act quickly when the kidnapping took place.'
