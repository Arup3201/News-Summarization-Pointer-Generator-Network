Mandy Williams has become a grandmother for the first time twice in the same day after her son and daughter had children in the same hospital ward

A woman has become a grandmother for the first time twice in the same day  - as both her son and daughter had children in the same hospital ward.

Despite being due weeks apart cousins Mabli Elin Stokes and Hallie Rose Jones defied the odds to be born within hours - and yards - of each other at Wrexham Maelor hospital.

Grandmother Mandy Williams said it was fantastic that the family were 'all together on the ward' when her daughter Hannah Jones, 24, and son Daniel's partner Jade Fraser went into labour at the same time.

Mrs Williams, 45, said: 'I became a grandmother to two grandchildren on the same day.

'The odds against this, I have been told by the Wrexham Maelor Hospital, were extremely high.

'When we were all on the labour ward at the same time it was fantastic.

'I was so excited to become a nana but two on the same day was amazing.'

Hannah Jones, 24, had Mabli with partner Iestyn Stokes, 20.

The couple live in Smithfield, Wrexham, just down the road from Mandy in Hightown.

Social worker Hannah said: 'She’s over the moon, I think she’s even more happy that they came out on the same day.'

She said her baby Mabli was two days late, due on November 14.

But her brother Daniel’s baby was born two weeks early - Daniel, 22, and his partner Jade Fraser, 21, of Llay, were expecting Hallie on December 2.

Miss Fraser had to be induced when her waters broke early.

Hannah said: 'My baby came out at 11.06am and my brother had his at 4.48pm, five hours apart.

'It was strange, but it was really nice at the same time. Daniel and Jade were literally in the room across from us.

'It made both of us feel a lot better going through the same thing together.

'Normally, the hospital only allows two to a room, but because we were all there they let Daniel come across and see his niece when she was born.'

Having just given birth, Hannah was also able to go across the corridor and see her newborn niece Hallie just hours later.

Hannah added: 'One of the midwives had worked there for 26 years and she’d never known anything like it.

'She said sometimes twins come out further apart than that.

'They will have the same birthday - they can have parties together and everything.'

Mrs
Williams said is looking forward to having her first picture with her 
two grandchildren in each arm when the family get back together this 
weekend.

She added: 'I
am now looking forward to Christmas with two gorgeous grandchildren and
have many joint birthday parties to look forward to.'
