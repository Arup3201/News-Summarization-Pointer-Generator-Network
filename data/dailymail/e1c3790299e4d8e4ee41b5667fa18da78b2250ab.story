With a perilous runway that jut out into the sea, and a descent through skyscrapers and craggy mountains, Kai Tak airport in Hong Kong was seen as the ultimate test of a pilot's skills.

The airport- which was shut down in 1998- was the site of botched landings that included planes crashing into the water and pilots aborting landings when conditions were poor.

These spectacular images show the moment experienced pilots grappled with the notoriously dangerous landing, before the airport was closed by the government in 1998.

Fasten your seat belts: The images show just how perilous the Kai Tak flight path and landing was. An aircraft flies through high-rise buildings as it prepares for landing

Spectacular: The small airport became dangerously overcrowded in the 90s. Its beautiful surroundings belie the danger involved in landing a plane here

Washed up: A jumbo-jet crashes into the water when landing at Kai Tak Airport, Hong Kong. Planes would sometimes overrun the landing strip and plunge into the sea

Landing: This aircraft makes a low-descent over rooftops- from this angle it looks like it skims the top of a TV aerial

Dramatic:  A jumbo-jet from Kai Tak Airport takes the notoriously challenging 'Hong Kong' turn which is taken after the aircraft flies over a marker

The action shots were taken between 1992 and 1998 by English teacher Daryl Scott Chapman, 41, who has lived in Hong Kong since he was 16.

The dramatic images show planes land on the 11,000 foot-long runway against the dramatic backdrop of the densely-populated city.

The Kai Tak landing required special training as pilots had to take a challenging last-minute manual turn known as a 'Hong Kong Turn' after they saw a checkerboard reference point above Kowloon Tsai Park.

The alarmingly steep descent over the harbour and crowded high-rise tower blocks meant Kai Tak was hailed as one of the most dangerous airports in the world.

Risky: 270 people were killed in 12 air accidents at Kai Tak. It served as Hong Kong's main airport until it was shut down by the Government in 1998 for overcrowding

U-turn: A plane from Kai Tak Airport aborts its landing in Hong Kong due to stormy weather. Pilots were aware of the difficulty of the landing and the conditions required to do it successfully

Tight squeeze: This remarkable image shows the moment a Cathay Pacific aircraft from Kai Tak Airport flies through the city's buildings that are densely-populated

Scrapped: The airport is now the new Kai Tak Cruise Terminal, for cruise liners. It is 15 years since the dangerous site was used as an airport

Built-up: A Cathay 747 700 from Kai Tak Airport gets ready to fly from the infamously perilous runway that juts out into the sinking harbour

Kai Tak was Hong Kong's main airport until 1998. It had suffered a shocking 12 air disasters with 270 people killed 
during this time - yet was handling nearly 30 million passengers 
per-year by 1996.

The deadliest incident was a
 US Marines Hercules flight which plunged into the harbour shortly after
 take-off in 1965, killing 59 passengers.

24 passengers were killed during a typhoon
 landing in 1967 and, in 1993, a Boeing 747 overran the runway during a typhoon.

The site of those dramatic flights has now been repurposed as 
the new Kai Tak Cruise Terminal, for crusie liners.
