Exploitation: Insurance fraudster Shoaib Nawaz

A crackdown on whiplash fraud has led to a 10 per cent fall in the number of motor insurance injury claims, figures reveal today.

This has seen the cost of motoring personal injury claims by controversial companies cashing in on them plummet by 33 per cent from £354million to £238million, a report by industry watchdogs says.

The £116million reduction – the first in a decade – follows legal changes last year and a cull of claims management companies, whose numbers have fallen by 35 per cent to 1,214.

‘There appears to be a correlation between these drops,’ the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries says. As a result, it adds, the cost of average third-party motor insurance premiums has fallen by nearly a fifth.

The report says: ‘The number of claims management companies has now halved from its peak of more than 2,500 in 2011 and stands at levels last seen at the end of 2007.’

The crackdown last year came after MPs on the all-party transport select committee condemned the motor insurance claims system as ‘dysfunctional’, making Britain ‘the whiplash capital of Europe’ because of widespread fraud.

The targets of the crackdown included ‘crash-for-cash’ gangs such as the one run by Mohammed Omar Gulzar, 31, who devised at least 39 collisions across South Yorkshire to claim up to £500,000 from insurance companies.

Working with actors and the fraudulent company City Claims 4 U, Gulzar filed dozens of claims for injuries such as whiplash.

On one occasion, he and his employee Shoaib Nawaz, 25, filled a single-decker bus with co-conspirators, before driver Adam Herbert – who was in on the plot – deliberately crashed into a Vauxhall Zafira. Afterwards, 25 people made claims for whiplash.

In January, Gulzar and Nawaz were jailed for four-and-a-half and three-and-a-half years respectively for conspiring to defraud insurance companies. Herbert, 26, was jailed for 20 months.

The IFoA has long expressed concern about ‘discrepancies’ showing that while the number of damage claims was falling, those for personal injury were soaring.

But David Brown, one of the authors of the new report, said: ‘Legal changes in 2013 appear to have had a significant impact on motor insurance injury claims.’

The biggest changes were those imposed under the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment Offenders Act, which slashed the fees that could be earned by ‘no-win, no-fee’ legal firms.

The Government announced last October that whiplash cheats would be targeted by independent medical panels considering evidence only from accredited doctors so that ‘people can no longer profit from exaggerated or fraudulent compensation claims’.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said this would help ‘turn the tide on the compensation culture’.

Referal fees paid by lawyers, insurers and claims firms have also been outlawed. Claims firms have been banned from rewarding individuals who bring them business, and the maximum that lawyers can charge for handling uncontested minor injury claims has been slashed from £1,200 to £500, removing a key incentive to settle without asking too many questions.

Mr Brown said: ‘The motor insurance industry anticipated the impact of legal changes and has already passed on the reduction in costs to consumers.’

Simon Douglas, director of AA Insurance, said that while the reforms had put ‘downward pressure’ on premiums, ‘too many people are tempted to make a claim knowing that whiplash injury is extremely difficult to disprove’.

He added: ‘Government intervention to further toughen up the legal processes could help prevent the otherwise inevitable.’
