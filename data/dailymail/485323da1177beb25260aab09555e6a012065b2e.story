In November, Panettiere the former Heroes star told Hello magazine she was excited about having a daughter.

She said: 'I’m thrilled that I am having a girl first because I feel like I know a lot about raising a strong woman.'

Panettiere also discussed how she expected to gain a little weight when she got pregnant, but did not realise how much she would actually put on.

The Heroes star admitted that she gained almost 40 pounds during her pregnancy, as she was pictured at a fashion event in New York back in May

The blonde beauty said: 'I'm 5 feet, 2 inches and I started out at 106 pounds and guess how much I weight now? Around 145 pounds.

'And the worst part is that my feet are still size five and they're going, ''What's going on with all this weight?'' They're about to snap from underneath me with the strain.'

For Halloween, Panettiere took to Twitter to post a photo of her showing off her bump in a racy cheetah costume featuring a string bikini.
