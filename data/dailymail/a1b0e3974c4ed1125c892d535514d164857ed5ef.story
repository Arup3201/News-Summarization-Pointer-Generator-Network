A woman has been arrested by police officers investigating claims that a black woman made racist comments about white people on a London bus, Scotland Yard said today.

The Metropolitan Police said a 34-year-old woman was arrested this afternoon at an address in Hackney on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence and is being questioned at an east London police station.

A force spokesman said the arrest came after they began examining video footage of a woman making comments on a bus.

The woman, whose identity has not yet been confirmed, begins her tirade of racist abuse looking directly at the camera

The middle-aged black woman remains seated at first, then stands up in anger as she shouts expletives directed towards white people

The footage, recorded by a fellow 
passenger, was posted to video sharing website YouTube and has been 
watched by more than 19,200 people as of this evening.

It showed a middle-aged black woman 
telling passengers on the bus how she 'hates white people' who 'all want
 to be f****** black'.

She begins the tirade of abuse by shouting: 'I'm so glad. I'm born black and I'll die black. I was born African and I'll f****** die African.'

The foul-mouthed woman then goes on to tell the passengers: 'The only reason I was born in this country is because you f****** people brought my people here.'

'My parents are f****** African, born in Jamaica. And I’m f****** African, born in England and I can’t stand you white people, I tell you.'

She screams at a passenger on the bus and points her arm at them in anger

Holding her mobile phone with her mouth wide open, she looks both in shock and disgusted as she continues her tirade of abuse sitting down

Footage of the incident emerged on 
YouTube on August 17 after a string of similar public rants by women 
were made on various forms of London transport earlier this year and 
last year.

It shows the woman, whose name is not known, sitting on a crowded bus shouting at the top of her voice.

Wearing
 a black leather jacket and grey T-shirt, she continues her rant by 
saying: 'I don’t care what none of you lot got to say because at the end
 of the day if you lot would have had a choice you will f****** go with 
your people and I’ll go with mine.

'The whole lot of you are programmed, f****** puppets. Not this one, I’m black and proud.'

She
 then spits on the floor and picks up her phone and can be heard 
describing those around her as “f****** doughnuts and puppets on the 
bus.'

'I'm black and proud', she added.

The woman, who could face prosecution, then becomes increasingly more aggressive, stating: 'They all want to be f***ing black, they all put fat in their lips and their bottoms and sit down on the sun bed to be black.'

She answers her mobile phone and can be heard describing those around her as 'f****** doughnuts and puppets on the bus'

As the woman becomes increasingly more aggressive, she repeatedly gets up and down

She then turns her attention to 
another passenger and asks 'Am I lying, am I lying?' Answering the 
question with: 'No I aint f****** lying.'

The woman repeatedly gets up and down during the video as she hurls the abuse while astonished onlookers try to ignore her.

She
 finally finishes her rant by complaining about the Queen’s Diamond 
Jubilee, and states that 'the same f****** diamond she has in her head, 
my people suffered for that.

'Free speech. I hate white people. I can’t stand none of you.'

And then looking at the camera, she adds: 'Strictly black, the more black the happier I am.'

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'On Monday, August 20 MPS officers began to assess footage of a woman that was brought to our attention. It shows a woman making comments on a bus.

'Officers are continuing to try and establish when and where the footage was taken.

'At 2.15pm this afternoon, Hackney police officers arrested a 34-year-old woman at an address in Hackney on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence, and she is now in custody at an east London police station.'

Captured in the height of her rage: The woman raises her hand in the air and screams

The video emerged after similar clips were uploaded on to the internet.

One recorded on the central line train showed secretary Jacqueline Woodhouse, 42, from Romford, Essex, hurl abuse at Asian passengers.

She was jailed for 21 weeks after she pleaded guilty to one count of causing racially aggravated harassment, alarm or distress by using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour.

Another video called ‘Welcome to London’ showed a woman holding a pink rose on the London Underground as she abused passengers.

Another was of a drunk woman who tried to punch a black passenger on a London bus, but ended up falling over herself then being thrown into the street.

Yesterday the Metropolitan Police confirmed that the footage had been brought to their attention and they were currently assessing it.
