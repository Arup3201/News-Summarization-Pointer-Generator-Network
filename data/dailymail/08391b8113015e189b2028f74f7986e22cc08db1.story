Disgraced rugby star Ian Gough  wore a customised scrum cap in support of a fathers' rights campaign group during a match following claims that he only has limited access to his son.

He said that he wore the Spriderman scrum cap, which was printed with his son's initials, to back New Fathers 4 Justice - whose supporters have staged protests dressed as superheroes.

The former Wales international has claimed that he does not have enough access to the son he had with former Playboy model Sophia Cahill, whom he was convicted of assaulting earlier this year.

The 37-year-old wore the cap while playing for the Newport Dragons in a rugby union match in Llanelli, West Wales, earlier this month. 

But following the televised game, rugby chiefs served him with a written warning claiming he had breached 'commercial rules' because the cap also had the letters NF4J - which stands for New Fathers 4 Justice - on it.

Gough said: 'I'm pretty disappointed with the decision made by the governing body.

'However I do realise after it being pointed out that it conflicted with the rules concerning advertising.

'I take this on board and accept their decisions.'

Ms Cahill, who was crowned Ms Wales in 2000, split up with Gough in 2011 while she was still pregnant with their child.

She became engaged to former pop star Dane Bowers in December last year.

Gough was convicted of assaulting Ms Cahill as he dropped off their young son outside the home she shares with Mr Bowers in south London in January.

The rugby player, who is 6ft 5in and weighs nearly 19 stone, was said to have 'manhandled and shoved' the mother of his child, after arriving an hour late to leave the youngest in her and Mr Bowers' care.

Gough, who made 64 appearances for Wales, was convicted of assault and was ordered to pay £2,130 in fines and costs. 

It is the second time this year that the rugby player has been pictured wearing a customised scrum cap. 

In May this year, Gough wore another cap printed with NF4J during a game in May.

At the time, he  said he pulled the stunt in support of the campaign group to highlight the plight of fathers who are refused access to their children by the courts.

After the match he said: 'I did this for all the fathers and grandparents who get little or no access to see their children. 

'In my experience over the last year fathers have no rights regarding contact with their children. It is not wrong for fathers to campaign for equality and more rights. Those that do should be supported.

'Good loving fathers should have an automatic right to see their children and not have to go through a protracted court battle. 

'When parents split up they should put aside their differences and share their children.'

New Fathers 4 Justice welcomed his support saying 'Ian is a known supporter of fathers' rights'. 

A spokesman for the Pro12 league game said: 'No logos, messages or advertising may be displayed on player's kit at matches save for the club logo, the kit manufacturer's logo and messages promoting club sponsors.'
