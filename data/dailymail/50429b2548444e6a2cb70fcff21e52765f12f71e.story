A letter from Lord Nelson to his mistress Emma Hamilton after the birth of their love-child Horatia in 1801 is set to go under the hammer

A letter sent from Lord Nelson to his mistress Lady Emma Hamilton a fortnight after the birth of their secret love child has gone under the hammer.

In the note, dated February 12, 1801, Nelson talks in code, pretending the child actually belongs to a fictitious Admiral named Thomson and that he and Miss Hamilton are the child's godparents.

Speaking about himself and Miss Hamilton in the third person, Nelson says: 'Assure her of his unalterable and affectionate regard' adding that 'all the world cannot either change or make him wish to change for a moment and that he is unalterably hers.'

Nelson also speaks about his fear that the affair will be discovered, worrying that his letters will be intercepted, and revealing that he has a Midshipman post them for fear of discovery.

The couple's love-child Horatia, named after Nelson, was born on January 29, 1801, while he was still married to Frances 'Fanny' Nisbet.

Despite Nelson's attempts at hiding the affair, word did eventually reach Fanny that Miss Hamilton had given birth to the child she had so longed for with her husband.

Following a set of bitter arguments, Fanny stood her ground and demanded that Nelson chose between his two loves, leading to their scandalous separation before Nelson was killed in 1805.

The letter is one of three being sold by a private collector at Christie’s in London and is expected to fetch between £10,000 and £15,000.

A Christie’s spokesman said: 'The letter betrays some of the insecurities that beset the couple, including the constant fear that one of their letters - full of thinly-veiled affection with neither party well disguised by their use of the "Thomson" alias - would fall into strange hands.

'From his proclamations of affection it also seems that Emma, or "Mrs Thomson" as she appears here, had questioned Nelson’s devotion.

A second letter going under the hammer is from Nelson to Spencer Smith, praising Spencer's brother William who helped him mastermind the defence of Acre

'Accusations of emotional infidelity and neglect recur throughout their correspondence and saw him whipped into agonies of jealousy and despair.

'Based in England during the final negotiations of the Peace of Amiens, Nelson could frequently visit Emma and play some part in the life of his illegitimate daughter, Horatia.'

The second letter up for auction from Lord Nelson was written in the wake of the successful British defence of Acre, masterminded by William Sidney Smith.

The letter is to his brother the minister-plenipotentiary in Constantinople, Spencer Smith expressing his pride of his brother's actions.

It is expected to sell for between £5,000 and £8,000.

The final letter is addressed to the Prime Minister Henry Addington and is valued at between £4,000 and £6,000.

A third letter, thought to be worth between £4,000 and £6,000, sees Nelson arguing with his superiors over pay - suggesting he is being given less than other Admirals after a victory

In it Lord Nelson complains of his unequal financial treatment relative to his fellow victorious admirals Earl St Vincent and Viscount Duncan.

Lady Emma Hamilton, who was the daughter of a blacksmith, married the much older Sir William Hamilton in 1791, the British Envoy to Naples.

Lord Nelson won three of the most decisive naval victories in British history at the Nile in 1798, Copenhagen in 1801 and Trafalgar in 1805. 

He was seriously wounded four times, losing his right arm, and was famously killed by a French sniper aboard HMS Victory during the Battle of Trafalgar.

Emma Hamilton began life as a blacksmith's daughter, worked in a sex shop in London, became a well-known mistress to high society, and died in poverty in Calais in 1814

Emma Hamilton may have been made famous as history's 'other woman', tempting Lord Nelson away from loving wife Fanny Nisbet, but she began life as the daughter of a blacksmith.

Born as Amy Hart in The Wirral, Cheshire, in 1765, her father died when she was two months ols so she was raised by her mother Mary Kidd in the Cotswolds.

Without any formal education she moved to London around 1980, changed her name to Emma Lyon, and began working for infamous 'sexologist' Dr James Graham at his Temple of Health.

Scantily dressed as Vestina, the Goddess of Health, she would be the first sight that guests coming to the pleasure house would see walking through the door.

The temple was a den of debauchery, and featured a bed through which an electric current could be passed as couples copulated on top of it, and supposedly cured infertility.

Here, aged just 15, Emma learned the arts of the oldest profession, and began mixing with well-to-do socialites including Sir Harry Featherstonhaugh, who took her for a mistress.

Following the birth of a love-child, she passed into the hands of Charles Francis Greville, who was so obsessed with her looks that he sent her to be painted by his friend George Romney.

So charmed was Romney by the young, beautiful Miss Lyon, he made her his muse, and over the years painted her dozens of times - both clothed and nude.

Greville, the nephew of the British Ambassador to Naples, eventually took Miss Lyon abroad where she fell into the arms of his uncle, Sir William Hamilton, who married her.

Now firmly installed in the ranks of the social elite, and with her beauty well known throughout Britain, Emma was first introduced to Lord Nelson in 1793 when he visited Napes to gather reinforcements to fight the French.

Nelson had been happily married for nearly a decade up to this point, and once wrote of his wife Frances, that: ‘Until I married her I never knew happiness and I am certain she will continue to make me happy for the rest of my life.’

However he immediately fell under Emma's spell, and the two began an affair with the knowledge and blessing of Emma's husband, who invited Nelson to stay with them in London two years later.

Emma gave birth to their daughter, Horatia, shortly afterwards - prompting Fanny to write to Nelson, saying she was willing to forgive him if he would only come back to her.

In return he offered Fanny £2,000 a year while he and the Hamiltons lived in Surrey.

Frances was furious, stood her ground, and demanded that Nelson chose either her, or Emma. Nelson refused to see her, and returned one of her letters with the note: 'Opened by mistake by Lord Nelson but not read.’ 

The couple separated, scandalising the nation, shortly before Nelson died at Trafalgar in 1805.

Cast out from Nelson's side, many expected the figures of Frances Nisbet to shrink into obscurity, but she remained a firm fixture at court until her death in 1831.

Emma, meanwhile, took to drink, plunged into debt, fled to France where she died in poverty in at Calais 1814.
