With its Union flag roof, painting of the Battle of Waterloo on the side and portrait of the Queen at her Coronation emblazoned on the bonnet, this car needs a seriously patriotic buyer.

Artist Paul Karslake bought the 1990 Bentley Mulsanne and then customised it with paintings of some of the most glorious moments in British history.

Now the one-of-a-kind car is up for auction in Weybridge, Surrey, where it is expected to sell for at least £15,000.

Mr Karslake, 55, brother of Ronnie Wood's ex-wife Jo, chose to paint wartime Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill on the boot, alongside scenes from the Battle of Britain and the Falklands War.

The car's rear pillar carries a portrait of the Duke of Wellington with scenes of the Battle of Waterloo along the off-side rear wings.

And the near-side rear pillar includes a portrait of Admiral Nelson together with scenes of the Battle of Trafalgar.

The entire roof is adorned with a dramatic rendering of the Union flag with a Second World War Lancaster bomber flying over it.

In addition to the dramatic portraits, the Bentley's front wings feature scenes from the First World War along with the poignant addition of poppies over the wheel arches.

Eccentric Mr Karslake is better known for his portraits of the likes of Keith Richards and The Kray Twins.

Mr Karslake says he is 'sick and tired of wishy-washy art' and wanted to do something 'concise and patriotic'

He said: 'I am sick and tired of wishy-washy art. I wanted to do something that was detailed, concise and patriotic, and I think this ticks all the boxes. Never surrender.'

Mr Karslake has used the Bentley as his personal car for the past 18 months, and it has 108,000 miles on the clock.

Under the bonnet is a 6.75-litre V8 engine which gives the luxury saloon a 0-60mph time of ten seconds and a top speed of 120mph.

The artist has now decided to part ways with the Bentley, dubbed The Empire Car, and it will be sold alongside more than 120 other cars at the Historics car auction on November 30.

John Williams, from Historics, said: 'Very rarely have we consigned a car that exudes such passion.

'Paul Karslake has produced the most exquisite piece of automotive art and a superb, unique and moving tribute to British history.'
