'Embarrassed': Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has vowed to clean up the Church's portfolio

The Archbishop of Canterbury is to review the Church’s investment strategy, after ‘very embarrassing’ revelations that it has holdings in firms that profit from payday lending, and may have invested in companies involved in arms dealing and pornography.

The Most Reverend Justin Welby said he was irritated and embarrassed to discover that the Church has indirectly invested in payday loan firm Wonga, which earlier this week he vowed to drive out of business.

It also emerged that the Church’s ‘ethical’ rules allow it to invest its £5.2billion assets in firms involved in gambling, tobacco and alcohol.

Even firms involved in arms dealing, pornography and human cloning are not barred from receiving Church investment.

The Archbishop confirmed the Church had a £75,000 stake in US venture capital firm Accel Partners, which injected capital into Wonga in 2009.

The disclosure came less than 48 hours after he revealed he had told Wonga chief executive Errol Damelin that he wanted to drive the firm ‘out of business’ by supporting not-for-profit credit unions.

The Archbishop said: ‘What’s clear is that this is an embarrassment.

'We think that the payday lenders charge vastly excessive amounts for the loans they make, that there is a totally inadequate range of choice for consumers in deprived areas.

‘It shouldn’t happen. It’s very embarrassing, but these things do happen. We have to find out why and make sure it doesn’t happen again.’

Lambeth Palace said an independent inquiry would be launched into the Wonga investment to uncover how ‘this serious inconsistency’ occurred.

The Church’s investment portfolio is managed by the Church Commissioners, who are not directly controlled by the Archbishop.

Under the Commissioners’ rules, they can invest in firms who make up to 25 per cent of their money through payday lending or gambling, up to 10 per cent through arms dealing or up to 3 per cent from pornography.

The Archbishop said these thresholds should be revisited, adding that the Church ‘shouldn’t be investing in Wonga’.

He said: ‘I think we have to review these levels and make sure we are consistent between what we’re saying and what we’re doing.’

Symon Hill, spokesman for the campaign group Christianity Uncut, said revelations about the Church’s investments were ‘extraordinary’.

'I think we have to review these levels and make sure we are consistent between what we’re saying and what we’re doing.'

Mr Hill said: ‘It is complicated. Of course, no one is expecting Justin Welby to have every figure from the church accounts in his head.

‘But there is this issue of percentages. The Church of England can invest in a company that sells arms, as long as arms are less than 10 per cent of its business – which in the case of a big company can still be millions of pounds.

‘I think it’s a problem, and with payday lenders it isn’t even 10 per cent, it’s 25 per cent – a sizeable chunk of any company’s business.’

But the Archbishop said it was a ‘complex’ issue, and warned it was difficult to invest in firms that had no controversial operations, such as hotel chains who made money from pornography sold in their rooms.

The Church needed to be realistic in accepting that the ‘complexity of the markets means that a lot of companies get involved in things at a very small level, indirectly’.

He said it was a ‘valid question’ whether a ‘little sin’ was tolerable, adding: ‘Sin is a bad thing by definition. Just for the record, I’m not in favour of sin.’

The Archbishop revealed that the Church was examining whether it could invest directly in rivals to firms such as Wonga, which have been blamed for driving desperate families into debt by charging annual interest rates of more than 5,500 per cent a year on loans.
