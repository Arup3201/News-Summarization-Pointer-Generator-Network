The baby girl, who was sold by its own parents in China after they realised how much money they could make from child trafficking 

A married couple who trafficked children including their own baby have been arrested in China.

Gong Tan, 43, and his wife Li Ming Juan were detained at a hotel after staff overheard them discussing the prices of babies in Haiyan County in eastern China's Zhjiang Province.

Police swooped on the hotel and picked up the pair just after they had finished meeting a contact.

When arrested they told officers they had got into baby trafficking when 40-year-old Li gave birth to the couple's fourth child.

They claim the were unable to avoid having another child and were desperate to avoid trouble due to the Chinese policy of couples only being allowed to have three children.

They then contacted traffickers who offered them £1,860 for their newborn daughter.

Gong said: 'This woman then went on to sell our baby for £4,140.

'We realised there was big money to be made from this so when she approached us again and offered us a full-time job in baby trafficking we agreed.'

Police believe that Gong and his wife then went on a kidnapping spree and plucked babies from their unsuspecting mothers before selling them on.

Spokesman Zhou Lieufei explained: 'We managed to track down four babies, one of which we believe is theirs.

'We are now running a DNA test on them to try and identify their real parents.

'We also arrested the woman behind this gang and she is currently being questioned.

Another two of the babies that the couple are accused of selling. Police believe the pair went on a kidnapping spree and plucked children from their unsuspecting mothers before selling them on 

'We urge all families that if they have a child they cannot afford or do not want, to put them into an adoption programme.

'Do not sell them on to traffickers.'

Child trafficking is a taboo subject in China, although they do acknowledge that the problem exists.

However, there are no statistics about the number of children kidnapped or the number of children sold into adoption.
