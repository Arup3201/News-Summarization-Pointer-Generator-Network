Attempted suicide: Luis Toledo tried to kill himself in custody after he was taken in for questioning over the murder of his wife and her two children

A Florida man suspected of murdering his wife and her two children tried to commit suicide by cutting himself with broken jail cell mirror while in custody.

Luis Toledo, 31, was being held in Volusia County Jail in Daytona Beach for questioning about the deaths of Yessenia Suarez, 28, and children Michael Otto, 8, and Thalia Otto, 9, when he smashed his head into a bathroom mirror according to WFTV-TV.

Just hours after the trio were last seen, Toledo was involved in a domestic dispute with Ms Suarez in which he allegedly slapped her at her workplace after he became angry about text messages he found on her phone.

Accord to ABC News,
Toledo was taken to Halifax Health Medical Center with non life- 
threatening injuries on Saturday after he tried to cut himself with 
broken pieces of glass from the mirror.

According to jail records, Toledo - a
known gang member - was arrested on a domestic battery charge last 
Wednesday after the alleged disturbance.

The
Volusia County Sheriff's Office confirmed that the woman and her two 
children were dead but that their bodies were yet to be recovered.

In
a statement on their website, the authorities said: 'Based on the 
investigative findings, the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office’s Major Case
Unit has discovered that the missing Deltona mother and her two 
children are deceased.

'The
search for the victims’ bodies and the investigation into their deaths 
is still ongoing and no one has been charged at this time.'

‘Keep
in mind this is a very sensitive investigation and we want to be sure 
it comes to a satisfactory conclusion,’ a sheriff’s office spokesperson 
told the station.

Confirmed dead: Yessenia Suarez, 28, and her children, 8-year-old Michael Otto and 9-year-old Thalia Otto disappeared after the woman had an alleged domestic dispute with Toledo last week. Police confirmed that all three were dead

‘We will make sure the family gets satisfaction when this is finally all over,’ he added.

The mother and children were last seen on Tuesday and police began looking into their disappearance on Wednesday, the station said.

He had gone to Ms Suarez's office to confront her about text messages he found on her phone, according to ClickOrlando. He also wanted to speak to coworkers but could not find them, the station added.

A Florida missing child alert was issued for both children early Thursday.

It is not clear if the children are from a previous marriage or relationship.

Characterized
by the sheriff's office as a gang member, Mr Toledo has multiple 
arrests and has even served time in prison under an alias.

He has multiple burglary, kidnapping and firearms charges brought against him in the past, according to ClickOrlando.

Mr Toledo even served a four-year prison term under the name Michael Garcia.

He has also been arrested under the names Luis Colon and Hector Soto, according to records cited by ClickOrlando.

Both cars registered to Mr Toledo have been recovered – one at the couple’s home and the other at a local shopping center, according to WKMG.

The last family members heard from Ms Suarez was Tuesday night, they told WKMG.

The woman's family has suspected the violent man from the beginning.

'Please, please I beg you Luis,' Felicia Perez, Ms Suarez's mother said, according to Click Orlando said.

'You know you know where they at, please, that's all I ask.'
