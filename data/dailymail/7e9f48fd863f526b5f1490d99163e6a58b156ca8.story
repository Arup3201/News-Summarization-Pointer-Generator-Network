Lindsay Lohan entered rehab on Thursday morning as she began her 90 days of court-ordered treatment.

And the facility wasted no time in getting the actress stuck into the program.

She checked into Morningside Recovery at 8.45am and was scheduled to meet with a psychiatrist later that day, according to her lawyer.

Getting help: Lindsay Lohan's lawyer Mark Heller (L) appeared in court on Thursday morning while at the same time the actress was entering a rehab facility

The 26-year-old was sentenced to the stint in the facility 
after pleading no contest to charges for lying to police about driving 
during a car crash last June.

At the exact time Lindsay was entering the California based centre, her lawyer Mark Heller was in court.

Lindsay switched facilities after deciding she didn’t want to attend New York based rehab Seafield because it banned smoking.

Checking in: According to reports Lindsay entered the California centre at 8.45am to start her 90 day stint

Under fire: It has been claimed that Morningside Recovery cannot offer treatment after its licence was revoked

As going to a different centre that 
was not approved by the court technically broke her plea agreement, the 
star’s attorney was required to appear before a judge.

Heller, who wore an eyesore of a tie in 
red and black stripes for the hearing, was attempting to convince Judge James R Dabney 
to approve of the switch.

He argued that as Lindsay has already
entered and is ‘ensconced’ in the program, it could effect her recovery should she have to move facilities.

‘She's
going to be meeting with a psychiatrist later today,’ Heller explained, 
reinforcing that the star is ‘commencing immediate treatment’.

It comes amid claims that the centre in fact does not even have a licence to offer residential treatment as it was revoked in May 2012.

According
to TMZ, Morningside had their licence suspended after they were found 
to be careless with prescription drugs and went beyond the constraints 
of the licence.

Starting off on the right foot: Heller claims that Lindsay will be meeting with a psychiatrist later in the day

Looking out for Lindsay: Mark told Judge James R. Dabney that it would be a bad idea to move his client already

The Deputy Director of Licensing and 
Certificates at the California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs 
told the website: ‘Morningside cannot give any treatment,’ as the rehab 
centre is allegedly only allowed to provide a sober living facility.

A representative clarified to Radar Online that it can, however treat outpatients. 'Morningside can’t provide residential treatment to anyone, but they can provide outpatient services,' the rep explained.

The
judge however didn’t seem to have too many qualms about the switch to 
that particular facility, despite the fact that it was not one on a list
of six centres approved by the court.

Convincing: Lindsay chose a rehab centre which was not approved by the court so Mark was attempting to get the judge to OK the decision

Fighting his corner: The switch to a different rehab technically violates Lindsay's plea agreement and now the centre must be approved

‘It
does appear to comply,’ Judge Dabney said, adding that the prosecution 
had eight days to decide whether or not they will agree with the centre 
being approved.

‘I don't have any problems with Miss Lohan remaining in this program until the issue is resolved,’ he said.

‘If
we decide the program does not meet the requirements of the plea 
agreement then she will have to move to a different program.’

Nicotine fix: It has been claimed that Lindsay switched facilities as the centre she was scheduled to stay in had a no-smoking ban

Staying put: The Liz & Dick star will stay in the California facility until a decision has been made by the court

He
explained: 'The issue is going to be whether or not we need to set a 
hearing because the people are complaining [the centre] does not fit the
parameters.'

TMZ however alleges that Lindsay never entered the facility at all and instead was spotted at a Fry's Electronics store in Fountain Valley at 9am, while Heller was in court stating she had checked into rehab.

Heller and Terry White of the prosecution will reconvene in front of the judge on May 10, at which point it will be determined whether or not they will set a date for a restitution hearing.

Lindsay's lawyer said he has faith 
that Morningside will be approved, even though White claimed he had 
three separate news articles which showed the facility in a bad light.

Final moments of freedom: On Wednesday Lindsay spent her last day before rehab shopping and chain-smoking

'If [White] says he's satisfied then I don't think we have to come back,' Heller said, adding, 'I'm 100% sure he will be satisfied.'

Heller then claimed that he will 'make sure [Lindsay] stays in therapy', and had called in the COO of Morningside in the hope that she could win over White.

The judge later stated that Lindsay will not have to appear in court as the case continues 'as long as she is in compliance'.

In addition, none of the star's progress reports are to be released to the public aside from 'proof of completion' at the end of her stay.
