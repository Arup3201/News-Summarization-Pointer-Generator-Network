The BBC’s expenses bill for its top executives has increased by nearly 50 per cent in just three months, fuelled by a huge surge in the amount spent on flights.

Last night the broadcaster blamed the move of its payroll operations to India and the number of international conferences for the increase in flight costs.

However, the cost of taxis and rail tickets were also up on the previous three month period.

The BBC yesterday claimed most of the expenses were 'unavoidable routine costs' but said it was 'mindful' of spending public money'

The latest disclosure reveals that in the quarter to the end of December last year the total expenses bill for its top bosses hit £206,401 up from almost £139,000 in the previous period and also up, by about 20 per cent on the same period last year.

The cost of flights, which took in cities including Washington, Dallas, Delhi and Johannesburg, nearly doubled from £33,949 in the same quarter in 2011 to £65,654 in 2012.

Rail fares, many of which paid to ferry bosses between London and its new Salford base, were 15 per cent up from the previous period to £39,980, but were down on the equivalent period from the previous year.

Taxis, which saw some bosses repeatedly rack up large fares, at times topping £100, hit £32,948, which was up by more than 10 per cent on the previous period.

The BBC yesterday claimed most of the expenses were ‘unavoidable routine costs’ but said it was ‘mindful’ of spending public money.

But it was unable to provide figures as to how much the cost of flights had gone up on the previous three month period.

While the year on year figure for hotels - £26,000 - was slightly down there were still lots of claims for people staying in hotels near the MediaCity base in Salford

While the year on year figure for hotels - £26,000 - was slightly down there were still lots of claims for people staying in hotels near the MediaCity base in Salford.

Jonathan Isaby, Political Director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘BBC bosses need to focus on delivering value for licence fee payers’ cash and these latest expense claims will not instil public confidence that they are doing so.

‘They need to cut down on unnecessary expenditure and in an age where video-conferencing and Skype make international communication extremely cheap and easy, spending on flights should be significantly reduced.

‘Licence fee payers expect their money to be spent on making quality programmes, not flying the BBC top brass around the world to attend a succession of conferences.’

Among the more eye-catching claims was Radio 3 controller Roger Wright’s £450 for an external private dinner for ‘Free Thinking Contributors’ in November. Radio 3 holds a Free Thinking Festival and for the dinner there said to have been nine people attending.

Acting director of news Fran Unsworth claimed for a £2,400 return flight to Dehli in November and also a £2,195 flight to Johannesburg in August.

The corporation’s human resources chief Lucy Adams spent £446 discussing ideas for ‘staff engagement’ with eight people.

Creative director Alan Yentob claimed for a £1,867.20 flight to Los Angeles.

Marketing chief Philip Almond spent £126 on a taxi for ‘Attending D&AD’s 50th anniversary event’ and then £117.34 cab fare to go to the Sports Personality of the Year.

The BBC’s entertainment boss also claimed for high priced taxi fares including one for £112.67 and another for £142.72.

The BBC boss of the corporation’s programme-making arm Pat Younge spent £405 on business entertainment for ‘Networking/reflection at the end of training’, but it was for 28 people.

BBC Scotland director Ken MacQuarrie racked up a hotel bill for £811 for five nights.

The disclosure also included the latest entries in the hospitality register for top bosses.

Director of BBC North Peter Salmon was a guest of Manchester City Football Club when he went to watch them play Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League.

The new TV chief Danny Cohen, formerly BBC1 boss was given a box of wine by Mrs Merton comedienne Caroline Aherne. He then distributed it ‘among the BBC One team’. He is said to have also received Christmas presents from independent companies all below £50 in value.

Similarly the BBC’s new comedy boss Shane Allen received champagne from three production companies but in each case ‘Donated to charity’.

The expenses also showed that the BBC’s head of editorial standards David Jordan was forced to abandon his attendance at the Society of Editor’s Annual Conference, for which he had booked flights, at the height of the Savile crisis.

A BBC spokesperson said: ‘The majority of these expenses are unavoidable routine costs incurred in running a major international broadcasting organisation. Whilst there will inevitably be fluctuation in spend from year to year we are mindful that we are spending public money and are working hard to keep these costs to a minimum.’
