Avoid giving cancer patients chocolates and sweets - there are so many other wonderful presents 

In the second part of her no-nonsense guide to thriving with cancer, Lucy O’Donnell explains how to cope with chemotherapy – and why sweet treats are the last thing you should give a patient...

What gift do you give a woman with cancer? While a well-thought-out present will be hugely appreciated, there are plenty of things to avoid, too.

Once, while I was in hospital, a friend brought me cupcakes. They were beautiful little things, and I just couldn’t restrain myself. But even before my diagnosis with stage four, incurable breast cancer in 2011, I tried to stick to a diet free from processed foods and sugar.

Other friends gave me pyjamas, bed socks, a beautiful soft poncho, organic body creams, bath oils and lavender eyes masks. There are so many wonderful, helpful things out there, so you don’t need to give chocolates, sweets or champagne.

FUEL FOR THE FIGHT

I believe that during cancer treatment, when your immune system is being battered by the disease and the toxic drugs used to kill it, it’s even more important not to consume things that have been altered with synthetic chemicals and preservatives. And that includes sugar-laden ‘treats’.

And although I never stopped exercising, when you’re fatigued during chemo and radiotherapy, you simply can’t do it with as much vigour. I was often limited to some gentle stretching in my room, but anything is better than nothing. The aim is to keep your circulation going as this helps recovery.

Going back to those cupcakes, I enjoyed every moment of eating them. You do have to allow yourself to break the rules occasionally.

I live by the 80/20 rule: if you get it rigorously right most of the time, eating only fresh, unprocessed food and produce – vegetables, fish, poultry, just a little red meat and no added sugar – you can have moments where you let go.

CHEMO… IN COMFORT

Chemotherapy is the use of medicines to kill or slow the growth of rapidly multiplying cancer cells. Once the medicines enter the bloodstream, they travel to all parts of the body in order to reach cancer cells that may have spread beyond the primary source. You will have heard about the sickness, nausea and hair loss that often accompany chemotherapy, but other side effects may include dry eyes, coldness, heartburn, a sore mouth, tingling hands and feet, and memory loss. Here’s how I dealt with some of the side effects from my treatment:

It is vitally important that you rest while undergoing treatment - you have to give in to fatigue

REST IS BEST

By the time I was into radiotherapy, I had endured eight operations, chemotherapy, and much more. I wrongly assumed I could do normal things, and would then find myself in a supermarket or at a children’s sports match in a desperate state. My point is you have to give in to fatigue. REST! REST! REST! And ACCEPT! ACCEPT! ACCEPT! To do this, you must feel comfortable delegating tasks to friends and family. If you are anything like me, it’s not easy. But you have to.

Radiotherapy uses high levels of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing and dividing, while minimising damage to healthy cells. It is given to reduce your risk of local recurrence of the cancer and generally treatments start several weeks after surgery. It is very cold in the radiotherapy treatment rooms, which is necessary to keep these incredible machines cool. Bring a scarf, woolly socks and a hat. On the plus side, you feel nothing during the actual treatment, which lasts only a few minutes.

CARE FOR YOUR SKIN

Moisturise your skin constantly but only use the ones that your clinic gives or authorises you to use

In the area exposed to radiation, your skin may become red, swollen, itchy, warm and sensitive, as if you have nasty sunburn. It may peel or become moist and tender.

Gently cleanse the treated area using lukewarm water. I used to put moisturiser on first to act as a barrier cream and then get in the bath or shower. Do not submerge the treated area in the bath. And if you are showering, let the water trickle over it as little as possible.

Don’t rub your skin. Pat it dry with a soft towel instead or use a hairdryer on a cool setting.

Moisturise your skin constantly (I did it about three or four times a day). Only use the ones that your clinic gives or authorises you to use, because they must not contain aluminium or other chemicals.

Don’t apply cosmetics, shaving lotions, perfumes or deodorants on the treated area, and use only an electric razor if you need to shave that part of your body.

Make sure your baths are not too hot. I found this difficult as I was always freezing after treatments and longed for a hot, long soak.

Avoid tight-fitting clothes that might irritate your skin, and keep the treated area out of direct sunlight. Always wear a very high factor sunblock, even after your course of treatment has finished.

It is important to see a dentist before you start treatment to make sure your mouth is healthy. Chemotherapy affects the cells that line the mouth, so it becomes very dry. Any infection can run rife, meaning treatment must be stopped. It’s therefore important to head off any potential problems.

As chemo lowers the immune system, hygiene is very important. I travel everywhere with antibacterial hand gel. Anyone who had a cold wasn’t allowed to come near me as even a minor infection could have interrupted my treatment.

I also suffered from dry eyes and even blepharitis – infection in the eyelids linked to dry eyes. Moisturising sterile eye drops are hugely relieving and can help protect against this.

As my skin got terribly dry, I massaged in facial oils every night and used tinted SPF moisturiser during the day. I used to slather myself with body, hand, face and foot cream – always with natural products. I found that lots of bath oil helped too. This sounds laborious but it made a huge difference to my comfort.
