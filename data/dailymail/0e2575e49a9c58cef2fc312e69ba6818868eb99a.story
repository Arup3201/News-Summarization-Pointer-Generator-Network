He may be Brazil's poster boy with seemingly the whole world on his shoulders, but Neymar still seems to be up to his usual cheeky tricks.

The Barcelona forward was training for his home World Cup with his international team-mates when he produced this incredible piece of skill.

Neymar steps up to take the penalty, shaping up with his right foot, but out of nowhere flicks out his left to wrong-foot the goalkeeper.

Everyday penalty: Neymar shapes up for his spot-kick, looking like he's going to take it with his favoured right foot

Surprise: But the star somehow scores with his left foot, wrong-footing the goalkeeper

And he also seemed to be sneaking away from training to speak to his girlfriend Bruna Marquezine... even taking her hat.

Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari set up two teams in a training match. The first team beat the reserves 3-2, with Neymar on target

The Brazilians were travelling to Goiania, a city in the centre of the country, late on Sunday, and are the favourites for the tournament this summer.

Agony: Neymar looks in obvious pain as he clutches his right ankle in Brazil training

Fun and games: Neymar, Dani Alves and Fred take a break from their World Cup preparation

In the way: Brazil defender David Luiz pulls a funny face as he attempts to block a free-kick

Rough and tumble: Dani Alves is the recipient of a clumsy challenge from Brazil team-mate Fernandinho
