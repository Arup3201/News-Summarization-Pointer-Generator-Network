Like mince pies and mulled wine, gearing up for the post-Christmas diet is an inescapable part of the festive period.

But if the thought of swapping Christmas pudding for wheatgrass shots makes you shiver, help could be at hand in the form of a spa package that promises a complete body overhaul for reluctant dieters.

Along with cellulite-busting laser therapy, the package also includes an oxygen facial to pep up a drink-dulled complexion and laser hair removal to nix unwanted growth.

But there's a catch. Prices for a complete makeover start at £500 - and that doesn't include the cost of the repeat visits needed for some of the treatments.

Laser hair removal costs £189 per visit, which means that a complete course of six treatments will leave you shelling out at least £1,134.

A course of £50 SmoothShapes anti-cellulite procedures also adds up, with the recommended eight sessions totting up to £400.

More affordable is Destination Skin's Agera Oxygen facial, which also costs £50 per session but works instantly.

A favourite of Miranda Kerr and Jourdan Dunn, the treatment involves using oxygen-infused serums to brighten up dull skin.

Another A-list approved treatment included in the package is the QuickFix Intraceuticals Infusion, £135, which blasts the face with pure oxygen.

According to celebrity fans Justin Timberlake and Eva Longoria, it leaves skin bright, soft and glowing - a distinct improvement on dull January skin.
