Britain's sickly economy was last night facing a jobs bloodbath in the financial sector after HSBC warned that it was slashing 30,000 staff worldwide.

Thousands of its UK workers are facing an uncertain future after Britain’s largest bank yesterday unveiled a ‘brutal’ plan to cut nearly one in ten of its global workforce.

HSBC will wield the axe despite increasing its profits by 3pc to £7billion between January and June – equivalent to £40million a day.

Cuts: Banking giant HSBC will shed 30,000 posts, some of which could go at its UK HQ at Canary Wharf in London (pictured)

The cull is likely to be a grim 
portent of the pain to come with a raft of Britain’s biggest lenders 
expected to shed thousands of staff over the coming months.

Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and 
Lloyds Banking Group could all accelerate cost-cutting plans alongside 
results for the first half of 2011 this week.

This could spell bad news for the 
government’s plans to rein in the deficit, which lean heavily on a 
resurgence in tax receipts from big businesses. HSBC has already cut 
5,000 staff around the world since the start of the year, including 700 
in Britain.

Yesterday it warned that a further 25,000 will go from a 296,000-strong workforce in a bid to reduce overheads.

Its 52,000 UK-based workers will have
to endure months of agony after the bank refused to spell out how many 
jobs will be slashed in the UK because of uncertainties surrounding 
financial reforms.

If the bank implemented a 10 per cent reduction of staff in Britain, it would mean 5,000 people could lose their jobs.

Cull: A fresh wave of job losses is poised to sweep the banking sector as HSBC prepares to reveal plans to cull around 10,000 staff worldwide as part of a stringent cost-cutting plan

HSBC has 1,290 branches and around 52,000 staff in the UK.

Jobs are being lost across the banking sector, with Credit Suisse recently announcing 2,000 job losses and UBS also warning of cutbacks.

Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland are already involved in major restructuring programmes which have seen thousands of jobs axed.

The latest purge in the industry comes as firms look to offset a sharp drop-off in trading volumes caused by the eurozone crisis and American debt deadlock.

HSBC have refused to be drawn on how many staff here would be affected.

Chairman Douglas Flint said it was 
‘very difficult’ to predict how many British staff would be jettisoned 
until the Independent Commission on Banking delivers its final 
recommendations next month.

His reticence angered HSBC staff. 
David Fleming of the Unite union condemned the ‘brutal restructuring’. 
He said: ‘The employees being hit by these extensive cuts were in no way
responsible for the banking crisis, yet it is these staff many of whom 
are low paid, who are having to pay for the bank’s recovery.’

Banks have staged an increasingly 
strident lobbying campaign against the ICB’s proposed reforms, which 
could force banks to erect firewalls around their High Street operations
in a bid to prevent future taxpayer bailouts.

Mr Flint warned that the so-called 
ring-fencing plans could ‘constrain the supply of credit to the real 
economy and contribute to sub-par economic growth.’

Even before the safeguards come, small firms are finding it difficult to obtain affordable credit from high street banks.

HSBC made new loans totalling 
£5.6billion to small and medium-term enterprises in the first half. At 
the current rate, HSBC will fall short of the £11.7billion SME target 
set by the Government.

Weak revenue growth in Western Europe
and the UK reflected the tough economic situation in the region, HSBC said . UK revenue fell slightly to £2.82billion from £2.84billion.

HSBC said 5,000 of the planned job cuts had already taken place, which included 700 in the UK that were announced in June as a result of regulatory changes to the way financial advice is allowed to be given.

Caveat: HSBC's CEO Stuart Gulliver said the 30,000 job losses do not include future expansion plans

HSBC said it is on course to meet its
targets for business lending agreed with the Government under Project 
Merlin, having lent £22.7billion, but the group was behind on small firm
lending with £5.6billion advanced in the first six months against a 
full year goal of £11.7billion.

Mortgage lending rose by 35 per cent 
to £6.7billion with HSBC's share of the UK mortgage market at a record 
of nearly 11per cent.

Shares in the bank rose by 4 per cent as analysts said the figures were an impressive start to the week's bank reporting season.

He added that HSBC's global 
diversification is not necessarily matched by the other UK banks while 
the bad loan figures have reduced impressively.

HSBC's announcement kicked off the results season, which is expected to provide a snapshot of a gruelling start to 2011.

Barclays,
Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland are all also expected 
to reveal a drop in profits in their interim updates over the coming 
week.

The main focus is 
likely to be on progress with cost-cutting after boss Stuart Gulliver 
unveiled a multi-billion dollar savings programme earlier this year 
which will cut back on retail operations in some parts of the world and 
instead focus on fast growing markets in Mexico and Turkey.

It has already seen an announcement 
today that HSBC will sell just under half of its 470 retail banking 
branches in the U.S. to First Niagara Bank for around $1 billion.

Most of the 195 branches to be sold are in New York Upstate region, while six are in Connecticut.

Six others are in New York State - four in northern Westchester County, and two in Putnam County.

The payment protection insurance 
mis-selling scandal; planned ring-fencing of retail banking operations 
as proposed by the Independent Commission on Banking; and a volatile 
global economic climate have all affected the accounts of the four 
lenders.

Taxpayer-backed 
Lloyds and RBS have seen their shares plunge 30 per cent and 17 per cent
respectively in the last six months alone, while Barclays' shares have 
plummeted 26 per cent and HSBC has lost 14 per cent.

Barclays,
which reports tomorrow, is expected to reveal a 24 per cent drop in 
reported profits to £1.8 billion, according to broker Seymour Pierce.

Taxpayer-backed
Lloyds Banking Group is expected to report pre-tax profits of £1 
billion on Thursday, a steep reduction on the £1.6 billion reported a 
year earlier.

Royal Bank of
Scotland closes the week with its results on Friday, which are expected
to reveal £611 million in reported profits, down 19 per cent on the 
previous year, Seymour Pierce said.
