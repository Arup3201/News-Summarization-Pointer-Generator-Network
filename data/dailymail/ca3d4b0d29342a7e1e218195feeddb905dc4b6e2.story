Stunned: Paul Seyfang was horrified after a thief stole his bike

A man who was knocked off his bike which was then stolen has spoken about his shock that someone could be so cruel while he lay dazed in the road.

Cyclist Paul Seyfang said he thought he was going to die when he was hit by a car while riding home from work in Chelmsford, Essex.

But rather than stop and help the 65-year-old, an opportunistic thief took the opportunity to pedal off on his Â£2,000 Marin mountain bike.

Reliving the horrifying moment, he 
said: 'I was travelling to my home when the car pulled out without 
looking in my direction. I honestly thought I was going to die.

'The car was bearing down 
on me and there's that moment when you can't help but think "that's it 
for me".

'It hit me square-on and the middle of his bumper forced me and my bike to the ground and the car eventually came to a stop.

'It went over my legs as far as my knees, but thankfully he did brake enough to stop before I was killed.

'Afterwards
 I was talking to the car driver and was in a bit of a daze and it was 
then that I turned round to see that my bike had gone.

'I was stood there bleeding and that was when I realised that a very despicable person had stolen it.'

The married father-of-three believes a rail passenger may have been responsible as a train had only just pulled into the nearby 
station and dozens of people came past moments after the accident.

Crime scene: Mr Seyfang was hit by an oncoming car in Chelmsford. The scene of the accident soon became the subject of a police investigation into the theft of his bike

He added: 'It all happened within a minute and there was no way that the thief did not realise that I had been in an accident.

'My
 bike was damaged and I was stood there speaking the with driver who had
 knocked me off, so they knew what had happened but just thought "that's
 an easy opportunity to get a new bike".

'I never expected that I would have to lock up my bike after an accident and even the police officers who attended said they had never seen anything like this before.'

Mr Seyfang suffered bruising to his kidney and spleen, cuts to his right leg and arm and pain in his back.

He also banged his head and has had to have regular GP visits following the accident, which occurred at about 5.30pm on August 15.

Essex Police is investigating the theft.
