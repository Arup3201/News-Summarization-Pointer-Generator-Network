Newborn baby Arlo Roach strikes a claim to be Britain's youngest football fan after he was taken to his first match just 30 minutes after he was discharged from hospital.

Arlo's father Anthony Roach, 39, was delighted when his fiancee gave birth four days early as it meant he could take the baby to see Torquay United's last match before the team was relegated from the football league.

Following Arlo's release from Torbay Hospital yesterday, Mr Roach drove straight to the match at the Devon club's Plainmoor ground - stopping only to drop fiancee Rebekah Bancroft off at home.

Proud dad: Football mad Anthony Roach took his baby Arlo to see Torquay United play just 30 minutes after the newborn was discharged from hospital

After his birth at 8.08pm on Friday night, little Arlo was discharged from hospital 15 minutes after the game kicked-off, but 
thanks to his father's dedication he managed to make it in time for the 
second half.

'I drove Rebekah home and made sure she was comfortable then I got off to the ground as quick as I could,' said Mr Roach.

'Luckily my boss had an executive box at the stadium, so I didn't have to try and get Arlo and his carrycot through the turnstiles.

'We only managed to arrive at half time but thankfully that meant he only had to watch one of the three goals we let in.'

Mr Roach, who only lives a long free kick away from the Torquay 
United ground, added: 'There was no point in taking the car - it would 
have taken longer to find a parking space.

'So I walked to the ground, just like I always do, with Arlo in his carry cot.'

Arlo is Mr Roach's first child, although Ms Bancroft has two daughters from a previous relationship - Courtney, nine and Summer, seven.

The couple have been together two years and are engaged to be married.

Mr Roach added: 'Although I can't get Rebekah interested in football, the girls already go to home and away matches with me.

'I also am secretary and coach of a ladies football team and the girls come to watch them as well.'

Torquay United, who had already been relegated, lost 3-0 to Wycombe Wanderers, saving the visitors from the drop.

Mr Roach, an insurance manager, said: 'The mathematics of it all went over Arlo's head a little, but I'll be able to tell him all about it when he gets older.

'It would make a great first birthday present for him if United to get back into the League next year, but there's no way of knowing.

'I guess at least he can say he's seen a League match at Plainmoor now.'

Joy: Wycombe fans were thrilled after their team managed to avoid relegation, although Mr Roach says he hopes Torquay will be back in the league next year

Ms Bancroft is not a football fan but said she was quite happy for little Arlo, who weighed a healthy 9lbs 1oz, to be swept off to the stadium before he had even been inside his own home. 

'We didn't even take him out of his baby seat. I went indoors with the girls and Anthony took Arlo off to the match,' she said.

She added that after a 29 hour labour it was nice to have a bit of peace and quiet to relax.

'But he was lucky to get Arlo there in time at all,' she said.

'He wasn't due to be born for another four days.

'Once he came early, I knew how important it was for Anthony to get him to the match before Torquay dropped out of the football league.'

Even little Arlo's name has a football theme behind it. Mr Roach explained that the name was made up of his initials, AR, and the shirt number, 10, from his playing days.
