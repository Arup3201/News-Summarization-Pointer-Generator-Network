Building a boat that travels at over 20 knots could now take
less time than it does to make a cup of tea.

The flat-pack foldable ‘Quickboat' takes 60 seconds
to build by a two person team.

Deryck Graham, the managing director of Quickboats, has
reportedly said that one person with a beer in hand could build the boat in
three minutes even with friends around to distract them.

The flat-pack folding Quickboat can be unpacked in 60 seconds. The design is due to be unveiled at the 2013 Sydney International Boat Show

When not in use, the Quickboat can simply be hung up on a wall, placed on a shelf or stored under the bed

The parts for Quickboat are assembled by clicking into
place. Once constructed, the fibreglass and Kevlar boat is 3.7 metres long and
1.7 metres wide.

Due to be unveiled at the 2013 Sydney International Boat
Show later this week, the boat can fit four adults and travel in enclosed
waters with 9.8hp.

The entire boat packs down into two bags, with one bag
measuring less than 4 metres and weighing a 36kg.

The second bag weighs 18kg and measures 1.5 metres making it
simple to carry the boat from the car.

When not in use, the Quickboat, which is currently being
sold at around £2,850, can be hung up on a wall, placed on a shelf or stored
under the bed.

According to the Austrialian firm, the boat
cuts out registration costs if powered at less than 5hp which makes the vessel
ideal for recreational skippers.

Quickboats insists its design is safe as is made from
advanced composites such as high-end fibreglass and Kevlar and designed to
function like other traditional small boats.

Several International Aid agencies have already expressed
interest in using the Quickboat for flood relief and rescue operations.

Foldable boats have been gaining popularity in recent years.

Last year two design students from London created a foldable
boat based on the ones created using origami.

The full-size vessel is folded from an 8ft by 5ft piece of
plastic and can be transformed from a flat sheet to a rowing boat by a single
person in two minutes using only three components.

Another model of the £800 'Foldboat' can be folded up and
carried in a backpack.
