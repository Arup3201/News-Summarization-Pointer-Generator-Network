Eight primary school children were rushed to hospital and more than 20 were treated by paramedics after a lorry slammed into the side of their school bus as they travelled home from a carol concert.

The 40-seater bus was pulling out of a side street across a busy road  on Tuesday afternoon when it was hit by a HGV, leaving the side of the coach crumpled and windows smashed. 

The incident took place as the pupils from St Nicholas Church of England Middle School in Pinyin, Worcestershire, were travelling through Pershore after attending a carol concert at Pershore Abbey.

The bus was pulling out of a side street across a busy road just after 3pm on Tuesday when it was hit by a HGV, leaving the side of the coach crumpled and windows smashed

Eight of the children and the driver  were taken to hospital. One was taken on a spinal board after complaining of neck pain.

The driver of the bus was also taken to Worcester Royal Hospital. The other 19 children were checked over by medics at a private house nearby and were reunited with their parents at the school.

Three ambulances, as well as two rapid response paramedics, had been called to the scene. There was also a paramedic area support officer, a doctor and the Air Ambulance.

The children, all between nine and 11 years-old, were travelling back to their school when the crash happened on the B4084.

The road was closed for the rest of the day and police were asking motorists to avoid the area where possible.

Parents were alerted to the incident by text messages sent from the school and the remaining uninjured students were taken back to St Nicholas on a mini bus where they were reunited with their parents.

An ambulance team were at the school briefing parents on a one-to-one basis on the aftercare of their children.

In a statement on its website, the school said that all the children from the school were 'doing well' and were back in school today.

The executive headteacher Andrew Best said there had been a special school assembly held this morning and that it was a 'blessing' that no one was seriously injured.  

It said: 'The children, from our school, who were taken to hospital yesterday, with minor cuts and bruises after their bus was involved in a collision with a lorry in Pershore, are all doing well and have been back in school today.

'Nineteen other pupils were taken to a private house nearby, where they were assessed by local doctors before being transported back to school. An ambulance team were at the school briefing parents on a one-to-one basis on the aftercare of their children.'

Mr Best added that he wanted to thank the emergency services for their 'swift and very professional work'.

He said. 'Everyone's priority was to ensure that the children and staff involved received the best care possible. 

Nine people - eight children and the driver - were taken to hospital, one on a spinal board after complaining of neck pain

'We contacted all parents of injured children by telephone and maintained contact with other parents about the incident by text.

'The remaining uninjured pupils were taken back to school in our mini bus where they were reunited with their parents.

'And this morning we have held a special assembly in school for all children and staff about the incident.

'It was a blessing that no one was seriously injured yesterday, but it has been a big shock to us all.

'Two counsellors are in school all day today, to talk to pupils affected and any parents are invited to come into school and discuss any issues as well.'  

A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: 'We were called to reports of a large number of patients following a collision between a coach and a lorry.

'Over 40 children and adults were on the coach at the time of the crash with the children believed to be between nine and 11 years old.

'A total of 27 school children were assessed away from the road side.

'One boy, complaining of neck pain, was treated at the scene and immobilised with a neck collar and spinal board. He was transferred to Worcester Royal Hospital.

'Three further children and the man who was driving the coach all received treatment at the scene for minor injuries and were conveyed to the same hospital.

'The remaining children were all checked over by the doctor and ambulance crews and were discharged on scene.

'The children were transported back to school on two separate minibuses, where a number of ambulance staff joined them to give advice to their parents who had come to collect them.

'The lorry driver was uninjured in the incident.'

The crash follows another school bus which overturned in Hereford last month, while it was taking 53 pupils to school.

The coach overturned and slid 10ft (3.1m) down an embankment on November 10 and students had to scramble out of windows to get free of the wreckage.

West Mercia police said no arrests had been made.
