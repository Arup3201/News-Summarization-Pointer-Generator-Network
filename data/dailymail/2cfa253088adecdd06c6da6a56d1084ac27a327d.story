David Moyes conceded his first defeat as Real Sociedad coach was thoroughly deserved as Villarreal ran out 4-0 winners - and admitted the result could have been even worse.

Former Manchester United boss Moyes had seen Sociedad pick up four points from his opening two Primera Division games in the hotseat while drawing with Real Oviedo in the Copa del Rey last 32 first leg.

The Basque side had also not conceded a goal during that three-match unbeaten run, but both those records came to an emphatic end at El Madrigal on Sunday as Villarreal scored four times in the final 27 minutes through Bruno Soriano, Denis Cheryshev and a double from Moi Gomez.

Moyes had few complaints about the result, saying in his press conference: 'It could have been more, we could have lost more goals. 

We made some terrible mistakes, defensively bad mistakes, especially with the third and fourth goals.

'I don't think the first goal was a free-kick, I think it was the wrong decision to give the free-kick, but the best team won.

'In the first 20 minutes of the game we had some opportunities, but not enough tonight. 

'We knew we were coming to a difficult ground and we wanted to be hard to beat, and for 50-60 minutes we were, but in the end (it was) not good enough.'

Moyes, whose side have slipped to 14th in the Primera Division, had nothing to chastise his players about with regards their attitude, but says they need to do much better with the ball.

When asked about the performances of his midfielders, Moyes said: 'I think the players have worked very hard, their effort has been fantastic. The biggest disappointment is that they haven't passed the ball better.

'We need to compete better than we're doing, but their effort has been fantastic, but we're giving the ball away too much.'

With the winter transfer window opening soon, Moyes will have the chance to bring in some of his own players, but the Scot said he has not spoken with the club about any reinforcements yet.

He said: 'Not yet, I'm still assessing the team. We need a little more time to assess it, but we have to quickly get to a better level than we showed tonight. 

'Villarreal are a good Spanish team and we have to try and get to that level.'

Sociedad, who are three points above the relegation zone, face arch-rivals Athletic Bilbao at home on Sunday.
