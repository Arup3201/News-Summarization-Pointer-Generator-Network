A pilot had an amazing escape when his plane landed nose-down in a hedge,  leaving him hanging upside down inside.

But Alan Bray walked away with only a grazed thumb despite being left trapped in the cockpit for 40 minutes, held in by his harness, as witnesses raised the alarm.

In true ‘Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines’ spirit, the 59-year-old said afterwards: ‘I’m a bit sore. The pain is simply from the straps. You don’t get scared at the time, you just do what you trained to do.

‘You spend all that time doing practice forced landings, it is just instinctive.’

Alan Bray had a miraculous escape from a plane crash in Warwickshire, emerging from the aircraft embedded upside down in a hedgerow with only a graze on his thumb

The pilot was left trapped in the small two-seater plane, hanging by his harness in the cockpit for forty minutes while shocked residents called the emergency services

More worrying than the crash itself 
was being trapped in the plane, he said. ‘I didn’t want to let go. If I 
moved I didn’t know what would happen to the thing.’

Mr Bray, who has ten years’ flying 
experience, tried to make an emergency landing in the two-seater plane 
when its engine had problems shortly after take-off from Wellesbourne 
Airfield in Warwickshire.

But as he tried to glide it into a 
field the engine cut out. After briefly touching down, the light 
aircraft smashed through a fence and on to a private road, before 
flipping over on its nose and into the hedge.

He was forced to attempt a crash landing in a field at Pastures Farm, near the village of Loxley, after what is believed to be an engine failure

Apart from a 'bloody thumb', Mr Bray, who has been flying for ten years, suffered no serious injuries in the crash, and even came back later that day to wrestle his aircraft out of the hedge

Mr Bray even returned to the scene later the same day to help wrestle the aircraft from the hedge

All that stopped the plane from turning over entirely was a power line that its tail got caught on.

Paul Van Der Heyden, who lives close 
to Loxley village, near Stratford-upon-Avon, called the emergency 
services after hearing the crash on Tuesday morning and spotting the 
plane in its unusual resting place.

Another resident, Tori Danle, stayed with Mr Bray, of Rugby, while they waited for firemen to free him.

The Midlands Air Ambulance also came, touching down in the same field Mr Bray had tried to land in.

After he was freed, he was given the 
all-clear by paramedics. But the plane, which he part-owns with five 
friends, will probably have to be written off.

The only thing that saved him from flipping over entirely was an electric line that the plane's tail got caught on
