Prosecutors in Indiana have dropped 
charges against a woman whose murder conviction in her son's 1995 death 
was overturned, but they say the case isn't closed.

The Indiana Court of Appeals ordered a
new trial for Kristine Bunch in March after finding that evidence used 
to convict her was outdated, weak and wrongly withheld from the defense.

She was released on bond in August, 
but prosecutors said then that they intended to retry her. Deputy 
Prosecutor Doug Brown said Tuesday that that is still the case. He says 
the investigation is still open and his office intends to refile charges

1995 arrest: The original trial heard that Bunch poured kerosene in the bedroom of her son and the living room of their mobile home before setting it ablaze

Prosecutors asked a judge to dismiss 
the charges Monday, saying their investigation needs more time. The 
judge granted the motion.

Bunch, 38, was sentenced to 60 years in prison in 1996 after a jury convicted her of pouring kerosene in the bedroom of her three-year-old son, Tony, and setting it on fire.

But scientific breakthroughs and new evidence cast doubt on the original conviction.

Bunch was greeted by her overjoyed mother Susan Hubbard, 58, and her 16-year-old son, Trenton, after she was released from prison in Greensburg, Indiana, in August.

Taking in her first breaths of freedom in 16 years, a jubilant Bunch said she looked forward to doing
the everyday things that most people take for granted, like shopping, 
eating out, and using the Internet, which she had never seen.

‘I can learn how to Facebook,’ she said. ‘All my friends tell me they're on Facebook.’

Victim: Tony was three-years-old when he died from carbon monoxide poisoning

She was released after the Indiana 
Court of Appeals ruled that the evidence used to convict her was 
outdated, weak and wrongly withheld from the defense.

A Decatur County judge granted her $5,000 cash bail at the suggestion of prosecutors.

On June 30, 1995, firefighters were called to Bunch's Greensburg mobile home to find it fully engulfed in flames.

She was standing outside and told crews she tried to get to her son, but the flames were too hot.

The body of the three-year-old was found huddled between the ashes of a burned bed and wall in a bedroom.

The original trial heard that Bunch 
poured kerosene in the bedroom of her son and the living room of their 
mobile home before setting it ablaze.

No clear motive was ever established, but prosecutors said Bunch, of Columbus, Indiana,
had asked a friend to take custody of the boy about a year before the 
fire so she could ‘get away from it all’ and that she had made 
inconsistent statements about the blaze.

Chicago
attorney Ron Safer told WTLX.com that the new evidence made it 
impossible for the fire to have happened the way the state alleged and 
that tests were incorrect.

In actuality, tests showed Tony died from carbon monoxide poisoning. 
Had the fire been started in his room, as it was alleged, the child 
would have died of burns from the fire rather than smoke inhalation.

Bunch likened her experiences to a nightmare that wouldn't end and said
that though she was in a state of shock about being released, she was 
joyful that she has the chance to prove the conviction was a mistake.

'I
haven't been by myself,' she said. 'I had a family that stood by me. I 
had people that believed in me and stepped up. And you can't receive 
blessings like that and be bitter.'

In prison: Bunch earned her GED and a college degree. She said she plans to go to law school. She wants to work in criminal law, representing inmates who have been wrongfully convicted

‘It
was horrible, but I knew if I held on to my faith that justice would 
prevail. The truth usually has a way of coming out,’ Bunch's 
mother said.

Bunch said a prison ministry helped her maintain her faith while she was in prison.

‘I knew it was going to work out in the end,’ she said.

While locked up, Bunch earned her GED and a college degree. She said she plans to go to law school if acquitted.

She wants to work in criminal law, representing inmates who have been wrongfully convicted.

‘There's still a lot of work to be done. There's still a lot of people in my situation,’ Bunch said.

But of all the technological changes 
since she was last out of prison, Bunch said that cellphones, which have 
evolved from unwieldy boxes with thick antennas to sleek little 
machines, impressed her the most.

‘I'm amazed by the cellphones,’ she said.
