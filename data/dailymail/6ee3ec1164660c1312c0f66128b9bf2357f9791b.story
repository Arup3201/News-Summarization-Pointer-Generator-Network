Hollywood actor John Cusack is the latest supporter to visit WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in his continued stay at the Ecuadorian Embassy.

The American star joined US activist Daniel Ellsberg and Indian-born author and activist Arundhati Roy for a meeting inside the embassy in London.

Assange has avoided being extradited to Sweden by taking shelter in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London since 2012.

WikiLeaks said the three were marking the fourth anniversary of Mr Assange being in 'detention' without charge, as well as 'commenting on the round the clock police presence' outside the embassy.

The Australian has been granted political asylum by Ecuador but faces arrest if he leaves the embassy.

He is wanted for questioning in Sweden over allegations of sex offences - which he denies - but he fears he will be transferred to the United States.

Mr Assange believes if he is sent to Sweden he will be extradited to the US, where he could face 35 years in prison for publishing on WikiLeaks classified documents related to US activities in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Last month a Swedish appeals court upheld the detention order on Assange, dismissing a challenge by the WikiLeaks founder.

Confirming a ruling by a lower court, the Svea appeals court said there is no reason to lift the detention order just because it cannot be enforced at the moment. 

The court also criticised the prosecutors, who have declined Assange's offer to be questioned in London, for not considering 'alternative avenues' to move the investigation forward.

Assange hasn't been formally indicted in Sweden, but is wanted for questioning by police about allegations of sexual misconduct and rape involving two women he met during a visit to the Scandinavian country in 2010. 

He denies the allegations. 

In October MailOnline reported Assange fears he is being bugged at the embassy.

Last year a covert listening device was found behind a plug socket in the ambassador’s office, but security experts described it as rudimentary and unlikely to have been the work of police or the security services.
