Roger Federer has entered the final 16 of the US Open after coming from a set down to beat Marcel Granollers at Flushing Meadows.

A two-hour interruption in the opening set due to severe storms in New York saw the World No 3 leave court trailing  5-2 to the man 39 places adrift of him in the rankings.

Federer used the break to gather his composure, though, and proved too much for his Spanish counterpart as he orchestrated three consecutive 6-1 sets to breeze beyond the third round.

Champ: The five-time US Open winner has reached the final 16 of the competition after a hard-earned win

Granollers may feel the delay hindered him after the 28-year-old started surprisingly dominant against the man five years his senior. 

Granollers failed to maintain his early advantage, though, and could do little to stop Federer winning 20 out of 24 games in a tennis masterclass at the Arthur Ashe Stadium.

It was a forehand winner that meant Federer won the match 4-6, 6-1, 6-1, 6-1, and the five-time US Open champion must now turn to an imminent fourth round in the borough of Queens.

World No 90 Adrian Mannarino or No 19 Roberto Bautista Agut are set to face each other in the third round to determine who Federer will meet next.

Return: Federer won 20 out of 24 games after play was suspended for severe weather in New York

Broken: Granollers may feel the delay hindered his performance after storming to the opening set 6-2

Out: Granollers started impressively but ultimately succumbed to Federer's skills and lost three sets all 6-1

Crowd favourite: Federer is to face either World No 90 Adrian Mannarino or No 19 Roberto Bautista Agut next
