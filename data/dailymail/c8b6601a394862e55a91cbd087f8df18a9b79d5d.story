Defiant: The star said he will 'continue to co-operate with police' after detectives swooped on his £3.1million apartment in Berkshire last month

Sir Cliff Richard has vowed to 'clear his name' after thanking fans for supporting him in his second statement since sex assault claims were made against him.

The star, 73, has reiterated that the historic allegations are 'completely false' but said he will 'continue to co-operate with police' during the investigation

Detectives swooped on his £3.1million apartment in Berkshire last month amid accusations he sexually assaulted a schoolboy at a Christian rally almost three decades ago.

Police launched a probe after receiving a report that a teenager under the age of 16 was attacked in Sheffield at an event held by American evangelist Billy Graham in 1985.

In a statement on Facebook, Sir Cliff said: 'Hi everyone, this is just a brief message to thank all of you who have shown support, including those in the Press.

'I wanted to let you know that I'm doing ok and it goes without saying that I fully intend to clear my name.

'Just to be absolutely clear, the allegation is completely false and I will continue to cooperate with the police should they wish to speak to me again.

'Once again...many thanks!'

It is the second statement he has made in relation to the investigation having first denied the accusations on Facebook on August 14 

Then, he wrote: 'For many months I have been aware of allegations against me of historic impropriety which have been circulating online. The allegations are completely false.

'Up until now I have chosen not to dignify the false allegations with a response, as it would just give them more oxygen.

'However, the police attended my apartment in Berkshire today without notice, except it would appear to the press.

'I am not presently in the UK but it goes without saying that I will cooperate fully should the police wish to speak to me.

'Beyond stating that today's allegation is completely false it would not be appropriate to say anything further until the police investigation has concluded.' 

Detectives swooped on the apartment while Sir Cliff was on holiday in the Algarve, Portugal. Officers spent five hours inside the property searching for evidence.

Second statement: The singer thanked his supporters and reiterated that the allegation is 'completely false'

Earlier this week, one of the country's most senior police officers was accused of 'sheer incompetence' over his handling of the raid, which was aired live on the BBC.

The corporation and South Yorkshire police clashed in Parliament over how TV reporters were able to film live aerial shots of the search last month.

The chief constable of South Yorkshire Police David Crompton said the BBC put his force in 'a very difficult position' after confronting officers with leaked information about the planned search in connection with allegations of a historic sexual assault.

Mr Crompton told MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee that his force was convinced that the broadcaster would run a story about the investigation without some kind of deal. Committee MP Julian Huppert said it was a 'rather remarkable blackmail attempt'.

But the BBC flatly rejected the accusation and claimed they would have pulled the story if the police had asked.
