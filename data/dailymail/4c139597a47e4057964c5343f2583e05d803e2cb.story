Many British singletons struggle to find love, but for many men in China the task seems insurmountable, due to a severe shortage of women.

Thirty years of China's one-child policy, coupled with a cultural preference for male children, led to mass abortions of girls. As a result, by the year 2020 it's predicted there will be 24 million men with no partner.

Li Dongmin, 39, and desperate to find a wife, epitomises the plight of China's unwanted bachelors. He is a migrant labourer from a tiny village 1000 miles from Beijing.

He works as a cook in the capital, and 
sleeps in a dormitory to save money for a new house back home, on a 
salary of just £300 a month.

Despite his best efforts, he has failed to find love.

The latest Channel 4 Unreported World 
sees Reporter Marcel Theroux and director Frankie Fathers join some of 
China's many millions of male lonely hearts on their search for a wife, 
and meet some of the ‘Love Hunters’ working to find rich single men the ideal bride.

It follows two characters that represent the contrasting paths to love in modern China.

In the village where Li Dongmin grew up, his mother weeps as her neighbours laugh at her son's inability to find a bride.

Theroux accompanies Dongmin to one of Beijing's unofficial marriage markets in the Temple of Heaven Park, where parents tout for potential suitors for their adult children.

Dongmin suffers a stream of rejections from openly contemptuous parents: he's too poor, he’s insufficiently educated, and he has no property in Beijing.

Unreported World also follows 30-year-old Rong Na, an elegant and vivacious ‘love hunter’, employed by an agency called Diamond Love and Marriage to find wives for some of China's richest men.

Rong Na combs Beijing's shopping malls for attractive women, picking potential wives for a client she refers to as Mr X, who’s very rich and can afford to be extremely choosy.

She declines some women for being ‘too average,’ ‘too common,’ ‘too short,’ having eyes that are ‘too droopy’ or for not walking ‘like a university graduate’.

Pale skin is deemed the height of beauty, as are Westernised facial features, such as a small pointy chin.

Women who make Rong Na's shortlist are invited for further vetting at her office, where they’re examined in more depth.

Her colleagues are witheringly frank about one woman: ‘skin not white enough; features not elegant enough.’

They also rate the women on their ‘books’ into categories A, B, or C depending on their qualities.

A number of beautiful and seemingly pleasant young women are interviewed during the programme, but not a single one is classed as category ‘A’.
