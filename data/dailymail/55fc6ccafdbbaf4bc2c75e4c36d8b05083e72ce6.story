If you've ever wanted to have Daniel Craig's steely gaze or Angelina Jolie's sultry stare, a new laser treatment could be the answer.

A Californian company says it hopes to offer a $5,000 (£3,400) medical procedure that can transform any eye colour to blue, permanently.

The technique, which is currently undergoing clinical trials, works by using something known as 'scavenger cells' to digest and remove the pigment from the iris surface.

The technique, which is currently undergoing clinical trials, works by using something known as 'scavenger cells' to digest and remove the pigment from the iris surface. A specific laser frequency passes through the clear cornea of the eye, before it is selectively absorbed by the dark pigment covering the iris

The procedure applies a computer-guided, low-energy laser to the iris to disrupt the brown pigment.

A specific laser frequency passes through the clear cornea of the eye, before it is selectively absorbed by the dark pigment covering the iris.

This causes the body to 'initiate a natural and gradual tissue-removal process. Once the tissue is removed, the patient's natural blue eye is revealed,' explains the website

By removing the pigment, light can enter small fibres in the eye. When the light scatters, it only reflects back the shortest wavelengths, which appears blue.

'Under every brown eye is a blue eye,' Dr Gregg Homer, chairman and chief scientific officer at Strōma Medical said.

'The only difference between them is that a brown eye has a thin layer of pigment covering the blue iris.'

According to Strōma Medical, the process takes 30 seconds, and around two weeks eyes become blue. 

So far, 17 patients in Mexico and 20 in Costa Rica have undergone the treatment. The company hopes to trial a total of 100 patients over the next few years. .

Saj Khan, an ophthalmologist at the London Eye Hospital, told CNN that the procedure could clog up the eye's normal drainage channels.

This can in turn cause the pressure inside the eye to go up,' he said.

'If that happens significantly enough, for long enough, it's how patients develop glaucoma,' he said.

'We were concerned about this issue right from the start, so it was the first issue we tested and measured in our initial pre-clinical and clinical studies,' the company wrote on their site.

'Thus far, pigmentary glaucoma has not proved to be a problem in our pre-clinical or clinical studies.'

Dr Mark Korolkiewicz, an optometrist and clinical services director at Ultralase, a nationwide laser vision correction specialist, says that there are fundamental differences between the Stroma laser procedure and corrective laser eye surgery.

The basic rule of thumb is that as soon as you go inside the eye with a laser, you can cause more damage,’ he says.

‘We only use lasers on the cornea, the surface of the eye. This new treatment involves using a laser inside the eye.’

'Our procedure is limited to the treatment of stromal pigment,' Dr Homer told DailyMail.com.

'It does not dislodge or even contact any of the the "iris pigment epithelium" or IPE on the back side of the iris. 

'In addition, our procedure does not actually remove any pigment.

'The proof, as they say, is in the pudding. We are now well into our clinical trials, and thus far, there has been no intraocular pressure increase in any subject.' 

But it may be the moral question which gives people most pause for thought.

Dr Homer, who has Jewish roots himself, rejects he is promoting blue eyes over brown.

‘I’ve heard the eugenics remark a few times, but I don’t understand it. Is the charge that there is something racist about giving people the option to have blue eyes?’
