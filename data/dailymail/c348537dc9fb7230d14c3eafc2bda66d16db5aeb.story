Celtic will again have their own mini-winter break after requesting a postponement of their Scottish Premiership fixture with St Johnstone on January 5.

Celtic will not play between January 5 and their trip to Hamilton on January 17 after invoking their right to have a one-game break in January.

Celtic did the same last season by postponing a game against Kilmarnock until later in January.

A club statement read: 'Premiership clubs are permitted to request one fixture postponement at the beginning of the season, and one in January.

'Ronny Deila's side will have played 35 competitive games by the time they've faced Kilmarnock at Rugby Park on January 5, and the Celtic manager wants to take the opportunity for his side to have a short mid-season break and training camp before resuming their quest for silverware in the remaining months of the season.

'At the recent fans' forum at Celtic Park, the issue of fixture cancellations was raised, with fans asking for notification at the earliest opportunity.

Celtic manager Ronny Deila celebrates with the away support at the full-time whistle after his side's victory 

'And so, following these discussions, the club is announcing the postponement of the St Johnstone game now in order to give supporters proper notice.'

No new date has been fixed for the Celtic park contest.
