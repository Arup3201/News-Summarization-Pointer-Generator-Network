A grieving father has been banned from the GP surgery he has attended for more than 60 years after raising concerns about GPs who failed to spot his son’s deadly brain tumour.

Last week Malcolm Buckley, 62, spoke of his devastation that his son, Chris, 34, died of a brain tumour after being told his symptoms were caused by depression.

He has now been left stunned after receiving a letter informing him he has a week to find a new doctor as his name is to be removed from the register at Robert Frew Medical Centre in Wickford, Essex.

Malcolm Buckley has been banned from the Robert Frew Medical Centre after going public about his concerns that his son could have received better treatment if he had not been repeatedly misdiagnosed

The shock move came just days after Mr Buckley raised concerns about three of doctors at the surgery who treated his son.

Mr Buckley said: ‘I’m convinced this is the direct result of me raising concerns about my son’s care in the local paper and the doctors clearly do not like any criticism.

‘People should be aware that if they complain about their GP, they could be struck off.

‘I have been at the surgery 62 years with no previous issues and could now struggle to find another practice.’

Mr Buckley claims he was given no warning of the removal - a move required by British Medical Association guidelines - and was handed ‘veiled threats’ about going to the press with his concerns.

The senior councillor at Basildon Borough Council was shocked when he received the letter which stated: ‘Robert Frew Medical Centre has asked contractor services to remove your name from its list of NHS patients.

‘If you are not accepted by another 
doctor then your name will be removed from your present doctor’s list on
July 16 when his responsibility for your treatment will cease.’

Mr Buckley’s son had seen three doctors 
at the surgery over a year who prescribed him with anti-depressants and 
sleeping tablets to deal with his developing symptoms.

It was not until Mr Buckley’s son lost the use of his hand that the tumour, which was the size of a tennis ball, was discovered following a trip to Basildon Hospital A&E.

Despite a four-hour emergency operation to remove the bulk of the tumour, he died on May 2 this year.

Taylor Wood Solicitors, speaking on behalf of Robert Frew Medical Centre, said: ‘The practice has removed Mr Buckley from its list because the doctor-patient relationship, based on trust and mutual respect, has broken down irretrievably.

‘The partners respected Mr Buckley’s right to complain - indeed we have continued to offer GP medical services throughout the complaints procedure.

‘Mr Buckley has articulated in no uncertain terms that he has no confidence in three doctors in the partnership.

‘The partners are on call in rotation and there may well be a situation when the only doctors available will be one or more of the three concerned.

‘Under these circumstances the 
practice believes it is in Mr Buckley’s best interest and that of the 
partnership that he register with another practice.’

Mr
Buckley’s son went to Robert Frew Surgery in Wickford, Essex, in 
December 2011 because he was struggling to talk and could not remember 
some words.

He visited the surgery with girlfriend Kelly McCain who had to speak for him because his speech had got so bad and was prescribed with antidepressant citalopram and sleeping tablets.

His condition worsened over the New Year and he saw another doctor who prescribed more antidepressants.

But by the end of January Mr Buckley was barely able to speak and he was referred to a mental health unit at Basildon Hospital.

But when he got to the mental health unit, staff were unable to understand him and he left.

When father and late mother, Sylvia Buckley, 59, noticed that he could not use his right hand they were told by NHS Direct to take him to A&E where the tumour was discovered.

He was transferred to Queen's Hospital, Romford, where drugs improved his speech but two months later his situation deteriorated rapidly and he died.

Malcolm Buckley believes his son may have received better treatment sooner if he had been properly assessed and diagnosed.

A practice spokesman speaking on behalf of Robert Frew Surgery said: 'Even though Mr Buckley has spoken publicly, we are unable to discuss confidential details of patient care.

'The GMC conducted a thorough investigation and made no recommendations for action. We offer our sincere condolences to the family.'
