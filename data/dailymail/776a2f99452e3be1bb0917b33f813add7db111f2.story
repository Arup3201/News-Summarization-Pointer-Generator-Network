London Fog has released its spring ad campaign featuring a debonair Neil Patrick Harris - just days before the actor is slated to host the Oscars for the first time.

The 41-year-old, who will make his hosting debut at the 87th annual Academy Awards on Sunday, channeled the old Hollywood film Singin' in the Rain as he modeled a selection of timeless pieces from the iconic US label's signature outerwear collection. 

In one of the newly released images, the How I Met Your Mother star did his best Gene Kelly impression, posing in a monochromatic gray suit and tie while resting a patterned umbrella on his shoulder.

Red carpet ready: Neil Patrick Harris, who is hosting this year's Oscars, modeled a tailored gray suit for London Fog's spring ads, which were released just days before Sunday's 87th annual Academy Awards

Another black and white shot shows Mr Harris in the same suit, but instead of standing, he is sitting on a leather chair with a herringbone jacket draped over his shoulders.

The actor also donned a tailored coat paired with a button-down shirt, a striped tie and a dark pair of denim for a modern take on a casual, yet classic look.

This is the second time Mr Harris has been the face of London Fog. 

Last year, he and his husband David Burtka, 39, who have two children – fraternal twins Harper and Gideon, posed together in their first ever fashion campaign for the label’s holiday ads.

The newlyweds, who married last September, filmed a behind-the-scenes video for the label, in which Mr Harris talked about his upcoming projects. 

'I am doing a little Oscar thing,' he told the cameras. 'The Oscars are at the end of February, so I will probably be in rehab in the Spring from exhaustion.'

'You should probably go now,' his husband joked. 

Mr Harris also added that he will be starting pre-production for his upcoming variety show. 

He noted: '[David and I] will be working a lot and probably wondering where our children are.'

Under pressure: Mr Harris also appeared on Ellen DeGeneres's show on Wednesday, where he discussed the the 'nightmare' of trying to top the star-studded Oscar selfie she had taken during last year's ceremony

Mr Harris also appeared on Ellen DeGeneres's show on Wednesday where the first time Oscars host confessed to 'having nightmares' about topping her performance at last year's ceremony.

'How do you beat the selfie that broke the Internet?' he asked of Ms DeGeneres's star-studded snapshot that was taken during the awards show. 

Mr Harris, who has hosted the Emmy and Tony awards, said it is tricky coming up with material for the Oscars that hasn't already been done. 

'I'm finding good jokes that we had that are funny and strong, then I'll watch a late-night talk show and they'll say the same joke,' he explained.

He later added: 'I just want everyone to stop talking until Monday!'
