Manal Mahmoud has agreed to leave the £1.25m property in affluent Fulham for a new home outside the area

A mother whose refugee family trashed a £1.25million rented house paid for by the taxpayer was told today she will be given a new taxpayer-funded property - but faces jail if her wayward children do not behave.

After pressure from Hammersmith and Fulham Council, Manal Mahmoud has agreed to leave the borough and signed a court order promising her seven children would clean up their act.

The agreement means the clan, branded the ‘family from hell’ by neighbours, will be given a new taxpayer-funded property after Hammersmith and Fulham Council acknowledged it had a ‘legal obligation’ to find them a new home.

By signing the undertaking, Ms Mahmoud could be jailed if she ‘or anyone living’ at her new property causes a nuisance.

But a hearing at West London County Court was told today the family could be moved out of the borough meaning the west London council would not be responsible for enforcing it.

The Palestinian family moved into the Victorian end-of-terrace home after it was given a £76,000 facelift and received thousands of pounds in housing benefit.

But they were branded the ‘family from hell’ by neighbours following months of antisocial behaviour at the property, where the driveway has been smashed up, doors are hanging off and rubbish and furniture have been dumped in the garden.

Taxpayers partially footed the bill for a
 new kitchen and roof along with decoration costs before the family 
moved in three years ago.

One of Ms Mahmoud’s sons, Ossama, 19, is in prison for drug-dealing and another, Ziad, was today forced to sign an anti- social behaviour agreement after terrorising neighbours by driving a motorbike up and down the street and doing wheelies.

Ms Mahmoud left West London County Court and has been told she could face jail if she or her family cause a nuisance in their new neighbourhood

District Judge Nicholson told Ms Mahmoud she faced prison if she could not control her family.

He told her: 'You are being asked to give an undertaking to the court. It is a promise to the court.

'If you break that undertaking, the 
London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham may apply to the court for your
 committal to prison.

'It 
is a promise not to cause a nuisance yourself or any annoyance or 
disturbance to your neighbours. You have to ensure that anyone visiting 
or living with you is not likewise going to cause a nuisance.

'Ziad your son has signed an anti-social behaviour agreement.'

The family’s barrister, who refused to give his name, said Ms Mahmoud understood the serious nature of the order.

He
 said: 'My client is offering an undertaking to the court and it is on 
the basis that she’s promising to comply with the terms of her tenancy.

'Legal obligation': Hammersmith and Fulham council will find the family a new property as they agreed to leave the area

'The significant paragraph is allowing visitors or those living with her to cause a nuisance.

'I’ve explained the significance of that and the potential, if there is a breach, of imprisonment.'

But he said if the family were moved 
away from the borough that would be the 'end of the matter' as a 
cash-strapped council would not waste resources monitoring a family in 
another locality.

Hammersmith and Fulham have now agreed to find them a new home elsewhere. 

'They
 [Hammersmith and Fulham] have accepted that they need to do that and 
that is within the duties under the Housing Act 1966,' the barrister 
said.

Councillor Greg 
Smith, deputy leader of Hammersmith and Fulham, said he was 'committed' 
to ensuring the family were moved outside of the borough.

He
 said: 'This council takes a zero tolerance approach to antisocial 
behaviour and our residents can now bid these neighbours from hell 
farewell.

Not bad: The quiet and leafy road where Ms Mahmoud and her family live

'It is appalling that families like this repay the British taxpayer by wreaking havoc and showing a complete lack of respect to their law-abiding and hard-working neighbours.

'We fully support the introduction of more sensible and lower housing benefit caps that can end this country’s damaging benefit’s culture that fails to incentivise hard work and instead support people who abide by the rules of a decent and civilised society.'

Ms Mahmoud, who came to Britain in 2000 with her husband before they split up, told reporters on Tuesday that she deserved to live in the property.

She said: ‘I am entitled to live in a house like this, even if I don’t pay for it and get benefits.

‘It is fair that the Government houses us.

‘I know I have a son who makes trouble but that doesn’t mean all my children are the same.

‘Neighbours are complaining because the landlord rented the house to council tenants – they don’t want a foreigner to live in  this street.

‘I know the house doesn’t look its best.

‘I don’t try to maintain and repair the house, I don’t fix the tiles or paint the walls.

‘I haven’t got enough money – I  only have my benefits. I don’t care if people think I am not grateful.’
