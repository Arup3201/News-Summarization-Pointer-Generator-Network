Chris Ramsey has been appointed Queens Park Rangers manager until the end of the season.  

Players have been thoroughly impressed by Ramsey's coaching sessions since he assumed control of first team matters last Tuesday.

QPR currently lie 17th in the Premier League, outside the relegation zone by virtue of their superior goal difference.

The caretaker boss did his chances no harm with victory over Sunderland on Tuesday night - with the 2-0 win seeing QPR record their first away triumph of the season.

Ramsey takes over from Harry Redknapp who resigned due to problems with his knees.

Rangers chairman Tony Fernandes had tweeted on Tuesday that he thought he had secured his 'dream manager' which led to a flurry of bets on Michael Laudrup.

But the ex-Swansea boss was ruled out the following day when he told associates in Denmark that he planned to see out his contract with Qatari club Lekhwiya. 

Captain Joey Barton was the first to tweet his congratulations, saying: 'Good news also on Chris Ramsey. V good since he has come in. Got group back on track. Lots for us all to do now to keep club in the league.'

QPR took on MLS side Chicago Fire in a friendly on Thursday with Quincy Amarikwa's first-strike the only goal of the game.

Adel Taarabt, Mauro Zarate and Sandro all started for the home side.

Here Sportsmail look at five key issues he needs to address to ensure they beat the drop.

AWAY FORM

Despite picking up their first win on the road against Sunderland last time out, the previous 11 matches did not yield a single point for Rangers. With Arsenal, Tottenham and Chelsea still to come to Loftus Road, their away form could be the key to ensuring their Premier League survival.

LEAKY DEFENCE

Rangers have the joint worst defensive record in the league and, with goals also at a premium, tightening up at the back is a must. Harry Redknapp failed to identify his preferred central defensive partnership so finding a system that gets the best out of Rio Ferdinand and Steven Caulker could make the difference.

SHARE THE GOALS

Charlie Austin has contributed 50 per cent of QPR's goals in the Premier League and that form has rightly led to talk of a potential England call-up. But Ramsey will be looking for someone else to help shoulder the scoring burden, especially with the former Burnley man not having scored in open play since the December win over West Brom.

CALM JOEY BARTON DOWN

This may be easier said than done, with the combative midfielder becoming the first player in Premier League history to be cautioned in seven consecutive matches. Barton's leadership qualities and never-say-die attitude are far more beneficial on the field than off it, so avoiding suspensions is crucial.

INTEGRATE A SQUAD OF EGOS

Barton, Adel Taarabt, Ferdinand. None of the three are afraid to speak their minds and they are not the only squad members with chequered pasts. Sandro and Mauro Zarate have also had high-profile disagreements with managers and Ramsey will need to forge a team ethos to stand any chance of survival.
