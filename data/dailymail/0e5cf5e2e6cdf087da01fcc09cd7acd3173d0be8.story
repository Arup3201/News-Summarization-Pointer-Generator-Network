The father of Olympic swimming champion Ryan Lochte today insisted he would never ask his $3million son for financial aid - despite losing his home to foreclosure.

Steven Lochte, 61, spoke out as it was revealed he and his ex-wife Ileana lost their Florida home in October 2013 - even though their son has raked in millions of dollars in endorsements.

And speaking from training, the swimming coach hit back at 'mean' reports that his son should have cleared his parents' debt, adding: 'It's not Ryan's problem, we would never ask him for help.'

Mr Lochte and his ex-wife, who were divorced in 2011, now live in their own, separate homes, as he said: 'Everything's sorted, I have a town house, my ex-wife has her own home. We're all good.'

When asked if Ryan had actually offered to help out, Mr Lochte said he would never have asked his famous son for aid.

Mr Lochte said Ryan, who has moved from Florida to Charlotte to train at SwimMAC Carolina for the 2016 Rio Olympics, is 'excellent'.

He added: 'He's back in the water and he starts full time training in February, he's getting ready for 2016.'

The Lochtes, who have five children, were first sued by CitiMortgage in 2012. The bank has claimed they took a loan for $258,000 in 2007 which was due to be repaid at a rate of $1,609.58 a month.

However, according to court documents first obtained by RadarOnline, the couple stopped making mortgage payments in 2011 and owed more than $242,000.

The judge signed an order in favor of the bank for around $300,000.

The bank is yet to put the suburban home up for auction. The Florida property is nestled among trees and, as might be expected, comes with a swimming pool.

Ryan Lochte's Steven was arrested for DUI in 2010

In 2012, Ileana Lochte, 60, told USA Today Sports that none of her children were aware of the foreclosure proceedings.

She said: 'I just got divorced and I had lost my job and we're trying to work it out.

'I'm sad that the press thinks this is something to do with Ryan.

'We didn't discuss this with Ryan or any of my children, really. I would never allow him to help us.'

That same month, Ryan's younger brother Devon, a one-time strong aspiring swimmer, was busted for allegedly selling marijuana to a police informant in Florida.

'He sold a confidential source two grams of cannabis for 40 bucks,' Officer Ben Tobias, spokesman for the Gainesville Police Department told MailOnline.

Mrs Lochte is now believed to be living with her daughter Kristin at her home in Daytona Beach, Florida, according to official records.

Ryan's earning potential rocketed following his success at the London Olympic Games in 2012.

He had his own reality TV show What Would Ryan Lochte Do? on E! but it was canceled after one season.

Prior to the 2012 Olympics, Fortune Magazine estimated that Lochte earned $2.3 million from endorsement deals with brands including Speedo Gatorade and Ralph Lauren.

He now has an estimated net worth of $3million, according to reports.

According to RadarOnline the Olympian was unable to help save his parents’ home.

Born in New York, Ryan started swimming at 
five years old and was coached by his swimming teacher father. He 
qualified for his first Olympic Games in 2004.

He has announced he will continue to swim professionally through to the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

The swimmer's parents stopped making mortgage payments just months after Steven Lochte  was arrested for a DUI in April 2010. A misdemeanor DUI meant that Mr Lochte was stripped of his license for one year, Gainesville police said.

Lochte has numerous lucrative endorsements earning him millions including with sports drink Gatorade
