A Seattle man caused $60,000 in damage after using a homemade blowtorch to try to kill a spider in his rental home on Tuesday night.

The 24-year-old, who lived in the house with his mother, had used a can of spray paint and a lighter to try to chase the spider from a laundry room, but the fire quickly took hold.

The man, who has not been named, tried to douse the flames with water but it soon spread to the attic.

Blaze: Flames can be seen breaking through the roof of the Seattle home on Tuesday night after a man tried to kill a spider with a blowtorch

Debris: A tarpaulin has been pulled over the house roof and charred furniture has been dragged outside as the owners survey the damage

No one was injured in the blaze, although the spider is believed to have perished.

Attempts by fire crews to put out the blaze were delayed over fears that rounds of ammunition may be stored inside.

Seattle fire department's spokesman Kyle Moore said the tenant had used 'a self-made blowtorch to kill a spider in the laundry room.'

'I don't want to encourage people to do 
this, but that's what he did,' Moore said.

'The spider tried 
to get into the wall. He sprayed flames on the wall, lit the wall on 
fire, and that extended up to the ceiling.'

Washington state is home to two venomous spiders - the black widow and the hobo spider. While deaths from both are rare, hobo spiders can cause skin ulcerations, headaches and disorientation.

A black widow bite has been known to kill in a small percentage of cases. Mostly, its venom causes severe muscle spasms.

It is not clear if the spider was a venomous one, but Moore said that fire was not the most effective way to get rid of creepy crawlies.

Neighbors described seeing flames and black smoke pouring from the property as the fire took hold.

'There were giant clouds of smoke pouring out of the windows,' Kaitlin Sharp told Kiro TV.

The Red Cross is providing temporary accommodation for the displaced family after the house was declared uninhabitable.
