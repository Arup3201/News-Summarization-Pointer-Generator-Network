Anthony Hamilton's 'Info Wing' is to undergo a few design tweaks after a successful maiden track test in Abu Dhabi.

Force India ran the LED display system on top of one of their cars on the second day of the final two-day test of the season at the Yas Marina circuit.

Using information provided from race control, the aim of the concept is to provide to the viewing public positional data, along with other information such as tyre strategy and on-track flag condition.

The Info Wing was tested by Force India in Abu Dhabi, it was placed above the driver's head

The test at least highlighted to Hamilton, whose son Lewis was crowned Formula One world champion for a second time last Sunday, where areas of modification are required.

Hamilton said: 'As I suspected the bright sunlight made it a bit difficult to see the LEDs when the cars were out on track.

'In the garage it looked like it was going to be bright enough, and at particular points on the circuit it looked bright enough.

'But we're probably going to need to change the LEDs, make them slightly larger and slightly brighter.

Problems appeared when it proved difficult to see the LED lights in the bright sunshine 

'Overall (Force India) thought it looked quite good and think it's going to work well if we can just brighten it up slightly.

'You can do as much testing here in the UK you think is viable, but obviously we don't have the bright sunshine like in Abu Dhabi.

'Nevertheless it was a good test, and it bodes well for the new version.'

The next version of the system will incorporate a new-shaped camera mount and a double-LED display showing not only race position data, but also the first three letters of a driver's surname.

The technology will be able to display a variety of information once it is fully operational

'Based on the feedback we're going to be designing the new unit right now, and I hope to have the new circuit board ready in the next three weeks,' added Hamilton

'I'm going to persevere with it because based on the story that emerged last week there has been a huge amount of interest.

'People love the idea, although of course there are the die-hard fans who say 'we understand racing, we don't need that'.

'But it's not just for the die-hard fans, it's for fans generally.'

Hamilton is currently awaiting feedback from the sport's world governing body the FIA.
