A talented labrador called Jack has triumphed in a national pets competition after impressing judges with his ability to fetch objects by swimming to them.

The ten-year-old canine’s achievement is even more remarkable because he lost his sight three years ago.

His owner Margaret Simpson had always 
thought her four-legged Michael Phelps had the potential to become a 
winner with his special aquatic talents.

Now he’s been named Pet Champion in the water sports category of the UK Spot On awards.

Mrs Simpson, who lives in Potters Green, Coventry said: 'I was really surprised when he won and it is great for him to finally be recognised for his achievements.

'When we got him, he was losing his sight and we taught him how to stop, look left and right, and when we were out walking, wherever there was water, he could sense it.

'Then he started going into ponds and canals using only his smell, putting his head underwater and bringing back big rocks.

Jack was awarded £200 by judges and Mrs Simpson said she will spend his winnings on his vet bills and treat him to a new collar and dummy

'Then we started throwing in a dummy, which was better for his teeth, and he just dived in.

'That’s when we realised how talented he was.'

Hundreds of pets were entered into the four categories - ball skills, agility, water sports and mind games.

Jack was picked out by the judges in his category for his ability to spot objects in the water without his sight.

Jack developed progressive retinal atrophy, a common genetic disease, when he was aged six and slowly lost his sight over a year

He can often be seen with proud owner Mrs Simpson and her husband Keith swimming through Ryton Pools, Rutland Water and at pools near the Miner’s Welfare Park in Bedworth, Coventry.

'The voting for the competition went on for six months so I almost forgot about it for a while,' added Mrs Simpson, who also owns a rescue lurcher called Cherry.

'We have had to think about his blindness and train him but he has always just got on with it just like any normal lad.

'Jack really is the happiest dog we’ve ever had and a sociable dog, and despite all that has happened to him, he doesn’t let any of it hold him back.'

Mrs Simpson regularly enters her two dogs into competitions and dog shows to raise awareness and money for dog charities but this is the first time any of them have won a big prize.

Jack was awarded £200 by judges and Mrs Simpson said she will spend his winnings on his vet bills and treat him to a new collar and dummy.
