Rio Ferdinand might struggle to convince the majority of coaches in modern elite sport that banning chips the night before a game amounted to a catastrophic error of judgment.

But in his new autobiography the former Manchester United defender presents an aversion to deep fried potatoes as one of a number of reasons why David Moyes failed to last beyond 10 months as the successor to Sir Alex Ferguson.

Some might point to Ferdinand as one of a number of senior players who happened to be past their best when Moyes took charge at Old Trafford in July last year. There is no denying Moyes was presented with a huge rebuilding job that is only now being addressed by Louis van Gaal with a massive transfer outlay approaching £200million.

Moyes would not deny he made mistakes either. Indeed he admitted as much in the interview he gave to Sportsmail; the first since his brutal dismissal on April 22.

But Ferdinand gives his own, fairly detailed view of the Moyes tenure in the book, #2Sides, being serialised in The Sun.

The 35-year-old defender, who moved to QPR during the summer, does recognise that Moyes was ‘unlucky’. He also says he could not fault his desire to succeed. ‘He was a genuine guy and no one could have worked harder,’ he writes.

But Ferdinand thought Moyes made a number of key mistakes, among them the banning of what had long been part of a traditional pre-match meal. He said it was ‘a ritual’ to have ‘low-fat chips the night before a game’.

Ferdinand said the United players ‘loved’ their chips but within a week of becoming manager Moyes had banned them ‘for no good reason’. ‘All the lads were p****d off,’ complains Ferdinand. He says the moment Moyes left and Ryan Giggs took temporary charge, chips returned to the menu.

Moyes believed in going for a pre-match team walk. Ferdinand said this was anathema to the players. ‘When lots of little things start changing its destabilising,’ he said.

In his interview with Sportsmail, Moyes accepted that in hindsight he might have taken ‘a slightly different approach’. At the same time he conceded methods that proved successful at Everton perhaps did not work as well at United. But he insisted he did not go in and make wholesale changes. ‘I didn’t want to change anything immediately,’ he said last month. ‘I wanted to take my time working out what I thought was needed.’ He felt he was ‘not given time to succeed or fail’, but praised the players for their work ethic. ‘They were fantastic,’ he said.

Ferdinand is not quite so generous towards Moyes, claiming there was a lack of clarity when it came to tactics and a lack of appreciation of what it meant to be part of United.

He recalls a training session Moyes held in a public part of Munich ahead of a Champions League game at Bayern.

Ferdinand said it was ‘bizarre’ to practise set-pieces in front of members of the public who began filming the session. ‘It was amateurish,’ writes Ferdinand. ‘I mean, why not just send Bayern an email or a DVD.’

Ferdinand reveals how Moyes then told him he would not be playing against the Germans ‘in front of everybody’.

‘It was probably the worst single moment I had at United,’ he recalls. ‘It killed me. Inside I wanted to scream and grab him.’

When it came to delivering instructions for the match, Ferdinand claims Moyes only succeeded in confusing the players. He says Ferguson used to give ‘simple, concise, clear instructions’. Moyes, however, said they could employ ‘three formations’ depending on ‘how Bayern played’. ‘We lost and 13 days later Moyes was sacked,’ writes Ferdinand.

The former England captain agrees that Moyes was not dismissed ‘in a dignified way’ by United. But he says Moyes ‘tried to impose a vision but never seemed to be completely clear what that vision should be’.

He says he ‘unintentionally created a negative vibe’ and ‘slowly lost’ the players because of an ‘accumulation of mistakes’.

Ferdinand thinks Moyes abandoned United’s tradition for playing with ‘wingers’, and instead ‘wanted the wide players coming inside’. He also stopped the ‘small-sided match on a small pitch’ the players used to enjoy under Ferguson on the eve of a game, changing it to a two-touch game. Ferdinand says this was why United so often ‘looked cramped and played without imagination’.
