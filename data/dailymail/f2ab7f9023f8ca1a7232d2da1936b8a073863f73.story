The appliance of science behind Ronny Deila’s Celtic reign was there for all to see on Sunday afternoon. Any lingering scepticism about his methods surely went the same way as Aberdeen’s resistance.

Despite playing with 10 men for much of a demanding, frustrating 90 minutes against Inter Milan three days previously – and the associated, sleep-disturbing travelling – Deila’s team simply ran all over their perceived title rivals in the second half of a 4-0 victory. It was an impressive display of physical power and mental focus.

The Norwegian’s insistence that Celtic could be fitter caused a fair degree of controversy early in his tenure. It was interpreted – or perhaps misinterpreted – as a slight on predecessor Neil Lennon.

Ronny Deila's Celtic side are starting to become formidable under the Norwegian's reign at Parkhead 

But this much is clear. Deila has unquestionably made the Parkhead side more formidable in that regard. And he has all the stats to back it up. Including one which earned recent arrival Gary Mackay-Steven a rapid (in more ways than one) gold star.

Crunching the numbers after matches is an important aspect of Deila’s work when it comes to assessing various aspects of his players’ performances. To the 39-year-old, these reams of figures produced by the technology at Celtic’s disposal provide an objective view to place alongside his managerial opinion. The hope is that it leads to better decisions.

Again, there would have been a few from the football old-school previously willing to raise an eyebrow at such talk. But what happened at the weekend provided a riposte to any sneers.

Deila (centre) is keen on his players being the fittest and results have shown impressive statistics 

‘I think the most important thing is that the players see and also the people around them - you and everybody - see that what we are doing is effective,’ said Deila.

‘There are always things that we can do better and we have had some bad results, but I think we have had six victories after coming home from European games. That’s really good. You don’t see that around the other European leagues. Inter Milan lost at the weekend and they are struggling a lot when they come back — so we did well to win in that way.

‘The amount of metres and sprints on Sunday was unbelievable when you consider we played three days before. We have increased the high-intensity running by 30-40 percent since the summer. That is a lot.

Gary Mackay-Steven (right) ran an impressive 1300 metres against Aberdeen on Sunday

‘We want to be direct, we want to create things, we want to have penetration, we want to be a high-pressing team, so you have to run quick and you see that in the stats and in how we perform.’

Asked if he knew which of his players topped the various statistic tables, Deila broke into a grin.

‘I know everything about the players,’ he laughed. ‘When we played Inter at home, their striker, Rodrigo Palacio, ran 1250 metres at high intensity against us, sprinting. That is an incredible number. But at the weekend Gary Mackay-Steven ran 1300m!

‘You have to know the references of what it means to be fit. It’s easy to say that to the other players, if I tell them how far Gary Mackay-Steven ran in a game and compare it to them.

Deila highlighted how impressive Palacio's running was against his side in the Europa League clash

‘If a player asks me why he is sitting on the bench and not playing, I can show him the numbers. If he is running 600m and the guy in the team is running 1200m, what does he think of that?

‘Why can’t Gary run as far every game? Stuart Armstrong ran 900m on Sunday and he didn’t play the whole game.’

It was pointed out that Armstrong actually lasted only 62 minutes after replacing Kris Commons against Aberdeen, before being hurt and making way for Anthony Stokes. Was that not evidence of the midfielder being overworked?

The winger also scored a terrific solo goal against their title rivals to send the Bhoys six points clear

‘It was cramp, he’ll be okay for (tonight’s game) against St Johnstone,’ said the Celtic manager. ‘It was a sign that he is not strong enough yet. You have to think of the mental and physical loading on a player.

‘Just coming to Celtic - dealing with the contract, the media and so on - used a lot of mental energy in Gary and Stuart.

‘Then the training is at a much higher tempo then they have been used to before. The total loading gets too much. That’s why Stuart started on the bench.

‘But then Scott Brown is doing it every day. He is so strong, unbelievably strong. Why? Because he has done this for many years, he works really hard every single day and he looks after himself. Stefan Johansen is also starting to get that into his body.’

So is it a case of simply saying the best teams are the fittest teams?

Scott Brown has been praised by his manager for his unbelievable strength and work ethic

‘No, that’s not true,’ countered Deila. ‘But that’s the easiest thing to do something with. I don’t think the best teams are the fittest – they could be – but there are so many parameters, so many boxes you have to fill in football.

‘We don’t train more than they did before but hopefully we train better and we give more in that hour-and-a-half every day.

‘As for the stats, we use them in different situations. It is not only stats about running but who has been involved in goal chances offensively and defensively. Instead of saying something subjectively, you can see it as a fact.

Stuart Armstrong is also a willing runner for Celtic and his stats are impressive since he joined the club

‘But everything has to be related to football. We are not marathon runners. It is about what we do on the pitch.’

What Celtic have done on Scottish pitches is win their last 10 domestic matches. Making it 11 against St Johnstone at Parkhead will push them nine points clear of Aberdeen. Complacency might be the creeping danger, but Deila doesn’t detect any traces of that corrosive commodity.

‘There is still so much to fight for,’ he insisted. ‘We are working here on the culture, every day, to be 100 per cent every day.

‘I have no reason to be worried because I haven’t once seen the players have a bad attitude or a lack of concentration. I am really looking forward to the game and I expect a good performance and hopefully a good result.’
