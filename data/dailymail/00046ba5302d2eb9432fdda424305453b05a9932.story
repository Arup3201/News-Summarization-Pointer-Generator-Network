She may currently be filming for a Made In Chelsea spin-off over in New York but Lucy Watson's latest fashion shoot is quintessentially British.

The 23-year-old has just been unveiled as the new face of Lipsy's AW14 VIP collection, a capsule range of occasionwear.

Lucy, who can be seen posing in an array of glamorous gowns in the English countryside, told MailOnline that she was honoured to be asked to work with Lipsy because she's been wearing their designs since she was 16.

'I was so happy to do this and the dresses are feminine, perfect for different occasions and perfectly reflect my style,' she told us.

Sharing her top tips for prom dressing, which she says the range is perfect for, Lucy said: 'It's so important to go for a colour that suits you because it's a moment you'll remember for the rest of your life.

'I love dresses that are figure-hugging. Sadly, I went for a giant bright pink dress and I had really blonde hair, which was extremely girly. I looked like Barbie.'

In terms of her day-to-day style, Lucy says that she has no time to shop and buys everything online. 'I prefer to buy high street clothes because I usually only wear an item once,' she said.

She has a stylist who 'buys her stuff that she likes' but she dresses herself and aspires to look like 'cool' Kylie Jenner or Miranda Kerr, who she thinks is 'sophisticated with a feminine edge to her'.

Before she flew out to New York, Lucy was working out with a trainer twice a week to get in shape for her stint in the Big Apple.

'I really wanted to be in good shape for our trip but filming has been so hectic, it's really hard. I definitely eat what I want and I'm obsessed with my smoothie maker,' she said of her diet.

In between filming and unveiling her new jewellery range, Lucy has penned her debut tome, The Dating Game, which she describes as the modern girlâ€™s no-holds-barred guide to 21st century dating, relationships and break-ups.

'I'm so proud of my book and I'm pretty overwhelmed with how it's done. I'm brutally honest, as always, and I think that's why people like me; they appreciate it.'

Speaking about plans for the future, Lucy added: 'I
want to stay in the industry and being on MIC has taught me loads about
working behind-the-scenes producing and directing, which I love, so 
maybe one day I will look into that.

'I also love presenting and would love to have my own show,' she said.
