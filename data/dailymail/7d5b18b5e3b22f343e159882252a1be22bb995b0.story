The documentary film-maker is believed to have succumbed to hypothermia while making a film about the homeless

A young filmmaker is believed to have frozen to death while making a documentary about sleeping rough on the streets as he tried to impress television bosses.

Lee Halpin planned to spend this week on the streets of Newcastle experiencing and filming what life is like for those who are living rough.

In a video explaining his project, he claimed he was applying for a position on a Channel 4 investigative journalism programme.

He said that as he had to show the channel he could be 'fearless' - a key 'value' of the broadcaster - he planned to spend a week 'immersed' in the world of homelessness, and wanted to 'sleep rough and scrounge for food.'

But three days after embarking on the project talented Lee, who lived with his family in Heaton, Newcastle, was found dead in a boarded-up hostel on Westgate Road, Newcastle.

It is not yet known how he died, but it's feared the 27-year-old may have succumbed to hypothermia.

The hopeful journalist said that he had spoken to homeless charity Crisis, and wanted to see what was available for homeless people in the North East.

Haplin said: 'I am about to go and spend a week being homeless, I will sleep rough for a week, scrounge for my food.

'I will access the services that other people in the west end (of Newcastle) use.

'I will interact with as many homeless people as possible and immerse myself in that lifestyle as deeply as I can.

He was discovered in a boarded-up hostel on Westgate Road, Newcastle. Mourning friends have paid tribute to the talented director

'This seems to be a fearless approach to a story.

'It has caused a huge amount of trepidation among my friends and family.'

He also said that he wanted to investigate whether the coalition government's much-criticised bedroom tax would impact on people in Newcastle, and whether it would lead to homelessness.

A Met Office spokesman confirmed the lowest recorded temperature for Newcastle early on April 3 was around -4.2C.

Friends
 have since paid tribute to the 'thoroughly excellent bloke' and have 
spoken of his death as the 'ultimate sacrifice' in raising awareness of 
homelessness.

Lee had spoken with his friends about
 looking forward to the project and on Sunday was asking his 1,500 
Twitter followers if anyone had a sleeping bag he could borrow.

In
 his last Tweet - on Sunday at 11.05am - Lee asked his followers: 'If 
anyone has got an old phone I can have for a week, I'd be very 
grateful.'

Lee's 
friend of 10 years Daniel Lake said: 'I was just talking to Lee on 
Saturday, having some banter talking about football and how excited he 
was about going out filming.

Just three days after embarking on the project Lee was found dead in a boarded-up hostel on Westgate Road, Newcastle

'Lee was a great guy, a character and was well known. His big things were creative writing and poetry.

'He was making a documentary about homeless people living in Newcastle's West End.

'No one knows how he passed away, but we think it could have been hypothermia.

'He made the ultimate sacrifice trying to raise awareness about what was happening to other people.'

Lee, was discovered in the vacant Summerhill Hostel just before 10am on Wednesday.

A
 Northumbria Police spokesman said it was believed no third party was 
involved in his death, adding: 'Police were informed the body of a man 
believed to be in his 20s had been found in a derelict building in 
Westgate Road.

'A report will be prepared for the coroner.'

Paramedics were also called to the property.

Since Lee's death, tributes have come in from friends and those who knew him.

One friend described Lee as 'a great advocate for the north-east arts scene'.

The Channel 4 website explains how they want applicants to show how they are 'fearless'

Having completed his creative writing MA at Newcastle University, Lee went on to become a founder editor of Novel, a magazine covering all aspects of North East culture from performances and exhibitions to launch parties and talent.

And for almost a year, he'd featured on the airwaves with his The Weekend Starts Here Show on Radio Tyneside, on Fridays from 8pm till 10pm.

On Twitter, tributes have been paid by those who worked with and knew Lee.

Staff at Intimation Creative said: 'We're very sad to hear that Lee Halpin passed away.

'Our thoughts go out to Lee's family and many friends.'

Dan Howarth described Lee as a 'talented, courageous and thoroughly excellent bloke', adding: 'Shattered by the news of the death of Lee Halpin. A massive loss.'

The channel's Investigative Journalism Programme works with their current affairs programme Dispatches to give aspiring journalists the opportunity to work within a production company and develop ideas for Dispatches.Â 

The successful applicants are given a contract for up to 12 months and will 'learn the fundamentals of investigative journalism and how new technologies and social media can help you to bag your biggest scoops'.

Entrants submit a video, answer a questionnaire and explain, in a video, why they are 'fearless' - an attribute that the broadcaster says is one of its key values.

Leslie Morphy, chief executive of Crisis, said: 'I was extremely saddened to hear the news of the death of Lee Halpin. My thoughts are with his friends and family at this difficult time.

'His tragic death highlights just how dangerous sleeping rough can be, especially during the freezing weather we are currently experiencing, which is why we would never encourage that anyone voluntarily put their life at risk in this way.

'Research for Crisis showed that the average age of death for homeless people is just 47.

'Unfortunately homelessness is on the rise with a 31 per cent rise in rough sleeping across England over the last two years. The combination of the economic downturn and cuts to benefits mean that we sadly expect this to continue to rise further.'

A Channel 4 spokesman said: 'We are saddened to learn of the tragic death of this aspiring young journalist. Our thoughts are with his family.'

Police have made two arrests in connection with the death of Lee Halpin.

A spokesperson for Northumbria Police said: 'Officers have arrested two men aged 26 and 30 on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of a controlled drug.

'They have been bailed pending further enquiries and a report into the death of the man is is being prepared for the coroner.'
