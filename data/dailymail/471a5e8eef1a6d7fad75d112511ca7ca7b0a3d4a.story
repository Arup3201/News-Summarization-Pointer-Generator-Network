Craig Gordon revelled in the first match of the rest of his career with a 45-minute clean sheet before wholesale half-time changes and a second period slump saw Celtic settle for a score draw with Dynamo Dresden in scorching conditions.

There were two sides to the Scottish champions as Gordon, entertaining ambitions of  challenging Fraser Forster for the No 1 job and earning a Scotland comeback, made his Celtic debut.

Ronny Deila started different teams in each half but Gordon was certainly not treating the match like a bounce event as the Glucksgas Stadion played host to a new  beginning for the popular keeper.

Return: Craig Gordon was back in action for Celtic after a long layoff from football

CELTIC (4-2-3-1): Gordon (Zaluska 46'); Matthews (Lustig 46'), Ambrose (O’Connell 46'), van Dijk (Findlay 46'), F.Twardzik (Izaguirre 46'); Kayal (Johansen 46'), Biton (Mulgrew 46'); McGeouch (Griffiths 46'), Commons (Henderson 41')  McGregor (Boerrigter 46'); Pukki (Fridjonsson 46')

Sporting all purple and the No 26 jersey, the 31-year-old hadn’t played a competitive game since April 2012 because of a succession of knee injury complications.

This felt just like being back in the big time for the £9million man, even in the pre-season environment of a stadium less than half full.

It was all of six minutes before he was required to use his invaluable full stretch, throwing himself right to claw away Marvin Stefaniak’s diagonal drive.

‘It felt like a big moment for me,’ said Gordon. ‘It was an awkward shot to the far corner. When he hit it, I thought it was going to be more comfortable than it was.

‘It was full stretch in the end but I was happy at that, got a decent hand on it to keep it out and get it wide. It settled me down a little bit.

‘I was a little bit nervous but I get that before every game. Friendlies can feel like not a proper game but it did in this place, a nice stadium, and it was noisy behind me.

‘That was probably good for me to help me concentrate on the game, an added help rather than a hindrance. It felt like a normal match.

‘I’ve worked really hard over the past couple of years to get to this point and, although it was only 45 minutes, it’s definitely a step in the right direction.’

On target: Kris Commons opened the scoring for Celtic in the first half

Gordon has been patient to build towards making his career comeback this season, including a lengthy training spell with Rangers last term.

His tolerance for waiting will have its limits, though, as he sets himself targets to play as much as possible to make up for lost time.

‘I just want to play games,’ said the former Hearts and Sunderland  goalkeeper.

‘I’ve done a reasonable amount of training over the past few months, since January. It’s the game  situations I am looking forward to getting into now.

‘That’s what I want. Doing that has been a large part of my life and not to have that over the past couple of years has been difficult. It was nice to get a piece of that back — then get a clean sheet.’

Lukasz Zaluska replaced Gordon at the break but there was one switch forced upon the manager that gave more cause for concern.

As Gordon put his injury woes well behind him, scorer Kris Commons hobbled off just before the interval, nursing a thigh problem after a thudding challenge by over-physical Dresden defender Michael Hefele.

Deila reported no ill effects thanks to the precautionary withdrawal and Commons should be passed fit for the Champions League second qualifying round return leg against KR Reykjavik at Murrayfield  on Tuesday.

The teams wore black armbands and observed a moment’s silence before kick-off as a mark of respect for 10 people killed in a horrific motorway bus accident in the early hours of yesterday morning.

The home crowd then cranked up the atmosphere, even though this was only a friendly, the bulk of  the din coming from behind  Gordon’s goal in the first half.

That said, the comeback star ensured his defenders could  understand his ire clearly. He  certainly made himself heard as errant marking gifted Luca Durholtz a chance, which he fluffed at the back post.

Celtic were smartly into the lead below a searing sun on eight  minutes.

Teemu Pukki, playing through the middle, shielded the ball well with his back to goal and Commons read the signals to latch on to the lay-off with a sweetly struck, low left foot drive past an unsighted Benjamin Kirsten.

This was the sixth match of  Celtic’s new season and Deila had  no wish to sap any energy from influential players ahead of what he hopes are five more Champions League qualifiers.

Taking a cue from the World Cup, there were water breaks midway through each half — not something that will trouble Celtic in the  domestic season. Dynamo, relegated to the third tier of the German game, start their league next week.

So with Tuesday’s tie in mind — then either Legia Warsaw or  St Patrick’s the following week —  there was no surprise when Deila started an entirely different XI in the second half.

That included Stuart Findlay and Eoghan O’Connell as a centre-half pairing, and Icelandic Under-21 international Holmbert Fridjonsson — too often frustrated by taking a heavy touch — up front.

Much misfiring from the hosts had meant Gordon wasn’t relentlessly  occupied. Instead it was Zaluska who ended up picking the ball out of  his net.

Emilio Izaguirre cleared Stefaniak’s clipped finish off the line but it fell to the feet of Sylvano Comvalius, who took time to select his spot and fire home from six yards.
