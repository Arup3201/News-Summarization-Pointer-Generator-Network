It played a starring role in the Tour de France's Grand Départ but, despite its recent boost in profile, the steel city of Sheffield is a real steal when it comes to a value-for-money short break.

The Yorkshire town offered the best bargain one-night break among 20 UK cities surveyed by TripAdvisor, with Edinburgh proving to be the place that would set visitors back the most.

The travel website compared the cost of two people booking a one-night stay in a four-star hotel in August, with the overall cost of the trip including a pre-meal cocktail, a meal out and a short taxi ride.
