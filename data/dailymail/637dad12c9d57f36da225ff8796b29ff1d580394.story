Vera McClure is spending her 90th year in the same Rotherham house and says she could not bear to be anywhere else in the world.

Her grandparents moved in as the first tenants when the property was built in 1912 and then Vera’s parents followed before she took over.

Mrs McClure, who still lives independently, was born in the local hospital and was taken home when she just was a few days old, living there ever since.

No place like home: Vera McClure outside the Rotherham house she has lived in for 90 years and counting

Over the years Vera’s family have tried to persuade her to move to a more modern property but she is happy staying in Masbrough, Rotherham, although she has had a stair lift installed to make life a little easier.

When her grandparents Herbert and Eliza Lounds got it, it was one of the best houses in the street because it had a separate kitchen, although bath nights were spent in a zinc bath in the cellar.

They were followed by Vera's parents, Edith and Sidney Swaine, who she lived there with to look after the couple when they got older.

Vera, the youngest of three children, stayed at the house after she married taxi driver Bill McClare in 1948 to care for her parents after her father was seriously injured in a works accident.

And when Bill died in 1991 Vera was determined to stay in the house, the only home she had known, and she bought the property.

'It is what you would call a real family home,' she said.

Happy birthday: Vera cuts her cake surrounded by her three children Lynsey, Teresa and Pat, who were born in the front room which also doubled as Vera's hairdressers shop

Vera, who celebrated her 90th birthday with family and friends recently, said: 'My parents moved in to look after my grandparents and I stayed here to care for my mum and dad when the got older.

'I met Bill before the war, he joined the army and was a prisoner of war for six years, after being captured in Crete. I worked in a munitions factory and when we got married I told Bill I wanted to stay in the house to care for mum and dad and he agreed.

I was a hairdresser when I left school and after the war I opened up a shop in my front room, it was just known as Vera’s.But I stopped hairdressing in the Sixties because I wanted it to be a proper house again.

'I am so comfortable here. I have a kitchen, a living room and a front room and. We had three bedrooms but converted one into a bathroom. I also have a garden, it’s a lovely house and why should I ever want to leave it.'

Vera, who has eight grandchildren and five great grandchildren added: 'I have also had some lovely neighbours over the years and I now have a stairlift which has made life a lot more comfortable for me.'

Although she does all her own cooking and housework daughters Lindsey McLaughlin, Teresa Beecher, 62 and 57 year old Pat Webster, who were all born in the front room of the house, keep an eye on her.

Lindsey, 63: 'I think it’s lovely that mum is so happy in that house, it holds so many memories. Her parents moved in to look after their parents and mum stayed to look after her family.

'She didn’t want to leave them after she was married and my dad agreed to live there rather than them set up a home together.Mum has worked all her life and had a job in a factory and later as a cashier when she stopped hairdressing.

'She is very independent and keeps her home lovely, After dad died she was still determined to stay there alone and even bought the house to make sure she would never have to leave.'
