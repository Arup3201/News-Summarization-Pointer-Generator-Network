Four 11-year-olds jumped out of a car belonging to one of their mothers after it became clear she was driving while drunk on Tuesday night.

The terrified kids, two boys and two girls, had been on a day out in Gainesville, Florida, under the supervision of the mother of one of the boys, Angela Renee Woodworth of Interlachen, when she became so drunk that her driving was impaired.

After the car hit the pole and a mirror was broken off  at about 8:30 p.m., the four children fled to a nearby Steak ‘n Shake restaurant where they alerted diners, who called the police.

Angela Woodworth, 45, was arrested on Tuesday in Gainesville after her son and three friends realised she was drunk, jumped out of her car and fled into a restaurant after she began swerving across the road

‘One of the boys told me his mom, they just left Ruby Tuesday, and his mom was really drunk and swerving all over the road," Josh Kramer, who was dining at the restaurant, told WJXT.

'When they came to a stop, the kids jumped out of the car and ran into the restaurant.’

Kramer called 911.

While he was on the phone to the 911 dispatcher, Woodworth entered the restaurant and began to scream at the children, ordering them toget back in the car.

‘The kids took off running around the restaurant. She started following them around the restaurant.'

'I finally got them back up front and told them to stay on the sidewalk, police would be here in a second and they didn't need to be scared. I was helping them out,’ said Kramer.

When a police officer arrived the children ran to him.

Woodworth’s son told police that they had visited a park, a Chinese restaurant, had been bowling, and had gone to the mall.

He also told police that his mother had drunk two pitchers of beer at the bowling alley and had a margarita at a branch of Ruby Tuesday at the mall.

The other children gave the same account of events. 

Police discovered from charge receipts that Woodworth had consumed four drinks at Ruby Tuesday while the children roamed the mall unsupervised.

It was when they left the mall that Woodworth began to swerve all over the road.

Gainesville Police Department officer Ben Tobias described the scene: ‘They were not in a parking space, so we could only assume that her driving was so bad at that point that she couldn't even make it into the parking space.’

‘We are very glad that the children were not hurt.’

Woodworth refused to cooperate with officers, and showed signs of severe impairment, including slurred speech.

Upon searching the vehicle police found 2 grams of marijuana and a pipe under the driver’s seat. 

She was subsequently arrested and charged with possession of drug paraphernalia, possession of less than 20 grams of marijuana, and four counts of child neglect, according to the Gainesville Police Department.

Officers notified the Department of Children and Families. 

Woodworth’s son was taken to stay with relatives and his three friends were returned to their parents.
