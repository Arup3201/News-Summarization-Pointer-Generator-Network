The stunning photographs capture a natural wonder that is hidden deep in the Arizona desert. The breathtaking rock formation, known as The Wave, is made from sand that has been hardened over 190million years.

Its remarkable undulating appearance, streaked with layers of autumnal hues, captures the way that the geological landscape has changed. 

It is made formed of Navajo Sandstone dunes that have calcified vertically and horizontally - turning into hardened compacted rock over time - with wind and rain erosion creating its sheer rock faces.

The breathtaking scene lies some 5,225ft above sea level, somewhere in the Vermillion Cliffs Wilderness Area. Largely unknown until it was advertised to tourists in the 1990s, visitors must now obtain a special permit to find its exact location. And even then they need to navigate a three-mile hike through the wilderness to find the beauty spot.

Photographer Justin Reznick, 36, captured  the unique landscape on a trip this spring. Mr Reznick, from Seattle, Washington, said 'there is nothing quite like it on Earth', adding, 'it has remnants of amazing sandstone but they way it comes together is truly unique.' 

Breathtaking: The striking geological formation, known as The Wave, lies deep in the Vermillion Cliffs Wilderness Area, in the Arizona desert

Snapshot: Its remarkable layered appearance, pictured above, was created by the calcification of Sandstone dunes over 190million years

Rippling: Over millions of years, the layers of calcified sandstone hardened to become the compact rock that lies in the desert today, above

Hidden: Largely unknown until it was advertised to tourists in the 1990s, visitors must now obtain a special permit to find its exact location

Stunning: Even with the permit, those hoping to see The Wave must navigate a three-hour hike through the desert to find the beauty spot

Natural wonder: The steep, rippling rock faces of the waves, seen above, were created by slow wind and rain erosion over millions of years
