Appeal: Lawyers acting for Oscar Pistorius, right, accused of shooting dead Reeva Steenkamp, left, want his bail conditions relaxed and passports returned so he can travel overseas

Lawyers acting for 'blade runner' Oscar Pistorius - accused of shooting dead his girlfriend - want his bail conditions relaxed and passports returned so he can travel overseas, it emerged today.

Pistorius, charged with the Valentine's Day murder of Reeva Steenkamp, 29, was released on strict bail conditions two weeks ago.

He was ordered to pay a bond of 1 million rand ($110,000), hand over his passports and forbidden from returning to his house, the scene of the crime.

But South African television channel eNCA said today that Pistorius and his lawyers felt his bail conditions were unfair.

'In papers before the high court they argue that Magistrate Desmond Nair was wrong to order Pistorius to hand over his passport and travel documents given that the magistrate found the athlete was not a proven flight risk,' the report said.

Pistorius' defence said he should be allowed to travel if he won consent from the detective working on the case.

They also argued that mandatory alcohol and drug tests were unnecessary and there was no need for him to report to a police station twice a week or be visited by a probation officer.

The case of the 26-year-old Olympic and Paralympic track star, a double amputee since infancy, stunned a nation that holds him up as hero who triumphed over adversity to compete with able-bodied athletes at the highest levels of sport.

On Thursday Warrant Officer Hilton 
Botha, the detective who was pulled off the investigation after it 
emerged he himself faced attempted murder charges, resigned from the 
force.

Pistorius is on bail awaiting trial for the murder of the former model after she was shot four times at his property on Valentine's Day.

It is believed Pistorius' defence will be that he mistook her for an intruder.

It is thought that the trial could be up to a year in waiting after the double-amputee was granted bail after a two-hour court hearing last month.

Desmond Nair, who reached the decision, deemed Pistorius not to be a flight risk, and was unlikely to commit further acts of violence when released from custody.

Conditions of his release include that he surrenders his passports and travel documents, does not visit his house where the model died and does not use any prohibited substances. He is also banned from drinking alcohol.

Pistorius, is charged with one count of premeditated murder over the February 14 killing of the FHM cover girl. He says the shooting was accidental because he thought she was a dangerous intruder inside his home.

Mr Nair said Pistorius' affidavit, in which he gave his version of the events of the shooting in a sworn statement, had helped his application for bail in Pretoria Magistrate's Court.

Rumours regarding the personal lives of the famous couple have been well documented.

Needles and substances found at the property that were allegedly pointing towards testosterone injections have since being discounted as being used for a herbal remedy to aid muscle recovery.

It has also been reported that Reeva was pregnant at the time of the shooting, a claim which has been fiercely denied by the deceased's family who have said that the post mortem proved this was not the case.

It is unclear when Pistorius' bail appeal will be heard.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
