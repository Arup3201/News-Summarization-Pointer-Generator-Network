Ukraine president Petro Poroshenko dissolved parliament and called for elections to be held on October 26

The Ukrainian president last night dissolved parliament in the wake of a fresh Russian incursion into the country.

Petro Poroshenko called for elections to be held on October 26, noting that the ruling coalition collapsed several weeks ago.

He added that the move was in line with the Ukrainian constitution.

According to a Russian official, a column of Russian tanks crossed into the south-east of Ukraine around dawn yesterday, bringing the conflict to an area which has so far escaped the worst of the fighting.

The news came as it emerged that thousands of Ukrainian refugees fleeing the bloodshed are being sent to Siberia.

Around 730,000 have left Ukraine since the start of the conflict, according to the United Nations.

The Siberian Times reported 600 displaced people had been put on trains to the Siberian city Irkutsk, with another 930 expected to follow.

Other groups were taken to western Siberia and the Urals.

Poroshenko is today expected to meet with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin at a summit in Minsk, Belarus.
