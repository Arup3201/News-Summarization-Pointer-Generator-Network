Fans of the Comme des Garçons PLAY label are drawing similarities between its 15-year-old logo and an apple illustration on Whole Foods market’s fall shopping bag.

The PLAY logo, a red heart with almond-shaped eyes, looks ‘separated at birth’ from Whole Foods’s red apple with round eyes, say Instagram users, who have taken to social media to air their opinion about the two designs’ congruencies.

Neither brand has issued comment on the likeness, but that hasn’t stopped one crafty Instagrammer, artist Richard Haines, from turning the discussion into an art project. He painted the Whole Foods bag for it to better resemble Comme’s insignia.

Comme des Garçons designer Rei Kawakubo, known for her avant garde, forward-thinking designs, launched PLAY as a sportswear-influenced, casual diffusion line in 2002. Its array of classic clothes has lined the shelves of lauded stores including Colette, 10 Corso Como, and CDG’s own Dover Street Market.

The label’s quirky heart with a sinister stare has become its calling card, and holds so much commercial value that in 2009 Converse launched a collaboration with the brand. They applied PLAY’s little heart to its basic Chuck Taylor styles, changing little else, and charged $100 for per pair (twice the cost of the same Converse sneakers without a logo).

The collection was such a success that the collaboration is still ongoing, four years later.

Some would even say that the Comme 
des Garçons heart has become an international calling card for a certain
echelon of relaxed, artistically-inclined cool.

So it’s not unbelievable that the label’s legion of diehard fans would become a bit agitated by an apple resembling their favorite insignia.

The two illustrations do appear similar in the way that they are both red, have cartoonish black-and-white eyes, and no mouth.

It
is not clear if Whole Foods took direct inspiration from Comme des 
Garçons PLAY when developing the apple shopping bag. The recycled paper 
bag launched in-stores in July, a store employee told MailOnline.

Representatives for both Comme des 
Garçons and Whole Foods did not wish to offer comment on the matter. But
plenty of people on Instagram have.

Response: Cherry Bombe magazine's Instagram dispatch about the Whole Foods bag received countless replies from the title's followers

CFDA CEO Steven Kolb used the Pic Stitch app to illustrate the similarities between the two illustrations, writing ‘separated at birth’ in the photo’s caption.

Rising magazine Cherry Bombe, an independent title that fuses the worlds of food and fashion, dispatched a photo of the bag, writing: ‘Did Wholefoods get Comme des Garçons to design their new grocery bags?’

Many followers commented on the image, expressing that they had been making a comparison as well.

Art project: Artist Richard Haines painted over the Whole Foods bag to make the market's apple look like the Comme heart insignia

Artist Richard Haines took the matter even further. He painted over the Whole Foods’s apple to make it look like the Comme heart.

‘The new Whole Foods apple shopping bags remind me of CdG Play,’ he wrote on an Instagram of his first take at transforming the bag, where he changed the outline of the apple’s body to look like a heart.

The art project continued with an additional dispatch. ‘Collaboration Complete,’ he wrote on a new photo, taken after he used white paint to give the newly-minted Whole Foods heart a more slanted-eye, sinister, and very Comme glare.
