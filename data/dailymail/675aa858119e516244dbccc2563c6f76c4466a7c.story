A single mother was targeted by ‘sex-hungry’ men after a fake dating profile was set up in her name.

Lynn Gunning's fake profile on the Plenty of Fish website said she was 'up for anything' and invited men to meet her at Boots, where she works as a sales assistant.

The mother-of-two said she was 'beside herself' when a series of men turned up expecting sex.

Ms Gunning, 45, from Sunderland, said she did not know her details had been used until a man approached her and showed it to her on his phone.

She said: 'It said I was up for anything so you can imagine the type of men that turned up.

'I said I didn’t know what he was talking about and he showed me it on his phone.

'All you need is a photo of someone, and anyone with a very sick and twisted mind could do what was done to me.'

Ms Gunning, who has been divorced for 10 years, lives with her 17-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son who suffers from autism.

She said the ordeal made her fear for her children’s safety.

Ms Gunning said: 'It was an absolutely awful time.

'My family were really concerned, and I was beside myself when the men were coming into work.

'I was so scared that they could follow me home.'

She contacted Northumbria Police, who tried to get in touch with the dating site.

After police commented on the profile, declaring it as fake, Plenty of Fish responded via email to say they had removed it.

A spokeswoman from Northumbria Police said: 'We received a report about an account that had been set up on a dating website. The account has now been deleted.

'Enquiries have been ongoing with the service provider in order to trace the email account in which the account was set up.'

Ms Gunning, who is also a student at Sunderland College, said although she is relieved the profile has been taken down she is outraged the person responsible has not been caught. 

'I want to have my story told and for people to be aware of this awful situation', she said.

'I hope this never happens to anyone else.'
