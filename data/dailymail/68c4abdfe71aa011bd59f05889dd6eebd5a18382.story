China has issued a bizarre denial of comments made by Julie Bishop to a Fairfax journalist, which prompted a tabloid attack on Australia's Foreign Minister.

China's The Global Times newspaper called Ms Bishop a 'complete fool' after she told Fairfax last week that Australia had to 'manage for the worst' when dealing with China.

But, perhaps in an attempt at smoothing diplomatic relations, China's foreign ministry has denied Ms Bishop ever said that - despite the Sydney Morning Herald publishing excerpts from the interview to prove it.

In a statement released by Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hong Lei, China said Ms Bishop never made the remarks and 'the Australian side has clarified that with the Chinese side through diplomatic channel'.

Australia's history of human rights was also targeted in the original Global Times article, who described the country as a place once 'roamed by rascals and outlaws' that would soon adjust to the shifting realities of power.

'Australia's history is not short of records of human rights infringement on the aboriginal population,' the Global Times reported in its Chinese and English editions on Monday.

'The country used to be a place roamed by rascals and outlaws from Europe. Perhaps it has to boast its values to cover up its actual lack of confidence in front of Western countries.'

The newspaper's editorial described the Foreign Minister as a 'complete fool' as it responded to the comments made by Ms Bishop in the Fairfax interview.

The Chinese editorial compared Ms Bishop's comments to that of Prime Minister Tony Abbott when he told Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last week that he 'admired the skill and the sense of honour' of the Japanese troops who attacked Sydney Harbour during World War II.

'If Abbott's words were meant to flatter his visiting Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe, Bishop's provocation appeared to have come out of nowhere,' the editorial read.

'The current Australian government has been widely considered as inexperienced, particularly in dealing with foreign relations. Still, the naivety of its foreign minister still surprised Chinese people.

'China is Australia's biggest trade partner and has not offended Australia in any way. Bishop's verbal provocation made her look more like one of the often pointless 'angry youths' found in the Chinese cyber sphere than a diplomat.'

Australia has relied heavily on the Chinese market in exports  so the Federal Government's stance on China will fluctuate, according to the newspaper.

'Bishop calls for standing up to China, but what resources does she have to do so with? The next day, Australian leaders will smile at China again, just as they do now to Japan,' it read.

'For many Chinese people, Australia is a good place for business, travel and higher education. That's about it. There is no point in China being overly upset by Bishop's words.'

The Sydney Morning Herald today published an excerpt of the original interview between Ms Bishop and journalist John Garnaut, where they were discussing Australia's relationship with China.

'Bishop: Well, we're pragmatic and we're realistic. We know that the optimum is deeper engagement ... but we're also clear-eyed about what could go wrong. And so you have to hope for the best but manage for the worst.'
