Duck Dynasty patriarch Phil Robertson believes AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases are God's penalty for the 'immoral conduct' carried out by gay people.

The reality TV star, who was briefly suspended from the A&E show last year after likening homosexuality to bestiality in a GQ interview, made his latest round of anti-gay comments during a Christian radio show as part of a tour to promote his new book.

'God says, "One woman, one man," and everyone says, "Oh, that's old hat, that's that old Bible stuff",' he told host Tony Perkins, head of the Family Research Council, Think Progress reported.

Speaking out: Reality TV star Phil Robertson, pictured at the Republican Leadership Conference in May, has said gay people are stricken with horrible sexually transmitted diseases because of their 'immoral conduct'

'But I'm thinking, well let's see now. A clean guy - a disease-free guy and a disease-free woman - they marry and they keep their sex between the two of them. They're not going to get chlamydia, and gonorrhea, and syphilis, and AIDS. It's safe.'

He continued: 'To me, either it's the wildest coincidence ever that horrible diseases follow immoral conduct, or, it's God saying, "There's a penalty for that kind of conduct." I'm leaning towards there's a penalty toward it.'

He failed to mention that a disease-free man having sex with another disease-free man - or a disease-free woman having sex with another disease-free woman - would produce the same results.

Robertson also did not touch upon his own previous conduct, which did not keep sexual relations between one man and one woman when he reportedly cheated on his wife, Kay.

They are just the latest controversial comments from Robertson, who has unapologetically maintained his anti-gay stance, despite briefly being removed from Duck Dynasty last year. 

Fan favorite: Robertson, right, and his family make up the cast of Duck Dynasty. A&E briefly removed him from the show at the end of last year after he made anti-gay remarks during an interview with GQ magazine

In an interview with GQ last December, the millionaire duck hunter launched into his first attack.

'Everything is blurred on what’s right and what's wrong. Sin becomes fine,' he said in an interview with GQ last year. 'Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there.

Being heard: He made the comments during a book tour for his new book, unPHILtered

'Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men... Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers - they won't inherit the kingdom of God.

'Instead of acknowledging their sin, they railed against me for giving them the truth about their sins. Don't deceive yourselves'  

He also grouped homosexuals with terrorists, saying, 'We never, ever judge someone on who's going to heaven, hell. That's the Almighty's job. We just love 'em, give 'em the good news about Jesus - whether they're homosexuals, drunks, terrorists. We let God sort 'em out later, you see what I'm saying?'

After the interview emerged, Robertson was put on indefinite hiatus from Duck Dynasty.

While his removal was lauded by gay rights organizations, fans of the show and conservative supporters, including Sarah Palin, denounced it as a violation of his right to free speech.

A&E initially said his views were 'disappointing' but two weeks later, they announced that Robertson would be included when they began filming again in the new year.

His rants have continued, including in a sermon at a West Monroe, Louisiana church in May when he said people had lashed out at him 'for giving them the truth about their sins'.

In an ABC News interview last week, he defended himself again, saying: 'I'm as much of a homophobe as Jesus was,. The people who are participating in homosexual behavior, they need to know that I love them.'
