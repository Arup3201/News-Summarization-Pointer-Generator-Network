A trainee hairdresser whose boss offered her £10,000 for sex has won her claim of harassment.

Maryam Mashayekhi's married manager Christopher Story made the indecent proposal in his car outside a hotel where they were styling hair for a wedding.

Mrs Mashayekhi, 34, said the father of two systematically humiliated, bullied and sexually harassed her over a period of six months while she was working for him at Toni & Guy in Sheffield city centre.

She said he questioned her about her sex life in front of colleagues, racially abused her and told a client she was a prostitute.

Mrs Mashayekhi described how she 
and Mr Story were waiting to style a bride’s hair on her 
wedding day when he asked: ‘How much money do you want to have sex?’

She told him she would not do that for anyone because she was married.

She said he then asked: ‘Are you 
having sex for £1,000, what about £2,000 or £10,000?’ She responded: 
‘No, not even for £20,000. I love my husband.’

Later the same day, Mr Story pulled her head down towards his groin as if she was about to engage in a sexual act and gave her cash so an onlooker would believe she was a prostitute.

Weeks into the job, Mr Story asked 
about her sexual preferences in front of colleagues, she claimed.

‘I 
was shocked,’ said Mrs Mashayekhi, who was born in Iran and came to 
Britain in 2005. ‘I don’t know the culture but in my culture you are not
talking to people like that.’

She said the 39-year-old asked her in front of other staff: 'You are Iranian, do you do it doggy style as well?'

The tribunal was told sexual 
banter at the salon was commonplace. Mr Story said in a statement: ‘Many
of the staff are young and the topic of conversation can sometimes 
relate to sex.’

'Discrimination': Hairdresser Maryam Mashayekhi with her husband Manouchehr Royan. The couple have been married for eight years

Mrs Mashayekhi, who has been married 
for eight years, worked on average 67 hours a week for low pay after 
starting in the salon in May 2010, the Sheffield employment tribunal was told.

The former artist said Mr Story called her ‘stupid’ on a 
daily basis, knocking her self-confidence and leading to her eventually 
leaving work with depression in November 2010.

Mr
Story claimed she had marriage problems and thought her husband was 
beating her. When she denied this, he replied: 'Asian men are aggressive
and don't respect women's rights.'

He asked if she was claiming benefits and she replied that she had to make ends meet because her wages were so low. Mr Story replied: 'You're just like these Asians that come over here to claim benefits. You're just a scrounger like the rest of them.'

The tribunal heard she was asked by a 
businessman in the salon one evening what she did before working there 
and Mr Story interjected with the comment: ‘She is a prostitute.’

Mr Story denied calling her a prostitute and said the wedding incident allegation was 'wildly inaccurate and extremely offensive' and he did not ask her if she had sex 'doggy style'.

He said: 'I did not offer to pay her in return for sex nor did I push her head towards my groin.'

Upmarket: Mrs Mashayekhi worked for Mr Story at this Toni & Guy salon in Sheffield city centre

The employment judge ruled that Mrs 
Mashayekhi and her husband, who supported his wife at the hearing, were 
'close as a couple' and he accepted her evidence on the main complaints 
of sex and race discrimination.

The panel decided the boss had joked 
in a 'wholly inappropriate way' over the 'indecent proposal' and the 
claimant felt 'very angry, humiliated and helpless' over the groin 
incident.

Mr Story's comment that Asian men did not respect women's rights was 'stereotypical, untrue and inaccurate.'

He had insulted her about her marriage, which was a happy one, used racial stereotypes, harassed her through a lack of discretion and bullied her by calling her work 'rubbish'.

Mr Story had developed a 'cult of the personality' at the salon and was popular with staff and customers. 'Our analysis of his character and personality led us to the conclusion that he was quite capable of lewd conduct in jest but insensitive to the feelings of those to whom it was directed,' said the judge.

The tribunal panel decided Mr Story's conduct 'violated her dignity' and created an 'offensive environment' for Mrs Mashayekhi.

Employment Judge Sneath said: 'We find that coupled with the incidents of racial and sexual harassment the impact was to undermine the claimant's confidence and to sap her ability to withstand long hours of work so that she became ill and succumbed to depression.'

Mr Story's conduct was 'calculated or likely to destroy mutual trust and confidence' and he concluded: 'He had no reasonable or proper excuse for his conduct nor could he.'

Mrs Mashayekhi, who lives in Sheffield city centre, has already been awarded £1,057 by the tribunal for a shortfall in holiday pay and wages.

The panel found George Plus One Ltd, the Toni and Guy franchise of which Mr Story's accountant wife Samantha is the sole director, constructively and unfairly dismissed the claimant and Mr Story was found guilty of sex and race discrimination.

A remedy hearing will be held at a later date.
