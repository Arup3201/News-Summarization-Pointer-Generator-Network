A judge said he was powerless to hand a jail term to female Tube passenger who hurled 'fascist' insults at commuters and instead had to give her a £210 fine.

Rebecca Afeigan, 29, was told she deserves to be sent to prison after she forced the suspension of the Piccadilly line as she hurled abuse at fellow passengers.

She kicked and spat at a Polish man because she could not understand his accent and told a black man to 'go home to Africa'.

Her vile outburst continued until Tube staff were forced to evacuate the train while police were called to the scene.

District Judge Michael Snow told her: 'On a packed commuter train, you racially abused someone because of the colour of their skin. You racially abused a second person because, with his accent, it was not immediately obvious he was speaking English.

'You used a classic fascist reply of: "You are here taking our jobs and taking our money".

'How rich to hear something like that from someone like you.

‘This is a society based on tolerance, and that’s what is its strength. You have made no contribution to society, you regularly take from it, are still abusing drugs and assaulting our citizens. 

‘When someone behaves like you, it trashes the image we have held out to the world'. 

The Judge went on to brand Afeigan a national embarrassmemt and lamented the fact he could not send her to prison.

He said she had an ‘appalling’ criminal record of 18 convictions but told her the maximum penalty available for her latest misdeed is a fine.

Afeigan, a cocaine and alcohol addict, launched her torrent of abuse after accusing the black man of pushing her on a Piccadilly Line train between Manor House and Turnpike Lane.

Prosecutor Darren Watts told the Westminster Magistrates' Court: 'A Polish man spoke out and told the defendant her behaviour was not acceptable. The defendant then racially abused this man, saying he was taking jobs and was a drain on the system.

'When the train pulled into Turnpike Lane station, Afeigan, who is also black, told the Polish man to "get off the train", but when he refused she began kicking him and spitting at him. She was also heard to say "I will stab you in the face” Staff had to clear the whole train of passengers as the defendant refused to get off.'

Afeigan was eventually arrested by officers waiting for the train at Arnos Grove station.

Afeigan's record includes four theft convictions between 1999 and 2004, seven sentences for possession of drugs, two assaults in 2008, and assault occasioning actual bodily harm in 2010.  

Earlier this year Afeigan was locked up for 23 weeks for assault and is currently subject to a 12 week sentence suspended for 12 months for possession of an offensive weapon. The suspended sentence was not activated today because she committed the Tube abuse before being sentenced for possessing the weapon.

Afeigan, who also has a 1999 conviction for cruelty to an animal, has disobeyed court orders three times and turned up 30 minutes late for court this afternoon.

When she tried to apologise for her actions, Judge Snow said: ‘Talk is cheap. You are violent and a racist, in my opinion, and ought to be going to prison'.

The Judge fined her £210, ordered to pay £85 costs and a £15 victim surcharge after pleading guilty to racially aggravated harassment. She will pay £10 every two weeks until the fine is cleared, and faces jail if she fails to pay up in time
