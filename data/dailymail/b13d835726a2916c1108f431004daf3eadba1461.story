A pilot on Russian national airline Aeroflot branded Ukrainians 'filth' in a cockpit message while flying over the country and is a racist homophobe who calls them 'scum' and 'killers' on his open social media websites.

In a series of sickening posts, Oleg Bugaev, 30, repeatedly uses offensive terms to describe the people of the Ukraine, jokes about the MH17 tragedy and a helicopter being shot down. 

The posts have come to light as tension between the two countries remains high after Russia annexed the southern Crimea peninsula in March and continues to back rebels in eastern Ukraine.  

Russian Aeroflot pilot Oleg Bugaev claims he was misquoted when he was accused of calling Ukrainians filth during an August flight from Moscow to Vienna 

On his open social media websites Bugaev repeatedly refers to Ukrainians as filth, Nazis and scum. He also makes light of the MH17 Malaysian Airlines tragedy which killed 298 people when it was shot down over Ukraine

Bugaev's 'filth' outburst stunned passengers on a scheduled passenger flight from Moscow to Vienna in August, which was tweeted by Slovakian diplomat Martin Kaco.

Kaco wrote: ''En route by Aeroflot to VIE, captain to passengers: 'We fly over remnants of Ukraine, where Banderovtsi and other filth lives.''

The pilot's words referred to Stepan Bandera, seen as a fascist by many Russians for colluding with Nazi Germany but a hero by many Ukrainians for seeking an independent state not controlled by Moscow. 

Aeroflot did not apologise for the outburst but five days after Kaco's original complaint, they tweeted a reply. 

'We've studied your message,' they wrote. 'The fact was confirmed. The pilot had no right to express his personal opinion while on duty... In this case the pilot has violated our internal regulations. We have started the internal investigation.' 

Supporting Russian separatists Bugaev wrote: 'Ukrainian invaders, go away from Russian land'

With a delicately placed Nazi swastika, Bugaev posted a cartoon alongside the caption: 'Donetsk is not Kiev'

Bugaev expressed his support for Russian leader Vladimir Putin in yet another anti-Ukrainian post on his social media site

But they have repeatedly declined MailOnline requests to reveal the outcome or whether Bugaev was grounded or disciplined.

Using an online forum for flight crew Bugaev, who has been flying with Aeroflot since 2007, confessed that he was wrong to make the comments but claimed that he had been misquoted. 

'I am that very captain who allegedly abused the Ukrainian people,' he wrote 'My words were flipped 180 degrees. Abuse was added to them and even words I do not know. 

He added: 'I have discussed it with the management. Of course, I confess it that I was wrong. I violated Aeroflot's standards by having added that we were flying over the remnants of Ukraine.' 

But his seemingly contrite words do not match the vitriol on his own social media account on which he repeatedly uses the word 'filth' to describe Ukrainians. 

Next to a picture of an empty grave, Bugaev who is married to 27-year-old Tatiana with whom he has a two-year-old daughter, wrote: 'The only way Bandera filth can get the lands of the south east (Ukraine).'

Bugaev wrote: 'Nobody has ever put Donbass on its knees and no one will do'

Referencing Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko, who made his fortune in the confectionery business, Bugaev calls him a 'chocolate gay'   

On another of his hate filled diatribes he declared: 'Bandera scum you are not my brother', while next to a picture of a man with a noose he wrote: 'Pray, Bandera, bastard.' 

In another post the pilot declares "No place for Nazis on our land" showing a map of Novorossiya that imagines Ukraine as a rump landlocked state totally cut off from access to the Azov and Black seas. 

He also branded Baroness Ashton - the former EU foreign affairs chief - as 'Eurohorse' while another image declared: 'EuroNazis will not pass'.

Apparently alluding to Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko who made his fortune in chocolate, he wrote: 'Chocolate gay get off Donbass.'

A picture of a Russian boot kicking out Ukrainians from the east of their country is captioned: 'Invaders go home.' 

Making light of the Malaysian Airlines MH17 tragedy which killed 298 people, including 10 Britons, he blames the Ukrainian forces for the tragedy. 

'The tradition of the Ukrainian army is to hit a plane once every 13 years,' he stated flippantly.

Both pro-Russian separatists and the Ukraine have blamed each other for the tragedy. 

Alongside his tirades  also posted pictures showing him on foreign trips in Germany, Dubai, Hurgada, and Luanda in Nigeria. 

Seeking to explain his anger towards Ukrainians, on the flight crew forum he said was raised in 'beautiful' Lugansk, a region now substantially separatist hands, less than 50 miles from the Russian border.   

'My house in Lugansk where I spent all my childhood with my parents was destroyed by Grad artillery,' he wrote. 'At the end of July I took my relatives away from Lugansk - two women with a small child, they live with me now and are still recovering. Their husbands stayed there in the (separatist) self-defence, to protect their land and houses.' 

He added: 'At the border with Novorossiya, in Donetsk town of Rostov region, I met people who were on the run, and I have never seen so much human suffering. These people have lost all they had at once but still they were happy to get out of the hell and to be alive.'

Accepting he went too far in his flight deck remarks, he thanks other pilots 'for your support' adding: 'I am so pleased to experience our Slavic nation getting together'.

He claimed: 'I was stupid to blurt out too much, but I abused nobody.'
