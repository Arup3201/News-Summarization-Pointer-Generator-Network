Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has warned against Gareth Southgate and Roy Hodgson picking his young England stars for next summer's European Under 21 Championships and then, if qualified, Euro 2016 the following campaign.

Senior England internationals Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Calum Chambers and Jack Wilshere are all eligible to represent England at the U21 tournament in the Czech Republic next year.

On Wednesday Three Lions boss Hodgson revealed he has given U21 chief Southgate the pick of his senior squad for next summer’s Euro 2015 tournament.

However, Wenger believes his young stars will face burnout if selected - which will damage England's chances of progressing far in Euro 2016.

'It depends. If Roy Hodgson wants to do well at the European Championship, I don't think it's in his interest to overload the players during the summer preceding the European Championship,' he said at Arsenal's press conference on Friday.

'The European U21 [tournament begins] on June 17. Our training starts at the beginning of July, then you count 50 to 55 games [in the club season] and then going to the European Championship without any holiday.

'I don't think that's ideal for the preparation of the English European campaign.'

In October Oxlade-Chamberlain revealed he would relish the opportunity to represent the U21s next summer, but Wenger added on Friday that if that was the case he would speak to Hodgson.

Asked if he would he leave it to the players to decide for themselves or question Hodgson, the 65-year-old was unequivocal when he said 'Come on, Roy...'
