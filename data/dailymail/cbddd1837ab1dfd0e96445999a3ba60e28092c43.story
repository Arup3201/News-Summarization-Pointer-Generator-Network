One person was killed and five injured in two separate violent attacks at BET Awards pre-show parties in Los Angeles.

Police say a man has been shot dead and four were wounded when a gunman opened fire at Monalizza Restaurant and Banquet Hall in East Hollywood about 5.15am Sunday.

In a separate incident, Madison says a man was stabbed in the stomach on Saturday night at the Lure nightclub.

The two events ahead of Sunday night's show were 'unauthorized and unaffiliated with the BET Awards,' BET said in a statement.

'The network and all organizers will continue to maintain a safe environment for all planned activities,' the statement said.

Police say a man in his 30s
 was stabbed after a fight broke out at a different party hosted by 
rapper Meek Mill at Lure Nightclub in Hollywood about 9pm Saturday.

Video obtained by TMZ showed the victim lying on the sidewalk outside the Ivar Avenue club waiting for help to arrive.

His

 friend was pressing down on the man's stomach and yelling for an 
ambulance as police mill around but make no moves to help the victim. 

'This is my fam right here, this is my brother, man!' the desperate man called, begging police to get him an ambulance.

'Hang on bro, hang on. Just relax, relax,' he tells his friend.

The victim was eventually taken to Cedars-Sinai where he is 
listed in stable condition.

Rapper The Game is believed to have been in attendance at the party.

Revelers: The party was shut down after the stabbing

TMZ reported that The Game, Lil Boosie, Mase and actress Kyla Pratt attended the party.

The Wrap reported
 three of the victims from Sunday's shooting incident were rushed to hospital by ambulance, where one 
man died a short time later. Two other victims were taken to hospital in 
private vehicles.

Los Angeles police officer Drake Madison says it's not clear if the gunman fired inside or outside the  Vermont Avenue venue.

CBS footage of the mayhem showed partygoers filing out of the club as paramedics treated the victims.

Police said both incidents are being investigated and no arrests have been made. The victims' identities have not been released.

LAPD officer Drake Madison said the parties was related to the BET Awards, but not part of the official events.

The BET Awards are taking place at the Nokia Theater in LA on Sunday evening with Chris Rock as host.

Rock didn't mention the violence at the show that marks the best in black entertainment. He won over the audience with jokes about Donald Sterling, the hit series Scandal and rapper Rick Ross. He called the BET Awards the 'black World Cup.'

On the red carpet, rapper Nelly said of the violence: 'You can't place (the blame) on BET.'

R&B singer Ne-Yo had not heard about the incidents until arriving at the show, but he said he doesn't fear for his safety at industry parties and events.

'I feel like the energy I give off is the energy I get back, and I don't give off that kind of energy,' he said.

As the show kicked off, a tearful August Alsina, nominated for four honors, won the night's first award for best new artist:

'I represent the struggle,' the New Orleans newcomer said onstage. 'This award is not for me, it's for the people.'

Drake, Beyonce and Jay Z are top nominees with five each. Drake, who was originally set to perform, will not attend, BET said Sunday.

A representative for Beyonce also said the singer wouldn't attend, and her husband's rep wouldn't divulge if Jay Z would be there or not. Their attendance had nothing to do with the violence at the weekend parties.

Drake didn't attend last year's show, where he won video of the year. This year, the 27-year-old rapper's Worst Behavior is nominated for the top prize, competing with Beyonce's Drunk in Love and Partition, as well as Pharrell's Happy and Chris Brown's Fine China.

Beyonce and Jay Z launched a co-headlining stadium tour days ago. She is nominated for best female R&B/pop artist, with little competition aside from Rihanna, while her husband will battle Drake, Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole and Future for best male hip-hop artist.

Pharrell scored four nominations, including best male R&B/pop artist, best collaboration for Robin Thicke's Blurred Lines and the viewer's choice award. Beyonce, Drake, Alsina and Jhene Aiko are also up for the fan-voted award.

Thicke, who is set to release his new album, Paula - an ode to his wife, Paula Patton, whom he is separated from - on Tuesday, will perform Sunday. Usher, Mary J. Blige and Iggy Azalea will also take the stage.

Minaj and Azalea - whose anthemic Fancy has spent its fifth week on top of the Billboard charts - will compete for best female hip-hop artist, an award Minaj has won consecutively for four years.

Lionel Richie will be honored with a lifetime achievement award at the show, where presenters include Kerry Washington, Kevin Hart and Gabrielle Union.
