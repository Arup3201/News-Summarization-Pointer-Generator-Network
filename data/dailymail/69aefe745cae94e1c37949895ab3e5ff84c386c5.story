The brutal murder of Clare Wood at the hands of her ex-boyfriend led to new laws being introduced to protect women from men with a violent history.

Leading the charge for change was Clare's heartbroken father, Michael Wood, a retired prison officer from Batley, West Yorkshire, who would never had imagined he would one day be rallying MPs and making impassioned speeches in the Palace of Westminster.

This year Clare's Law (officially called the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme), was finally passed five years after her murder. Now her father has spoken of his grief and how her death forced him to fight for justice. 

Crime that shook Britain: Clare was murdered by her boyfriend George Appleton but her legacy has resulted in a law to help other women find out about their partner's violent pasts

Unexpected campaigner: Clare's father, pictured with her when she was younger, felt he had to fight for justice for other women following his daughter's death

He said of the campaign: 'I was handed a baton, which I really couldn't put down. The more I held onto it, the bigger it got. It sparked something off in the media, the papers; I was inundated. 

'I ended up talking in the Palace of Westminster. I ended up talking to women's groups. Before Clare died, I wouldn't have said boo to a goose. But I was encouraged on by people who said "You're doing right. What you're asking is common sense."'

Mr Wood called for a change in the law and better communication between police forces so that women can be given information about a partner's previous history of violence if they request it.

The law has now been implemented but it came too late for single mother Clare, 36, who was strangled and set on fire by her ex-boyfriend George Appleton at her home in Salford, Greater Manchester, in February 2009.

Clare had met her killer on Facebook and had no idea he had a history of violence against women. However, she soon discovered his aggression and had contacted the police on various occasions to complain against offences he had committed against her. 

When she tried to leave him, he committed the fatal attack and then later killed himself. 

In a new interview for a documentary, 'Crimes That Shook Britain' on the Crime and Investigations channel, Mr Wood said he had taken an 'instant dislike' to Appleton and knew he was 'basically rotten' when his daughter brought him home.  

He said he tried to dissuade Clare from continuing their relationship to no avail.

However, despite his misgivings about Appleton, he had no idea at the time about the terrible way he was treating his daughter 

All the way to Downing Street: Michael's actions led to Clare's Law being passed as the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme. He's pictured here with his partner Elizabeth, left, and MP Hazel Blears

He said: 'To find out that my daughter had been interviewed by the police on five or six occasions, that there’d been a stopper put on her letterbox because he had threatened to pour petrol and set the house on fire. If I had known, I would have been down there in a second I really would. 

'I'm not the tallest of fellas, and I've met bully boys all through my life, and bullying doesn't stop at the playground gates, it continues in life. And I had recognised that in George Appleton too late.' 

On the night she died, Appleton went to Clare’s house and strangled her in her bed then set her body on fire.

'To know that a member of my family spent their last minutes on this earth kicking, screaming and fighting. Because some idiot couldn't take no for an answer. It leaves me dumbfounded, it really does,' Mr Wood said. 

He added: 'Even now it still puzzles me. The mentality of George Appleton to take my daughter's life and then take his own. For what?! What the hell did any of it achieve?! Nothing! Nothing!'

But Mr Wood has been able to achieve something after campaigning for Clare's Law which was championed by MPs including Hazel Blears and Theresa May.   

The bereft father said he knew he had to do something to prevent another family suffered like he had.

Gone but not forgotten: Michael can't bring his little girl back but he wanted to prevent other women becoming victims of domestic violence

He said: 'It dawned on me that for every person like me or every girl that was killed like Clare, I likened it to like dropping a pebble into a pond. There was two parents, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunties, grannies, family and friends all with the same sorrow, the same grief, the same mental torture of "why didn't I see it coming?"'

But he admits while Clare's Law will never pout an end to domestic violence, he hopes it will go some way to helping other sufferers.

It is this thought that allows him some peace and hope after his years of grieving.

He said: 'I would like to think that now at least one girl in the UK who had the sense to go to the bobbies and say, "has he?" escapes what happened to my kid. And that would be just the icing on the cake. I ask for no more than that. If I've saved one, I'll be delighted.'

Speaking on the documentary, Theresa May said the implementation of Clare's Law shows progress is being made but there is still a long way to go to end domestic violence. 

She said: 'Sadly the figures that we see for violence against women and girls remain quite stubborn. I mean it's quite difficult to change those. But I think the changes that the government has made; I think the new tools and powers we've introduced are an important part of changing. 

'But it is about changing culture and attitudes as well. There is still a lot more to do. The government has done a lot but there is a lot more work to do and we will continue to focus on this because I want to see an end to violence against women and girls. I want to see an end to domestic violence. It is an abhorrent crime.'
