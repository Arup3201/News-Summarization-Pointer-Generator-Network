Parents are furious that a firm is selling cans of an energy drink called 'Cocaine' in a busy shopping centre.

Jeb Kenneth, 51, is selling the drink in Freshney Place in the Lincolnshire town of Grimsby - with the tagline 'Get high on life, not on drugs'.

Mr Kenneth, who describes himself as the director and brand originator of the drink, owns Cocaine Ltd and says the drink has been given the name to 'shock in order to grab people's attention'.

Can of coke? An energy drink called 'Cocaine' was on sale at a shopping centre in Grimsby, drawing an angry reaction from parents. The entrepreneur behinf the drink, Jeb Kenneth, has defended the name

The Lincoln man has been selling it from a temporary stall in the shopping centre for the past few weeks.

He claimed the company had successfully sold the product at the Clothes Show in Birmingham and said he had received 'plenty of support' from customers in Grimsby

However, one parent, who did not wish to be named, said: 'If my 10-year-old came home from town telling me she had bought this drink, I don't know what I'd do.

'It's disgusting that somebody has authorised them to sell it.'

'Kids are going to see the name. It is obviously not cocaine but it is misleading for young people,' she added.

She has made a formal complaint to the Freshney Place and the centre now says Mr Kenneth's temporary trading licence would not be renewed.

Centre director Amanda Austin said: 'We can confirm that Cocaine Ltd is trading here on a trial basis and this will come to an end on June 22.

'Customer satisfaction is very important to us. The team at Freshney Place has listened to customer feedback regarding Cocaine Ltd, and have therefore decided not to renew the company's temporary trading licence at the centre.'

'Although the brand name is Cocaine Ltd, the company's intention is to promote a positive message about the dangers of taking illegal substances and of anti-social behaviour, by retailing quality products including an energy drink.

Following a complaint, the shopping centre decided not to renew the company's temporary trading licence

'They aim to deliver positive awareness and equip the new generation with knowledge about these issues.

'Whilst we appreciate this, we are also aware that the brand name has caused concern amongst some of our shoppers and we'd like to reassure customers that this was not the intention of the centre, and also extend our apologies for any concern caused.'

Mr Kenneth said that far from glorifying the drug cocaine, the product was trying to push people away from the social pressures behind illegal substances.

He said his firm did not sell the drink to anyone under 16.

'The point of the name is using the brand to create awareness of not dying young, but getting high on life, rather than glamourising drugs,' he said.

He said he wanted to raise awareness of the dangers of substances as well as of unprotected sex, the consequences of unplanned pregnancies and the dangers of anti-social behaviour and crime.

'The more you become aware of the dangers, the less likely you are to get yourself into difficulties.

'The name is what we need to grab people's attention. I have no concerns at all and people have been understanding.

'Drugs are taken because of social pressures and we are raising awareness of playing it safe because of the dangers of illegal substances.'
