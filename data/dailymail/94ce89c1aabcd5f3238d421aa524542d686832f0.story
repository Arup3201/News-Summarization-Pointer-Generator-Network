Michael Portillo steps out in the spring sunshine with a female researcher from one of his TV shows who is 34 years his junior.

The married former Tory Cabinet Minister was photographed leaving Erica Gornall’s flat in affluent Primrose Hill in north-west London.

Looking relaxed, the pair walked away side by side with their hands in their pockets, mirroring each other’s body language.

Stepping out: Married BBC presenter Michael Portillo, 60, is seen leaving the London flat of Great British Railway Journeys researcher Erica Gornall, aged 26

Mr Portillo, 60, and Miss Gornall, 26,
 who insist they are just good friends, got to know each other when she 
worked on his popular BBC2 series Great British Railway Journeys in 
2011.

The ex-Conservative MP
 was dressed casually in dark blue trousers with an open-necked bright 
blue shirt and a grey tweed jacket when he met Miss Gornall at her home 
in the heart of the fashionable London district, which has been home to 
Kate Moss, Jude Law and the Miliband brothers.

The
 accomplished young journalist, who has also worked on the BBC’s 
Panorama, Watchdog and Newsnight programmes, opted for a pale outfit of 
white jeans, a cream trenchcoat and a light pink pashmina.

They were seen together again two nights later walking to Primrose Hill’s acclaimed Michael Nadra restaurant for dinner.

Mr
 Portillo, this time wearing a more formal combination of a white shirt 
and dark tie with a black overcoat, walked Miss Gornall home and bade 
her goodnight with a kiss on the cheek, the Sunday Mirror reported.

Michael Portillo has been married to Carolyn Eadie since 1982, but has allegedly had several affairs during their 32 years together (pictured:  the couple in 2003)

The
 Cambridge-educated former defence secretary has been married to his 
wife Carolyn since 1982, although in 1999 he spoke of how he had 
‘homosexual experiences’ as a young man.

Over
 the years there have been several reports alleging that he had affairs,
 including claims that he was romantically involved with the unnamed 
wife of a millionaire banker, a former lingerie model and a Hungarian 
blonde.

Mr Portillo has 
forged a successful career in the media since he famously lost his seat 
at the 1997 general election and stood down as an MP for good in 2005.

As
 well as his long-running series celebrating the romance of classic 
train journeys in the UK and beyond, he has regularly appeared on BBC 
politics discussion show This Week and BBC Radio 4 ethical debate 
programme The Moral Maze.

He could not be reached for comment today, but he told the Sunday Mirror that he and Miss Gornall were just friends.

Miss
 Gornall studied at the London School of Economics, where she wrote for 
the university paper The Beaver and broadcast for its station Pulse 
Radio, according to a profile on her website.

After
 graduating, she ‘swapped student politics for Westminster’ by becoming a
 researcher for veteran BBC political documentary-maker Michael 
Cockerell.

She dismissed any suggestions that she was romantically involved with Mr Portillo yesterday (Sun).

Speaking
 from her parents’ semi-detached house in a quiet cul-de-sac in Eynsham,
 Oxfordshire, she said: ‘We are just friends. We have known each other 
for quite a while and we are very good friends, but just friends and 
that is all it is.’
