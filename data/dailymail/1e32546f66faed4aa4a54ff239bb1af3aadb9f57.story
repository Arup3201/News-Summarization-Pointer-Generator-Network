Andrea Pirlo could be set for a shock January move to LA Galaxy, according to reports. 

The Juventus midfielder, 35, has played in Italy his whole career but despite recently signing a new two-year contract the Galaxy are considering bringing him to the MLS.

David Beckham's former side want him as a replacement for Landon Donovan, who announced his plans to retire at the end of the 2014 MLS season.

Only last month, Pirlo said: 'Why should I move? Serie A is the top league in Italy and life is good. Two years with Juventus, then maybe I can go to the MLS in the United States.'

However, Galaxy coach Bruce Arena confirmed to ESPN: 'We are interested in players of his calibre.'

Pirlo has 112 caps for Italy.
