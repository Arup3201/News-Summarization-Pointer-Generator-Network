Opening batsman Adam Lyth has signed a three-year contract extension to keep him at Yorkshire until 2018.

The 27-year-old scored 1,489 runs at an average of almost 68 as Yorkshire won last season's LV= County Championship, earning himself a place on England Lions' ongoing tour of South Africa.

'I am delighted to be committing my long-term future to Yorkshire,' he said. 'It has been an incredible year for me and I just want to keep on improving.

'To play for this club is very special and to contribute to our recent success is why we play. I dream of winning trophies for Yorkshire and after winning the Championship, I firmly believe this will be first of many.'

Director of cricket Martyn Moxon backed the Whitby-born left-hander to go on to full international honours.

'Lythie has always had a lot of natural talent,' he said. 'What we are seeing now is a growing maturity about his batting.

'He is potentially close to an England call-up, which is testament to his ability as one of the country's leading players.'

Lyth added: 'I have enjoyed playing with the England Lions this winter and I have a strong desire to play for (the) England senior side, hopefully sooner rather than later.'
