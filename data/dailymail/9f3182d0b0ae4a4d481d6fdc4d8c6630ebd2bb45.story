Martin Skrtel was carried off on a stretcher early on in Liverpool's FA Cup quarter-final against Blackburn, after landing awkwardly on his head.

The Slovakian defender needed eight minutes of treatment on the pitch, and was carried away wearing a neck brace and has been taken to hospital as a precaution.

Skrtel landed on his head after being caught in the face by an innocuous-looking challenge from Rudy Gestede in just the second minute of the game.
