Police killer Harry Roberts was last night preparing for a new life in sheltered housing after being freed from prison.

The 78-year-old, who was jailed for life for the shooting deaths of three unarmed officers in 1966, is set to live alongside unwitting elderly people following his controversial release on Monday night.

Amid great secrecy, he was taken from Littlehey Prison in Cambridgeshire to a bail hostel in the south of England, where he will be assessed pending an expected move to warden-controlled accommodation – complete with panic alarm in case he feels threatened.

Despite spending nearly half a century in prison, he will be entitled to draw the basic state pension – £113 per week – and could also be eligible for housing allowance.

Last night there was mounting speculation that Roberts has changed his name, possibly by deed poll, to avoid being identified by fellow residents.

A leading criminal justice expert said that although Roberts has not been given a new identity, which would cost hundreds of thousands of pounds and cause an outcry, ‘it would make sense’ for him to have a new name to remain anonymous.

Harry Fletcher, a former senior official in the probation officers’ union NAPO, said: ‘Every effort will be made to ensure his whereabouts remains a secret. I expect he will spend a relatively short period of time in a bail hostel, before being switched to sheltered accommodation where fellow residents won’t realise who he is.’

Roberts was jailed for life for the murders of Det Sgt Christopher Head, 30, Det Con David Wombwell, 25, and PC Geoffrey Fox, 41, in West London in 1966. A widow subjected to a vile hate campaign at the hands of Roberts said she was ‘living in fear’.

Joan Cartwright, 71, said she felt ‘very vulnerable’ after it emerged the criminal – who has threatened to kill her and her husband – had been freed. She only learned about his release when she heard the news on the radio.

Five years ago, Roberts’s bid to be released from jail was rejected after it emerged he had terrorised Mrs Cartwright and her family when she complained about his behaviour while working on day release in her animal sanctuary in the East Midlands.

‘I feel very frightened, it’s quite terrifying,’ she told the Mail last night.

‘On the one hand the police are telling me he’s a reformed man, who’s full of remorse and that nothing is going to happen. But at the same time they are giving me code words to quote should I need to call them if we have any upset or worry.’

PC Fox’s son said he was disgusted that he received no official notification that his father’s killer had been freed.

Speaking at his home in Aylesbury, Paul Fox, 64, told the Mail: ‘No official has had the decency to tell me what is going on. I have learnt everything from the media.

‘Harry Roberts has been behind bars for more than 40 years and that is where he should have stayed. He has lived a life of luxury in prison. I feel very let down by the system.’

The Ministry of Justice said: ‘We do not comment on individuals.’
