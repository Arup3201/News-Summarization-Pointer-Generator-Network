Darren Campbell claims Commonwealth Games silver medallist Adam Gemili has 'embarrassed' the best of the rest British sprinters into stepping up their performances.

Campbell, a former Olympic relay gold medallist and Sydney 2000 runner-up over 200 metres, believes the emergence of English ace Gemili, a struggling footballer who found his true talent was in athletics, has shaken up the domestic scene.

And he also claims women's sprinting in Britain is close to a peak, after a period in his career when he contends the fastest home-grown female athletes were obsessed with 'looking pretty' above racing quick times.

Rise: Darren Campbell believes British sprinters should be embarrassed by Adam Gemili's success

Darren Campbell told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'You let a former footballer come into our sport, who's not gone through the junior ranks, through English Schools, or anything like that. He's just come in having trained for six months and he's the best in Britain.

'You should be embarrassed, the rest of you. You need to step it up. They're all having to step it up. You need the extra encouragement, the extra belief that anything is possible.

'With the women, from what I remember being back in the team, too many of them were bothered about getting in the team, getting the kit, and looking pretty.

'But now with this current crop, no, they're inspired by what they've witnessed from London 2012. They've realised they can be the best in the world.

'You look at the likes of Dina Asher-Smith going to the World Junior Championships and becoming world junior champion.

'They realised if they put in the work, train hard, they can be the best in the world. The girls are leading the way, and I think the times they performed over the 4x100m relay has given them the extra bit of confidence that they can beat the best in the world, and that's what it's about: belief.'
