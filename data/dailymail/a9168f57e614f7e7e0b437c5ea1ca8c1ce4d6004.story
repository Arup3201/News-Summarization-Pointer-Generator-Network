In my job as a comedienne/impressionist I was lucky enough to land a job on a leg of P&O Cruises' Aurora world cruise - and brought the family along.

The segment of the cruise we enjoyed was the five-day leg from Singapore to Sri Lanka.

I am glad to say that my on-board guest entertainment act seemed to go down well - though quite what the non-British passengers made of my takes on the likes of Stacey Solomon, Davina McCall and Anne Robinson I'm not too sure. But I, at least, really enjoyed it.

And here's me during a quick day off: Debra and their children hit the beach on Malaysia's Langkawi shoreline

The job presented me with the opportunity to bring my husband and our two children, aged 11 and seven, along on a voyage in a very beautiful part of the world.

My children were also able to see my act - so that they could finally understand what I do for a living.

We liked the fact that the cruise was very British: the voyage's itinerary begins and ends in Southampton, so the majority of passengers were from the UK - and on-board activities were run largely to satisfy British tastes.

My initial pleasure at being on a cruise ship was the realisation that I was to be relieved of my usual domestic chores: it was very nice, for example, to take a break from vacuuming! 

Islands of inspiration: Malaysia's Langkawi archipelago has some of the Far East's loveliest beaches

We stopped twice on our short trip, firstly in Port Klang, which serves Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur. The following day we got to see a little bit of the beautiful archipelago of Langkawi. The day we stopped there was my husband's birthday, so we decided to enjoy it on the beach.

What I love about cruising is the fact that you get a taster of these different places. Ever wondered what Malaysia is like? On a cruise you can find out in a few hours. Another surprise for first-time cruisers is that the ship is a selfcontained world of its own, with everything you could possibly want to enjoy the perfect holiday.

The food on board, for instance, is a key attraction.

Dining in the restaurant was a pleasure, not just because of the cuisine but also because of the staff: the waiters were just lovely. Our kids loved one of them so much they actually said: 'Can we keep in touch with him?'

One of the things you often hear is that people put on half a stone during a cruise.

Not me: I actually lost 6lb in a week. I know that sounds ridiculous and it sounds as if I didn't like the dishes served, but I really did.

I found that there was so much choice and I naturally gravitated towards the healthier options. Where, at home, I can be a bit lazy and just grab a calorific sandwich, on board the Aurora I was able to enjoy healthy salads and fruits.

The kids also ate well because, again, there was a lot of choice for them, and because it was all so beautifully presented they were willing to try things they had never eaten before.

It helped that they spent most of their days in the pool and were very hungry when meal times came around.

We had a few days in Sri Lanka at the end of the tour and joined some great excursions. We really enjoyed our visit to Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage, for example. I would love to go back to Singapore, our 'taster' visit really made us want to return. There was an excursion to the zoo which we didn't get to do, and we would have loved to visit the street markets too.

Cruising is like the best showbusiness act - it leaves you wanting more! Like my act, hopefully…
