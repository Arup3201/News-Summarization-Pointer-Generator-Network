Jailed: Michael Thomas, 24, mugged two elderly women in one day to fund his habit

A heroin addict who became hooked on the drug when he was just nine years old robbed a 90-year-old woman to fund his habit.

Michael Thomas, 24, attacked the frail church organist in the centre of Llanelli, south Wales - leaving her with head injuries, a broken shoulder and an injured arm.

Annie Morgan is still recovering in a nursing home and may never play her instrument again.

The drug addict then stole a bag from 76-year-old Marie Davies, who is now too frightened to leave her house, Swansea Crown Court heard.

Thomas, who was first given the Class A drug while still in junior school, was jailed today for four years.

Judge Paul Thomas said his 'stomach churned' when he saw Mrs Morgan's injuries.

Thomas, of Llanelli, south Wales, pleaded guilty to a charge of robbery and another of theft.

Huw Rees, defending, said Thomas accepted
that his actions were 'despicable' - but added that he had lost a number of close
family members in a 'short period'.

He said Thomas had first been given heroin at the age of nine and was a long-term addict.

Prosecutor John Lloyd said Mrs Morgan may never return to her home in Llanelli.

'She is still in extensive pain and feels she has lost her independence,' he added. 'She is extremely upset and tearful.'

He said that playing the organ at her church had been one of the committed Christian's 
'few enjoyments' in life.

Thomas mugged Mrs Morgan and Mrs Davies on January 11.

Mr Lloyd said: 'Mrs Davies luckily 
escaped without injury but has been left too terrified to leave the 
house or answer the door.'

Detective sergeant Ifan Charles, of 
Dyfed-Powys Police, said: 'This was a despicable crime against a 
vulnerable and elderly victim.

'We welcome the sentence imposed by the courts on this offender, and we hope it sends a very clear signal to others.

'If you commit crime you will be caught and face the consequences.'

An Age Cymru spokeswoman said: 'Everyone has a right to live their lives free of the fear of crime.

'We hope that the outcome of this case will reassure and comfort older people.

'We also hope that this case will act 
as a deterrent and send out a strong message that such abuse of older 
people will not be tolerated.'
