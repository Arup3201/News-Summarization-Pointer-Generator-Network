Fatal attraction: Amanda Logue, who did bikini modelling as well as porn, pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of second-degree murder

A porn actress accused of teaming up with her boyfriend to beat and stab a tattoo shop owner to death after a sex party two years ago has pleaded guilty to a lesser charge that will keep her behind bars for up to 40 years.

Amanda Logue, who performed in various adult films under the name Sunny Dae and had also worked as a prostitute, entered the plea on Monday in Pasco County, Florida.

Authorities said 41-year-old Dennis Abrahamsen was found stabbed and bludgeoned to death on a massage table in his New Port Richey home in May 2010.

The Tampa Bay Times reported that a cousin of Abrahamsen spoke during the hearing, calling Logue 'evil.'

Donna Rella said in court: 'You're not a person.''[Abrahamsen] had a family. You have taken him away from us all.'

Court records showed that Amanda Logue had been paid to attend a sex party at that location on the night before his body was found.

Investigators said Logue and her boyfriend Jason Andrews exchanged expletive-laden text messages before and during the party, discussing the attack.

Using his BlackBerry, Andrews allegedly typed: 'I'm so glad you're really committed to this take. Keep eyes for a knife, etc for me!'

Logue replied in a nearly incomprehensible text that she was excited - and she wanted to have sex after they killed him.

The Tampa Bay Times reported that Andrews pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in January.

According to an affidavit, everyone at the party left Abrahamsen's home around 5am May 15, 2010 - except for Logue. Andrews waited outside in his car, still texting her.

'Just get him on his face either bash or tell me to get in and. Where to go,' Andrews wrote.'K I'm horny! I'm getting him to play music,' Logue typed.

'Wicked. Ill just be waiting. Really. Take. Your. Time,' Andrews replied.

Abrahamsen was found dead in his house by a family member some 18 hours later, face down on a massage table with blood splattered on the walls and a ceiling fan.

Logue, 30, who is being held at the Pasco County Jail, originally faced first-degree murder charges, but will now face a lesser charge of second-degree murder in a deal with prosecutors.

Police in Florida say the pair killed Abrahamsen in the early morning of May 15 and swiped $6,000 cash, his credit cards and a video camera.

Abrahamsen had hired Logue to work at a sex party at his house, and police said that's when Logue and Andrews set him up.

They traded dozens of text messages about their homicidal plan, police said.

According to an affidavit, Logue would later deny that she had anything to do with the killing and claim Andrews was the one who bludgeoned Abrahamsen with a sledgehammer.

'Logue told [a detective] that Andrews grabbed the back of her hair then twisted her arm behind her back. Andrews forced her to view Abrahamsen's crushed skull and told her that's what would happen to her if she told anyone.'

Logue and Andrews met on the set of a porn video in late 2009 and became inseparable - even though Logue was married to a man in Georgia, authorities and friends said.

Andrews' Chicago friends find it difficult to believe he was involved in the killing. The 27-year-old Andrews was known in that city as DJ Veritas, and his Facebook and MySpace pages feature several video clips of him playing techno music in large clubs.

'He was a really straight up dude,' said Michael Sarkowicz, a Chicago club photographer.

Logue seemed like a decent person, said Kristen Cameron, a Florida-based model who met her last year.Â 

According to several profiles on modelling websites, Logue did bikini and fetish modelling.

'She was professional, prompt and seemed all around normal, well so I thought,' Cameron wrote in an email to Associated Press.

'She was nice to me and was a great model! I felt a connection to her since we both have southern backgrounds.'

But Cameron's opinion changed this spring when she saw how Logue acted around Andrews, her new boyfriend.

'Amanda wasn't the Amanda I knew,' Cameron wrote. 'She wouldn't talk, all she did was text with Jason.'

Andrews, Cameron said, was obnoxious and brash. He often bragged about his military service, of which Cameron was sceptical.

In April and May, according to their Twitter accounts, Logue and Andrews spent several weeks in Florida, shooting porn videos, lolling on the beach and professing their love for each other.

Photos on Logue's Facebook showed the pair grinning and hugging.
