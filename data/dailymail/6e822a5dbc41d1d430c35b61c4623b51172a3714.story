A wealthy banker who lost a disastrous divorce battle with his fashionista ex-wife has gone back to court complaining that's he's been forced to quit his lavish life in New York.

Yan Assoun, 44, says he is being forced out of his £2million condo in Manhattan, New York, and insists his ex-wife Anais Assoun, 45, has been given an 'unfair financial advantage' over him.

The former London City trader, who is believed to be French, was previously described by a judge as having spending power 'beyond the wildest dreams' of his fashion writer ex.

But now, due to a divorce judge’s ruling, he said he has undergone a drastic reversal in fortunes.

Mr Assoun says he has been left with just a fifth of his income to survive on.

Judge Glenn Brasse, presiding over the final hearing of the couple’s divorce last year, ruled that the 'reasonable needs' of Mrs Assoun and the former couple’s children amounted to almost £294,000-a-year.

The judge had earlier said of the banker: 'The husband has been able to acquire a £1.9 million apartment in Manhattan. This kind of spending ability is not within the wife’s reach, not within her wildest dreams.'

But Mr Assoun is now protesting at the Appeal Court that he will be effectively exiled from New York by Judge Brasse’s order, as he cannot now afford the cost of maintaining his lifestyle there.

Lady Justice Arden heard that Mr Assoun, majority shareholder in a banking business that turned over £4.7 million in 2012, had already handed his ex - who he met and married in London whilst working for BNP Paribas and Credit Suisse - £880,000 in assets and legal costs, prior to last year’s hearing.

Mrs Assoun, a 'well educated' woman who lives on a ranch in Texas, which she owns, earns £38,000-a-year herself, Judge Brasse found.

Her ex-husband had insisted at an earlier hearing that he was 'bust' and 'not rich' - despite owning a  condo on Broadway, one of Manhattan’s most iconic addresses, along with his business interests.

But he was found to be reaping a yearly income of more than £411,000 from his business by Judge Brasse, who went on to order him to pay the lion’s share of that to his ex-wife and children in maintenance and expenses.

He is now asking for permission to appeal the judge’s order - which he says left him with less than £88,000-a-year to live on, after tax.

That is a sum on which it will be 'very difficult to survive' in the big apple, he told Lady Justice Arden.

Judge Brasse ruled that a £411,000-a-year maintenance payment, before tax, represented his ex wife’s 'reasonable basic needs', and raised that figure to almost £294,000 when including the needs of their children.

Mr Assoun told the appeal judge he will have to start spreading the news that he is leaving his New York home if the order stands.

He added: 'The order leaves me living in New York City with an amount on which it will eventually be very difficult to survive, when paying my wife more than myself.'

Insisting that Judge Brasse had 'made a miscalculation', he said: 'The award was greater for the wife when she lives in Dallas and I live in New York City, where the cost of living is much higher.'

Criticising the judge, he added: 'I felt the judgment was so terrible...the decision led to a gross financial disparity between my ex-wife and myself.

'The judge made a calculation error which led to an unfair financial advantage for the wife.'

Lady Justice Arden directed Mr Assoun to set out the details of his challenge in writing to his ex-wife’s lawyers, who will then have a month to respond.

She said she would decide after considering Mrs Assoun’s reply whether to grant him permission to appeal.

At an earlier hearing, Mr Assoun told the court: 'I own an apartment worth £1.9 million - it doesn't mean I'm rich.'

He added: 'Speculation that a turnover of £4.7 million would automatically translate to a large income for myself, because I own 50 per cent of the company, is just wrong... I already have a huge amount of debt, I don’t have any money.'

Should Mr Assoun win permission to appeal, his case will be argued before three senior judges, with his wife’s lawyers in attendance.
