'The driver has stopped at the scene but was dragged from his vehicle by a number of people and seriously assaulted. He has then fled to a nearby address.'

The Inspector said the man, who had done the right thing by stopping to assess the situation, suffered a painful assault at the hands of the locals and said their actions will not be tolerated.  

'Such behaviour cannot and will not be tolerated. In such situations a driver is obliged to stop and ascertain any injuries.

'It is the police's role to investigate and hold people to account, not emotional bystanders,' Mr Nicholls said. 

Hamilton police are continuing to investigate the accident.
