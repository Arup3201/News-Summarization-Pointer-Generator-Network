Russian special forces are leading attacks on Donetsk airport as fighting in east Ukraine intensifies despite a two-month-old ceasefire, the country's military claims.

Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy Lysenko said there had been particularly fierce fighting at the in airport over the weekend and claimed Russian troops were involved.

'These are Russian special forces. It's already the third day that they've been trying to do something,' he told Reuters by telephone.

Pictures meanwhile showed damage to residential buildings and shops inside rebel-held Donetsk after shelling by the Ukrainian army, but there was no news of civilian casualties in the city.

Mr Lysenko's accusations came as both Ukrainian officials and Nato claimed Russia had further violated the ceasefire agreement by sending advanced weapons to rebel units.

Ukraine said yesterday that a convoy of 106 vehicles had entered its eastern territory from Russia without permission and accused Moscow of using humanitarian aid shipments to smuggle weapons and ammunition.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said: 'We see a significant military buildup in and around Ukraine. Large transfers of Russian advanced weapons, equipment and military personnel to violent separatists.'

Moscow denies using humanitarian convoys to transport weapons and rejects Western and Ukrainian accusations that it is arming the rebels and sending fighters to aid them.

It accuses the West and Kiev of pressing a campaign of indiscriminate violence in the eastern territories of Luhansk and Donetsk.

The nine-month-old conflict is thought to have killed more than 4,300 people. Despite a peace deal signed by Ukraine, Russia and separatist leaders on September 5, there have been continued attacks from both sides.

Mr Lysenko said three Ukrainian servicemen had been killed in the past 24 hours in intensified artillery strikes from the rebels that he linked to yesterday's arrival of another large aid convoy from Russia. A further 15 had been injured, according to official sources. 

'The new humanitarian convoy arrived and the terrorists received ammunition for heavy artillery ... therefore they are able to increase the intensity (of attacks),' he said.

Months of fighting in Ukraine's restive east have left many without enough food and led to severe shortages of essential medical supplies.

Russia has regularly dispatched shipments of aid, a move which the pro-Western Kiev government has denounced as a cynical operation to ship military equipment to rebels.

Commenting on yesterday's convoy, Mr Stoltenberg said the best way to improve the humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine was to stop violations of the Minsk agreement, intended to halt the conflict in eastern Ukraine, and to respect the ceasefire.

'We are seeing that the separatists and Russia (are) not doing that. Russia is fuelling the conflict by providing ... equipment and other kinds of support for the separatists and thereby undermining and violating the ceasefire and also the efforts to create a peaceful, negotiated solution,' he said.

Nato foreign ministers meet in Brussels tomorrow to discuss the situation in Ukraine and to review steps the 28-nation alliance has taken to boost its defences and to reassure nervous eastern European allies following Moscow's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region in March.

They will agree to continue the measures, which include exercises and rotations of small numbers of troops to eastern Europe, throughout 2015.
