Tony Abbott has revealed he wanted to speak with the gunman at the centre of the Sydney siege but was warned by police it could make the situation worse.

Man Haron Monis had demanded to speak with the Prime Minister over the phone after he took 18 people hostage inside the Lindt cafe at Martin Place in December.

Mr Abbott, who released the joint federal-NSW inquiry report into the terror attack on Sunday, said he only learned of the demand on the evening of the siege.

'My response was if he wants to have a conversation, of course he can. (But) advice of police was it could make a bad situation worse,' Mr Abbott said.

Tony Abbott has revealed he wanted to speak with Man Haron Monis, the gunman at the centre of the Sydney siege, but was warned by police it could make the situation worse

The inquiry report made a number of recommendations and Mr Abbott and NSW Premier Mike Baird said governments needed to learn lessons from the siege.

'Plainly, this monster should not have been in our community,' Mr Abbott said.  

'The difficulty is that while he was well and truly on a lot of radar screens, he was routinely assessed as not being a threat to himself or to the community.

'Plainly, at some stage he did become a threat. We obviously do need more checks and more scrutiny in the visa process, in the citizenship process.'

Hostages Katrina Dawson and Tori Johnson died when the 17-hour siege came to an end at the Lindt cafe in central Sydney on December 16.

The gunman was shot dead when police stormed the cafe, ending the crisis.

Mr Abbott said it was pretty obvious from the report that at every stage Monis had been given the benefit of the doubt. 

'The cumulative effect of the benefit of the doubt being given to him time and time again is that he was able to wreak havoc on our community,' Mr Abbott said. 

He says there is an ongoing debate in a society such as Australia's between the rights of the individual and the protection of the community. 

'My judgement is that while having always to respect both, the question of precisely where we draw the line in the era of terrorism will have to be reconsidered and the line may have to be redrawn,' he said. 

Mr Abbott said the report concluded decisions made by various government departments in relation to Monis were 'justifiable under the circumstances'.

Marcia Mikhael was carried out of the Lindt cafe after police stormed in shooting dead the gunman 

A total of 18 hostages were held inside the cafe for hours on December 15 with many escaping and running into the arms of police

'But plainly, in their totality, the system has let us down,' he said.

'The system has let us down because plainly this guy shouldn't have been in the country, he shouldn't have been out on bail, he shouldn't have had a gun and he shouldn't have been radicalised to the extent that he claimed to be conducting an Islamist death cult attack here in Australia.'

Australia needed to re-examine the system and ask itself if it needed to change the 'tipping point' from protection of the individual to safety of the community, according to Mr Abbott.

Mr Baird said while decisions made by the various agencies were considered reasonable by the review, the system had let the community down.

'The recommendations that have come forward - we need to act and we need to respond and we will be doing exactly that,' Mr Baird said.

The inquiry report made a number of recommendations and Mr Abbott and NSW Premier Mike Baird said governments needed to learn lessons from the siege

A permanent memorial for the victims would be in place by the anniversary of the siege, according to NSW Premier Mike Baird 

The report recommends that information about identified terror suspects should be provided as part of any bail conditions, NSW Premier Mike Baird said.

'I have a view it should actually go further,' he said.

The report also comments on the need to reduce the number of illegal firearms.

Mr Baird says there are close to 250,000 illegal firearms cross the country.

'We need to look at all options we can to ensure that we reduce the number of illegal firearms across this state and nation,' he said.

A permanent memorial for the victims would be in place by the anniversary of the siege, Mr Baird said.
