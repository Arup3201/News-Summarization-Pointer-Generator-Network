Microsoft’s attempt to rival Apple’s iPad with its own tablet may fall short due to malfunctions.

Consumers who purchased Microsoft’s new Surface tablet are voicing frustrations about the product’s faulty Touch Cover screen.

A number of early buyers of the gadget, including several tech writers and developers, have reported issues of the screen splitting and exposing an internal wire after just a few days of use, the Guardian reports.

'My touch cover, in the middle at the join to the screen is peeling, like the top layer has come loose and is ruffling up,' one Surface buyer wrote on a forum for the product. 'Worried its going to get worse as I use it more.'

The defect appears to be the same in each case -- the Surface’s cover, which has a built-in keyboard, comes apart at its seam.

It is unclear whether the screen problems are due to a bad batch or are part of a bigger issue with the gadget that will become more apparent as more people use the Surface tablet over a longer period of time.

The fact that consumers in both the U.S. and the U.K have reported the same issue with the Surface’s screen suggests that it is not isolated to a single manufacturing batch, the Guardian notes.

Users have also reported issues with the tablet’s sound, according to Geeky Gadgets.

Microsoft would not comment on the number reports of the problem the company had received.

'Microsoft makes every effort to ensure our customers receive a high quality product,' the company told CNET.
 'We are in active contact with our Customer Support operations and are 
aware of a small number of instances of material separation. Customers 
can contact Microsoft Customer Support if they have any questions.'

The Surface tablet carries a price tag of about $500 and up with the inclusion of more storage space and additional features.

The Touch Cover by itself costs about $80, though Microsoft does not charge users for swapping faulty covers.

The tablet first went on sale for pre-order on October 16. Microsoft is expected to sell millions of the devices.
