Dozens of mainly Eritreans were involved in the ugly confrontations at the port, which has been at the centre of numerous disturbances in recent weeks.

Around 250 migrants formed themselves into a gang yesterday morning and then rushed vehicles queuing to get on board ferries.

‘It was absolute chaos,’ said one officer. ‘First of all they ran at the trucks, scaring drivers and other people watching.

‘By the time police arrived they were already throwing stones and acting in a very aggressive manner. Many believe it is their legal right to get to Britain.’

When an ambulance arrived to treat one of the migrants who had fallen over and hurt his head, a crowd gathered around him and began to threaten the medics.

Barriers were torn down and a wire fence cut, said the police source, who confirmed that tear gas and baton charges were used.

Around 1,200 migrants – mainly Eritreans, Sudanese and Afghans – are currently squatting in disused buildings and temporary camps in Calais

Earlier this month, police union spokesman Gilles Debove said tear gas was necessary to stop ‘mass onslaughts’ on vehicles. He claimed there has also been an increase in mugging and sexual assaults by migrants.
