Britain's churches are at risk of turning into giant 'bat barns', a Tory peer has warned.

Lord Cormack said the flying animals were a 'terrible problem' for parishes - with the smell and mess of bat droppings proving an 'intolerable burden' for vicars.

The former Tory MP said he had been told of one occasion when a vicar had to 'shake bat faeces out of her hair while celebrating holy communion at the altar'.

The number of bats roosting in Britain's churches - particularly in East Anglia - is a menace to vicars, a leading Tory peer has claimed

He said bats were a 'menace' to churches and it was time for a fightback against nature lovers.

Tory peer Lord Ahmad, speaking for the Government, said there was a 'bat helpline' to give free advice on helping churches deal with the problem.

But Lord Cormack said: 'The impression is that bats matter much more than the worshipping community and this is exacerbated by the fact Natural England abrogated responsibility to the Bat Conservation Trust, who are quite legitimately a pressure group.'

He added: 'This is a subject that is not sufficiently aired but it really is a very true danger.

'If this debate achieved only one thing - a better balance between the demands of English Nature and the needs of English Heritage - I would be well content.'

The Bishop of Norwich, the Rt Rev Graham James, said there had been a lot of meetings with Natural England and the Government on the problem of bats and there had been some positive developments.

But he added: 'It is always odd to me that our parish churches seem to be treated much more as barns than as houses.

'They are places where people gather and to eat - not just the sacrament of holy communion but more socially as well - and I doubt any other eating place would be allowed to be so unhygienic.'

Musical impresario Lord Lloyd-Webber urged the Government to set up a national heritage memorial fund to protect and promote works of art in parish churches.

The Conservative peer said: 'We have to fight passionately for the future of our parish churches.'

He warned that protecting works of art like stained glass windows was beyond the means of some churches and suggested a fund should be created to do the job.

Lord Lloyd-Webber said anything that people could do to further the use of churches as the centre of communities had to be good.

'We should have Wi-Fi in churches,' he added.

'If we have Wi-Fi you could have an app and that app could say look this is what this building is about.'

Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon, replying to the debate for the Government, said: 'Most medieval churches will have bats and it seems that Norfolk churches seem to have particular problems in this respect.

'Historical buildings, especially churches, play an important role in helping to protect the conservation and status of native bats.

'In a changing landscape churches can represent one of the few remaining constant resources for bats, thus giving them a disproportionate significance for the maintenance of bat populations.'
