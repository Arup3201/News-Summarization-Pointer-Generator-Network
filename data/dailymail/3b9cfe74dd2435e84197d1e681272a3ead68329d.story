Despite pleading guilty to a string of child sex offences, a wealthy New South Wales businessman has avoided jail and been able to walk free on bail.

Last week, it was found that, 59 year old Maurice Van Ryn, was granted bail at Bega local court after pleading guilty to a charge involving multiple sexual and indecent assaults on children.

Nine's A Current Affair described the former CEO of Bega Cheese as one of the richest men in the small seaside town of Tathra, on the NSW far south coast and nearby Bega.

Nine's ACA launched a special investigation that found the wealthy businessman was responsible for 10 years of abusing children

ACA says he committed indecent acts against children in a home.

This went on for about 10 years until in June, an eight year old girl came forward, telling her parents she had been abused by Van Ryn.

When Greg Otton, a friend of Van Ryn's neighbour heard the news, it's believed he spread the word throughout the community which then led to six more victims, both boys and girls, coming forward.

'incredible brave young woman, a credit to her parents they could raise her to react in the way she did at such a young age,' said Mr Otton.

He says bail laws are inadequate allowing 'creeps to walk the streets' and believes the justice system is broken and needs fixing.

In Bega local court last week, Van Ryn pleaded guilty to 12 child sex offences.

But they were rolled into a more serious offence, 'persistent sexual abuse of a child', one of the country's worse child sex offences that carries the same penalty as murder, a maximum of 25 years behind bars.

He was then committed to the District Court for sentencing in February next year.

ACA also uncovered that Van Ryn also committed one of the offences in July, while on bail, citing the former corporate high flyer is taking the justice system for a ride. 

Child protection advocate Heddy Johnston told ACA she was appalled at how the case was handled.

It's not the first time the community has been victim to bail laws that have failed, when in October 1997 two Bega schoolgirls were abducted, raped and murdered by a man who was out on bail for sexual offences

'The human rights of children are being ignored,' she said. 

Now the attorney general has ordered an urgent review of Van Ryn's case and the Director of Public prosecutions is now appealing his bail decision at a special hearing on Thursday.
