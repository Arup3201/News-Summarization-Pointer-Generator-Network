A gaggle of famous tweeters has teamed up to raise £1million for Comic Relief... simply by asking their Twitter followers for the money.

Some 29 celebrities - including mother-of-two Lily Cooper (formerly Lily Allen), radio presenter Fearne Cotton, singer Olly Murs, actor and comedian Simon Pegg and TV presenters Davina McCall, Kirstie Allsopp, Claudia Winkleman - are hoping to raise the first ever 'Twitter million' for the charity by Red Nose Day on Friday.

Led by Emma Freud, director of Comic 
Relief and partner of Richard Curtis who founded the charity in 1985, 
#twittermillion has enlisted the help of famous faces who collectively 
have over 14 million followers.

This year will be the 25th anniversary for Comic Relief, which is what prompted Emma Freud, front holding 'Thank you!' sign to launch #twittermillion

Each high-profile tweeter 
has asked 1,000 of their own followers to join their team and raise £50 
each, in friendly competition against the other teams.

DIY darling Kirstie Allsopp has agreed to treat her team of merry tweeters by making home-made gifts for 20 of them as a thank-you.

Members of other tweeting teams could be in for tasty rewards - Celebrity Masterchef winner Emma Kennedy is cooking dinner for one of her fundraising followers, and Claudia Winkleman is giving out doughnuts to her doting donators.

Emma Kennedy said of #twittermillion: 'We chat to each other every day. We read each other's tweets. We're constantly connected. Wouldn't it be amazing if we all decided to do one small thing and in so doing, did something incredible?'

Organiser Emma Freud said:

'We became convinced that all that 
gorgeous chatter on Twitter could be made to add up to hard cash. Convinced!

'So 28 of the greatest Tweeters on the internet, with a 
collective following of 12 million, have begged and bribed their 
followers to join their #twittermillion teams.

'To join their team, they
just need to think of something to raise money for comic 
relief, to the tune of £50... or more!

'The competitive nature of the team
captains is such that they are competing hard to outdo each other - and
offering bribes to their followers to join their team.

'Rufus Hound is 
giving one of his team members his Triumph Limited Edition Steve McQueen
Motorbike.

'Simon Pegg is inviting one of his team to the premiere of 
Star Trek and the party afterwards to meet Benedict Cumberbatch.

'Claudia Winkleman is offering a set visit to Strictly, and the dress and
shoes she's wearing on BBC1 on Friday for Red Nose Day night.

'Carol Vorderman is giving her wardrobe. Not a wooden one, a clothing 
one.

'And Team members are rallying with
incredible personal challenges to raise the £50 for their team 
captains. My son is spending three days eating only cereal (#toughcall!), Emma Kennedy spent 25 hours camping on stage throughout Mark Watson's 25-Hour Stand Up Show, including weeing into a bucket in full view of the 
audience.

'Dawn O'Porter has a follower being sponsored not to get lost
on the M25 (not quite sure how that works, but she's raised £65 so 
far).

Some of the tweets for #twittermillion

'Lauren Laverne is being sponsored to cook for her husband - she 
last did it in 2004 and he has begged her to reconsider, but she's doing
it for Comic Relief so he will just have to suffer.

'One of my team is 
having a drinking competition during our TV show on Friday - where she 
drinks a shot every time a track by Coldplay comes on... she's going to
be legless, and we'll make a fortune.

'We have sponsored silences, 
sponsored pregnancies, cake sales, jewellery sales, massage sales, 
oddjob sales - and today a man joined a #twittermillion team saying that since he is severely disabled and the only thing he could do would be togive up 
swearing... so he's doing that!

'The competition between the team 
captains, the extravagance of the bribes for team members, and the 
brilliance of the feats being undertaken to raise money have all taken
my breath away.

'I have no more breath now, it's all gone, and we 
have raised thousands! No figures yet as we don't want to 
demoralise Peter Serafinowicz (who has raised £20 and has two team 
members), but these tweeters have become alchemists and turned twitter 
into gold. And Comic Relief are the lucky beneficiaries.'
