Very few people have lived to tell the tale of what it is like to be inside a tornado – and you can’t rely on Frank Baum's Wizard of Oz.

But now a video has emerged taken from inside a car, which survived a tornado passing over it.

The dashboard-mounted device recorded the incredible transformation of the weather from persistent rain to a terrifying cyclone of wind uprooting trees and whipping debris through the air.

It was left switched on by its owner who was not in the car.

The footage was filmed in Bashkiria, Russia last year, but was released this week on Reddit. 

The video shows the weather changing from calm to chaos in under a minute, starting with raindrops rolling down the car’s windscreen, with the sky a foreboding grey and descending into large pieces of wood being flung through the air and the car’s previously clean glass covered in pieces of debris.

A tornado is a narrow, rapidly spinning column of air around an intense low pressure centre that reaches the ground from cumulonimbus clouds, also known as thunderstorm clouds, according to the MET Office.

Tornadoes have a narrow width, usually up to 100m but the damage can be concentrated and severe.

As they develop, funnel shaped clouds extend from the base of the cloud and when these reach the ground, a tornado is formed.

Tornadoes can have wind speeds up to 300mph, and when they touch the ground can destroy trees and buildings in their path, throwing heavy objects like cars though the air like a Frisbee. 

Tornadoes which occur over water are referred to as a waterspout and those which do not touch ground are referred to as a funnel cloud.

The highest surface wind speed ever recorded of 302mph is a result of the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak.

The greatest distance travelled by a single tornado was 219 miles (352km) from Ellington, Missouri to Princeton, Indiana, on 18 March 1925. 

The most tornadoes in a single year were recorded in 2004. There were 1,820. 

Incredibly, despite trailers and trees nearby being thrown around and uprooted, the car remains intact and on the ground, indicating perhaps it was in the eye of the storm, which if so, was not as calm as many might imagine.

It has not yet been confirmed by Russia's meteorological services whether the footage really does capture a video from the centre of a tornado.

Dr Catherine Muller told MailOnline that it is very hard to tell and that there are few specifics available.

'We can’t be sure of the exposure of the car – it appears to be surrounded by buildings which will give it some protection,' she said.

'The type of car will also have had an impact – a solid 4x4 is less likely to be lifted compared to a small car.'  

A spokesman for the US' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said that the car could actually be places on the near edge of the tornado.

This is because, 'early on, everything is moving away from the camera and there's very little that comes towards the camera at the end.'

'Even if it had had a direct passage by the middle of the tornado where, in some cases, the winds might be weaker, you've have had all the strong winds on either side of the tornado go by.'

Based on how the wood flies through the air, he thinks that the tornado may have reached speeds of up to 113mph (217kph). 

Eyewitness accounts from people who claim to have been inside a tornado are rare, but seem to support the theory that the eye of the storm is eerily calm.

Will Keller, a farmer from Kansas claims to have been in the eye of a storm in 1928 and said that once he was inside a tornado, everything was ‘as still as death,’ How Stuff Works reported. 

He said there was a strong gassy smell, which made it hard to breathe and looked up to see the circular shape of the tornado around him.

Another farmer called Roy Hall found himself inside a tornado in Texas in 1951.

He ran inside his house when hail stones that size of tennis balls began raining down. He then reportedly heard a low rumbling and then silence.

The roof of his house was ripped off and he was surrounded by a wall of clouds illumined blue from lightning, he said.

The footage was filmed in Bashkiria, Russia (marked on the map) last year, but was released this week

The American Meteorological Society defines a tornado, known as a twister, ‘a violent rotating column of air, in contact with the ground, either pendant from a cumuliform cloud or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a funnel cloud. A stock image is pictured
