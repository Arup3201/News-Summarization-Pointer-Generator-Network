Chinese internet were barred from searching ‘the truth’ on its loading social media website, has been revealed.

Attempts to search for the phrase were blocked on the Twitter-like site Weibo.com, which boasts 300million users.

Users noticed on Thursday that if they typed in the Chinese characters for ‘the truth’, they received a message refusing to display any results.

Censored: Weibo.com, China's most popular micro-blogging site with 300million accounts, barred users from searching for the phrase 'the truth'

It read: ‘According to relevant laws, regulations and policies, search results for 'the truth' cannot be displayed.’

It is not known how long the phrase search was blocked and if China’s controlling Communist government intervened.

A spokesman for the website insisted that the block was due to a ‘technical glitch’.

However, the one-party state is notorious for actively blocking sites such as Facebook and Twitter with the so-called Great Firewall of China.

Under Chinese law, social media firms are also required to self-censor.

At the same time that ‘the truth’ was inaccessible, the Weibo account of the U.S. Consulate in Shanghai was also inaccessible.

A search for the account said results could not be displayed and ‘relevant sensitive information or garbage content has been filtered’.

Consulate officials said they did not know why their account, which sometimes comments on sensitive social issues, could not be reached.

Qi Zhenyu, head of social media for iSun Affairs, a Hong Kong-based current affairs online magazine that is banned in China, said of Weibo: ‘It is not unusual but it is quite ironic this time – you can't simply block the truth.’

Burgeoning interest: Chinese internet use is expanding rapidly with sales of gadgets, including iPads (above) soaring. But the Government is fearful that it could lead to a potential revolt by its people

In the past, blocked terms have included ‘Tiananmen Square’ and ‘Bo Xilai’, the disgraced politician whose wife was suspected of murdering British businessman Neil Heywood.

‘Weibo is the most popular social media site in China and as a result suffers the highest level of censorship,’ Mr Qi told the Daily Telegraph.

‘Whenever there is a word that upsets them, they just go ahead and block [but] most of the time you can't really explain why they censor a certain word.’

It is possible that Beijing's sensitivity to internet freedom may have increased in recent days after news that the Chinese economy is growing at its slowest rate since the global recession began in 2008.

They fear that the clamour for democracy could grow if people cannot see concrete economic benefits to strict control by a single political party.

One of Beijing's biggest battles in its bid to control the web – and avoid descent against the regime – has been with Google.

The internet giant last year axed its Chinese search engine and closed down its office in the country after becoming frustrated by censorship.

Users on the mainland can still access Google searches in Hong Kong – but China censors the results.

However, last month the California-based firm ruffled feathers of Beijing’s party bosses by adding  a feature that suggests alternatives for search terms that might result in blocked results.
