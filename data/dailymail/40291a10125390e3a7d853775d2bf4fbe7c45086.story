Jailed: Former have-a-go hero Jacikas was convicted of murder in just one hour

A have-a-go hero who tackled a gun-wielding robber has been jailed for life for a brutal murder.

Deivydas Jacikas, 21, was praised for his bravery after he was caught on camera stopping a fleeing jewel thief last February.

But just eight months later Lithuanian immigrant Jacikas carried out a revenge attack on a grandfather-of-nine Henrikas Baranauskas, 56, who he claimed head-butted his father.

Jacikas confronted father-of-eight Mr Baranauskas last October before beating him so savagely his victim sustained 14 fractured ribs and severe brain damage.

Mr Baranauskas was so badly beaten that his family eventually had to make the agonising decision to switch off his life support machine.

The attack of 'extreme violence' by Jacikas was in stark contrast to the scene in Peterborough city centre eight months previously, when the Lithuanian had risked his life tackling armed jewellery store raiders.

The factory worker made national headlines after dramatic images showed him wrestling with a gun-toting robber, who eventually dropped his weapon and fled the scene.

During the murder trial, prosecutors had made reference to the jewellery store robbery after which Jacikas was hailed a hero.

Angela Rafferty, prosecuting, said: 'At the time you said you were told you might get a medal for what you had done.

'You said you felt like a hero because so many people told you that you were a hero.

'On October 1 did you feel like a hero?'

Bravery: The Lithuanian was praised for 'trying to do the right thing' when he tackled the gun-toting raider

Jacikas simply replied: 'No'.

After the dramatic incident last February, Jacikas had modestly told how he was just an 'ordinary man trying to do the right thing'.

He told at the time how he thought 'I am dead' as he confronted the gunman before describing how residents in Cambridgeshire called him the 'hero of Peterborough'.

Killing: A court heard former hero Jacikas used 'extreme violence and showed no mercy' during the attack last October

Speaking after the jewellery heist, he said: 'I have never acted so bravely before, I've never seen a gun, or caught a shoplifter, or anything like that. This is a first for me and it was very scary. 

'But I would do the same again, of course.'

Jacikas told the court during his murder trial he had been ‘very angry’ when he was told by his mother Mr Baranauskas had head-butted his father, and had gone to his home for ‘revenge’.

He also admitted he had washed his trainers the following day as he feared there was blood on them - but he denied stamping or kicking Mr Baranauskas.

After Jacikas received a life sentence for murder at Cambridge Crown Court, Detective Chief Inspector George Barr said the Lithuanian used 'extreme violence and showed no mercy'.

He said: 'This was a sustained and brutal beating carried out by Jacikas after it was alleged the victim had assaulted his father.

'Jacikas showed Mr Baranauskas no mercy and continued to punch, kick and stamp on him even after he had been knocked unconscious.

'He is clearly a dangerous individual who is prepared to use extreme violence and we are glad he has been brought to justice.

'I
hope Mr Baranauskas’ family will be able to take some comfort from the 
decision of the court and are able to move on with their lives.'

Pathologist
Dr Benjamin Swift said Mr Baranauskas would have spent the rest of his 
life being fed through a tube if he had survived the beating at the 
hands of Jacikas.

Jacikas, 
from Millfield, Peterborough, who admitted manslaughter but denied 
murder, was convicted by a jury in just over an hour yesterday following
a week-long trial at Cambridge Crown Court.
