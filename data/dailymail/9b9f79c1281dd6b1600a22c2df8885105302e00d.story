Women are failing to exercise for fear of being judged over their appearance and ability at the gym, a new study has found.

Across the UK two million fewer women than men take part in sport and regularly exercise.

And a new piece of research conducted by Sport England has identified three core factors holding them back.

They found concerns over appearance, ability and whether they will, as mothers, be judged for putting themselves first, deter women from living healthier lifestyles.

The study has prompted a new campaign to empower women, encouraging more to get active and improve their health.

A new study by Sport England found 75 per cent of women would like to exercise but don't because they fear they will be judged 

Of the 9.4million women aged 14 to 40 that Sport England are targeted as part of the This Girl Can campaign, 7.1million - 75 per cent - would like to exercise more. 

Set to launch in January, the campaign will encourage women to join local sports clubs, gyms, and exercise at home.

The study found the fear of judgement is greater than women's self-confidence. 

Jennie Price, chief executive of Sport England, said: 'Women do less sport and exercise than men, but most say they would like to do more.

'So we had to get to the bottom of what's holding them back.

'We found out by talking to women of all ages up and down the country that what's stopping them is fear, fear of judgement: whether that's about how they look, whether they're any good at it, or feeling guilty about spending time on themselves.

'Whichever way you slice it, women's fear of judgement is sapping their confidence.

'This Girl Can is a celebration of all the women who are finding the confidence to exercise: it's an attitude, and a call to action for all women to do the same.' 

While identifying a host of reasons holding women back from exercising, the unifying factor was a fear of being judged.

They found concerns over appearance, ability and whether they will, as mothers, be judged for putting themselves first, deter women from living healthier lifestyles

The research has prompted a new campaign This Girl Can, which will launch in the new year and aims to encourage women to join sports clubs, gyms and exercise at home

Women who were interviewed knew they should exercise, and expressed a wish to take part in sport but despite that they did not achieve the recommended levels of exercise.

The study uncovered a fear among mothers of being judged for spending too much time on themselves.

Worrying that others will deem they are putting themselves first appeared as a major barrier to exercise for those with children.

And among other women of all ages, concerns over how they look while exercising was enough to stop them taking part in sport and exercise.

The third major barrier was a fear over ability, whether they were good enough, too good and therefore unfeminine, stopping them. 

The This Girl Can campaign aims to address womens' fears, by helping to show women are not alone in their fears.

Sport England said it is hoped the campaign will inspire a 'moment of realisation' in women when 'they recognise that they are not alone', building confidence.
