Michael Oliver is an excellent referee but still inexperienced at the very top level dealing with world-class players — and he met one at Turf Moor in Diego Costa.

The Chelsea forward was sharp to intercept a backpass and knock the ball past Tom Heaton in the Burnley goal. 

Oliver was understandably caught a distance from play and either guessed or was advised by his assistant that Costa had dived, so he awarded a defensive free-kick and cautioned Costa for simulation. Replays showed that Costa had been fouled and Chelsea should have been awarded a penalty.
