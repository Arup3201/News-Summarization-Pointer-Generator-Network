Jose Mourinho insists that he has no plans to bolster his Chelsea squad during the forthcoming transfer window.

With the Blues three points clear are the top of the Premier League and still fighting for four competitions, Mourinho is hoping to keep his 'very, very good' squad together.

When asked if he would be making any January deals, the Chelsea manager told talkSPORT: 'No. We have a short squad but we’ve got good players, some younger, some older, but the squad is very, very good.

'Our project is to start and finish the season with the same group of players, so there will be nobody to leave and nobody to come in either.'

Mourinho was speaking after Chelsea secured a place in the Capital One Cup semi-finals with a 3-1 win against Derby on Tuesday night,

After an opening goal from Eden Hazard, youngster Kurt Zouma was taken off on a stretcher following a nasty clash of heads with Petr Cech.

Zouma, who was reportedly feeling better shortly after his substitution, looks set to be available for Chelsea's trip to Stoke on Monday night.

Mourinho added: 'When John Terry signalled that we needed to change I thought we might be in trouble, but no, happily for us and for the kid, we weren’t.

'He’s fine, he took a punch from Petr and had a cut inside his mouth, so taking him off was just a precaution. He was fine in the dressing room after.'
