Thirteen suspected illegal immigrants from Ethiopia were spotted running from the back of a lorry on a busy motorway today.

Rush-hour traffic had to be slowed between junctions 12 and 13 of the M25 in Surrey as police dealt with the incident this morning, although officers arrived after the lorry had driven from the scene.

However the 13 men and women were found walking along the motorway and were arrested on suspicion of immigration offences. They are now being held in custody by Surrey Police.

Those detained are believed to be from
 Ethiopia, although their ages are not yet known. It was the latest 
incident involving suspected illegal immigrants being found in the backs
 of lorries on UK soil.

The arrests came three days after a man was detained for alleged ‘facilitation offences’ after 24 Eritrean nationals were discovered in the rear of an HGV in Whitfield, near Dover, Kent.

Paramedics from South East Coast Ambulance Service checked them over at the scene but none needed hospital treatment.

Across
 the English Channel, there has been heightened tension over the number 
of migrants using Calais as a staging post to try to reach the UK.

Hundreds of migrants, mainly from Africa, are camping or living in squats there, which has led to clashes on the streets in northern France.

'Police received a number of calls around 8.50am from members of the public reporting that they had seen a large group of people getting out of the back of a lorry'
