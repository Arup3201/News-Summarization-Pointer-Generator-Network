The ticket to Europe may say nonstop, but the flight may not be, thanks in part to a supercharged Jetstream across the Atlantic.

Carriers like Continental Airlines have been making unscheduled pit stops as they fly west - in fact, every 43 out of 1,100 flights were diverted in December in Boeing 757 aircrafts, reports say. A year ago, that number was only 12. 

But weather patterns aren’t the only culprit - the airline has been using the smaller jet to fly to and from Europe in an attempt to cut costs.

Fighting the headwinds: Continental has made unannounced landings in four per cent of its December flights in order to refuel

United Continental Holdings – which operates both United and Continental after their 2010 merger – said the headwinds this December have been incredibly strong, in part due to La Niña.

The winds typically averaged 28 mph ten years ago, but are now nearly double that, the strongest it’s been in ten years.

But the unscheduled landings are tied up in the company’s enthusiastic use of the smaller, single-aisle 757 rather than larger models, which take up more fuel but also have bigger tanks and range.

Smaller planes also mean fewer flight attendants. But the result is toying with the plane’s limits, the Wall Street Journal reports.

Boeing 757s have a nautical range of around 4,000 miles, which pushes the boundary on most transcontinental flights, especially when strong headwinds eat up more of the plane’s fuel reserves.

Pilots have made landings in Canada, Nova Scotia, Ireland, Iceland, and elsewhere to refuel their aircraft, a safer bet than eating into fuel reserves.

By law, pilots must have enough fuel to fly the plane for an additional 45 minutes past its planned destination.

Waiting game: Refueling the 757s means longer wait times and possibly missing connecting flights

The remote Goose Bay and Gander airports in Canada remain the most popular refuelling locations. While refilling the aircraft typically takes 45 minutes to an hour to complete, it can cost those on tight travelling schedules days after missed connections.

A typical nonstop flight from London to 
Newark, New Jersey now takes around eight and a half hours, as opposed 
to seven hours in the opposite direction.

While there’s little to be done about unpredictable weather patterns, travellers can use several tricks to better their chances a flight won’t make an unannounced pit stop.

The best way is by checking the plane model. Airlines often show seat maps during ticket purchasing. This often reveals if the aircraft used will be a 757 (with one aisle) or a larger carrier with two aisles.

The Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday in a statement that it is ‘aware that United Airlines aircraft have made more unscheduled fuel stops this year than last year and we are looking into the issue.’

While the choice makes more business sense to an industry that has witnessed very real and severe financial changes and skyrocketing fuel prices, it has been nothing but a headache to the thousands of travellers forced to make other plans as their nonstop flights have been delayed by hours at a time.

A spokesman for the company said that when the situation warrants it, passengers are compensated for the inconvenience.

Using smaller aircraft works when the weather is docile, but this particular weather pattern is unpredictable, making the use of 757s for nonstop flights a gamble.

Meteorologists are unsure how long this one will last.

United/Continental spokesperson Megan McCarthy said that the headwinds have been a ‘once in ten year extreme.’

She told ABC News: ‘We are looking at it very closely, it is an inconvenience to our customers, to determine if there are other options.’

The strong winds work in favour of travellers heading east, however.

According to CNNMoney, U.S.-bound flights are saving money because of the added boost of the winds.

Because of the unseasonably mild winter, airlines have been saving money that would have been otherwise spent ploughing, salting, and de-frosting.

In addition, smaller airports can bring in ‘tens of thousands of dollars’ in landing fees and other profits.

Other airlines have also been affected by the headwinds. American Airlines and US Airways both fly 757s to Europe but have had only a few diversions due to the strong winds.

Delta, according to the Wall Street Journal, had none.

A flight to Stuttgart, Germany from Newark, New Jersey is around 4,540 miles, though according to Boeing’s website, the 757 has a maximum range of around 4,450 nautical miles.

Skyrocketing costs: Rising fuel prices have left the airline with few options - without headwinds, the flight can be done easily with a 757

A spokeswoman said that several modifications to the model have allowed for better fuel efficiency.

On a very short list of options, Continental has discussed the use of extra tanks on its 757 models, sources told the Journal.

In 2005, the airline company swapped out many of its older features that were prime culprits in guzzling fuel.

La Niña brings cooler than normal ocean temperatures across the Pacific and wetter than normal conditions in the northwest. Its outcomes most often manifest during the winter months.

According to Nasa, trade winds are unusually strong during the weather pattern due to a contrast in pressure.

Winglets were added to allow 200 additional miles of flying. Steel brakes were replaced with carbon ones, that cut the weight of the aircraft by 600 pounds.

In addition, several coach-class seats were removed, bringing the total number to 169, allowing for slightly less luggage and more legroom, a spokesperson said.

Retired Continental executive Gordon Bethune told the Journal that installing more fuel tanks is ‘not economical’ and ‘fairly complicated.’

USAirways still uses 777 and 767 jets, which travel longer distances without the need to refuel.

Other larger models are used on different routes.
