A judge has granted media organizations' request for a hearing to discuss access to transcripts and court documents related to top secret proceedings in the Chandra Levy case.

Judge Gerald Fisher scheduled a hearing for tomorrow on the issue brought by the media groups, including the Associated Press.

He has held two recent hearings in the case and barred the public and press from hearing the majority of both proceedings, which took place after possible doubts of the key witness emerged.

The man convicted of killing Levy may go free after doubts have surfaced over the credibility of a key witness.

Fisher added that he has sealed a portion of the first hearing because of 'safety issues.'

The media also want to attend another hearing scheduled for Thursday and future hearings.

A Salvadoran man, Ingmar Guandique, was convicted of killing Levy in 2010. He is serving a 60-year prison sentence.

It was reported last month that Guandique, 31, may have his conviction tossed out after doubts emerged over the credibility of a key witnesses' testimony.

The disclosure led the judge to hold the secret hearings with prosecutors and lawyers for Guandique to discuss the case.

Court records show the hearings have 
taken place behind closed doors but neither prosecutors nor defense 
lawyers have revealed the purpose of the sessions.

Guandique always maintained his innocence in Levy's death.

Even Levy's devastated parents are being kept in the dark over what was going on.

'Whether they have to have a new trial or have another suspect, or whatever, we don't know,' her dad, Robert Levy, told CBS News.

'They can't tell us because it's secret.'

Chandra, whose case captured the nation's attention because of her affair with her married boss, California congressman Gary Condit.

Though Condit, who is no longer in Congress, was interviewed by 
investigators, authorities eventually ruled him out as a suspect and 
don't believe he had anything to do with her death. 

Condit testified at trial that he had 
no role in Levy's disappearance or death, but evaded questions about his
relationship with her.

Guandique, an illegal immigrant
from El Salvador, was convicted in 2010 of killing Levy, but always maintained his innocence. 

Levy's remains  
were found in 2002 in a heavily wooded area of Washington's Rock Creek 
Park.

Guandique's lawyers are accusing prosecutors of withholding evidence.

Prosecutors acknowledged at the outset of the case that they had no physical evidence linking Guandique to Levy's death, but they argued at trial that the attack on Levy fit a pattern of attacks by Guandique on other female joggers in Rock Creek park around the same time she went missing.

Their case also leaned heavily on the testimony of a former cellmate of Guandique, who claimed that Guandique admitted while behind bars to killing Levy.

Guandique is currently serving a 60-year prison sentence.

Robert Levy said, 'He's a convicted rapist and an illegal alien. He's not legal at all or 
working or anything. He's just a criminal, so he shouldn't go free.

'But 
if he's innocent of murder then he shouldn't be in jail for it.'
