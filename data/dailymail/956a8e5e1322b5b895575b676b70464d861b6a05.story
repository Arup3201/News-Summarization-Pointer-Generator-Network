When asking Hollywood celebrities what they love about England you'd think they'd say the history, the buildings - or most likely, accent. So this latest revelation from Gwyneth Paltrow may come as quite a shock.

Despite having a bank balance healthier than most, the 39-year old actress has revealed her love of Boots the Chemist.

In a recent interview the mother-of-two said: 'One of the many exciting things about living in England for a good part of the year is the perpetual discovery.

'Boots is almost as ubiquitous as the pub here in England. Everyone raves about Boots' own line No7 and their range of high quality cosmetics, moisturisers and cleansers.'

The high street chain became popular with Brits following the discovery by scientists from BBC's Horizons programme that the No7 Perfect and Protect cream was a 'miracle product'.

Shoppers queued for hours to test it out and stores had to ration purchases after many sold out in minutes.

But Gwyneth isn't the only A-lister to admit to being a fan of the popular chemist. Even royalty shop there.

The Duchess of Cambridge, 30, is often spotted at her local branch buying Nivea Visage Pure and Natural Moisturising Day crea, which costs just £5.10.

And with so many skincare products costing upwards of £100, it's refreshing to see that celebrities appreciate bargain buys too.

Jennifer Aniston, 43, may be one of the world's most beautiful - and wealthiest - women but she swears by a £1.99 bar of soap. In an interview she revealed: 'I've been using it since High School.

'I wake up and wash my face with Neutrogena face soap. I use a serum and then a Dr Hauschka day cream - that’s it!'

Even Victoria's Secret model Miranda Kerr doesn't break the bank with an expensive beauty routine.

The 28-year old Australian model says her blemish-free skin and glossy hair is down to a £8.25 pot of coconut oil.

‘I will not go a day without coconut 
oil. I personally take four tablespoons per day, either on my salads, in
my cooking or in my cups of green tea,' the model explained.

But for Golden Globe nominee Emma Stone, 23, her sensitive skin may limit the choice but a £3.49 bottle of grapeseed oil works wonders.

Speaking earlier this year the actress revealed: 'I'm seriously allergic to everything. So I just use natural grapeseed oil from the grocery store on my face as a moisturiser. After the shower, I pat it on, and then I'll use it throughout the day and night.'

For some stars though creativity can be just as worthwhile as splashing the cash. And in a shock twist the celebrity who swears by this technique is Victoria Beckham.

The Spice Girl turned designer has reportedly been experimenting with making her own facemasks with her latest creation being her best yet.

A friend of the 37-year old told Heat magazine that blending apricot and avocado is her 'latest thing'. The concoction is supposed to have anti-ageing properties when applied to the skin and has even been described as the 'million-dollar facial'.
