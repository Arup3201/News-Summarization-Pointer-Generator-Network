The remains of one of the oldest homes in Britain, built more than 10,000 years ago, 
have been unearthed near Edinburgh.

The dwelling was found in the path of the new Forth bridge and has been dated to around 8240 BC.

A large oval pit measuring nearly seven metres and studded with post holes was all that remained standing of the home from the Mesolithic period.

Remains of several fireplace hearths were discovered at the site. This illustration shows how it may have looked like

The holes would have held wooden posts supporting the walls and roof, which experts believe would 
have been covered with turf. Remains of several fireplace hearts were also discovered.

The ancient people who lived in the area were hunter gatherers and charred bone fragments on the site suggest they ate birds, fish, wild boar and possible deer.  Large quantities of charred hazelnut shells were also found. The residents were among the first settlers in Scotland after the last glacial period (a time within an ice age marked by colder temperatures).

Archaeologists also recovered more than 1,000 flint artefacts including stone tools that would have been used for tasks including hunting, skinning and food processing.

Ed Bailey, Project Manager for Headland Archaeology, the company that carried out the works, said: 

'The discovery of this previously 
unknown, and rare type of site has provided us with a unique opportunity
 to further develop our understanding of how early prehistoric people 
lived along the Forth.

'Specialist analysis of archaeological and 
palaeoenvironmental evidence recovered in the field is ongoing. This 
will allow us to put the pieces together and build a detailed picture of
 Mesolithic lifestyle.'

The archaeology team also found the 
toe bones - most likely from a wolf - within the house. It's not known 
if this came from a wolf pelt that would have been worn or used to line 
the floor for warmth.

The Mesolithic people were hunter gatherers, anatomically indistinguishable from modern humans, who would have subsisted on a diet of wild foodstuffs.

They were among the first settlers in Scotland after the last glacial period (a time within an ice age marked by colder temperatures).

Archaeologists have evidence from the Forth bridge site that they may have eaten birds, fish, wild boar and possibly red or roe deer.

As well as for their meat animals would also been hunted for their hides, sinew, bones, fat and other by-products.

It is not possible to say if the house was a community hub but there was definitely no cattle or other domesticated animal present.

Animal domestication does not begin until the Neolithic, over 4,000 years after the date of the Mesolithic House.

The
 team believe the house was a semi-permanent structure not occupied all 
year round, but possibly for seasonal use in this case over the colder 
winter months. It would most likely have belonged to a family grouping, 
probably including extended members.

They said they weren't surprised to find no evidence of domesticated animals, as this did not begin until the Neolithic period, over 4,000 years after the date of the house.

Historic Scotland Senior Archaeologist, Rod McCullagh, said: 'This discovery and, especially, the information from the laboratory analyses adds valuable information to our understanding of a small but growing list of buildings erected by Scotland’s first settlers after the last glaciation, 10,000 year ago.

'The radiocarbon dates that have been taken from this site show it to be the oldest of its type found in Scotland which adds to its significance.'

Transport Minister Keith Brown said: 'This ancient dwelling, which was unearthed as part of the routine investigations undertaken prior to construction works, is an important and exciting discovery.

'We now have vital records of the findings which we will be able to share to help inform our understanding of a period in Scotland's ancient history.'

All of the artefacts will be preserved.
