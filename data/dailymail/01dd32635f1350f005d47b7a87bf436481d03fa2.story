A dramatic video today revealed the frightening moment a kayaker was saved from drowning when he became trapped between two rocks.

Mark Hardingham, 56, of Bristol, was paddling down the River Lyn in Devon on Saturday when he became ‘vertically pinned', with his body trapped and his head held underwater by the current.

But the video, posted online by extreme sports channel EpicTV, shows how he was pulled out by friends James Bradley, Pete Henderon, Carl Ross, Mark Shackleton, Justin Gale and Simon Morse.

Stranded: Mark Hardingham, 56, of Bristol, had been paddling down the River Lyn in Devon on Saturday

Stuck: He became 'vertically pinned', with his body trapped and his head held underwater by the current

After a tense few moments, the men 
managed to pull him up and out of the water with the help of a rope and 
carabiner, before he climbed up onto a rock and told them he was okay.

Mr
Hardingham said in the video: ‘I got caught under that rock. If you get
caught there you go round and round, and I lost my speed and landed up 
on that rock.’

The 
caption for the video on EpicTV said: 'It's a great reminder for us all 
of the unpredictable nature of whitewater and the importance of always 
paddling with good friends and carrying safety gear.’

Natty Cordon, of Bath, Somerset, wrote
on the TV channel's Facebook page: 'Exactly the same thing happened to me 
here the day before. This spot must be treated with respect.'

Relief: Mr Hardingham said in the video that he had became caught under a rock after losing his speed

Other commentators praised the men for a 'very hell handled' situation and a 'nice, quick rescue'.

The
upper and gorge sections of the East Lyn River are regularly used by 
kayakers, and the route is listed as one of the most difficult 
rivers to kayak in England.

Mr
Hardingham often posts on the Facebook page of the South Avon Canoe 
Club about his trips down various rivers in Britain and also recently 
told about a kayaking trip he made to Norway.
