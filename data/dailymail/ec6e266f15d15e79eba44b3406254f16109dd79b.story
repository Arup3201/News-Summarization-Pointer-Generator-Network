A new strain of stomach bug was responsible for sickening nearly 700 people on a luxury cruise ship, it has been revealed.

The Royal Caribbean's Explorer of the Seas was forced to dock in New Jersey last week after 630 passengers and 54 crew members fell violently ill.

Now, scientists have discovered a new Sydney strain of norovirus was to blame for the outbreak.

Outbreak: A new strain of norovirus was responsible for sickening nearly 700 people on the Royal Caribbean's Explorer of the Seas (pictured). The luxury cruise ship was forced to dock in Bayonne, New Jersey, last week

Arrival: 630 passengers and 54 crew members fell violently ill on the ship. Above, guests wave as it docks

Nearly home: Four passengers depart from the Cape Liberty Cruise Port at Bayonne last Wednesday

Contagious: Scientists have discovered a new Sydney strain of norovirus was to blame for the outbreak. Above, a microscopic view of norovirus, which can be picked up from infected people, food, water or surfaces

The discovery - made by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention - means the incident was one the largest norovirus outbreaks on a cruise ship in the past 20 years.

The highly-contagious stomach bug, once 
known as Norwalk virus, can be picked up from 
an infected person, contaminated food or water or by touching 
contaminated surfaces.

The Sydney strain, which emerged within 
about the last two years, is not considered unusually dangerous.

However, it has quickly become a common cause of vomiting and diarrhea, with symptoms lasting several days.

Back to port: The Explorer of Seas, carrying 3,050 passengers, hit the headlines at the end of January

Luxurious: One passenger shouted, 'We made it!', as the ship docked after the 10-day cruise was cut short

In 2006, a norovirus outbreak on a Carnival Cruise Lines ship also sickened close 
to 700 people.

The Explorer 
of Seas, which was carrying 3,050 passengers, hit the headlines toward 
the end of January as hundreds of passengers and crew members fell 
victim to the stomach bug.

One
 woman aboard the ship shouted, 'We made it!', as it
 docked in Bayonne after the 10-day cruise was cut short.

Response: Health officials recommended that guests still showing symptoms checked in at hotels or sought medical care before heading home. Above, two passengers drag their luggage through the port in Bayonne

Compensation: Royal Caribbean provided all passengers with a 50 per cent refund of their cruise fares

Safe: Following the ship's docking, guests were also given an additional 50 percent future cruise credit

Other passengers, with blankets wrapped around them,
 stood on deck to watch the ship pull in.

Following the ship's docking, Royal 
Caribbean provided all guests with a 50 per cent refund of their cruise 
fares - with an additional 50 per cent future cruise credit.

Safe at harbour: After returning to port, the ship was sanitized and no one was allowed aboard for 24 hours

It also reimbursed airline change fees and accommodations for passengers who had to
 change plans for traveling home.

Meanwhile, stricken
 guests who were confined to their staterooms were provided a 
credit of one future cruise day for each day of confinement.

After
 returning to port, the ship was sanitized and no one was 
allowed aboard for a period of more than 24 hours as an extra 
precaution, the cruise line said.
