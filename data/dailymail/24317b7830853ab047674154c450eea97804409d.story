Folding bikes may not be new, but this latest model takes the idea a step further by not only adding an electric motor, but making it so small it can fit inside in a bag.

The Impossible bike travels at 12.5mph (20km/h) for 45 minutes on a single charge, and can carry the weight of a 13-stone (85kg) rider.

The designers have launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund production of the bike, and although they don’t reveal the exact dimensions or weight of the bike, a video shows it being placed easily in an average backpack.

The Impossible bike (pictured) from Beijing-based Impossible Technology supports riders of up to 13 stone (85kg). It travels at 12.5mph (20km/h) for 45 minutes using 10 2,900mAh batteries. The brakes are controlled using a button on the handlebars, and the wheels are hollow, but solid

Unfolding the carbon fibre bike is carried out in four stages.

It is unlocked, the saddle and handlebars twist into position, the whole bike is pulled up to the correct height, and then frame locks it all into place.

This height is adjustable and comes with four options - 2.1ft (65cm), 2.2ft (70cm), 2.4ft (75cm) and 2.6ft (80cm).

Impossible is powered by a DC brushless motor, custom-built by the Beijing-based design team, and it runs on 10 2,900mAh batteries.

An engineer who was told by cyclists that they never wore a helmet because they were 'an inconvenience to carry' recently came up with a solution - the folding helmet.

The Plixi helmet, neatly folds away to a third of its size in small bags.

It costs about £79 ($126) and was made by engineer Phillipe Arrouart, 40, from Paris.

The size of the helmet when folded is 8.3 x 4.3 x 6.3 inches (21 x 11 x 16 cm), and it weights just 1lb (490g).

Its outer shell is made of ABS plastic and the inner shell is made of expanded polystyrene. 

The prototype version travels at 12.5mph (20km/h) for 45 minutes on a single charge, and these batteries take around half an hour to recharge.

‘One of our main challenges was choosing an electric motor that would fit our parameters both in terms of power and in terms of weight,’ said Impossible Technology.

‘For the purposes of our proof of concept, we have modified an existing electric motor.

‘However, Impossible will be shipped with a motor completely designed by Impossible Technology.’

The bike doesn’t have pedals, which means if the battery runs out mid-ride there is no way to power the device.

The frame is built around circles, instead of a single horizontal girder.

This ‘helps to ensure that the bike spreads the weight equally across the frame’ and the designed said they put the seat and the handle bars at similar heights so that the front and rear wheels would bear the weight of the rider equally.

A white model (pictured) can be ordered for £241 ($430 CAD), a black model costs £258 ($480 CAD)

But, as the designers explained on their Kickstarter page: ‘The main point of our bike is that it is light and small enough to be folded into your backpack.

‘If we add pedals or any other chain structure it will take more space and make it heavier.‘

But, they said they are making extra batteries to act as a backup. 

Plus, because of the bike's short charging time, the rider should be able to ‘fold it into a backpack and walk to a coffee shop to recharge the battery.’

Designers have already raised more than £123,000 ($218,850 CAD) via the Kickstarter campaign - achieving almost four times its target amount.

A white model can be pre-ordered for £241 ($430 CAD), while a black model costs £258 ($480 CAD).

Once the campaign ends on 25 December, Impossible bikes will be shipped internationally by August 2015.
