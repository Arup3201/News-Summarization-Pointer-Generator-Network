Astonishing drawings of Adolf Hitler and his henchmen sketched in 1931 by a British artist who was allowed into the dictator's lair have emerged.

Helen McKie was the only woman allowed to sketch in Hitler's Munich headquarters, called Brown House, and she produced 17 chilling pictures of the Nazi monster and his inner-sanctum.

Drawn two years before Hitler came to power and eight years before the start of World War Two, the images are a glimpse into the early stages of Nazism.

Life-like: Astonishing drawings of Hitler and his henchmen sketched in the early days of the Nazi party by British artist Helen McKie have come to light

Inside the lair: Helen McKie was given access into the heart of the fledgling dictator's Munich headquarters two years before his bloody rise to power

The Brown House became the Nazi HQ on January 1, 1931 and it was named after the colour of the uniforms.

The drawings were put into an album and McKie wrote inside: 'Sketched in Hitler's Brown House Munich by special permission of Hitler's aide-de-camp Bruelenen - I was the only woman ever allowed to sketch here.'

The pencil sketches have emerged from the family of the late Mark Dineley, a well known arms and armour collector.

They have now been offered for sale at auction with an estimate of Â£7,000.

Incredible access: Helen McKie was the only woman allowed to sketch in Hitler's infamous Brown House lair and she produced 17 pictures detailing the day-to-day life of the Nazi party

Trouble: This drawing by the British artist shows police controlling a disturbance outside the Brown House

The captioned drawings show the entrance to the HQ, a Nazi saluting outside the council chamber and other interior scenes.

One shows Hitler standing rather effeminately, a pose which the artist copied from a portrait hanging in the council chamber.

Another of the captioned drawings shows 'three smiling Nazis with their beer tankards in the beer hall under the Brown House.'

She also depicted the interior of the room of the 'Committee of Control' with three Nazis in conversation.

Behind the scenes: This sketch shows two Nazis opening a curtain to a civilian

Glimpse into Nazism: This drawing by Helen McKie shows Nazi officials inside a committee room at Hitler's Munich headquarters

And there is also one showing two helmeted policemen outside the Brown House controlling a disturbance created by civilians.

As well as Hitler, Heinrich Himmler, Hermann Goring and Rudolf Hess had offices there and it was also home to the Nazi sacred relic, the 'blood flag'.

This was the swastika that was splattered with blood during the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch, when Munich police opened fire on the Nazis.

McKie, who was born in London in 1889 and died in 1957, was an illustrator in various magazines and became known for painting military figures in World War One.

Entrance: A guard stands in the reception hall of the Brown House

Evil: An inscription in the supreme council chamber. All of Helen McKie's images from inside the Brown House will be sold at auction on November 17

She lived and worked in Chelsea throughout her life, but travelled extensively with her work.

Her Nazi sketches are being sold at Dominic Winter auction house near Cirencester, Gloucester.

Chris Albury, from the saleroom, said: 'With the benefit of hindsight these drawings are quite chilling.

'They were drawn shortly before Hitler seized power and close to a turning point in German and world history.

'McKie is an interesting artist who gained a reputation during the First World War and she is well known as a transport artist.

'One of her paintings was presented to Churchill during World War Two and she was a good commercial artist.

'She managed to gain access to the Brown House and although these are only sketches there is a lot of movement and human quality.'

The Brown House was damaged in October 1943 and largely destroyed in an Allied bombing raid late in World War Two.

The rubble was cleared away in 1947, leaving an empty lot.

The auction takes place on November 17.
