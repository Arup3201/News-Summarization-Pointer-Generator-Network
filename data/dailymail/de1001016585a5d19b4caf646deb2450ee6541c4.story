'Monster': Alex Richter, 28, of Racine, Wisconsin is accused of molesting at least six young children and taping the assaults.

A college student is accused of molesting at least six young children and videotaping the assaults under such titles as 'Monster Unleashed.'

Alexander R. Richter, 28, who attended Gateway Technical College in Wisconsin, was jailed on 49 felony charges November 9.

Police believe there are more victims to be found.

Authorities say Richter volunteered to baby-sit his classmates' children and then repeatedly had sex with the boys and girls on camera as they cried and begged him to stop.

When detectives served Richter with a search warrant he told them, 'I'll save you time, the things you are looking for are under the coffee table,' the criminal complaint said.

Richter faces dozens of charges including first-degree sexual assault of a child under 13, sexual exploitation of a child and possession of child pornography.

Officers found an unspecified number of DVDs, a tripod, cameras and a hard drive in his house in Racine, Wisconsin.

They said one DVD, titled 'Monster Unleashed,' showed Richter having sex in his home with four different children -- three girls and a boy.

The youngest child, one of the girls, just turned 5 this month.

In some of the footage, the children are crying and can be heard telling Richter to stop or seen trying to fight him off, according to the complaint.

Police are looking to identify more victims.

Authorities have been able to name six children who appear in videos and photographs from evidence seized at Richter's house.

'We're not putting a number on it, but from the evidence we've recovered we believe there are additional victims,' Racine police Sgt. Marty Pavilonis said.

Accused child molester Alexander Richter, 28, offered to babysit for classmates at Gateway Technical College in Wisconsin.

Richter approached at least one classmate last year, according to the criminal complaint, and offered to baby-sit her children - a son who was then 6 years old and a daughter who had just turned 4.

He's accused of making at least 11 videos of himself having sex with both children, including one in which police say he guided the boy into attempted sexual activity with his sister.

Prosecutors said Richter also had photos of the siblings posing naked and simulating sex acts with each other.

The allegations came to light last month when the boy, now 7, touched another child inappropriately, the criminal complaint said.

When confronted, the boy told his mother that was how 'Alex' touches him and his sister, according to the complaint.

Investigators say the children told them Richter had oral and anal sex with them on multiple occasions, used sex toys on them and filmed them taking baths.

Pavilonis said authorities are trying to determine whether any of the images have been shared with other people as child pornography.

'A number of investigators and officers have children,' the police sergeant said, 'and we certainly investigate as if our own children were involved.'

Richter remains in jail after a judge set his bond at $1.5 million in cash.
