Switzerland will have a national referendum on immigration after an environmental group collected enough support to force it through.

The Ecopop group gathered 120,700 certified signatures which is well over the 100,000 required to bring about the nationwide poll.

They are concerned that natural resources are under pressure from overpopulation, in a country of eight million people of whom over a quarter are foreign.

Overpopulated: The environmental group want to limit immigration

Ecopop claim they are opposed to xenophobia and racism but say they need to limit the intake of new people to avoid urbanisation and help preserve agricultural land.

The Swiss People's Party, a right-wing group, have also collected enough signatures to force a refendum on toughening immigration quotas.

They believe immigration is to blame for rising rent costs and busie prublic transport systems.

The environmental group demand that annual population growth through immigration to be capped at 0.2% and a tenth of foreign aid money to be spent on birth control measures abroad.

Switzerland's population has risen over 15 per cent since 1990.

It was shown to be an attractive place to work in March with a low unemployment rate and comparatively high salaries.

Overcrowded: Immigration is to blame for public transport being busy, claim the Swiss People's Party

Former director of the Swiss environment department and current Ecopop member Philippe Roch told the BBC: 'The pressure on land, nature and the countryside is considerable, and quality of life is continuously deteriorating due to a lack of living space.'

Referenda can take place up to four times a year in Switzerland's system of direct democracy.

Switzerland's government has urged voters not to back the initiative because it would bring the country into conflict with its treaty obligations with the European Union.

Until last year Switzerland had a quota of 2,000 residency permits a year for citizens of the 'A8' nations, who joined the EU in 2004 - Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia.

Despite criticism from European Union officals the Swiss reinstated the immigration quota in April.
