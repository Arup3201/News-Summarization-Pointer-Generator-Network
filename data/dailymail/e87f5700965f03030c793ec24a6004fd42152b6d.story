Phil Mickelson, Rory McIlroy, Justin Rose, Luke Donald, Lee Westwood, Rickie Fowler and some of the world's best golfers took each other on in a flop shot challenge.

Filmed at the 2014 Scottish Open in Aberdeen, the European Tour challenged the stars to loop the ball over Phil Mickelson's head.

Cleared: Louis Oosthuizen clears Mickelson comfortably, but couldn't get into the top three nearest the pin

Agonising: Thomas Bjorn got closest to the pin after bouncing around the hole

Despite seeing players produce the flop over a living, breathing person for a challenge in the past, this time health and safety prevailed with a cardboard cutout of Lefty.

Mickelson had already been using his wedge regularly during the week, starting at the tournament hitting a backward flop shot, followed by a wedge shot off the path leading to a birdie.

There was no shortage of messing around, with Russell Know nearly taking the cardboard head clean off, Lee Westwood attempting to stick it through Mickelson's legs, and Miguel Angel Jimenez showing his football skills with a backheel over the cutout.

Thomas Bjorn (5cm) took the honours with nearest the pin, from Luke Donald (21cm) in second and Mickelson (39cm) himself in third.

Champion: Bjorn was the winner, from Luke Donald and Mickelson himself
