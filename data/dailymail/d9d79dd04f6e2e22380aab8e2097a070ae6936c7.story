Hamilton told media he would welcome a move for the F1 to 'sunny Sydney' if a proposed street circuit is approved by the NSW government. 

'Street circuits are the best. For a driver they're the best and it's best for people to get close to — some 300,000 to 400,000 people leaning out of apartment windows.' he told the Daily Telegraph.   

The 30-year-old Mercedes driver  recently featured on the cover of the US  Man of the World magazine
