North Korea has a new communist heir after the wife of dynastic dictator Kim Jong Un secretly gave birth late last year, it was claimed today.

The newborn, whose gender is not known, could become the fourth-generation to lead the communist dictatorship, but Pyongyang watchers believe the baby is most likely a girl.

'If it was a boy, [the North Koreans] would have made an announcement,' Michael Madden, editor of the online newsletter North Korea Leadership Watch, told the Washington Free Beacon.

Stepping into the limelight: Kim Jung Un's wife Ri Sol-Ju is being seen more often in public, fuelling claims that she has given birth

The birth is seen as significant 
because the communist regime in Pyongyang has evolved from a 
Soviet-installed Marxist-Leninist regime in the 1950s to an Asian family
 dynasty.

The newsletter said: 'South Korea’s government recently confirmed that Ri Sol-ju, Kim’s wife who was shown in recent months wearing designer fashions and expensive jewelry, had a child in late 2012.'

Kim
 Jong Un, who last week spent time with former NBA star Dennis Rodman, 
has dramatically increased the provocation his father was known for, 
with multiple tests of nuclear weapons and missiles.

Yet
 Rodman, who went to North Korea with the Harlem Globetrotters and an 
HBO camera crew, described the dictator as 'awesome' and lavished 
praised on him.

Speculation has been growing that the wife 
of North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-Un has given birth since she was pictured looking significantly slimmer at the end of 2012.

Photographs seen on North Korean TV 
show Ri Sol-Ju wearing a neatly-fitting two-piece skirt suit in contrast
 to the loose-fitting clothing she was seen wearing in mid December and 
which suggested she was heavily pregnant.

Before-and-after photos were run on 
South Korean TV and in Seoul newspapers today resulting in widespread 
agreement that Kim Jong-Un’s wife has had a child.

‘The bulging stomach has gone down – has Ri Sol-Ju given birth?’ asked one newspaper, the Dong-A Ilbo.

The
 caption in another South Korean paper, the Chosun Ilbo, read: ‘Ri 
Sol-Ju with her tummy reduced in 11 days. Has she come out right after 
childbirth?’

The photographs have undergone the most intense scrutiny and the verdict is that Ri Sol-Ju is a mother.

A South Korean government official, 
quoted by the national Yonhap news agency concluded that Ri ‘appeared to
 have already given birth based on analysis of the TV images.’

Defectors from North Korea are also said to have provided new details of Ri, who is considered a future power player in the Pyongyang leadership hierarchy and a growing influence on Kim Jong-un.

'Ri Sol-ju is a fresh face who is clearly stepping out but it’s much too early to say if her public activity will have any political relevance in North Korea,' said a U.S. official who did not answer questions about the birth.

Whether North Korea will officially announce what would be the equivalent of a royal birth is open to speculation.

No official announcement was made that Kim Jong Un even had a wife until state media eventually revealed it.

Kim Jong-Un was 
elevated to leader of the secretive Stalinist state following the death 
of his father, Kim Jong-Il, who had succeeded his own father, ‘Great 
Leader’ Kim Il-Sung.

According
 to South Korean media, citing intelligence reports, the couple were 
married in 2009 and already have one child.

But that has never been 
confirmed.

Birth: Speculation is growing that the wife of North Korea's leader Kim Jong-Un, left, has given birth in recent weeks, continuing the family dynasty into a fourth generation. Ri Sol-Ju is pictured right with her husband earlier this year

Ri is said to 
have come from an ‘ordinary family’ – although her father being an 
academic and her mother a doctor raises them above the average level.

The young wife of North Korea’s leader made her first public appearance in two months in October -  bringing to an end 
what might have been a period of ‘home detention’ for being too 
carefree.

Ri Sol-ju had been
 photographed earlier this year smiling and strolling about in a casual 
manner when accompanying her husband.

But
 then she disappeared from view, provoking speculation that she might be
 pregnant but more likely because she was not presenting the dour image 
promoted by her husband’s late father, Kim Jong-il.

Analysts say that despite the young 
Kim’s appointment as supreme commander of the nation, he is still under 
the control of the military hierarchy who make sure he presents a rigid,
 authoritative image to the rest of the world.

That means that his wife must remain aloof and untouchable in the eyes of the masses, say North Korean experts.
