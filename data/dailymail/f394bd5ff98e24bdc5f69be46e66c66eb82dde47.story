Arizona Governor Jan Brewer has released a private letter to Obama after claims her public spat with him was a publicity stunt to boost her book sales. 

Brewer initially shied away from releasing a copy of her one-page hand-written note, the original of which she handed to Obama during their runway argument on Wednesday over her memoirs which paint a less than flattering picture of the President.

The heated exchange between the pair gave her book, “Scorpions for Breakfast,” a sudden sales boost, reports the New York Daily News.

But Brewer has dismissed claims that 
her finger-pointing spat with the President was a publicity stunt as 
'absolutely ridiculous'.

Despite
insisting at first there was not another copy of the letter which asked
Obama for a meeting, Brewer has now made it public.

In
it, Brewer discussed job creation, the state's balanced budget, and 
renewed her invitation to visit the Mexican border -and buy Obama lunch.

'You've arrived in a state at the forefront of America's recovery — and her future,' she wrote.

'We both love this great country, but we fundamentally disagree on how to best make America grow and prosper once again.'

She signs it 'With respect, Jan'.

Governor
Brewer had greeted the President on his arrival in Phoenix and the pair
were seen engaged in an intense conversation in full view of the press 
at the base of Air Force One's steps.

Both were smiling but speaking at the same time, before Governor Brewer pointed her finger at the President.

'He
brought up my book. And he was a little tense,' Governor Brewer later 
told KFYI radio. 'I asked him if he read my book... he said he read the 
excerpt and he didn't think that I was very cordial... He was somewhat 
thin-skinned, a little tense to say the least. I was trying to be very 
calm.'

Obama has brushed off the disagreement with Republican governor Brewer saying the exchange had been 'blown out of proportion'.

He added that it was good publicity for a Republican to argue with him.

He told ABC's Diane Sawyer: 'This was really not a big deal. She [Brewer] wanted to give
me a letter, asking for a meeting. And I said, ''We'd be happy to meet.''

The President joked: 'I'm usually accused of not being intense enough, right? Too relaxed?'

Brewer's book is a 
memoir of her years growing up. It defends her signing of Arizona's 
controversial law cracking down on illegal immigrants which Obama 
opposes.

Obama was reportedly objecting to Brewer's 
description of a meeting he and Brewer had at the White House, where she
described Obama as lecturing her.

In an interview in November, Brewer 
described two tense meetings. The first took place before his 
commencement address at Arizona State University.

'He did blow me off at
ASU,' she said in the TV interview in November.

She
also described meeting the president at the White House in 2010 to talk
about immigration.

'I felt a little bit like I was being lectured to, 
and I was a little kid in a classroom, if you will, and he was this wise
professor and I was this little kid, and this little kid knows what the
problem is and I felt minimized to say the least.'

On
the tarmac, Brewer handed Obama an envelope with the 
handwritten invitation.

'I said 
to him, you know, I have always respected the office of the president 
and that the book is what the book is. I asked him if he read the book. He said he read the excerpt,' she told reporters.

She said Obama complained that she described him as not treating her 
cordially.

'I said that I was sorry that he felt that way. Anyway, we're glad he's here, and we'll regroup.'

A
White House official said Brewer handed Obama a letter and said she was
inviting him to meet with her.

The official said Obama did note 
that after their last meeting, which the official described as a cordial
discussion in the Oval Office, the governor inaccurately described the 
meeting in her book.

The
full title of the book is Scorpions for Breakfast: My Fight Against 
Special Interests, Liberal Media, and Cynical Politicos to Secure 
America's Border.

In the 
memoir, Governor Brewer accuses the Obama administration of turning a 
blind eye to the problem her state has with illegal immigrants and an 
unprotected border because migrants will help register more Democratic 
votes.
