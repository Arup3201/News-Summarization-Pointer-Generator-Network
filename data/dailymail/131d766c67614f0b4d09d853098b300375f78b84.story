As the end neared, the shrieks became louder, Victoria Azarenka and Bojana Jovanovski trading noises that pummelled the eardrums as much as the groundstrokes that thumped into the turf.

Azarenka’s shrill cry is well known, but just as excruciating was the ‘march on’ sound from Jovanovski with every hit.

Jovanovski edged her esteemed opponent where it mattered, though, the Serb toppling the No 8 seed 6-3, 3-6, 7-5 in an utterly absorbing match that really did not need a soundtrack. Azarenka is twice a semi-finalist here and former world No 1, but she was run ragged by her fearless rival’s brave shot-making.

In the deciding game, the Belarussian 
succumbed from 40-0 up on her service game to slap a backhand long and 
hand the match to the world No 45. Jovanovski had lost her two warm-up 
matches but progresses to the third round for the first time. For 
Azarenka, troubled by a foot injury, it means more time to play table 
tennis with Ernests Gulbis, who also lost in shock circumstances to 
Sergiy Stakhovsky.

The good friends played  ping-pong after dinner recently.

Gulbis
 asked: ‘She didn’t tell you how she lost to me in table tennis? She 
bragged all evening about how good she is in table tennis, but then I 
showed her who’s the true tennis table champion.’
