Arsenal youngster Chuba Akpom has joined Nottingham Forest on loan until the end of the season.

Akpom tweeted: 'Delighted to have joined @Official_NFFC on loan. Can't wait to get started and meet up with the squad after the internationals'.

The Gunners centre forward scored in for England Under 20s on Wednesday night in the win on penalties over Mexico, and also successfully converted his spot-kick in the shootout.

He is expected to appear again for his country in Sunday's friendly with the USA before heading to join up with his new club before they play Wolverhampton Wanderers on Good Friday.

Akpom spent time at Brentford and Coventry City last season in League One, but this is his first Championship loan.
