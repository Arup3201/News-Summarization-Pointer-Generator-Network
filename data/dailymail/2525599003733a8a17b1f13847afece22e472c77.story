Florida's Native Americans have said they will battle to preserve the lands where their ancestors were once imprisoned.

The Seminole Wars, also known as the Florida Wars, were three conflicts between Native Americans who had settled in Florida but were forced to move in the early 18th century by the U.S. Army.

Hundreds of Seminole Tribe members were imprisoned at Egmont Key near the mouth of Tampa Bay by federal officials in the 1850s during the Third Seminole War.

Those Seminoles who did not perish on the island in the harsh conditions were taken by ship to Florida's Panhandle where they were made to continue the journey by land and find new reservations in the west - a journey current-day Seminoles call the 'Voyage of Tears.'

'This is kind of like our holocaust,' said Willie Johns, Seminole Tribe member and historian. 

Johns is a descendent on his father's side of Polly Parker, who was imprisoned. 

On Sunday, direct descendants visited the island and praised Parker's legendary 1858 escape. 

Parker persuaded federal officials to allow her to look for herbs. 

Instead, she fled, with about a dozen other Seminole members which led to an extensive search by U.S. forces.

She eventually returned to her family's camp hundreds of miles south near Lake Okeechobee.

Peter Gallagher, a spokesman for the Seminole Tribe, said: 'Her progeny became many of the leaders and important figures of the tribe ever since.

After leaving Egmont Key, the group planned to continue their journey aboard the Florida Fisherman II northward to St Marks - a 22-hour trip - and then press on for Tallahassee by bus.

Their purpose was to retrace part of the journey of their ancestors and to talk with leaders in the state capital about the preservation of Egmont Key.

The island, which is a national wildlife sanctuary, is less than half the size it was about 100 years ago due to land erosion.

While its white beaches, emerald-colored waters, and inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places due to the lighthouse and the old Fort Dade make it a popular tourist spot for snorkelers and visitors, members of the Seminole Tribe see the erosion as a threat to their history.

They fear that their ancestors' buried remains might one day be washed away and under water like the mostly submerged remnants of Fort Dade.

Mr Johns said: 'From this day on we can help each other in all we do to preserve this place.

Edna Bowers, of Hollywood, Florida, took part in the trip. 

A direct descendent of Parker, she grew up hearing about the hard times that her ancestors endured and all that they overcame.

In the brief stop on Egmont Key, Bowers looked through the historic photographs brought by Woody Hanson of Fort Myers, who says his grandfather - W. Stanley Hanson - was an advocate for the Seminole Tribe and was with Parker when she died.

'It means a lot,' Bowers said about drawing attention to Parker's story.

'I wondered,' Bowers said, 'When she was ever going to be recognised for what she went through.'
