Struggling to sell: Robbie Williams, 40, is struggling to sell Compton Bassett House, near Marlborough, which is on the market for £5.5m

He has already been struggling to find a buyer.

Now, Robbie Williams’ attempts to sell his country mansion risk taking on a whiff of desperation ... due to stinking fumes from a nearby landfill site.

Described as more potent that rotten eggs, the clouds of steam have been plaguing his Wiltshire village with dozens of complaints made to the parish council.

And villagers, who fear the stench will affect house prices, say it is at its worst around the singer’s estate.

The waste management firm that runs the landfill site has even set up a de-odourising system which works in the same way as a household air freshener, pumping out gas to disguise the pong.

Williams, 40, bought Compton Bassett House, which is set in 71 acres of parkland and manicured lawns near Marlborough, for £8.1million in 2009.

But he dropped the price to £5.5million earlier this year after failing to attract a buyer before placing a lavish advertisement in Country Life without a price tag.

One resident, who has logged complaints with the waste contractors through the parish council, said that depending on the wind, the stink can also affect those living near BBC comic Michael McIntyre’s home in a neighbouring village.

He said: ‘It causes people to close their windows. Residents have got fed up with complaining as they can’t see how it’s going to end. It’s depressing.

'The stench is more obnoxious than rotten eggs and will definitely affect house prices. There’s a few bed and breakfasts and it could affect their businesses as nobody wants to stay in a place with a pong.

'The smell is at its worst right by Robbie Williams’ house but if the wind changes direction the gas comes down to my house.’

It is believed heavy rainfall over the winter drenched rubbish that had not yet been covered with earth at the site, around half a mile from Williams’ home.

Then, after the decomposing waste was buried, the water mixture combined with warm weather caused huge amounts of gas to be released.

Williams, who has been living in Los 
Angeles with his wife Ayda, is said to have been searching for a new 
home for his family for more than a year.

He spent £17.5million last 
year on a 46-room West London mansion once owned by film director 
Michael Winner.

The singer is said to want his 11-month-old daughter Theodora Rose to have a British passport and education. McIntyre, 38, spent £2.5million last year on his six-bedroom Wiltshire home.

He left London to live in the stone farmhouse with his wife Kitty and sons Lucas, nine, and six-year-old Oscar.

Pete Szczesiak, chairman of Compton Bassett Parish Council, confirmed it had received complaints about the smell.

He added: ‘There’s a really unpleasant odour and it’s especially strong with all the recent hot weather. We are currently investigating it with the waste contractors.’

Hills Waste Management, which runs the landfill site, said in an email to residents that it was working to stop the smell. It is not known what gas is being used to cover the fumes as part of its de-odourising system.

Spokesmen for both Williams and McIntyre were unable to comment.
