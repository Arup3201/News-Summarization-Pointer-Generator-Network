Pressure is mounting on John Bercow over claims he is too biased against the Tories to remain as Commons Speaker.

An anonymous Commons motion is already circulating in Parliament demanding he go after failing to ‘live up to the tradition of impartiality’ of his predecessors.

Now outgoing Commons clerk, Sir Robert Rogers, has pointedly highlighted that the 'really remarkable powers' Mr Bercow enjoys depend on him being fair to all political parties.

A Commons motion has been drafted accusing John Bercow of failing to ‘live up to the tradition of impartiality’ of his predecessors, and demanding an immediate search for a replacement

He added: ‘So this clerk will be sorely missed by 
the House and by me. We don’t know why he has chosen to retire early, 
though his working environment behind closed doors has not always been 
easy, as those in the know have already alluded.’

Criticism of Mr Bercow has mounted in recent weeks, after he has appeared to repeatedly mock David Cameron in the Commons and faced accusations of being rude to staff.

Aides to the Speaker were forced to deny claims made in the Commons chamber that part of the reason for Sir Robert's early retirement was he had been told to 'f*** off’ by Mr Bercow.

In an interview with The Guardian, Sir Robert refuses to be drawn on the state of strained relations with the Speaker. 

He said: 'We give advice in confidence, and the other side of that coin is that personal relationships are also in confidence. 

'Were that not so, we would start to breakdown the relationship of trust that rightly exists between officers of the house and the MPs. Wherever you start to break that trust down, you do the relationship damage.'

But in a thinly-veiled swipe at Mr Bercow, amid swirling rumours of plots to oust him being bein too pro-Labour, Sir Robert added:  'All I can say is that historically, the House has given the Speaker, the chair, really remarkable powers and that rests on the tradition of impartiality and being a servant of the house, something which dates back to Arthur Onslow in the 18th century. 

'I think I would leave that there as a statement of the relationship between the Speaker and the House.'

Senior Tory MPs are privately plotting how to remove Mr Bercow from his post after the next election.

Even some Labour frontbenchers are 'fed up' with his patronising manner during debates, and are unhappy at the way he has berated some of their own MPs. 

The anonymous letter is thought to have been sent to several MPs and journalists in Parliament

One of the most bizarre exchanges came this week, as Mr Cameron took questions during a lengthy sessions on Gaza and the Malaysian Airlines MH17 atrocity.

Mr Bercow interrupted proceedings to say: ‘Somebody asked how long the statement would run, but I would just point out, if I may, that there is intense interest in it and that the frequency of the Prime Minister’s tennis playing on the one hand and his jogging regime on the other means that he is quite fit enough, I am sure.’

A draft Commons motion, seen by MailOnline, has been circulated in Parliament in an attempt to step up pressure on the 51-year-old to quit.

Tory MP Michael Fabricant last week accused Mr Bercow of telling the Commons Clerk Sir Robert Rogers to 'f*** off'

The Early Day Motion criticising Mr Bercow has not been formally tabled, and does not appear to have been signed.

It states: ‘This House regrets that the Speaker has failed to live up to the tradition of impartiality established by his predecessors; notes his increasingly erratic behaviour; condemns his systematic bullying and humiliation of staff, which has no place in modern society, and especially not in a Parliament which should set a national example; and therefore resolves to proceed immediately to the election of a new Speaker, in which he shall not be a candidate.’

A similar motion was used by Tory MP Douglas Carswell to help to unseat the last Speaker, Labour MP Michael Martin, in June 2009.

Tory MP Michael Fabricant, who denies being behind the letter, said at the weekend: ‘Parliament deserves better than hot-headed, unpredictable and foul-mouthed John Bercow.

'The sooner we get a new Speaker, the better. Bercow should go,’ he wrote in the Mail on Sunday.

It followed his claim in the Commons that Mr Bercow swore at Sir Robert.

The Speaker immediately denied the allegation about Sir Robert Rogers, saying: ‘I’ll ignore that last observation which suffered from the disadvantage of being wrong.’

But Mr Fabricant stood by the claim, declaring he does not believe things should be ‘swept under the carpet’.

Earlier this year Mr Bercow tried to humiliate Mr Cameron in the Commons by cutting him off mid-sentence.

During raucous exchanges at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron was shouted down by Labour MPs and interrupted by Mr Bercow.

As the PM tried to protest that he had not finished, the Speaker hit back: 'He can take it from me that he is finished.' 

Last year relations reached such a low that MPs designed badges with three bees pictured, to show they were members of the BBB club: ‘Bol****ed By Bercow’.
