A husband who stabbed his wife in the heart told a court that his ‘whole world collapsed’ and he lost control when she said she wanted a divorce.

Mark Arthur, 50, said he had ‘tunnel vision’ and could hear his own heart  racing in the moments before he took a kitchen knife and killed his wife Heather in their home.

The former British Airways manager, 51,  had just confessed that she was in love with another man and was leaving him.

Mark Arthur, 50,  told the court he snapped after his wife Heather, left, told him she was having an affair with jazz saxophonist Paul Gowland, 44, right, and wanted to divorce him and sell their house, the court heard

Street: Arthur said he could hear his own heart racing as he and his wife rowed at their house in Gosforth

Newcastle Crown Court heard that in 
the weeks before her death Mrs Arthur had planned to leave her husband 
for jazz saxophonist Paul Gowland, 44, whom she had met in a local band.

Yesterday Arthur wept
 in the witness box as he recalled their argument following her 
confession, how he stabbed her and then tried to perform CPR.

He
 was arrested after running to his GP surgery in his boxer shorts to get
 medical help, saying he had hurt his wife, jurors were told.

The
 self-employed IT consultant said he felt as if his ‘whole world 
collapsed’ as his wife accused him of being ‘manipulative and 
controlling’.

‘I 
remember my blood pressure went through the roof. I could actually hear 
my own heart beat while I was trying to picture these things Heather was
 saying to me,’ he said.

‘My
 heart was beating so fast I don’t know how I did not have a heart 
attack. It was racing. I do remember I developed a sort of tunnel 
vision.

'I could only see clearly in this very small area straight ahead in front of my eyes. Everything was out of focus and pink.

Arthur said he had been unaware of his wife's affair with Mr Gowland, pictured above with Mrs Arthur

‘I
 picked up the knife which must have been right on the  desk and then I 
remember both of Heather’s hands wrapped around my hand and at this  
point I am pulling the knife away from Heather.’

He added: ‘I could not understand why somebody I loved  this much was attacking me  so viciously.

‘The shock of all of this coming out in the way that it did just made me very, very angry and the anger came out.

'Suddenly
 all the things that had been going on in the past couple of weeks 
clicked into place and my whole world collapsed in a second. Just like 
that.

‘She said she was going to seek a divorce, she said that the house was going to be sold and she would keep most of the money.

‘Everything that I thought I knew has just gone.’

With his voice breaking, he described standing over his wife, still wearing his dressing gown and brandishing the knife.

He added: ‘In the end I remember standing up and pushing forwards and that is when Heather got stabbed.

‘When I looked in Heather’s eyes I thought she was dead and I just spiralled into despair and my brain was shutting down.

‘I couldn’t believe what had just happened. I was not sure what was going on was real.’

Mrs Arthur was found by police with a knife in her chest at the couple's home in Gosforth, Newcastle, last April

Following
 his arrest at the doctors’ surgery, Arthur struggled to remember in 
police interviews what had happened, the court was told.

But he denied that he had been controlling and domineering towards his ‘free-spirited’ wife.

He
 claimed that the GPS tracking system which jurors heard he had fitted 
to her phone,  had simply been an application that he had removed when 
she asked him to.

Joanna Greenberg QC, defending, asked whether Arthur had ever ‘contemplated’ harming his wife. He replied: ‘No.’

Earlier
 in the week the court heard the couple, who lived in Gosforth, 
Newcastle, had been together for 30 years after meeting at university in
 London but had been having marriage problems months before her death.

The
 jury heard how Mrs Arthur, who was raised on the Isle of Wight, had 
planned a final family outing to the National Trust home, Wallington 
Hall, with her husband and two children, the day before she was killed.

She
 told her lover Mr Gowland that she planned to confess their affair the 
next day, after dropping the children at school and shopping at 
Sainsbury’s.

Mr Gowland
 told the court he knew his girlfriend planned to tell her husband she 
was leaving him last April and that he was worried for her safety.

He
 urged her to go somewhere with plenty of people around and sent her a 
text message saying: ‘Please watch his every move, honey. You have to be
 careful.’ She replied: ‘I promise I will keep in view of others.’

He told the jury: ‘I was concerned about what might happen, given the defendant’s history.’

When
 he was asked to explain what he meant, he replied: ‘Just violent 
exchanges and unpredictability. She said she walked on egg shells all 
the time and was afraid.

‘She
 had years of unhappiness, felt intimidated, felt threatened in some 
way, didn’t have any freedom in her life, he was always tailing her, 
interrogating her. He was unaffectionate towards her.’

He
 also told the jury that Arthur would spend hours alone working at their
 home while Mrs Arthur was outgoing and frequently went out with 
friends.

He also claimed that the defendant had installed the GPS software on her phone so he could track her movements.

Arthur, of Gosforth, Newcastle, admits the manslaughter of his wife but denies murder.

The trial continues.
