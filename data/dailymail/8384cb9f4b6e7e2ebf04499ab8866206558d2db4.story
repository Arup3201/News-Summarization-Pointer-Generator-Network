This chilling picture shows an arsonist hiding behind a Halloween mask moments after he set an elderly couple's cottage ablaze as they slept inside.

He was captured on CCTV fleeing the scene after he shoved a home-made fire bomb through the letterbox of pensioners Peter and Sylvia Cox at their home in the village of Castle Bytham, Lincolnshire.

The frail pair, aged 83 and 75 respectively, were forced to scramble from an upstairs window with the help of neighbours as flames engulfed their picturesque 17th century home.

They only survived thanks to their beloved greyhound Toby, who woke them by barking as the blaze took hold. The noise also alerted neighbours who brought a ladder from their garage, enabling the Coxes to climb to safety. 

Sadly, Toby was recovering from an operation and would not climb the stairs. He died in the fire, which destroyed the roof of the £400,000, five-bedroom detached stone cottage.

Police have released the picture as they this week issued a fresh appeal for information that could help track down the culprit behind the cold-blooded attack.

Incredibly it was the fourth time the Coxes' home had been targeted by arsonists in a matter of months.

The couple’s home was first attacked in August and October 2010 and again in March and May last year. Each arson attack involved a thug hurling crude petrol bombs using fireworks in glass bottles.

The first three firebombs failed to ignite properly, but on the fourth occasion the couple woke to find their stone cottage filled with smoke.

In a frantic 999 call, a terrified Mr Cox told the operator: 'We’re on fire, the house in on fire and there is smoke everywhere.

'I’m inside and I’m not sure how we can get out.'

'Like a storyline from Midsomer Murders': Police still have no clue why the arsonist, or arsonists, targeted the Coxes

Following the attack on May 4 last year the couple reluctantly moved after police warned them against returning to their home of 30 years.

At the time, the crimes were described as like a ‘story line from Midsomer Murders’ with detectives baffled as to why the couple had been repeatedly targeted.

But despite the repeated fire bomb attacks, the defiant pensioners have now decided to return to the house - even though the arsonist is still at large.

Yesterday, Mr and Mrs Cox said the decision to move back to their home was a difficult one to make.

'We have two daughters living in Staffordshire so we went and stayed with them,' Mr Cox said. 'It was nice to be near them and also the grandchildren and it stopped us thinking about the fire.

'My wife has been very strong. What she said to me, quite sensibly, was we have got to try it (move back home).

'At three o’clock in the afternoon it’s fine, it’s at three o’clock in the morning that it’s not so good.

'But you have to live with it, don’t you?

'It’s our home. It’s the small things you miss, like memories and photographs. Losing those is upsetting because they’re irreplaceable.'

Mrs Cox, a housewife, added: 'We’re OK in the day time, I’m not very good at the night. People said they could never come back like we did, but our life is here.'

As Lincolnshire Police launched their fresh appeal for information, Detective Sergeant Jon Shield, who is leading the investigation, said: 'This was an extremely traumatic experience for the couple and they could easily have been killed in their own home.

'It is important that people visit our website to look at the CCTV images of the suspect that we have already released.

'If anyone knows the man on the bike, wearing a Halloween-style mask, then please get in touch with us as soon as possible.'
