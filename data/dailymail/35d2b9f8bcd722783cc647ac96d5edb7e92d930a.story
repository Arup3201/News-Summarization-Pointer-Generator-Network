The 16-year-old nephew of former racehorse trainer Jenny Pitman has been found hanged at one of Britain's leading public schools.

The flag at Cheltenham College flew at half-mast yesterday after the discovery of Jack Bowlby's body on Friday morning.

Ms Pitman, 66, was last night believed to be at the side of Jack's mother and her youngest sister Mandy, 54, at her home near Lambourn, Berkshire.

Jack was described as a 'star pupil' by staff at the £30,000-a-year school where a spokesman said it appeared he had died in the night. Headmaster

Dr Alex Peterken said: 'This has been a terrible shock for the whole college. We are a close-knit boarding community and it has hit us all very hard indeed.

'A chapel service has already been held for him and our prayers and thoughts go out to his family, friends and peers.'

Jack's housemaster Simon Conner said of him: 'This was a top boy – a star pupil of whom we were all very proud.'

The Bowlbys, like Jenny Pitman, are steeped in racing and Jack had competed at the Royal International Horse Show at Hickstead.

His mother is a former trainer and his father Mike, 48, an ex-jockey. The family run a hay and straw business from their farm.
