Lightning strikes have sparked three separate fires in Western Australia, with lives and homes under threat as wild weather continues across the state.

The Department of Fire and Emergency Services has issued an emergency alert for Sovereign Hill and Redfield Park Estate in Wanerie in the Shire of Gingin - which is almost 100km north of Perth.

DFES said just after 1.30pm local time that homes in the area would be under threat in about three hours.

The out of control and unpredictable bushfire is moving fast in a south westerly direction at 1km/h, with flames burning two metres high.

An average fire usually moves about 300m/h.  

Nearby in the same shire, a watch and act alert has been issued for people in the town of Seabird.

That fire is moving in the same direction and at the same pace as the Wanerie fire.

Spot fires are starting up to 1km ahead of the blaze.

Schools and homes at Eneabba, 278km north of Perth, have been evacuated, according to 9News.

The string of bushfires, also out of control and unpredictable, are burning on both sides of Brand Highway and 30km north of the town. 

A section of the highway between Eneabba and Indian Ocean Drive has been closed, with police diverting traffic. 

Residents who have been moved from their homes have been seeking shelter at a temporary evacuation cenre at the Leeman Recreation Centre in Eneabba's Spencer Street. 

Several spot fires in the metropolitan area have also been caused by lightning.

Severe thunderstorms are expected to hit Perth on Wednesday afternoon, accompanied by damaging winds, large hail and heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding.

The Bureau of Meteorology warns the storms could cause damage to homes and property.

A severe thunderstorm warning has been issued for the Gascoyne, Central West, Lower West and Central Wheat Belt districts.

A BoM spokeswoman said it was possible widespread thunderstorms that were tracking south could bring enough rain to help extinguish the blazes, but they were quite high up at 10,000 feet, so a lot of rain was being lost through evaporation.

She said Badgingarra had recorded the highest rainfall level at 2.6mm.

But with a series of thunderstorms forecast, the atmosphere could moisten, leading to more rainfall, she said.
