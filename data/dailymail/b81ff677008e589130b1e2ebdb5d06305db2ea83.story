The Government’s controversial £50billion high speed HS2 project cleared its latest hurdle as legislation to kick-start its building from London to the North was given the green light.

MPs were told that the High Speed Rail (Preparation) Act 2013 – a so-called ‘paving Bill’ which paves the way for construction - has been formally agreed by the Queen.

It came as Prime Minister David Cameron 
hosted a reception for civic leaders who support the line which is 
blighting the homes of thousands of residents in its path, declaring it:
‘great for the whole country’.

Support: Prime Minister David Cameron receives a declaration of support for HS2 from representatives from the UK's ten largest cities outside of London on the day the Queen formally agreed the bill that will make HS2 a reality

Link: The project, estimated to cost around £50 billion, is intended to link London to Birmingham by 2026, with two branches then heading to Manchester and Leeds, via Sheffield, being built by 2033

The royal assent for the legislation allows the Government to spend money planning the HS2 route in detail and buying up property from residents and businesses along the proposed track.

A more detailed hybrid Bill for its construction will be published early next week.

The latest development coincided with a dozen council chiefs meeting Prime Minister David Cameron in Downing Street to pledge their backing for the £50billion high-speed project.

The leaders posed outside Number 10 with Mr Cameron holding a long banner bearing the words High Speed Rail for High Speed Cities.

Mr Cameron said: ‘Everyone benefits from HS2. It's great for the whole country.’

After the meeting in Downing Street, which was also attended by Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, Manchester City Council leader Sir Richard Leese said: ‘HS2 will benefit London but will benefit regional cities even more, so it's a win-win situation.'

The second phase of HS2 is scheduled to take the line north of Birmingham to north west and north east England by 2032/33.

Sir Richard, who is 62, said: ‘We need high-speed rail to the north sooner and running further. My ambition is to able to ride on the high-speed line from Manchester in my lifetime.’

Birmingham City Council leader Sir Albert Bore said: ‘Mr Cameron supports our view this is all about increasing capacity and bringing economic gain to the country as a whole.’

Leeds City Council member James Lewis added: '2032/33 is a long time to wait and we would like to see work on phase two starting as soon as possible.

‘We are not planning to build any more motorways so the only way the country is going to thrive is through HS2.’

In the Commons former Wales secretary Cheryl Gillan, who has campaigned against HS2, was next to speak in the Commons during a debate on stalking following the announcement from Deputy Speaker Eleanor Laing.

To laughter as MPs recognised the situation, Ms Gillan said: ‘I could have done without the announcement of the royal assent to the Bill, which I think colleagues know causes a great deal of difficulty for constituents in Chesham and Amersham.'

The project, estimated to cost around £50 billion, is intended to link London to Birmingham by 2026, with two branches then heading to Manchester and Leeds, via Sheffield, being built by 2033.

HS2 Ltd chief executive Alison Munro said: ‘The passage of the Paving Bill is a critical milestone in the delivery of the programme, ahead of the deposit of the Hybrid Bill next week.

‘We can now continue to take forward the early activities for delivery of HS2, such as early ground investigation works.

'We will also be able to start working with the private sector on developing skills and training in preparation for the delivery of HS2.’
