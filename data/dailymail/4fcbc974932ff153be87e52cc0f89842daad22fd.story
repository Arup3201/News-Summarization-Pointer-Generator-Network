One of Chancellor George Osborne’s key advisers has been handed a 19 per cent pay rise, it was revealed last night.

Rupert Harrison - who has been described as the 'real Chancellor' and the 'most important person in Government who you've never heard of' - enjoyed an increase last year from £80,000 to £95,000.

The former Eton head boy has been a long-term aide to Mr Osborne, and his salary rise is said to have been prompted by his appointment to the Treasury Council of Economic Advisers.

Dr Harrison, who is the son of a bank manager and a French teacher, is said by government insiders to be talented at coming up with appealing policies to equal electoral objectives.

The 36-year-old father lives in a basement flat in Notting Hill with his lawyer wife Joanna, 37.

The revelation of his pay comes as it emerged that the salary bill for ministers’ special advisers has soared by £1.2million in just one year - despite David Cameron’s pledge to cut the cost of politics.

Figures published yesterday show that there are now 103 so-called ‘spads’ working in Whitehall, at an annual cost to the taxpayer of £8.4million.

This is 17 per cent up on the £7.2million cost the year before, and much higher than the £5.9million bill in Gordon Brown’s last year of power.

The number of special advisers is up on the 98 that were in place a year ago and 71 just after the Coalition took office.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg’s director of communications, Steve Lotinga, was paid £105,000.

Mr Clegg alone has 20 spads – which Labour points out is larger than the number of female MPs he has in his party. The Prime Minister has 26 spads.

The surge comes despite the fact that the Tories promised at the last election to cap the number of spads, and the Liberal Democrats pledged that they should be paid out of political funds not taxpayer coffers.

Mr Cameron said in 2009: ‘If we’re going to take our country through these difficult times, those who lead must lead by powerful example. That means getting our own house in order and cutting the cost of politics.’

But the latest figures, released by the Cabinet Office, show that six advisers are being paid £100,000 or more, with the list topped by Mr Cameron’s chief of staff Ed Llewellyn and his director of communications Craig Oliver, who each received £140,000.

William Hague, Leader of the House, still employs Arminka Helic on a salary of £70,000 – even though she has now been elevated to the Lords.

Angela Eagle, the Shadow Leader of the House of Commons, said: ‘Another day, another broken promise from David Cameron and Nick Clegg.

‘David Cameron promised to get the cost of politics down but under him the number of Special Advisers spirals ever upwards – the public are now picking up bill of over £8million to pay for his appointees.

‘This also shows how you can’t trust a word Nick Clegg says. The Lib Dems used to say that Special Advisers shouldn’t be paid for by the public but as soon as he got his feet under the Cabinet table he broke his word.

‘The cost to the public of Lib Dem Special Advisers is over £1.7million – Nick Clegg alone has more advisers working for him than he has female MPs.

‘This is a Government which breaks its promises and leaves hardworking people to pick up the bill.’

John O’Connell, director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘There’s nothing wrong in principle with ministerial staff but their salaries have got to be kept under the same tight control as everybody else’s in the public sector.

‘David Cameron promised before he was elected that the cost of politics would go down under his watch, and politicians should keep their promises.’

Answering business questions in the Commons, Mr Hague said the rising numbers reflected the ‘nature of coalition’ and that their average pay was actually lower than it had been under the previous Labour government.

The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said that special advisers’ pay was now on average £5,000 a year less than it had been under the last government.

A spokesman for the Cabinet Office said the increase in the number of spads reflects coalition working and the 24/7 demands placed on ministers.

‘As part of this Government’s long-term economic plan, we are making efficiencies from the Civil Service, which is now 21 per cent smaller than it was at the time of the 2010 general election,’ he said.

‘Workforce reductions and pension reforms saved £4.7billion last year, compared to a 2009/10 baseline. Special advisers perform an important function and their average salary cost is 8 per cent lower now than under the previous government.’
