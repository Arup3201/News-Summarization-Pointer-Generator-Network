Exeter gave their Aviva Premiership play-off hopes a massive boost by sinking Harlequins 32-21 at the Stoop.

Rob Baxter's men suffered a terrible first half after Phil Dollman was sent to the sin-bin in the 15th minute following Ian Whitten's yellow card eight minutes earlier.

Down to 13 men and trailing 8-0 after 15 minutes, Exeter fought back to lead 16-11 at half-time thanks to an opportunistic try from Ben White and three Henry Slade penalties.

Nick Evans kept Quins in touch with a try and 11 points from the boot but it was his opposite number Slade who stole the show in the second half as the Saxons fly-half scored 16 points to secure the victory.

Quins piled on the pressure early on as Ugo Monye, Danny Care and Charlie Matthews made strong surges towards the Chiefs line. Exeter winger Whitten took a gamble and rushed off his line to block Luke Wallace's attempted pass with Quins players to spare outside him.

Referee Matthew Carley did not hesitate and dispatched Whitten to the bin for his professional foul and Evans made no mistake from the tee to give the home side an early 3-0 lead.

It got worse for the Chiefs in the 15th minute as Dolman was given his marching orders for a shoulder charge on Marland Yarde who looked destined to score in the right corner.

Down to 13 players, it was only a matter of time before the Exeter line was breached and Quins soon had their first try when quick hands across the backline allowed Evans to glide over unopposed. The Kiwi dragged his conversion attempt right as the Londoners raced into an 8-0 lead.

Whitten returned from his spell in the bin in the 17th minute with Slade firing over a penalty to get his side on the scoreboard after a testing opening quarter.

Exeter took the lead in the 22nd minute when openside White charged down Care's attempted box-kick and regathered to crash over with Slade tagging on the extras to make it 10-8.

Slade had a chance to further extend Exeter's lead in the 27th minute but his penalty smashed off the right upright allowing Quins to clear their lines.

The Chiefs fly-half added another penalty before Evans cut Exeter's lead to two points in the 32nd minute when hooker Dave Ward was tackled high.

Exeter still managed to have the final say before half-time, however, as Quins were penalised at the resulting scrum allowing Slade to convert his third successful penalty of the afternoon.

The visitors extended their lead after the break as Slade raced onto Jack Nowell's superb offload to cross the Quins whitewash. The Chiefs number 10 converted his own score as Exeter took a 23-11 lead.

Evans kicked a 57th-minute penalty to keep Quins in touch but Slade cancelled out that effort almost immediately as the home side were caught offside from the kick-off.

The Slade show continued as the Chiefs playmaker knocked over another penalty to give his side a 15-point cushion.

Matt Hopper gave Quins hope with an audacious finish in the corner late on, but Slade made the result safe with his sixth penalty of the match.

Quins battered Exeter's line late on in search of a losing bonus point with Thomas Waldrom in the sin-bin but the Chiefs stood firm.
