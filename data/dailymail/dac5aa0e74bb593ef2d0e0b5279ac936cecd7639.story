A woman who was seriously wounded in the Boston Marathon bombings has made an emotional plea to find an unknown Afghanistan war veteran who stayed by her side during the horrific ordeal.

Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick told a news conference on Tuesday that while meeting the injured at Tufts Medical Center he spoke to a young woman called Victoria, a student at North Eastern University.

She had sustained a serious shrapnel wound to her leg in the first blast on Monday afternoon and was by her own description, 'completely hysterical'.

Plea: Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick asked the public to help him find Army Sgt 'Tyler' who helped a seriously injured young woman following the Boston Marathon bomb blasts

Victoria said that she had been carried to a medical tent where she was comforted by a man called Tyler, an oil rig worker.  He managed to calm the young woman over her injuries.

A hospital spokeswoman said that Tyler told Victoria: 'You’re going to have a scar, but you’re going to be OK. It’ll be like my scar', according to the Boston Globe.

Governor Patrick said it was unclear whether Tyler had been working in the medical tent or, like so many others, simply rushed to help the wounded.

The Governor asked for the public's help to track down Tyler as Victoria desperately wanted to thank him personally after he was there for her in the midst of her distress.

Anyone with information on 'Tyler' was asked to call 617-725-4000 so that he could be put in touch with Victoria.

Help: Medical workers aid injured people near the finish line

Victoria is among 183 injured following the Boston Marathon terror attack including nine children. Among those wounded, 23 people are in a critical condition.

Three people died in the bomb blasts - eight-year-old Martin Richard; Krystle Campbell, 29, and a Boston University graduate student who is yet to be named.

The two bombs which wreaked the devastation were made from six-liter pressure cookers crammed with shards of metal, nails and ball bearings and stashed in black backpacks, police sources revealed on Tuesday.
