A Cambridge academic who was gored by a giant stag has been put into a coma after undergoing an operation to try to repair the severe damage to her windpipe.

Kate Stone, 44, from Cambridge, was injured by the animal near Fort William in the Scottish Highlands in the early hours of Monday.

She was conscious and lay critically injured in a garden shed for 20 minutes while paramedics rushed 15 miles to get to her remote location, it emerged today.

'Serious but stable': Dr Kate Stone was gored in the neck by a stag in the early hours of Monday

She was treated by paramedics before being taken to Fort William's Belford hospital, and later transferred by air to the Southern General in Glasgow.

A statement released by a colleague at Dr Stone's print firm, Novalia, said she had an operation late yesterday afternoon to try to repair damage to her trachea, (windpipe).

The 44-year-old is a keen hiker and outdoor enthusiast

It said: 'The operation went well and she remained stable throughout.

'The doctors made a decision to keep her in an induced coma for the next week to minimise any movement that may rupture the wound.

'She remains in a stable condition and she is now in the healing process from the first operation.

'Her family are with her over this new year period and all her friends are continuing to offer Dr Stone was on holiday in the Scottish Highlands when the animal charged into her from out of the darkness, and she now needs an operation to fully reconnect her windpipe.

Friends watched in horror as the spooked red deer lowered its head and impaled her on its antlers in a 'one-in-a-million' accident on Monday.

They reportedly carried her into a 
shed for protection from the elements and believe she may have been 
targeted above her friends because she is very tall.

Dr Stone was treated by paramedics at the scene in Lochailort who arrived from the fishing port of Mallaig, 15 miles away.

She was then taken to Fort William's Belford hospital, and later transferred by air to the Southern General, in Glasgow.

A statement released today said she is in a critical but stable condition, and 'doctors expect to operate in the next few days to repair damage to her trachea'.

It continued: 'Her sister and friends are with her and have received messages of support from her many friends around the world. Our love and support goes to Kate and we wish her all the best for the speediest possible recovery.'

Dr Stone was standing with a group of friends outside a private residence in Lochailort when the incident happened. She had been on a short break in the Highlands, staying at the Mo-Dhachaidh B&B.

Idyllic: The countryside close to Fort William where Dr Stone and friends were celebrating the festive period before the terrible attack

Dr Stone, 44, and a group of friends 
were on a three-day festive break and had been at a ceilidh on Sunday 
evening before being invited back to local musician Jim Hunter’s home at
 Lochailort, near Fort William.

The group were laughing and chatting, said Mr Hunter.

‘We had been to the pub up the road and were coming back to my house through the gate', he went on.

'It was pitch black and we were using torches to navigate our way back and the big stag must have got trapped in the garden as we have deer fences around it.

'It must have panicked when it saw us and the only way out was through the gate that we were standing at. It just ran at us and went straight through us.

‘Kate was at the back of the group and its antlers must have caught her in the neck. The stag then made for the hills. It was a completely freakish accident, I’ve never seen the like of it before.

‘I think I know the one it is, it’s 
been hanging around. It’s a three-year-old stag, around 150kg. These are
 big fellas, you don’t mess with them, they’ll take your car out.’

The group initially thought Dr Stone had simply been knocked over but quickly realised that it was more serious.

She was rushed to hospital in Fort William but then flown by air ambulance for specialist treatment at Glasgow’s Southern General Hospital, where she is understood to be in intensive care.

Dr Stone, who has two children, is a research engineer in the Institute of Manufacturing at Cambridge and has set up her own technology company, Novalia.

She was part of a group of three men and four women visiting the area – hill walking and enjoying the scenery – and staying at the Mo-Dhachaidh Guest House.

Owner Gary Burton, 51, said: ‘No one here has heard of anything like this in their lifetime, it has shocked the community.

‘It’s a cornered stag with no alternative exit route, it would have just been in a panic. It had nowhere else to go but through the group and unfortunately it seems Kate was in the way.

‘The force of the attack and impact must have been ferocious. I went to the scene later and found Kate’s mobile phone smashed into tiny bits.

‘I understand the type of injury Kate has suffered can cause quadriplegia or paraplegia.

She was telling me she enjoyed the 
outdoors in the hills and camping on her own in remote places, so any 
form of paralysis to such an active person will be a disaster.’

One local gamekeeper with more than 40 years of experience with Highland stags said he had never heard of such an incident.

He added: ‘For a stag to come out of the darkness like this and go for someone is highly unusual – a chance in a million.’

In November, a deer farmer died after being attacked by a stag. Kenneth Price, 75, was gored in Llandysul, Wales.
