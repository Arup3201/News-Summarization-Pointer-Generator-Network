Ministers were shamed into witholding a £16million aid payment to Rwanda last night following mounting criticism of their support for a regime accused of serious human rights abuses.

The Department for International Development (DFID) confirmed that the payment had been blocked indefinitely while officials investigate evidence that Rwanda has been fuelling a bloody civil war in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo.

The move is a major embarrassment for the Government, which has been a staunch defender of the Rwandan government and its controversial president Paul Kagame, who was due in London last night for the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games.

Bloodmoney? Aid payments from the UK to Rwanda have been blocked while officials investigate evidence that Rwanda has been fuelling a bloody civil war in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo

David Cameron and International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell have publicly defended Kagame, despite mounting allegations of human rights abuses within both Rwanda and its neighbours.

Tony Blair is also an enthusiastic supporter of Kagame, and has described him as a ‘visionary leader’ and a ‘great friend’.

Accusations: Rwanda's controversial president Paul Kagame

Kagame’s regime is heavily dependent on 
foreign aid, which accounts for a third of its annual budget, and 
Britain is the tiny East African country’s biggest foreign donor.

This year it is due to give £75million. The Dutch government suspended its entire aid programme to the country earlier this week, and Washington has also frozen military support.

Now, apparently stung by criticism that they were ‘turning a blind eye’ to human rights abuses, UK ministers have also decided to act.

Carina Tertsakian of the campaign group Human Rights Watch said the Government’s support for Kagame’s regime was ‘becoming embarrassing’.

Welcoming the suspension of aid, she said: ‘DFID has provided almost unconditional support to Rwanda, despite abundant evidence of human rights violations inside Rwanda, and Rwanda’s persistent interference in armed conflict in neighbouring Congo.

‘We hope that this signals a long-overdue shift in UK policy on Rwanda, and that the Government will now take a strong stand not only on Rwanda’s role in fuelling the deadly conflict in Congo, but on severe restrictions on freedom of expression inside Rwanda.

Rwanda remains a country ruled by fear, in which opposition parties are not allowed to function, and people end up in prison simply for daring to criticise the government.’

Mr Mitchell, who visited Rwanda last week, said he had delivered a ‘frank’ message to Kagame about alleged human rights abuses.

A DFID spokesman said the aid payment 
had been delayed while Mr Mitchell considers whether Rwanda is meeting 
its commitment to respect human rights, a key element in any British aid
programme.

Tony Blair described Kagame as a 'visionary leader' and a 'great friend' while David Cameron has publicly defended him, despite mounting allegations of human rights abuses

Two years ago the United Nations published a damning report alleging appalling war crimes by the Tutsi army in 1995, which Kagame led.

But supporters of President Kagame insist that his record has to be seen in the context of his country’s war-torn recent history.

Kagame disputes the UN findings.
