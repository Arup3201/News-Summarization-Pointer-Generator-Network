A couple held their tiny baby son for the first time as newlyweds just minutes after tying the knot in a horror themed wedding.

Margaret, 28, and Ross Patterson, 31, said their vows and then rushed to visit eight-week-old baby Drake in a hospital's neo-natal intensive care unit.

Drake had been born 14 weeks premature and needed round the clock medical care as medics feared he may not survive.

'After our ceremony Ross and I travelled to the hospital to see our son. The nurses had decorated the room with a Halloween theme,' said Mrs Patterson

The couple had already suffered the agony of two miscarriages and were delighted when Mrs Carrey fell pregnant again last year.

The pair, from Wishaw, Lanarkshire, are both rock fans and love goth fashion and had set about planning their ghoulish themed wedding celebrations.

Mrs Patterson said: 'Ross and I met online and a year later I proposed to him and we began planning our life together.

When baby Drake was born early in August and kept in Wishaw General Hospital's neo-natal unit they thought their plans would have to scrapped

Mrs Patterson said that when she was just over four months pregnant she was taken to hospital with back ache and the doctors told her the baby was on the way

'I fell pregnant but had two miscarriages, we were beside ourselves with grief.

'In
 time we got on with things and started planning our dream wedding but 
then I found out I was pregnant again and we were ecstatic.

'I had to let my wedding dress fitter know I'd need extra room as I'd be nearly nine months pregnant.

'But
 when I was just over four months pregnant I was taken to hospital with 
back ache and the doctors told me the baby was on the way.

'I
 just managed to tell Ross to call the dress fitting shop to tell them 
not to let out my dress as I wouldn't have a bump at the wedding, but a 
baby.'

'We organised funeral cars for our wedding cars. The coffin even came with a skeleton and fake blood in the back of the car,' said Mr Patterson

Mr Patterson, a car sprayer, said: 'We love Halloween and are known for our parties so we thought it would be a day to remember if we had our wedding that day'

When baby Drake was born early in August and kept in Wishaw General Hospital's neo-natal unit they thought their plans would have to scrapped.

However as Drake, who weighed just 1lb 5oz, showed signs of recovering in the unit, they pressed on with the spooky Halloween big day that featured fancy dress, a coffin and a hearse.

But as soon as they were officially husband and wife the raced back to the neonatal unit to celebrate the event with their young son.

Mrs Patterson added: 'He was so tiny and perfect and we knew Drake would need to be included in our day to make it special.

Drake is now eight months old and made a full recovery after his spell in hospital

'We did all our wedding pictures there and got the first hold of him as man and wife,' said Mrs Patterson

'Most of our guests came dressed up and we organised funeral cars for our wedding cars.

'The coffin even came with a skeleton and fake blood in the back of the car.

'Everyone had such a good day and it was made all the better because we got to see Drake.

'He is eight months now and going strong.'
