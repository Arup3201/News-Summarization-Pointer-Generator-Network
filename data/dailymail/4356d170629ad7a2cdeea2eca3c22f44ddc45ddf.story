While Louis van Gaal was taking charge of Manchester United for the first time at Old Trafford, former United boss Sir Alex Ferguson was enjoying something his old club will be missing this season - European football.

The Old Trafford legend was in Cardiff to watch Real Madrid take on Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup.

Ferguson saw Cristiano Ronaldo, whose development he oversaw before selling the World Player of the Year to Madrid for a world record transfer fee, score twice for the Champions League holders, and was on hand to congratulate the Real Madrid forward.

Ronaldo, who was named man of the match for his two-goal performance, spotted his former manager in the crowd and reacted with delight.

He later dedicated his individual award to the former United boss: ‘I am happy because I scored these two goals and I want to thank Sir Alex for handing me the man of the match trophy.

‘He helped me a lot when I was just 18 in Manchester and I want to say I respect him and thank him so much for everything he did in my career.'

Since leaving United Ferguson has become a coaching ambassador for UEFA, and he was in Cardiff as part of that role.

His former club, who have struggled in his absence, nicked a 2-1 win over Valencia thanks to a last minute goal from Marouane Fellaini 

Cardiff City owner Vincent Tan was also in attendance at the Super Cup as local boy Gareth Bale made his return to the city.
