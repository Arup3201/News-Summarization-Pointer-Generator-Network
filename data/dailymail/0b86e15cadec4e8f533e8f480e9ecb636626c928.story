Former British Airways pilot Bartle Frere has been found guilty of soliciting sex from boys in India

A disgraced former British Airways pilot is facing jail after being found guilty of soliciting sex from children during stopovers in exotic locations.

Bartle Frere, a captain with the airline, was convicted of two counts of arranging to meet boys for sex while on layovers in India.

He was also found guilty of having six DVDs of naked Ukranian boys at his home in Shipton Gorge, Dorset.

He now faces a re-trial on 17 other charges, including five of performing sex acts on a boy under 16 in Dorset between 2001 and 2003, after the jury were unable to reach a verdict.

Police arrested Frere, a longhaul pilot, on November 10 last year as he arrived back in the UK following a flight to Bangkok, Thailand.

During the trial at Bournemouth Crown Court, jurors were told how Frere, 50, had messaged boys in India using social network Facebook in 2007 and 2008.

The messages were found on his computer when police raided his home the day before his arrest.

They seized his mobile phone and it was alleged that the day before his arrest he had searched the internet for the term ‘where to pick up underage boys in Bangkok’.

During the prosecution’s opening speech, Elizabeth Bussey-Jones told the court said: 'Conversations sent electronically indicated he was meeting these boys during his role as a pilot.

'In one 
string of messages he apologises to one boy for not coming to Chennai 
but said he was trying to swap his flights with another pilot.

'Mr Frere wrote: "I want to hug you and have a bath with you and cuddle you in bed".'

Frere was also found guilty of six counts of possessing child 
pornography after officers found DVDs of naked Ukrainian boys in his 
attic. He now faces a retrial on 17 other counts

After Frere was arrested, detectives had 
to call in MI5 to help crack the security codes to 25 different 
heavily-encrypted storage devices at Frere’s home.

Once
 opened, investigators found video footage of one of the alleged UK 
victims, indecent photographs of children, web searches for underage sex
 websites and a copy of an infamous book related to paedophilia, the 
court heard.

Police also uncovered six different DVDs of naked boys at the house in the same raid.

During
 his defence Frere said he found young boys 'aesthetically pleasing' but
 denied any sexual attraction, calling himself 'asexual'.

Undecided:

He said he had sent the messages to the Indian boys to 'shock them' into realising how easily they could be preyed on.

Frere, an amateur filmmaker, told police in an interview that he had bought the DVDs to study them artistically.

The
 jury of eight women and three men unanimously agreed Frere was guilty 
of six counts of possessing indecent photographs of children.

They found him guilty of arranging on two counts of facilitating the commission of child sex offence by a majority of 10-1.

The
 jury was then discharged after the foreman told the judge they would 
not be able to reach a 10-1 majority verdict on 17 other charges.

Addressing the jury, judge Peter Thompson said: “I discharge you from returning any further verdicts.

'It
 is quite clear you have paid a great deal of attention to this case. 
There is no blame or shame to be felt by any of you that you have not 
been able to find verdicts on the outstanding counts.'

He told the CPS it has 14 days to inform the court if it intends to retry Frere, and that any trial would take place in 2015.

Chris
 Stopper, prosecuting, told the court he was '99 per cent certain' the 
Crown Prosecution Service would seek a retrial on the outstanding 
counts.

Frere, was released on conditional bail to an address in Abingdon, Oxfordshire.

Frere said he took monthly British Airways flights to Chennai (pictured). He also admitted finding nude boys 'fascinating', but denied soliciting sex, describing himself as 'asexual'
