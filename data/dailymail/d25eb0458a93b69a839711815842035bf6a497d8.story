Vulnerable pensioners may be at risk of poor care and even abuse because so many home helps cannot speak English properly, a government adviser warned yesterday.

Agencies must ensure care workers have decent language skills before placing them in people’s homes, she said.

One in five carers is a migrant, according to research by King’s College London. In some cities, it is thought around half of care workers are foreign nationals.

Dr Shereen Hussein said that if carers cannot speak English properly, they risk being badly treated by patients

Dr Shereen Hussein, scientific adviser
 to the Department of Health, said changes to immigration policy and the
 relaxation of EU labour rules has altered the profile of migrants who 
work as carers in the UK.

Many
 agencies do not adequately test language skills during interviews – 
leading to risks that the elderly could become victims of ‘bad 
treatment’, she said.

While 
migrants from outside the European Union are subject to rigorous 
language tests, this is not the case for those who come from within it.

More
 and more care workers are now from EU accession countries such as 
Poland and Hungary, where no language testing is required.

Dr
 Hussein told the BBC: ‘This means new migrants can be vulnerable when 
they’re placed in people’s homes – and carers have reported instances of
 racism and discrimination that stem from communication problems.

‘It
 would be really beneficial to have a standard interview process to 
establish English language proficiency, communication skills and softer 
skills of all care workers aiming to work in the sector.

‘At
 the moment, vulnerable workers are placed in the homes of vulnerable 
adults with complex needs, and sometimes communication problems can 
result in bad treatment for both parties.’

Prime Minister David Cameron told the Commons that he wanted to make sure people in the care system are properly trained

One
 man, who wishes to remain anonymous, has a 62-year-old brother with a 
severe form of dementia. He employed carers for 18 months to oversee the
 care of his brother, but grew frustrated with the quality of the staff.

He told 5 Live Breakfast the situation grew so problematic he took the decision to put his brother in a care home.

‘The dynamic between the carers and a frightened man who was suffering with dementia didn’t work most of the time,’ he said.

‘Almost
 all the carers were from overseas, mainly from Poland. I found some of 
them exceptionally difficult to understand, which meant my brother, in 
his condition, was never going to understand them and the reaction from 
him was to hide or get slightly violent.’

Dr
 Hussein, of King’s College London’s social care workforce research 
unit, added: ‘In the majority, migrant workers are very hard-working, 
but sometimes when their English language is quite poor, that can put 
both carers and the user in very vulnerable situations – especially if 
they are the only carer.

‘Interview
 standards are variable. We heard from care workers who admitted that 
their English is not very good, and the interview process is quite 
easy.’

Under Brussels right
 to freedom of movement rules, it would be considered a breach to 
prevent someone taking a job on the basis of their language alone.

The BBC spoke to some former care workers from Hungary, who told of their struggles to communicate with clients.

Hajnalka
 Deak, who came to the UK in 2008, said: ‘To do the job you have to 
understand the doctor’s instructions, report to relatives and speak to 
agencies.

‘You have to help clients do things they can’t do for themselves, and it’s essential to understand their instructions.

‘I
 remember once I worked with a wheelchair user. I had to strap him in 
the car. Unfortunately I couldn’t understand the exact instructions and 
we had to stay at home and couldn’t go anywhere. I felt partly 
embarrassed and partly frustrated.’

But
 Colin Angel, of the UK Home Care Association, which represents care 
agencies, said there was not enough money for language training because 
of council cuts.

The Government is bringing in a new ‘care certificate’ to ensure carers have the necessary skills.

Care
 minister Norman Lamb added: ‘Employers are responsible for recruiting 
staff who can competently speak and read English but communication will 
be a key part of the Care Certificate.'
