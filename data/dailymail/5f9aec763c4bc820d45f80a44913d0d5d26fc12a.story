Every day Sportsmail takes a look at the European papers to see what are the biggest stories creating talking points on the continent.

Let's start in Spain where it would seem Gareth Bale is finally being given some credit following his impressive two-goal display for Wales against Israel on Friday night.

Madrid-based newspaper Marca lead with an image of Bale and a headline which reads 'Yes, like this Bale', as they report on the Welshman's performance. 

Madrid newspaper Marca report that their is still a bright future for Gareth Bale at Real Madrid

Marca believes the forward's future could still be bright at Madrid if he 'starts from the centre with total freedom in attack and without defensive obligations'.

The same Spanish newspaper slated Bale less than two weeks ago after Madrid's 2-1 El Clasico defeat at the Nou Camp for which Marca rated his performance as zero. 

Now, however, Marca hint that Bale will be able to shine even given the right role at the Bernabeu.

Elsewhere is Spain, AS report that Sergio Ramos 'does not feel valued' at Madrid as talks stall over a new contract for the Spanish defender.

Mundo Deportivo claim that Barcelona are planning a 'secret' swoop for Juventus star Paul Pogba, who has been attracting attention from the biggest clubs across Europe. 

'Barca are prepared to sign the Frenchman and loan him for one more year to his current club Juventus', reports Mundo Deportivo. 

To Italy now, where Tuttosport reveal that a group players are speaking out in support of under-fire boss Antonio Conte.

Conte has received death threats from angry fans who blame his training methods for the injury which was initially believed to have ruled midfielder Claudio Marchisio out for the rest of the season.

'Everyone for Conte' reads the headline as Tuttusport claim that Juve's Azzurri stars have launched an appeal to the fans ahead of Tuesday's international friendly against England.
