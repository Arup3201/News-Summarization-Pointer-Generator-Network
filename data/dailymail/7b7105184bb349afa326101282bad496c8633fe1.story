Yaya Toure has apologised to the Manchester City faithful for his red card during his side's defeat to CSKA Moscow.

Toure was the second City player to be sent off on a dismal night at the Etihad, following Fernandinho's earlier dismissal. Toure shoved CSKA midfielder Roman Eremenko in the face nine minutes from time. 

The Ivorian had hauled Manuel Pellegrini's side level with a stunning free kick but Seydou Doumbia's second goal earned the Russian visitors all three points.

Toure tweeted: 'City fans - I am sorry for my red card. I feel it is important to apologise for this.'

The 31-year-old midfielder had earlier tweeted: 'GameDay... #Focused'.

City are now bottom of their group and face an uphill task to qualify for the knockout stages.

Pellegrini must lift his side for the visit of Bayern Munich before what could be a decisive trip to Rome for the final fixture. 

The manager told Sky Sports 5: 'It's very difficult to understand why we played so badly.

'From the beginning we were so nervous and we gave them the two goals. Really, we didn't play.

'The first half especially, we didn't see the team we normally see. We didn't shoot once at their goal, we just had Yaya's free-kick, and we gave away two easy goals.

'It's a strange moment to understand why it happened. I don't think it's just this competition, the last two weeks we are not playing the way we normally do.

'It's a crisis of confidence, of course, I don't understand why but we must find a reason, talk with the players every day and try to win again.'

Pellegrini would not be drawn on the two dismissals, saying simply: 'It's the referee that has to decide about that.'
