Abuse: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said using Twitter was not an excuse for 'grotesque' behaviour

Nick Clegg today backed a police operation to arrest Twitter trolls who have posted vile abuse and threats of rape.

The Deputy Prime Minister said arrests this week ‘sent out a signal’ that using online messaging is not an excuse for ‘totally unacceptable behaviour’.

Mr Clegg warned: ‘Just because you tweet something doesn’t mean you can start behaving in a grotesque, offensive, abusive and sometimes criminal way.’

He spoke out after it emerged internet trolls have been targeting female Cabinet ministers with threats of rape on video website YouTube.

Several Cabinet ministers including Home Secretary Theresa May, Culture Secretary Maria Miller and International Development Secretary Justine Greening are among women who have been the target of a series of abusive messages on the Google-owned website.

Earlier this week Labour MP for Walthamstow Stella Creasy was the target of abusive messages on twitter threatening her with rape.

She was told on Twitter she would be tracked down and raped, with the terrifying threat: ‘Shall we meet near your house?’

More than 100,000 people have now signed a petition calling on Twitter to beef up its procedures for dealing with abuse.

The petition states: 'Abuse on Twitter is common, sadly too common. And it frequently goes ignored. We need Twitter to recognise that its current reporting system is below required standards.'

Miss Creasy was targeted because she had backed feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, who suffered similarly vile online messages - leading one alleged abuser to be arrested and bailed.

The MP has also been subjected to abusive messages on YouTube.

On Sunday Jack Riley, a car mechanic from Prestwich, Manchester, was arrested and taken to London for questioning over an offensive message he allegedly sent to Miss Criado-Perez after she backed plans to put Jane Austen on the new £10 note. The 21-year-old was later bailed.

A 25-year-old man was also held by Northumbria Police on suspicion of harassment in relation to abusive Twitter messages sent to Miss Creasy and Miss Criado-Perez. He was also later bailed.

Mr Clegg backed the police moving in to arrest people suspected of posting vile abuse online.

‘We shouldn’t blame the medium for what is totally unacceptable behaviour,’ he said at his monthly press conference.

‘I think it is right - really good 
actually’ that the police have sent out a signal by arresting these two 
characters – one in Manchester and one in Hull – for sending out these 
highly abusive and threatening tweets.

‘I
think it’s good the police have sent out this signal that just because 
you are tweeting you can’t suddenly behave in a way that you would never
behave if you were facing that person on the street.

'Just because you tweet something doesn’t
mean you can start behaving in a grotesque, offensive, abusive and 
sometimes criminal way'

‘I just think sometimes there’s a tendency to believe that just because it’s a new medium you can behave in a different way – well no you can’t.

‘Civilised, grown up appropriate behaviour should be respect by people whatever medium they use.’

Twitter has come under growing pressure to act against people who use the site to issue threats to other users, with calls for a button to make it easier to report offensive messages.

But the row wideneded with the revelation that similar threats have been posted on YouTube.

Many of the expletive-filled messages have remained on the site's comments section, posted under videos featuring senior female politicians, for as long as two years despite YouTube claiming that it does not tolerate harassment or threatening comments.

In one of the most shocking posts targeting Ms May, YouTube user Bufon63 adds: 'May, die and painfully. The world will be a better place.'

A torrent of abuse posted under a video of Maria Miller MP describes her as being 'evil personified'.

Shadow Culture Secretary Harriet Harman is also targeted on the website with one post four months ago reading: 'Exterminate the whore.'

Abuse: International Development Secretary Justine Greening has faced vile online messages

The latest revelations of online abuse aimed at female MPs comes after several politicians were targeted by trolls on Twitter.

Miss Creasy was the target of abusive messages on Twitter threatening her with rape. The MP has also been subjected to abusive messages on YouTube.

Miss Criado-Perez, 29, said Twitter 
needed to 'get a grip' on security and that the social network was 
ill-equipped to handle episodes of sustained abuse and needed to work 
more closely with police to deal with internet trolls.

Miss Criado-Perez met Twitter directors on Monday night along with Miss Creasy.

'This will have been a wake-up call for Twitter,' Miss Criado-Perez said. 'It will hopefully have led them to realise that they are not equipped to deal with this kind of thing properly. They need to get a grip and figure it out.'

A second MP, Claire Perry, received death threats relating to her fight against pornography on the internet.

Television
historian Mary Beard was also targeted by trolls, but received a 
grovelling apology from one after she publicised his abusive tweet and 
other Twitter users threatened to inform his family.

Oliver Rawlings, 20, branded Cambridge classicist Mary Beard a ‘filthy old slut’, and added a revolting sexual comment.

Professor
Beard, who silenced Rawlings by naming and shaming him as a Twitter 
troll, offered to take the student ‘out for a drink and smack his 
bottom’.

Rawlings used his own Twitter account
to send abuse to Professor Beard while she was speaking to Jeremy Vine 
on BBC Radio 2 on Monday, about how she had been victimised by trolls.

After
she forwarded his attack to her 42,000 followers – one of whom offered 
to send her his mother’s postal address – Rawlings wrote: ‘I sincerely 
apologise for my trolling.

His aunt Joy Rawlings told the Daily Mail that his Twitter misdemeanours were 'totally out of character'.

'This will have been a wake-up call for Twitter. It will hopefully have led them to realise that they are not equipped to deal with this kind of thing properly'

The
row prompted chairman of the culture select committee John Whittingdale
to say that Twitter bosses would be asked to give evidence to 
Parliament.

He said 
yesterday: 'I would have thought it very possible that the committee 
might want, in the course of our inquiry, to talk to Twitter.'

Del
Harvey, Twitter’s director for trust and safety, admitted it was not 
the company’s policy to automatically report threatening or abusive 
messages to police.

The 
website does not hold information to reveal the location a message has 
been sent from and therefore can not identify the correct local police 
force, Ms Harvey said.

She also revealed she had received 
messages threatening to rape her on 'multiple platforms across multiple 
sites on the internet' but chose not to prosecute.

Ms Harvey told BBC Radio Five Live: 'We don’t have that much information about our users compared with other platforms. We don’t always have that information about where the message came from.

'If somebody called you and said, "I’m going to come over and beat you up", you don’t expect the phone company to contact the police. You certainly expect them to work with police.'

A spokesman for YouTube told MailOnline that the website has various safeguards in place to try and protect users and members of the public from abuse and harassment.

He said: Comments and feedback are a valuable part of YouTube and we’re always disturbed when a minority try to spoil the experience for others. Harassment and threats are not tolerated on YouTube.

'If users come across a threatening comment, they can contact us through an easy-to-use tool.

'A staff of specialists monitors the reports from the tool 24/7 and takes action to remove and, when appropriate, report threatening comments to the authorities.

'Users can decide how they want to manage comments on their videos. They can allow comments, moderate them, or disable them.'

Hundreds of internet trolls were prosecuted last year, it was revealed yesterday.

The Crown Prosecution Service said it had brought more than 1,700 cases to court involving abuse sent online or  by mobile phone text message in 2012, up 10 per cent on the year before.

A further 600 charges have already been brought against internet and text bullies in the first five months of this year.
