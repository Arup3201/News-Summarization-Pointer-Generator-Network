Surrey County Council chief executive David McNulty defended his £215,000-a-year salary because of his job's 'tough responsibilities'

A council chief has defended his £215,000-a-year taxpayer-funded salary because of his job’s tough ‘responsibilities’.

Surrey County Council chief executive David McNulty told workers he could justify being paid £70,000 more than the Prime Minister because of the work that comes with his role, such as waste disposal and keeping the county’s buses running on time.

According to an internal document seen by MailOnline, Mr McNulty’s huge pay was called into question by one of his own workers during an online ‘ask me anything’ session in November.

A council worker, using the name Coraline, asked the chief executive: ‘Dear Mr McNulty, why, in a time of cuts, are we paying some staff posts, including yours, more than the Prime Minister gets paid?’

David Cameron is paid £142,000 a year.

Mr McNulty replied: ‘Hello Coraline. I do get paid a lot of money. The council uses external advice and benchmarking to set this salary.

‘The reason the council sets it at this level is because of the responsibilities involved. 

‘These include a budget of £1.7bn providing services to 1.1m residents.’

Council workers reacted with fury to Mr McNulty’s defence of his pay.

One enraged Surrey County Council worker, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘I find the chief executive’s salary laughable. Justifying his wages due to the amount of public he serves and budget he is accountable for is not comparable to David Cameron.

‘Our PM has the interest of 65million people and a multi-billion pound budget serving and protecting this country’s welfare and security.

‘In these times of austerity Mr McNulty has kicked off another initiative of asking Surrey to recycle one extra plastic bottle per week which will save £200K per year.

‘I can think of a quicker way for Surrey to meet its target and that's not by throwing away one bottle of Evian.’

A council worker asked Mr McNulty how he could defend being paid tens of thousands of pounds more than Prime Minister David Cameron

As well as his huge salary, Mr McNulty is in line for a one-off £100,000 bonus if he meets ‘performance-related targets’ by 2018.

Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: ‘A council chief executive certainly has some important responsibilities, but it's no surprise that residents in Surrey wonder if they quite equate to those of the Prime Minister.

‘Big pay packets and perks for the top brass are especially questionable when there has been pay freezes and even cuts across the rest of the public sector. Senior salaries have to be brought under control, so that councils can focus resources on frontline services.’

Earlier this year MPs challenged the leader of Surrey County Council, David Hodge, to justify 60 per cent pay rises for councillors and senior members of the council while opposing legislation that would have upped poorest-paid workers to a £7.65 an hour wage.

Labour MP Simon Danczuk asked Mr Hodge: ‘Why would you oppose giving the poorest paid workers a living wage and yet increase your own salary by 60 per cent and give a load of cash to the chief officers?’

At the time, Mr Hodge said lower paid staff had seen their wages increase.

A council spokesman said: ‘This response did not seek to compare the two salaries but rather pointed out that the role had been assessed independently from the Chief Executive based on the fact that he has responsibility for a budget of £1.7bn, has guided the county council to achieving savings of £260m in the past four years and is now steering it to a further £250m savings over the next five years.’
