A Canadan Trader Joe's enthusiast has spent more than $350,000 buying food at the popular U.S. grocery chain and selling it for a small fortune across the border.

Michael Hallatt fills his panel van with thousands of dollars of shopping each week then drives it all back to his Vancouver store where he charges $4.99 Canadian dollars for milk chocolate-covered potato chips that go for $2.99 US and $5.99 Canadian for a gluten free granola bar that sells for $3.49 US.

But the profitable business venture is now the subject of a law suit, as Trader Joe's strives to shut down the shop aptly called 'Pirate Joe's.'

'I'm their best customer,' Hallatt told Sfgate.com.

The law suit in May by the California-based supermarket chain, which has no presence in Canada.

It
claims the man has infringed a federal trademark. It also alleges 
unfair competition, false endorsement and false designation of origin; 
false advertising; federal trademark dilution; injury to business and 
reputation; and deceptive business practices.

But
Hallatt will not be detered and despite more and more stores posting 
his photograph on their windows his cross-border shopping trips 
continue. However, a sign on the sidewalk proclaims: 'Unauthorized. 
Unaffiliated. Unafraid.'

'Almost all the stores in the Pacific Northwest have asked me to leave,' the 53-year-old said.'This is a little bit David versus Goliath and a little bit Occupy Grocery.'

His lawyers in Seattle filed a motion to dismiss the case earlier this month.

Hallatt first became a Trader Joe's fan when he was living in the Bay Area in 1996. He opened his store in 2012 and his customers love it.

But he told Sfgate he barely gets by what with the cost of gas, goods, duty, rent and salaries. He offers 1,000 products and does not carry fresh or frozen foods.

According to the news website, Trader Joe's has obtained a Canadian trademark.

Hallatt usually spends $4,000 to $5,000 in cash a week and previously frequented Bellingham, Washington, but now drives further south to Seattle, Portland and even California.

He will go to any lengths to get his groceries, one time even cross dressing in a leopard muumuu, earrings and flowered flip-flops but someone called the police.

'My nail polish was not even dry when three cops showed up,' Hallatt recalled.

Experts claim Trader Joe's doesn't have a strong case suing a Canadian business from the US, particularly as they're making money out of him.

'(And) on the flip side, Trader Joe's is certainly benefiting from Hallatt purchasing the products,' lawyer Greg Owen told Sfgate.com. 'They're making money off him.'
