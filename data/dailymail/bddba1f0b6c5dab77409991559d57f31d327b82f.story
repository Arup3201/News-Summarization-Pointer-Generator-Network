Actress Samantha Morton is being urged by police to officially complain about the sexual abuse she endured in a children’s home as a teenager.

Detectives spoke to the Bafta and Golden Globe winner twice last week but say she did not ask them to take the matter further.

The 37-year-old actress revealed in a newspaper interview yesterday that she was abused by two residential care workers who came into her bedroom at night.

It happened at the Red Tile Home near Nottingham when she was 13. Some time afterwards she recalled being taken by her mother to a police station to report it.

After making a statement at Oxclose Lane police station in Nottingham she was placed in another home. No further action was taken and the men stayed in their jobs.

But Nottingham Police said yesterday they had checked their files and found no record of her complaint. And they said it was made clear to Ms Morton last week that detectives could not launch an investigation without her blessing.

‘But she has not, during either of those conversations, confirmed to us that she does wish to take this matter further,’ said the force in a statement. Police tried to call her again on Friday night and left a message ‘inviting her once again to make arrangements to speak to us’. The statement added that her allegations had to be made formally ‘not only to help Ms Morton obtain justice but also to assist others who may have been victims and to protect children who may still possibly be at risk’.

Her parents separated when she was two – her father was violent and her mother had a breakdown – and she went on to spend much of her childhood in foster and children’s homes.

Aged 11, she was moved permanently into the council-run Red Tiles, in Bulwell, four miles north of Nottingham.

‘I was very innocent and went to church. People called me a Bible-basher,’ she told The Guardian. The home was small, with just nine children. She recalled being singled out for preferential treatment by her abusers, who made her feel special.

‘I thought they were really nice, so I was really shocked when it happened. And, ultimately, nobody would have believed me, because they’re the coolest, nicest people.’

At first, they abused her individually. Then they both entered her bedroom at night and assaulted her.

The former Band of Gold actress said: ‘It’s a shock when someone does things to you, things you’re not expecting. It isn’t that people suddenly become the bogeymen. Abuse of children is gradual, this is why we now understand the term grooming.’

Not wishing to get the men ‘into trouble’ she didn’t report the abuse immediately, but eventually went to social workers ‘who did nothing’.

She said ‘there was no support, no offer of counselling, no wanting to delve deeper. A lot of people who abused my friends were people in very, very top jobs within the social services. Nottingham was rife with that then.’

The actress said she was speaking out following a report that detailed the sexual abuse of 1,400 children in Rotherham over 16 years and the ‘blatant’ collective failures to deal with the issue. The actress called for investigations to be launched in other towns and cities.

Police are investigating claims of historic abuse at nine care homes across Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, but have not received any allegations in relation to Red Tiles, which is now closed.

Steve Edwards, of Nottinghamshire social services, said: ‘We applaud Samantha for coming forward and talking about her time in the care system. We would welcome the chance to meet her so that we can discuss her concerns and progress our investigation further.’

Last night Ms Morton appeared to be completely at odds with Nottinghamshire Police over the complaint. Her spokeswoman insisted the actress was told last week by Superintendent Helen Chamberlain that ‘there was a historic police record of a complaint’ to the police.

‘Ms Chamberlain, who was most helpful, took a verbal statement from Samantha, who is now away filming, and it was agreed that this was an ongoing communication,’ she said. ‘Ms Morton is more than happy to co-operate with Nottinghamshire Police and social services in whatever way she can.’
