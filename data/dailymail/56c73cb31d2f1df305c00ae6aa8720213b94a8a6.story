A chilling image has surfaced which claims to show the ghost of a young drowning victim.

The spine-tingling photograph was posted on Facebook by Australian Kim Davison, but things began to get really spooky when it was revealed that a little girl died in the same spot 100 years ago.

Ms Davison, from Queensland, posted the image, which was taken in 2014, on the 'Toowoomba Ghost Chasers' Facebook page. It appears to show two women and four children swimming.

However Ms Davison and Jessie Lu, the other adult in the photo, are adamant they were with only three children when the photo was taken at Murphy's Hole in Lockyer River, south-east Queensland.

Social media users are claiming that the white shape at the back of the image, circled, shows a ghostly face

Photo was taken at Murphy's Hole which is the same location 13-year-old Doreen O'Sullivan drowned in 1915

Was it Doreen O'Sullivan' ghost? Ms Davison claims her daughter's leg was grabbed by something in the water

When examining the photo later, they were all shocked to see a fourth face in the background.

The face that can be seen appears to be very white with dark eyes and two shapes on either side of its head. 

'At the time of taking this photo there was nothing between us,' Ms Davison insists.

'I'm holding the little girl and that white head next to me with horns is not human, I can promise you that,' Ms Davison said.

'Its fingers are on my shoulder and on my daughter's arm. They are long skeletal type fingers.' 

The story became even spookier when researchers uncovered the story of Doreen O'Sullivan, a 13-year-old girl who drowned in the same creek in 1913. 

On the Facebook page, some commenters called these shapes 'horns', whilst others claimed to see two buns or two pony tails. 

A Brisbane Courier newspaper clipping from November 22 1913 has a death notice for a little girl who died in that watering hole. 

'Doreen O Sullivan, aged 13 years, eldest daughter of Mr. James O'Sullivan was accidentally drowned whilst bathing in the Lockyer Creek on Friday afternoon,' the notice reads.

'Nearly an hour elapsed, before the body was recovered. The spot, which has always been considered dangerous, is known as Murphy's Hole, and is over 20 foot deep.

An admin from the Toowoomba Ghost Chasers Facebook page posted a negative version of the image, saying: 'Light flare will always show up as black shadowing when the photo is inverted.. and in this case the light flare is coming from full sunlight reflecting off the water onto the child'

Tragic Doreen O'Sullivan was only 13 when she accidentally drowned in the swimming hole in 1915

 'The funeral took place on Saturday afternoon and was largely attended. The convent school children dressed in white, marching next to the hearse.' 

Disturbingly, Ms Davison claims that there had been strange occurrences that day as they swam in the water, which only firms her belief that a spirit was present. 

'On this day my daughter had her leg grabbed two times by something in the water.'

'When I went back in for one last dip to cool off I did feel something behind me as I was walking out of water but tried to ignore it. 

Ms Davison claims that two paranormal experts looked at the photograph and after extensive investigation came to the conclusion that the shape in the image is a child who drowned in the river in 1915.  

She is convinced that it Doreen O'Sullivan is 'an entity that exists in that spot in the creek'.

Some people commenting on the Facebook photo, including Ms Davison, claim there are multiple spirits captured in the photograph.

'There is a man with a beard near the girl I'm holding, near her feet. There are about four faces in the water. 

Ms Davison posted the photo on the Toowoomba Ghost Chasers Facebook page 

The administrators were shocked by the photo, writing 'We used to swim there all the time growing up and all I can say is just to be safe I'm never swimming there again!'

Ms Davison was also of the opinion that the figure in the photo was a demon who tried to take her daughter

A cynic responded to Ms Davison's claims, pointing out another possibility.

'The eye sees what it wants to see. In my opinion, it's nothing more than a splash of water,' wrote Max Meara. 

'Notice the child facing away from the camera - their left arm has just surfaced, causing a splash.'

Brad Glynn had another explanation: 'I think it is another kid just the sun is over exposed more on the face as they are facing the sun.'

The 'Toowoomba Ghost Chasers' Facebook page administrators were not convinced by either explanation.

'We used to swim there all the time growing up and all I can say is just to be safe I'm never swimming there again!' they wrote.
