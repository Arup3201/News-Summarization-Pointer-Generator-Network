Pandemonium broke out at a Houston mall overnight as police were forced to control hundreds of teenagers queuing for tickets to buy the new Air Jordans. 

Around 50 officers were called to Willowbrook Mall in northwest Houston, Texas, on Saturday night as the youngsters waiting began to push and shove each other while waiting in line.

At one point they surged forward and shattered one of the glass doors leading into the mall and also started throwing rocks in a bid to get in.

Chaos: Around 50 officers were called to Willowbrook Mall in northwest Houston on Saturday night as the youngsters waiting began to push and shove each other while waiting in line

Pandemonium: The crowds built up throughout Saturday night to get tickets to buy the new Air Jordans, which won't be on the shelves until next week 

As the chaos continued on Sunday morning, witnesses described how a 17-year-old girl was tasered as she waited.

The victim, who did not want to be named, told the ABC 13 she heard a 'firecracker' sound then a pulse move up her leg.

Speaking to station, witnesses said that it was a 'scare tactic' to get people to form an orderly queue and accused the police of an 'excessive' use of force.

Lt. Brady Fitzgerald with the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office confirmed that a taser had been used at 4am. He added that it will be reviewed. 

The mall decided not to let the customers in until Sunday. Those who were finally allowed to enter didn't even walk away with the sneakers as they were only given tickets to buy them when they are released next week.

The Air Jordan 11 Retro Legend Blue sneakers cost $200 and won't be on the shelves until next Saturday.

Shopper Katrice Stapleton described the scene to the station.

She said: 'I came out to get some shoes the 11's for my kids and so far it has been chaos. Complete chaos. They were throwing rocks trying to break the glass and get into the store. That happened about three times and they tried to bum-rush the court to get into the mall.' 

Queue: The shoppers were not allowed into the store on Saturday night. Staff finally opened the doors on Sunday but the pandemonium continued 

Chaos: Some members of the crowd threw rocks at the door of the mall in a bid to get it open early
