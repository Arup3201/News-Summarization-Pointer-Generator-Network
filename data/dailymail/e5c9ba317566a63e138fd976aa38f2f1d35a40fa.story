The world’s fastest mobility scooter has smashed the current record with a top speed of almost 108mph at a race in the UK.

David Anderson and Matthew Hine from Anderson’s Body Shop in Ballasalla on the Isle of Man custom built the vehicle in an attempt to break the top speed of 82mph.

Mr Hine was strapped into the seat as he raced around the track at the Pokerstars Drag and Drift at Jurby Motordrome on the island on Saturday.

In testing the pair had managed to reach a maximum speed of 107.3mph and were aiming for at least 108mph in the race – they said on Facebook ‘anything less would be a fail’.

Mr Hine, who built the scooter from scratch with his colleague, said: ‘It’s a 600 Bandit, slightly modified, split exhausts, tweaked carburetors shoehorned into a mobility scooter.

‘The frame was a cart chassis, shortened and lengthened to fit into the scale of a mobility scooter.’

Mr Anderson, who carried out the body work, said: ‘The body work is all aluminium and everything works on it as well such as the lights, indicators, brake lights – even the horn works.’

In tests the pair found the vehicle would reach speeds of 107mph but it topped it at 108mph during recent race

The pair are unable to register the scooter for road-use though, as they say it doesn’t have any front brakes.

After some minor modifications, including a change to the gearing, they were able to reach a maximum speed of 107.6mph - smashing the current official record held by Klaus Petersen from Denmark.

‘It’s an unofficial new world record – we just have to wait for Guinness to confirm everything for us,’ said Mr Anderson. 

At the start line, Mr Hine took it for three  test runs before reaching 108mph - a speed they were happy with

The pair said on their Facebook that anything less than 108mph for them would have been 'a fail'

The moments they reached the record-breaking speed were captured on a camera strapped to driver Mr Hine

They are waiting for confirmation from Guinness World Records to say they hold the new official world record
