A family has been left without power after they received a surprise electricity bill for £64,000.

Terry and Tracey Rust and their three children are living by candlelight as they claim they cannot afford to pay the massive bill for power at their farmhouse.

The couple have been landed with the bill after they made a mistake when giving the power supplier details of their meter.

When asked for the serial number of the main meter that serves their farm, Mr Rust gave the details of a prepayment meter that is only for part of the property.

After the power company npower realised the mistake the sent Mr Rust a bill for the electricity. When he failed to pay it successfully applied for a warrant to cut off his power.

Mrs Rust, 38, who lives with her husband and children aged 16, 14 and 12 at their poultry farm in North Benfleet, Essex, said: ‘I can’t do washing and we can’t have a bath - you just wouldn’t think this sort of thing would happen in England.

‘I am sick of crying and want to get back to normal, but there is no possible way in this world we can raise £61,000.’

Mr Rust, 61, said: ‘I’ve lived here for 40 years without a problem but now npower have made me feel like a criminal.

‘When they came to cut off our meter even the people they sent were shocked they could do this to a family with children.

‘My family is suffering because call centre staff confused our meters and messed up our billing.

‘We’re having to live by candle light which is madness in the 21st century.

‘I’ve offered a good will gesture of £10,000 and then monthly payments of £5,000 on top of that but they turned it down.’

Last
night power supplier npower said that Mr Rust did not pay anything 
towards the energy use at his farm - which includes a large farmhouse, 
stables, commercial units, poultry farm, equestrian centre and caravan 
park - for over three years.

A spokesman said: ‘Mr Rust called us in December 2008 to give us the serial number of the main meter for his house.

‘However,
instead he gave us details for a prepayment meter which only supplies 
one unit on his property. The main meter supplies his house, stables, 
two mobile home sites and an office. We updated his account to reflect 
the information he gave us.

‘When we discovered that this information was incorrect in 2010, we corrected his details and the account stood at £16,000. Mr Rust did not pay anything towards his energy use between July 2009 - October 2012.

‘He made three payments after October but since then, we have received sporadic payments. The account currently stands at £61,000.

‘We have been trying to resolve the situation with Mr Rust but he has given us conflicting VAT declarations confirming if the property is for domestic or commercial use.’

He added: ‘We are absolutely not at fault here.’
