A mother of six who had to leave a £4,000-a-month townhouse in Belgravia when housing benefit rules changed is fighting to be rehoused in the exclusive area.

Stephanie Demouh and her children had lived for around three years in a £2million four-bedroom house near Sloane Square.

The estimated £1,200-a-week rent for the three-storey home – which has a garage in an area where a parking space can change hands for more than £100,000 – is believed to have been covered almost entirely by housing benefit.

Lavish living: Belgravia is one of the capital's most exclusive neighbourhoods where properties cost more than £6million

But new rules limiting the benefit to
£400 a week, designed to stop taxpayers’ money being spent on houses in
the most expensive areas, meant that in December she had to move 
somewhere cheaper.

The 38-year-old accountancy student demanded £40,000 
from Westminster city council to help with housing costs and is believed
to have been given £10,000.

She found temporary accommodation in Edgware, North London, an easy 
ten-mile commute from Belgravia. But Miss Demouh is still not happy and 
has appealed to Westminster council to find and fund another home in 
Belgravia where the average house costs more than £3million.

She is married to businessman Djiwonou Djogbessi, 38, and has a 50 per 
cent share in his online fashion business, but told The Sunday Times 
that while he ‘helps a lot’, she does not live with him.

After failing in a High Court attempt to keep her housing benefit claim 
secret, she told the newspaper that she needed to be housed in Belgravia
at public expense so that her children can continue to attend their 
top-rated state primary school, and she can continue her course at 
Westminster University.

She claimed she was having to travel for two hours on the bus with her 
children to and from school.

They do not take the Tube, although it is 
often quicker.

Her children are understood to be aged between one and ten. Four attend 
the primary school in Belgravia with a fifth set to start there in 
September.

Miss Demouh, who is British, but was born in Togo, West Africa, said: 
‘My children are suffering because they are overtired all the time. They
can’t do their homework, they fall asleep on their way home.

‘When they get home they can’t eat their dinner because they are too 
tired. The youngest are getting sick the whole time. I am saying the 
primary school is a very good school – it is close to private 
education.’

Relocated: Stephanie Demouh was forced to move out of a £2million house near Sloane Square

Asked why she was complaining about the ten-mile commute when others, 
many of whom do not qualify for housing benefit, travel further every 
day, Miss Demouh said: ‘I don’t have a problem with where I live other 
than the location.

‘It is just the long distance from the children’s school, and I can’t 
change my place of study. If you have to attend a nine o’clock lecture, 
you can’t be at both places together.’

Miss Demouh said she and her children had been on a six-week holiday to 
Togo last year, but said a cousin paid for the air fares.

Her husband joined them halfway through the holiday she said, but 
stressed that he did not live with  her. Housing benefit payouts are  
less likely if a wage-earning husband is living in the same house as a 
mother.

Miss Demouh claimed her temporary accommodation in Edgware was more 
expensive than the Belgravia townhouse and added: ‘I don’t think I have 
committed a crime by trying to protect my family.’

A former neighbour of Miss Demouh in Belgravia told the Daily Mail he 
was disgusted by her quest for more public money to be spent on 
rehousing her there, saying: ‘It’s entirely unfair and completely 
ludicrous.

‘Why should I save up and work hard all my life to own a property that 
I’m proud of when she can just come and live here for free?’

Westminster city council cabinet minister for housing, Jonathan Glanz, 
said last night that Miss Demouh’s case was being investigated by its 
fraud team.

He said: ‘This investigation is ongoing, so we cannot comment on the 
specific details. Westminster city council are committed to ensuring 
that homes and taxpayers’ money are used to help only those in genuine 
need and will not tolerate people “playing the system” to their own 
benefit.’
