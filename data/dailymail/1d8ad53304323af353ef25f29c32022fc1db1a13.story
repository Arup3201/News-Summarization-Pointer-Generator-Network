This is the moment a crash victim was dragged from the flaming wreck of his car through the sunroof after a 3am car-crash.

The man, who has not been named, was plucked from the burning vehicle after it hit a guard rail and flipped over on Sunday morning.

Three people who stopped to help heard the man screaming inside the car, which caught on fire after landing wheels-up on the Powhite Parkway, a toll road near Richmond, Virginia.

Burning: The man was pulled from the flaming wreckage of his car, which crashed near Richmond, Virginia

Freed: A passerby, who had a hammer in his car, was able to smash in the sunroof and pluck him to safety

One man - Aaron Parks - got a hammer from his car and was able to smash in the sunroof, through which the trio dragged the man out, WTVR reported. 

Moments after he was pulled to safety, there was an explosion in the wreckage and the flames burned even more strongly.

After the rescue, Parks said: 'I was lucky enough to have the hammer... The flames were intense. He didn’t have 15 more seconds to spare.'

Another rescuer, Devon Farmer, said: 'He’s a lucky guy. I don’t know if he honestly would have made it [without the rescue].'

The man was taken to a nearby medical center, where doctors ruled that he was not seriously hurt.

Nick of time: Not long after the screaming man was freed, there was an explosion in the car and the flames intensified

Scene: The car crash happened on the Powhite Parkway, a toll road a few miles outside of Richmond
