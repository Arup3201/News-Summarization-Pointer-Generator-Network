An Indianapolis jail let an inmate out by mistake last week - the sixth time such an error has occurred since June.

It took Marion County deputies three days to locate and rearrest Scott Snyder, 31, who was in jail for assault with a deadly weapon.

In June, deputies had to track down five inmates who had been released by accident.

Fox 59 reports that the problems began when the county switched over to a new computer system called Odyssey in June.

A spokesperson said the latest mistaken release was down to the system and human error.

According to the IndyStar, the error occurred when a release order was logged on Snyder's case file but the jail staff didn't check a second case file number for the prisoner, which said Snyder should be held in custody.

Snyder was released Monday and back in custody Thursday.

'They’re human beings and there can be human errors, it’s not a totally electronic system and even with the information that they have it’s extremely complicated,' said Lieutenant Colonel Louis Dezelan.

Following the earlier incident, he said the sheriff's department would go 'above and beyond' to ensure it didn't happen again.

Sheriff John Layton, a Democrat, was just named Indiana Sheriff of the Year and will run against Republican Emmitt Carney in November.

Carney says Layton should bear the blame for the mistakes.

'They can say it’s on the computer, they can say it’s operator error, bottom line it comes down to him. It’s his office, it’s his shop. When is somebody going to step up and accept responsibility,' Carney told Fox59.
