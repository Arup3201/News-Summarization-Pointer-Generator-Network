Roy Hodgson dismissed the failure of any Premier League club to reach the Champions League quarter finals this season by saying; 'It's a fact of life, these things happen some times'. 

The England manager spoke at a press conference on Thursday after announcing his squad ahead of this month's Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania and friendly with Italy  - with a debut call for Tottenham striker Harry Kane being the most notable inclusion.

The Three Lions boss was asked if he was concerned that no English team has reached the last eight of Europe's elite competition for the second time in three years - putting pressure on the number of places they will be granted in the future.

Hodgson said that the current problem was 'not endemic' but simply 'these things happen sometimes'

'The Premier League won't want to lose their fourth spot in the competition and the clubs won't want that because the Champions League is a major target for them when they start the season.

'Unfortunately, its a fact of life that if you want your four places, you need to get the points to keep your status high.

'I don't think it's endemic that we've had teams going out.

'Manchester City came up against Barcelona. Arsenal were fantastic in their second game against Monaco but weren't able to turn it around. Chelsea and PSG were unbelievably close in the two games - nobody would have complained should Chelsea have gone through instead of PSG.

Arsenal fought bravely in return leg against Monaco but paid the price for a poor home tie

'Its a fact of live, these things happen sometimes. There will be other times when all four teams get through and we'l be saying we were a bit lucky because the opponents were just as good.

'Its a very high standard of football. I feel sorry for the mangers going into these games because we can underestimate the quality of teams in these other leagues and there's no God given  right to get through.

'The Premier League is is a great league, we have great teams and great players but that doesn't give us a right to win against other teams from other countries.

'Unfortunately, we've experienced that once again to our cost.'
