A man claims he was forced to leave his home after taunts from youths who called him Hitler and did Nazi salutes at him.

Derek Morris says he was targeted by a 20-strong group who shouted 'Sieg Heil' at him and left his wife frightened to go outside.

The couple, of Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, called the police more than 70 times but say they were eventually forced to move. 

Move: Security guard Derek Morris and his wife Carol were driven of their home and forced to move

Security guard Derek, 55, and his wife Carol, 50, ended up selling their home and moving into a rented property.

They told the Mirror the sale lost them Â£20,000 but they felt they didn't have any other option.

Derek said: 'They would kick the ball off the wall, the front door, sit on our window sill, lie on my car.'

They have both been treated for depression after the incidents and tried to film the youngsters but that lead to them being called 'paedophiles'.

Carol said she would turn all the lights off in the house to make it look empty and Derek said he was told if he was Jewish police would have treated the incidents as hate crimes.

Inspector Mike O'Hagan, of Cumbria Police, said police had tried to solve the problems but the couple say the force did not do enough to help them. 

In November, MailOnline reported on neighbours from hell in Tyne and Wear who were making people's lives a misery.

Police burst in to a 
series of homes in the early hours to deliver final
 warnings or eviction notices.

Crimes linked to the 
properties included drunk and disorderly, theft, criminal damage, breach
 of the peace, drug offences, threatening behaviour, intimidation, noise
 nuisance and shoplifting.
