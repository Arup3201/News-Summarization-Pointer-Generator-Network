Parents should cut back on the amount of sugar their children consume by giving them yoghurt instead of ice cream, according to a new Government campaign.

Change4Life, launched today by Public Health England, is promoting 'sugar swap' tips as part of a push to cut back on the amount of sugar being consumed by young Britons on a daily basis.

It comes as a survey found that two-thirds of parents are worried about the amount of sugar in their children’s diets, while nearly half believe that their family consumes too much sugar.

According to Department of Health guidelines, added sugars should make up just one tenth of a person's calorie intake.

But statistics show that younger children, particularly those aged between four and 10, are consuming up to 50 per cent more than this.  

The Change4Life campaign will offer parents a 'sugar challenge', suggesting food which can be substituted for sugary products.

Examples include giving a child water or milk instead of soft drinks, or a wholewheat biscuit cereal rather than a sugary cereal at breakfast. 

Professor Kevin Fenton, national director of health and well-being at PHE said the impact on our health of eating too much sugar is evident.

He said: 'Reducing sugar intake is important for the health of our children both now and in the future.

'We are all eating too much sugar and the impact this has on our health is evident. This campaign is about taking small steps to address this.

17 per cent from soft drinks

17 per cent from biscuits, buns, cakes, pastries and fruit pies

14 per cent from confectionery

13 per cent from fruit juice

8 per cent from breakfast cereal 

'We know from past campaigns that making simple swaps works and makes a real difference.'  

Research from the University of Reading found that the average sugar intake of 50 families went down by 40 per cent when they followed the Change4Life advice.

In one month, the average dropped from 483g to 287g - the equivalent of 49 sugar cubes per day.  

Dr Daniel Lamport, Research Fellow at the University of Reading and Challenge data collection coordinator, comments: 'It is fantastic to see that the sugar swaps resulted in a reduction in sugar intake for these families.

'The University of Reading is delighted to support preventative health campaigns such as this which can help make a real difference to the health of the nation.'

Earlier this year, the Government's own scientific advisers called for the target for added sugar to be reduced by half to 5 per cent of a person's daily intake. 

Excess sugar intake has become a key focus for health researchers and campaigners after it emerged that it causes at least as much damage as vices such as salt.

A study last month claimed that sugar is likely to be a more significant factor in pushing up blood pressure than salt.

But the findings were challenged by other experts who said a direct link between sugar and hypertension had not yet been proven. 

Sugar has nonetheless been identified as a key cause of obesity and associated diseases later in life such as heart problems, cancer and type two diabetes. It is also impacting dental health.  

Eating and drinking too much sugar means extra calories, which causes fat to build up inside the body. This can lead to heart disease, some cancers or type 2 diabetes later in life. 

Four sugar swaps recommended by Change4Life:

The breakfast swap: Swap sugary cereal for plain cereal, such as a wholewheat biscuit cereal

The drink swap: Swap from sugary drinks to sugar-free or no-added-sugar drinks

The after school swap: Swap, for example, a muffin to a fruited teacake

The pudding swap: Swap, for example, from ice cream to low-fat lower-sugar yoghurt

Children who are overweight or obese when they are young are far more likely to become overweight or obese adults.

Recently published data highlights that approximately 1 in 5 children aged 4 to 5 years old and 1 in 3 children aged 10 to 11 years old is overweight or obese.   

Cathy Court, founder of Netmums said: 'We know that mums want to provide a healthy diet for their children but balancing a number of competing priorities, including healthy eating, can be tricky.

'This research with Netmums showed that sugar consumption is a worry for parents but taking steps to reduce sugar can be really difficult.

'We hope that these simple sugar swaps from Change4Life will make it easier for parents to reduce their family's sugar intake.  

The Change4Life campaign will feature media advertising as well as a national roadshow and the delivery of sugar swap packs to parents. 

Meanwhile, almost two-thirds of people do not know how many calories the average person needs to maintain a healthy weight, according to separate research commissioned by Diabetes UK, The British Heart Foundation and Tesco.

A YouGov survey of 2,025 people, commissioned to mark the launch of a new partnership between the three organisations that aims to improve the health of the nation, found that just 35% of respondents knew the average man needs to consume 2,500 calories a day to maintain a healthy weight.

Only slightly more, 37%, could pinpoint 2,000 calories as the equivalent for women.
