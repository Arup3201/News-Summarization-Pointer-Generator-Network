Liverpool star Raheem Sterling took to Instagram to share another photo from his holiday.

The 20-year-old flew to Jamaica after the Reds drew 2-2 with Leicester on New Year's Day, and was also absent from Liverpool's 2-1 win over AFC Wimbledon in the FA Cup third round on Monday.

But he is set to return to action against Sunderland in the Premier League on Saturday lunchtime.

Reds boss Brendan Rodgers promised Sterling a break at some point over the festive period to ensure he can last the season.

Sterling's importance to Liverpool has risen this season after the departure of Luis Suarez in the summer and the injury to Daniel Sturridge that has kept him out since August.

The 20-year-old has been deployed as a striker by Rodgers in recent weeks, and scored twice at Bournemouth as well as netting the winner at Burnley.
