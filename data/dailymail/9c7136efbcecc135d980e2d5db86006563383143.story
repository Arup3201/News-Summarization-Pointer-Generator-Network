Eden Hazard has described Chelsea team-mate Cesc Fabregas as a 'footballing brain' and admitted it took the duo just one training session to get on the same wavelength.

Fabregas has proved a revelation at Stamford Bridge since his arrival in the summer, grabbing 15 assists in his side's march to the top of the table.

He is the first player in Premier League history to create 15 goals in two different seasons having achieved it previously with Arsenal.

The Spaniard has also built a formidable relationship with Hazard, who himself has been involved in 12 goals this season, and the Belgian admitted it didn't take long for them to hit it off on the pitch.

'With Cesc, you don't need to work for years together, we just needed one game, one training session and we knew each other,' explained Hazard in Chelsea magazine.

'It's a pleasure to play with him because he knows everything about football. He's a brain – you can see that because he has 15 assists in the league already, in January.

'He's very good and he has the same vision as me, so I like playing with him.'
