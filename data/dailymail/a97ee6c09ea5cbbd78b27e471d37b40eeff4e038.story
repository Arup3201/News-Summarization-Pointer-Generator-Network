Caroline Wozniacki has thanked fans for their 'sweet messages' following her split from Rory McIlroy and claimed she'll 'never walk alone' in reference to her favourite football club Liverpool.

The pair's engagement was called off on Wednesday with the major winner and former world No 1 confirming the relationship had ended after he realised he was not ready for marriage.

Woznaicki took to Twitter on Thursday morning to thanks fans for their support following the break up and said: 'It's a hard time for me right now. Thanks for all the sweet messages! Happy I support Liverpool right now because I know I'll never walk alone.'

Long-term: The 25-year-old had been with his ex-fiancee for more than two years and proposed in December

Support: Wozniacki is a big Liverpool supporter and claimed she'll 'Never Walk Alone'

McIlroy, 
who made the announcement publicly after speaking to Wozniacki, said on 
Wednesday: 'There is no right way to end a relationship that has been so
 important to two people.

'The problem is mine,' he said.

'The wedding invitations issued at the weekend made me realise that I wasn't ready for all that marriage entails.

'I
 wish Caroline all the happiness she deserves and thank her for the 
great times we've had. I will not be saying anything more about our 
relationship in any setting.'

The
 golden couple of sport enjoyed a short-lived engagement after 
announcing to their million plus Twitter followers last new year's eve 
that they were to marry.

At the time the pair posted matching pictures of themselves with a ring.

It
 is understood the couple - dubbed Wozzilroy in some circles after a 
golf wedge was engraved with the moniker - had been an item for more 
than two years.

It's not you: The golfer said the problem was all his and wished Wozniacki all the best for the future

All change then: McIlroy posted this tweet just last week which didn't indicate any problems
