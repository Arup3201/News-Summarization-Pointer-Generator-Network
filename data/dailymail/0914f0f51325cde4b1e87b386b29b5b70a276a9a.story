A police officer who persuaded a female suspect to perform oral sex on him while she was held in custody is today facing jail.

Detention officer Kyle Adams, 24, had the illicit encounter with the woman after she was detained at Bethnal Green Police Station in east London.

The woman, who is in her 20s, had been arrested on suspicion of burglary but was later cleared, Southwark Crown Court heard.

Detention officer Kyle Adams, 24, pictured left, has admitted one count of misconduct in a public office after convincing a drunk suspect to perform oral sex on him while she was in custody at Bethnal Green Police Station, pictured right, in east London

She was drunk during the incident, which took place in the station's custody area between October 1 and 3 last year, said prosecutor Georgina Nicholas.

Wearing a blue and white checked shirt and grey pinstriped trousers, Adams admitted a single count of misconduct in a judicial or public office.

He was due to stand trial today, having originally denied the offence.

Adams, who has a history of depression, resigned from the Metropolitan Police on the day of the incident.

Adjourning sentence for reports, Judge Michael Gledhill QC warned Adams that all options were open: 'I am not making any promises whatsoever about what is going to happen to you.

'Your counsel has rightly conceded this case is very serious and crosses the custody threshold.

'I believe before you even saw a legal advisor you were well aware of the seriousness of what you had done.'

Adams, from Barking, Essex, has been released on bail and will be sentenced on September 2. 

Guilty plea: Adams was warned at Southwark Crown Court, pictured, that he may face jail when he is sentenced in September
