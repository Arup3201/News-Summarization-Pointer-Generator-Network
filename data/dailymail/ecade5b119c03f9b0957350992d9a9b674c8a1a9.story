Souleymane S said that this was not the first time he had been abused because of the colour of his skin. Souleymane S, who stood on that Paris Metro platform facing down the morons and the bullies and their atavism and their hate.

Souleymane S, who stood with his hands by his sides, implacable and angry, defiant and unbowed, facing down the Chelsea mob on the train.

‘You know, I live with racism,’ Souleymane S told Le Parisien. ‘I was not really surprised by what happened to me, even if it was a first in the subway.’

Paul Nolan's footage went on to show passengers in the carriage following the disgraceful incident

He had never met the Chelsea fans before but Souleymane S recognised the ugly faces that stared out from that carriage at Richelieu-Drouot station on Tuesday evening.

He lives in a capital whose racial tensions were captured so starkly by the film La Haine 20 years ago, a capital which is newly familiar with heinous hate crimes. Souleymane S knew those faces and, sadly, so did we. Because racism, sometimes cunningly concealed, sometimes bold as brass, still haunts English football. Many are in denial about that. Many still seek to portray it as a fantasy perpetuated by the politically correct. Others blame the media for highlighting a problem that they say does not exist.

Most, including football’s governing bodies, don’t want to confront it. Not really. They say they do but when it comes to hard choices, they back off. They would prefer to talk about initiatives, T-shirts, TV adverts and catchy slogans. They deal in lip service.

I have had first-hand experience of that so I know how it goes. I know how difficult it can get when you seek to highlight even relatively trivial incidents.

Two years ago, England played a World Cup qualifier in San Marino and a few groups of fans sang a song about burning the Ferdinand brothers, Rio and Anton, on a bonfire. The song was sung against the backdrop of the racial abuse case that pitted the Ferdinands against former England captain John Terry. It was laden with meaning. I heard it, some of my Press colleagues heard it and some England fans among the vast majority who weren’t singing it, heard it, too.

I wrote about it. Others mentioned it. The FA responded by launching a half-hearted inquiry. They did not want their reputation sullied or a fine to be levied. They said they couldn’t find any evidence the song had been sung. I asked why witness accounts did not constitute evidence. They did not reply. They threw those of us who heard the chants under the bus.

In a way, that is why what happened in Paris on Tuesday feels, amid the disgust and shame, like an important step forward. It wasn’t a surprise to most observers of the English game. It wasn’t anything new. Except for one thing.

Except that what happened to Souleymane S is there on video and with audio. Paul Nolan, who shot the footage, performed a great service to English football. The plausible deniability that football exercised time after time, including in San Marino, is gone. This time, there is no denying it. This time, there is no sanitising it. This time, there is no hiding from it. Admitting that race is a real problem in English football again, admitting we have not made as much progress as we thought we had, is a critical first step.

Oh, we’ve made some advances, for sure. Fans do not throw bananas as they used to when Bradford City’s Ces Podd ran past in the Seventies.

But racial prejudice is on the rise in our society. Somehow, we have reached a point where our Jewish community is, once more, scared for its safety. Xenophobia, in different forms, seems to be multiplying.

Look at what happens when articulate men such as Jason Roberts or Stan Collymore speak out about race on Twitter: they are doused with foul abuse. It is time for football to start taking some bold steps. It is not enough to keep playing safe and hoping the problem goes away.

This should not be about isolating Chelsea who are in many ways a model of multi-culturalism, owned by a Russian Jew who appointed a Portuguese as manager and a Nigerian as technical director and whose employees have overseen a progressive Asian Star initiative.

Chelsea have acted swiftly and strongly. They have been unequivocal in their condemnation of what happened. Jose Mourinho said he was ‘ashamed’.

But this is not just about Chelsea. This has to go further than merely punishing the scum who repelled Souleymane S from that train and chanted how proud they were to be racist. Prison sentences, banning orders; that’s easy.

That just scratches the surface. These people are produced by our society, not by our football. There is no quick fix.

But there are ways forward; ways that will take courage and perseverance and brave leadership. It’s about time, for instance, that the Football League stood up and led the way by introducing a version of the NFL’s Rooney Rule for the lower leagues.

There is no point involving the Premier League yet. Most aspiring black coaches don’t have enough experience to manage in the top flight because they have been denied opportunities lower down the pyramid.

The idea that getting a job in English football is a meritocracy, and that would-be managers are not discriminated against because of their ethnicity, is a joke. More and more people accept it is a joke.

More and more people acknowledge it is a stain on our game that there are only four black managers in our league (four more than there were at the start of the season).

It is time for the FA and the Football League to accept that the balance needs to be redressed; that black aspiring managers should at least be given the chance to put their case when a managerial vacancy arises. They have delayed long enough. They must take steps to fix it and, in the process, send out a message to morons like the men on the Metro that we value diversity and the rule of talent in our game.

Enough of saying there is no problem. There is a problem. Enough of laissez-faire. Enough of thinking that English football will heal itself. It won’t. It needs help.

When new QPR boss Chris Ramsey, the only black manager in the Premier League, spoke on Thursday, he was asked if he had suffered racism in his career. ‘A lot,’ he said.

He didn’t elaborate but my guess is that part of what he was referring to were the job applications that went unanswered, the coaching qualifications that went unheeded.

‘Racism is not something that gets eradicated,’ said Ramsey. ‘It gets shuffled about and hidden in places you wouldn’t believe.’

When Souleymane S tried to get on that train, he did not give up. He was repelled and tried again. He kept pushing back.

English football needs to follow his example. It’s time to push back.

It’s time to stop pretending everything is OK.

Penalty decisions are not always clear-cut. What was Wayne Rooney supposed to do at Deepdale on Monday night when the Preston North End goalkeeper, Thorsten Stuckmann, came hurtling out of his goal, launched himself at the ball and missed? Was he supposed to take the hit and risk serious injury?

Was he supposed to hurdle the keeper, do everything he could to stay on his feet and accept that the scoring opportunity that should have been his was gone?

Or, having taken evasive action and stumbled when he landed, was he entitled to go down? Surely a forward should not be penalised because of a keeper’s rash challenge?

Rooney did nothing wrong. If the keeper throws himself at the ball and misses, impeding an attacker in the process, he has to take the consequences.

It is interesting that Britain’s Olympic 400m champion Christine Ohuruogu still feels entitled to criticise IAAF president Lamine Diack for suggesting there is a crisis in the sport, because of allegations made about officials covering up doping in Russia. Ohuruogu  should have taken a minute, remembered that she once missed three drug tests in succession and accepted that, when it comes to doping matters, her voice carries very, very little authority.
