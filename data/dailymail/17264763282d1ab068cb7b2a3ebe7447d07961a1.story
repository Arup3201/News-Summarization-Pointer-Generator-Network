Brave: Dr Maria Santos Gorrostieta has been found beaten to death at the side of a road. She defied Mexico's powerful drug gangs and survived two assassination attempts, the first of which claimed the life of her husband

The woman mayor who was kidnapped and murdered by a Mexican drug gang pleaded with her attackers for her young daughter’s life, it emerged today.

Maria Santos Gorrostieta, who had already survived two assassination attempts, was driving the child to school at around 8.30am when she was ambushed by a car in the city of Morelia.

The 36-year-old was hauled from her vehicle and physically assaulted as horrified witnesses watched, according to newspaper El Universal.They described how she begged for her child to be left alone and then appeared to get into her abductors’ car willingly.

The little girl was left wailing as her mother was driven away on Monday November 12.

For the next week, her frantic family waited by the phone for a ransom call that never came.  Gorrostieta’s body – stabbed, burned, battered and bound at wrist and ankle – would finally be found eight days on dumped by a roadside in San Juan Tararameo, Cuitzeo Township.

She left behind her daughter and two sons as well as her second husband Nereo Delgado Patinoran.

Hailed as a heroine of the 21st century, her death has prompted much soul-searching in a country ravaged by violence.

The decision to withdraw her security team in November last year – and her police escort in January – has come under particular scrutiny.Gorrostieta was elected as mayor of Tiquicheo, a rural district in Michoacan, west of Mexico City, in 2008.

Almost immediately, she received threats. The first assassination attempt came in October 2009 when the car she was travelling in with her first husband Jose Sanchez came under fire from gunmen in the town of El Limone. The attack claimed his life but Gorrostieta lived.

She battled back from her injuries in the face of overwhelming tragedy, but she was not destined to know peace.

The next attempt on her life was just three months later, when an masked group carrying assault rifles ambushed her on the road between Michoacan and Guerreo state. The van she was traveling in was peppered by 30 bullets. Three hit her.

This time her wounds were more severe, leaving multiple scars and forcing her to wear a colostomy bag. She was left in constant pain.

But with unimaginable courage – and despite being a marked woman – she remained defiant to the very end.

Murder: The corpse of Dr Gorrostieta, found by farm workers from San Juan Tararameo. She had been burned, beaten and stabbed

Scene of the crime: Cuitzeo Township, close to where her corpse was discovered and Morelia, where she was kidnapped

When some doubted that she had been shot, Gorrostieta bared the scars that riddled her flesh and swore she would never give in.

In a statement to the public made at the time, the devout Catholic said: 'At another stage in my life, perhaps I would have resigned from what I have, my position, my responsibilities as the leader of my Tiquicheo.

'But today, no. It is not possible for me to surrender when I have three children , whom I have to educate by setting an example, and also because of the memory of the man of my life, the father of my three little ones, the one who was able to teach me the value of things and to fight for them.

'Although he is no longer with us, he continues to be the light that guides my decisions.'

She added: 'I struggle day to day to erase from my mind the images of the horror I lived, and that others who did not deserve or expect it also suffered.

Grim discovery: Residents of the community of San Juan Tararameo found her body as they went to work in the fields

'I wanted to show them my wounded, mutilated, humiliated body, because I’m not ashamed of it, because it is the product of the great misfortunes that have scarred my life, that of my children and my family.'

'Despite my own safety and that of my family, what occupies my mind is my responsibility towards my people, the children, the women, the elderly and the men who break their souls every day without rest to find a piece of bread for their children.

'Freedom brings with it responsibilities and I don’t dare fall behind. My long road is not yet finished - the footprint that we leave behind in our country depends on the battle that we lose and the loyalty we put into it.'

After her ordeal she remarried and ran for a seat in Mexico's Congress of the Union, but failed to gain the backing she needed.

She remarried and dropped out of the public eye.

But it was still almost inevitable that she would eventually pay for her bravery with her life

Mexico has been torn apart by murderous drug gangs since President Felipe Calderon launched his drug offensive in 2006.

More than 50,000 people have been killed in clashes between rival drug cartels and security forces and about two dozen mayors have been murdered.

The cartels have ruled the streets with fear for years, enforcing their authority with murders, bribery and torture.

But after decades of using force to combat the gangs, it is U.S. lawmakers who are the criminals' biggest problem.

Legalisation of marijuana, as recently voted for by Colorado and Washington states, may wipe billions of dollars from the cartels’ annual profits.

And it has left politicians in Mexico with a tough question: How can they continue to justify spending money – and lives – fighting drug distribution to America when it will be legal in some states from next month?

Sickening: Dr Gorrostieta shows the wounds she sustained from the ambushers' gunfire and the subsequent car crash

Wounds: The ex-mayor was lucky to survive the second attack. She was left in constant pain and was forced to use a colostomy bag

Mexico presidential advisor Luis 
Videgaray said in a radio interview last week: 'Obviously, we can’t 
handle a product that is illegal in Mexico, trying to stop its transfer 
to the United States, when in the United States, at least in part of the
 United States, it now has a different status'

From January to September last year, 
12,903 people were killed in the country in drug-related crime, ranging 
from gang members, Mexican military and innocent victims caught up in 
gun battles.

The Mexican government claim they are winning the war on drugs, but few outside – or inside – the country believe that.

So corrupt are their police that they
 are rarely employed in combating the cartels. Instead, the country 
relies on its army to tackle the gangs while it attempts to rebuild its 
police forces.

Public support for the drug war continues to fall as the death toll rises and the cartels’ profits rise.

The business of trafficking drugs 
from Mexico into the U.S. is estimated to be a business worth between 
$13billion (£8billion) and $49billion (£30billion), with 90 per cent of 
all cocaine used in America originating from the country, according to a
 U.S. state report.

Casualty of war: Dr Gorrostieta is the latest official murdered by cartels in Mexico's bloody battle over drugs

The U.S. Justice Department considers
 the cartels as America’s greatest organised crime threat, while 
conceding that it is U.S. dollars that fund the crime ravaging Mexico.

In 2009 a military assessment 
predicted that if the drugs war continued for another 25 years, Mexico’s
 government was at serious risk of collapse and the conflict would 
spread into America.

A year earlier, the U.S. Joint Forces
 Command suggested a similar time-scale of collapse in Mexico and warned
 American intervention may be necessary due to the implications for 
homeland security.

The problem of strengthening the 
Mexico/U.S. border even prompted President Barack Obama to deploy 1,200 
National Guard troops in 2010.

The two major cartels in Mexico are now the Sinaloa Cartel and Los Zetas.

The Sinaloa Cartel was formed when several gangs agreed to join forces in 2006 and is now led by Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman.

He is Mexico's most wanted drug 
trafficker and is believed to be worth $1billion. Forbes magazing even 
declared him the 55th most powerful man in the world in 2009.

Los Zetas were originally a mercenary outfit of former elite members of the Mexican army by the Gulf Cartel.

Consisting of Airmobile Special 
Forces Group and Amphibian Group of Special Forces members, they helped 
control parts of Mexico for the Gulf Cartel until its leader, Osiel 
Cardenas Guillen, was arrested.

Los Zetas took the opportunity to 
seize power for themselves and are now a 300-strong independent drugs 
and arms trafficking gang under the leadership of Heriberto Lazcano.

Gorrostieta was born in 1976 and graduated in medicine from a university in the city of Morelia.

She was elected mayor of Tiquicheo in 2008 and served until 2011. During that time she defected from the Institutional Revolutionary party to the left-wing Democratic Revolution party.

In January 2009 her husband Jose Sanchez Chavez was set upon by an armed group but escaped

In October that year Maria was attacked while she was with her husband as they drove along in El Limone. Jose died that day from gunshot wounds. Maria survived but was taken to a hospital in Morelia, the state capital.

On January 23, 2010, she was attacked by men with machine guns in Ciudad Altamirano Guerrero, on her way to an event at the City Hall. She was severely injured after being hit by three bullets, as well as receiving wounds in the crash after the shooting, and had to use a colostomy bag. She said her wounds left her in constant pain.

On Saturday November 17 her body was found by farm workers from San Juan Tararameo, Cuitzeo Township, who were heading to work. She was discovered on the property known as El Chupadero. The next day she was identified by members of her family.
