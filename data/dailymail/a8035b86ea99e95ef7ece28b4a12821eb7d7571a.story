England's Adam Peaty wants to show the world what he can do by adding the 50 metres breaststroke crown to his gold from the 100m event earlier at Glasgow 2014.

The 19-year-old had little time to celebrate his success at the Tollcross Swimming Centre on Saturday, returning to the pool the following morning for the 50m heats.

Despite only managing three hours' sleep, Peaty showed no signs of fatigue as he set a new Commonwealth Games record by swimming 27 seconds flat, beating world-record holder Cameron van der Burgh by 0.39secs.

Winner: Adam Peaty blows a kiss to the crowd after a brilliant last 25 metres brought him a gold medal

The South African hit back in the evening session by setting a new Games record of 26.80s in his semi-final, although Peaty managed to set a new personal best of 26.99s to win his race shortly after.

It sets up a mouthwatering final on Monday evening, when Van der Burgh and Peaty will face tough competition from, among others, home favourite and 200m champion Ross Murdoch.

'Another PB, by 0.01 funnily enough, but it makes all the difference going below 27 for the first time,' Peaty said.

'There's a great crowd at the moment and they pushed me towards that.

'I think my medal chances are quite high if I just keep my composure and just keep calm.

'The main thing now is just having fun and relaxing. My 50 is just add-on event anyway - it is not an Olympic event - so I might as well just go out there and show the world what I can do.'

Ambition: Peaty is gunning for another gold in the 50m breaststroke

Asked about wrestling back the Games record he lost to Van der Burgh just hours after setting it, Peaty added: 'He is a world-class swimmer - obviously the Olympic champion as well - so it will be a very close race.

'I had a right ball there - it was really, really fun. Just coming out to the crowd is amazing so I am just taking it all in.'

Murdoch is among three Scots in the final with Mark Tully and Joe Welstead.

Disbelief: Peaty seems shocked after setting another record during his powerful showing in 50m heat

'I am so proud to get into another final and represent my country again,' Murdoch said. 'I am also proud of the other two boys who smashed their personal bests to make it.

'Now I am looking for a personal best. I am a lot more relaxed than I was the first couple of nights.'

Scotland took their medal tally in the pool to nine on Sunday night thanks to silver in the men's 200m freestyle relay and bronze for Hannah Miley and 13-year-old Erraid Davies.

England also won three medals with Fran Halsall and Siobhan-Marie O'Connor taking golds and Liam Tancock adding a bronze.
