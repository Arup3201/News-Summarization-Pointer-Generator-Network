Arrested: David Charles allegedly stole brain tissues and other material from a museum to sell

A man broke into a museum and stole jars of human brain tissue he then sold to another man who put them on eBay, police have said.

David Charles, 21, was busted after a tipster who paid hundreds of dollars online for the organs realized the material was from a museum and contacted police.

Charles, from Indianapolis, allegedly broke into the Indiana Medical History Museum on multiple occasions to steal the jars and other preserved material.

The museum is at the site of a former state hospital and the tissues come from around 2,000 patients with psychiatric and mental disorders who were autopsied there from the 1890s until the 1940s.

The museum endured several break-ins at its storage facility and police had investigated, but they were only led to Charles after the phone call from the buyer, the Indianapolis Star reported.

The San Diego man, who has not been named, had bought six jars of human brain tissue for $600 and called the museum after noticing labels on the 
containers, court documents said.

The buyer told museum staff that he bought the tissue as he was a collector of strange items.

Detectives traced the transactions 
and identified the eBay seller, who said he had obtained the tissues 
from Charles, police said.

On December 16, the eBay seller arranged to meet Charles at a Dairy Queen parking lot and the alleged thief, who had stole 60 jars the day before, met him there, unaware it was a sting.

Police swooped in and Charles was arrested. Another man he was with had reached for a handgun but was tackled by officers and arrested.

Charles now faces charges of theft, marijuana possession and paraphernalia possession, according to court documents. Additional charges may also be sought.

Investigators also are looking into the possibility of additional charges, said A.J. Deer, a spokesman for the Marion County prosecutorâ€™s office.

Much of the stolen material has now been returned to the museum.

A pre-trial conference for Charles has been scheduled for January 13.
