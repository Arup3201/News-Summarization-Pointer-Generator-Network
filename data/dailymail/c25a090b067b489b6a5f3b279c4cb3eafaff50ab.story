'Woman Sitting in an Armchair' will be returned to the descendants of art dealer Paul Rosenberg, from whom it was taken by the Nazis

Germany has signed an agreement to return to its rightful owner an Henri Matisse painting that was seized under Nazi rule.

Matisse's 'Woman Sitting in an Armchair' was part of a trove of artworks found in the apartment of late collector Cornelius Gurlitt.

Experts say the painting was taken from art dealer Paul Rosenberg and rightfully belongs to his descendants.

Culture Minister Monika Gruetters' office confirmed a report in German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung today that she signed the agreement.

A similar agreement was signed last week for a painting by Max Liebermann.

Both agreements must be approved by a Munich court handling Gurlitt's inheritance.

A Swiss museum that accepted Gurlitt's bequest of his collection has promised to ensure any Nazi-looted pieces are returned to their Jewish owners' heirs.

Around 250 artworks were found in Gurlitt's Salzburg property. Switzerland's Kunstmuseum Bern inherited the collection  

Some 1,280 others found in Gurlitt's apartment in Munich. While some of the Munich works were already known, it was the first look for many at the art Gurlitt kept in the house he owned in Austria. 

It includes works by Breughel, Monet, Renoir and Picasso.

Gurlitt inherited much of the art from his father, who in the 1930s helped the Nazis sell art they considered 'degenerate' to buyers outside of Germany for cash. 

Some of the works — including Impressionist and modern masterpieces — had been seized by the Nazis from museums, while others were stolen or bought for a pittance from Jewish collectors who were forced to sell.

Gurlitt died in May last year at age 81, designating the Swiss museum as his sole heir.
