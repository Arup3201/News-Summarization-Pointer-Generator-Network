This is the heart-stopping moment a daredevil loses his balance on a sky-high building – and nearly falls to his death.

The man, a 24-year-old called Sergey, is filmed doing a backflip but instead of landing squarely on his feet, his left foot misses the platform and he almost falls 150 metres to the ground below.

But rather than crying over the close shave Sergey - who performed the stunt in Ashdod, Israel - laughs it off.

And this isn’t his first brush with death.

The man suffered concussion after flipping off a wall and landing on his head, and another time he broke his leg performing a stunt.

And a well-known member of the parkour community, the Russian Pavel Kashin, died last year after performing the very same backflip on a 16-storey building.

Parkour is a sport which developed from military obstacle training and involves getting from A to B in the most efficient way possible – without the use of safety equipment.

Daredevil: Sergey, 24, stands atop a building in Ashdod, Israel. He is practicing parkour, a sport which involves climbing buildings with no safety equipment

Admiring the view: Sergey stands on a crane and takes in the sights over Ashdod, Israel

Sergey, who works in surveying, said: ‘I was scared, but fears keeps you from death. But with that, I feel great and ready to make the next flip.’

‘Parkour is dangerous but life is dangerous.

‘There is a Tibetan saying – we do not know what will come before – tomorrow or new life.

‘In parkour you overcome the obstacles – both physically and mentally.’

Hanging in there: Sergey risks his life climbing buildings with no safety equipment. In the past he has broken his leg and suffered concussion after landing on his head

In pole position: Sergey walks across a pole between highrise buildings

Monkey bars: Sergey makes his way to the end of a crane overlooking the city. He doesn't wear a harness, meaning one slip and he falls to his death. But he's philosophical about it, saying life is dangerous too
