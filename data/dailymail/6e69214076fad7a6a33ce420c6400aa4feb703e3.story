A 62-year-old man was found dead in an empty bathtub in his Brooklyn apartment on Saturday morning - naked, bleeding from the head, and with chemical burns on his body.

The New York Police Department says officers arrived at the Coney Island apartment about 9 a.m. to find an emotionally disturbed 54-year-old man trying to bar them from entering.

They struggled with him, until one officer flashed a Taser, at which point he calmed down and allowed the officers to enter the apartment.

The officers made their way through the filthy, two-bedroom apartment, which the brothers shared, and found the older sibling dead in the tub.

The 62-year-old’s body was sitting up in the tub; his genitals covered with a rag or washcloth, police said.

His head was bloody, and he had bleach burns to his chest and left leg and was pronounced dead at the scene.

Investigators tried talking to the man, but ‘some of the stuff he’s saying doesn’t make sense,’ a police department spokesman told The New York Times.

The younger brother had second- and third-degree chemical burns on his arms and had to be washed down with a hose by firefighters at the scene

The dead man's brother was taken to Staten Island University Hospital for a psychological evaluation and treatment of his burns

‘My brother is in the bathtub,’ he told cops before he was eventually escorted from the building by EMTs.

He had second- and third-degree chemical burns on his arms and had to be washed down with a hose by firefighters at the scene.

He was taken to Staten Island University Hospital for a psychological evaluation and treatment of his burns.

Medical examiners haven’t yet determined what caused his death, and it’s not yet certain what chemical caused the burns to his chest and left leg. Police haven’t released the brothers’ names.
