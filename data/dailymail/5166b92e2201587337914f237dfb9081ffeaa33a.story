The sight of skipping lambs and trees full of blossom are a good indicator that winter is finally at an end.

The past rains might have caused havoc for humans, but have meant that a huge magnolia tree in Devon has blossomed like never before.

Britain’s widest Magnolia campbellii, which is widely considered to be the finest kind of magnolia tree, has not bloomed fully for the past five years but this spring has produced an array of magnificent flowers in Lukesland Gardens in Dartmoor, Devon.

While the pink tree is not the tallest in the country, it is thought to be the widest,  and when it was officially measured 10 years ago, it had a spread of over 98ft (30metres).

Its owners, Mr and Mrs Howell, who own the gardens, think it could be as large as 131ft (40metres) across now.

Late frosts have stunted the tree’s flowering over the past five years, but the last six months of wet weather has transformed the tree’s fortunes.

One of the garden's owners thinks that magnolia trees up and 
down the UK have benefitted from the combination of wet and then 
warm weather will be doing well and that ‘It’s going to be a great year 
for them, Lorna Howell said. Magnolia trees are grown in the Himalayas and have large delicate flowers (pictured left). They are very sensitive to cold but have grown well in Dartmoor, Devon this year (pictured right) in a deeper pink

‘Last year it came into bud – they were large and looked ready to burst – but in March there was snow and the buds grew black and dropped off,' Lorna Howell told MailOnline.

‘The ground was covered in black buds. It was so sad’ she added.

In other years the tree has been hit by frost and only some of its buds survived so that it flowered in a patchy and meagre way.

‘But this year it’s fantastic. It obviously liked the wet weather and the warm sunshine now - and it’s not even fully out yet,’ she said.

Mrs Howell expects the tree to bloom for two weeks, or even a week if the weather remains mild.

‘The flowers are so big, showy and exotic that they are very sensitive to frost and the cold. We’ve got away without that this year and they’re doing well,’ Mrs Howell said.

Magnolia campbellii are a Himalayan plant and the couple spent time in Nepal learning about them.

Their tree grows near a stream and has a lot of space in the garden and Mrs Howell thinks its location makes it so healthy.

It was planted in the 1930s by her husband’s grandfather who was part of the Canadian Forestry Corps in World War One.

The couple are opening their garden this Sunday, March 15 as part of the National Gardens Scheme so that people can enjoy the spectacle.

They will open on Sundays from 11am to 5pm and on Wednesdays too.

The mild weather has also meant that rhododendrons are blooming more than two weeks earlier than usual at Lea Gardens near Matlock, Derbyshire.
