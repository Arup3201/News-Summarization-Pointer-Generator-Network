Picture the scene: You're out on the town and you spot someone you like the look of, but how do you make a move without the cringey chat-up lines and awkward silences?

Fret not, the real life Hitch is here to help convert you into a smooth talking Romeo and get the girl or guy of your dreams.

Rob Beckster, the self-proclaimed 'white Hitch', prides himself as the number one seduction artist in Europe.

Can he help YOU find love? Meet Rob Beckster: The real life hitch who thinks he can help anyone pull in fourteen days

The 36-year-old from London is so convinced by his pick-up prowess that he set up his own seduction school, which he calls The Beckster Lifestyle.

'The Beckster Lifestyle is all about living life to the full and doing so on your terms,' he says.

'It’s about becoming your best and most attractive self and learning how to display your new qualities to the men or women you truly desire.'

Beckster teaches something he calls the ‘Naturally Seductive Game’, which he explains is a method that seamlessly combines the beliefs and mindset of the natural seducer with the learned techniques of the so called ‘pick-up artist’.

The white Hitch: Rob, who has his own seduction school, has been compared to Will Smith's character in the 2005 romantic comedy, Hitch (right)

He runs two schools, the £750 weekend Beckster Lifestyle Bootcamp or a week-long Beckster Lifestyle Residential course, where you move in with the man himself in his Chelsea office and learn the tricks of the trade for a cool £4,900.

Beckster, who set up his company 16 years ago because he 'needed it himself', uses his tried-and-tested 'five Cs': confidence, congruency, calibration, courage and conviction.

He trains men and women - although men make up 90 per cent of his clientelle - how to dress, act and even dance to attract someone they fancy.

To help him out, Beckster has
 selected an 'elite group' of specialist trainers who help clientele learn how to acquire and develop confidence, social skills, 
attraction, style, dance, dating and seduction.

In action: Beckster teaches men and women how to chat people up, how to dance and how to avoid awkward conversation

Skills: Beckster set up his dating schools 16 years ago after he failed to land a woman, he said he knew there was something out there to help; so he created it

He then unleashes his students to put their newly acquired skills to the test in local parks, shopping malls and nightclubs.

But does it work? Beckster's clients pride themselves on collecting as many as 16 numbers in one day.

So what are his secrets of seduction? Firstly, chat-up lines are out.

'Chat-up lines are so 12 years ago,' Beckster told MailOnline. 'I help bring out the best in people, so I teach them how to talk to everyone in a group, we rehearse conversation pieces, teach people how to make their stories sound better and how to divert conversation topics to keep the chat flowing.'

He also employs a Royal Ballet School ballerina to teach clients how to look good on the dancefloor. He said: 'Women should use their hips - that's sexy. Men should have one fancy move, it should be fun. No one buys those serious moves.

It worked for him! Beckster has been dating 
ballerina Candice, 31, for three years now - she even works for him as the 
stylist and dance coach

'Give a high five, give a girl a spin, mouth "hi" but definitely don't be a dance floor predator and grind behind a girl,' he advises.

His clients range in age from 19 to 50 and he even coaches people on how to keep the spark in their marriage alive.

He is currently using a new method: getting people to bet on their friends getting a date.

He has found that the naturally competitive nature of men kicks in when they are bet by friends to fail in their quest for love and spurs them on to succeed.

He claims that by using his method and asking your friend to place a bet on your success rate - he uses tedbets.com - anyone can get a girl in 14 days.

It worked for him - Beckster has been dating his girlfriend - who also happens to be the company's fashion coach and dancer - for three years.

'My main aim is to ban sleazy and make seduction something more positive. It's the next evolution of this industry,' he says.

    Confidence and self esteem improvement and repair: Beckster teaches guys and girls to play to their strengths and be the best they can be    Advanced verbal and non-verbal communication skills for all areas of your life including attraction and dating: He teaches people conversation pieces and they rehearse narratives, scripts and how to divert conversations (such as set conversations on heels so a man can complement a woman's shoes and then take the conversation further based on a rehearsed script about shoes)    Wardrobe reinvention and complete style makeover: Beckster's girlfriend and style director helps people wear the right colour clothes for their skin tone and body shape    Advanced dance skills for fun and seduction: A Royal ballerina teaches women how to use their hips to seduce and men fancy yet fun moves    How to maintain a healthy relationship beyond the ‘honeymoon period’: He teaches people how to add spark to a relationship and how to make date night special
