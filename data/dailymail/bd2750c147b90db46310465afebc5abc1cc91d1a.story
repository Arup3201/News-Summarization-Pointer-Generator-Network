A high school class in Germany has apologised after teenage pupils allegedly started greeting each other with 'Heil Hitler' and communicating in Nazi slogans.

The children of class 9a said sorry for their actions on Facebook after intense pressure from parents and staff at the school, in Leipzig in east Germany - but claimed that not all of them were involved.

It comes after it emerged that all 29 members of the class - including a Jewish boy - subscribed to a WhatsApp chatroom where Hitler and the Nazis were routinely praised.

The Landsberg Gymnasiums students said: 'We, as class 9a from the Landsberg Grammar School, apologise for everything that has been published which has caused our school damage, and that which is still to come. 

'These were ill considered actions which we are not able to make up for.

'Furthermore, it was not the whole class which was responsible. That's why we would like to apologise, even to our uninvolved classmates.'

They accused the BILD newspaper in Germany, which broke the story, of 'twisting' facts 'but want to apologise for these anyway, even if they were not meant seriously. And we promise that never again will there be such behaviour in the class of 9a again.' 

It was signed on behalf of 'all those responsible'. 

Parents and authorities were left horrified after it emerged that some of the 14 and 15-year-olds had been swapping Nazi sayings and slogans throughout the school day. 

Local media reports suggested students regularly made anti-Jewish slurs on the messaging app, while praising Hitler as a 'great man'. 

Fear: Parents are in shock after media reports that students in the class, boys and girls ages 14 and 15, appear to have been engaging in the behaviour on WhatsApp 

One of the messages from a student made a Holocaust joke that read: 'Why did Hitler kill himself? The Jews sent him the gas bill.' 

Two youngsters - believed to be the ringleaders - are now under intense police scrutiny after they stuck on fake Hitler moustaches and were photographed giving the Nazi salute inside school classrooms.

The school is currently closed for the autumn half term but police detectives, psychologists, educationalists and parents are set for stormy meetings there with the headmaster in a week's time when it reopens.

The praise of, or display of, Nazism and its symbols is strictly forbidden in Germany and first offences can carry a maximum prison term of six months.

Police want to determine whether the pro-Nazi sentiments expressed by the youngsters were merely a form of teen rebellion or if they went deeper.

Gampel, the former head of the local Halle Jewish Community, said his son had experienced harassment at the school.

'My son told me that someone had stuck a far-right NPD [National Democratic Party] sticker on his jacket. It was well known, it seems, that he was Jewish.'

'I have made a formal complaint with police for an investigation, but on the other hand it would definitely be the wrong thing to simply accuse the entire class and tar them with the same brush.'  

He said: 'Even after I read about it, I found it difficult to get him to talk about what went on. It was only through a lengthy discussion that he admitted what was in the newspaper article was essentially true.' 

A spokesman for the state educational affairs minister in Saxony-Anhalt said: 'I am shocked. If this is true there can only be one way forward here: zero tolerance.'

The WhatsApp exchanges have been handed over to police and prosecutors.

In shock: The school, Landsberg Gymnasiums near Leipzig, where the teenagers all study

The school headmaster Lutz Feudel said the entire school had been shocked, and that the secret Nazi sympathisers were confined to one class.

Getting to the bottom of how it happened would be difficult because the autumn break had already started, he said.

He said the parents of two of the children involved had been invited to a discussion together with their children, but that a third who they wanted to speak to was on holiday in Spain.

He said he did not want to instantly accuse the children, saying: 'Breaking taboos is part of young adulthood. I don't believe that they wanted to actively promote neo-Nazi ideology.' 

All the class students, like all children in Germany, have visited a Nazi concentration camp and regularly learn about the excesses of the Third Reich in classes.   

Neo-Nazi groups significantly stepped up their recruitment of children in recent years.

The state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern near Berlin has started carrying out background checks on would-be kindergarten employees after it was discovered several had been infiltrated by far-right females.
