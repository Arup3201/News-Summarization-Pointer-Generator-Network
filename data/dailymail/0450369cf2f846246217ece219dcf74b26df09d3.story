A coyote spent an hour on top of a New York bar after it made its way through an abandoned building.

The coyote was filmed above the LIC bar in Long Island City, Queens, New York before it fled into an old paint factory.

A vet climbed up towards the roof to look at the coyote but soon retreated. 

According to the LIC Post, Mr Porter said: 'It looked well fed, it wasn't a scrawny thing.' 

Mr Porter said it was the first time that he had ever seen a coyote in the area. 

However, there have been numerous sightings of coyotes living in New York over the past twelve months. 

According to the New York Times, coyotes have been spotted in Pelham Bay Park, Riverside Park and even on Stuyvesant Town on the East Side. 

There are also claims that there is one coyote living in Railroad Park, Jamaica, Queens.

Coyotes begun colonising urban areas and can be found in many parks across New York City

The NYC Parks Department advises residents against feeding coyotes as they should be kept wary of humans

According to the New York City Parks Department, coyotes are becoming more prevalent across the city

As a result in the explosion in the numbers of coyotes living within the five boroughs, New York's Park Department has even issued guidelines on what to do if you come in contact with a coyote.

Coyotes are native to North America and were traditionally found in deserts or on the plains. However, now they have begun colonising urban areas and can be found in many parks across New York City. 

The NYC Parks Department advises residents against feeding coyotes as they should be kept wary of humans. 

They warn that coyotes can be mostly seen during the mating season of January to March or when the pups leave between October and January.
