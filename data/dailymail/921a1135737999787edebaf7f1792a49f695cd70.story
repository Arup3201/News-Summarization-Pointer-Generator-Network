She's the queen of celebrity hairstyles, but Blake Lively has revealed she doesn't need expensive products to keep her tresses glowing - instead opting for seawater.

The A-list actress confessed to using jugs of ocean water to make her locks 'crunchy' giving her the texture she needs to perfect those beachy waves she's famous for.

Blake, 26, who is married to actor Ryan Reynolds, admitted she snubs hot tools - preferring to air-dry her hair, running some coconut oil through the ends before shampooing, then putting it up in a ballerina bun.

Stunning locks: But Blake Lively reveals keeping her hair healthy is 'effortless'

'My hair is always better in California than it is in New York, so I got a big water jug and I filled it with ocean, which is probably a really bad idea, but I would put it on my hair, and, actually, it worked,' Blake told style.com.

'It’s salt and it’s water and it makes your hair a little crunchier and holds it a little better.'

And just like every other woman, Blake, who shot to fame as Serena Van der Woodsen on Gossip Girl, admits she's had hair disasters in the past.

'My sister has this red mousse because she has red hair, and I used that once, which is not advisable,’ she said.

'Don’t use red mousse if you’re a blonde!' she added, admitting that she ended up looking like 'Cyndi Lauper'.

But the Green Lantern actress revealed that the main secret to her perfectly coiffed hair is that it doesn't take much effort.

Blake, who is one of the celebrity faces of L'Oreal, said she swears by the brand's Elvive Fibrology to make her hair 'thick and full and healthy'.

'You think, "OK, I see these commercials and they do these fancy Spider-Man graphics, but does that really work?".

'[But]
 it’s really, really incredible. So all the [women] in my family are now
 on this shampoo and we all use it and all swear by it.'

The
 actress, who recently completed the romantic drama The Age Of Adaline, also
 gets tips from YouTube videos, confessing: 'I’ve also seen that YouTube
 video too many times where the girl teaches you how to curl your hair.

'You know, the one with the 12-year-old girl? Oh, my God. It’s amazing. It’s really, really amazing.'

In-keeping with her healthy outlook on life, Blake says she's opting for lighter foods as it's summertime, swearing by kale chips as a snack, and mint tea from Cafe Gitane in New York City.

And
 she says she's a low-maintenance type of wife as well - citing her 
ideal date night with Ryan as: 'Just a good homemade meal and watching 
some TCM [Turner Classic Movies].

'That's a pretty good night in.'
