A football team has caused an uproar among fans after proposing to use a real lion as their mascot during next season's AFL games at The Brisbane Cricket Ground.

The Brisbane Lions hope to stage the caged team mascot as part of their pre-match entertainment next season at home grounds, which is commonly known as The Gabba. 

But the idea has sparked outrage as protesters took to social media, describing the act as 'cruel' and 'stupid', as some even plan to boycott future games.

The initiative was put forward by the Brisbane Lions as the animal could act as their mascot

The club's CEO Greg Swann defended the proposed initiative, saying a decision is yet to be handed down. 

'There has been a fair amount of hysteria today around the idea of having a real lion at our home games next season,' Swann said in a statement on Thursday.

'Let me be clear in saying it is an idea and only that.

'We simply asked ourselves whether we might be able to add the 'real thing' to a match day experience.'

Swann revealed the live lion was just one of the many proposed initiatives discussed for next season. 

'It is one of a number of initiatives we have discussed as part of planning for the 2015 season, and it has found its way into the media,' he said.

'Animal welfare would always be the overwhelming priority in any such idea, but let me stress we are only at a conceptual stage at the moment.'

AFL CEO Gillon McLachlan described the proposal as a 'provocative idea'.

'Greg is making noise up there in Brisbane and we love that,' he said.

'I love the fact he's pushing the envelope.'

However the proposal has enraged fans, who expressed their disgust on Facebook and Twitter.

'Kids want to see a person in a suit as a mascot not a living animal being stressed out in a cage,' Nikki Lobwein wrote. 

'Very disappointing that you would even consider such a cruel and archaic idea.'

It is believed the Lions club is speaking to zoos, lion parks and animal welfare groups

Fans expressed their outrage on social media, urging the club to reject the initiative

Gail Boyd encouraged others to boycott future games if the idea was approved

Barbra Bennett wrote that it was a 'stupid idea to have a live animal paraded around in a cage'.

Gail Boyd says she expected her club to set a better example.

'How about the Brisbane Lions all come out with a huge collar and chains around their necks and see how it feels,' she wrote.

'Shame on your team for even considering this as entertainment ... I would encourage every Brisbane lions supporters and every other teams supporters that play against you to boycott the match/es you intend to have this animal at.'

A Change petition has been circulating online, since the news came to light.

Jordan Lees, who began the petition which has nearly 11,000 supporters, says a football field is no place for a lion.

'The problem with this proposal is that is continues a trend of exploiting animals for our amusement,' he wrote.

'A lion does not belong on a football field. There are many alternative methods of entertainment that Brisbane Lions may employ to attract more fans to the games.

'Perhaps winning more games would be a good place to start.'
