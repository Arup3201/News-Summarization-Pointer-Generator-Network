Pioneering lens implants that promise to restore vision to those plagued by failing eyesight have been used for the first time.

The lenses are designed to help those suffering from not only long and short-sightedness, but also cataracts or astigmatism.

The plastic lenses – which are inserted in a simple operation and should never need to be replaced – use tiny circular grooves to change the way light is bent and offer smooth shifts in focus.

They cost around £3,900 for each eye and are not funded by the NHS.

London’s Claremont Clinic is one of the first places in the world to offer the procedure.

One patient, Susan Wright, 57, a charity consultant from Macclesfield who suffered from cataracts and long-sightedness, said: ‘I have never had particularly good eyesight. I had cataracts and long-sightedness and I would get a sense that there was a blank space in part of my vision.

‘Now my mid and long-range vision is absolutely excellent and I have been told my short range vision will continue to improve. Colours are much brighter and everything is sharper.’ 

Previous correctional lenses have had problems causing glare and halo bursts and do not focus smoothly like the natural eyes.

Trials showed 81 per cent of users reported 20/20 long-distance vision after the surgery, 98 per cent said they no longer needed glasses for distance vision, 96 per cent for middle distance, and 73 per cent for near distance.

Jenny Brindley, 58, who had to wear glasses at seven, said: ‘Before the operation my eyesight had deteriorated a lot. Gradually things were becoming more and more yellow. I was quite short-sighted and that had got worse and things were quite misty.

‘I like art and visiting galleries and watching foreign films so my eyesight was stopping me doing a lot of things.

‘I wore prescription glasses from the age of seven, but I work with children with autism and they grab at them a lot.

‘After the first operation it was the first time I could see the end of the bedroom clearly. I noticed for the first time that my husband’s jumper was purple. I had always thought it was brown. It’s really much better than I expected.’
