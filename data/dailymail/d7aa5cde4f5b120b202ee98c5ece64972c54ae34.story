The father of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has spoken out about how the FBI urged him to go to Moscow to speak with his son.

Lon Snowden, a former U.S. Coast Guard, said in interview with the Washington Post, he asked to speak with his son but the FBI told him it wasn't possible. Instead they asked him to visit his son in Moscow.

Speaking to Washington Post reporter Jerry Markon, the supportive father said: 'I was asked if I would consider flying to Moscow. And I said "yes, but however, I want to know what the objective is and I want to be able to speak to my son to see if there is value, because I'm not going to fly to Moscow to sit on the tarmac to be an emotional tool for you, for the government".'

Edward's father, Lon Snowden, pictured on the 'Today' show last week, said the FBI asked him to go to Moscow to speak with his son, but said he would not be used as an emotional pawn

Snowden's son Edward remains holed up in the transit area of a Moscow airport, awaiting documents so he can be granted a temporary visa to stay in Russia.

He plans to seek asylum in Russia and has spoken of wanting to make a permanent home in exile in South America.

In an hour-long interview, the father backed his son's position and described him as 'wholesome' and patriotic'.

He said his son grew up in Maryland surrounded by federal agents and law enforcers in his family, but Edward was always the 'brilliant one'. 'I have never known him to be cruel or harsh with anyone at any time,' he said.

Snowden Jr began working in intelligence in 2003, he told the reporter, under the Bush administration; he saw how things evolved, he told the reporter.

With the arrival of the Obama administration he hoped that things would change, but Snowden Sr said rather than getting better, things got worse.

Since leaking the National Security Documents to Wikileaks, Snowden Jr has been trapped in the transit area of Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport, unable to travel and seek asylum elsewhere because the U.S. revoked his passport.

His father believes he is doing the right thing remaining in Russia, since he says the U.S. institutions and media have generated 'propaganda' about his son and he would not be given a fair trial if he were to return.

He said: 'Where at this point, unless someone's been living in a cave without a TV, can my son get a fair trial?'

He said, based on the behaviour of the U.S. government, both the Congress and Justice departments, he has lost confidence that they are operating in good faith.

He described the operations of the U.S. leaders as 'absolutely amateurish'.

Anatoly Kucherena (L), the Russian lawyer assisting Snowden, told media at Sheremetyevo airport last week that Snowden has been granted the papers that will allow him to leave the transit area of a Moscow airport where he is holed up

He pointed out that to those who believe he is a traitor or a spy, there is no benefit to his son to expose the truth.

'He has chosen to release information at great peril to himself, to expose that people's constitutional rights are being violated by the government,' he said.
