A high school football player who clashed heads with an opponent during a game thought little of the knock.

But after hitting his shoulder during practice days later, he was left in a coma with a huge brain swelling and internal bleeding.

Six years later, aged 23, he struggles to remember things from just hours earlier and cannot walk unaided.

Cody Lehe, from Indiana, is one of dozens of promising young footballers to have fallen victim to the terrifying 'Second Impact Syndrome'.

SIS is very rare and always happens to high school or college-age players, according toÂ  Dr Michael Turner, whose case study on Cody was published yesterday in the Journal of Neurosurgery.

'It's probably something to do with the 
immature brain, because our brain really keeps growing until you're 18, 
19 years old,' said Dr Turner.

For years, doctors believed teenagers who 
suffered from SIS had blood clots from their first concussions, which went unnoticed until the second impact triggered brain swelling and further 
bleeding.

But Cody had had a CT scan after the head clash, 
the first to exist for an SIS patient between hits, which showed nothing.

Dangerous: Second Impact Syndrome is thought to cause blood vessels to swell and push against the brain, causing the loss of ability to walk, talk and recall simple things

No one had been especially worried about Cody, because he had not passed or thrown up as a victim of concussion normally would.

After taking
the second hit, however, the 17-year-old walked off the field and toppled 
forward into another player, dizzy, his legs numb. Then he collapsed, his body shaking with seizures.

Dr Turner now believes that Cody's brain sent a message 
to the rest of his body for more blood, which filled the veins and 
arteries in his head and caused his brain to swell against the skull, causing further injury and damage.

The ambulance technicians told his mother Becky that they didn't think he would make it to the hospital, she told ABC News.

Cody had to spend 55 days in the intensive 
care unit - the same number as the one on his football jersey - and a further 43 in its rehab unit.

He had suffered temporary cardiac arrest, hypertension, 
pneumonia, renal failure and sepsis. He could not walk or talk.

SIS occurs when a person - most often a teenager - sustains a second head injury before recovery from an earlier head injury is complete.

The second hit causes the brain to swell catastrophically, but it is the first injury that makes the player a walking time bomb.

If, within several weeks, the victim suffers a second head injury, brain swelling, internal bleeding and death can occur within minutes.

Experts believe that after the second hit, the brain loses its ability to auto-regulate.

Blood vessel walls become less stiff and expand like a garden hose that becomes fatter as it ages. If enough blood vessels swell, it makes the brain bigger, squashing tissue up against the skull.

There is serious concern about this problem in sport because so many players suffer head injuries. Nobody knows the true number because they are often dismissed as 'dings' and 'bell-ringers'.

Cody has regained the 
ability to speak, but still lacks short-term memory. He can walk on a 
treadmill for six minutes at a time with someone at his 
side, but he can't balance on his own and depends on a wheelchair to get
around.

'For someone who wasn't supposed 
to make it through, he's beaten all the odds,' said Mrs Lehe, adding that 
she now sees a different side to her son that had previously been 
reserved only for his school friends. 'He was a class clown. He was 
hilarious, but we didn't see that much at home.'

Dr Turner said Cody's case showed that athletes need 
to get off the playing field if they've had head injuries.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released guidelines 
suggesting that players with signs of concussion should be removed from 
play and not return until they have permission from their doctor and 
show no symptoms with exertion.

In August 2011, 22-year-old starting fullback Derek 
Sheely died a week after collapsing at football practice at Frostburg 
State University. His uncontrollable 
brain swelling led doctors and his father to believe it was SIS.

An estimated 1.7million people receive a traumatic brain injury, including concussions, each year, according to the CDC.

Cody's mother Mrs Lehe added: 'I think the biggest thing is we have got to get the kids to understand to listen to their bodies.

'We have this gladiator mentality 
out there,' she said. 'Be tough. Hang in there. Take one for the 
team... We've got to change.'
