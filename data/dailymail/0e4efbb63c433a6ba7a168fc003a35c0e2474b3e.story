It's a river made famous by Alan Jackson's ode to easy living - but the Chattahoochee is harboring darker secrets these days.

The bodies of three people have been pulled from its muddy waters outside Atlanta in less than two weeks - and now the FBI is investigating.

The death of at least one of the victims,Â  34-year-old Perfecto Ochoa Alvarado, has been ruled a homicide.

Authorities haven't said whether they think the deaths are related, but the FBI has picked up the latest case.

On Sunday, a woman's body was spotted on the bank at the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area's Vickery Creek Park.

Deadly Chattahoochee: Authorities have pulled three bodies out of the river in suburban Atlanta in the past 12 days

The first body was pulled from the river near Johns River, Georgia, on May 3. It was identified as 57-year-old Gee Hang.

'It looked to be a female. We could see a tattoo on her back, shirt was kind of bunched up to here, she was laid over log by her stomach. The log had her stuck,' Brandon Davis, who spotted the body, told WSB-TV.

Witness Baker Martin said: 'She had no shoes on and designer jeans, so no business being in the river, or planning on being in the river.'

The Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office has not yet ruled on a cause of death and is waiting for a toxicology report.

Murdered: The death of Perfecto Ochoa Alvarado, 34, whose badly decomposed body was found in the river on May 5, was ruled a homicide

Alvarado was found dead May 5 on the banks of the Chattahoochee River by two fishermen

She had not been reported missing before she was found dead.

Two days after Ms Hang was discovered, fishermen spotted the badly-decomposed remains of Alvarado.

Investigators say Alvarado was killed up to two weeks before his body was found near Austell, Georgia.

His death was ruled a homicide, though authorities have not said how he died or where he was killed.

Authorities have not released the identity of the woman found dead Friday. The FBI is investigating the case because the remains were found on federal land in a national recreation area.
