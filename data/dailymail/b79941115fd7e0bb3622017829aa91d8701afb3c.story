A man accused of killing his ex-girlfriend and then driving hundreds of miles to dump her body recorded an interview about the case with the 'Dr. Phil' show just two days before confessing to detectives, it has emerged.

Mark Augustin Castellano, a 37-year-old computer technician, has been charged with the murder of 31-year-old Michelle Warner after he confessed to police.

Her body was found in a West Texas oil field  on Sunday evening after she had been missing from her Houston home for a week.

Controversial: Dr. Phil, pictured, also conducted an interview with Ms. Warner's family for the show, which is due to air on Thursday

However, it has now emerged that during a two-hour interview with detectives, Castellano said he had taped an interview for the 'Dr. Phil' show on Friday.

Houston Detective Fil Waters said: 'I thought he was kidding, but it was
the real deal.

'He talks to Dr. Phil, provides Dr. Phil 
as I understand it, with the same information he's been providing 
everyone else.'

In a 
brief statement, Stacey Luchs, a spokeswoman for the 'Dr. Phil' show 
said: 'Mr. Castellano sat down for an interview with Dr. Phil in Texas 
just before his confession to law enforcement, late last week.

'Dr. Phil also conducted an interview with Ms. Warner's family for this show, which is currently scheduled to air on Thursday.'

The statement did not say what Castellano talked about during his interview.

Castellano initially told investigators
that Warner had run out on him and their 3-year-old son. Her family 
later reported her missing to police.

Castellano, who was staying with his son at his parents' home in Odessa in West Texas, had kept in contact with police and agreed to return to Houston on Sunday to speak with investigators.

During a two-hour interview, Castellano told investigators he killed Warner after an argument in their apartment in which he grabbed her by the throat and apparently snapped her neck, Waters said.

He is scheduled to have his initial court appearance today. Court records did not list an attorney for him.

Waters said Castellano told investigators his son was in the apartment when he killed Warner but did not witness the slaying.

Afterwards, Castellano drove his son to this parents' home before returning to Houston for Warner's body, the detective said. He put it in a plastic container, placed that in Warner's car and then drove back to Odessa.

'He spends a day and a half trying to figure out what he is going to do with Michelle. She, in the meantime, is in the backseat of the car, which is parked at his parents' house,' Waters said.

He added that Castellano's parents didn't know Warner's body was in the car outside their home.

Eventually, Castellano decided to take the body to nearby Midland, where he dumped it in a ditch in an oil field, covering it with some dirt.

'His comment was, "I didn't really try to hide her. I'm surprised you all haven't found her already,"' Waters said.

Odessa police and FBI agents found the body. An autopsy is pending to confirm Warner's identity and determine the cause of death.

'Had he not confessed, we would still be stuck,' Waters said. 'His timeline was plausible. We had no physical evidence. We had our suspicions.'

The couple had a history of fighting, he said.

Friends and family said Miss Warner, 31, was last seen at the Regency Square Apartment Complex, where she lived with Castellano and their three-year-old son, Cayden.

People close to Miss Warner described her as very bubbly and talkative, and said that she would have never severed communication with friends or taken off without her son.

Miss Warner, who also has an 11-year-old daughter who lives with her father, was about to start a new job as a paralegal and was excited about working again after spending the last 18 months unemployed, Click2Houston reported.

Her family said Warner moved in with Castellano for financial reasons, but the two were not currently dating.

Longtime friend Stephanie Helton, who has been friends with Warner since grade school, told ABC that the relationship between Warner and Castellano has 'never been a good situation.'

Ms Helton said the two met when all three of them were working for a home health care provider.

In 2008, Warner became pregnant with Cayden, but the relationship with the father of her child was not going well because Castellano had 'psychotic spells.'

Family: Warner has a three-year-old son, Cayden,
left, with Mark Castellano, and an 11-year-old daughter from a previous
relationship

Search efforts: A search effort was mounted for Warner while friends hung her pictures around the local neighborhood  

'He had episodes, he tried suicide ...,' she told ABC. 'He's done other crazy things. Nothing extra-violent; he's push[ed] her up against the wall, that type of thing. He's threatened her.'

Ms Helton said that according to her friend's family member, at around 7pm last Saturday, Castellano and Warner got into a fight, during which the man threw their pet cat against a wall.

The mother of two got upset and hit him before storming out of the apartment on Bellerive Drive.

According to the woman's brother, fresh bleach stains were found on the carpet inside the unit leading from the bedroom through the living room and out the front door.

The night of her disappearance, Warner went to dinner with a friend, Scott Russell. He dropped her off at the apartment complex afterward and left. She had not been seen since.
