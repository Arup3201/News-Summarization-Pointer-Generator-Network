House Speaker John Boehner has said today that he ‘can’t imagine’ his conservative views on gay marriage will ever shift, even if he had a son who was gay.

The Ohio Republican told ABC News’ Martha Raddatz for ‘This Week’ that he could not possibly see a situation where his views would change.

Rep. Boehner’s firm stance goes directly against the remarkable about-face of fellow Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman, who publically said he supports gay marriage after his own son came out.

Formed: House Speaker Boehner said today on ABC News' 'This Week' that he 'cant imagine' changing his views on gay marriage

'Change of heart:' A family Christmas card shows Sen. Rob Portman and his wife, Jane, with their children, from left, Jed, 22, Will, 21, and Sally, 18. Sen. Portman announced he would embrace gay marriage in a shocking reversal on the issue

Speaking on ABC News’ ‘This Week,’ Rep. Boehner said: ‘Rob’s a great friend and a long-time ally.’

He went on to explain in the exclusive interview: ‘(But) I believe that marriage is the union of one man and one woman… It’s what I grew up with. It’s what I believe. It’s what my church teaches me.

‘And I can’t imagine that position would ever change.’

Traditional: Boehner, R-Ohio, said he still believes marriage is between a man and a woman

Ms Raddatz pushed the speaker to explore if there ever could be a situation, like that of Sen. Portman, where his views would shift.

‘Listen,’ Rep. Boehner responded. ‘I think that Rob can make up his own mind, take his own position.

'But I’ve made clear my position.’

Sen. Portman, who was on former presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s short list of running mates in the past election, made the surprising announcement on CNN last Thursday, as well as in an op-ed in the Columbus Dispatch.

Doing so made him the first Republican senator to publically embrace the right of same-sex couples to marry.

His son Will, a 21-year-old student at Yale University, came out to him two years ago.

During the interview, Rep Boehner talked about striking a possible ‘grand-bargain,’ a measure to address the $16 trillion in U.S. debt and heralded the president’s recent efforts to promote bi-partisanship.

But in the speaker’s mind, ‘the talk about raising revenue is over,’ adding that President Obama already raised taxes, effective January 1.

‘It’s time to deal with the spending problem’ and address the ‘looming’ debt crisis, he said.

Old pals: When asked if Boehner trusts President Obama, he responded: 'Absolutely'

When Ms Raddatz asked if he trusted the president, Rep. Boehner said: ‘Absolutely.’

‘The president and I, as I have made clear, have a very good relationship,’ he said. ‘We’re open with each other.‘We’re honest with each other. But we’re trying to bridge some big differences.’

During the interview, Rep. Boehner touched upon several other hot-button issues, including gun control, the recent CPAC conference, and the election of Argentinian Pope Francis, the first South American pope in history.
