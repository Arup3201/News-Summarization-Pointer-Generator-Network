Karon Thomas-Larkin has been suspended from teaching after she turned up to lessons drunk

A primary school teacher has been barred from the classroom after she turned up to lessons so drunk she could barely stand up and was unable to get a bus back home. 

Karon Thomas-Larkin, 47, who taught five and six-year-olds at Cwmffrwdoer Primary School in Pontypool, South Wales, smelled 'overbearingly' of alcohol seven times over six weeks.

A disciplinary hearing was told that 13 parents had approached the head teacher with complaints about her behaviour and the fact she smelled of 'stale alcohol'.

Rhiannon Dale, from the General Teaching Council for Wales, said that a learning support assistant had reported smelling alcohol on her breath in the school's tuck shop during morning break.

She told the panel that a month later, the headteacher noted 'an overbearing smell' of alcohol in her office after Ms Thomas-Larkin attended a meeting there.

When confronted by the headteacher, she claimed she had not had a drink since the previous week.

The Year One teacher was sent home three times during October and told not to come back until she was in a fit state.

She returned to school part-time in April 2013 and was told she could go home in the afternoons to plan her lessons.

But on one afternoon Mrs Thomas-Larkin was recognised by two council officers while sitting on a bench, where she had spent more than two hours apparently drunk. 

Ms Dale told the panel: 'She had difficulty walking and standing and was seen staggering across the road.

'She tried to sit down on a bench and fell backwards and tried several times to stand up and fell before she got into the car taking her home.

'She was clearly intoxicated and one of the officials considered she had drunk a large amount of alcohol.'

Mrs Thomas-Larkin, who had been at the school since 2005, was suspended before finally being dismissed in March last year.

The 47-year-old had been a teacher at Cwmffrwdoer Primary School in Pontypool, South Wales since 2005

The hearing was told that she had returned to work after a serious illness where she was treated in intensive care for Legionnaire's disease.

Following her return to work at the beginning of the autumn term in 2012, several teachers and classroom assistants reported smelling alcohol on her clothes and breath.

Ms Dale told the professional conduct hearing in Cardiff: 'She accepts the allegations and admits to unacceptable conduct on seven separate occasions at school.

Colleagues reported they noticed the problem when she returned from work after being treated for Legionnaire's disease in 2012

'She put the safety and well being of her pupils in jeopardy. I don't consider presenting for work still under the influence as setting a good example to pupils.' 

Her union representative David Browne told the private hearing: 'This is a particularly sad case of health issues which had an impact on the set of circumstances.

Committee chairman Steve Powell said: 'Presenting herself at school smelling of alcohol falls seriously short expected of a registered teacher and undermines public trust and confidence in the profession.

'As she admits, she is not yet fully recovered and a period of recovery is required before we can be confident there is no risk of repeat behaviour.' 

Retired teacher Chris Long, who was headteacher at the school for 17 years, said: 'She was a highly efficient teacher, who was keen to take on new responsibilities.

'Her pupils were fond of her and I never received any complaints from parents.'

Mrs Thomas-Larkin was handed a suspension order banning her from teaching for 12 months and requiring her to present a medical report showing she is no longer dependent on alcohol before she can return to the classroom.
