Paul Gascoigne threatened to jump off a pier after being thrown out of a casino in the middle of the night.

The troubled ex-England star told relatives he was going to throw himself into the sea during a tearful phone call in the early hours of Wednesday morning.

Friends and staff from the clinic where Gascoigne is being treated for alcoholism found him wandering near Bournemouth's Boscombe Pier at 4am after his family in Newcastle raised the alarm.

Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne called his family to tell them he was going to throw himself into the sea at Bournemouth

Gascoigne was found by friends and clinic staff wandering near Boscombe Pier at 4am on Wednesday

They took him back to his flat in the seaside town, reports the Sunday Mirror, but he has not been seen since.

Gascoigne, 46, is said to be in the worst physical and mental condition of his life, according to friends.

The former footballer was allegedly asked to leave the casino after becoming abusive.

A friend told the newspaper: 'We want him to ­realise he has one more chance to save himself but it really doesn’t look good.

'Paul called his family in Newcastle and then he called one of his sisters. He was rambling but he mentioned jumping off the pier.

'His family were frantic. They knew they needed to get someone to him quick.'

Friends told the newspaper that Gascoigne has accepted he will end up like George Best, the Manchester United legend who died in 2005 after years of alcoholism.

Earlier this week Gascoigne was taken to hospital after being collapsing outside a London hotel.

He was 'very drunk' and was using crutches to walk before he fell over, witnesses told police.

Reports said he had two bottles of gin and hundreds of pounds in cash on him at the time he was taken ill.

His collapse came only four days after he was arrested for allegedly attacking his ex-wife Sheryl and a train guard in a drunken assault in Stevenage.

He was held in custody for a night before being released on bail the next morning but was later seen swigging gin from the bottle outside a corner shop in Camden, north London.

Five months ago, Gascoigne went to rehab in the United States after being seen drunk and rambling at a public event.

The £100,000 cost of his treatment was funded by celebrity friends including his England colleague Gary Lineker, DJ Chris Evans and Piers Morgan and he was seen with his family in May looking happy and healthy at Windsor Racecourse.

Writing in his column for the Mail on Sunday's Event magazine today, Morgan said: 'We all feel terrible. Not because we wasted our money. We didn’t. We bought him at least a few more months of life.

'No, we feel terrible because Paul is quite obviously so ill that he just can’t stop himself feeding his addiction.

'And it’s highly likely that if he continues the way he’s going, he will die very soon.

'He’s now a desperately lonely, seriously sick man who needs our love, support and help.

After his return from rehab in March, Gascoigne told ITV's Daybreak that he wanted to 'get back to reality' and pledged to stay sober, although he admitted that his alcohol troubles were likely to continue.
