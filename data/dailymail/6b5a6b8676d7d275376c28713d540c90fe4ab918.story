Angry at her Nascar rival for apparently spinning her off the track for a second time in two days, Danica Patrick certainly let Denny Hamlin know about it when she confronted him after a qualifying race.

The pair were involved in a heated argument in which she accused the Joe Gibbs Racing driver of spinning her off the track during the 150 mile race before Sunday's Daytona 500.

Patrick needed to finish 15th or better to guarantee a spot  and managed to come in 10th despite the setback.

A furious Danica Patrick (right) calls out Denny Hamlin after the pair had a coming together during the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Budweiser Duel 2 at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida

Patrick, in car 10, span off track after being sent sideways by the incident with Hamlin seconds before

She was not happy with her fellow driver, telling him straight 'you got on my left rear and spun me out'

Hamlin eventually clasped his head in his hands as Patrick refused to accept his explanation for the spin

But she wasn't about to let Hamlin of the hook as, with cameras rolling, she marches over to Hamlin, grasps him by his race suit and makes her feelings clear in front of dozens of closely packed onlookers post race on Thursday. 

The two had already been involved in an incident in practice the day before where Patrick accused Hamlin of the very same thing.

In yesterday's confrontation over the dangerous high speed smash, she berated him furiously, saying: 'What are you doing, seriously? You did the same thing in practice. 

'You get on my left rear and it spins me out.

'Don't be up my a** on my left corner again.'  

Hamlin replied: 'Nobody has your back like I do but I can't give you an extra two feet because it's you.'

The heated argument continued, with Hamlin try to calm Patrick, who stares him out intensely while he makes his case.

He holds out his hands in a conciliatory gesture and grasps Patrick round the shoulders at times, but there is no placating her and Hamlin finally seems exasperated and covers his face with his hands.

Hamlin tried to tell Patrick the problem was with her car's aerodynamics but sh was having none of it

The spin left Patrick fighting to finish high enough to qualify for the 500, but she still managed to do so

Patrick told Hamlin: 'You did the same thing, nobody else left me with a problem out there' 

'He cut across my rear bumper and pulls the back end around,' Patrick said. 

'I don't want to have these issues, but if we're going to have these issues then we're going to have to deal with them. 

'We can't be putting ourselves out of our race at someone else's expense and nothing's happened to him.'

Tony Stewart, her team co-owner, entered the fray and instructed Hamlin to watch the video.

'What do you want me to do Tony, not race close?' replied Hamlin, adamant that Patrick's car was too loose and he didn't make contact. 

He maintained the spin was caused by aerodynamics, not contact.

'I try to treat everyone as equal,' Hamlin said. 'If you're in this Cup series, you deserved your way here and you can handle a lot of situations. 

'I just got close to her and her car got loose again. I just tried to explain that, "Danica, oh, it's you, I've got to stay away two feet because your car is loose?"

'I guess I just have to give more room because once I get close enough to her, her car just gets out of control.' 

After the crash Patrick's Stewart-Haas Racing team worked frantically on rapid repairs and she restarted 18th with two laps to go. 

She was pushed all the way around Daytona International Speedway by teammate Kurt Busch to finish high enough to make the main event on Sunday.
