Shrinking: Unilever has shrunk cans of deodorant from 150ml to 75ml to make packaging greener

The next time you buy a can of deodorant, don’t worry, you haven’t picked up the travel size by mistake. 

It really is meant to be that small – and it really is exactly the same price as the bigger one.From today, cans of Unilever deodorant, such as Sure and Dove, will be 75ml rather than 150ml.

The firm has shrunk its packaging to make it greener. It claims the new cans will last just as long and deliver the same amount of deodorant as the old ones.

The smaller cans contain less gas and
around a quarter less aluminium, so much less energy is used to make 
them. They also take up less space, so transporting them takes a third 
fewer lorries.  

Unilever 
says its new ‘compressed aerosols’ are a packaging breakthrough, and are
good news for the planet because making and transporting them produces 
fewer carbon emissions.

Of course, they are also good news for Unilever, because its own costs will be reduced – but this saving will not be shared with customers. 

The recommended retail prices of the new smaller cans are exactly the same as the larger originals: £2.19 for Sure, £2.49 for Dove and £1.86 for its Vaseline spray.

It follows a trend of big brands and supermarkets shrinking household name products while keeping the price the same, in what consumer groups claim is an underhand price hike. But Unilever says its changes are not part of the same tactic, as while the can is smaller it will deliver the same number of sprays as its larger predecessor.

The secret to the new cans lies in the nozzle.

First initiative: The company says they are the first to reduce packaging for aerosol deodorants since they were introduced and says the change will help reduce the amount of aluminium it uses by 24 tonnes a year in the UK alone

'Compressed aerosols': Unilever says the secret to the new cans lies in the nozzle

Previously, reducing the amount of gas 
would have resulted in blockages, but the new design prevents this 
happening. The company is so confident in the cans that it is offering 
to give customers their money back if they are not satisfied.

Amanda Sourry, Unilever’s chairman 
for the UK and Ireland, said: ‘Compressed aerosols provide consumers 
with a product that lasts just as long as the previous one, and is more 
sustainable.

'We are confident that this represents the beginning of a 
revolution in deodorants, as people come to see the benefits of this new
packaging.’

The company 
claims this is the first major initiative to reduce  packaging for 
aerosol deodorants since they were introduced, in the late 1960s. 

It
says the change will help reduce the amount of aluminium it uses by 24 
tonnes a year in the UK alone. But the firm defended its decision not to
pass on the savings in materials and transport costs to shoppers, 
saying developing the new cans had been expensive.

A spokesman said: ‘It takes years of 
research and millions of pounds of investment to introduce sustainable 
innovations, such as Compressed, to the market and this investment is 
reflected in the RRP.’
