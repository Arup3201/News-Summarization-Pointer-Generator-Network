Evidence: Police officer David Duckenfield today admitted that he was not qualified to oversee the FA Cup semi-final in April 1989 which ended in tragedy

The most senior police officer on duty during the Hillsborough disaster today apologised and admitted he was 'not the best man' for the task, adding that he was 'learning on the job'.

Former chief superintendent David Duckenfield, the match commander, had little experience of policing football matches and had never been in charge during a game before.

Giving evidence at the inquest into the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans today, he said it was a 'serious mistake' not to consult with his predecessor about the challenges the match would pose, and apologised for 'failings' in the policing of the game.

The supporters were crushed to death shortly after the start of the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough ground on April 15, 1989.

Mr Duckenfield, now 70, was a chief superintendent who was promoted to be head of the local police division two weeks before the game.

He gave the order to open the gates to the ground in the minutes before the crush, allowing 2,000 fans to flood into the ground, and later wrongly claimed that a gate had been forced open.

Speaking at the inquest in Warrington, Cheshire today, Mr Duckenfield was asked whether he had any concerns about his ability to do the job properly given his lack of experience.

The former officer replied: 'All I would say is this, that after a period, I would say, I'm older, hopefully wiser - probably I was not the best man for the job on the day.'

Mr Duckenfield said he had no recent previous experience of policing at Hillsborough before the match and his knowledge of the stadium was 'very general.'

Asked later how familiar he was with the ground, Mr Duckenfield said: 'With hindsight I can almost say, knowing the events of the day, I should've spent the majority of my time as the new commander down there.

'I did in the light of the information available what I considered necessary, and, if there was a failing, well, I apologise.'

The officer agreed that while he had experience of public order policing, that was 'totally different' to policing football matches.

He added: 'At the time I should have thought about my limited knowledge of the role of a commander at a major event that was a sell-out when I had not been in that responsible position previously.'

Mr Duckenfield said that after first joining South Yorkshire Police as a cadet in 1960, he had been 'delighted' to be promoted to the post of chief superintendent of F Division of South Yorkshire Police - including Hillsborough - around March 1989.

The witness told the jury the job came with other major responsibilities, as the area was also home to a major hospital, the local university and areas of affluence and deprivation.

He said, while the semi-final game was 'obviously a major priority', it was only one of the priorities he had to deal with, adding: 'I only had 15 days, and that was not 15 working days.'

Mr Duckenfield said his understanding of the job of the match commander was that he would not be involved in the day-to-day or minute-by-minute duties and would only become on the day if something went wrong.

Christina Lambert QC asked him: 'Did it not occur to you before the match that it was a job that called for deep experience?'

Mr Duckenfield said he had been 'assured' by his boss the chief constable he could rely on the other experienced officers in his team, though he had only had a single brief conversation with his predecessor, Brian Mole.

Miss Lambert asked if he thought it was a mistake to accept the role and 'not seek the assistance from others such as Mr Mole?'

He replied: 'There was a culture in the police service at that time and the culture was you would be moved without any overlap and you would learn, dare I say it, on the job. So it did not cross my mind to say, 'I'm not up to the job.' I just got on with it.'

Miss Lambert continued: 'My question is, in hindsight, was it a mistake?'

The witness replied: 'In hindsight, it was a serious mistake. I did know what the job involved, but no one, including me, knew what might evolve on the day.' 

Crush: 96 Liverpool fans were killed by being pressed up against the ground's perimeter fence

Mr Duckenfield said that it was necessary to keep rival fans apart from each other in order to ensure their safety, pointing to the culture of football hooliganism at the time.

He said: 'The main objectives were safety and I align that with segregation, because if segregation was ensured, then safety usually followed, because of your planning. You can't separate the two.'

Mr Duckenfield said he had experienced hooliganism while working as a inspector at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane ground, adding: 'It was a feature of matches in those days where people fought and argued for whatever reason.

'Those were the challenges that we were facing in the 1970s. It seemed to be very sadly the fact of life that fighting and hooliganism was the main feature of policing football matches.'

Miss Lambert asked him about two pre-match meetings of police officers, dealing with planning ahead of the game.

Mr Duckenfield said the first, on March 22, 1989, was chaired by his predecessor and he 'just sat there and listened'.

He insisted that no minutes were taken of the meeting, and he was not given any notes after the event.

Chaos: Fans flooded onto the pitch in the aftermath of the disaster

Jurors also heard Mr Duckenfield intended to have a day-long 'one-to-one' briefing with Mr Mole before he took over from him as match commander for the 1989 semi-final.

That meeting did not happen as he expected, said Mr Duckenfield, who had heard 'speculation and rumour' that Mr Mole was moved to another post after 'matters of indiscipline' within his division.

He added: 'I went to see Mr Mole, expecting to have a whole day with him, and he seemed, shall we say, in my view, disappointed to be moving, wanting to clear his desk, jealously guarding his relationship with Sheffield Wednesday, and offered me little or no advice.'

Mr Duckenfield told the jury he had not recognised the risk of over-crowding created by the existence of pens on the Leppings Lane terracing.

'I gave no thought to it either way,' he said. 'It wasn't something that came to mind. There was no evidence to suggest from previous events that I should have considered it.'

Mr Duckenfield said he had not realised before the disaster that the lay-out of the Leppings Lane end 'formed something of a bottle-neck'.

Asked who he thought was responsible for monitoring pens to prevent overcrowding, he said that both officers stationed around the stadium and stewards had a role to play.

When Miss Lambert pointed out that the official plan for the game did not ascribe this duty to police, Mr Duckenfield said: 'In a perfect world I would have given certain officers a specific role in that order to do that.'

He admitted that he had a responsibility to monitor overcrowding from the control box, but added: 'I didn't know the difference because of my inexperience of an overcrowded or full pen.'

Campaigners welcomed Mr Duckenfield's appearance at court today.  

Margaret Aspinall, chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, told 5 News: 'It's very, very important because all the families, for 26 years now, have been desperate for Mr Duckenfield to come into an inquest and to answer questions. 

'It was important to find out exactly what his role was and what he did on that day and why 96 people die', she said.

Aspinall added: 'This is what we'd been fighting for for all of these years to get the inquest verdicts quashed because we know they were wrong.' 

The hearing continues tomorrow, when Mr Duckenfield will continue giving evidence.
