Chelsea have added one last stop to their extensive European pre season tour - after confirming an appearance at a charity tournament in Turkey.

The Blues will face Istanbul sides Fenerbache and Besitktas at the Sukru Saracoglu Stadium on May 8 in two 45-minute matches.

The games should give Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho another chance to work out his best XI ahead of the Premier League season, while giving his World Cup stars another chance to impress.

Familiar opposition: Chelsea could come up against Demba Ba

Back in action: Didier Drogba could play in the tournament

Former Blue: Raul Meireles could come up against his old club too

Hosts: Fenerbache's Sukru Saracoglu stadium will host the mini-tournament in August

Task master: Jose Mourinho will get another chance to check on his players' progress in Turkey

And Mourinho's side could come up against some old friends in Turkey: Demba Ba has just left Stamford Bridge to sign for Besiktas, while Fenerbahce boast one-time Blues midfielder Raul Meireles in their ranks.

The tournament has been organised to raise funds for the families of the 301 people killed in May's Soma mining disaster.

An explosion and subsequent fire left 787 workers buried underground leading to a four-day rescue effort and three days of national mourning. It was the worst disaster of its kind in Turkey.

Chance to show class: Cesc Fabregas and Chelsea's other World Cup stars have another chance to play
