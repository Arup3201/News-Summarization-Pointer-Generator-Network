Jeremy Clarkson was saved from losing his job over allegedly saying the N-word by the BBC Director General, reports claim.

Tony Hall overruled director of television Danny Cohen, who allegedly wanted to sack the Top Gear presenter.

Despite mass outrage, Hall handed Clarkson, 54, a 'final warning' after a lengthy meeting to settle the scandal.

Saved: Jeremy Clarkson avoided being sacked thanks to Tony Hall (right) who 'overruled top BBC executives'

Mr Clarkson, shown filming for Top Gear, when it is alleged he used the n-word - a claim he denies

Cohen, renowned for promoting diversity within the corporation, had also pushed for suspension but Hall vetoed, according to The Guardian.

The controversial decision will save the BBC millions by keeping hit show Top Gear, which earns in excess of £150million a year in revenue.

Clarkson became embroiled in controversy after 
unaired footage of him using the nursery rhyme to compare two sports 
cars was leaked to the media.

Historically
 the rhyme was 'Eeny meeny miny mo, catch a n***** by his toe', and 
Clarkson said he 'mumbled' in two takes to avoid using the racist term -
 which made it sound like he was saying it.

In the third, which was broadcast, he said the word 'teacher' instead.

Danny Cohen, the BBC's director of television, allegedly called for Clarkson to be sacked or suspended

It came just weeks after he referred to an Asian man as a 'slope' during an episode of Top Gear.

The star 'begged for forgiveness' after admitting he was 'mortified' at the footage which emerged.

An online petition calling for the BBC presenter to be sacked has reached more than 1,000 signatures.

Labour figures including deputy leader Harriet Harman also demanded he should be sacked.

'Anybody who uses the N-word in public or private in whatever context has no place in the British Broadcasting Corporation,' she wrote on Twitter.

And Labour MP Chris Bryant wrote: 'Clarkson announces he has one last chance. He's been in that saloon so long now he must be hammered.'

But Education Secretary Michael Gove urged the BBC not to axe Clarkson because he had been 'clear in his apology'.

And the Prime Minister appeared to agree. Mr Cameron's official spokesman said: 'He does share the Education Secretary's view: it is absolutely right that there has been an apology.'

Pressed on whether he also shared the view he should keep his job, he replied: 'His view is that in terms of actions and the like, that's for the BBC.'

However, Clarkson has since declared the corporation had forced him to apologise when he did not want to.

He said he will be
 sacked if he ever makes an offensive remark again, admitting 'not even the angel Gabriel' could survive after the threat - especially not a presenter renowned for controversy.

But the presenter compared his apology to saying sorry for starting the Syrian civil war because they were both things he had not done.

A solemn-looking Jeremy Clarkson said the item was recorded a 'couple of years ago' and said he 'did everything in my power to make sure that that version did not appear in the programme that was transmitted'

The decision will save the BBC millions as Top Gear earns in excess of £150million in revenue a year

'I've been told by the BBC that if I make one more offensive remark, anywhere, at any time, I will be sacked,' he wrote.

'And even the angel Gabriel would struggle to survive with that hanging over his head.

'It's inevitable that one day, someone, somewhere will say that I've offended them, and that will be that.'

He also wrote: 'Happily, the BBC had a plan. Unfortunately, it wasn't a very good one.

'An apology is a good idea if you've just spilled some beer down someone's shirt...But saying sorry for using the most racist word of them all, and hoping the story would die down as a result?'

The pressure to apologise even went against the advice of his own lawyer, he claimed.
