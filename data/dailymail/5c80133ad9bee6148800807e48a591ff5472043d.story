Pope Francis sacked the five-man board of the Financial Information 
Authority who were associated with the discredited financial old guard

Pope Francis has sacked the five-man 'old boy network' board of the Vatican's financial watchdog, in the latest bid to break with the discredited old guard, which existed under his predecessor.

The Vatican said the pope chose four experts from Switzerland, Singapore, the United States and Italy to replace the five Italians on the board of the Financial Information Authority (AIF), the Holy See's internal regulatory office.

The new board includes a woman for the first time and has a broad range of international experience.

All five outgoing members, who were laymen associated with the Vatican's old guard, had expected to serve five-year terms until 2016.

The new board includes Marc Odendall, who administers and advises philanthropic organisations in Switzerland, and Juan C. Zarate, a Harvard law professor who is also a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think-tank based in Washington D.C.

The other two board members are Joseph Yuvaraj Pillay, former managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore and senior advisor to the country's president, and Maria Bianca Farina, the head of two Italian insurance companies.

The move comes as reformers inside the Vatican pushed for the pope to appoint professionals with an international background.

They
 wanted the professionals to work with Rene Bruelhart, a Swiss 
lawyer who heads the AIF and has been pushing for change.

Vatican
 sources said Bruelhart, Liechtenstein's former top anti-money 
laundering expert, also wanted Francis to appoint global professionals 
like him to help drive the authority forward.

A Vaatican source said: 'Bruelhart wanted a board he could work 
with and it seems the pope has come down on his side and sent the old 
boy network packing.'

Francis, who was elected in March 2013 after the resignation of former Pope Benedict, has said the finances of the Vatican need to be reformed for the Church to have credibility.

He set up a new Secretariat for the Economy in February, which reports directly to him and appointed an outsider, Australian Cardinal George Pell, to head it.

In another telling move, Sir Francis removed Cardinal Attilio Nicora as president of the AIF in January, despite him having played a senior role in Vatican finances for more than a decade.

He replaced him with an archbishop who has a track record of reform within the Vatican bureaucracy.

He also replaced four of the five cardinals in the commission that supervises the Vatican's troubled bank, known as the Institute for Works of Religion (IOR).

The Vatican announced that four experts from Switzerland, Singapore, the
 US and Italy - including one woman for the first time - would replace 
the five outgoing Italians, who had been due to serve on the board until
 2016

Since the arrival of Bruelhart in 2012, the AIF has been spearheading reforms to bring the Vatican in line with international standards on financial transparency and money laundering.

Pope Francis has already taken steps to clear up Vatican 
finances since he was appointed in March 2013 after the resignation of 
Pope Benedict, above

But Vatican sources say he has encountered resistance from an old, entrenched guard.

A report last December by Moneyval, a monitoring committee of the Council of Europe, said the Vatican had made significant reforms but still had to show more oversight over its bank.

Pope Francis decided against closing the IOR but only on condition that reforms, including closing accounts by people not entitled to have them, continued.

Only Vatican employees, religious institutions, orders of priests and nuns and Catholic charities are allowed to have accounts at the bank.

But investigators have found that a number were being used by outsiders, or that legitimate account holders were handling money for third parties.

Monsignor Nunzio Scarano, a former senior Vatican accountant who had close ties to the IOR, is currently on trial accused of plotting to smuggle millions of dollars into Italy from Switzerland in a scheme to help rich friends avoid taxes.

Scarano has also been indicted on separate charges of laundering millions of euros through the IOR. Paolo Cipriani and Massimo Tulli, the IOR's director and deputy director, who resigned last July after Scarano's arrest, have been ordered to stand trial on charges of violating anti-money laundering norms
