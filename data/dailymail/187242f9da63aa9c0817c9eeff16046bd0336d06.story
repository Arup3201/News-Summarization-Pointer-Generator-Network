No stranger to controversy, the Geelong forward-turned-TV-celebrity has previously attracted attention for views seen as racist and sexist.

However on Thursday night, Newman gave viewers an entirely different view.

Newman's privates have previously featured on The Footy Show at least once, when he was 'dacked' by Shane Crawford in 2001.
