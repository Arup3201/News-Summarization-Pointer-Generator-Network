Charles Saatchi subjected Nigella Lawson to ‘a long summer of bullying and abuse’, she claimed yesterday.

Miss Lawson admitted her ten-year marriage to the businessman may have been doomed from the start. She felt she had to ask permission to do what she wanted, and was ‘punished’ if she displeased him.

Frequently referring to him as Mr Saatchi, she said he had set out to ‘destroy’ her after their divorce in July.  Her experiences with the multi-millionaire art collector were ‘wounding and very difficult’ leaving her with ‘emotional scars’, the jury was told.

Testimony: Nigella Lawson told the jury that 'no one can be in any doubt' her ex-husband Charles Saatchi has a temper

Miss Lawson talked at length about her ex-husband’s irritability saying: ‘Yes, he did have a temper and I don’t think that anyone can be in any doubt he had a temper.’

She added that Elisabetta Grillo, who is on trial along with her sister, may have heard him shouting and swearing – and that Miss Grillo found him so unpleasant she moved out of free accommodation in the family home to be away from him.

At one point Miss Lawson said she confided in Elisabetta, saying: ‘I can’t take this any more.’

Mr Saatchi, she added, did not enjoy family gatherings, and was also bemused as to why the Grillo girls both wanted to be off at the end of December until Miss Lawson ‘explained to him that it was Christmas’.

The couple split in June this year after the infamous picture outside Scott’s which resulted in Mr Saatchi accepting a police caution for assault.

But the ordeal for Miss Lawson did not end there, the court heard.

The TV cook said yesterday that Mr Saatchi – who on Friday told the court he still adored his former wife – begged her to return to the marital home and to clear him of being a wife beater.

She was asked why in October she had threatened to withdraw from giving evidence in the trial – when claims of the Grillo sisters describing her as a drug addict were published on a public relations executive’s internet blog.

Miss Lawson replied: ‘My relations with Mr Saatchi were not good.

‘He said to me that if I didn’t go back to him and clear his name he would destroy me – and also started spreading false allegations of drug use, and in particular that awful incident at Scott’s.

‘I feel his way of getting this out was to use this case.’

She added: ‘Drug allegations came out in September which indirectly Mr Saatchi had menaced me with in August, and I just said, “What drug allegations? There aren’t going to be any”.

‘These allegations appeared in a PR blog that had been dedicated to salvaging Mr Saatchi’s reputation and savaging mine.

‘They had been circulated on the internet and sent to every media outlet.

‘I thought this would not become a fraud case – I would be put on trial and actually that is what has happened.

‘I’m going to have to answer allegations in front of the world’s press – and it comes after a long summer of  bullying and abuse – and I  find it just like another chapter in that.’

She also discussed a venomous email Mr Saatchi sent her in October accusing her of being a drug addict, and revealed what seemed to be long-standing problems.

Denying a suggestion in the email that she had been seeking a ‘pass’ to enjoy all the drugs that she wanted, Miss Lawson said: ‘I had once  made reference to a “pass” because I had been punished for going to my girlfriend’s birthday party.

‘I hasten to say I don’t mean that I was beaten, rather an emotional abuse. It was very wounding and very difficult, and of course we know how things accelerated.’

She then seemed to make the remarkable suggestion that Mr Saatchi may have been secretly colluding with the Grillo girls.

Miss Lawson said: ‘He had, I felt, been in contact with the defendants when he talked to me about drugs in August.

‘I’m not saying he did directly but it seemed he knew about these witness statements before they were published on the internet.’

The celebrity chef then told how her ex-husband in October threatened to sue her for some half a million pounds when she threatened not to give evidence against the Grillos.

Miss Lawson said: ‘It was really just another form of bullying, and making me pay money for legal help.

‘I feel that part of this campaign is to ruin me in whatever way, and if that is financial so be it.

‘He threatens law very often, I’ve seen this in action. I think he likes everyone to do what he wants.

‘It would be, “Get her – I don’t care how much it costs, I don’t care what it takes”. I’m afraid that is how it is now. He feels betrayed by me.’

Miss Lawson said: ‘That marriage was very difficult in very many stages. It was also deeply happy at some stages. This is sometimes the nature of marriages. But this perhaps was doomed.’

In her October statement threatening to withdraw from the case, Miss Lawson had said: ‘I’m of the opinion that Charles Saatchi will do everything he can to damage not just my interests but the interests of my children. The Grillos trial will give him this opportunity.’

Looking at the packed court around her yesterday Miss Lawson added: ‘And look how it’s played out.’
