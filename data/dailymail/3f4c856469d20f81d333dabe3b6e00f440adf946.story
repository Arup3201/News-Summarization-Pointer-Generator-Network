In a tragic turn of events a deaf quadriplegic who found internet fame with his touching, witty Facebook and Twitter posts has died.

24-year-old David Rose captured the hearts of thousands as he took to the web with his seemingly unfaltering positive attitude and love for life despite the odds.

But on Thursday he lost his life-long battle against the severe cerebral palsy he was born with that had committed him to existence in a wheelchair.

He succumbed to pneumonia after being admitted to hospital with a cold late last week.

Ever loyal to his committed followers and friends, David constructed a blog post that he asked his sister, Nicole, to publish in the event that he did not survive the pneumonia.

Heartfelt: David's sister Nicole posted his final blog, as requested by her dying brother

If everything ended up fine, he 
promised, he would 'write a funny new post with lot of boob jokes in it.
 but if i not be around in a week then publish this.'

True to her word Nicole granted her 
brother his final wish, setting live the post, which he had written with
 the same quirky outlook he had become famous for.

'You are all special. all of you 
unique!' he wrote. 'Love each other and make each other smile. a good 
joke is good medicine! make sure everyone around you have a smile ok?

'Always do what is right. always! but
 forgive yourself if you forget sometimes. i have to go now. i love you 
all. i really do. you are amazing. i will never forget you!"

Even gripped by the deadly lung 
complaint, David's signature humour and optimism shone through his posts
 as he blogged from his hospital bed, made possible by the use of a 
specialised compputer which would translate his eye movements, allowing 
him to send out messages at a pace of four words-a-minute.

'First of all want to ask if there is sound in heaven. i guess there is but not sure if i want it!

'Here on earth i been happy to be 
deaf and nobody seem to be very good at describe what is sound, so i 
have not miss it. but i guess if that part of the deal then i have to 
take what i get!

'Say a message for me and maybe i will hear it! or maybe angels know as i bet they do they are pretty smart lol.'

Tragically, David seemed to know what fate lay ahead of him, having lost three cerebral palsy to pneumonia.

'Today I found out i have pneumonia,'
 he wrote on learning of his diagnosis last week. 'It not the nice kind 
either, where you cough for few days then go home and have ice cream.

'It the bad kind where you probably donot go home.'

Upon learning of David's death saddened followers of his social media postings wrote heartfelt tributes to him.

'Goodnight Dave and thank you so much for just being you brother,' commented on Twitter user under the handle @AlbusQ.

Another, @kylielyn, posted a photograph of herself and her daughter blowing a theatrical kiss at the camera, with the words 'for you @daveonwheels'.

'In honor of David Rose, Am going to follow his advice and reach out to someone I haven't in awhile,' wrote @juanmagdaraog.

Many others posted messages with the words 'RIP' and 'goodnight', while the Chive's editor Mac Faulkner wrote: 'We lost a good man today. @daveonwheels you inspired a lot of people and your incredible personality will live on forever.'

Since his family helped set up 
'David's Twitter Machine', to go along with his own blog, David's world 
has got much bigger thanks to virtual friends which stand in admiration 
for his ethics, philosophies and good humour.

The website Chive first brought wider 
attention to David, and said he was the definition of the website's 
state-of-mind: KCCO - Or Keep Calm and Chive On.

David, or Dave, as he likes to be called, lives in a residential home for disabled 
people in Orange County, California, near his mother and his sister.

He communicates with a Tobii eye-gaze computer that tracks his 
eye-movement and posts on Facebook and
 Twitter, and on his blog he says he likes puppies, girls, funny movies, good stories and jokes, and 'yummy food'.

Writing on his blog, David - still writing at a four-word-per-minute pace, left a long answer to questions about his life.

He said: They did not expect me to live past 15 year old because of my severe cerebral palsy.

There are complications, like nasty thing called acid reflux and if i get pneumonia i am gone overnight.

'But i made it past 15, so doctors said i not live past 20. I made it there too.

'I am 24 and the last thing they say is not make it past 25. Why it always have to be nice round number lol. When i go i go and that be it!

'I had two comas so far. Both of them came sudden i was just sitting in wheelchair doing something like am now.

'First time i was watch a tv show.

'2nd time was talking my friend kate on facebook chat. both time aide come in and find me asleep and did not wake up for long time.

'After 2nd coma i had problems I cannot get rid of now. Cannot close my mouth. We work on it in therapy but my mouth stay open all the time it very frustrating.

Dave appreciates the care his family give to him, and amuses followers with stories of their life

Blog: Dave writes articles on his blog at a pace of four words a minute

'I used to be more athetoid. that mean uncontrol moving. was very used to that it been that way since born. after 2nd coma am more spastic.

'That mean less moving and arms and legs more frozen still. I cannot raise my head off wheelchair headrest and my head turn to the right.

'Cannot look straight ahead now or to left. always to right and it stay that way. also very frustrating!

'Why am telling you all this? Not for pity that last thing i want!

Users are sending Dave their own pictures, making virtual friendships over Twitter

'What I want is be accepted like anyone else. I live in place have lot of disable people and most of them not bitter or want pity, they just want do best they can and be like anyone.

'They do not like stares in public. Who does? They not like able body people think they worthless. Who want that?

'The reason tell you this is i maybe not have much time left. Could have coma again before finish write this post and never wake up.

'A few nights ago i lay on my back in bed late at night and choke on something.

'The aide on duty hear me and run in turn me over and clear it. If he not do that i might be gone because cannot turn over myself.

'Because of this and because i might not be here tomorrow then why hate? Why argue and fight? Why be mean and nasty? If someone that way to me I just feel sorry for them.

'They the person who have the worst disability! they not able to love despite bad things and see the good in everything.

I try best to get along good with everyone. I want make people laugh. I want tell people life worth living even when is hard.

'This is why i am how i am. I could leave very soon and not ever come back so I want to leave you, Travis, and everyone else with a smile on you face and nice memory of me.

'And i want you make something of yourself! Do the same and make the whole world better! Too much nasty right now, so lets make some funny and make people laugh before is too late!

'If you all do that because of what i say then i can live on for many years lol. yes in a way it selfish, but i think is better this kind of selfish than someone wanting new car and best house.

'People say i am inspirational. I think i am not, i am just me. i just hope it the best me i can be because i might have to leave soon and there is no second chance. this is it.

'So stop crying stop complaining stop arguing and start laughing. now! does not matter what other people do. it only matter what you do.'
