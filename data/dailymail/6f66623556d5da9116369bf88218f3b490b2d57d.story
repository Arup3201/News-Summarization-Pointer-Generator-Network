A scorned woman falsely labelled a businessman whom she'd had a brief relationship with as a 'paedophile' and 'charity thief' on social media then called his friends to tell them he had hanged himself.

Donna Fraser, 39, of Drumchapel, Glasgow, met Paul Anderson, 41, through a dating website in June 2013 and then asked him to move in with her.

But when he had 'doubts' and declined, she then bombarded him with up to 50 text messages a day, Stirling Sheriff Court heard today.

She then sent a message that she had set up a Facebook account saying that Mr Anderson was a paedophile.

Fraser also admitted she put a picture on Google Plus saying he was a sex predator, a charity thief, and alleging he was 'screwing the social security'.

She also phoned two of his friends posing as 'Joanne from Dunfermline' telling them Mr Anderson had hanged himself.

Adrian Fraser, prosecuting, said after Mr Anderson told Fraser, on August 5, that he was not moving in, the texts landed day and night, until Mr Anderson changed his number.

After a lull she texted him again, accusing him of being a paedophile.

Using a sim card she had stolen from him, she sent him pictures from his old mobile phone.

The depute fiscal said: 'One of the messages was a photo of a female at an auction, and she threatened to send it to all his contacts saying he was a paedophile. She believed the female was 16, but she was in her late 20s.

'She texted: 'You say you’re not a paedophile - who is this, then, you pervert?'

'She also sent a message saying she had set up a Facebook account saying he was a paedophile.

The court was told Fraser was receiving help from her GP and she was made the subject to a two-year non-harassament order

'Paul Anderson showed Paul Mears and Margaret Johnstone a photo of him on Facebook where she had put ‘Paedophile’.

'In the course of a later interview with police... she denied referring to him as a paedophile but did say he was a sex predator, and also said she put a picture on Google Plus saying he was a sex predator, a charity thief, and was screwing the social security.'

The court was also told Fraser said she would contact auctions where Mr Anderson did business, and threatened to ruin him.

One of his friends received texts from Fraser saying he 'stole charity tins from pubs' and made the calls to his friends saying he had hanged himself.,

She also repeatedly made telephone calls to his neighbours.

On September 11 last year, after she phoned an auction house he was attending and said: 'It’s Donna. You better watch your back as  I’m going to get you killed', Mr Anderson contacted police.

The fiscal added: 'As a result of the accused’s conduct Mr Anderson lost friends, became concerned about speaking to people he knew, and felt he was being stalked.

'On one occasion he took a panic attack.'

The court was told that during Fraser’s campaign of harassment, Mr Anderson’s father, who knew what his son was going though, died. Fraser was eventually arrested on September 17.

Mr Fraser added: 'In the course of a later interview she seemed to be angry, upset, and wanted to be in a relationship with the accused.

'She said she was in love with him and he was wrong to have ended it. She denied referring to him as a paedophile but did say he was a sex predator.'

Fraser pleaded guilty to engaging in a course of conduct between August 5 and September 17 2013 which caused fear and alarm to Mr Anderson of Buchlyvie, Stirlingshire.

Virgil Crawford, defending, said that Fraser was receiving help from her GP.

She was made the subject to a two-year non-harassament order, banning her from contacting or communicating with Mr Anderson or his friends and neighbours involved in the case, or posting or publishing any information about him or photographs of him.

Sheriff William Gilchrist told her: 'If you break the order you’ll be committing another crime.'

A spokesman for Sir James Stirling’s Garden Estate at Buchlyvie, where Mr Anderson had a flat, said today: 'He lived here for over 18 months, but he vanished about three months ago.

'He was a very pleasant chap.We liked him because he was as quiet as a mouse.

'Before he left there were lots of police here, so we assumed he’d had some sort of trouble.'
