In world full of social networks and connections made here, there and everywhere with people in a virtual world, the term 'friend' is used a lot.

But despite having more than 300 Facebook friends, British women can count their true friends on one just hand.

That's according to a new survey which quizzed women between the ages of 18 and 35 years.

They may have on average 338 Facebook friends but researchers found that the average number of true friends came out at just five, with some women admitting they have only one and others claiming to have up to 12.

True friends were classed as those you'd turn to in an emergency, friends you can talk to about anything and those that support and love you regardless of the situation.

The qualities the respondents looked for in them included loyalty, being trustworthy, honest, discreet, reliable and someone like-minded. 

All those qualities were chosen by at least 90 per cent of the women when they were asked to pick out the attributes that made up a true friend.

Almost three quarters of the women, 74 per cent, had a true friend they had grown up with, while 67 per cent had met at school or university.

Almost half, 46 per cent, had met a true friend at work, while a third, 33 per cent, had done so through a shared interest and 29 per cent said they had met a true friend through their children. 

One respondent said: 'I grew up with one of my oldest friends and despite living in different parts of the country, we're still really close.

'I speak to her a couple of times a week and we're texting all the time. I don't know what I'd do without her. She's always there when I need her - whether that's a shoulder to cry on or someone to laugh with.'

Another added: 'My circle of true friends has got larger as I've got older, but there's a couple that I've known since I was at school and they're always the first people I call on for anything. They probably know more about me than my mum and certainly more than my other half. I'd be lost without them.'

A third said: 'I'd count my hubby as one of my true friends. I share everything with him - we have no secrets - and he knows as much about me as any of my girlfriends. He's not as good as gossiping as them though. I rely on the girls for that.'

A spokesperson for money saving site FreeDeliveryLand.co.uk, who commissioned the research, said: 'It's interesting to see that despite most of us having hundreds of Facebook friends, we class very few of these as our true friends.

'It's always reassuring to know that you have friends you can rely on, friends who will support you whatever the situation and those you can turn to for a good cry or to share the high points with.

'The shared experiences you have certainly cement the friendship and make it one to value.'
