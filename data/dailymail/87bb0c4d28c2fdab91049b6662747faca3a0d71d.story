A carrier pigeon that delivered the crucial first SOS message which relayed the news that the British forces at the Battle of Arnhem were in trouble is to be honoured at an exhibition next week.

Three days into the daring battle which, if it had succeeded, would have brought World War Two to an end by Christmas 1944, the desperate troops sent the carrier pigeon named William of Orange back home as a last-ditch attempt to make contact after their radios failed.

An exhibition on January 18-19 in Blackpool will celebrate all 32 carrier pigeons that won the prestigious Dickin Medal - the animal equivalent of the Victoria Cross.

William of Orange brought back the first message from the Allied troops who were under fire at the Battle of Anherm

William of Orange did his duty to the Allied forces efficiently, flying the 260 miles back to its loft in Knutsford, Cheshire in just four hours and 25 minutes.

The note attached to William's foot relayed the message to the British authorities that the Paratroopers at Arnhem Bridge were cut off and in desperate need of airborne support if they were to fight the German forces.

General manager of the Royal Racing Pigeon Association, Stewart Wardrop, said William's story deserved recognition.

He said: 'William of Orange isn’t as well known as other pigeons that won the Dickin Medal but his story is quite remarkable.

'It took William four hours and 25 minutes to fly 260 miles back to Britain which was a record.

'When you consider he would have been cooped up in a cage for days and then released under fire by the Germans and then flew over 135 miles of open water with no navigation points and still returned home, it was quite an achievement.

'Sadly he did not arrive home in time to save the men who were overcome by the Germans over the next two days.'

William nearly didn't get home at all, as at first he proved reluctant to leave the men at the battle.

While under fire, two soldiers tried to launch the bird off from one of the bridges on the Dutch/German border, but it refused to budge.

The Battle of Arnhem was known at the time as Operation Market Garden.

It was one of the boldest plans of World War Two and, if it had succeeded, would have ensured the war ended by Christmas 1944.

30,000 British and American airborne troops were to be flown behind enemy lines in September 1944 to capture the eight bridges that spanned the Dutch German border.

British tanks and infantry were to meet the airborne troops at the bridges and cross them.

The plan was conceived after the D-Day landings in June 1944 by General Bernard Montgomery, commander of the British forces in Europe.

Over three days, the Allied airborne forces tried to parachute in, while tanks and infantry made their way to the bridges.

They were surrounded by German troops and were eventually forced to fight their way out.

1,984 British soldiers were killed and 6,854 captured - a disastrous defeat for the Allied Forces.

German artillery controlled the river only 2,500 British soldiers made it out alive.

It would be another four months before the Allies crossed the Rhine again in early 1945.

The war dragged on for another seven months until September 1945.

It was only when one of the soldiers fired his Sten gun into the air the pigeon was spooked and flew off into the night.

William had been trained for this mission by the National Pigeon Service and assigned to the Royal Corps of Signals.

He was given to the service by his owner Sir William Proctor Smith in 1942.

For Operation Market Garden he was selected to accompany Two Para, commanded by Major John Frost, who was played by Anthony Hopkins in the epic 1977 film 'A Bridge Too Far'.

William of Orange was awarded the Dickin medal in 1945 - the 21st animal to win it.

The award is the animal equivalent of the Victoria Cross and was set up in 1943 by Maria Dickin, who was the founder of the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals.

William was eventually brought out of service by his owner for the considerable sum of £135 (now £3,500) and lived for another 10 years.

Buster, a springer spaniel, received the Dickin Medal for locating a weapons arsenal in Safwan, Southern Iraq in March 2003.

Theo was a springer spaniel who located 
improvised explosive devices while serving in Afghanistan in 2012. He 
holds the record (14) for most operational finds by an arms and 
explosives search dog. He died from a seizure just after his handler, 
Lance Corporal Liam Lasker, was killed by enemy fire.

Simon was a cat who received the prestigious medal for her role in a naval siege which cost the lives of 17 British sailors in 1949. He continued to dispose of the rats on HMS Amethyst despite being injured.
