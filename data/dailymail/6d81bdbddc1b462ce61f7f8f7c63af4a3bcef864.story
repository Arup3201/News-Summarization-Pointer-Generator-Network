A professional rugby league player who famously lost a testicle during a match earlier this year has left his wife and two children for a porn star, it was reported today.

Warrington Wolves prop Paul Wood was apparently seen moving his belongings into the flat of Holly Henderson, who used to date Manchester City footballer Mario Balotelli.

The 31-year-old was said to have told his wife of six years Shelley that he was leaving her on the day after Boxing Day, it was reported in The Sun.

Providing the muscle: The pair were pictured together over the weekend after Wood reportedly told his wife he was leaving the day after Booxing Day

Mrs Wood is believed to have been in tears as he left after visiting their children - George, four, and Darcey, 20 months - on Saturday.

A family friend told the paper: ‘How Paul could walk away from his wife and two kids at Christmas is staggering.

‘No one can believe he’s left the woman he’s loved for so long for a porn star.'

Last night, Wood said his marriage ended before he started seeing Miss Henderson, 34, and did not leave his wife for the glamour model. But he declined to say when he started seeing her.

He has not yet responded to comment from MailOnline for a request to comment.

The rugby star suffered a ruptured 
testicle after being kneed in the groin by Leeds Rhino player Kallum 
Watkins during the Super League Grand Final in October.

Dating: The pair got together two months ago while he was recovering from his horrific injury and have been seen in bars in Stockton Heath in Warrington, Cheshire, according to The Sun

Tight-lipped: Miss Henderson, pictured on her Twitter account, confirmed today that she was 'romantically linked' to the Warrington Wolves prop, but declined to comment further

Glamour model: Mother-of-two Miss Henderson has appeared on porn channel Bluebird TV and starred in Channel 4 reality show Sex, Lies and Rinsing Guys

Remarkably, he played on for 40 minutes before calmly heading off to hospital to have it surgically removed.

The Sun claims Wood met up with Holly, a mother-of-two who has appeared on porn channel Bluebird TV, after flirting on Twitter.

They
got together two months ago while he was recovering from his horrific 
injury and have been seen in bars in Stockton Heath in Warrington, 
Cheshire, according to the paper.

Miss
Henderson confirmed today that she was 'romantically linked' to the 
Warrington Wolves prop, but declined to comment further.

A
spokesman for her publicists Earth Horse PR said: 'She requests that 
any further press inquiries are left to after the festive season is over
to limit the distress caused to Paul's family's at this difficult 
time.'

On her Twitter account today, a user told her: 'love u to babe u n paul r lush love how happy u are x'

To which, she replied: 'only get 1 life ay x'. She told another poster: 'thanks hunny, we're happy xxx'.

Pain barrier: Wood 
carried on playing for 40minutes after being kneed in the groin during the Super League Grand Final (above) in October, an injury that meant he needed to have his testicle surgically removed

Finding fame: Miss Henderson, 34, has previously dated Manchester City striker Mario Balotelli (right)

Mrs Wood has also declined to comment.

Miss Henderson - real name Jeanette Worthington - found fame after she started seeing Balotelli, 22, and went on to star on Channel 4 reality show Sex, Lies & Rinsing Guys, where glamorous girls use their charm, beauty and glamour to get ‘gifts’ from men.

She also claims to be related to Manchester United and England striker Wayne Rooney, but has not not elaborated on the family connection.

Speaking after the 26-18 defeat to Leeds at Old Trafford, Wood was able to see the funny side of his injury.

Referring to his team-mates, he previously said: ‘I know they’ll be taking the mickey.

‘Even when I was in hospital (on the night of the match) they were sending me texts saying: “You worked your b***s off tonight!” Lucky I’ve got a sense of humour.’
