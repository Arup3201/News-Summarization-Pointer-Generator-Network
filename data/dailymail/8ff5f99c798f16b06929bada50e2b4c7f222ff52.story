A slaughterhouse boss has become the first person to plead guilty over the horse meat scandal that rocket British supermarkets last year.

Peter Boddy, 65, who runs West Yorkshire slaughterhouse in Todmorden admitted failing to comply with food traceability regulations in court today.

A jury heard he sold 50 horses for meat in 2012 but failed to keep proper records to show where the meat had ended up.

There was no suggestion that buyers had been falsely sold the product as horse meat, however, prosecutors confirmed they did not know what shops or food vendors the meat had been sent to.

Boddy appeared at Southwark Crown Court today where he spoke only to confirm his name and the guilty plea.

His colleague and co-defendant, slaughterhouse manager David Moss also stood in the dock.

He denied forging an invoice in February 2013 in Boddy’s name concerning the number of horses sold in a transaction.

The pair are accused of failing to abide by EU meat traceability regulations in relation to horses, which state the source of meat should be traceable from field to fork.

Both men are also charged with failing to comply with food traceability requirements for more than 17 horse carcases between July 2012 and February 2013.

However neither entered pleas and intend to apply for the charge to be dismissed.

In a second trial minutes later, slaughterhouse bosses Dafydd Raw-Rees, 66 and Colin Patterson, 43, from Wales, answered separate charges in a catalogue of food-labelling failures.

Their company, Farmbox Meats Limited, allegedly sold goat meat to unwitting customers as ‘lamb trim’ and ‘lamb shanks’.

Raw-Rees and Patterson, who worked at Tyne Parc, Llandre in Dyfed, are also accused of processing horse carcasses, without regard for traceability guidelines.

They denied 19 counts of selling falsely labelled goat meat.

Farmbox Meats Limited is believed to have gone into administration and no longer operating.

Supermarket giant Asda withdrew its 500g Beef Bolognese Sauce, left, from sale after tests indicated the presence of horse DNA. Its 600g Beef Broth Soup, right, was also withdrawn as a precaution in February 2013

Meat from French food company Spanghero found its way into Findus beef lasagne in Britain last year

In September last year, the Food Standards Agency issued a recall notice for all frozen lamb, beef and mutton trim supplied by the firm.

Prosecutor Adam Payter said both cases concern alleged criminal offences discovered as a consequence of the investigation into the horse meat scandal in January 2011.

‘It is not clear where some of the horse meat they processed ended up’, Mr Payter said.

An application to transfer the two cases, which are expected to be heard separately, was rejected today.

Both trials will be heard at Southwark Crown Court at a date yet to be set.

Both pairs will reappear in a second trial due to be heard at Southwark Crown Court at a date yet to be set
