Wounded: John Wood shows off his battle wounds after he fought off four would-be muggers who stabbed him with a screwdriver in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire

A pub landlord managed to fight off four would-be muggers who attacked him as he left a fish and chip shop - while holding his dinner in one hand.

John Wood, 37, was even stabbed in the stomach with a sharpened screwdriver as he bravely fought off the gang, but amazingly his fish supper still made it home in one piece.

Mr Wood, a pub landlord from Cambridgeshire, put martial arts training from when he was a teenager into good use to fend off his attackers.

He said: 'I only did aikido for a couple of years but it all comes back to you very quickly when you need it most.

'The men stopped me and demanded my phone and wallet. I told them that if they wanted it they'd have to come and get it.

'They all came at me at once, I kicked two of them in the leg.

'I used to do a little bit of aikido and I remembered to go for the knees. They fell to the floor and couldn't get up.

'As I did that another clipped me in the face.

'I turned around and hit him and he fell. I turned around again and the other one came at me with what I thought was a knife.

'He just lunged and I felt a sharp twang in my side. I grabbed his hands so he couldn't bring it out and stab again.

'I pulled it out myself, disarmed him and then hit him. I think he was knocked out.

'Then I just got in my car and left, I didn't even drop the chips.'

Mr Wood, who owns the Marshland Arms, in Marshland St James close to Wisbech where the attack happened, coolly drove back to fiance Claire Upton's house with their food.

Scene: The incident happened shortly after Mr Wood left Frank's Fish & Chip shop in Wisbech

When his wound wouldn't stop bleeding, Mr Wood went to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn several hours later where he needed 15 internal and three external stitches.

Medics believe that his injuries were inflicted with a sharpened screwdriver.

Mr Wood said: 'The screwdriver deflected off my ribs apparently, it was a millimetre away from going into my lung.

If it had gone through that it would have hit my liver, I was very lucky.

'If it had been a couple of inches over it could have been me lying in the alleyway.

'I dread to think what would have happened if it was somebody else in that situation.

'My fiancee was going to go for the fish and chips but I said it was too dangerous.

'I would never have forgiven myself if I had let her go and she'd been attacked.'

According to fiancee Claire, Mr Wood looked as though nothing had happened when he returned to the house.

She said: 'It was a crazy moment when he walked in.

'His face was a bit red where he had been hit and so we were looking for a plaster, then we served the chips.

'John had lost his appetite but the pie he got is still in the fridge.

'We haven't had the heart to throw it out seeing as he worked so hard for it!'

Cambridgeshire Police said that they are investigating the incident.
