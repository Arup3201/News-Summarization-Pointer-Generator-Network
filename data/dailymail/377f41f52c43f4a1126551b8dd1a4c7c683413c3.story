In what some would call an unlucky outcome a man has lost the right to part of his former wife's $6 million lotto winnings from five years ago.

The court battle over the cash has been dragged out over the past two years, but this month it was determined the man was not entitled to any of his ex-wife's money.

Mr Eufrosin - the name he and his ex-wife were given for legal reasons - already had his claim denied in May last year but this month the panel rejected it for the second time, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.

The decision went to a three-judge bench from the NSW Family Court, who discovered the golden ticket was purchased six months after the couple had split.

A court has ruled that a man has no entitlement to his ex-wife's $6 million lottery winnings 

Mrs Eufrosin had been buying lotto tickets for years before she was married, and bought the one that would win her $6 million while on holidays.

Each week her sister reportedly gave her money to put towards the cash pool, and so got a cool $1 million share in the cash when Mrs Eufrosin won.

The case was denied on the basis that it could not be proven the purchase of the ticket came from joint funds solely related to the couple's income, as other contributors were Mrs Eufrosin's sister and also a family company.

Mrs Eufrosin, given that name for legal reasons, purchased the ticket six months after the separation

Justice Janet Stevenson 'The money used by the wife to purchase the winning ticket could have come from any one of these sources or multiple combinations thereof.'

'In my view, the husband cannot simply assert that the purchase money came from "joint funds",' she added when speaking in May last year.

 Mr Eufrosin launched an appeal against the Family Court - but was dismissed by the bench made up of Justices Stephen Thackray, Peter Murphy and Murray Aldridge

The man was also ordered to pay his ex-wife's legal fees.
