World No 1 golfer Rory McIlroy is set to be personally dragged into his multi-million pound lawsuit with management agents Horizon Sports for the first time.

Although European Ryder Cup team talisman McIIroy has been in dispute with Horizon since April 2013, he has been kept at arm’s length from the legal battle to extricate him from a representative contract running until the end of 2017, by his lawyers.

However, the mediation between the two sides — which the Dublin judge has ordered to take place within 28 days after a preliminary hearing — would require Mcllroy, as the plaintiff, to be there in person for negotiations.

The next step is likely to be an application for a mediation time extension as McIlroy’s involvement in the Ryder Cup and next week’s Dunhill Links championship allows little opportunity for talks to be staged.

But with the Dublin High Court trial date set for next February, it would suit both sides for a settlement to be agreed. McIlroy, despite being such an assured 25-year-old, would hate being cross-examined by a leading QC.

Horizon chief Conor Ridge would not want to subject his other big golf client Graeme McDowell to such an experience, either.

If it does go to court, McIlroy could be faced with a bill for as much as £40million.

Di Dougherty, who didn’t have the best of times as host of the opening ceremony at Celtic Manor, has nevertheless kept the role at Gleneagles. And although Di no longer presents golf on Sky, her husband Nick is a pundit on Sky’s Ryder Cup highlights programmes while fighting to resurrect his playing career.

Tom Watson, 65-year-old US captain, does not like questions about his age or his Ryder Cup credentials

Ryder Cup organisers’ guests at Gleneagles include Premier League chief executive Richard Sdudamore who was also invited to Medinah in 2012. And certainly — with the next PL TV tender looming — Sky’s main rights competitors BT Sport will be reassured Scudamore is not enjoying Sky’s hospitality at a tournament where they are omnipresent from overlord Barney Francis downwards. Scudamore says he will be declaring the trip on the PL entertainment register. Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has been feted at Gleneagles as a motivational speaker to Paul McGinley’s side — but his sworn enemy JP McManus is on the European Tour VIP invite guest list.

Tom Watson, 65-year-old US captain, does not like questions about his age or being reminded that he hasn’t been present at a Ryder Cup for 21 years. When asked yesterday whether that was a disadvantage, Watson’s cold answer was just ‘No’ before adding: ‘Because I’ve played four times and I’ve been captain once. That’s experience.’ However, rival Paul McGinley calls his inside involvement in the most recent tournaments a ‘massive learning curve.’

Kevin Pietersen failed to mention Jaguar's cancelled sponsorship of the England  team was partly due to him

England cricket outcast Kevin Pietersen has been tweeting more about golf than cricket, especially about playing at Wentworth. Certainly, KP would find becoming a member at European Tour headquarters Wentworth rather easier than at nearby Sunningdale, where arch-foe Andrew Strauss plays his golf. However, Pietersen did tweet yesterday that Jaguar were ending their England cricket sponsorship — as revealed last summer by Sports Agenda. But KP didn’t say that one of the reasons why the endorsement ended was his refusal to drive a Jaguar when on international duty.

The battle for Ryder Cup prominence between warring watch brands Rolex and Omega is complicated by Rolex–backed Europe’s top player Rory McIlroy being a leading ambassador for Omega. They are official timekeepers for the US team. The size of McIlroy’s Omega contract, which includes a heavy advertising campaign on American TV, ensures he will be wearing their watch when off the course at Gleneagles.

Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond might have lost the referendum vote, but he is credited by the European Tour hierarchy with doing more than anyone to bring the Ryder Cup to Scotland. A Scottish Government reception at Stirling Castle on Saturday is likely to turn into a tribute night for the departing First Minister.
