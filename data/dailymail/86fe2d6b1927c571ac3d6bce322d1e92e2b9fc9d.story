Leicester manager Nigel Pearson has vowed not to 'park the bus' against Chelsea on Saturday as he relishes testing his side against Jose Mourinho's title favourites.

Last season's Championship winners will look to build on an opening-day draw with Everton when they go to west London this weekend.

Pearson accepts any kind of result they can get will be a bonus and therefore hopes his side can play with a degree of freedom.

Tactics: Nigel Pearson says he will not park the bus against Chelsea in the Premier League this weekend 

'I'm looking forward to taking Leicester City to Chelsea in the league rather than the cup,' said Pearson, whose side lost 5-2 in an FA Cup quarter-final in 2012.

'The most important thing is I want to see how our players cope with a big fixture. It's important for us to play the game and not the occasion.

'Chelsea at Stamford Bridge speaks for itself. Their record there is very good but we have to think of this as something of a bonus.

'Not many people give us much hope but we have a strong resolve. If we can be an awkward customer I'll be happy. But we have some good footballers.

Confidence: Pearson insisted his team had some strong players and could be an 'awkward customer'

'We may be need a bit of time for our players to dictate the tempo a bit better. There are a lot of counter-attacking sides in the Premier League.

'I don't want us to just soak pressure. We need to give each other enough options to maximise our offensive players. We have some threats.'

While Pearson may be intrigued to pit his side against the Blues, he has less interest in his own 'battle' with Mourinho.

'I have a huge respect for Jose,' he said. 'I don't see it as a duel between managers. I see it as about how to be competitive as a team. How others want to bill it is up to them.'

Respect: Pearson said he has 'huge respect' for the Chelsea manager as the two sides prepare to meet

Pearson, who may be able to welcome back Jamie Vardy (thigh) and Marc Albrighton (groin) for the match, insists his job has barely changed since reaching the top flight.

'It feels like it always does,' he said. 'I'm managing the same people. The problems and challenges are different but it is all about managing the expectations in terms of excitement generated. It's been a long time since we were in the Premier League.

'It's important for people to enjoy the experience but we will only do that by performing as well as we can.

'I don't see my job to be fundamentally different. I'm very pleased to be the manager of a side that has achieved promotion with style.

'It's not an easy thing to do and for us to establish ourselves as a Premier League side it will take a lot of hard work and patience.'
