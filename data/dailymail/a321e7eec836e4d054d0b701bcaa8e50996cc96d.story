A 54-year-old woman was charged early on Sunday morning at a domestic violence shelter after pushing over a pregnant woman and kung-fu chopping an employee.

Christi Louise O’Connor, a resident of Palm Coast, Florida, was charged with both battery, and aggravated battery on a pregnant woman following the fight, originally about Christmas ornaments.

FlaglerLive.com reported that O’Connor removed ornaments from the tree at the shelter in Bunnell, Florida.

She argued with the pregnant woman before pushing her to the ground and slapping and hitting her arm.

When asked to leave the Family Life Center facility, O’Connor refused.

When asked again, she allegedly began packing a laptop computer belonging to the shelter.

Some witnesses claimed that she was using the computer despite being asked not to by the employee, whose name was redacted from the police report.

O'Connor became physically violent after being repeatedly asked to stop using the laptop.

She then called the employee a racial slur before striking her with a kung-fu chop.

FlaglerLive stated that witnesses at the shelter claimed that O’Connor had been manipulating people at the facility for two to three days.

They also reported that the incident had been particularly disturbing for children housed there as they were there to get away from scenes of domestic violence.

As of Monday afternoon, O’Connor was booked into the Flagler County Detention Facility and was being held on two $250 bonds, one for each charge.

In October O'Connor was booked for trespass after warning.
