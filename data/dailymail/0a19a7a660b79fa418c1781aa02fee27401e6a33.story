John Barnes has backed Brendan Rodgers to bring Liverpool back into the fight for a Champions League place, despite the fact last season's runners-up are currently languishing in 11th.

The pressure on Rodgers after Liverpool's stuttering start to the season intensified after they were emphatically beaten 3-0 by Manchester United on Sunday, but Barnes believes Rodgers is the right man to inspire a revival at Anfield.

'The criticism of Brendan has been unfair, of course it has,' Barnes said to City A.M.

'Liverpool aren’t doing as well as last year or as well as they should, but why all of a sudden are a lot of people jumping on his back and saying he shouldn’t be in a job?

'I never got carried away last year insisting he was the best manager in the world and now he’s not the worst manager in the world. He is a very good manager and can make Liverpool successful once again.' 

But Barnes believes that if Liverpool do not enjoy an upward turn of form by the end of the season, the situation should be reviewed.

'How long has he got? We should wait until the end of the season and see what happens. Liverpool are still in cup competitions and could still qualify for the Champions League,' Barnes said. 

Rodgers has a chance to haul his team back into contention for the top four when they take on Arsenal at Anfield on Sunday, who they trail by five points.
