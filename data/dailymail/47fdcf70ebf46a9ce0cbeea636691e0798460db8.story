The public release of a video showing football star Ray Rice punching his now-wife in an Atlantic City elevator may have led to the termination of his contract with the Baltimore Ravens and an indefinite suspension from the NFL, but the disgraced athlete still has plenty of fans.

And shockingly, a good number of those fans still supporting Rice are female.

Bring him back: Many feel that Rice's punishment was too harsh

Ravens fans were out in full force this evening as the team took on the Pittsburgh Steelers at M&T Bank Stadium, in Baltimore, Maryland, and there were plenty of people wearing Ray Rice jerseys, and happy to explain why they still support the team's former running back.

'There's two sides to every story,' said Bailey, a 23-year-old waitress from Baltimore who was wearing a black, rhinestone-decorated jersey with the white No. 27. 

'I saw the video. That's their personal business, and it shouldn't have affected his career. I don't agree with domestic violence, but she's still with him, so obviously it wasn't that big of a deal. Everyone should just drop it.'

The team, meanwhile, has started a Ray Rice Jersey Exchange policy, allowing fans to trade in their Rice jersey for another player on the Ravens.

They will also no longer be selling ray Rice jerseys. 

Return policy: Fans can exchange their Rice jerseys for any other player the team has announced, though it does not appear Karla Owens (above) will be doing that

Not everyone is a fan: One woman started screaming at someone wearing the Rice jersey, 'You support a wife beater!'

Player no more: Rice had his contract with the Ravens terminated, and has been suspended from the NFL

It seems, however, that more than a few fans will be wearing their Rice jersey until it is in tatters.

'I took the bus here, so people were, like, "Good, I'm glad to see to someone out here showing support,"' said Gage Friend, 18,  of wearing his Rice jersey.

'But I've also seen a lot of people giving me dirty looks and people saying stuff to me like, "I can't believe you'd wear that. Don't you know what he did?"'

The teenager added, 'Yeah, I'm pretty aware of what he did. And, yes, it was awful and it was definitely a mistake on his part, but he deserves a second chance. ... People have done so much worse in this league.'

Not a fan: One person taped over his Rice jersey, writing Mike Tyson over his name

Stand by your man: Rice fans filled the stands

At least one fan was not fond of the jerseys though, screaming at one person wearing the white No. 27, 'You support a wife-beater!'
