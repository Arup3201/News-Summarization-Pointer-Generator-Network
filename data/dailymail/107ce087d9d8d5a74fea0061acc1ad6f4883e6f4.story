Moors murderer Ian Brady has bragged he is as notorious as Jack the Ripper and Britain was 'obsessed' with the way he tortured, sexually abused and murdered five children.

In a four-hour self serving rant yesterday, Brady said he is still famous for 'theatrical reasons' because he buried bodies on the moors, drawing comparisons to Emily Brontë's 'Wuthering Heights and all that'.

The 75-year-child killer then complained to 
his Manchester mental health tribunal that since he was jailed for life 
in 1966 he felt like a 'monkey in a cage being poked with a stick'.

'Why are they [the public] still 
talking about Jack the Ripper, after a century? Because of the dramatic 
background, the fog, cobbled streets,' he said.

'Mine's the same... Wuthering Heights, Hound Of The Baskervilles.'

Self-obsessed: Moors murderer Ian Brady (left yesterday and right in 1966) boasted that he was as notorious as Jack the Ripper because of his terrible crimes

Not once did he mention his poor victims, but when pressed on the five child murders he 
committed with Myra Hindley, he described himself as a 
‘petty criminal’ in comparison with Tony Blair, whom he accused of 
‘minting a fortune from his war crimes’.

Drama: Brady claimed the 'theatrical' elements of Jack the Ripper, like the fog and cobbled streets, meant his moors murders were just as notorious

In his soft Glaswegian accent, he described the notorious 1960s killings as ‘recreational’ and an ‘existential experience’.

The notorious criminal, who wants to be sent back to prison from Ashworth secure hospital, won the right to have a mental health tribunal held in public at an estimated cost of £250,000.

He wants to be judged ‘sane’ to be allowed to be transferred from secure hospital to a jail. Indeed, he yesterday said he was simply ‘method acting’ at the time he was diagnosed as mentally ill.

It came as Brady’s taxpayer-funded opportunity to 
present his twisted view of the world was yesterday condemned as an 
‘immoral farce’ by families of his victims.

Relatives of the victims watching proceedings – relayed by video from the Merseyside hospital to a Manchester courtroom – waited in vain for any signs of remorse. One described the event as ‘the Brady Show’ while another said it was an insult to those he killed.

Brady, a diagnosed narcissist, regaled the hearing with boasts about his days in a maximum security prison with the Kray twins, IRA killers and Great Train Robbers.

Seizing the opportunity of being heard in public for the first time since his jailing in 1966, he delivered four hours of rambling, paranoia-filled testimony and accused the public of being obsessed with him.

Not once did he mention any of those he killed. Claiming that he was the real victim, Brady – who has fought for a public hearing over the state of his mental health for a decade – complained that the public and media remained as ‘obsessed’ with his crimes as with Jack the Ripper’s.

Victims: Keith Bennett, whose body has never 
been recovered, left, and John Kilbride, right, were two of the 
youngsters killed by Moors murderer Ian Brady during the 1960s

Lured to their deaths: Brady and his partner 
Myra Hindley killed Edward Evans, left, in October 1965. Pauline Reade, 
right, 16, disappeared on her 
way to a disco on July 12, 1963

‘It fascinates them because of the 
dramatic background – fog, capes, cobbled streets,’ he said. ‘The Moors 
is the same thing. Wuthering Heights and all that, The Hound of the 
Baskervilles ...’

He denied that talking to himself is 
evidence of schizophrenia, asking ‘Who doesn’t?’ and criticised the 
psychiatrists who had tried to treat him, saying: ‘They’re worse than 
the patients.’

Myra Hindley, Brady's partner, who was convicted alongside him for the killings. She died in 2002, aged 60, still a prisoner

Brady said Ashworth had been ‘decent and progressive’ when he arrived in 1985 but had become a ‘penal warehouse’ by 1999 when he was forcibly moved to a ward for those with severe personality disorders – the ‘catalyst’ for his subsequent hunger strike.

In a convoluted explanation of why he claims to be sane, Brady said that if he were to claim he ‘recreationally killed’, that would seem to be evidence of madness, but that if he knew precisely what he meant, ‘therefore I’m not mad’.

Terry West, the older brother of Lesley Ann Downey, who was murdered at the age of ten in 1964, said: ‘This hearing is a farce and it only serves to cause more grief for the families of the victims.

‘I think it is appalling that the public should have to pay for this hearing when all it is designed to do is put him back in the public eye.’

Terry Kilbride, whose brother John, 
12, was murdered by Brady and Hindley in 1963, said the pair’s five 
victims had been forgotten and the hearing was ‘a total sham’.

Mr
Kilbride, 59, said it was ‘shocking and immoral’ that the money had 
been spent fulfilling Brady’s demands instead of a new hunt for the 
remains of 12-year-old Keith Bennett, which have never been found.

Keith’s mother, Winnie Johnson, had pledged to attend the hearing to ‘look Brady in the eye’ and demand he finally divulge their whereabouts, but she died last year aged 78.

Brady denied the account of nurses that he secretly supplemented force-feeding with soup and toast or that he had tried to stab one with a pen last September.

He insisted he would be able to cope with the stricter regime of prison, saying that instead of reacting to provocation ‘I then pick up the pen and do the damage by writing immediately to the right people on the outside’.

Brady has been incarcerated at the secure hospital since 1985 and on 'hunger strike' since 1999

 'Why
are they still talking about Jack the Ripper after a century? Because 
of the dramatic background, the fog, cobbled streets. The Moors is the 
same... Wuthering Heights, Hound Of The Baskervilles

I was pretending to be insane when I arrived at Ashworth. Have you never heard of method acting?

What value did I get from killing? Existential experience.

Some of these psychiatrists, - I would throw a net over them. They're worse than the patients.'

Pressed repeatedly on whether he would starve himself to death if allowed back to prison, he hinted that he would, saying: ‘After 50 years I’ve had enough. I’m simply saying, “Keep it, keep the rest, I’m going now”.’ He added that were his force-feeding to continue in prison, ‘I then have another plan in mind’.

Brady said he had ‘no ambitions’ for the future: ‘I know that I am in until death. I have known from day one that I’m finished.’

Judge Robert Atherton, chairing the panel, opened proceedings by acknowledging relatives’ anger but insisting the tribunal’s job was to focus on Brady’s mental health, not his crimes. However he and fellow panel members pressed Brady about his murders, asking if they were not evidence of an abnormal mind.

Brady said that were he an outside observer, he would ‘immediately’ say such a person was ‘mad’ and an ‘extreme danger’, but then went on to suggest politicians and soldiers committed more serious crimes.

Following his evidence, Dr Kevin Gournay, a consultant psychologist called in support of Brady’s claim, told the hearing the killer had been ‘evasive in the extreme’. Brady’s legal team have argued he has severe personality disorders but is not mentally ill and could be treated in prison rather than hospital.

But expert psychologists called by Ashworth say Brady is a chronically ill paranoid schizophrenic who should remain at the hospital.

The hearing continues.
