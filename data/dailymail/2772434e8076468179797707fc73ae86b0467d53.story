A teen whose boyfriend stabbed her father to death said she was 'glad' he was dead and wished her dad's girlfriend had been murdered too, a forensic psychiatrist testified in court Wednesday.

Morgan Lane Arnold, now-16, was in a state of active psychosis when she made the remarks about her father, Dennis Lane, Dr Neil Blumberg said, according to The Baltimore Sun.

'I'm glad he's dead,' Arnold said at one point after she was arrested, according to records read aloud by Blumberg, a witness in her defense, in Howard County Circuit Court.

'My fantasy came true. He disappeared,' she apparently said.

Arnold is accused of asking her then-boyfriend, Jason Bulmer, to kill her father. She was 14 at the time of the killing and was charged as an adult with first-degree murder and other counts.

Victim: Dennis Lane was stabbed to death in his home by Bulmer in May 2013

However, her lawyers are now trying to get her case transferred to the juvenile system and Wednesday was the second day of testimony.

Arnold and Bulmer were described as misfits who had an obsession with fantasy characters.

Testimony focused on the teen's mental health history, revealing that she has been diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, anxiety, schizoaffective disorder, and Asperger's at various points in her life.

According to The Baltimore Sun, mental health experts said Arnold regularly talked of a character named 'Nymeria' whom she said awoke within her and took over her body.

Nymeria is the name of a wolf character on 'Game of Thrones.'

Blumberg testified that the appearance of Nymeria suggested Arnold suffered hallucinations. However, other psychiatrists disagreed.

Adolescent psychologist Kiu Eubanks told the court that Arnold is intellectually 'slow,' with her psychological age somewhere between 9 and 12.

Arrest: Jason Bulmer was 19 and Morgan Lane Arnold was 14 when they were charged with murder

The hearing is scheduled to continue August 6.

In
 deciding whether she should be tried as a juvenile, Judge William 
Tucker will take into consideration the girl's health, whether she has 
the potential for rehabilitation, and whether she poses a risk to the 
public.

In February, 20-year-old Bulmer pleaded guilty to murdering Lane because Arnold was 'sick of him'.

Bulmer
 admitted stabbing the businessman and blogger several times with a 
kitchen knife at the family's Ellicott City home last May.

The court heard that Bulmer and his victim's daughter had been planning the killing on Skype for nearly two months.

At his hearing, Bulmer, who was sentenced to 30 years in prison in May, made no statements and only answered direct questions.

Assistant state attorney, Danielle DuClaux gave an account of the murder, which took place at about 4am on May 10 last year.

Crime scene: Arnold is said to have left a door unlocked so Bulmer could slip into her home and kill her father

She read out conversations between 
Bulmer and his teenage girlfriend, who is awaiting trial on five counts 
including murder, conspiracy and solicitation of murder.

According to DuClax, Bulmer told police that his girlfriend had told him to kill her father, the Baltimore Sun reported. 

He had also planned to kill Mr Lane's fiancée, Denise Geiger, who was in the house and called police as Bulmer began his attack.

Charging
 documents show that Bulmer claimed he was instructed by his girlfriend 
to stab her father in the throat 10 times with a kitchen carving knife, 
and Ms Geiger in the throat 15 times with the same weapon.

When detectives asked why Miss Geiger was to be stabbed five times more , Bulmer, who was only in the 10th grade, told detectives that Arnold had said: 'I have my reasons, and I'll tell you later.'

Bulmer was instructed to bring his own knife to the house, which Arnold, who has Asperger's syndrome and anxiety disorders, shared with her dad and Miss Geiger.

He sent his younger girlfriend a photo of a kitchen knife in a text message, checking for her approval, charging documents showed.

She replied in such a way that 'indicated to Bulmer that this knife was satisfactory,' according to the charging documents.

She sent a further message to say she would leave the door unlocked and
 Bulmer let her know when he was getting close to the home.

After the killing Bulmer had planned to flee to California with Morgan, who has special needs.

The students, who both attended the same school, had met through online gaming. Arnold's anxiety had led her to retreat to online fantasy games, where she could control her interaction with others.

'Her electronic communication devices were her world,' her mother, Cindi Arnold, told the Baltimore Sun shortly after the murder.

She said her daughter suffered from anxiety, which would cause her hair to fall out, and said that when the teenager was nervous she would growl and make animal sounds. 

Arnold had been having treatment, but it
 was stopped after her parents separated and began a custody battle, as 
they disagreed over the best way to raise their daughter.

Mr Lane had struggled to accept his daughter's autism diagnosis, and believed his daughter needed more socialization, according to records.

He 'expects more of Mogan in terms of emotional sturdiness' a report by Dr Cynthia Wilcox had stated.

A sentencing hearing for Bulmer is due to take place on May 29. Arnold is still awaiting a court date and will be tried as an adult despite her special needs.
