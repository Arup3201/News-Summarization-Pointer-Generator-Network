A group of curious sea lions were so eager to be captured on camera they sized up the photographer and grabbed at his camera just as he was taking the perfect shot of them.

Richard Salas from Santa Barbara, California took the up close and personal images of the creatures while diving near Hornby Island in Canada.

Mr Salas specialises in underwater photography and used specially adapted lighting and a camera as well as his diving expertise to get the pictures of the Stellar Sea Lions.

But despite the creatures playing rough, Mr Salas was able to capture this shot after the sea lion pushed his face against his camera lens

And with the animals not frightened to be the centre of attention, Mr Salas had to contend with them nudging him and trying to bite his equipment as he took his images.

But despite the tussle, he managed to snap some up close shots as the sea lions pushed their faces up against his camera lens.

The father-of-one said: 'Photographing the sea lions was like playing rugby underwater.

'Just when I thought I had the perfect shot, one of the sea lions would come round and move my strobes around and be sizing up my head with its mouth. It was very exciting.

'I enjoy 
photographing nature because it allows me to introduce these animals and
 places to people who will never get to see them up close and personal.

'Informing
 viewers in a beautiful way about their importance in the balance of our
 beloved planet. And how we can help them which ultimately helps us.

'I
 use my lights and patience to create different dimensions in my 
photographs of these sea lions so that they leap off the page to greet 
the viewer.'

Mr Salas says he is passionate about taking underwater shots of sea life so the viewer can connect with the animals and fish, which live in the the depths of the sea.

He added: 'I am committed to using my art and technique to spark in others both a reverence and a sense of responsibility for the ocean and its creatures.

'Through photography I expose viewers to new ways of connecting to the underwater world and its inhabitants so that they, like me, may feel the heartbeat of our precious sea life.'
