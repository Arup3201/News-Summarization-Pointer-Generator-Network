The wonderful Estadio Do Dragao has two huge gaps between the seats and the roof behind each goal.

Porto have learned that it is useless to try and keep prying eyes out. Every summer, as the transfer window opens, the dragon's lair is raided.

Giants from all over Europe come ashore at this Atlantic port with their treasure chests of booty, eager to snatch the latest talent off the conveyor belt.

Last year it was Manchester City, who prised away the prized assets of Eliaquim Mangala and Fernando.

Before that, Zenit St Petersburg swiped Hulk. Atletico Madrid made off with James Rodriguez and Radamel Falcao. The list goes on.

Left to pick up the pieces this season has been Julen Lopetegui Argote, a man who has coached Spain's Under 19s, 20s and 21s.

It has not been easy. While a 1-1 draw at Basel put them in the box seat for the last eight of the Champions League, before kick-off here on a rainy, foggy night, the hated Benfica were almost out of sight in Primeira Liga.

Seven points clear, anything other than victory over their third-placed Lisbon rivals Sporting would put Porto's domestic season in danger of ending in March.

Not that Argote is criticised. A perceived establishment bias towards Benfica is bemoaned, with talk of a season blighted by refereeing injustices.

Tello, on loan from Barcelona, completed his hat-trick in the second-half to keep Porto close to Benfica

Inevitably, it was a man widely thought to be the next out of the door who unlocked Sporting's defence.

There seemed to be little danger in a tight contest when the ball bounced towards Arsenal and Manchester United target Jackson Martinez just inside the opposition half on 31 minutes. The 28-year-old, with his back to goal, calmly chested it down before volleying an audacious backheel over his shoulder and over the retreating green and white wall.

Barcelona loanee Cristian Tello was perhaps the only person in the stadium who saw it coming. He raced through a static defence, latched onto the flick and cooly slotted past Rui Patricio to ease the tension amid the crowd of 43,111.

United may be wary of Colombian strikers approaching 30, but in an instant Martinez displayed a vision rarely seen at Old Trafford this season.

After the break the pair of them were at it again, although this time it was more orthodox. Martinez's sidefooted through ball found his teammate in space and Tello, ousted by Neymar at the Nou Camp, finished emphatically into the roof of Patricio's net.

On 83 minutes Tello had his hat-trick. This time Mexican Hector Herrera provided the assist as he beat the offside trap once more before another sidefoot past Patricio's outstretched arms.

Tello is approaching the halfway mark of a two-year loan deal. Many more performances like this and he may well have scouts returning down the well-trodden path to Porto.

The home side, however, are not the only ones susceptible to Europe's cash-rich big guns. At Porto's wonderful year-old museum (complete with statues of Bobby Robson, Mourinho and Andre Villas-Boas) visitors are informed that it took 12,000 tons of iron and 90,200 cubic metres of concrete to build Estadio Do Dragao.

They may have used something similar to put together Sporting's man-mountain William Carvalho. The 22-year-old defensive midfielder is also said to be wanted by United and Arsenal but here he was often outshone by the crafty Yacine Brahimi. The Algerian international, replaced by ex-Chelsea flatterer to deceive Ricardo Quaresma, is rumoured to have interested City and on the evidence of this display Manuel Pellegrini may soon be back here.

For the visitors, United outcast Nani will have been relishing the opportunity to give a UK audience watching on ESPN a reminder of his talents.

He scored a 35-yard volley last weekend which he celebrated with tears. There was more sadness here.

Isolated on the left he did little to show why Louis van Gaal should change his opinion on a night when others jostled for places at the checkout of Europe's supermarket.

Porto's noisy fans unfurled a giant banner before the game depicting one of their supporters elbowing a Benfica fan out of the way underneath the European Cup while a pot-bellied Sporting follower looked on uninterested.

They clearly take solace in the fact they are the only Portuguese side left in the Champions League but after this routine victory they should not give up hope on domestic glory. 

BT Sport shows multiple live games from Portugal’s Primeira Liga every week as part of a European football line-up including UEFA Europa League, Germany’s Bundesliga, France’s Ligue 1 and Italy’s Serie A.
