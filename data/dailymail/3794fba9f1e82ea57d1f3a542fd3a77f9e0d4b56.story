 

Katy Perry's spectacular halftime show at the Super Bowl has been somewhat overshadowed by her unusual choice in backing dancers.

The two dancers dressed in shark costumes have won their own league of fans after their awkward moves and depressed expressions went viral.

Perry's performance of her hits California Girls and Teenage Dreams saw her appear with dancing palms, beach balls, surf board and sharks. 

On Monday, dancer Bryan Gaw came forward to admit he was the shark on the left - posting a picture saying 'Yep. The rumors are true. Yours truly.'

While fellow dancer Scott Myrick said he was the shark on the right, adding that he had only one minute and 30 seconds to change into the costume.

However, the shark costumes did not lend themselves very well to dancing, which saw the two dancers making stilted, flailing moves.

While Scott was on the right, at one point during the performance Bryan appeared to lose track of the choreography leaving it out of time with him.

But Scott told how manic the show was, writing on reddit: 'Yes I was the shark!!!!!! I dance for Katy on her prismatic world tour and have been with her for 5 years! I danced as a gingerbread man in her first tour the California dreams tour. And also her big purple cat, kitty purry.

'I was actually a horse chest piece in dark horse and had to change into the shark costume in 1:30 seconds. It was nuts!' 

He said the 'visibility was terrible...I ran into a palm tree but the camera missed', adding: 'This is just another day in KP land' 

Twitter was quick to pick up on the hilarious mistake, with Left Shark getting its own account.

One user tweeted: 'The left side dancing shark that couldn't get the dance moves right won the night tho...'

Another wrote: 'Everyone's all upset over the game and I'm still laughing over the left shark who didn't know his dance moves.'

Nazi sharks?:  Katy made good on her promise earlier in the week to have sharks and tigers in her show but some thought the sharks were making Nazi salutes

'Highlight of the Super Bowl - the half-arsed, uncoordinated shark on the left,' tweeted another.

User sallyjayjohnson wrote: 'Aspirations: Shark on the Right. Reality: Shark on the Left'

Online sports network SBNation added: 'Shout-out to Left Shark for just making up his choreography on the spot.'

Tweeter ctanwalton admitted: 'I know about as much about this accounting hmwk as @leftshark knew his @katyperry choreography #SuperBowl'

The expressions on the 'shark faces' have also been ridiculed online, as they ranged from sad, angry, shocked and downright depressed as they danced on stage.

The hilarious costumes have become an internet hit, with a Vine showing the dancer's awkward moves being seen more than nearly 6.5million times so far. 

The 30-year-old pop superstar started her 12-minute performance with a dramatic entrance wearing a red and yellow flaming dress and riding atop a mechanised tiger. 

Her fiery outfit earned quick comparisons online to the late US professional wrestler Bam Bam Bigelow who wore outfits with hot-rod style flames along with a large flame tattoo on his head.

Skating costume: Katy's outfit also was compared to the ice dancing costume seen in Blades Of Glory

Others promptly pointed out that Katy resembled Chester Cheetah - the official mascot for Cheetos snacks.

Her entrance to others also evoked memories of Peter Griffin riding a lion in an episode of the animated comedy The Family Guy.

Some also thought the outfit was similar to the ice skating costume worn by Will Ferrell in his 2007 comedy Blades Of Glory. 

Yet others thought the dress was reminiscent of Jennifer Lawrence's flaming gown that she wore as Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games.

Katy next belted out her hit song Roar while riding atop the gigantic cat on the floor of University Of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, California.

The brunette beauty after singing Dark Horse introduced 50-year-old rocker Lenny Kravitz for a duet of I Kissed A Girl with flames erupting in the background.

Katy changed outfits for her next song Teenage Dream that featured toothy beach balls and the now infamous dancing sharks.

Katy busted out California Gurls in the same outfit before changing into an all-black ensemble for her duet with Missy Elliott.

She switched into a silver dress adorned with stars for her final song Firework that featured her singing while flying high above the stadium floor as pyrotechnics sparkled behind her.

Commenters on the Internet noted that Katy as she flew threw the air resembled NBC's logo for its The More You Know series of public service announcements.

Katy, real name Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson, earlier on Sunday shared a throwback photo of herself as a child and dedicated her performance to her younger self.

'Today is for this girl. She had the dream, always believed in herself & her worth. Today she is the one smiling,' Katy tweeted.

The New England Patriots beat the Seattle Seahawks 28-24.
