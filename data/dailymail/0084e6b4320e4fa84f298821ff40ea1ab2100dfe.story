There are a lot of things that 3-year-old Beckett Roerdink could ask for on his birthday — chief among them a miracle for the incurable cancer he's battled since doctors found a tumor lodged in his tiny brain.

But there is only one thing the Wisconsin boy wants when he blows out his candles this coming Wednesday: lots of letters.

'He loves mail, so any time he gets mail he gets super excited,' mother Melanie Roerdink, of Greenville, told the Appleton Post-Crescent.

Last year, Beckett's parents thought he might not make it to his next birthday. He turns four on Wednesday, Sept. 17

Beckett, 3, is a bright little boy who loves getting mail. He's hoping for lots of letters when he turns 4 years old on Wednesday

Birthday letters for little Beckett, who turns four on Wednesday, Sept. 17, should be sent to:

'It would just be so awesome if he would 
just get a bunch of cards for his birthday,' the mother told the Post-Crescent.

Roerdink's nightmare began in April 2013, when an MRI revealed that Beckett had a large tumor growing in his brain.

Days later, doctors removed the tumor in two separate surgeries, but he was left paralyzed but for his left hand, the Post-Crescent reported.

But the side effects have taken a toll on the family: Beckett was left paralyzed but for his left hand.

He has been in speech and physical therapy ever since, learning to walk and talk while he tries to adapt to life in preschool.

'We look at everything differently,' 
Roerdink said. 'We pretty much live one day at a time and feel beyond 
blessed. We see things in a whole different light.'

Beckett now wears an eye patch for a few hours each day due to nerve damage from the surgery and his balance is a bit off, the Post-Crescent reported.

He also has to make constant trips to Texas for further testing and has MRIs every three months to check for recurring tumors.

Sure, every kids likes toys. But this year, all that Beckett wants is letters in the mail

Through it all, the little Wisconsin boy remains a real trooper.

'Beckett is the sweetest, most 
patient boy,' Roerdink told the Post-Crescent. 'You can't not love him.

'Everyone loves him. He's real 
easygoing but maybe because he's had no other choice."

The ordeal has taken a huge emotional and financial on the family, so they're happy for a chance to celebrate.

'Milestones are huge because we didn't even think that we would get through surgery,' Roerdink told the Post-Crescent. 'We have to do something to celebrate because it's a big deal.'

Beckett's parents have established a page for those wishing to follow his progress and donate to help with medical expenses. That site can be found here. 

September is national Childhood Cancer Awareness Month.

'I only have one true wish and that's they find a cure, the mother told the newspaper. 'And I hope he has many more birthdays.'

Beckett is still struggling to walk and talk like most little boys his age, but he doesn't give up easily
