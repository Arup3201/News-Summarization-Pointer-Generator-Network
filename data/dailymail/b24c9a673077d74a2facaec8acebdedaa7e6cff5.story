Marouane Fellaini is determined to win a place in Manchester United's new all-star line-up after escaping the axe at Old Trafford.

Fellaini was rumoured to be on a hit-list of players being offloaded by Louis van Gaal this summer, just 12 months after joining United from Everton for £27.5million, and was strongly linked with a move to Napoli.

However, it is understood Van Gaal has told the Belgium midfielder that he could still have a future at the club and will be in contention for a place once he recovers from an ankle injury.

Fellaini, who only made 15 starts in all competitions in his first season at Old Trafford, believes he can break into the first-team despite United's £150m summer spend on new players including midfielders Ander Herrera and Daley Blind.

In a television interview in Belgium, Fellaini said: 'I want to fight for my place. The coach wants to play with the 11 players who make the best team – I want to be part of that.'

Meanwhile, the 26-year-old was at the centre of a mystery in his homeland during the international break when it was suggested that United had barred him from attending a family day organised by the Belgium coach Marc Wilmots after the Euro 2016 qualifier against Israel was postponed. Fellaini then turned up at a similar event at his old club Standard Liege.

However, it emerged that Wilmots had not notified Fellaini because he assumed United would block the invitation due to the player's injury.
