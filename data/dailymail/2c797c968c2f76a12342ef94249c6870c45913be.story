The heavens may have opened but the band kept on playing as the Queen threw her home open for a garden party today.

Around 8,000 members of the public, dressed in their summer finery, milled around on the lawn at Buckingham Palace as members of the Royal Family, including the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, the Earl and the Countess of Wessex and the Duke of Kent, prepared to greet guests.

As the royal party, led by the Queen, trooped outside for the National Anthem, however, they were engulfed in a torrent of rain.

Ever prepared, the royal puts up her Fulton umbrella as the rain began to fall during the celebrations

The royal, dressed in the same design she wore to the wedding of William and Kate, clasped her coordinating  see-through umbrella as she toured the party - which was attended by 8,000 members of the public

The Queen, who was wearing the same primrose Angela Kelly-designed outfit that she wore to Prince William's wedding, glanced up at the sky, put up her see-through Fulton umbrella and stoically carried on shaking hands.

Lulled by earlier sunshine, however, many of those who attended had left their brollies at home, leaving them dripping wet as they exchanged small talk with the sovereign and her family.

Richard and Jenny Morton from the Isles of Scilly shared a joke with the Queen about the sudden downpour that left guests sodden.

But the husband and wife were left dripping with rain as they kept their umbrella shut until the Queen had moved on to chat to other guests.

The royal stoically continued on her official duties this afternoon despite a bout of rainfall

Laughing: The Duke of Edinburgh didn't let the poor weather put a dampener on the event - laughing with guests

Relaxed: The Prince of Wales looked relaxed - and dry - as he toured the gardens during the sodden event

Mrs Morton, 59, a teacher from the settlement of Higher Town on the island of St Martin's said: 'This is the first time we've been to London in 40 years. We told the Queen this and she said "you haven't chosen a very nice day".'

Â Trish Spiers from Winchester, who had been invited to the annual summer gathering as she was recently awarded the BEM - British Empire Medal - for her community work, also spoke to the Queen.

The monarch was particularly interested to hear of her work with the Almshouse of St Cross in Winchester where she had planted a tree some 25 years earlier.

Mrs Spiers said she told the Queen that her tree was still going strong.

Too tall? The Duchess of Cornwall sported a similar umbrella to the Queen as she tried to shelter a guest

Prince Philip laughed and joked with numerous attendees from the relative safety of his umbrella

Prince Charles chatted with two party guests - who looked a little damp having forgotten their umbrellas

The Countess of Wessex smiled for the cameras at the annual event

'She told me she was fascinated to hear that as she often never got to hear what happened to all the trees she planted,' she said.

Prince Charles made a beeline for Bruce Jackman, a former Brigadier with the 2nd Gurkhas, whom he met on a official visit to the regiment in Hong Kong in 1980.

'He arrived late at night having just come from the opera in his black tie. He piloted the helicopter himself, landing on the airfield in the pitch black with just our Land Rover headlights to mark the way. It was like something out of a James Bond film, ' he recalled.

The royal later chatted with other party-goers - one of whom sported a fashionable red umbrella

Not deterred by a bit of wet weather, Princess Alexandra met with guests at the palace

Thankfully, the rain eventually subsided while a selection of bands continued to play a medley of tunes

He said afterwards: 'We were told he would just go straight to bed but went to the mess, ordered a whisky and talked to every soldier he could. He was so easy-going, charming and genuinely interested in what they were doing.

'He made a beeline for me and said how nice it was to see me again.'

After chatting to several hundred of their guests the royal party headed into the royal tea tent as the bands of the Blues and Royals and the Irish Guards continued to play a medley of cheery tunes.
