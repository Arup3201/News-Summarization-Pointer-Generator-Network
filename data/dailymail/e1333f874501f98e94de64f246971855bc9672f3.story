Stop the clock, Andy Carroll has scored. But would Sam Allardyce turn back time if he could?

It’s certainly a question he could answer with a little more authority now than Friday morning when, with a straight face, he claimed he was confident Carroll would ultimately prove he was right to snub Wilfried Bony.

Of course, it came down to a straight choice between the two strikers in the summer of 2013 - an Ivorian playing in Holland and the big man who had just spent a good loan spell at the club. Allardyce went for Carroll, backed him in his press conference last week and would have been oblivious to the Twitter sniggering that accompanied Bony’s first-half opener here.

But Carroll has always leant himself to a good narrative. Perhaps it was poetic that he would respond in the manner he did, with two magnificent headers. There are no graces in those kind of goals and few mysteries. But surely there is beauty - and certainly great credit - in something so predictable being so hard to defend against? Swansea made it look impossible.

His first goal, after 41 minutes, ended a stretch 797 minutes without a goal. Another statistic showed he had not scored at Upton Park since March 2013. These numbers are always at the ready with Carroll; there’s always a rod to beat him with. His second sent West Ham third in the table.

But what of the original question? Where would West Ham be if Allardyce took a chance on the Ivorian, £3m less at £12m and so prolific at Vitesse Arnhem?

Perhaps Allardyce should have known better than to even enter the discussion on Friday.

Having already explained that it was a straight choice between signing Carroll and Bony, he was asked if he believed the choice he made would ultimately be vindicated.

‘I think so,’ he said. ‘Hopefully, in the end, it will be an Andy that is not picking up injuries and starts getting back to what we know he can do. His first season in the Premier League at Newcastle showed at that young age he was a massive goal-scoring threat against anyone.

‘He has done it before. Because of the injuries he had that career hasn’t blossomed as it should have done. If he gets a run without injuries, we are in for a player of his capabilities.’

Sadly, it is rare these days for discussions surrounding Carroll to move beyond talk of injuries and what might be. There are hopes and possibilities and fleeting moments - like his performance here and the brilliant comeback cameo against Aston Villa on November 8 - when it is possible to wonder how much he will offer when he is fully fit.

But so little of the dialogue concerns the here and now. And it is on those terms that a comparison to Bony is so hopelessly skewed in the Ivorian’s favour, even when the immediacy of this result has faded. Allardyce couldn’t possibly admit any regrets for fear of sabotaging himself, but one must wonder.

The truth is that Bony has proven himself wonderfully effective. And where he really differs from Carroll is that he is a player who has sustained a level of goal-scoring brilliance that Carroll has not matched. He has 19 goals in the calendar year – more than anyone in the Premier League. He has also scored seven in his past nine Premier League fixtures after 25 in all competitions in his debut campaign.

Whatever way you cut it, his goals have been a consistent factor in Swansea’s performances. Not bad for a striker who cost an initial £12m, has rarely broken down injured and last month signed a new contract until 2018. More still, the contract extension is understood to have addressed the release clause that might have seen him leave for £19m in the summer, when Liverpool were most prominent among his admirers.

And Carroll? He has now scored three goals in the time Bony has scored 33. On that scale, the winner is obvious. It is also fair to say Bony is more accomplished on the ground, even if it is hard to blame Carroll for West Ham's habit of going long when he is on the pitch.

But, as always, there is hope that this young English talent will enjoy the kind of run of good health that has so far eluded him. With any luck, he can take the strides that Allardyce expects of him.
