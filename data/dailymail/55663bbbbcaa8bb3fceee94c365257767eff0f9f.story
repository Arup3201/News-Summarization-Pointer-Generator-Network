Move over Movember. There's a new facial hair fundraising initiative in town.

Beard Baubles have hit the mainstream, becoming one of the biggest fashion accessories of the season and even making an appearance at the World Darts Championship.

The multi-coloured festive baubles, which attach gently to facial hair, are popping up on beards all over the world, from the UK to Australia.

One man - 22-year-old Callum Storey, from Sevenoaks, Kent, - even flaunted his Beard Baubles at the William Hill World Darts Championship at Alexandra Palace in north London last night.

The multi-coloured festive Beard Baubles, which attach to facial hair, are popping up on beards all over the world, including Callum Storey, 22, who sported them at the World Darts Championship in London last night

He could be seen with an array of the tiny ornaments nestled in his facial hair, as he sipped a pint and watched the likes of Mervyn King and Max Hopp compete.

The baubles are the brainchild of creative agency Grey London, situated in the Farringdon area of the capital.

The agency set up a partnership with Jimmy Niggles, the founder of Beard Season - an initiative to raise awareness for skin cancer by encouraging men to grow their beard during the month of December.

Much like Movember, when men are encouraged to grow a moustache while raising money for prostate cancer, testicular cancer and mental health issues, Beard Season aims to raise awareness of melanoma.

All proceeds from Grey London's Yuletide facial hair accessory – which cost £5 for a pack of 14 – go to the charity.

Mr Storey, who recently resigned from his job as a headhunter to return to university to study a master's degree in finance, said he strongly supported the Beard Season campaign. 

He said: 'I had a cancer in my foot when I was 14, so I support all the drives like this and get involved because it raises awareness.

'I had a really rare tumour and had to have my big toe amputated on my left foot. I was in remission until two or three years ago and then I got the all clear.'

He said he started growing his beard on September 29 and now hopes to continue growing it long into the new year.

‘There’s nothing to lose getting involved in these things, I like growing a full beard,’ he said.

‘You can raise money for charity, but even if you don’t, you’re still raising awareness.

‘If people can relate, then it’s always good.’

Mr Storey, who will begin his master’s degree at Nottingham Trent University in January, said he chose to wear the facial baubles as part of his fancy dress, but also to raise awareness of Beard Season.

He said: ‘Last night was the first time I’ve worn them. A few people came up to me and asked for my picture and everyone wanted to touch them.’

Grey London said Beard Baubles have been so popular, flying off shelves from the UK to Australia, that they had now sold out.

Ollie Dearn, who works at the agency, said: 'The product has been particularly popular with Brits.

'We've sold more than we ever expected.

'But Aussie, American, Kiwis, German and French customers have been purchasing Beard Baubles too.'

Each pack contains 14 multi-coloured baubles to attach to beard bristles - ten large balls and four small ones.

The success of the product grew after Grey London decided to feature the facial hair accessory in their annual Christmas cards to clients.

Mr Dearn said: 'Each year, Grey London makes a Christmas card to send out to clients and other agencies.

Grey London has teamed up with Beard Season, an initiative which aims to raise awareness of skin cancer. They money from each bag of the multi-coloured baubles sold goes to the non-profit Beard Season charity

'This year, the creative team, Mike Kennedy and Pauline Ashford, went one step further and came up with a festive gift idea to feature on our cards - Beard Baubles. It was a striking image.'

The craze isn't just a hit with humans either.

'We've heard about hairy dogs wearing Beard Baubles too,' Mr Dearn added.

Beard Baubles have in fact been so successful that they have now sold out across Europe.

Ms Ashford, one of the creatives at Grey London, told MailOnline: 'The interest has been huge, it seems bearded men (and dogs) all over the world have been neglected at Christmas time up until now.

'We physically couldn't make enough Beard Baubles to satisfy the demand and post them all out in time for Christmas. But we'll be ready next year.

'Because there was still massive interest after we sold out of Original Beard Baubles, ​we decided that we would create some Limited Edition packs, to raise even more money for melanoma research, and to stretch the skin cancer awareness campaign longer over the festive period, especially in Australia where it is summer.'

All proceeds from the baubles go to Beard Season, a non-profit Australian-based charity which works to raise awareness of melanoma.

For every bag of baubles sold, the money will go to Beard Season - a charity which encourages men to grow a beard for December. Men are urged to upload photos of their facial hair to Twitter using #BeardBaubles

The outfit has been running its December-themed initiative in Australia for the last two years, but has become more well-known in the UK since it teamed up with Grey London's Beard Baubles. 

Men are encouraged to grow their beard for the entire month, and upload photographs of their progress – and Beard Baubles - to social media under #BeardBaubles.

Beard Season founder Mr Niggles - who is also known as Scott Maggs -  said the support of the initiative had been 'phenomenal'.

He told Philanthropy: 'The real goal of the #BeardBaubles isn't raising funds, it's inspiring action, and every day now, hundreds of people are signing up as Beard Season Ambassadors on our website, following us on social media, booking skin checks, and spreading the word.

'We've generated millions in earned media, and if we can save at least one life through early detection of melanoma, then it's all been worthwhile.'
