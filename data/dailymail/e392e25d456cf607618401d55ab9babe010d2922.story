A schoolgirl died following a severe asthma attack after her doctors had to repeatedly remind her to use her inhaler.

Chloe Passmore had been treated in hospital twice for her condition but an inquest was told her asthma was sometimes not being 'well controlled.'

Last March the schoolgirl - described as a 'beautiful angel' by friends - was in her bedroom when she collapsed with a massive seizure after taking a shower.

Chloe Passmore, 12, died from a severe asthma attack after her doctors had to repeatedly remind her to use her inhaler. Chloe had been treated in hospital twice for her condition

An inquest into the death of Chloe Passmore was told that her asthma was sometimes not being 'well controlled' and she had to be reminded to use her inhaler

She was rushed to hospital where doctors battled in vain for nearly an hour to save her.

An inquest was told Chloe, from Lancaster, had first been diagnosed with asthma in 2006. She had been to the doctors many times with asthma complaints and was hospitalised twice in 2011 after suffering attacks.

She was later given a brown 'preventative' steroid inhaler as well as her usual inhaler which gave immediate relief.

But the day before her death last March, she had been off sick from Our Lady’s Catholic College, Morecambe Road, Lancaster where she was a Year Eight pupil, after feeling breathless during the night.

She was still unwell the following day and had returned to her bedroom after taking a shower.

Tributes: Headmaster Brendan Conboy said the whole community of Our Lady¿s School in Lancaster was extremely shocked and saddened by the tragic death of Miss Passmore

The hearing was told Chloe started having an acute asthma attack and her mother Wendy Passmore went upstairs to find her daughter panicking and struggling to breathe. Her inhaler was giving her no relief so an ambulance was called.

When the ambulance arrived, medical staff began trying to resuscitate Chloe who was in respiratory arrest. En route to Royal Lancaster Infirmary hospital the crew began to revive her with CPR.

But just under an hour after she arrived in the accident and emergency department, and after continuous attempts to revive her, Chloe was pronounced dead.

Dr Stefanie Bitetti, consultant paediatric pathologist, said the post-mortem examination revealed evidence of a rare thyroid disease and a problem in the adrenal glands, but these were 'incidental findings' and did not contribute to Chloe’s death.

'In my opinion, Chloe died as a result of an acute and fatal asthma attack,' said Dr Bitetti.

Dr Graeme Mechie, GP at Owen Road surgery in Lancaster, confirmed Chloe had been to the doctors many times with asthma complaints and had been given a brown ‘preventative’ inhaler as well as her usual inhaler which gave immediate relief.

Dr Mechie said there had been occasions when Chloe needed to be reminded to keep using her brown inhaler, but added: 'It’s sometimes quite tough to persuade children to take an inhaler when they don’t see an immediate benefit.'

Recording a verdict of death by natural causes Lancashire deputy coroner Simon Jones, said there was evidence in the past that Chloe’s asthma was not being 'well controlled.'

But he added: 'It would appear that in the last 24-36 months of Chloe’s life the usage of her medication was in line with what Dr Mechie expected.'

At the time of Chloe’s death tributes were paid to the youngster. Her headmaster Brendan Conboy said: 'The whole community of Our Lady’s is extremely shocked and saddened by the tragic death of this lovely girl.

'She will be fondly remembered and we offer our deepest condolences to her family and many friends. Chloe and her family were remembered in a special Mass for the whole school and we will keep them all in our prayers.'

On a Facebook tribute page Hope Robson said: 'The angels gained another beautiful little girl. We have all missed you so so much. You were taken too soon but we have to accept that God takes the best. Love you Chloe.'
