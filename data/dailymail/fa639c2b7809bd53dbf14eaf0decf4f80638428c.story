The John Terry racism trial will follow his accuser Anton Ferdinand ‘for the rest of his career’, a court heard yesterday.

Duncan Penny, prosecuting, said it had taken courage to make a criminal allegation against a fellow footballer.

He said Terry must be judged guilty if the court was satisfied he said ‘f***ing black c***’ as an insult, regardless of his motivation.

In court: John Terry, pictured today,  is accused of calling Anton Ferdinand a 'f****** black c*** during a Premier League game but he denies a racially aggravated public order offence claiming he was repeating a slur

Denial: Terry denies a racially aggravated public 
order offence, and claims that he was sarcastically repeating the slur 
that Ferdinand mistakenly thought he had used. A verdict is expected tomorrow

The Chelsea defender, and former 
England captain, is accused of lashing out verbally in a Premier League 
match after being goaded about an extra-marital affair with a 
team-mate’s girlfriend.

Terry, 31, admits using the offending
words, but claims he was simply repeating back the slur he thought 
Ferdinand had directed at him, and denies a racially aggravated public 
order offence.

Making his closing speech at 
Westminster magistrates’ court, Mr Penny said Ferdinand, who plays for 
QPR, did not have the ‘motivation or frankly the sophistication’ to make
up the allegation.

He said the brother of Manchester 
United star Rio did not even believe he had been abused until he saw 
footage of October’s incident on YouTube.

‘This case will follow him for the rest of his career. He made it clear he did not wish to be here,’ added Mr Penny.

George Carter-Stephenson, QC, defending, said there was an abundance of evidence to prove ‘this is not a case about racism’.

He said Ferdinand’s evidence was 
inconsistent and unreliable and argued that Terry may have misheard the 
word ‘black’ or been confused by a shout from the crowd.

Support: Former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho denied Terry was a racist in a statement read at court. Yesterday, team mate Ashley Cole, right, said Terry should not have been brought to court over the claims

Mr Carter-Stephenson rejected claims 
that Terry lost his temper to goading about the alleged affair, taunts 
which he had faced 'hundreds of times before'.

The barrister asked: 'Can it really 
be right that Mr Terry totally loses his cool, as suggested by the 
prosecution, in relation to a further taunt by Mr Ferdinand about 
s******* his team mate's missus?

'The defence suggests that there is an inherent implausibility in that, given the evidence before this court.

'Mr Terry has 600 games behind him by 
way of professional top-level football experience, spanning 14 years. He
has been sent off on four occasions, never in relation to his language.

'It is inconceivable to suggest that 
the taunt from Anton Ferdinand, that Mr Terry has heard hundreds of 
times before, and you may think he's heard far worse in relation to his 
mother, made him snap in the way suggested.'

After hearing the speeches, magistrates adjourned the hearing until tomorrow afternoon when they will deliver a verdict.

The court heard yesterday that some fans have chanted sexual insults about Terry's mother.

Expert lip-readers were called in by both the prosecution and defence as part of the trial.

However Mr Carter-Stephenson said lip-reading even in controlled conditions only has an accuracy of 60 to 80 per cent.

Key moment: Terry and QPR's Anton Ferdinand clash during the Barclays Premier League match at Loftus Road

Terry, 31, is accused of using the racial slur on the pitch during a game on October 23 last year.

He denies a racially aggravated 
public order offence, and claims that he was sarcastically repeating the
slur that Ferdinand mistakenly thought he had used.

Earlier, England and Chelsea team mate Ashley Cole said Terry should not have been brought to court over the claims.

Cole, also 31, told Westminster Magistrates' Court: 'I think we shouldn't be sitting here.'

He said while racism should never be tolerated, repeating what you thought someone said was 'completely different'.

Cole said: 'If I repeated something that I thought you said, that's totally different than if someone just says something.'

The court was read a statement from former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, who denied Terry was racist.

Mourinho,
who manages Spanish champions Real Madrid, said Terry had an excellent 
relationship with all the players regardless of ethnicity when he was 
Chelsea boss between June 2004 and September 2009. Terry also championed
the FA's anti-racism campaigns.

Mourinho said: 'I never once 
witnessed any demonstration of racism or racial abuse or behaviour. I am
certain that John Terry is not a racist.'

Several
players - including Frank Lampard, Fernando Torres and Petr Cech - had 
signed copies of a prepared statement that said: 'I have never heard 
John Terry use any form of racist language and have never heard any 
suggestion that he may have done so.'

Earlier, Cole told the court that on the day of the match at Loftus Road, he saw Ferdinand make a fist gesture to imply sex and could see him saying something.

He said: 'I can't make out - him either saying Bridgey (Cole made the fist gesture) or black.'

This has been taken as a taunt about Terry's alleged affair with Wayne Bridges' ex-girlfriend.

Cole did not hear Terry say anything in reply to the goading, he said.

After the match, Cole was present when Terry asked Ferdinand what had happened.

'I think John said, "did you think I called you a black c***, did you think I was being racist?'".Then I said, "did you think John was being racist?". Anton said, "no, no".'

The two players then shook hands and went their separate ways.

It is expected that prosecution and defence counsel will give their closing speeches today, and Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle will give his verdict tomorrow afternoon.

A verdict is expected today.
