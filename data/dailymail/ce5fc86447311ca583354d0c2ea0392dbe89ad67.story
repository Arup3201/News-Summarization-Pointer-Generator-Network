Arizona Senator, Jeff Flake, took a vacation from Capitol Hill, and went on a four day survivalist holiday with his two teenage sons to an isolated, uninhabited tropical island.

A Republican Congressman, Flake and his youngest sons, Taller, 15, and Dallin, 13, traveled 5,200 miles from Phoenix, Arizona to Biggarenn, in the North Pacific Ocean, without any food or water.

Part of the Marshall Islands, the beach front destination offered no amenities, forcing the Flakes to catch and cook their own food, purify their water, and swim with the sharks to procure their meals.

Distance: Flake and his sons traveled thousands of miles from the United States to the isolated island of Biggarenn in the Marshall Islands

Remote: Biggarenn, where Senator Flake and his two young sons vacationed, is in The Marshall Islands, located between Hawaii and Papua New Guinea. It is just 55 to 70 acres wide.

Flake and his two boys lived off the island, eating a unvaried diet of coconuts, crab, and fish, which they captured themselves and cooked over an open fire started with a magnifying glass.

The Flakes swam in the ocean and speared fish for their meals. They also brought along a lobster trap, but soon after arriving, it was mangled by a shark who tried to get at the fish caught inside.

That was only to be the Flake's first fight with sharks over food.

Flake told The Washington Post that one of the most memorable moments of the trip was when he and his 15-year were pursed by sharks, who they had to race back to the shore, after spearing a fish in the ocean.

Fishing: Flake and his sons (one of whom is seen here) brought no food with them to the island, but rather speared their own fish from the ocean and cooked it over an open fire

Success: Dallin, 13, shows off a fish that he speared for lunch in the ocean while on a survivalist vacation in the Marshall Islands with his Senator father

The Senator and his son got away unharmed and laughed as they retold the story to a television reporter at KSAZ Fox 10 News.

The family lived outdoors during their time on island, sleeping in hammocks under the stars. 'It’s not just a regular Boy Scout camp, it’s more survival,' Flake told The Post.

The Flakes didn't even bring any drinking water to the island, but instead had two desalinators, which they had to pump for an hour each night to turn the ocean water into drinkable water.

Roughing it hundreds of miles from civilization, the Senator and his sons had very little contact with the rest of the world over the four days.

Cooking: Tanner, 15, eats from a roasted coconut shell that he found and prepared on the desert island

The Island of Biggarenn is located between Hawaii and Papua New Guinea. The Senator and his boys traveled from their hometown of Phoenix to Hawaii, and from there to the Marshall Islands.

They then took a three hour boat ride aboard a small fishing boat to Biggarenn, which Flake told the paper was just 55 to 70 acres wide. The entire trip with travel time lasted a week.

However, the Senator did stay connected to his constituents and his wife with a satellite phone, which he brought along at her insistence, he told the paper.

Sleeping: Flake and his sons roughed it on their survivalist vacation, sleeping out under the stars on hammocks

Diet: While on the island, the Flakes captured, killed, and cooked their own food, which consisted of a diet of crabs, fish, and coconuts

Dinner: Senator Jeff Flake shows off a big fish that he speared off the waters of Biggarenn island

For entertainment, the boys brought along an exercise ball, which they half buried under the sand and did back flips from.

The extraordinary nature of the trip aside, Flake told interviewers that his favorite part of the vacation was just to spend some alone time with his sons.

'I tell ya, for a dad it was a wonderful thing. No video games around, no television, no distractions, no texting. Just talking,' he told The Post.

Fun: Flake's teenage sons brought an exercise ball to the desert island, which they half buried in the sand and did flips off of to entertain themselves. In this picture 15-year-old Tanner is captured mid-flip

Snorkeling: Tanner and Dallin swim off the coast of the Marshall Islands where the explored the sea life and fished for their meals using spears

The recent family outing marked the Senator's second visit to the Marshall Islands, the first being in 2009 when he went on a similar survivalist vacation for seven days by himself.

When asked why travel to a deserted island and not a more popular vacation spot, Flake told Buzzfeed simply, 'Everybody goes to Disneyland.'

However, in travel diaries published from his first trip in The Washington Post Flake revealed that the trip had been a long time dream. 'I have the best job in the world, but still the islands beckon,' he wrote.

Sharks: The Flakes swam with sharks in the waters surrounding the island. They were even chased by one in pursuit of a fish the family had speared for dinner

Flake published the journals to give the public full disclosure about his time away from service after a scandal emerged in June 2009 exposing then-South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford's secret trip abroad to see his girlfriend.

'My wife said, you know that nobody’s going to believe you were out on the island alone, right?,' Flake told the paper in his recent interview.

'And that’s when I decided to go through the Post and just gave her my journal entries and the pictures I’d taken, and I thought that was better, so people knew more that they wouldn’t assume.'

Flake promised to take his sons back with him to the island after his two-year Senatorial campaign concluded.

Both trips were arranged with the help of the ambassador to the U.S. from the Marshall Islands who Flake told the paper is 'a friend.'

Flake will release the journals recording his most recent trip soon.

Though the island was hundreds of miles away from Washington Flake told the Post he did have one political revelation while on vacation, 'That this ought to be mandatory. We’d all discover that no man is an island.'
