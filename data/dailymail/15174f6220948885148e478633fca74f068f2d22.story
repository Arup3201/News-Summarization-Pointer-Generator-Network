Sunseekers could pay for an extra two days of their holiday simply by haggling when they buy goods abroad.

Tourists who are happy to barter can save up to £118.80 on meals, souvenirs, and day-trips during a week-long getaway, according to new research, which is enough to pay for a full two more days.

The best holiday hagglers are located in Northern Ireland, the North-West and Wales, with Belfast, Cardiff and Liverpool crowned the Bartering Brit capitals of the UK. 

Smart shopper: Britons are advised that they can save £118 by haggling on their holidays

The most resistant are holidaymakers in the South East. Southampton and Brighton shoppers are least likely to haggle.

Holiday hagglers admit to bartering most often when they feel overcharged by inflated tourist prices, according to a new study.

And one in three Brit travelers reckon they can save up to 28 per cent off the asking price. 

1. Spain

2. Turkey

3. Greece 

4. Egypt

5. Portugal

1. Jewellery

2. Souvenirs

3. Clothes

4. Handbags

5. Ornaments 

Spain is listed as the top country for bartering, with Britons more likely to get a discount on their goods.

The Iberian peninsula surprisingly beat Turkey for its acceptance of haggling, which took second place, followed by Greece.

Northern Irish travellers are the best hagglers, but those from Brighton don't fare so well

Egypt and Portugal also made it into the top five destinations for negotiating a bargain. 

Psychologist Dr Sandi Mann of the University of Central Lancashire explains: 'Many 'wannabe hagglers' are still put off by the traditionally British attitude that talking about money is rude.' 

'Negotiating money off in any situation begins with a state of mine - and if you've had success on holiday, it gives you the confidence to bring those skills back with you.' 

'Negotiating is a game and if you learn the rules abroad, it will become second nature in everyday life.'

The Negotiation Academy was launched by webuyanycar.com at the start of 2014 with the aim of empowering the British public to buy better and save more. 

Dr Mann also listed her top tips for a successful haggling experience abroad.

1. First impressions: Never show that you love an item, always create the impression you quite like it, but you would need to be persuaded to part with cash. Always wait to be approached before starting your negotiation. In fact, it's a good idea to look as if you are about to walk away when they approach you.

2. Embrace 'tourist traps': On a packed street of restaurants or souvenir shops, you hold all the aces. Choose a quieter time when they are more desperate for customers, be bold and negotiate up front on what you are prepared to pay.

3. Brush up your acting skills: This is a game, so be prepared to play. Wait for an opening price, look shocked and start walking away. The stallholder might ask how much you are willing to pay - always answer with half the amount they first priced it at.

4. Choose your friends: Always smile and be pleasant, make friends - but don't get too friendly or you will start to feel sorry for the stallholder when he tells you his sob story about how little money he is making.

5. Mix up your tactics: If you're with a partner or friend, play good cop, bad cop where one enthuses over the item while the other points out its flaws. If you're with a small child, explain they are spending their pocket money and only have a small amount (if this is true - don't encourage deceitful behaviour in your kids!)

6. Language barrier: Turn any language barrier to your advantage by pretending you don't understand when they tell you exactly why the item is worth so much more than you want to pay. Just repeat your offer and look blankly at any attempts they might make at justifying their price.
