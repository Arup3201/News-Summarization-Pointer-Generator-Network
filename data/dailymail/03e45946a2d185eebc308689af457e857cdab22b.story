Jozy Altidore has threatened to quit Sunderland unless he is given more first-team opportunities – but the USA striker has scored just once in 35 Premier League appearances.

The 24-year-old – a £6.5million signing from AZ Alkmaar in 2013 – netted his only league goal last December and has drawn a blank in 23 top-flight matches since.

But Altidore – who scored 23 times in his final season in Holland – has warned the Black Cats that he will leave in January if he doesn't win a regular starting spot.

Altidore is unhappy about a lack of first-team opportunities at the Stadium of Light this season

'I thought I'd done everything I could this season to come in as fit as possible with the injury (hamstring strain suffered at the World Cup) and try to make an impact when I've played,' he said, having found the back of the net in the League Cup defeat to Stoke last month.

'But this four years I want to be part of the national team. Jurgen (Klinsmann, USA manager) makes his message very clear, nobody is different, so if it doesn't turn around, then in January I'll be looking to start elsewhere and make sure that I'm in his plans.'

Sunderland boss Gus Poyet praised Altidore following his strike in the cup but he has not been seen since, failing to emerge from the bench during the goalless draw with Swansea and 3-1 win over Stoke.

His struggle echoes that of his season on loan at Hull five years ago. Then only 19 but with a big reputation after joining Villarreal for £6m from New York Red Bulls, he scored one goal in 28 outings and was sent off – against Sunderland – in the defeat which confirmed Hull's relegation from the top flight.

Altidore is currently away on international duty and is unlikely to feature when Poyet's 13th-placed side return to action at Southampton next Saturday.
