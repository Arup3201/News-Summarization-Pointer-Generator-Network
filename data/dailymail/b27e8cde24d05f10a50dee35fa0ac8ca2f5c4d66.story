Breaking the glass ceiling: Women are being urged to take advantage of childcare for the sake of their jobs (file photo)

Women's careers are being held back by the feeling they have to spend as much time as possible looking after their families,  a professor has claimed.

Professor Uta Frith says women with successful careers should be prepared to spend heavily on childcare to allow them to scale the corporate ladder.

She criticised the idea that women have to be able to do everything and said: 'I have one piece of advice... throw money at it.'

She told the Independent: 'Spend every penny you've got on getting proper childcare, because I'm really convinced that this is something that holds these high-flying women back.'

The neuroscience and psychology expert is no stranger to success herself, being a a Fellow of the Royal Society, British Academy and the Academy of Medical Sciences.

Her comments come in the wake of reports that the glass ceiling is still very much in place as it emerged that just two of the top 100 FTSE-listed firms have female directors.

Women do not need to go down the path of juggling work and home commitments and can find alternative methods of both rearing a family and excelling in their chosen field, said Professor Frith.

Don't hold back: Working mothers should not feel guilty about devoting time to their careers, said Professor Frith (file photo)

'They think they have to be these 
stay-at-home mothers to some extent. There is a funny burden there... 
you carry it with you,' she added.

Upon being made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2005, the autism expert set about encouraging other women to follow suit as females made up just six per cent of the fellowship.

She also founded UCL Women, a network which holds monthly meetings to allow professional women to network and share their experiences.
