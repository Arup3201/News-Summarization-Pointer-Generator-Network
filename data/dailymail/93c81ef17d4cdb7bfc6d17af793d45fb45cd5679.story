Clocking up the cash: The iconic Big Ben clock could be hired out to film-makers as a film set

Film directors could be invited to shoot inside the Big Ben clock tower to turn Parliament into a moneyspinner.

MPs want to charge production companies to gain access to the landmark as part of plans to raise an extra £3million a year by making the Palace of Westminster ‘operate more commercially as a visitor attraction’.

The idea comes after proposals to charge visitors to climb the tower, renamed the Elizabeth Tower in honour of the Queen after the Diamond Jubilee, were dropped.

It raises the possibility of the Big Ben bell and the spiral staircase leading up to it being used as the centrepiece of an action movie.

The clock has played a central role in many films – most notably the 1978 version of the Thirty Nine Steps, in which the hero is seen hanging from its hands – but cameras are not usually allowed inside the tower itself.

Other suggestions, unveiled in a report by the House of Commons finance and services committee, include hiring out some of the Commons’ most opulent dining rooms.

There are plans to charge visitors for ‘premium tours’ of Westminster Hall, the most ancient part of Parliament.

But the idea of using the home of British democracy as a cash cow could prove controversial.

Tory MP Robert Halfon, who led the campaign against charging for entry to the tower, said: ‘Parliament should be for the people, and not become a theme park.

‘This is the greatest Parliament in the world, in one of the oldest democracies in the world.

'It should not be a plaything for film moguls and big business trying to make a quick buck.’

It comes as the Speaker considers a separate report on possible plans for vacating the Houses of Parliament while essential repairs are carried out.

Under the plans, MPs could be forced to meet in the nearby Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre after the election, while Lords could have to sit in Church House.

In the meantime, however, MPs are looking at ways to make more money out of the international fame of the Houses of Parliament.

They have a target of an extra £3million in revenue a year by 2015.

The committee’s report said: ‘For many years the House has carried out revenue raising activities notably through catering, retail and visitor services.

'These have been expanding in recent years, for example through Saturday opening for visitors.

‘The House of Commons Commission agreed that there should be a clearer separation between Parliament as a working body and Parliament as a visitor attraction and agreed that the financial plans should be based on developing a number of activities for the House to operate more commercially as a visitor attraction.’

However, the report does suggest charging for tours of Westminster Hall, where King Charles I was convicted of treason and members of the Royal Family lie in state.

They are considering a ‘tiered visitor admission offer including a short tour of Westminster Hall, an audio-guided tour and a premium tour with a guide’.

Another idea is to allow businesses and wealthy individuals to hire out some of Parliament’s most exclusive rooms for parties and other events ‘on an experimental basis for two years on a limited number of occasions when they are not expected to be used by members’.

Among them is the Atrium, the large hall in Portcullis House, where many MPs have their office.

The Atrium hit the headlines earlier this year when it emerged that 12 fig trees there cost taxpayers thousands of pounds a year.

MPs could also open up the many dining rooms in the Palace with exclusive views across the Thames; while another option is the Terrace Pavilion, a marquee standing on the terrace by the river.

Labour MP John Mann said: ‘If these plans can make a profit for the taxpayer, I’m all in favour.

'Let’s follow the example of the Queen with Buckingham Palace and make money out of this place.

‘Why not go further, and set up the House of Lords chamber as a restaurant and tea room for tourists.’

Last night the Speaker received a report on possible plans for vacating the Houses of Parliament while repairs are carried out.

The most likely option are the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre near Westminster Abbey for MPs and Church House for peers.

Other more drastic options are being considered, including creating an entirely new parliament building in Covent Garden.

The idea has been proposed amid the soaring bill for repairing the Grade I listed Palace of Westminster, which is suffering from chronic subsidence, electrical problems, and various other safety hazards.

The work, which will have to start shortly after the next General Election, is expected to cost taxpayers more than £3 billion.
