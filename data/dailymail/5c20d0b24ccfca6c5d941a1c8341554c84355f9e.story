Kerry Washington's new InStyle cover is being attacked on social media by critics who have accused the fashion magazine of editing the image in order to purposefully 'whitewash' the star and drastically alter her appearance.

The 38-year-old actress happily took to Instagram on Wednesday to reveal her latest cover, writing: 'I'm THRILLED to share with you all that I'm on the cover of this year's March @instylemagazine! Can't wait for you guys to see it and read it! So honored. And crazy excited.'

But many of her fans were unable to feign pleasure over the image – and quickly responded to share their outrage at the overly-edited image.

Appearances are deceiving: Online critics are slamming Kerry Washington's cover of InStyle and accusing the magazine of 'whitewashing' the star for its March 2015 issue

Valentine's Day is around the corner and love is in the air. In this case, Kerry Washington doesn't wear her heart on her sleeve, but on her purse. The Scandal star hosted an event in California in a polka dot Dolce & Gabbana dress and Rover Vivier shoulder bag. Flawless!

The design duo Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana had fun with spots in their Spring collection playing with size and proportion. In one look, the black dots were combined with a floral print, in another they decorated a sheer overlay, and yet again they were used and paired with fringe.

The Italian designers weren't the only ones who were whipped into a speckled frenzy. Spots appeared on the Spring runway at Marc by Marc Jacobs and See by Chloe as well.

Many voiced their thoughts by posting in the comments section under Kerry’s image, lashing out at what they described as a ‘false representation’ of the Scandal star.

One woman went as far as to suggest that the magazine should issue an apology to Kerry for altering the image so drastically, referring to the cover as 'an egregious mistake'.

'You mean to tell me your editors saw fit to Photoshop @kerrywashington to the point where not only is her completion is severely lightened but the ENTIRE character of her face is altered?' she fumed. 'Your magazine needs to issue a statement of apology not only to your readers but to Kerry Washington as well.'

Another woman chimed in to say that she would boycotting the magazine from here on out, adding that she was ‘disgusted’ at the behavior of the magazine’s editors.

'Sooooo what you guys do it brighten the photo to a point that Kerry looks WHITE!?? Never buying your magazine again. I'm DISGUSTED! #BLACKISBEAUTIFUL!' she wrote.

Someone else added: 'They removed everything that makes her Kerry. Why the lighter skin, why the thinner lips? Lord forgive them.'  

False representation: One woman called out the magazine on Instagram, calling the InStyle cover 'an egregious mistake'

Angry customer: Another critic said she would never buy InStyle again because the magazine made Kerry 'look white'

An unhappy man: This Twitter user also accused the magazine of 'whitewashing' the actress 

Critics also took to Twitter to share their disgust.

'Some woman pretending to be Kerry Washington is on the cover of InStyle magazine. #Scandal,' someone wrote.

Another man added: 'What did InStyle Magazine do to my Kerry Washington?! The picture doesn't even look like her #whitewashing #Instylemagazinecovers .'

This isn't the first time fans have been left outraged by one of Kerry's cover photos, nor is InStyle the first magazine called out for supposedly lightening someone's skin.

Many people felt that Kerry’s December 2013/January 2014 cover of Lucky had been edited beyond all recognition, with many voicing similar concerns about the apparent lightening of her skin color.

Meanwhile, Lupita Nyong'o's 2014 spread in Vanity Fair saw similar criticisms.

And in 2010, Elle was accused of lightening Gabourey Sidibe's skin for its 25th anniversary issue, but the magazine maintained that the cover appearance was the result of studio lighting.

Beyond the cover, Kerry spoke with the magazine about her red carpet style and her Olivia Pope-inspired clothing line for The Limited.

The Scandal star noted her personal style is more daring than her fashionable television character's.  

'Red-Carpet Kerry wears a lot more color and pattern than Olivia does,' she explained. 'She makes bold choices.

She continued: 'When I was pregnant, I showed up at the SAG awards in a bare-midriff gown by Prada. I knew some people were going to hate it, but I thought it was super cute and really fun.'

While she had no problem flaunting her baby bump, the new mom said she relied on pilates, Tracy Anderson pregnancy DVDs, hiking, the elliptical machine and yoga get her figure back after giving birth to her daughter Isabelle in May.

She also talked about her experience as a working mom with a young child. 

'Women use this "guilt" word a lot, but I’m not sure how I feel about it,' she explained. 'I know why it’s the word that keeps coming up, but I can’t co-sign on it yet... You can’t be all things to all people all the time. 

'You have to experience your humanity, you have to know you are a limited vessel, and you can only do so much.'
