A boy of 10 has written a heart-breaking letter to Santa asking him to cure his father of a deadly brain tumour.

Ronnie Harris has told Father Christmas he has just one wish this year - help for Russell Harris, 32, as he fights for his life. The big-hearted youngster from Ipswich does not ask for a single present for himself.

Ronnie said he would be the 'happiest boy in the whole world' if Father Christmas could make his poignant dream come true.

Letter: Ronnie does not ask Santa for a single gift for himself this coming Christmas

His mother, Emma Harris, 31, found the poignant letter under her son's bed - and was moved to tears with pride.

Mrs Harris, of Ipswich, Suffolk, said: 'I didn't even know he had it.

'I was just cleaning Ronnie's bedroom when I found it shoved under his bed. I was very touched.

'It was heart-wrenching to think that a child of his age doesn't want anything for himself for Christmas.'

Mrs Harris, who looks after her stricken husband around the clock at home, added: 'It made me cry.'I felt so proud of him for thinking just of his dad and wanting him better.'

She has known Mr Harris since they were three-year-olds growing up in the same neighbourhood in Ipswich.

The childhood sweethearts started going out when they were teenagers, got married in August 2010 and also have a son Lennie, six.

Dear Santa,

This Christmas I would like one specific thing this year.

My dad has a really bad brain tuma (sic).

Could you please find a cure for him to make him better and I will be the happiest boy in the whole world!

Merry Christmas,

Yours sincerely,

Ronnie Harris

But they were left reeling when Mr Harris was struck down by a devastating brain tumour eight years ago.

The malignant, inoperable growth has become more aggressive and is now classed as grade four severity, leaving him critically ill and taking every day as it comes.

'The boys have good days and bad days. I care for Russell 24 hours a day and make sure my kids do everything they need to.

'Every day is absolutely normal. I still take them to school - I do everything a mother would do,' said Emma.

'But it's hard to see when he's badly sick a lot.

'Ronnie does stuff 10-year-olds shouldn't have to do, like making his brother's breakfast and learning to cook.'

She said Ronnie was distraught when his school recently finished runners-up in a table tennis competition because he so badly wanted to win for his father.

But Mrs Harris said that despite her husband's illness, he has continued to attend all of his son's home matches for local football club Ipswich Valley Rangers FC.

Brave: Ronnie helps his mother by looking after his little brother

'Ronnie has dealt so maturely with his dad's illness,' she said.

'He's called an ambulance when Russell has been very unwell and learned new skills to help around the house.

'Ronnie's even taking the cooking class in school so that he can cook his dad's dinner.'
