The defense expert who inspired Kelly McGillis's character 'Charlie Blackwood' in the iconic eighties film Top Gun, has become the highest-ever ranking woman at the Pentagon.

President Barack Obama promoted Christine Fox to the post of acting deputy defense secretary on Tuesday.

Previously, she was chosen to give insight to McGillis during the filming of Top Gun because, like the character in the film, Fox was never a pilot, but was an expert in air and maritime defense.

She will replace the current deputy Ashton Carter who is stepping down. In doing so, Fox will make American military history with no female having ever reached that rank in the U.S. defense department.

Despite glittering career as a public servant, Fox may be better known as the inspiration for 'Charlie' Blackwood, a flight instructor and love interest to Tom Cruise's 'Maverick.'

During the production, Fox spent time with both cast and crew of the Tony Scott film to advise them on factual accuracy.

She famously told People magazine in 1985, 'I don't know anything about flying airplanes, but I know a lot about the guy in the back seat â€” his mission, his radar and his missiles'.

Fox has previously held the post of director of cost controls at the Pentagon, which she left last summer.

An American defense spokesperson confirmed that Fox will step into the role until the permanent successor for Carter is appointed.

In a statement, defense secretary Chuck Hagel called Fox 'a brilliant defense thinker and proven manager (who) knows the intricacies of the Department's budget, programs and global operations better than anyone.'

A senior defense official told NBC News that Fox would be able to 'hit the ground running like no one else can.'
