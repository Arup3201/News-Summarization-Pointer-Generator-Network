A high school senior in Duluth, Georgia will not graduate this year after being put on suspension for hugging a teacher.

Gwinnett Public School District officials say the move was sexual harassment, but 17-year-old Duluth High School student Sam McNair says he was just trying to comfort the female teacher and that he comes from a family of 'huggers'.

'Something so innocent can be perceived as something totally opposite,' McNair told CBS Atlanta. 

His mother also says the suspension cold also cost him an athletic college scholarship.

Sexual harasser? 17-year-old Sam McNair was suspended for an entire year after violating his school's sexual harassment policy by hugging a teacher. He is a senior and won't graduate on time unless the suspension is overturned

The teacher says she warned McNair that hugging was inappropriate and that the hug was more than just a hug - that McNair also kissed her.

The unwelcome embrace was caught on one of the school's cameras and shows McNair hugging the teacher from behind, and resting his head on her shoulder.

Too close for comfort: In the disciplinary report, the teacher wrote that she could feel McNair's cheeks and lips touch her neck

Don't stand so close to me: The teacher is clearly not happy with the embrace, as she pushes McNair away

In the discipline report, the teacher says McNair's cheeks and lips touched her neck.

McNair denies kissing the teacher, and says he didn't know it was against the school's  rules on sexual harassment to hug a teacher. He says he's hugged other teachers before - including the teacher in question.

Mother April McNair says she should have at least been notified of the problem before a disciplinary action was taken that jeopardized her son's future.

Should have been warned: Sam's mother April McNair is not happy she wasn't informed about the hugging problem before her son was given such a long suspension

'He's a senior he plays football and was getting ready for lacrosse and you're stripping him of even getting a full scholarship for athletics for college,' she said.

According to officials, Ms McNair can appeal the suspension to the school board.

They would not respond to questions about the case directly, but issued a statement saying 'hearing officers consider witness testimony, a review of the known facts, and a student's past disciplinary hearing...when determining consequences.'

While McNair does have a disciplinary record, none of his prior actions involved sexual assault.
