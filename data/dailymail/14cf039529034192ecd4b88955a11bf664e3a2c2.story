For author Nancy Freund, raw chicken is coloured blue. Pain, of whatever variety, is orange, while different letters show up in different hues.

Freund is one of the estimated four per cent of the population with synaesthesia, a neurological condition that makes sufferers see the world in vivid hues.

Here, Freund, author of a semi-autobiographical new novel named Rapeseed that charts the adventures of a woman with the condition, reveals what living in a real-life rainbow is really like.

Vivid: Author and synaesthete Nancy Freund sees pain as orange, chicken as blue and the letter A as yellow

'Speaking about the condition, synaesthete Humberto C. Antunes once said: 'Synaesthesia is not a condition – it’s a super-power!  Like flying or throwing fire from the finger.'

But I didn't know that growing up. I had never heard about synaesthesia, a condition that affects approximately four per cent of the population and turns letters and numbers into vivid colours.

My ability to taste colour and even hear it made me different. But, as I was to discover, seeing the world through a kaleidoscope would prove to be a stroke of luck that would reverberate throughout my life.

I was also nine when I started my first book – a thriller called The Orange Invasion in which lurid orange jelly beans attack a city simply by being orange. 

'My parents loved the fact that their young daughter was writing a book, but they worried that the premise made no sense.  But it made sense to me.

Incredible: Many blind people, among them Stevie Wonder, perceive the world around them in bright colour

Colourful world: Both Pharrell Williams and Lady Gaga are reported to be among the synaesthete population

How could they not know that particular colour orange is violent? Seeing it inflicts pain – I tried to tell them: stomach aches, head-aches, dizziness, even vomit.

Forty years later I have begun to understand synaesthesia – a neurological field of study that’s in its intriguing infancy. 

There are synaesthesia and neurology labs doing amazing research – Dr. David Eagleman’s program in Houston, Texas is one.

There’s a sensory integration lab at the University of Edinburgh.  There are advancements being made at the University of London and the University of Sussex.

It seems we may be on the cusp of solving important cognition issues of age-related dementia, Alzheimers, dyslexia, and improving knowledge retention for students. 

In my case, I’ve learned enough to know that orange does not inflict pain on most people – not even on most synaesthetes. 

Agonising: For author Nancy Freund, the colour orange is inextricably associated with feeling pain

Quirk: Although pink to most of us, raw chicken is blue according to Freund

Not everyone will agree with me that undercooked chicken is blue.  It doesn’t look blue - just the fact of it is blue. 

It’s a perception, not an actual visible colour, even in the mind.  I think it’s the texture and smell of raw chicken that’s blue – the sliminess, the soft gelatinousness of it.  The danger it represents, eating raw chicken, somehow in my mind’s eye, is just blue.  

Many blind people – including Stevie Wonder – are known to be synaesthetes, which makes sense when you exchange the word  ‘see’ for ‘perceive’.

Evidently, his musical notes are perceived in colour – same as Lady Gaga and Pharrell Williams and Leonard Bernstein. 

So too, Tori Amos and  Duke Ellington.  Many creative geniuses in both visual and performing arts report synaesthetic experience – Vasily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Vincent Van Gogh, Vladimir Nabokov, Marilyn Monroe.  

But all synaesthetes are different.  The letter ‘a’ for one person is yellow and for another it’s blue, while some don't associate a colour associated with ’a' - even if the rest of their alphabet is in colour.

Most people do not associate the colour of cream with the transitional moment of wakefulness to sleep, like I do. 

But as I finally made sense of synaesthesia, I was able to write my own synaesthesia novel that needed to be written.  

In ‘Rapeseed’ Carolann loses her virginity at age 17 in the back of a car in a powerful explosion of colours and smells and cross-wired senses. 

Gift: According to Nancy, seeing the world through a rainbow of bright colour is creative gift

She’s with her twin sister’s boyfriend, so add to all the sensory chaos, a big dose of guilt. Soon after, Carolann marries a man whose career later moves the family from Kansas to London, and she has to figure out who she really is – what her true colours are, you might say – to try to save herself, her marriage, and her family. 

Rapeseed is sort of a grown woman’s coming-of-age story, as she comes into an acceptance of herself, her colours, and smells and cross-wired experience.

In Carolann’s case, synaesthesia is both a blessing and a burden. For most people I’ve interviewed it’s generally viewed as a gift.

But even those who hear loud music or experience powerful phantom smells or must navigate through fogs of false vision -- even then, no one seems willing to lose it.'
