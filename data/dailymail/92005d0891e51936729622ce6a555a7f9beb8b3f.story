Apparent atrocities: Unconfirmed footage shows bodies being thrown off a building in Aleppo as the Syrian conflict becomes increasingly violent

Horrifying footage of rebels hurling bodies off a building in Aleppo has raised concerns that the conflict in Syria is becoming increasingly violent.

Three unconfirmed videos posted online today show apparent atrocities in Aleppo and include footage of postal workers’ bodies being thrown from a roof and a bound man being repeatedly shot.

The amateur footage emerged as rebels Free Syrian Army (FSA) claimed to have shot down a government fighter plane near the Iraqi border.

The video was posted on a 
social media website and showed four armed rebels and a man described in
 the video as a captured pilot in an unidentified location.

State media announced that a jet, which crashed in the same area, had experienced ‘technical problems’.  

Syrian Observatory for Human Rights director Rami Abdel Rahman said that if the videos were verified, he strongly condemned such atrocities regardless of who was responsible.

Mr Rahman told AFP: ‘If these videos are confirmed, such atrocities harm the revolution.

'They only benefit the regime and the enemies of the revolution.’

The new allegations are the latest in the 17-month conflict where both sides have been accused of human rights violations.

In one of the videos, the man filming said: ‘These are the heroes of Bab city who are inside the post office.’

As the crowd gathers, people shout ‘this is a shabiha’, which refers to the pro-government militia, as a man’s body is thrown from the roof.

The bodies are said to be postal workers but it is unclear when the incident occurred.

As fighting in Aleppo continues, rebels say they will turn Syria’s largest city into the 'grave' of the Assad government. Thousands have now fled, with those left running short of food and fuel and afraid for their lives.

Bodies thrown: Crowds gather as bodies are thrown, crashing down on stairs in Aleppo. The footage has not been confirmed and it is unclear when the incident occurred

Shouting crowd: In the footage, people shout 'this is a shabiha', which refers to the pro-government militia, can be heard as the bodies fall

Another amateur video shows a blindfolded man, whose throat is cut repeatedly by an assailant with a small knife. His blood spreads across the pavement as a group of men chant ‘Allahu Akbar’ which means 'God is great'.

In eastern Syria, FSA footage showed a military aircraft bursting into flames after anti-aircraft is heard. Rebel gunners celebrate as the jet crashed near the town of al-Muhassan, 75 miles from the Iraqi border according to the rebels.

Shot down: In the footage anti-aircraft can be heard just before the jet bursts into flames. Rebels are then heard celebrating

State media said the plane was on a ‘routine training mission’ when it experienced ‘technical problems’. The pilot had ejected and the government were searching for him, state media said.

The FSA claim to have shot down the government jet and experts say the camouflage and markings are consistent with that of a Syrian air force plane.

The footage came after reports that rebel gunners have gained access to anti-aircraft weapons.
