Darron Gibson is hoping for a chance to play himself into contention for a showdown with World champions Germany as he continues his comeback from an injury nightmare.

The 26-year-old made his first appearance for club or country in more than 10 months in Ireland's 2-0 friendly victory over Oman last month following a gruelling fightback from a cruciate ligament problem.

He played the full 90 minutes of club Everton's 1-1 Europa League draw with Krasnodar in Russia last Thursday and with James McCarthy missing from Martin O'Neill's squad through injury, will hope to get the nod for Saturday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Gibraltar in Dublin and the intensely difficult trip to Germany which follows three days later.

Darron Gibson hopes his injury nightmare is behind him as he pushes for a place in the Republic of Ireland team for their Euro 2016 qualifiers with Gibraltar and Germany over the coming days

Gibson suffered a cruciate ligament injury in Ireland's World Cup qualifier with Kazakhstan back in October 2013 and was on the sidelines for 10 months

Gibson said: 'I played in the European game during the week and I felt physically strong, so I think I am ready. Hopefully I do get the chance and I do have an influence so I can play on Tuesday.

'I think any player enjoys playing in games like that. They are some of the best players in the world, so it's good to see how you fare against them.

'Obviously, the first few games I played, it was just about getting minutes under my belt. But I think I am ready to play properly now, I think I am match-fit and ready to go.

'It's been all right. It's been a bit frustrating not playing in the Premier League, but I have got two games in in the last two and a half weeks, so I'm happy enough coming into this week.'

Ireland will face Group D minnows Gibraltar - who lost their opening game against Poland 7-0 at home - at the Aviva Stadium knowing goal difference could be important, but taking nothing for granted.

Martin O'Neill will be hoping to gain at least four points from the weekend's double-header 

Gibson said: 'No football game is easy. Obviously we will take the game seriously and hope to get the win.

'I don't think we will be going out there thinking, 'Right, we are going to beat them five or six nil'. It's not as easy as that. We will go out and try our best and hopefully, we get the win.

'We are going into both games and treating them exactly the same. We will focus on Saturday's game first, hopefully get the result we need and then we will push on to Germany on Tuesday.'

Ireland began their preparations in Malahide on Tuesday morning with much of the focus surrounding the camp on manager Martin O'Neill's assistant Roy Keane and his updated autobiography, The Second Half, although the older man was adamant it would not be allowed to prove a distraction.

The build-up to the qualifiers have been dominated by the fall-out from assistant manager Roy Keane's book

O'Neill said: 'The most important issue here is our games, and Saturday [the match against Gibraltar] is really, really important. We have come off the back of a great win against Georgia and it's important to focus on that.

'I genuinely don't know what the headlines are in the book. It obviously was going to cause some sort of furore at some stage or another - the very fact he put his name to this book would suggest that it's exactly what would happen.

'It's there and it doesn't matter. The games are the most important things for us.'
