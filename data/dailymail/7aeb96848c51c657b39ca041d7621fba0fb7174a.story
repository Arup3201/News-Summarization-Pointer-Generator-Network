These stunning images reveal the Milky Way shining a light on the beauty of the UK's South West coast, with Durdle Door appearing to offer a gateway to the galaxy, 

The images were captured by Liverpool-born photographer Stephen Banks, who has spent the last two years learning how to capture the night sky.

The shots were all taken in rural Dorset, one of the last remaining areas of the UK to have avoided excessive light pollution from roads and cities.

These sensational celestial snaps show the Milky Way in all its glory over a series of stunning countryside landscapes. They were taken by amateur photographer Stephen Banks, 25, who has spent the last two years learning how to capture the night sky. This stunning picture of West Bay captures the headlights from a truck parked at the cliff top which look more like beams from an alien spacecraft

Mr Bank’s most recent photos, taken over the past month, include some of the county's most iconic locations such as the renowned beauty spots Durdle Door and Lulworth Cove.

One stunning picture of Durdle Door captures the headlights from a truck parked at the cliff top which look more like beams from an alien spacecraft.

In another, lights from houses in the neighbouring villages of Chideock and Seatown appear to look like fire while high above the Milky Way looks like smoke.

'I pride myself on taking different photos so I like to take pictures of the Milky Way above recognisable landmarks,' said Mr Banks. 'That's why so many of my pictures involve Durdle Door (pictured), because so many people have been there'

Boats in the distance casts a glow on the horizon, revealing the beauty of the Milky Way. Our galaxy is thought to be 120,000 light years across and contains more than 200 billion stars. On a clear night, when you look up into the night sky the most you can see from any one point on the Earth is about 2,500 stars

The Milky Way is thought to be 120,000 light years across and contains more than 200 billion stars.

This makes it a ‘middleweight’ galaxy with the largest galaxy known, IC 1101, containing more than 100 trillion stars.

On a clear night, when you look up into the night sky the most you can see from any one point on the Earth is about 2,500 stars.

Like more than two-thirds of the known galaxies, the Milky Way has a spiral shape. At the centre of the spiral, a lot of energy and, occasionally, vivid flares are created.

Based on the immense gravity that would be required explain the movement of stars and the energy expelled, astronomers believe the centre of the Milky Way has a supermassive black hole.

Astronomers believe the Milky Way wasn’t always a stunning barred spiral. It formed into its current size and shape by ‘eating’ other galaxies.

In order to capture the stunning scenes self-taught Mr Banks programmes the shutter on his digital SLR camera to stay open for 30 seconds at a time to allow as much light in as possible.

The technique allows the camera to see the Milky Way and surrounding stars that would otherwise be invisible to the naked eye.

Mr Banks, 25, whose day job is as a digital executive for Bridport-based Watershed PR, said: ‘I started taking long exposures of the night sky about two years ago.

‘In order to get these photos you need the most clear night possible. Observing the Milky Way is best done at the height of summer when the outer spirals are most visible.

‘The best places to take photos from are those with the least amount of light pollution. There are no cities or motorways in Dorset so there are plenty of places where it is very dark.

‘I check out each location in daylight to make sure I know where I'm going then return at night with a torch, my camera and a tripod.

‘It is hard to see anything with the naked eye so often it is a case of trial and error to establish the best shot.’

Mr Banks explained the camera shutter stays open for 30 seconds to let as much light in as possible. Within five or 10 shots he claim to usually have a good shot.

‘I pride myself on taking different photos so I like to take pictures of the Milky Way above recognisable landmarks,’ he said.

‘That's why so many of my pictures involve Durdle Door, because so many people have been there.

‘I love to show people familiar landscapes that people will not have seen with stars in before.’

While there are dark skies reserves in other parts of the South West, Mr Banks says he would like to see similar schemed in Dorset to help others make the most of the stunning views on offer.
