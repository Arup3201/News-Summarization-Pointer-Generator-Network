Tal Ben Haim will be missing for Charlton when they welcome Birmingham City on Saturday after being allowed leave to observe a religious holiday.

The central defender will be observing Yom Kippur, known as the Day of Atonement in the Jewish calendar.

And the Israel international was given the green light to miss the Championship clash against the Blues by manager Bob Peeters.

Even though Ben Haim has been an ever-present for the Addicks this season, his boss claimed the decision was a no brainer.

‘Tal Ben Haim has been superb for us this season but he won’t be available for selection on Saturday because of his religious commitments and as a club we must respect that,’ said Peeters.

‘He’s a great professional and after he approached me and asked my permission not to play in this game I decided that undoubtedly it is the right decision to let him observe Yom Kippur.’
