He has been crowned 'His Royal Cuteness' – and no wonder.

In these new pictures, taken as Prince George prepares to celebrate his last Christmas as an only child, the 17-month-old looks more adorable than ever.

Looking remarkably like his father William when he, too, was a toddler, George grins for the cameras, showing off the dimples he has inherited from his mother and more than a hint of his mischievous character.

The charming series of photographs, taken in a courtyard at Kensington Palace at the end of last month, has just been released by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

They are the first official pictures of George since his first birthday in July.

According to an aide, the pictures were taken by one of the couple's staff members, who happens to be a former professional photographer. George is dressed in a traditional white collared shirt and a navy woollen tank top featuring an appropriate guardsman design. The jumper is believed to be from Cath Kidston – and cost £20. The young Prince's outfit is completed by Rachel Riley blue shorts (£49) and his favourite navy Early Days shoes (£29).

No doubt getting George to sit still would have taken some effort on the part of the mystery photographer, although he appears to be quite the performer in front of the lens.

William and Kate, who are expecting their second baby in April, have both spoken of their son's energetic character and how he tears around Kensington Palace just like William used to do.

The Duke has described his son as 'a little bit of a rascal'. The couple do not release an official Christmas card but have distributed the latest pictures, according to aides, to thank the media for allowing Prince George to grow up 'without intrusion'.

The Cath Kidston tank top worn by Prince George had sold out before his official Christmas photographs were released - but may go on sale again.

The blue sleeveless jumper, decorated with marching guardsmen complete with bearskins and red tunics, sold out about three weeks ago and is no longer available, a spokesman for the brand said.

But it will 'possibly' be brought back following the release of the festive pictures.

The Cath Kidston spokesman said last night: 'We'll see how the demand goes. It's something we can look into. We didn't know it (the tank top) had made the cut until this evening.'

He indicated that there may be talks this week with the brand's production team about making the item available again.

It does not currently appear on the brand's website but two other tank tops for boys - one featuring the image of a police car and the other featuring the image of a dog - are discounted and are both priced at £18, having originally been £28 and £32 respectively.

Earlier this year, George's great-grandmother the Queen met designer Cath Kidston, famous for her floral prints, during a tour of the Terminal 2 building at Heathrow.

Kidston has received an MBE for creating a thriving worldwide business and helping to kick-start the trend for vintage chic.

The business, which was founded in 1993, has 160 stores including a flagship store next to the Ritz hotel in central London.

He may only be 16 months old but George has become a fashion trendsetter with the 'George effect' ensuring his outfits sell out in record time.

Within days of being born, the term was coined after the swaddling blanket he wore in his car seat as he left hospital became a hit. Sales of the printed white aden + anais cloth rose by 600 per cent in the week that followed.

In May, George topped a poll to be named most stylish child, winning 23 per cent of the vote.

The prince is following in his mother's footsteps. The Duchess of Cambridge's impact on fashion was dubbed the 'Kate effect' for boosting sales of the clothes she has worn.

George appeared in red striped dungarees - the £39.99 Stripes Short Overall by Spanish children's wear label Neck & Neck - to watch the Duke of Cambridge play polo at Cirencester Park Polo Club in Gloucestershire on Father's Day. They sold out within 24 hours.

The dungarees he wore to a New Zealand play date for his first official engagement proved equally sought after.

The £75 classic tailored dungarees with a sail boat smocked design on the front panel were by Rachel Riley, a British luxury children's brand based in Marylebone. Riley said the royal endorsement was like hitting the jackpot for her business.

During his overseas tour to New Zealand and Australia, the prince wore a white smocked romper with Peter Pan collar and sail boat decoration by Les Petites Abeilles - strikingly similar to the traditional romper suit William was seen in as a toddler in the Eighties.

A furry kangaroo backpack William was seen carrying for his son while in Sydney also sold out soon after.

Since his birth, the couple have sheltered their son from the limelight and have appealed to the media for privacy, which has been respected.

The Duke and Duchess will be at Sandringham in Norfolk with the Queen and the rest of the Royal Family for the traditional Christmas celebrations, before a planned 'second' Christmas with Kate's family at Anmer Hall, a couple of miles away.

Sources say the couple are 'enormously excited' about Christmas while Kate's sister Pippa has apparently planned party games for Prince George.

A spokesman for the couple said yesterday: 'They release pictures when it feels appropriate and to mark milestones in Prince George's life.'

Doesn't that face - and that top - look familiar?
