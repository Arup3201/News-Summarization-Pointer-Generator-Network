A foul-mouthed Harry  Redknapp threatened to sue a journalist as he angrily denied taking transfer ‘bungs’, a court heard yesterday.

The Tottenham Hotspur boss is accused of seeking to evade tax by having £189,000 of illegal payments made into a secret bank account in Monaco, which he opened in 2002 in his pet dog’s name.

Southwark Crown Court heard yesterday that Redknapp, 64, hid the existence of the account, called Rosie 47 after his dog and his year of birth, from the Inland Revenue for more than six years and from his own accountants for more than four years.

Milan Mandaric

Sheltering from the rain, Milan Mandaric also arrives at court this morning. He denies two counts of cheating the public revenue between 2002 and 2007

REDKNAPP: ‘Don’t say bung. It’s nothing to do with a bung. It’s paid by the chairman.

‘How can it be a bung when the chairman of the football club paid me?’

He added: ‘What’s a bung? It’s a f****** sick word.’

John Black, QC, prosecuting, said the 
explanation for the money paid into it had ranged from it being a bonus,
to it being an investment, a loan and a gift.

When approached in 2009 by reporter Rob Beasley over the money, he 
claimed it was a ‘bonus’ from Portsmouth FC chairman Milan Mandaric 
during his first spell as manager at the south coast club between 2002 
and 2004.

But the court heard short extracts from tape-recorded interviews with 
Beasley in which Mandaric, 73, claimed the money was for investments 
outside football, a ‘favour’ and ‘nothing to do with the club’.

Mandaric said: ‘It was something I did for my friend ... away from football.’

Mr Beasley – who was working at the now-defunct News of the World – then
contacted Redknapp, who said of his former chairman: ‘Don’t know what 
he is f****** talking about...It is a bonus.’

Redknapp told Mr Beasley the payments related to profit made on the 
£4million sale of Peter Crouch from Portsmouth to Aston Villa in 2002.

When asked if he had paid any tax in the UK on it, Redknapp replied: ‘Haven’t been asked to, Rob.’
In the same call, he claimed he had ‘the best accountants in England’ 
and said the Inland Revenue was fully aware of his dealings in tax haven
Monaco.

When Mr Beasley suggested the payment might be considered a bung, the 
jury was told Redknapp angrily replied: ‘Don’t say bung. It’s nothing to
do with a bung.

‘It’s paid by the chairman. How can it be a bung when the chairman of the football club paid me?’
He added: ‘What’s a bung? It’s a f****** sick word. I ain’t done nothing wrong ... I got paid a bonus.’

He later added: ‘Everyone knows about it, there ain’t nothing crooked in
it.’ Redknapp told Mr Beasley: ‘This money was paid by Milan in his 
American account ... it was a bonus I was due. He paid the tax on it in 
America. If you say the tax hasn’t been declared I will sue the b*******
off everyone at the News of the World, make no mistake.’

On the second day of Redknapp’s trial yesterday, the court heard how he 
failed to declare his offshore bank account to the Inland Revenue until 
2008.

The jury was also told Redknapp did not mention the Monaco account, or 
the payment into it, to his own accountant for four and a half years.

His personal banker at HSBC was left in the dark for more than five years.

Redknapp has been the subject of two separate inquiries into his finances.

The first of these, between January 2004 and November 2008, came in the 
wake of his receipt of a £300,000 ‘gift’ after Rio Ferdinand was signed 
for Leeds United from West Ham.  It was found Redknapp had paid tax on 
the payment.

He was then arrested by City of London police in June 2009 over the 
alleged payments from Milan Mandaric. Mr Black read out extracts of his 
interview at the time.

The Tottenham boss was said to have told a detective: ‘I said to him 
many, many times “Milan, I don’t want to end up with a tax bill”.

‘I was told I wasn’t liable for income tax on so many occasions.’ 
Redknapp added: ‘For the sake of that amount of money or any amount of 
money, I don’t fiddle.

‘I pay my tax since I have been in football my entire life. I pay every penny.’

Redknapp told police he had nothing to do with the account and believed money was being invested by Mandaric on his behalf.

He said Mandaric told him the investment had been a ‘disaster, disaster.
Got wiped out. There’s still a little bit in there’ and he left it at 
that. Redknapp is later said to have told police that he didn’t push the
issue but the Serbian businessman Mandaric ‘wasn’t a man to argue 
with’.

The court heard how Mandaric tried to convince police the payments sent to Redknapp were tax-free loans.

Mandaric, now the chairman at Sheffield Wednesday, asked Redknapp to 
repay about £100,000 in 2009 – weeks after   saying no comment during 
questioning by detectives about the money.

Mr Black said: ‘The Crown suggest this could be a transparent device by 
Mr Mandaric to attempt to create an impression that the money paid by Mr
Mandaric into the Rosie 47 account had only ever been advanced by way 
of a loan.’

The first charge of cheating the public purse alleges that between April
1, 2002 and November 28, 2007 Mandaric paid £93,100 into the account.

The second charge of the same offence relates to the sum of £96,300 allegedly paid between May 1, 2004 and November 28, 2007.

Both deny cheating the public revenue. The trial continues.
