A murder victim may have been pushed through a city centre in a wheelie bin before being dumped and set on fire.

Police believe the victim - who has not 
yet been identified due to severe burns - may have been killed in a 
house and then smuggled past the homes of unsuspecting neighbours.

Detectives appealed for the residents of 10 roads to contact them if they saw anything suspicious around the estate in Southampton's red light district over the Bank Holiday weekend.

Three men and a woman held on suspicion of murder were tonight being questioned over the killing.

Firefighters were called after reports of an industrial bin on fire just after 3am at the Empress Road industrial estate in Southampton yesterday.

They discovered human remains in the rubbish as they sprayed water on to the fire.

Police were then notified and 12 hours later arrested two men, aged 25 and 28, and a 20-year-old woman.

Today officers arrested a fourth suspect - a 31-year-old man. It is believed the quartet are all from the Southampton area.

The industrial bins have since been removed from the estate as police continue the hunt for evidence.

Detective Inspector Simon Baker of the Hampshire Major Investigation 
team said: 'We are now working on a theory that the victim was murdered 
sometime earlier at an address in the Bevois Mews and Earls Road area of
Southampton, and moved to the industrial estate, possibly in a wheelie 
bin.

'The exact route is not known at this stage so our latest appeal is 
focused on encouraging witnesses to come forward if they noticed any 
people pushing a wheelie bin in the area.

'We also want to hear from members of the public who may have seen 
wheelie bins being loaded into a vehicle late on Saturday or early on 
Sunday morning.'

Police want to hear from anyone who witnessed people behaving 
suspiciously in Earls Road, Cedar Road, Clausentum Road, Forster Road, 
Spear Road, Bevois Valley Road, Verulam Road, Thomas Lewis Way, Empress 
Road and Empress Road Industrial Estate.

Hunt: Officers don't know whether the dead person is a man or a woman - but a post-mortem examination is being carried out

A complex post-mortem examination was continuing to establish the gender
and identity of the body and to discover the actual cause of death.

The results were not expected until tomorrow.

A team of officers are conducting further searches and a forensic 
examination of the house where the murder is thought to have taken place
and at the scene where the body was found.

Routine house-to-house and CCTV inquiries were also underway in the local community.

A doctor formally certified the victim dead at the scene and forensic officers cordoned off the 
scene close to the waterfront yesterday afternoon as they launched an 
investigation.

A spokesman for the fire service said that only one vehicle was sent to the scene to put out the blazing bin.

Police have appealed to sex workers who use the area as well as the public for help in solving the murder.
