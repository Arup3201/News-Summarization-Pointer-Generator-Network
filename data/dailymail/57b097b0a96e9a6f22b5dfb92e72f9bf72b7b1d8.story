Greg Dyke has gone on the offensive over the FIFA World Cup corruption whitewash by urging world football’s high command to insist on investigator Michael Garcia’s report being published in full.

The FA chairman says FIFA cannot go on in their present state and full transparency on all bids is ‘a matter of urgency.’

Dyke’s letter to 26 members of the FIFA ExCo follows ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert’s findings being rubbished by Garcia himself, causing a meltdown in Zurich. 

FA chairman Greg Dyke has written to every FIFA executive committee member about the corruption report 

Dyke has every reason to go on the attack as Eckert’s conclusions, which cleared Qatar and Russia to stage the World Cups in 2018 and 2022, attached most blame for damaging the integrity of the bidding process to England 2018.

Other countries — notably Russia and Spain — who failed to co-operate with Garcia were let off almost scot-free.

Dyke, who described Eckert’s judgement as a joke, says in his letter: ‘I am writing to each member of the FIFA ExCo to urge you to insist on the publication of Mr Garcia’s full report as a matter of some urgency.

‘As you probably know the reputation of FIFA was already low in England and much of Europe before the events of last week. The failure to publish Mr Garcia’s report and his statement that the summary report contained “numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations” has resulted in further decline in public confidence of FIFA. 

There have been calls for UEFA to boycott the 2018 World Cup, but it will be hosted by a UEFA member

FIFA president Sepp Blatter previously said criticisms of the organisation were motivated by racism

‘Complete transparency is required if the actions of all those who bid, including England 2018, are to be judged fairly.’

Dyke, who led the attack against FIFA president Sepp Blatter before the FIFA Congress last summer when he accused the English press of being racist, continued: ‘I know some of you believe FIFA’s reputation in England is the result of an obsession amongst the English media with FIFA, and I know Mr Blatter sees their reports as an unfair attack on the organisation he leads.

‘However, if you read a whole range of English newspaper reports about FIFA, they do provide compelling evidence of wrongdoing. They cannot be simply dismissed as “racist” or “an attack on FIFA”, as Mr Blatter described them.

‘Urgent action is needed if confidence in FIFA is to be rebuilt in England.’ 

David Bernstein said the decision to give the 2022 World Cup to Qatar was 'ludicrous'

There was no reaction at FIFA to Dyke’s broadside. They are in unchartered territory with the civil war between their two ethics chambers — investigatory and adjudicatory. And FIFA can hide behind their lack of comment as Garcia has started his appeal process of Eckert’s alleged misrepresentation of his report, though the pair will meet later this week to sort out their major differences.

Meanwhile, Dyke’s predecessor David Bernstein has urged European nations to boycott the 2018 World Cup unless FIFA undergoes serious reform.

He said: ‘If I was at the FA now, I would do everything to encourage other nations within UEFA to take this line.

‘At some stage you have to do something. It sounds drastic but choosing Qatar was clearly one of the most ludicrous decisions in the history of sport.’

To add to the FIFA fiasco, two minor whistleblowers, Australia’s Bonita Mersiades and Qatar’s Phaedra Al Majid, have made a formal complaint to FIFA that their promises of confidentiality have been breached by Eckert’s judgement, claiming it makes them easily identifiable.
