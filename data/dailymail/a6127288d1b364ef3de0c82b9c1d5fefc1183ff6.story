A hero dog saved the life of her companion by refusing to leave his side for three days after he was shot 38 times with a lead pellet gun.

The two-year-old pointer cross found the four-year-old setter cross with only his head above water after being left for dead in a ditch on the Greek island of Zakynthos.

The loyal dog went three days without food and barked continuously on a nearby grass verge to try and alert passers-by to her companion's plight.

It worked and a walker finally came to the rescue of the dogs, with both being taken into care by Greek vets.

The dogs became inseparable and have now been nicknamed Romeo and Juliet, after moving to Holbrook Animal Rescue in Horsham, West Sussex.

Kind-hearted members of the public who read about the tale on Facebook donated to a Go Fund Me page which enabled the rescue centre to fly them over to Gatwick Airport. They had previously been looked after by rescuers Zante Stray during their time on the Greek island.

Romeo, who was hit 38 times with a lead pellet gun, was put on strong medication for ten days and his condition has now started to improve.

Laura Santini, of Holbrook Animal Rescue, said: 'Romeo was very sick and poorly for a while but thankfully he is much better now.

'He got shot and was in danger but I think she would have starved before leaving him. She was there for three days and that is a long time for a dog not to eat.

'He was underwater, he was dying and it was dismal. It is amazing the vets managed to save him.

Laura Santini, of Holbrook Animal Rescue in Horsham, West Sussex, said it was rare for dogs to bond to such an extent. She said Romeo (left) and Juliet (right), named by the centre) had been inseparable since arriving

The dogs, who were both believed to be stray while living on the Greek island, are now back to good health 

'The rescuers weren't expecting to take Juliet as well when they turned up but there was no way she was going to be left behind.

'We all thought they would probably start to play with the other dogs and make new friends but the more I look at them I don't think they will ever be apart.'

The 49-year-old said it was rare for dogs to bond to such an extent.

She said: 'They are as lovely as they were described to us and there was no exaggeration as to how close they are.

'I think they were friends before the accident. It is very rare for two dogs who don't know each other to be so inseparable. I think they must have lived together.

'They are unusual. We rescue hundreds of dogs and it is rare to get such a bond.

'It is one of the cutest stories I have ever been involved in and I am glad it has worked out happy in the end and we have got them here safely.'

It is believed both dogs were strays but it is not clear who carried out the brutal attack.

The rescue centre is now appealing for a new owner for the dogs to come forward.
