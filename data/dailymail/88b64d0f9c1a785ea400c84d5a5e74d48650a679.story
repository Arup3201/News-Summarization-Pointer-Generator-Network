This is the moment a biker knocked himself out for three minutes after misjudging a hillside jump and landing on his head.

Dominic Yannoni was captured on his helmet camera riding downhill at Whistler Mountain Bike Park in British Columbia, western Canada.

He was filmed speeding down a narrow, rocky track, before successfully landing three jumps.

The crash took place at Crabapple Hits, an 'Expert/Pro' track at Whistler, which features 120 miles of twisty, hazard-laden trails through spruce forest and over rock.

Mr Yannoni, who is believed to have made a full recovery, later uploaded the video of the incident to YouTube, writing: 'I was knocked out for three minutes.

'A special thanks to Whistler's Bike Patrol and my riding buddies - Dave, Greg, Jay and Jamie.'
