Thousands of motor-sports fans watched in horror after an amateur 
racing driver died in a crash during a historic touring car race.

Christian Devereux’s 1965 Mini Cooper S spun off course and crashed into another vehicle - believed to be a Ford Mustang - at the famous Donington Park circuit in Derby, yesterday.

Eye-witnesses claimed the collision appeared to be tame and not uncommon in the festival, but the 51-year-old motor-enthusiast died at 4.30pm after ‘succumbing to his injuries’.

Tragedy: Christian Devereux’s 1965 Mini Cooper S spun off course crashed into another vehicle - believed to be a Ford Mustang. He was racing alongside more than 20 other pre 1966 touring cars

The race, which included more than 20 pre-1966 touring cars, was stopped by marshals after Mr Devereux, of Chiswick, London, was found critically injured in his vehicle on a bend known as 'Coppice Corner'.

He had attended the event with friends to remember Brazilian three-time Formula One world champion Senna who was killed in 1994.

The race was part of Donington’s 
Historic Festival, which has been running all weekend, and attracted 
visitors from around the UK.

Two air ambulances were called to the scene.

Police and the circuit are working together to determine the cause of the crash, a spokesman for Donington Park said.

Leicestershire police last night said they are not in a position to release any further details.

A spokesman said: 'We are aware of the incident but will not be releasing any further information at this time.'

Race organisers are Donington Park

Racing Limited, operators of Donington Park Circuit, have to report

circuit’s medical and emergency services, will now be co-operating with 
both the Leicestershire Police and motorsport’s governing body, the 
Motor Sports Association, in order to determine the cause of this tragic
accident.'

Popular event: The smash cast a black cloud over the 
three-day Donington Historic Festival, which started on Friday and was 
dedicated to the memory racing idol Senna

Mr Deveraux founded a motorbike hire company in 1994 called Hexagon Motorcycles.

Nobody was available for comment from the firm yesterday.

After the accident race fans took to internet forums to pay their 
respects to Mr Deveraux - who had been due to take part in the Pau 
Historique racing festival in France next weekend.

Terence Bower wrote: 'Devastating news, Christian was one of the nicest 
people you could wish to meet, sincerest condolences to his family.

'Thoughts also with the people who dealt with the incident, whom I’m sure did everything possible.'

Fellow racing driver Roger Wills said: 'I was in the race and saw the 
aftermath. What a tragic and horrific end to a great weekend racing. 
Christian was a great guy. My thoughts are with his family and friends. 
Just awful. RIP.'

While friend Mike Bell added: 'He was a family man. Always ready for a chat at circuits and enthusiastic to the core.'

One witness, who did not want to be named, told the Derby Telegraph newspaper: 'I saw the crash happen and, to be honest, it was no worse than the type of collisions you see at the course on any given week.

'You knew it was serious when the race was cancelled and the red flags were raised.'

The smash cast a black cloud over the three-day Donington Historic Festival, which started on Friday and was dedicated to the memory racing idol Senna.

Twenty years ago, the Brazilian driver won the European Grand Prix at the circuit when he stormed from fifth to first on the opening lap to notch one of his finest victories.

He won the race by more than a minute in wet conditions.

But, less than a year later, he died in the San Marino Grand Prix, following a crash.

One of the driver’s former cars, a Lotus, was on display at Donington this weekend. Senna had won the 1985 Portuguese Grand Prix in it.
