January was the month for drastic action. Twice as many people as last year — 40,000 — signed up to a campaign organised by Alcohol Concern and gave up booze. Another 50,000 did the same via Cancer Research.

Every woman I know has bought a juicer, is on a diet or has started some brutal new form of exercise or other. Our Prime Minister is running every other day to get rid of his festive flab. Even Pippa Middleton has signed up for punishing ‘hot yoga’ classes in London given by an extraordinary-looking chap with dreadlocks.

But exercising, giving up carbs and shunning fast food and booze isn’t enough for some folk: according to people who monitor trends, the hottest form of self-improvement in 2015 involves stripping away non-essential clutter from our lives, and living with just the bare essentials instead.

Janet Street-Porter took on board the advice given by James Wallman in his new book 'Stuffocation' with some interesting results 

Devotees have been dubbed ‘experientalists’ — a horrible word which describes the knack of living through real experiences rather than accumu- lated possessions.

A book entitled Stuffocation, Living More With Less, by James Wallman — an author and ‘trend forecaster’ — has just been published, and has attracted a lot of attention.

Mr Wallman is an evangelist for this new lifestyle, claiming we will be happier and healthier if we bought less, chucked out or sold the stuff we never use, and spent our time enjoying life through doing things, either alone or with friends and family, rather than wielding our credit cards.

Wallman claims not to be anti-consumerism, but advises that before every purchase, we must ask ourselves ‘Do I really need this? Will it make me happy or just bring debt and depression?’ — presumably when we can’t pay the bill.

A book entitled Stuffocation, Living More With Less, by James Wallman, an author and ‘trend forecaster’ has attracted a lot of attention recently

He wants us to monitor our wardrobes every month and eliminate everything we haven’t worn. He’s very keen on expressions like focusing our minds ‘in the zone’.

This ‘zone’ means living in the present, enjoying whatever activity you are doing to the full. Opting for adventure over repetition. Doing new things and enjoying new experiences, instead of just shopping. Travelling and broadening our horizons, learning new skills, instead of addictively purchasing stuff we don’t need.

Wallman says there’s no such thing as retail therapy, advocating that we only purchase stuff we can use to achieve a life-enhancing goal, like a bicycle or a guitar.

He reckons we’ve all accumulated so much detritus that it is suffocating us, hence the title of the book.

In fact, the ‘living-with-less’ movement has been gathering steam for some time.

It started in the U.S. and Canada, particularly among those who worked in the new tech industries, who believed that modern technology meant it was possible to live with much less stuff.

These minimalists give away or trade all their possessions, apart from laptops, iPads, Kindles, a few items of clothing, and a mattress, and live in small rented flats.

Hardcore minimalists — called Tech Nomads — say things like ‘the internet has replaced my need for an address’ and carry their belongings around in a backpack, sleeping on friends’ sofas. They claim that all they need is a hard drive and a change of pants. One man, Dave Bruno, even wrote a book entitled The 100 Thing Challenge, subtitled How I Got Rid Of Almost Everything, Remade My Life And Regained My Soul.

Sounds tempting, doesn’t it? Achieving happiness through consciously chucking out or flogging off what we no longer need. Going for the simpler (and cheaper) life.

Let’s face it, giving up booze, bread and bacon is a lot easier than giving up internet shopping.

How many times have I come in late from supper, sat down at the laptop and bingo! bought a frock that will never go over my backside, a swimming costume that would fit an elf, a full set of DVDs I will never watch, or a floor-polishing machine than has never left the box because the instructions are incomprehensible.

I’m a typical shopper, believing that every purchase is essential. Consumerism is worse than obesity, in its own way. It’s led the country to massive debt and depression.

Survey after survey shows just how much unused stuff is clogging up our homes: women own an average of 25 pairs of shoes, five of which never get worn. They just sit in the cupboard looking sad.

Two-thirds of us own kitchen gadgets that have only ever been used six times, and one in ten of all the items in our kitchens has never been used.

From sandwich makers to slow cookers, these so-called ‘aids’ are just dust-collectors.

When it comes to clothes, women have (on average) 22 items each they never wear, valued at almost £300 per person. Men are no better, hanging on to 19 items of clothing they’ve never worn.

We buy clothes that don’t fit — and then delude ourselves that we will ‘slim’ into them. Ha ha ha. We waste money on impulse buys, and then kid ourselves they are being saved for a ‘special’ occasion.

I bought an expensive silk dress because I liked the fabric, then had it altered because it made me look fat, and have never worn it because I still feel chubby in it.

To be honest, that dress was cursed, it carried a death wish. Now, I’ve recycled it to a charity shop.

Every time we buy clothes, we naively hope they possess magic properties — and will make us happier, look gorgeous, attract compliments, draw attractive people in our direction, and generally impart a feeling of well-being.

No dress can do that, particularly one bought in a hurry or after a big lunch. A dress is a dress, it can only do so much — especially if you’re over 60 and a size 14.

Janet says she doesn't think editing her life down to 100 items isn't realistic as she'd hate to give up her childhood toys like her Ken doll

The same false hopes and dreams apply to 99 per cent of my purchases, from brightly coloured sofas that turn out to be uncomfortable (but look so trendy) to self-improving books I never read — bought because the reviewer gave them five stars. So can I adopt this new minimalist mantra and avoid being suffocated by my stuff? At 68, I have certainly built up a sizeable collection, but I’m not sure I can be ruthless.

I’ve got the living room down to the bare minimum — one sofa, one table, six chairs, no rug.

Then my partner bought a cactus. Then he added another one. They ruin my pristine environment, the plant equivalent of a shedding dog, sitting in nasty saucers.

My architect-designed kitchen is pretty lean and mean, but I forgot to specify a space for a bin, so a free-standing one ruins the whole effect, especially when an unsightly plastic bag pokes out of the top.

My minimalism really goes to pot when you open a cupboard door in the bedroom. There’s not even room for one more dress. The wardrobes and shelves for sweaters and T-shirts are crammed.

I went through the whole summer thinking I had no clothes (so I bought a couple of frocks) and then in November found all my much-loved old summer dresses packed in a suitcase in the boiler room.

If I had to chuck out what I never wear — at gunpoint — I could run three charity shops for a week. As it is, I drop off two carrier-bag loads every other Saturday.

This trait runs in the family, because when my mum died, I took 40 bags of mostly unworn clothes, still in their carrier bags (largely purchased by me because she was always moaning she never had anything to wear) to the charity shops of Llandudno.

I have shoes I’ve never worn, like my purple suede Yves St Laurent brogues — a size too big. I’ve got a pink sequined cardigan that makes me look like a big fat fairy. There’s a halterneck black chiffon evening dress that shows every under-arm wrinkle.

If I can purge my wardrobe of half its contents, then I will be happier, just as Mr Wallman predicts, but when I enter my office, it’s another matter.

Filing cabinets and cupboards are full to bursting with more than 50 photo albums, half a century of diaries and notebooks, detailing every walk I’ve ever done.

There are folders of all my love-letters, all my wedding and divorce certificates. I’ve kept my school swimming certificates, my life-saving medal, and my little award for growing a daffodil in the Fifties.

I could never get rid of this ‘stuff’ — because it connects me to my past, reminds me how far I’ve come. It brings back memories of happy times and sad deaths.

The idea of editing my entire life down to 100 items like the disciples of minimalism has suddenly hit the buffers. Unless one whole filing cabinet containing a lifetime of memories could be considered a single object.

And what about my treasured Devil Bendy toy, who has come everywhere with me for years, and who sits by my computer cheering me up?

Or my Ken doll and Teddy, purchased in the village jumble sale for £2 ages ago? Little objects that are worth their weight in gold. In my head I’m a minimalist, but when it comes to my heart, it’s another matter.

Some people take it to a whole new level and refine their possessions down to 100 key items

Janet Street-Porter gives it a go before deciding, maybe this isn't for her!
