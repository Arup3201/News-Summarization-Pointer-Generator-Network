I could never understand why there was a debate about Ross Barkley. Of course he had to be in the World Cup squad – now can he force his way into the team? That is the challenge for Barkley, Raheem Sterling and Luke Shaw. I hope we get to see plenty of them in Brazil.

Shaw may have to be patient behind Leighton Baines, but Barkley and Sterling have proven this season in the Barclays Premier League that they can be game-changers.

Barkley has scored dazzling goals for his club, against Newcastle and then Manchester City, when the England manager was watching him.

Bamboozling: Ross Barkley can run with the ball with speed and that alarms opponents

The fast show: Raheem Sterling's lightning pace can frighten the life out of opposition defences

Dazzling: Ross Barkley has scores some superb goals for Everton, including this solo strike against Newcastle

Super strike: Sterling has weighed in with crucial goals this season, including this one against Norwich

Jamie Redknapp predicted his England squad earlier this month, and was just one out (but who was it?)

He has been well managed by his Everton manager, Roberto Martinez, who has rested him at times. That is the sign of a manager putting the development of a young player first.

At his best, he runs with the ball at speed, can break the lines and bamboozle defenders.

There is no point in England going to the finals, playing meekly and not laying a glove on any opponents. So let’s pick players who can damage our group rivals and beyond. Defenders do not like to deal with pace and dare – and this squad has plenty of that.

We saw how easy it was for Andrea Pirlo to pick off England and to play through them at the European Championship. The veteran Italian maestro is a magnificent holding midfielder, but will he be as comfortable if he has direct and explosive pace running at him?

England have players here who can move across the ground quickly with the ball. Not just Sterling and Barkley, but also Adam Lallana. He has enjoyed a brilliant season for his club and is now going on to the world stage.

It is an exciting squad. There are similarities with the age profile of the squad for Euro 96, a squad that lifted the nation and included young players who operated without fear. That’s what I want from this group, too.  

When I named my predicted squad last week, it included 22 of the 23 Roy Hodgson named yesterday. My only change would have been Steven Caulker for Chris Smalling, who has had a poor season. Roy obviously knows him after working with him at Fulham, so he trusts him. Smalling can also cover at full back.

There is enough experience there too, with Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard among the experienced names. And Wayne Rooney will find more space, if he has pace around him.

The stand-by players have to be ready 
too, because when did we last have a major tournament that wasn’t 
interrupted by injury in the build-up? So they have to stay sharp, 
focused and alert.

My view 
on sports psychology is mixed, but Steve Peters will also have a big 
role to play, especially with the Liverpool players.

They
 were bouncing into the World Cup, but now they are limping after what 
happened at the end of the season. Nobody more so than the captain, 
Gerrard. They will need some help to get ready for the challenges ahead.

I hope this squad can deliver a surprise in Brazil. Let’s see how far they can go.
