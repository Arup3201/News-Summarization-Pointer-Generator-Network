Dr. Ben Carson drew shouts of 'Run, Ben, Run!' Friday night with a double-barreled attack on the Barack Obama presidency that included slams on his foreign policy decisions.

The retired pediatric neurosurgeon, who has attracted a cult-like Republican following – and a presidential 'draft' committee with better fundraising numbers than the 'Ready For Hillary' PAC, that the United States needn't 'stick our nose into everybody's 
business, but we do need to lead.'

'We are the pinnacle nation of the 
world,' he told a crowd of thousands at the Western Conservative Summit in Denver, Colorado.

'There's a responsibility that comes with that, and right now the 
world is like a third-grade class with no teacher in it. And it's going 
like crazy, okay?'

Dr. Ben Carson is being prodded to run for president by a PAC that has outraised the 'Ready for Hillary' group that's advocating for Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton

Carson said his observations were mostly reflective of the Obama administration's failure to understand Middle Eastern history and intervene on the side of groups and nations that held promise to become American allies.

Like former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, he may or may not be running for the White House in 2016. But he acknowledged the growing chorus of fans who want him to take the plunge.

'There are a lot of people who come up to me and say, "Doctor, you've gotta run. You've gotta save us",' he said quietly. 'There are a lot of people who do that.'

Carson also knows how leverage his quiet charisma to appeal to red-meat conservatives.

'Our country is in critical condition right now,' the doctor said. 'And if don't do something about it in the relatively near future. It's going to be over.'

If Democratic presidents can appoint three more liberal Supreme Court justices, Carson warned, it 'is the end of the United States as we know it.'

He raised eyebrows with prescriptions to combat illegal immigration that included the use of unmanned aircraft to patrol the U.S.-Mexico border.

Under Obama's leadership, he said, 'we don't have the will to secure the border. We have what we need to do that. We have 10,000 drones. You know, we have all kinds of technological things.'

He also hinted that entitlements and the promise of free education and other social programs are a electromagnet for border-crossings that should be switched off.

'We have to reduce the incentive for people to want to come here,' he said. 'I guarantee you that if you remove all the goodies, people will find a way to get out of here just as they found a way to get in.'

And employers who hire illegal immigrants, Carson told his partisan audience, should be prosecuted criminally upon a second offense.

Conceding that immigrant workers often perform jobs that 'Americans sometimes don't want to do,' he said a solution would involve an expanded guest worker program for which applications would only be accepted if they came from outside the United States.

'There's no way that we can put people in line to become American citizens and enjoy the benefits of America who have broken the law,' he said, 'and put them in front of people who have not broken the law. That doesn't make any sense.'

The 'Draft Ben Carson' committee, a group laying the groundwork for a Carson candidacy, reported last week that it raised $3.4 million in the second quarter of 2014.

That amount eclipses the more media-savvy 'Ready for Hillary' campaign, which raised $2.5 million in seed money for a Hillary Clinton run. 

The Carson PAC's under-the-radar approach, attracting thousands of small-dollar donations, lines up with Carson's own quiet approach.

Carson was the biggest draw and Friday night's final speaker at the Western Conservative Summit in Denver

In order to combat what he called a federal government that's 'just too big,' Carson steered clear of calling for the aggressive, slashing elimination of entire cabinet agencies.

Instead,he said, federal bureaucracies can be brought to heel passively, through attrition, by a four-year freeze on hiring employees to replace government workers when they retire.

After four years – coincidentally the length of a presidential term – 'the government will be down to a lean, mean size,' he said.

'They will only have enough personnel to do what they're supposed to do, and they'll keep their big noses out of everybody's business.'

He did propose adding a new government department, 'a covert agency,' tasked with monitoring government workers and programs.

'And people who were irresponsible, lazy and unresponsive would find themselves with no job. That's the way it ought to be done.'

And overgrown government, he said, feeds off of 'absurd taxation policies' that amount to 'government's boot on the neck of business and industry.'

'People go into business to make money,' Carson said, 'not to support the government.'

'We've gotta get the White House, and we can turn this thing right around.'
