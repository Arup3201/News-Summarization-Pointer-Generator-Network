Kate Moss is using her supermodel status to raise vital funds for charity by putting her famous pout to good use.

Kate has designed a limited edition Rimmel London lipstick called Red Nose Red by Kate for Comic Relief - and shows off the glossy effects in a new campaign shoot.

Kate, 40, has given her signature and best-selling lipstick a charitable makeover and it comes complete with a dotty red and black lid.

Kate Moss, who has a best-selling lipstick range for Rimmel, has designed a limited edition one called Red Nose Red by Kate for Comic Relief - and shows off her perfect rouge pout in a new campaign shoot

The lipstick, which she says glides on thanks to its smooth, creamy texture and provides high impact colour that lasts up to eight hours, costs £5.49, with £1.67 of each sale going to Comic Relief.

Kate also starred in a video, which saw her posing in a variety of serious-looking poses while being filmed by an Andy Warhol-style photographer.

Looking into the camera, she says: 'I'm Kate Moss. Join me by wearing my new lipstick for Red Nose Day. Worn by me and my supermodel friends Cara Delevingne, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Cindy Crawford.'

At that point, funnyman David Walliams appears on the set dressed in various guises, which show a remarkable likeness to the trio of catwalk stars. 

In his incarnation of Cara he wears a leather jacket with a beanie hat and a collection of gold chains.

Acting up for the camera, he can be seen smudging his lipstick, eating make-up and pulling wacky poses.

As he larks around in high-energy mode, he also depicts her destroying the set with her antics.

As Marks and Spencer beauty Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Walliams opts for a more feminine approach, which sees him gliding around in a bra and knickers.

However, perhaps the funniest impression of them all is that of Cindy Crawford.

While strutting around in a skin-tight dress and huge wig, he shows off a hilarious - and hairy - over-sized mole on his face. 

Speaking about their charity campaign, Kate Moss said: 'We are all hoping that people will make their face funny for money, please buy the lipstick put it on your nose, put it on your cheeks, make yourself look like a clown and raise some money.'

Kate was recently spotted looking loved up with husband Jamie Hince. The pair are inseparable and always make sure to spend every moment together when Jamie's not touring.

The musician previously cited 'missing my family' as the worst part of gigging.

The couple also raise daughter Lila Grace, 12, who Kate has with her ex-partner Jefferson Hack.

'My wife is very much my sidekick,' Jamie previously told The Mirror. 'So I tend to get separation anxiety when I’m away from her.'

The pair have been lying low since enjoying a wild weekend break with their famous friends including Noel Gallagher, Nick Grimshaw and Sadie Frost.

They jetted off to Scotland to celebrate nutritionist and former model Rose Ferguson’s 40th birthday with a Burns-themed bash at the Craigellachie Hotel on the banks of the River Spey. 

Wearing a while silk top with black lace detail over the top, he encapsulated Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's frequent pouting and posing 

While strutting around as Cindy Crawford in a skin-tight dress with huge wig consisting of brunette curls, he also sports a hilarious over-sized mole on his face
