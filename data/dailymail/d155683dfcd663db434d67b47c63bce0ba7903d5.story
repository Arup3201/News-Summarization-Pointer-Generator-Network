If you've ever misplaced your wallet at home, left it in a bar or had it stolen a new smart wallet could give you some peace of mind. 

Called Woolet, the $99 (£67) pouch syncs to a phone over Bluetooth to offer five different ways to locate it when it's lost. 

This includes sending an alert to the phone, a built-in distance tracker and a 'howling' alarm to pinpoint its precise location.

The $99 (£67) Woolet syncs to a phone over Bluetooth to offers five different ways to locate it. This includes sending an alert to the phone, a built-in distance tracker and a 'howling' alarm to pinpoint its precise location

Woolet was created by Delaware-based Wooletco that has raised almost $160,000 (£108,000) on Kickstarter to fund the accessory.

It is fitted with a mini-sensor and if left behind, the phone will vibrate to warn its owner - and vice versa if the phone is lost.

And this distance can be customised, from between 20 and 85ft (six and 25 metres). 

Once an alert has been sent to the phone, a built-in distance tracker helps the owner pinpoint the Woolet's location, and clicking 'Ring to Find' will cause the wallet to emit a sound.

Plus the app will show the owner the wallet's last recorded location, and when in a crowd the Woolet sends signals to other Woolet owners so they can relay its location. 

It also has self-charging batteries.

This sound is also customisable and includes a ringer or a 'howling' noise.

It also has self-charging batteries and the company is still experimenting on whether these batteries will charge through movement or heat.

'Woolet is just 9.9mm thin, yet ready for anything,' said the designers. 

'Unlike other smart wallets, Woolet is a ‘full wallet’. This means you don’t need to compromise on what you take.

'[Plus] batteries are an essential component of any smart device but are also often its weakest component. 

'That’s why we designed self-charging batteries to provide dependable power that lasts.'

Other specifications include four credit card slots, a bank note sleeve and a hidden money pocket. It has a maximum range of 250ft (60 metres) and the app works with iOS and Android. 

Woolets can be pre-ordered for $99 (£67) from Kickstarter and are expected to ship in May this year.

Clicking 'Ring to Find' will cause the wallet to emit a sound, and the app can reveal the wallet's last recorded location. Additionally, when lost in a crowded place the Woolet will beam signals to other Woolet owners so they can relay its location to the original owner
