With its 144-year history of sporting excellence, luxury surrounds and high-rolling clientele, the last thing most would expect to escape from the ornate doors of New York Athletic Club is allegations of sexual harassment and racial abuse.

Employees' claims, given as sworn testimony in a lawsuit, tell of wild partying, derogatory slurs and brawling at the members-only gym.

The allegations appear to have so horrified those at the elite club that they tried legal action to keep the information coming out in the public domain - but to no avail.

Members only: The reputation of the elite New York Athletic Club has been blighted by a sexual harassment lawsuit and reports of a brawl among members in April

Speaking out: Keisi Ballenilla has brought a sexual harassment lawsuit against her former employer, the New York Athletic Club

One employee and one former worker of
the Manhattan sports club have come forward to reveal that members 
would use the N-word and female employees feared being sexually harassed
- but no action was taken by NYAC management against their wealthy 
clients. 

The two men gave sworn testimony in the lawsuit brought by former waitress Keisi Ballenilla against the club, where it costs $8,500 to join and $3,000 a year in fees.

Many employees refused to come 
forward fearing they would lose their jobs at the elite 
establishment which sits on the edge of Central Park, according to 
transcripts seen by the New York Post.

The
legal bid paints the club - which was founded in 1868, and boasts 231 
Olympic medals won by its members - in a less than decorous light.

Club
managers were said to have swept employees' complaints about 
inappropriate behavior under the carpet, according to the 
depositions.

Managers were also complicit in the wild partying and drinking at the club, the suit claims.

Elvis Lopez, who has worked as a security man at 
the club for seven years, said management and club members discriminated
against staff, according to the Post.

Mr Lopez said that employees would be called racial slurs by guests and that one female employee was routinely shown images of half-naked men by guests - but no action was taken.

The high life: Members of the NYAC, which sits on the edge of Central Park in Manhattan, costs $8,500 just to join

Miss Ballenilla, who worked at 
the club for five years, has alleged that she was continually subjected 
to sexual harassment by managers, singling out one boss Nesim Zuberi in particular.

The New York Athletic Club had tried to keep the lawsuit out of public knowledge with a confidentiality order but it was rejected by a Manhattan court.

MailOnline contacted the athletic club but calls were not returned at this time.

It is not the first time that the club has found itself involved in criminal proceedings.

In April, a rowdy bar-room brawl broke out among members, allegedly over a girl. Beginning
in the 'Tap Room' bar of the NYAC, the fight resulted in the arrest of 
three men, with two reported broken noses and ten police being called to
cart off the angry fitness enthusiasts.

One witness wrote on the blog WallStreetJackass: ‘It was the best fight I've ever seen. Young people, old people, girls, members, non-members, it was a nondiscriminatory ragematch.

'Not sure the reason but it seemed to be over a girl.'

With no word on why the fight broke out, the club apparently had to deal with 'glasses thrown' around the room and a woman cut badly enough to require stitches.

Emergency services did admit that in the early morning hours on April 13 a man with a cut head was transported to New York Downtown Hospital and one other man with unspecified injuries arrived at St. Luke’s-Roosevelt Hospital Center.

The New York Times reported that when the dust cleared, Peter Doran, 28, and Matthew O’Grady, 31, were arrested and charged with third-degree assault and second-degree harassment.

Also arrested was Colin Drowica, 30, thought to be a brokerage director who was charged with attempted menacing after he allegedly clutched a security guard's arm and threatened him.

The club also attempted to keep this embarrassing incident under wraps.

The New York Athletic Club was founded in 1868 and has approximately 8,600 members.

Its main location is at 1800 Central Park South in Manhattan, a few blocks from the Plaza Hotel and the designer stores of 5th Avenue.

There is a summer location for the club on Travers Island in Westchester County - an exclusive outpost nestled among upstate mansions and marinas packed with yachts.

The Mad life: Don Draper (played by John Hamm) stands outside the New York Athletic Club in an episode of Mad Men

The club's long-established reputation as a haven of classy R&R has turned it into a renowned facet of the glamorous New York City lifestyle.

In season four of Mad Men, Don Draper (played by John Hamm) is seen doing laps of the pool at the New York Athletic Club - and later smoking under the awnings and ogling women walking by.

Real-life members of the NYAC include Robert Ripley who created the tourist attraction Ripley's Believe It or Not!

Other notable members were Broadway star George M Cohan, four-time Olympic discus champion Al Oerter, wrestler Bruce Baumgartner and polo player Wolf Wigo.

The Central Park building has 24-floors, two restaurants, one cocktail lounge, a library, ballroom and eight floors of guest rooms for members.

Members have won 230 Olympic Games Medals - including 120 gold. Forty former members competed at the Beijing Olympics and brought home 16 medals.  It costs $8,500 to join and to retain membership costs $3,000 annually.
