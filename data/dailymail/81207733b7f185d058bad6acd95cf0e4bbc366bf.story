Marcos Rojo said he is honoured to play for the 'world's biggest club' - Manchester United - in the 'world's most exciting league'.

The 24-year-old joined Louis van Gaal's side in a £16million deal that also saw Nani move to Sporting Lisbon on a season-long loan.

'It is such an honour to say that I now play for Manchester United,' he said. 'The Premier League is the most exciting league in the world and to have the chance to play in it for the world's biggest club is a dream for me.

Rojo began his career at Estudiantes in his home country before moving to Spartak Moscow in 2011. After just one season in Russia he moved to Portugal with Sporting Lisbon. After an impressive World Cup he has now sealed a move to Manchester United, where, he feels, he can develop as a player.

'I have joined United to work hard with my team-mates to win trophies and I know that the manager shares that ambition.'
