Nothing feels more summery than kicking off your shoes and walking on grass.

But should you have no idyllic meadow to frolic in, then these new flip-flops could be the answer.

The soles are lined with surprisingly lifelike synthetic grass, giving you the feeling of strolling across a freshly mown lawn whether you're indoors or out.

The grass is greener: These flip-flops from Firebox will give you that barefoot-on-the-grass feeling even when you're padding around your living room

The shoe comes in men's and women's versions, with a rugged green strap for chaps and a charming daisy for women.

It's not exactly like going barefoot in the park, but for a touch of nature with no need to water or mow, it's not a bad substitute.

Just don't take them off while sitting on the lawn, as it will be tricky to find them again.
