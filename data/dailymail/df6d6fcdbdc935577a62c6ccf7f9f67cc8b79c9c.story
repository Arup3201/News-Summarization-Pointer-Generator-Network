The report by Hope Not Hate, said Anjem Choudary, above, should be considered a 'major player' in international Islamism

Groups linked to hate preacher Anjem Choudary have been labelled, the 'single biggest gateway to terrorism in recent British history'.

The radical Islamist has been identified as the link between groups who encourage the safe passage of British and European Muslims into Syria where they join Al Qaeda-linked forces.

According to a study by Hope Not Hate, organisations affiliated with Choudary have encouraged in the region of 80 young British Muslims to join the fighting in Syria.

They may also have had a hand in the recruitment of 300 more on the continent, the report said.

As well as highlighting Choudary role in encouraging young Muslims to fight in Syria, the report also established a connection between the preacher's al-Muhajiroun network and high profile terrorists, including those repsonsible for the 7/7 London bombings.

The report recommends that Mr Choudary should be considered a 'serious player' in the promotion and recruitment of young Muslims to terrorist cells.

Previously, the father-of-four from Leytonstone in East London has made statements about how he would like to see the Prime Minister David Cameron and the American President Barack Obama killed.

Despite his bile-filled speeches and controversial views, the 46-year-old has only ever been fined £500 by the authorities.

That action came after he organised a protest outside the Danish embassy in London over cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed.

But the latest investigation will raise fresh questions about Choudary's influence in the radicalisation of British Muslims who go on to carry out acts of terrorism.

Speaking to The Independent, a spokesman for Hope Not Hate, said supporters of the preacher were currently in Syria 'in numbers'.

They said: 'Al-Muhajiroun supporters from London, Birmingham, Luton and Stoke-on-Trent have all definitely gone.

Choudary has previously made hate-filed statements in which he said he would like David Cameron to be killed

'While painted by some as a figure of fun, an extremist crackpot whose media stunts are rightly ridiculed, Anjem Choudary has become a serious player on the international Islamist scene

'Perhaps it is time to start concentrating on his role as a facilitator of terror. Al-Muhajiroun has quite simply been the single biggest gateway to terrorism in recent British history.'

Choudhary has previously been identified as a leading British influence for the Al Qaeda-linked 
terrorists who carried out the Kenya shopping mall atrocity.

He featured significantly in a video issued by the East African group and was was lauded as a ‘Caller to Islam’, marking the first time that he has been publicly endorsed by Al Qaeda.

It suggested that he and a militant colleague based in North-West London are the main points of contact for Muslims eager to wage jihad in Somalia or Britain.

In the clip, Choudary is seen blaming British foreign policy for terrorist attacks in the UK and warning of more attacks.

Speaking in the video, thought to be taken from the internet, he says: ‘The Government want people to swallow something that is completely nonsensical, it doesn’t make any sense: their foreign policy has had a direct impact on the streets of London.’
