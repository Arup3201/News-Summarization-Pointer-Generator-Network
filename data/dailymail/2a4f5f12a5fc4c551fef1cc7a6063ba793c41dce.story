A newly released satellite image shows the shocking scale of destruction caused by the Washington state landslide that struck the small town of Oso on March 22.

Google Earth had been trying to get a clear view of the landslide since it first happened, but overcast skies prevented a clear view until March 31.

The pool of sludge measuring about 300 acres, which wiped out the mountainside community when it struck on a Saturday morning, stands out against the greenery of the surviving trees.

About 500 rescue workers are still sifting through the debris, in some places 75ft high, as they search for 22 people who are still listed as missing.

Snohomish County has put the current death toll at 27, and 19 of the victims have since been identified. All died from multiple blunt-force trauma, Live Science reported.

'This disaster is quickly becoming one 
of the worst in state history,' Washington Governor Jay Inslee said.

The landslide was triggered when the waterlogged hillside collapsed at the Stillaguamish river, which is about 50 miles from Seattle.

Among the devastation and huge loss of life, there have been a few remarkable stories of survival, like that of Duke Saddarth, a 22-week-old baby who was plucked from the sludge by a driver who was passing as the landslide hit.

Kody Wesson ignored state troopers' advice to stay away, and managed to pull the baby and his mother Amanda Skorjanc to safety.

'You gotta help 'em. How can you not? What are you supposed to do, you can't just stand there and watch,' Mr Wesson told the Atlanta Journal Constitution. 

Three men rescued from the landslide are still in hospital. A 37-year-old is in serious condition in
 intensive care. An 81-year-old in serious condition in intensive care. 
And a 58-year-old is in satisfactory condition.

The
 family of the mother and baby released a statement through the 
hospital, saying: 'We are so grateful to all the responders who 
jeopardized their safety in order to pull Duke and Amanda out of the 
debris. 

'Words alone 
cannot tell you how thankful we are. Our hearts and support continue to 
go out to everyone who has been affected by this tragedy.'

The
 scale of the disaster is so huge that the sniffer dogs that have been 
essential to rescue efforts had to take a break after several long days 
of working through the cold mud in nearly nonstop rain.

'The
 conditions on the slide field are difficult, so this is just a time to 
take care of the dogs,' Kris Rietmann, lead spokeswoman for the 
team working on the eastern portion of the slide, said.

If the dogs become worn out they lose their ability to locate human scent among the mud. Dogs from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which only arrived recently, will continue to work at the scene while the others take a two-day break.

This
 weekend, crews completed a makeshift road that will link one side of 
the debris field to the other, significantly easing the recovery 
operation. They have also been working to clear mud and debris from the 
highway.

Searchers have had to contend with treacherous conditions. The search area has septic tanks, gasoline, propane tanks and other hazards. When rescuers and search dogs leave, they have to be hosed off by hazardous materials crews stationed at the edges of the debris field.
