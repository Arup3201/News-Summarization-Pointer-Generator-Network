A gang member who killed his former schoolfriend by mounting the pavement and driving at him in a stolen car has been jailed for 24 years today.

The judge said Kyle Beckford had shown no remorse for the murder of 19-year-old Delaney Brown, who was part of a rival gang.

Beckford, 22, had pleaded guilty to manslaughter but a jury at Luton Crown Court found him guilty of murder.

Beckford rammed a stolen BMW into Mr Brown, as he rode along the pavement and sent him hurtling into a brick gate post where the force broke his neck.

He died within moments of being hit on September 5, last year.

The pair had been friends while pupils at Denbigh High School in Luton but later became part of rival gangs.

Mr Brown was a member of the Lewsey Farm Gang, sometimes known as The Trap Gang, while Beckford was a member of the Marsh Farm Gang.

Judge Richard Foster told Beckford there was 'no excuse' for gang culture in Luton.

He said: 'You showed a 
complete lack of remorse. Any tears are for the position you now find 
yourself in and not for the death of Delaney Brown.'

The judge added: 'There can be no excuse for the men of this town to live in this gang culture.'

The court heard Mr Brown had been cycling along the pavement in Vincent Road on a stolen bike when Beckford spotted him.

Witnesses said Beckford was in the car with other people but refused to name any of them in court.

Flowers and empty bottles of alcohol were left on the pavement where Mr Brown was hit from behind and died

Stuart Trimmer QC prosecuting said: 'He
deliberately rammed the bike with sufficient force to lock the two 
together, deforming the rear wheel of the bike and propelling the body 
of Delaney Brown forward with considerable force.'

He added: 'This was a deliberate murder. The weapon 
chosen was the car. The method of use of that weapon demonstrates the 
deliberate nature of the murder.'

Judge Foster said Mr Brown's gang had shown 'disrespect' weeks before his death at the funeral of Beckford's grandfather.

He told Beckford: 'You were determined to give the Lewsey Farm Gang a lesson. You were anxious to exert your supremacy.'

The
judge said he could not be sure Beckford had been 'hunting' for Delaney 
Brown on the day he died as the prosecution suggested.

'But when you 
saw him alone and on his bicycle, you took your opportunity. If it had 
not been then, it would have been another time,' he said.

He said Mr Brown had pedalled furiously in an attempt to get away, but Beckford had 
driven after him and mounted the pavement as he got closer.

'Delaney Brown must have been petrified in those last few seconds of his life,' he said.

Judge Foster also paid tribute to witnesses who had given evidence at the trial, albeit anonymously.

Both Mr Brown and Beckford had appeared in YouTube videos for their respective gangs and in the weeks leading up to Mr Brown's death there had been a number of 'violent incidents between these groups'.

Mr Brown's home, where he lived with his grandmother Doreen Taylor, had been targeted by the Marsh Farm gang months earlier and the kitchen window had been smashed the front door damaged.

On another the police were called after the two gangs clashed with machetes.

Stuart Trimmer QC prosecuting told the court gang members and their parents had previously held a meeting to try and calm the situation.

In the witness box Beckford denied 'hunting down' Delaney saying he had only wanted to scare him.

He said suspected he had been involved in an 'ambush' of his cousin by a group of young men from Hockwell Ring some weeks before.

He said: 'He was involved and he was telling me he wasn't. I didn't want to kill him or seriously harm him. He was my friend.'

Beckford had earlier pleaded guilty during the trial to the manslaughter of his former school friend but the jury found him guilty of murder.
