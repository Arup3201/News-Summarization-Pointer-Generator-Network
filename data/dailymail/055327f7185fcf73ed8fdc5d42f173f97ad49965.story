The Kirkuk province security committee announced a curfew beginning at 10am (7am GMT), saying it will be in effect until further notice.

A car bomb also exploded near security headquarters in central Kirkuk city, wounding five people, a police colonel and the doctor said.

According to the colonel, suicide bombers who were also armed with other weapons tried to take up positions on the roof of a hotel in the city, but were killed by security forces before they could do so.

Meanwhile, security sources said at least 18 people were killed when two bombs went off in Baghdad's Bab al-Sharqi district on Friday morning, home to a large market and across the Tigris river from the Green Zone, which houses most government buildings.

Bombings are frequent in Baghdad, where Sunni insurgents from Islamic State, which controls large swathes of territory in Iraq's north and west, regularly conduct suicide attacks.

Police officials say the Friday morning attack started with a bomb exploding near carts selling used clothes in the city's central Bab al-Sharqi area. 

The second explosion, caused by a car bomb, went off two minutes later targeting people who rushed to help the victims from the first blast.

Three civilians were later killed and at least 10 others wounded in northwestern Baghdad when mortars landed in residential neighbourhoods, police and medics said.

Police in the holy city of Samarra, about 125 km (80 miles) north of the capital, said two suicide bombers targeted a security checkpoint in the city centre, killing three and wounding five members of the police and Shi'ite militias.

Police say they thwarted a third suicide attack by shooting a suspected militant.

But clashes broke out on the western outskirts of Samarra following another explosion, with police and militias battling Islamic State fighters.

Samarra holds potent symbolism for Iraqis. 

In February 2006 Sunni militants blew up a shrine to the ninth century Imam Askari, triggering revenge attacks by Shi'ites which tipped Iraq into years of sectarian violence.

Iraq is facing its worst crisis since the 2011 withdrawal of U.S. troops. 

Militants from the Islamic State group now control about a third of the country.
