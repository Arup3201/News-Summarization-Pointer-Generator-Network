Criticised: Trendy American clothing giant American Apparel has been criticised by the advertising watchdog for an advert which 'appeared to sexualise a child' - a week after falling foul of the same issue

Trendy American clothing giant American Apparel has been criticised by the advertising watchdog for an advert which 'appeared to sexualise a child' - a week after falling foul of the same issue.

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld two complaints about 
the advert, which appeared on the back cover of Vice Magazine.

It pictured a girl sitting on an office chair wearing a jumper, knickers
 and knee-length socks. She was posed with her legs up on the chair and 
her knickers were visible.

The latest ruling comes a week after the clothing brand fell foul of the
 ASA with campaigns featuring 'gratuitous' images and the sexualisation 
of models who appeared to be under 16.

American Apparel ran into similar
 issues with campaigns in 2009 and earlier this year.

The people who complained about the advert on the back of Vice Magazine objected that it was offensive and irresponsible.

American Apparel denied that, saying the model featured was over 18 and 
was wearing products that were meant for adult consumers.

They said they
 placed the ad in Vice Magazine, a publication written for adults, and 
the model wore clothes which were available for sale in their stores and
 online, in this case underwear and a sweater.

Vice Magazine also did not believe the advert was offensive or 
irresponsible.

They said it featured a woman wearing socks, underwear 
and a top and there was nothing to suggest anything overtly sexual or 
inappropriate was being portrayed.

They also pointed out it contained no
 nudity. American Apparel has since confirmed to them that the model was
 over 18.

The ASA said the model pictured appeared to be young and potentially under the age of 16.

It said: 'Whilst we acknowledged the image did not contain any explicit 
nudity, we considered that the amateur style of the photo, the posing of
 the model with her legs up on an office style chair with her knickers 
showing and the unsmiling expression on the model’s face meant the photo
 would be interpreted as having sexual undertones and a voyeuristic 
quality.

'We concluded the ad inappropriately sexualised a model who appeared to be a child and was therefore irresponsible.

'We had not seen demographic data for Vice Magazine but understood it 
was intended for an adult audience. However, we concluded that because 
it appeared to sexualise a child the ad was likely to cause serious or 
widespread offence in a magazine that was untargeted and freely 
available.

Removed: This image on the American Apparel website was ruled offensive by the ASA

Banned: Bosses at American Apparel were previously ordered to ditch this image used on its website after the Advertising Standards Authority ruled it was offensive

'The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told American 
Apparel not to depict any model as inappropriately sexualised who could,
 through their appearance or styling, appear to be a child.'

A spokesman for American Apparel said: 'It’s unfortunate that the ASA 
has made this ruling as our models are clearly of age and were featured 
in Vice Magazine, a publication clearly intended for mature, fashion 
forward audiences.

'Obviously we’ll abide by this ruling as we have in the past with 
similar ASA decisions, but American Apparel will not be altering our 
classic advertising aesthetic which is internationally recognised for 
its artistic and social values.'
