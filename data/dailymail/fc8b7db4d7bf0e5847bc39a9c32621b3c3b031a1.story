A passenger on a flight bound for New York has been heard screaming about CIA secrets and NSA leaker  Edward Snowden after an audio tape of the terrifying ordeal was revealed today.

Daniel Perry was physically restrained by other passengers after he stood up and began frantically shouting ten hours into the 16-hour United Airlines flight from Hong Kong.

Another passenger filmed the disturbance with a cell phone on which Perry can be heard ranting: 'My name is Daniel Morgan Perry... they take my stuff away, then I become an unperson.'

Flight ordeal: A passenger filmed the moment that passengers had to restrain Perry when he started ranting about the CIA and NSA, ten hours into a 16-hour flight from Hong Kong to the U.S.

The audio tape, which shows several male passengers standing in a darkened cabin, was posted on newsflare.com.

In a hoarse voice, Perry reportedly shouts: 'They are trying to kill me, they are trying to kill me. Please, my parents do not know I am on this flight.'

He then gives his mother and father's phone numbers along with his own social security number and Hong Kong ID and address.

He gave his wife's phone number and said that she was in danger because she is a Chinese national. 

He also cries out: 'China is a better country... I know this now because I saw something wrong and I went to my consulate and instead of helping my country they didn't see it that way, they want to silence me.'

Perry also claimed that he is an 
employee of a U.S. embassy in the Middle East.

His Facebook profile reveals that Perry is from Binghamton, New York but currently lives in Hong Kong.

In custody: A passenger on a flight from Hong Kong is arrested at the Newark airport on Monday

The suspect is seen in blue being led out of the airplane by law enforcement authorities

The passenger stood up and made the statement several hours into the trip and the flight crew decided to continue on to Newark

Jacques Roizen, one of a handful of people who were forced to restrain the man, told ABC News that the man was frightened and believed he had been poisoned.

Mr Roizen told the local TV station that Perry had been shouting that he had secrets from the CIA and repeatedly mentioned the name of NSA leaker Edward Snowden.

He pleaded for the flight to be 
diverted to Canada. Roizen and four or five other passengers, including a
 flight attendant, jumped on him when he began reaching for his pockets.

They were able to restrain him with zip 
ties and they tried to calm him down for the remainder of the flight by 
talking about their families and Father's Day, he added.

Perry was met at Newark Liberty International Airport around 2pm by more than
 a dozen federal law enforcement officials.

The passenger referred to NSA leaker Edward Snowden several times, according to one of the passengers who restrained him

The passenger is pictured with his hands zip-tied behind his back heading toward an ambulance

His hands were zip-tied behind his back as he was led out of United Airlines flight 
116 and onto the tarmac, where several police vehicles and an ambulance 
were waiting. He was wearing a dark hooded jacket, a blue shirt and 
khaki pants.

Officials say the man appeared to be 
mentally disturbed and was taken to nearby University Hospital for a 
psychiatric evaluation.

Initial reports said he had claimed on board the plane that other 
passengers had been poisoned but two witnesses said they never heard 
him make that statement.

It's not known at this point whether he 
has any ties to Edward Snowden, the 29-year-old former security 
contractor who leaked classified information to the media regarding two 
government surveillance programs. 

Snowden fled to Hong Kong on May 20 
and he is believed to still be hiding out there.

He claims he worked for
 the CIA between 2007 and 2009, before he started work as a security contractor for Booz Allen Hamilton.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control 
cleared the plane at the airport and determined there was no evidence of poison on 
board. None of the 238 passengers have reported feeling sick.

Witnesses were allowed to leave the airport after being interviewed by the FBI and Port Authority Police detectives.

Officials led the suspect, wearing a dark blue hooded jacket, to an ambulance that was on scene

There is no indication that any passengers have actually been poisoned
