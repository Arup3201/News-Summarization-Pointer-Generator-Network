Petrol prices are set to plunge to a four-year low with supermarkets cutting unleaded by 2p a litre following a huge drop in crude oil prices.

The price of a barrel of crude oil has dropped by 40 per cent in the past six month with some retailers now passing the saving on to customers.

From tomorrow, a litre of unleaded at Asda will cost 112.7p a litre, which is its cheapest price since October 2010, while diesel will cost 118.7p.

Petrol prices are set to fall to a four year low following a huge drop in the price of crude oil, with the saving being passed on to customers 

Petrol prices will have dipped 14p at Asda by the time tomorrow's cut comes into force after unleaded reached as high as 126.7p in late September.

Tesco has also announced that from today they too will be cutting 2p from the price of a litre of unleaded while diesel will also drop by 1p a litre at its 500 filling stations.

After the announcement, both Sainsbury's and Morrisons said they would be cutting 2p from their unleaded and 1p from the price of diesel.

The average price of a litre of diesel has also followed a similar pattern over the past four years, with the cost decreasing in 2014  

According to petrol comparison site petrolprices.com, the average current price for a litre of unleaded is 119p, with the average litre of diesel costing 123.8p.

And its founder Peter Zaborsky told Mailonline he is predicting that prices could fall even further as the Christmas period begins.

He said: 'It's good news that petrol prices will fall this weekend but as we head towards Christmas, the trend is that they are likely to fall further.

'So even though it is good news for this weekend, prices that are coming could be even better.

'Prices at the moment are definitely at a four to five year low.

The price of a barrel of crude oil has been rising over the past four years but has decreased quickly since the beginning of 2014 

'Once one supermarket makes a big announcement regarding their petrol prices, the other retailers all follow.' 

But despite the fall in prices at the supermarkets, drivers in some parts of the country are paying vastly more for their field than others.

Petrolprices.com shows that the cheapest price of unleaded currently being offered is for 113.9p with the most expensive at 139.9p.

The cheapest litre of diesel is being sold for 123.8p and the most expensive is at 148p.  

Asda say that from tomorrow the price of a litre of unleaded at one of their forecourts will be 112.7p, while diesel will cost 118.7p 

Critics complain that fuel prices soar like a rocket when oil is high but float down 'like a feather' when it falls.

Experts said some prices were genuinely high because of the higher cost of transporting fuel to remoter locations such as in the Highlands of Scotland or rural England.

But in other cases market forces were responsible with experts saying if retailers can get away with charging a higher price, they will and motorists were being urged to shop around.
