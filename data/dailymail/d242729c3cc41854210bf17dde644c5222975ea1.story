Brendan Rodgers says Liverpool have more signings to make ahead of their Champions League return.

The Liverpool manager, receiving an honorary degree from the University of Ulster alongside jump jockey AP McCoy, knows he must strengthen his squad before the new season starts.

And Rodgers promised just that, offering fans at Anfield a glimmer of good news in the midst of the Luis Suarez debacle.

'We've still got a few more signings to make to ensure we have the squad strength for the Champions League,' he told Sky Sports News.

Rodgers did not comment on Suarez's position with Liverpool after the Uruguay striker bit Italy's Giorgio Chiellini on the shoulder in the World Cup.

Neither did the 41-year-old indicate where he stands on the issue that has dominated newspapers.

AP McCoy, who won more races than any jump jockey in history and has more than 4,000 triumphs to his name, was hailed for his 'outstanding contribution to sport' at the ceremony.

He received an honorary Doctor of Science - the same as Rodgers.
