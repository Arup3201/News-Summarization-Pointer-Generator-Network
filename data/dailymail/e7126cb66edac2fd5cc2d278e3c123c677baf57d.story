The dramatic moment a policeman shoots dead a man’s beloved pet dog while responding to an emergency call at the wrong address has been released on the internet.

Footage from the patrol car’s dashboard camera captures the shot ring out milliseconds after the officer shouts: ‘Show me your hands, show me your hands. Get your dog.’

Owner Michael Paxton, 40, can be heard crying out: ‘Don't shoot my dog. What are you doing, what did you shoot my dog for? What are you doing? I live here.'

Shocked: Footage from the police patrol car captures the sound of Michael Paxton's dog Cisco being shot dead

‘I didn't know you were here I was just taking him into the yard. Oh my god, I can't believe you just shot my dog.

'I need to give him to the vet. What 
are you doing here?,’ adding ‘thanks for shooting my best friend’, you 
killed my best friend'.

He then says: 'Thanks for pulling a gun on me in my own driveway 
for no reason.'

He says he was playing Frisbee with 
his seven-year-old Australian cattle dog, Cisco, at his home in Austin, 
Texas, when a police officer suddenly appeared, drew his weapon and 
ordered him to put his hands up.

It is understood the police were responding to a domestic abuse call of a man 
choking a woman and had unknowingly arrived at Paxton's home after the 
911 caller gave the wrong address.

Mr Paxton has launched a Facebook 
campaign called “Justice for Cisco” in to put pressure on Austin police 
over dog shooting’.

On the recording uploaded to YouTube, 
the police officer can be heard explaining his version of events moments after the shooting to a 
colleague at the scene.

He said: ‘I came round the corner. He [Paxton] walks from behind that tree, I tell him to show me his hands. Dog comes 
flying out of nowhere, dude, comes straight up at me, jumps at me and I 
popped it.’

The officer asks several times 'do you have a girlfriend?' before telling Mr Paxton the dog should have been on a leash.

Campaign: The Facebook page named Justice For Cisco, which was created yesterday, has had more than 26,000 likes and hundreds of messages of support, outrage and anger

The footage from the police car does not capture footage of the actual events, only the audio.

But since being uploaded yesterday, it has been viewed more than 16,000 times.

Mr Paxton yesterday described the moment he was confronted in his front yard by an officer with his gun drawn.

He said:
 ‘He had a Taser. He had pepper spray. I don't understand why, in broad 
daylight, he pulled a gun on me. I wasn't running. I wasn't hiding,’ 
Paxton told ABCNews.com. ‘I was just saying, "I live here." I was panicking. I was afraid for my life.’

'While I was at gunpoint, my dog came
 from my backyard barking at the officer,' Paxton wrote on the Facebook 
page dedicated to Cisco’s cause.

'I
 yelled for the officer to not shoot my dog, that he will not bite, but 
the officer immediately shot and killed my dog right in front of me.'

The
 Facebook page named Justice For Cisco, which was created yesterday, has
 had more than 26,000 likes and hundreds of messages of support, outrage
 and anger.

One person named Todd Hariaczyi said: 'I cannot begin to imagine your loss. I have had dogs my entire life, and I cannot fathom losing one in such a horrible manner.

'I am disgusted by the officer's actions--shoot now, ask later--and his attempt to blame you for the entire ordeal. It's your property! Of course, your dog is on it. I will refrain from expressing how I feel about him because it's nothing I can repeat here. I hope you get the justice you deserve.'

Another, named Nick Pound, added: 'The officer needs to not only be fired, but charged like any other person who would shoot and kill an animal. Felony animal cruelty in most states carries up to 5 years in prison.'

Paxton said Cisco was harmless and had never bitten or attacked anybody before. 'The only thing that has brought me comfort is the response and outpouring of emotion for him,' he told ABCNews.com.

Shooter: The Austin Police Department said the officer, pictured, had felt threatened after the dog came at him and barked

'I'm sure he heard the yelling. He's a dog. This is his territory. He's going to be territorial to some extent. To me, it's pretty typical dog behavior. He's not a viscious dog. He was a good boy. He was a real good boy.'

The Austin Police Department said the officer felt threatened after the dog charged at him and barked, leaving him with no alternative.

'Officers have to do everything they can to protect themselves, up to and including the use of deadly force,' Austin Police Cpl. Anthony Hipolito told ABCNews. com

'It's something that we don't ever want to do. To shoot and kill an animal is very unfortunate and tragic. The officer is distraught and did not want to do it, but at the same time, he had to protect himself.'

Paxton’s neighbors Jesus Rivera and Maria Hernandez told the Digital Texan that they had been fighting and were the ones that the police officer meant to visit.
