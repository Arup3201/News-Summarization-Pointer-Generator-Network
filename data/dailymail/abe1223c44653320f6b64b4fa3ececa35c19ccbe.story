Tum-thing to tell us? Sources have claimed that Jessica Biel - pictured with what appears to be a baby bump in October - and Justin Timberlake are preparing to welcome their first child into the world 

The actress sparked rumours that she is pregnant after stepping out in late October revealing what appeared to be a baby bump.

The 32-year-old actress was pictured on October 22 as she went shopping with a pal at the American Party Store on Vine in West Hollywood.

Making sure not to do any heavy lifting, Jessica's business partner and stylist Estee Stanley instead carried a huge disco mirror ball for the star as they left the store together. 

Wearing a pair of tight-fitting jeans and a chunky knitted scarf, Jessica's unbuttoned shirt revealed a mystery bump as she headed home.

MailOnline has reached out to a representative for the actress who has so far been unavailable for comment.

Expecting? Speculation grew when the brunette beauty was pictured out in Los Angeles in October with her unbuttoned shirt seeming to reveal a small pregnancy bump

Speculation grew even more when the brunette beauty and her husband were pictured enjoying a hike in the foothills above Los Angeles on October 24.

Jessica was comfortably clad in stretchy black leggings and a loose-fitting black tank top that spilled over what appeared to be a baby bump. 

In August it was claimed that the couple have been trying for a baby as a source said: 'They've been trying to conceive for a couple of months now, and she told Justin she's going to see a fertility expert.

'She has no problem using technology, if that's what it will take to have a baby and stick this marriage out.'

Justin fuelled pregnancy rumours last week when the 33-year-old singer attended the amfAR Gala in Los Angeles without the brunette beauty.

What's more, Jessica's friend Ariel Foxman sparked further speculation his pal is expecting when the InStyle editor posted a Throwback Thursday picture on Instagram last week congratulating the star on her pregnancy.

He tweeted: 'Congrats @jessicabiel on your impending motherhood… Looking forward to the red carpet maternity style pic to come #tbt. (sic)'. 

Jessica and Justin, 33, have certainly been open about their plans to start a family together.  

Motherhood on her mind: Late last year the actress confirmed they would be having children 'at some point' after getting broody on the set of her movie The Truth About Emanuel

Late last year the actress confirmed they would be having children 'at some point' after getting broody on the set of her movie The Truth About Emanuel. 

Talking to E! about the role and getting the maternal instinct, she said: 'I think to make this person, this character, work without being some ridiculous, crazy performance, is to really believe in what she's doing and believe that that is her truth, that baby is her baby and that's what it is

'And so the nurturing element of being a mother, that is really what I tapped into. Because it's like, the best villain really believes what they're doing. It's the same idea. This woman, that's just her truth, her reality.'

Well it's big, and it's round: There was no doubt that Jessica had purchased a huge mirrorball

Something to celebrate? Jessica was seen leaving The American Party Store on Vine, in West Hollywood

When asked about when she would be starting a family, she said: 'I don't know. I'm not quite sure about sooner or later, but definitely at some point.'

Meanwhile in 2013, Justin said of starting a family: 'I'm not against the idea at all, but I think I still have some time ahead of me. Let's leave it to fate.'

He added to OK! Magazine: 'Life didn't change overnight. Marriage, family - it's all part of the normal steps you take when you reach your thirties.

Ready for fatherhood? Last month, Justin posed with this koala named April at a zoo in Australia 

'She's brought me stability and an inner force. The most important thing for me is that we're able to communicate so well and talk about absolutely everything.

'It's beautiful to have that kind of closeness and understanding.'

Justin has recently been taking his The 20/20 Experience World Tour to Australia and New Zealand.

The singer will play his final date of the tour in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.

Justin and Jessica started dating in 2007 before getting engaged in December 2011 - five months after a brief split. They married in Italy in a lavish ceremony in October 2012.
