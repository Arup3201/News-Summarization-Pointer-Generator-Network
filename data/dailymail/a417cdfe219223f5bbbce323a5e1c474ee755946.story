U.S. President Obama reportedly 'made threats and demanded talks' with Iran

The White House has denied calling for direct talks with Iran in a 'secret letter' to the country's supreme leader.

A conservative Iranian lawmaker had claimed that Barack Obama was trying to open back-channel negotiations with the leadership of the Islamic Republic.

But yesterday a White House official said that Mr Obama had not sent a letter to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

He added that the U.S. government was continuing to use other diplomatic channels to dissuade Iran from shutting down the strategic Strait of Hormuz.

Iran has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, the crucial route connecting the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman, where about one-sixth of the global oil flows through, because of new U.S. sanctions over its nuclear program.

Iran's Revolutionary Guard, the country's most powerful military force, says Tehran's leadership has decided to order the closure of the oil route if Iran's oil exports are blocked.

U.S. military officials have made it clear that the country is preparing itself for a possible naval clash if the route is blocked.

Today conservative lawmaker Ali Motahari claimed to know the content of a letter from Mr Obama to the Ayatollah, days after the administration said it was warning Iran through public and private channels against any action that threatens the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf.

'In the letter, Obama called for direct talks with Iran,' Fars news agency reported.

'The letter also said that closing the Strait of Hormuz is (Washington's) red line.'

'The first part of the letter contains threats and the second part contains an offer for dialogue,' he added.

Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Ramin Mehmanparast confirmed that Tehran had received the letter and was 
considering a possible response.

A senior Guard officer said earlier this month that the decision to block the route has been made by Iran's top authorities.

Iranian politicians have made the 
threat in the past, but this was the strongest statement yet that a 
closure of the strait is official policy.

As the West made the military threat against Iran, Russia refused to back it, warning that it would trigger a 'chain reaction' that could destabilise the world.

Foreign minister  Sergey Lavrov insisted that his country was 'seriously worried' about the sanctions against Tehran over its disputed nuclear program.

And he also warned that stifling the country's economy could hurt the Iranian people.

Lavrov said: 'The consequences will be extremely 
grave," he said. "It's not going to be an easy walk. It will trigger a 
chain reaction and I don't know where it will stop.'

The threat of more sanctions as well as the possibility of military action against Iran are linked to concerns about its uranium enrichment program.

The U.S. and its Western allies suspect it is aimed at developing nuclear weapons. Iran insists its efforts are designed for civilian power generation and research.

Israel considers a nuclear-armed Iran a threat to its survival and has hinted it could take military action if sanctions fail to stop Iran's nuclear bid.

The U.S. considers a military strike
on Iran's known nuclear facilities undesirable because it could have 
unintended consequences and would likely only stall, not end, Tehran's 
nuclear drive.

Washington worries that Iran's recent claim that it is expanding nuclear operations might prod Israel closer to a strike.

Russia has long walked a fine line on 
the Iranian nuclear crisis, mixing careful criticism of Iran, an 
important trading partner, with praise for some of its moves and calls 
for more talks.

Although Moscow, which built Iran's first nuclear power plant, has backed some of the previous U.N. sanctions against Iran, it has in recent months firmly rejected new ones.

In a press conference, Lavrov predicted that a military attack on Iran would send refugees streaming into its Caspian Sea neighbor Azerbaijan and further on to Russia, and said it could also 'add fuel to the smoldering confrontation between Sunnis and Shiites.'

The Sunni Arab states in the Gulf like Saudi Arabia are close U.S. allies, locked in decades-old rivalries with Iran's Shiite-led Islamic Republic.

The U.S. already has imposed new sanctions targeting Iran's central bank and, by extension, refiners' ability to buy and pay for crude.

The EU is weighing whether to impose sanctions on buying Iranian oil, which is the source of more than 80 percent of Tehran's foreign revenue.

On Wednesday, Spanish Foreign Minister 
Jose Manuel Garcia-Margall said his nation will back a possible EU oil 
embargo against Iran that would start July 1 even though it would 
inflict 'huge damage' on its two major oil importers.

Talks: Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi, left, is hoping for resolution having arrived in Istanbul for negotiations

Cash-strapped Greece has indicated it wants to stall any action because it is an importer of Iranian oil and gets the best payment terms from Tehran.

EU ambassadors will address the issue Thursday ahead of next Monday's meeting of EU foreign ministers.

Lavrov, however, said sanctions on Iranian oil exports have 'nothing to do with a desire to strengthen the nuclear nonproliferation.'

'It's aimed at stifling the Iranian economy and the population in an apparent hope to provoke discontent,' the Russian foreign minister said.

Russia believes that 'all conceivable sanctions already have been applied' and that new penalties could derail hopes for continuing six-way negotiations on the Iranian nuclear program, provoking Iranian intransigence, Lavrov said.

He noted that the EU's consideration of new sanctions comes as Iran plans to host a delegation from the U.N. nuclear watchdog.

'We believe that there is every chance to resume talks between the six powers and Iran, and we are concerned about obstacles being put to them.

'The sanctions could hardly help make the talks productive,' he said.

Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi said upon arrival in the Turkish capital that Istanbul is the likely venue for further talks with world powers on his country's nuclear program.

He did not give a date for the negotiations, but said Turkey is in touch with Iranian and EU officials.

Meanwhile, Iran's official IRNA news agency said a senior security official, Ali Bagheri, headed to Moscow for talks with Lavrov and other Russian officials
