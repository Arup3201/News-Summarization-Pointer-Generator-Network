Home hunters spend less time deciding to buy a property than they do watching one episode of Coronation Street, a new study reveals.

Research released today indicates we spend just 25 minutes and 30 seconds viewing a property before making a decision.

This is almost five minutes less than it takes to watch one episode of the popular soap, including the advertisements.

A lovely looking living room but almost three in ten homeowners (28 per cent) would be quick to buy the house it is in because they 'did not want to put off the vendor by spending too much time there'

And this hasty decision could prove to be costly with the average UK home selling for £250,000 - meaning each minute we decide to part with £9,804.

What's more, some of us are so eager to get the keys to a new home that we buy it before even seeing it for real, the study found.

The new research, carried out by Barratt Homes, quizzed 2,000 Britons about how long it takes us to decide whether to buy a home or not.

More than a quarter (27 per cent) of potential buyers felt 'pressure' from estate agents and 25 per cent were not sure how to arrange a second viewing

It found one in eight (13 per cent) purchased a property without even seeing it.

Meanwhile, one in five house hunters (17 per cent) decided to buy within ten minutes or less.

The study suggests we spend just seven and a half minutes more deciding on a new home than we do on a new pair of jeans.

And it seems we allocate more time choosing which car to buy as it takes us 31 minutes to make that decision.

The research comes as Barratt Homes released a new 21st Century Living: Heads, Hearts and Homes Report.

It reveals the reasons why we are so quick to purchase a new property.

Almost three in ten homeowners (28 per cent) were quick to buy because they 'did not want to put off the vendor by spending too much time there'.

Home hunters spend less time deciding to buy a property than they do watching one episode of Coronation Street - with the adverts - (above), a new study reveals.

More than a quarter (27 per cent) felt 'pressure' from estate agents and 25 per cent were not sure how to arrange a second viewing.

One in ten (10 per cent) said they had a 'lack of time' and wanted to purchase the home there and then.

The process leaves people feeling 'stressed' (five per cent) and 'worried' (four per cent).

Mark Clare, the CEO of Barratt Developments, said: 'Purchasing a property, whether for the first time or the tenth time, is a major life investment.

'It is really important for the buyer to be 100 per cent happy and confident in their decision.

'But rushing this decision can and should be avoided.

'Considering a new build home is one way to do this - new build homes offer customers the opportunity to view a new property they're interested in as many times as they like, without feeling pressured or rushed.'

Barratt Homes teamed up with the Social Issues Research Centre to gain further insight into the emotional factors affecting property buying.

Kate Fox, the author of Watching the English: The Hidden Rules of English Behaviour, said: 'Given the deep emotional importance of the house in society, there is something very interesting about the disproportionately short amount of time - if any at all - that prospective buyers spend in a house before making the decision to buy.

'When we enter a person's home with the intention of buying it, it can seem strange and uncomfortable - like an imposition or invasion of privacy.'

Even if you've spent less than half an hour picking out your home, make sure you put in the time and research to secure the best mortgage for you - don't just take the first one you see.

There are hundreds, if not thousands, of options out there, so, as well as doing your own research, this is an occasion to search out expert opinion from a good mortgage broker. 

First, read Mail Online's award-winning money section This is Money's regularly updated What next for mortgage rates? This outlines the current state of the market and highlights the current best buy deals.

Then also check the top mortgage deals on offer currently in our best buy mortgage tables, or click through by using our helpful table (right).

You should now be armed with some knowledge about what is on offer and you can use our True cost mortgage calculator to compare how different deals stack up.

You should also talk to a mortgage broker. There is no obligation to go through with their recommendation and so they may not end up actually arranging the mortgage for you, but they will be able to explain your options and help you to find the best deal.

Go a broker who offers advice from the whole market. Avoid brokers who offer a restricted service based on products from a limited number of lenders, and don't just simply go to your bank - unless you get lucky, you will be unlikely to find the best deal this way

This is Money has a carefully chosen partnership with mortgage broker London and Country. We have picked them because they offer a good service, with no upfront fees. Find about more about London & Country's fee free mortgage advice here.
