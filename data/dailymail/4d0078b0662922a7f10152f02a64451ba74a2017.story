She may have the face of a porcelain doll but below the neck this 18-year-old  is more like The Incredible Hulk and can deadlift 400lb - the average weight of a male lion.

Powerlifter Julia Vins' unusual blend of wide-eyed beauty and muscular physique has captured the attention of fans in her native Russia - attracting more than 23,000 Instagram followers.

The innocent-faced teenager - who likes to take topless pictures of herself - already holds three world powerlifting records but says there's no limit to how muscly she would like to become.

The innocent-faced powerlifter has scored thousands of fans in her native Russia for her unusual blend of wide-eyed pretty looks and muscular physique

Ms Vins, who was born in the city of Engels, says: 'People know me as "muscle Barbie" - I like this comparison. It's nice.

'I have these big, beautiful eyes and wear make-up. But at the same time, I'm strong.

'I can deadlift 180kg in training. I want to become as big as possible.'

Ms Vins claims her astonishing appearance divides the opposite sex.

'Everyone has an opinion on what I look like - they either respect my work or reprimand me for being a muscly girl,' she said.

'But to be honest, I've noticed that the guys who are negative about my athleticism - are just jealous.'

The powerlifter eats five to six small meals per day, which consist of chicken, eggs, cheese, rice and vegetables. But she allows herself one cheat day per week

Since childhood, Ms Vins' angelic face meant she's always been compared to a pretty doll. But the naturally slender girl never felt like she had any purpose in life.

'Because of my facial features, people have always said I look like a doll,' she said.

'And I was a good, academic girl for so many years. I studied music, was well-read, participated in various school competitions and was skilled at art.

'But I never felt like I had any particular objective in life. My body was not in harmony with my soul - it wasn't the right one for me.'

In an attempt to find some meaning in her life, Julia began going to the gym at age 15.

She explains: 'I had no interest in sport but I was lost. I thought I might see if I could build some strength and confidence by weight training at the gym.

'I started copying exercises that the male gym-goers did. It did not make me strong but then I started powerlifting.

'I loved it! I knew then that my goal was - to build muscle.'

A year later, Ms Vins met a coach who saw potential in her as a weightlifter. She started training at the gym with him for three to five hours, four times per week.

Ms Vins also transformed her diet. She now eats five to six small meals per day, which consist of chicken, eggs, cheese, rice and vegetables. But she allows herself one cheat day per week.

Finally in August 2014, Ms Vins entered the World Powerlifting Championships in Moscow and won the competition. She achieved three world records in the sum 440kg - these were 180kg (396lb) in the squat, 105kg (230lb) in bench press and 165kg (364lb) in the deadlift.

Ms Vins feels it is important to look sexy even when she's pumping iron.

'I always wear make-up, even when I'm squatting. I think it's important to look attractive in any situation.

'I make sure my hair is done up in cute plaits and ribbons.

'I like fashion too but it's very difficult to find nice clothes as my size is not standard.

Ms Vins says her parents prefer not to get involved with her career. But her older 29-year-old boyfriend, Sergei, likes to weightlift with her.

'My mum and dad don't like to interfere with my life but Sergei is very hands-on.

'For me, there is no limit. I want to become as muscly as possible.

'Many people have tried to knock me down but my training has made me strong - both physically and mentally.

'I'm no ordinary doll. I hope everyone finds their true calling in life like I did.

'I don't like to think of what I would have become if I wasn't muscle Barbie.'
