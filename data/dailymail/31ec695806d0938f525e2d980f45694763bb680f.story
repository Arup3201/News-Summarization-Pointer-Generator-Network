A pianist has been left horrified after finding a dead earwig lurking in his Marks & Spencer wholefood salad.

Lee Reed, 36, said he felt 'physically sick' after nearly swallowing the insect, which he discovered in the pre-prepared salad he bought from the M4 service station near Reading, Berkshire.

The wedding musician, from Watford, Hertfordshire, has now hit out at Marks & Spencer after the store handed him a £15 gift voucher for the 'isolated incident'.

Wedding pianist Lee Reed, 36, said he felt 'physically sick' after finding a 'massive' earwig in his nutty super wholefood salad, which he bought from Marks & Spencer at the M4 service station near Reading, Berkshire

'It's basically a fob-off,' he said.

'I don't want to be one of those greedy compensation claimants but I feel the way I have been shrugged off is not fair.

'It was horrible. I couldn't eat anything for the rest of that day.'

Mr Reed said he regularly bought the store's nutty super wholefood salad and picked up the offending one as he made his way to a wedding gig in Reading. The salads are priced at two for £3.50.

However, he said he wouldn't be purchasing any food from the high street chain again.

He said 'I wouldn't buy anything from there again, absolutely not, because you just don't know anymore.

'Just the thought of it put me right off my food - it was right at the bottom so I'd had a few mouthfuls.

'I was just about to put it in my mouth when I saw it was there.

'It was just disgusting. It's not nice to have something like that in there.

'If it was a little fly you might not notice but it was a massive earwig.'

Marks & Spencer apologised and handed Mr Reed a £15 gift voucher for the 'isolated incident' (file picture)

Mr Reed discovered the critter in his greens in June and reported it to the store who launched an investigation.

This week, West Berkshire and Wokingham Environmental Health ruled it was an 'isolated incident'.

Marks & Spencer spokesman Sarah Wynne said all salads are thoroughly washed and inspected to make sure all insects have been removed.

She added: 'Quality is extremely important to us, we take the health of our customers seriously and have agreed with our growers to minimise the use of pesticides.'
