After Sydney Leathers' accusations of Anthony Weiner's 'business relationship' marriage, wife Huma Abedin's mom has showed up at the reeling political wife's New York City home to support her daughter.

Leathers, the 23-year-old who revealed the latest string of explicit sex messages and naked pictures from Anthony Weiner, gave her first interview with CBS's Inside Edition and cried for Abedin 'for the pain she probably feels.'

Now, as the other woman rubs salt in Abedin's wounds by telling the world her marriage is just 'an arrangement,' Saleha Mahmood Abedin has showed up in Manhattan to comfort her reeling politico daughter.

Support: Saleha Manmood Abedin, Huma Abedin's mom, arrived to her daughter's Manhattan home Saturday in the midst of what is no doubt a difficult time

Scrutiny: Saleha Mahmood Abedin's support for her daughter comes at a time when the world is watching and as Huma's decision to stay with Anthony Weiner after a second high profile sex scandal comes into questions

On the fence? Though Abedin stood by her husband as he admitted he continued his online relationships after leaving congress, it has been rumored she considered leaving him at the time

Stepping out: Sydney Leathers, the woman who exposed the latest explicit messages from Anthony Weiner, was seen in Los Angeles, California on Thursday as she picked up a coffee

Leathers
first contacted Weiner in her role as a political blogger, right after 
the texting scandal, to lambast him for his actions.

He
never responded to the message, and it wasn't until a year later that 
they finally contacted, 'poking' each other on a social networking site.

From there, their relationship turned dirty, escalating to phone sex sessions twice a week from June to November 2012.

Scandal: Leathers and Weiner started a relationship after Weiner resigned from Congress in June 2011

Eye-catching: Leathers, a political blogger based in Indiana, chatted on the phone as she grabbed a Starbucks

Leathers called the affair 'dark and dirty' and that new-father Weiner was using their online trysts as a way of 'acting out.'

But
she also said that they truly loved each other, and that Weiner even 
offered to buy the Indiana-based Leathers an apartment in Chicago so they could spend time together when he was in town. 

'I've found the perfect woman. Gorgeous, sexy and like a bit crazy,' Weiner wrote in one exchange.

'I think it was a fantasy thing for both of us,' she said.

He even got jealous of her other online relationships.

'Me
being hit on by other men really upset him,' she said. 'We were 
Facebook friends, so he could see if men were commenting on photos of 
me, or telling me that I was pretty.

'Really minor things like that really bothered him.'

Their
relationship took a turn for the worse in the lead up to the New York 
City mayoral race, when Weiner contacted Leathers and asked her delete 
their conversations.

'Do me a solid,' he texted her four months ago. '“Can you hard delete all our chats here.”

'Obviously
I knew that he wanted me to erase any evidence of out conversations,' 
Leathers said. 'Because that was around the time I knew that he was 
going to run for mayor.

For Leathers, things turned scary when a man claiming to be Weiner's 'brother' contacted he 'to see if she was 
going to be a problem.'

Standing out: She seemed unfazed by the political firestorm she sparked with her revelations earlier this week

Spotted: Apart from an interview with Inside Edition, it is the first time that Leathers has been spotted out

Weiner's
brother Jason denies any contact with Leathers, but a Facebook message 
from Weiner to Leathers asks her if they're 'ok' after a conversation 
with his brother.

'My 
brother e-mailed me asking about you and whether I pissed you off. he 
told me to look at your feed, but nothing seems about me. maybe he was 
just tallying up pro and con comments and took one of your pithy posts 
as being something bad about me,' Weiner wrote.

In
the interview, Leathers said she had initially been attracted to Weiner
because of his politics, but had since seen another side to him.

Affair: She first contacted Weiner to criticize him for his indiscretions before they also shared explicit messages

Revelations: Sydney released the explicit messages and photos she received from Weiner on Tuesday

Taking a break: She is seen heading to her car after stopping for a Starbucks in Los Angeles on Thursday

'He's not who I thought he was,' she said.

When asked what she would like to say to him now, she responded: 'Stop lying, stop embarrassing his wife, and get help.'

Leathers was spotted out on Thursday for the first time since disclosing the mayoral candidates indiscretions. She wore an an eye-catching blue dress and towering wedge heels as she grabbed coffee in Los Angeles on Thursday.

Laughing as she chatted on the phone and visited Starbucks, she seemed unfazed by the political storm created by her revelations of her six-month virtual affair with the married politician.

Regrets? Leathers apologized for the hurt she had cause Weiner's wife by engaging in the online affair

The Inside Edition
interview came as her high school friends described her as someone who 
was always desperate for fame just as it emerged she had got herself an 
agent and was hoping to make $100,000 by selling her story.

Leathers hoped Weiner would be her ticket out of 'Conservative Hell' Indiana and alleges he promised to put her up in a condo in Chicago and a possible job at Politico, they said.

She lives with her machinist father in Princeton and had a difficult relationship with her thrice-married mother since they split six years ago.

Her mother Laura only learned about her daughter's involvement with Weiner when the story broke nationally and are said to be still trying to absorb the shock, her uncle, Mt Carmel Police Chief Jon Lockhart, told MailOnline.

'Sydney and her mom don't talk much and I haven't seen her much really since the divorce. The first we knew anything about it was along with everyone else,' he said.

Speaking out: In an interview with Inside Edition, Leathers said she is now disgusted by Weiner

Since the revelations, Weiner has 
admitted that he started three different virtual relationships with 
women after he resigned from Congress following his Twitter sexting 
scandal in 2011. 

And earlier this week, the disgraced 
congressman and his wife Huma Abedin held a joint press conference 
declaring their dedication to both one another and the campaign.

Afterwards,
Weiner sent an email to supporters saying that the bid for New York 
City's mayor was 'too important' to give up over 'embarrassing personal 
things'.

Rivals,
newspaper editorial pages and former New York congressional colleagues 
urged the Democrat to quit after he acknowledged exchanging raunchy 
messages and photos online after he had resigned from Congress for 
similar behaviour.

Criticized: Many colleagues, rivals and editorial pages have called for Weiner to drop out of the mayoral race

Jerrold Nadler, Democratic representative for New York's 10th congressional district, said: 'I think he should pull out of the race. I think he needs serious psychiatric help.'

Nydia Velázquez, who was also Weiner's colleague back when he was a Democratic representative for the city, said his antics were a 'total distraction' from the real issues the mayoral campaign should be debating.

Weiner's strongest rivals in the polls, Christine Quinn and Bill Thompson, criticised him but didn't directly call on him to quit.
