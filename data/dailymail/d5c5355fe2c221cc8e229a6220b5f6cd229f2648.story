Jimmy Anderson declared himself satisfied with the perfect comeback after playing an integral part in the demolition of India that England hope will kick-start their World Cup challenge.

'It couldn't have gone much better really,' said Anderson after taking four wickets in the thumping Tri-series win at the Gabba.

'I was just happy to get out there, get a competitive game under my belt and come through it unscathed.

'I was delighted to be back in the team and with the wickets, that was a bonus. It's just one game, my first game back and it went really well but I've still got a lot of work to do. 

'Not just myself, but as a team too. We want to build on what was such a good performance and hopefully we can do that on Friday.'

Anderson missed the one-day tour of Sri Lanka before Christmas with a knee injury and found his body protesting when he made his comeback in England's first warm-up game of this World Cup tour. It forced him to miss the opening defeat by Australia in Sydney.

'The knee has been fine,' he insisted. 'I've not had any issues with that for a while now. It's just everything else that seems to stiffen up and niggles crop up. 

'I feel strong at the minute and just to get through yesterday was really good for me. To spend 40-odd overs in the field was progress and hopefully I can get through a full 50 on Friday.'

The biggest plus of England's nine-wicket win against the defending World Cup champions was the man-of-the-match display from Steven Finn, who took five wickets in a city he was sent home from this time last year when he was deemed 'unselectable' for the Ashes tour.

Anderson, who took a while on the periphery before he became England's attack leader, can empathise after his early travails in an England shirt.

'There definitely are similarities,' said Anderson. 'I've chatted to him about it quite a bit. We've worked together a reasonable amount on this tour so far. 

'He's worked so hard off the field, trying to get himself back to the form we know he can produce. Everyone was delighted for him yesterday, it was a fantastic performance from him.

'Saying that he's a very humble, honest guy and he knows it's just one performance and he's got a lot of hard work to do to keep improving on that.'

But England were delighted with a victory they badly needed at this early stage of a tour where they have been dismissed as World Cup no-hopers. Now they are preparing to meet Australia on Friday here at the Bellerive Oval.

'It's huge for us,' said Anderson. 'We're still developing as a team. There's a lot of belief in the dressing room. We know we've got a huge amount of talent and the ability to upset teams like we did yesterday, beating the best in the world.

'Yesterday was a great performance but it's one game and we know we've got a lot of hard work and improving to do. That starts tomorrow and hopefully we can continue the good work on Friday.'

Australia will be without David Warner in Hobart but they insist he is being rested with a sore hamstring rather than being disciplined for the latest of the many spats that have punctuated his career. 

Warner's clash with Rohit Sharma of India in Melbourne sparked a huge debate about player behaviour in cricket. Anderson, as England's chief sledger, is well qualified to speak on the subject.

'Of course there's a line and I think all players are aware of that,' said England's leading international wicket-taker.

'I don't think at the moment there is any more sledging than there's been in the history of cricket, it's something that's gone on for years and years. There's a spotlight on it a little bit more - stump mics and lots of cameras on the ground.

'I think guys have got to use their heads a little bit and be a bit smart about what is said on the field, if anything is said at all.

'You don't want to take away the aggression from teams, I think we showed yesterday we were really aggressive with the ball all the way through and there was very little said at all.

'I don't think it should disappear from the game, I think it's quite entertaining when it's done in the right manner.'
