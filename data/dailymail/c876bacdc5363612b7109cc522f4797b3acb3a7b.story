Bearing gifts of extra rations, Coca Cola and nylon stockings it is no wonder that American GIs were popular house guests among British families during the Second World War.

With British soldiers away in Europe, war-hit families were issued with an urgent plea to invite their US colleagues to share their Christmas celebrations.

Faced with the prospect of their guests bringing extra food with them, families jumped at the chance to welcome the Americans into their homes, with some 50 invitations being offered for every GI, or Government Issue.

For troops serving in a foreign land, far away from home, Christmas was a difficult time.

Around 60,000 had reached Britain by December, with the majority being stationed in East Anglia, where they had been tasked with building airfields for American planes.

As many soldiers and airmen as possible were given the day off, and advised to spend the day with British families, 'Filling the chairs left empty by British fighting men'.

Posters were put up around bases bearing the message: 'GIs spend your Christmas at home with a British family'.

The soldiers who took up the invitations were given special ration packs to share with their guests, containing sought-after items such as fruit juice, evaporated milk, bacon, coffee sugar, rice, peas and lard.

War and rationing had brought many changes to familiar festive rituals in Britain, and Christmas celebrations often had to be scaled down or adjusted as restrictions and shortages took hold.

As even the most basic foods were scarce, festive luxuries were hard to come by.

Gifts were often homemade and practical and childrenâ€™s toys often made from recycled materials.

With the extra food on offer, perhaps it was not a surprise when so many invitations were extended that in 1942 a US camp commander revealed 'The ration is estimated at 50 invitations for every one soldier available.'

He urged more GIs about to spend their first Christmas in Britain to come forward 'and accept some more of those invitations'.

One GI recalled in historian Juliet Gardiner's book Overpaid, Oversexed, And Over Here: The American GI In World War II Britain, how he was invited to spend Christmas at the home of a woman in the Land Army.

He had arrived on a bicycle, laden down with his rations of spam, powdered coffee, chocolate and soap, along with other items from his camp stores.

'We all sat down to a Christmas dinner and scene that might have made Charles Dickens the only true recorder', he said.

'I donâ€™t recall what we had for dinner, but at long last the plum pudding was served â€“ and I gained the silver sixpence.'

Along with their rations the GIs were also responsible for bringing many festive traditions into British homes, including Christmas crackers, while in exchange the Brits introduced their guests to Advent calenders and Advent candles.

As in peacetime, a prominent feature of a war-time Christmas was singing songs and carols, and from 1939 onwards the BBC's special Christmas Day radio programming would include a speech by the King, an event which became an annual ritual and continues to this day.

The Americans would also help British families to forget their wartime woes by throwing lavish parties at their Army and Air bases, inviting local school children to join in their festivities.

War orphans were the guests of honour when the US Army soldiers of the 3120th Signal Service Battalion held a party for the children at the Salvation Army War Emergency Home at Lady Templemore's estate at Alresford, Gloucestershire.

Party time: For many young children away from home Christmas was a difficult time, especially for these evacuees who were cheered up by a visit from Father Christmas

For these young children Christmas could be a particularly difficult time, as they were not only spending the holidays away from home, but they had also lost a parent - either in action, or as a result of enemy bombing raids.

One former guest of a party in Middlesbrough recalled how a Christmas party was thrown for school children in the Town Hall and the youngsters each given a gift from Santa - who had an American accent.

'The G.I.s had decorated the interior with lots of flags, Stars and Stripes and Union Jacks, together with tinsel and paper chains,' he said.

'They served an immense amount of food, not only the cakes, jellies and blancmange but many sweet dishes that we hadn't seen for ages due to rationing.'

Keen to decorate their vast bases, the GIs would hang 'chaff', strips of metallic foil thrown from their aircraft to confuse German radar, from trees, as well as more traditional items like coloured lights and streamers.

Lasting legacy: GI brides and their babies get ready to fly to America for Christmas 1946. Unfortunately, their flight was turned back because of bad weather. These women and their children had to wait for another opportunity to reach their new home.

When the GIs arrived on British shores in 1942, bringing with them sought-after Coca Cola, cigarettes, chewing gum and nylons there was initially distrust between the Brits and the GIs.

Their average salaries were more than five times that paid to British soldiers and their generosity made them particularly attractive to women.

Around 70,000 British women became GI brides, although it was estimated that around 9,000 war babies were born out of wedlock as a result of the GIs liaisons.

After the war the British GI wives were offered a free passage by the US Army to start their new lives in America, although the journey was not so simple for the group of women preparing to fly across the Atlantic for Christmas 1946.

Four years after the first GIs found themselves far from home in the UK, the British women found themselves in the same predicament as their flight was turned back because of bad weather, and they had to wait for another opportunity to reach their new home.

By the time the war was over around three million US soldiers had spent time in Britain, and were frequently described as being 'overpaid, oversexed and over here'.
