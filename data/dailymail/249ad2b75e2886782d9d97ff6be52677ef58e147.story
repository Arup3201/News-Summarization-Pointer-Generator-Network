Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert has said Southampton counterpart Ronald Koeman has behaved in an unacceptable manner by trying to unsettle his Dutch World Cup semi-final defender Ron Vlaar.

Vlaar came through his first pre-season friendly by playing the second 45 minutes in yesterday’s 0-0 draw with Parma after taking a break after his impressive tournament displays in Brazil.

Lambert is keen to open talks with the 29-year-old centre-half once the transfer window shuts but has been appalled by Koeman saying publicly Vlaar ‘would definitely be an option’ for Southampton after selling Dejan Lovren to Liverpool.

Hot property: Ron Vlaar 'would definitely be an option' for Southampton but Villa want him to stay

Spat: The season hasn't even begun and Paul Lambert is already kicking off with Ronald Koeman

Koeman used to manage Vlaar at Dutch club Feyenoord but Lambert hit out at his comments saying; ‘There is been absolutely no enquiry, not one iota on it. The only thing I am disappointed in is people talking about him, who should know better than to talk about other people’s players.

‘I don’t think you accept it. I think out of respect you don’t do it, you don’t get involved in that. That is my opinion. You will have to ask others what they think but I am just giving my opinion.’

Vlaar’s appearance gave Villa fans a welcome boost and Lambert expects him to be at the club come September 1.

‘He’s only been back in training over a week really. For him to play against Parma was good, he was able to cruise the game so it wasn’t too much of a strain for him.

‘He (Vlaar) had a great World Cup. In the games he had, he was excellent, up against quality players in every one of them. I am expecting Ron to have a good season.’

Vlaar only has a year left on his contract but Lambert hopes formal talks will start soon.

‘Ron has been really good about it, he’s never really pushed anything. Once it settles down, I am pretty sure we will talk.’

Impressive: Vlaar (right) was part of a solid Dutch defence at the World Cup and has attracted interest

Villa need a tight defence this season because on yesterday’s evidence, they lack firepower going into the new campaign.

After recent defeats against Chesterfield and Groningen, a dour draw with Parma was an improvement with the mean Italians marshalled by ex-Liverpool World Cup defender Gabriel Paletta.

Even so, there was little to get Villa fans queuing around the block for season tickets with current sales well down on the 28,000 of last season.

Things only livened up at the end when 18-year-old Jack Grealish came on and started running the show.

It was lay-back for Darren Bent that produced the best chance in injury-time but Bent hit the crossbar from close-range.

‘I will be disappointed if he (Grealish) isn’t pushing for a place this season,’ said Lambert, once a top midfield player himself.
