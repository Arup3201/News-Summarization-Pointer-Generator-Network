Black sacks are overflowing on the streets and communal bins are threatening to become a haven for rats and seagulls.

Mountains of rubbish have been left to rot on the streets of Brighton and Hove after five weeks of dispute between binmen and the country's only Green Party-controlled council.

Furious residents are now threatening to withhold their council tax payments in protest at the weeks of stalemate.

Some residents say that as well as seagulls they have spotted rats and maggots among the waste

The city's communal bins are overflowing with waste and bags of rubbish are spilling on to the ground

They have spoken of maggots breeding in their bins and say the filth has now become so bad it is a health hazard.

Seagulls, a noisy nuisance that Brighton and Hove residents are used to, have now been joined by rats, which are ripping open refuse bags and scattering rubbish across the pavements.

The ugly sight, reminiscent of scenes from the 1970s when rubbish went uncollected in many cities for weeks, has been caused by unofficial action by binmen.

Five weeks of negotiation have so far failed and the local branch of the GMB union is now balloting for industrial action and leaders warn a walkout would cause 'major, major disruption.'

The backlog was created when refuse collectors went on strike on the Wednesday and Thursday after the early May bank holiday weekend.

According to The Argus, residents are now planning to withhold council tax payments until the backlog is cleared.

George Mower, 66, told the newspaper: 'It is disgusting. I saw two rats running around it. It’s a health hazard.

'I’m stopping my council tax as a result. I’m using my car and it’s my labour so why should I pay? Let them take me to court if they want to.'

It is not the first time the city has suffered as piles of rubbish infest their streets.

In 2009, a bin strike brought Brighton and Hove to its knees.

No rubbish was collected from the city's 120,000 households for a week.

The latest dispute comes after town hall bosses announced changes to the way binmen are paid.

For their part, the union claim the changes would leave binmen up to £95 a week out of pocket, whereas others in the department are getting a pay rise under the changes.

The council says the workers who lose money will take an average of £1,000 a year pay cut.

GMB branch secretary Mark Turner told Mail Online: '280 of our members will see between a £35 and £95 a week pay-cut.

'We are very confident on the result 
of the ballot and it would see a significant course of industrial action
and cause major major disruption in the city.

The Green-controlled Brighton and Hove City Council have apologised to residents for the disrupted service

'We are amazed that a green council is doing this. In 2009 they stood on the picket line with us.'

However, the city councillor Jason Kitcat wrote on his blog this month: 'The majority of staff, about 90%, will see little or no change to their total pay, and of those affected more will gain than see detriment. Any detriment will be compensated and we expect the total wage bill to rise slightly.'

A statement on the council's website said: 'We do not know how long the disruption will last and we are sorry, but we cannot provide a normal standard of service.'

It added: 'As a result of the ongoing dispute between employees and the council we are still experiencing targeted disruption to recycling and rubbish collections.

'This means more vehicles than normal are being found to have problems, some crews are not collecting additional waste beside a bin and are working more slowly. No employees are working overtime on recycling and rubbish.'
