Millionaire England footballer Adam Johnson was arrested on suspicion of having underage sex with a 15-year-old girl after she reportedly boasted about their relationship and her father found  out, it has emerged.

The  Sunderland winger was detained at his six-bedroom £1.85m home in County Durham on Monday morning after the schoolgirl's father reportedly complained to police about the alleged liaison.

It is understood the girl bragged about having a 'relationship' with the player, both to friends and on social media, the Daily Telegraph's Martin Evans reports.

The Premier League footballer also reportedly posed for photos with the girl on a number of occasions.

The news emerged as the schoolgirl at the centre of the claims - who has the right to lifelong anonymity - was named online.

The publication of her name prompted Durham Police to issue a reminder that anyone who names the girl will face prosecution.

It comes after the young woman who was raped by footballer Ched Evans was widely named online, forcing her to change her name and move addresses.

After the rumours was reported to police, Johnson was arrested at his mansion and questioned for several hours.

The player, who was signed for £10million in 2012, has since been released on bail. He has also been suspended by Sunderland AFC, pending the outcome of the police investigation.

The Premier League footballer's arrest has come just weeks after his long-term girlfriend Stacey Flounders, 25, gave birth to the couple's first child Ayla Sofia.

It was unclear if Miss Flounders and her daughter, who was born on January 8, were at home at the time of the player's arrest.

But Miss Flounders's mother today defended the former Middlesbrough and Manchester City player, insisting he is '100 per cent innocent'.

Talking about the couple's relationship, she told the Daily Mirror: 'They are still very close and are absolutely still together. He is 100 per cent innocent and we will stand by him.

'He hasn't been found guilty of anything. He is a great lad and has not done anything wrong. This is a horrible situation.'  

The £50,000-a-week player had been due to travel with the rest of the Sunderland squad to East Yorkshire for tonight's league game against Hull City before being suspended. 

A statement from Sunderland said: 'Sunderland AFC has confirmed that Adam Johnson has been suspended from the club, pending the outcome of a police investigation. No further comment will be made at the present time.'

The FA refused to comment on Johnson's arrest.

Johnson, who has represented his country 12 times, gained a reputation as a keen party-goer when he played for Manchester City five years ago.

At the time, he was renting Cristiano Ronaldo's former house near Alderley Edge and would often be seen in the village socialising with fellow players and women. 

But three years ago, after returning to his native North East, Johnson began dating Miss Flounders.

Friends say Johnson opted to live near a quiet hamlet to get away from the 'bright lights' of city life.

Yesterday, three unmarked police cars, a police van, several plain-clothed officers and a forensics team were seen at his house as he was questioned at a Durham police station.

It is unclear where the alleged assault is said to have taken place and police would not release any further details. He has been bailed until March 18.

Johnson was born in Sunderland and raised in Easington, County Durham, before joining Middlesbrough's youth academy as a 12-year-old.

After making his Premier League debut for Middlesbrough in 2005 he was sold in February 2010 to Manchester City. He was signed by Sunderland three years ago.

He failed to make the squad for the World Cup in Brazil last year,

In a statement last night, a Durham Police spokesman said: 'A 27-year-old man was arrested earlier today on suspicion of sexual activity with a girl under 16. He has been released on police bail pending on-going investigations.

'A blank firing pistol, which replicates the sound of real gunshots but does not require a licence to own, was also recovered during a search of the property.' 

The spokesman also reminded the public that identifying someone who may or may not be a victim of a sexual offence is against the law.

'Victims of sexual assault are guaranteed the legal right to lifetime anonymity and publishing any details, including on social media, which may lead to their identification, is contrary to the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992,' they said.

'Durham Constabulary wishes to remind social media users, and anyone else, who breaks the law that they will be dealt with robustly.'
