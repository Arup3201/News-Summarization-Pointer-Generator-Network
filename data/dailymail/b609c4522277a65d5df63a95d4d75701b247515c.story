From Balenciaga to Chanel, Kim Kardashian has a wardrobe to boot, with designers bending over backwards to dress the star in their creations.

While she has the most esteemed designers on speed dial and finally won plaudits in the fashion world - even landing a Vogue cover - one of fashion's most famous faces has revealed that wasn't always the case.

Esteemed Givenchy designer, Riccardo Tisci, has revealed that he got 'killed' for dressing Kim before the style tide started to turn.

Givenchy's Riccardo Tisci, who is now a close friend of Kim Kardashian's, has revealed what it was like styling her when no one else would

Riccardo, who has long been a good friend of Kanye, told Details that while Kim is a 'sweet girl', she was accepted by 'nobody' in the fickle fashion industry.

He explains that he worked with Kim as a favour to his good friend Kanye - and helped reinvent her. 

'Kanye and me, we did it together,' he said. 'Every designer is dying to dress her now. I didn't care what people thought about Kim. 

'In the beginning, I met her because of my respect for Kanye, and then I liked her a lot and we became friends. I got killed because of this. But I didn't care.'

She recently took the plunge and chopped off her trademark flowing raven locks, and it appears as though Kim Kardashian adopted the same notion for this sartorial offering whilst out in NYC.

Putting her voluptuous curves on display in a pleated black Givenchy gown with a neckline that left very little to the imagination, Kim managed to keep her class intact with the inclusion of a chic silk black blazer completing the all-black ensemble.

Proving she needs no help in regards to her pert chest area, Kim embodied the ‘if you’ve got it, flaunt it’ mantra in the floor-grazing chiffon creation, and despite not being as confident as the reality star, we wouldn’t mind a slice of her style. There's nothing wrong with keeping a classic black gown in the wardrobe as a safe bet!

Although not available to buy online, you can still emulate Kim’s look across the price spectrum (just check the style edit below). Whilst we’ve got our eye on L'Agence's deep-V gown at Saks, we can't help but fall for Missguided's bargain creation at $85.50. We'll be styling ours with minimal black strappy sandals and a metallic clutch bag for our next big night out.

Riccardo went on to dress Kim and Kanye for their wedding and has decked her out in his garments plenty of times ever since. 

Riccardo is right; Kim's metamorphosis has been no mean feat, for while she might now be a firm  favourite with designers, her initial foray into the fashion world was much more humble - as a stylist for  Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan.

In fact, pre-fame, Kim also worked as a personal shopper and she would regularly be dispatched to pick out new outfits for the the heiress and film star.  

Despite her skills as a stylist, her own style left much to be desired. From bright gold dresses to garish satin, she rarely made a 'best-dressed' list in the early part of her career.

Even as she started to make a name for herself, for a long time, Kim was shunned by the designers who now adore her.

'Kanye and me, we did it together,' he said of Kim's reinvention. 'Every designer is dying to dress her now. I didn't care what people thought about Kim'

Just over two years ago, during a photoshoot for ELLE magazine at the end of 2012, many designers refused to lend their clothes to the reality star. 

Nicola Formichetti, artistic director at Diesel, styled the shoot and revealed at the time that calling in high-end samples was a 'challenge.'

He said: 'People wouldn’t lend me the clothes. But that’s fashion snobbery.'

Nicola, who is now good friends with Kim, revealed that the top designers didn't want their designs featured on a woman who had, 'less-than-model-like-proportions''

However, he rightfully predicted at the time, 'She's not the It Girl yet, but she will be.'

It truly seems Formichetti's prediction has come true... Kim has become the ultimate fashion IT girl. 

So close has the designer become to the global stars, that he designed the couple's wedding outfits 

The 34-year-old made sure to credit her favourite outfit - and designer - of the year recently by posting a snap on Twitter with the caption: 'This Givenchy look could possibly be my favorite look of 2014'

Kim has spoken on many an occasion about the rapper and designer's influence over her wardrobe choices.

Her fashion highlights to date include being asked by Carine Roitfeld, the former editor of French Vogue, to cover her CR Fashion book. 

Kim was photographed for the cover picture by Chanel's Karl Lagerfeld and the shoot was art directed by Ricardo Tisci.

It was a controversial choice at the time, but that worked in Kim's favour, as Carine later explained to Time Out.

She said: 'She’s controversial, but so was Marilyn Monroe and I always like controversial people.'

She went on to praise the reality star, saying: 'She was brave...with Karl Lagerfeld shooting.

'She had one guy for hair, one guy for make-up – no extensions or lashes – and for her it must have been like being naked, and she accepted everything.

'I don’t think normally she would wear those sort of clothes – I’ve never seen her in a Comme des Garcons jumpsuit or a basketball jacket, but she said yes to everything. 

'She was the easiest model we’ve had. And when we put a mask on her face, she didn’t say anything.'

Before she found global fame, Kim worked as Paris Hilton's stylist and personal shopper

It was following North's birth in 2013 that it became clear just how popular Kim was becoming with the world's biggest fashion houses though, from the flood of designers that sent clothes for her new arrival, all duly documented on Kim's Instagram page. 

From Givenchy to Celine and Maison Martin Margiela to Alexander Wang, Kim shared photographs of North's adorable new wardrobe, signaling to the world that the fashion supremos were finally beginning to accept her. 

The biggest coup came in April 2014 though, when she and Kanye landed a joint Vogue cover ahead of their May wedding.

The news caused outrage among some of the magazine's subscribers, but the edition went on to be one of the biggest sellers of the year. 

That magazine sold 500,000 copies, beating both Beyonce and Michelle Obama's Vogue covers.  

Not her best: Kim was never known for her fashion choices and her previous wardrobe contained a number of garish outfits like the gold cocktail dress she wore at the Spike TV awards in 2008, left, and, right, in 2010 at the Lorraine Schwartz jewellery launch
