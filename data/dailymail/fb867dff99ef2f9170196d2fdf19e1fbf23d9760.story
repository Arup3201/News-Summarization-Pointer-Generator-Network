Real Madrid and Manchester United have sold an average of 1.5million official replica shirts globally each year over the past five years - making them the two most popular shirts in football.

The commercial giants of Spanish and English football topped sales numbers from the 2009-10 season to the 2013-14 season inclusive, according to figures from authoritative new research by a leading international sports marketing consultancy.

Real Madrid topped the charts, closely followed by Manchester United. Barcelona are No 3 on the sales list, followed by Bayern Munich, Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool.

The strength of the Premier League was once again confirmed, with four English clubs featuring in the top 12 most popular shirt sellers. Spain, France and Italy both provided two teams, while Germany and Turkey providing one team each.

The biggest surprise perhaps is that despite winning a number of trophies in recent seasons, current Premier League champions Manchester City have not yet translated that success into massive shirt sales.

City sold close to 300,000 shirts last season according to the research, but their five-year average is closer to 200,000 per year - not yet enough to bring the club among the biggest sellers.

Based on an average shirt price of £40 for a short-sleeved adult shirt, revenues from shirts alone are worth approximately £60million a year to Real Madrid and Manchester United and £35m to the other leading Premier League clubs.

The figures have been compiled by veteran analyst Dr Peter Rohlmann and his team at the consulting bureau, PR Marketing, who have worked as consultants to major brands, leagues and other organisations.

Rohlmann says: 'Changes of kit supplier and sporting success - as well as global appeal and international presence - continue to be the main reasons for shirt sales.'

In terms of overall merchandise sales – the sale of shirts plus other kit, including boots, tracksuits and other clothing, bags and even club-branded balls (not covered in this research) - it is understood that Manchester United and Liverpool remain the two biggest global sellers, outselling their Spanish rivals.
