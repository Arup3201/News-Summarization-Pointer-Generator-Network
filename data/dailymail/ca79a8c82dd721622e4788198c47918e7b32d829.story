Callum William Moody-Chapman, 17, walked into the sea and drowned after being trolled by a boy who began dating his ex-girlfriend

A teenager walked into the sea and drowned himself after receiving violent threats on Facebook from a boy who had been dating his ex-girlfriend, an inquest has heard.

Callum William Moody-Chapman, 17, was found dead on a beach in Maryport, Cumbria, last December after he was trolled by a thug who said he would stab him, beat him up and set his family's house on fire.

The 17-year-old abuser, who cannot be named, had been a friend but the relationship turned sour when he headbutted Callum to the ground during a row over the girl.

During the vicious exchange, which began a month before Callum's death, the boy wrote: 'I swear to God, shut your lips or I'll cut them off and feed them to you.

He added: 'I'm going to carry on giving you beatings until I can't be bothered anymore.'

Callum tried to calm the situation by saying: 'Why do you always have to resolve stuff with violence?' But the abuse continued.

The inquest in Cockermouth, Cumbria, heard that the youngster, who lived in Grimbsy, had been decorating his aunt's house when he disappeared.

After receiving threats on the morning of his death, Callum phoned his brother Robert in tears and apologised for messing up his life and that of those around him.

He added: 'I have to phone dad and tell him I love him. Give Poppy a kiss from me.'

Describing the phone call, his father Kevin Chapman said: 'All I can remember is at the end of it he said, "Maryport pier looks lovely from here". Then he said, "dad" and I said ‘What’s the matter?’ and he said "I love you".'

Callum had initially arrived in Maryport to visit his grandmother Sandra Chapman on December 6 with Kevin, Robert, Robert’s partner Jemma and baby Poppy.

When the others went home three days later, Callum asked his aunt if he could stay, offering to do decorating for her.

Robert Chapman said: 'I believe Callum chose to stay in Maryport to avoid trouble.'

Callum seemed okay during the week he had stayed with his aunt but was upset on the night of December 14 after having a phone conversation with the girl, the hearing was told.

His body was found on a beach in Maryport, Cumbria, two days after he went missing from his aunt's house

When he heard Callum was missing, the thug sent messages that said: 'I have no contacts in your area. Please tell him I won’t hurt him.'

The 17-year-old has since admitted assault and an offence under the Malicious Communication Act and was given an eight-month referral order.

On the morning of his death, Callum rang his brother and father in tears and apologised for 'messing up' their lives

His mother, Nichola Moody, told The Daily Mirror: 'Callum would be alive today had it not been for his abuser.'

Paying tribute to her son, she added: 'If anybody needed help he’d be the first one there. He had the biggest, bluest eyes and he just won you over.'

Kevin Chapman said: 'I used to call him the class clown. He was just a happy-go-lucky cheeky chappy.

'It’s devastated us. We don’t wish this on anybody.

'You don’t think you’re going to go through it.'

Coroner Simon Ward said it was commendable that he had not retaliated, either to the boy’s headbutt or to the Facebook threats.

Concluding that Callum had killed himself, Mr Ward added: 'It’s clear to me that Callum was being harassed.

'It’s all too easy with social media these days to pursue a campaign like that, sometimes with terrible consequences.'

After the inquest, Callum’s parents said they hoped to help launch a campaign about cyber bullying and encouraged anyone affected by it not to suffer in silence.

Mr Chapman said: 'If they can’t talk to family members speak to each other of find somebody like Childline.

'f you’re being bullied done take it on your own.

'I just hope the story gets out to people of how bad cyber bullying is becoming. We’ll never ever forget Callum, God love him.'

Ms Moody added: 'You don’t want to hear that anybody’s child committed suicide.'
