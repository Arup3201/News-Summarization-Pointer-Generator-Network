An Oklahoma sheriff deputy's backflip and mid-air twist have made him the internet's newest star after a video captured him performing stunts while dunking on the basketball court. 

Deputy Erik Gransberg was on duty at a local high school's fundraising assembly when he captured the spotlight and a standing ovation.

The audience at Edmond Memorial High School first see the basketball coach pass Gransberg the ball as an invitation, only for him to throw it right back.

Oklahoma sheriff deputy Erik Gransberg has become the internet's newest viral sensation after a video captured him performing mid-air twists and backflips on a basketball court 

For his stunt, the deputy runs for a trampoline set up near the net. He then executes a perfect twist in the air as he throws the ball to the court's floor

A student who was running behind Gransberg then jumps off the trampoline and grabs the basketball mid-air before he successfully dunks it 

The assembly's MC pleads 'come on, officer' and the coach tries one more time. This time Gransberg, still in his uniform, accepts.

For his first stunt Gransberg runs across the court and jumps on a trampoline set up near the net. 

He throws the ball against the backboard as the coach runs up behind him, catching it and making a perfect dunk. 

The crowd cheers, unaware that what they had seen was just the deputy's warm-up.

Gransberg then corresponds with a student player and, after a shake of hands for good luck and a wave to the crowd for some support, he's off. 

The deputy runs again for the trampoline, jumping off it to execute a perfect twist in the air as he throws the ball to the court's floor. 

The student comes up behind him to grab it mid-air before successfully dunking it. 

Feeling pumped up after his stunt, Gransberg then does a back-flip on the court as the audience goes wild

Gransberg serves in the community service division of the sheriff's department at night and also works as a civil engineer 

Feeling pumped up after his stunt, Gransberg then does a back-flip on the court as the audience goes wild. He gets a round of high fives before telling the camera 'that's all I got'. 

But Gransberg was being modest. The deputy, who also works as a civil engineer, has been taking center stage for years. 

Gransberg was a mascot and cheerleader for five years at the University of Oklahoma, and then worked as the school's cheer coach and ran the mascot program for another seven, according to Oklahoma's Own. 

The deputy has served as a mascot for a number of minor league basketball teams in Oklahoma City and was also part of Oklahoma City Thunder's acrobatic dunk team the 'Thunder Bolts'.

Gransberg actually got his start in the Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office as a mascot before he went through the academy and earned his badge.

He now works in the community service division, which is what brought him to the fundraising assembly. 

Gransberg has been dubbed the 'Dunking Deputy' and  it's a title he'd 'like to keep', he told Oklahoma's Own.

And although by now he may be a pro, Gransberg said he was still 'just so excited' when he saw the basketball swoosh through the net after his stunt. 

The assembly fundraiser was in honor of the high school's 'Swine Week,' an annual seven-day community service project. It raised a record $701,334 for the Angel Foster Family Network.
