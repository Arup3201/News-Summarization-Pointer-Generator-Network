Much of America is about to get the Arctic shivers.

Meteorologists are confidently forecasting frigid polar air will plunge south into the northern plains, Midwest and then the East Coast from next Tuesday through Thursday. The Midwest should see temperatures well below zero, with single digit lows in much of the East and freezing temperatures as far south as Atlanta, New Orleans and parts of Florida.

National Weather Service meteorologist Paul Kocin, an expert on winter storms, said it is a classic pattern of massive blasts of Arctic air hitting just about everyone east of the Rockies. He said it will rival last year's January Arctic outbreak that introduced the phrase 'polar vortex' to America.

'This is going to be a big cold outbreak, pretty windy as well,' Kocin said. 'It's going to drive all the way down south.'

The wind and cold could mean wind-chill factors that will make the temperature feel like 30 degrees below zero — 50 degrees below zero in Minneapolis and Chicago, said meteorologist Ryan Maue of the private Weather Bell Analytics. He called it 'old-timer's type of cold.'

The mercury is also not expected to reach zero in New York and Boston, while Atlanta and Nashville will see their coldest days of the year.  

Kocin predicts a small Midwestern band of intense snow along with the cold, with some also in parts of the Northeast.

Even though it is several days in advance, meteorologists are pretty sure about this forecast. Kocin said many of the best computer models are saying the same thing.

This is all coming from cold air escaping from the Arctic. The center of the cold air will be around Quebec, Canada, where temperatures — not wind chill — may plunge as low as 40 degrees below zero, Maue said. 

A mix of precipitation on Saturday that included snow, ice and rain affected a swath from the Oklahoma Panhandle - where several inches of snow were in the forecast - to southern New England, where up to a quarter-inch of ice is possible in the eastern Berkshires.

Freezing rain and ice factored into numerous accidents in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ohio and threatened an outdoor hockey game in Toledo.

And parts of the southern U.S. saw heavy rain and thunderstorms, leading the National Weather Service to issue tornado watches and warnings in Mississippi and Louisiana and a flash flood watch for portions of Arkansas.

The weather service reported at least two confirmed tornadoes in Mississippi. Greg Flynn of Mississippi's Emergency Management Agency said homes were damaged in several counties, power lines were downed and there were reports of flooding.

According to the Weather Channel, the chilly winds will hit in two spells. The first, starting today, will impact the northern states, the Midwest and Canada, with parts of the South enjoying temperatures in the mid-60s.

However it will then move east as the week goes on, hitting southern cities including Birmingham, Alabama and Jacksonville, Florida. 

For many parts of the country it will be 35 degrees below average for this time of year, but the cold is only set to last for around a week, with temperatures warming up towards the weekend. 

However another cold spell is expected to hit the Great Lakes and North East the following week.

In general the chill will be experienced further South than it was in the cold spell in January last year.

The forecast for Wednesday shows temperatures dropping around the Great Lakes and Midwest 

However the increase in wind chill, which began over the weekend, push the temperatures down further
