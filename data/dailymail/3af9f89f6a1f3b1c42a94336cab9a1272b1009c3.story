A former paramedic who converted to Islam and joined a militant cell could be the Volgograd train station suicide bomber according to investigators.

The new prime suspect has been identified as Pavel Pechyonkin, and not 26-year-old woman Oksana Aslanova as was previously believed.

Police now think that Pechonkin, who left to join Dagestani militants in 2011, carried out the devastating attack which killed 17 people on Sunday.

The Muslim convert posted a video on 
Youtube saying that he was following God's will, that he would not turn 
back and that he working to earn a place in heaven.

His
 video was in response to a message from his parents Nikolai and 
Fanaziya, begging him not to use violence and described their lives as 
'hell' without him.

Pavel's father Nikolai tearfully appealed to his son to return home, and continue in his medical role

A medical school graduate, his father Nikolai spoke about his conversion: 'My son changed for the better. He stopped arguing with me, did not drink, went to the mosque. I bought him Halal meat.'

Then following a visit to Moscow, he vanished six months ago.

His parents heard he had gone 'in the forest' with rebels and made an internet appeal for him to return.

'Pasha, come back, let your hands be on blood from wounds, injuries, and not from kills, you're a doctor,' said his father.

He replied about his parents' video appeal:  'It was sad to see your tears, very sad. I didn't even want to watch.  I thought it would weaken me. I came here so Allah would be pleased with me, to earn my way to paradise.'

His parents travelled to Dagestan, hoping to find their son and rescue him from the militants they believe indoctrinated him.

The 
Moscow Times reported that his mother said: 'Imagine that somebody were 
to kill your parents, how would that make you feel? Why are you turning 
children into orphans?'

Pechyonkin told his parents that he had then decided he would not be swayed.

He said: 'I didn't want to watch your appeal, I thought that it would weaken me, that it would make me softer.'

He
 added: 'Why should we follow those Christian commandments, when Allah, 
may he be glorified, urges us to fight those kafirs [unbelievers].

'Why shouldn't we leave their children orphaned?'

It is believed that investigators will take DNA from Pechyonkin's father to see if it is a match to tissue found at the scene.

17 people are known to have died in the blast, with more than 50 left injured.

Witness
 Alexander Koblyakov said: ‘People were lying on the ground, screaming 
and asking for help. I helped carry out a police officer whose head and 
face were covered in blood. He couldn’t speak.’

Explosion: CCTV footage capture the blast at Volgograd train station on Sunday

Blast scene: Debris is scattered across the steps of the train station after the blast, which killed 18 people

Casualty: A man lies outside the station as emergency services attend the incident

Wounded: A man, who has sustained injuries to his head, arrives at hospital following the blast

Vladimir
 Markin, a spokesman for Russia’s Investigative Committee, said:  ‘A 
suicide bomber who was approaching a metal detector saw a law 
enforcement official and, after growing nervous, set off an explosive 
device.’

More than 40 people were reported as injured and the death toll could rise, according to Russian officials.

The
 attacker was originally named as Oksana Aslanova, who had twice 
married separatist Muslim gang leaders from the troubled Caucasus 
region, sources said.

She
 had been on Russia’s wanted list for 18 months before the attack which 
used 16lb of TNT, the deadliest in Russia for three years.

The bomb was the equivalent to at least 10kg of TNT, said to Committee spokesman Vladimir Markin, and was stuffed with metal shrapnel.

President
 Vladimir Putin has reportedly instructed special flights to be laid on 
to airlift the injured to Moscow clinics if necessary. 

Metal
 detectors have been mandatory in railway stations and airports 
throughout Russia since a suicide bomber killed 37 people at Domodedovo airport in 2011.

This man, whose hands and face have been bandaged after the blast, was also wounded in the explosion

Body: A victim lies in front of the station entrance as officials survey the damage

Deadly: The attack had heightened concerns in Russia over the security of the upcoming Sochi winter Olympics

Footage from a CCTV camera facing the
 station showed the moment the bomb went off, with a bright orange flash
 emerging from inside the station followed by billowing smoke. 

'Someone
 tried to get inside the train station but was not allowed in,' an 
unidentified law enforcement official told Vysota 102, a local news 
agency. 'After that an explosion went off.'

Among the dead was a police officer checking people entering the train station and a child, The Moscow Times reports.

Local media reports claim taxi drivers queuing for customers outside the station were the first respondents to the emergency.

Volgograd
 mayor, Irina Guseva said the drivers were able to save lives by taking 
injured victims to hospital before ambulances arrived at the scene.

The
 attack comes months after Chechen rebel leader Doku Umarov called for 
new attacks against civilian targets in Russia, including the 2014 Games 
which will take place in Sochi.

No one has yet taken responsibility for the attack that took place this morning at a city centre train station

Emergency services responded to treat victims at the scene of the attack which has raised terrorism concerns ahead of the Winter Olympics

In October, a female suicide bomber 
blew herself up on a  bus in the city where today's attack took place, 
killing six people and injuring about 30.

Officials
 said at the time the attacker came from the province of Dagestan, the 
center of an Islamist insurgency that has spread across the region after
 two separatist wars in Chechnya.

On Friday a car rigged with explosives blew up on a street in Pyatigorsk in the North Caucasus Mountains.
