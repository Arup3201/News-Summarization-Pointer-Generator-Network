Staff at a Veterans Administration clinic locked a retired Marine inside after forgetting he was there.

Jeffrey Duck, 53, said he was baffled when no one came to help him in a consultation room at the VA community clinic in Orange City near Orlando, Florida after more than three hours.

When he went to inquire yet again about whether someone was coming to help him, he found an empty waiting room and office - and took out his cell phone to record the sparse scene.

'I'm kind 
of disappointed,' he told WKMG of the incident. 'Really disappointed.'

Disappointed: Retired Marine Jeffrey Duck was locked inside a VA clinic on Monday after staff forgot about him

Duck, from Deltona, explained how he had gone to the clinic around 1pm on Monday to refill a prescription for pain medication and was expecting to wait a while because he was a walk-in.

He was told to wait and after a couple of hours, he returned to the desk and asked how much longer it was going to be. The longer he waited, the worst pain he was in, he told WOFL.

But even as it neared closing time at 4pm, staff told him to keep waiting to see a doctor. Around 5pm he realized that there was no one left.

'I was apparently left there and forgotten,' he said.

He started to worry that he would be seen and be accused of breaking in, so he took out his cellphone to record the empty hallway and rooms as a burglar alarm started.

He also called 911 to explain the bizarre scenario.

'I apparently got left in a VA facility - a medical facility - and the alarm has been going off,' he told the 911 operator.

'So you're inside and there's no employees?' the operator asked.

'None that I can see,' he replied.

He was eventually freed and his prescription was filled the next morning. The Veterans Administration also issued an apology to Duck on Tuesday.

'We want to apologize to Mr. Duck for his experience yesterday at the Orange City VA Community Based Outpatient Clinic,' they said in a statement. 'We are looking at our closing procedures and will make changes to ensure that this does not happen again.'

He said he wasn't angry, just disappointed. But he added that he hoped that sharing his story would force the VA to look at how they are dealing with veterans.

'There's a lot of people with bigger problems than me,' he said.

Mr Duck was in the Marine Corps between 1979 and 1984, according to his LinkedIn page.
