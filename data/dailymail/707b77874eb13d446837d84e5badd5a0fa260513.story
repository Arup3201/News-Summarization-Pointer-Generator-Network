They say a great holiday should leave you wanting more.Â 

One holidaying couple has taken the notion to new heights by returning to their  favourite seaside location 60 times in the last 10 years.

Pensioners Sid and Joyce Goode, of Nottingham, consider Torquay in Devon their home from home and such is their loyalty to the resort that they still visit six times every year.

Holiday of dreams: Sid and Joyce Goode enjoy stays at Abbey Lawn Hotel so much they visit six times a year

'The staff are so friendly': The pensioners like to sit and watch the world go by, do suduko puzzles and dance

According to them, nothing beats the hospitality and warm welcome they receive at Abbey Lawn hotel behind Torquay seafront.

Sid said: 'When we were in our 80s we loved to dance, so having a dance floor bigger than a postage stamp made the Abbey Lawn perfect for us.

'Now that we are not so mobile we appreciate the two swimming pools and lots of space to read the papers, chat to guests and relax.

Milestone: In December Sid will celebrate his 90th birthday at  hotel and  couple will return next year

'The staff are so friendly.

'The manager Barry is a one-off. I love his sense of humour you can always have a laugh with him.

'In the evenings we have entertainment laid on so there is always something happening and we don't get bored.

'I have my routine of getting the paper, having breakfast and doing a suduko puzzle.

'We like to watch the world go by rather than rushing about on trips and we sometimes look after Barry's dog.'

Sid is looking forward to celebrating his 90th birthday at the hotel in December and the couple have already booked nine luxury coach tours with Robinsons Holidays to the location next year.

Rob Lyng, Robinsons director, said: 'It is wonderful Mr and Mrs Goode enjoy their stays with us so much they return time after time to Torquay.

'To thank them for their years of loyal custom, we are going to give them a free holiday.

'It is the least we can do for two of our favourite guests.'
