A woman who challenged herself to smile at every person she encountered for an entire day has described the 'hostile' reactions she received.

New York City-based Rebecca Jane Stokes, 29, says that her grin 'visibly frightened' one woman and elicited crude remarks from several men.

Chronicling her experience for xoJane, she wrote that smiling at passersby on the street does nothing but stamp 'vulnerable and foolish' on a woman's forehead.

Grin and bear it: Rebecca Jane Stokes , a 29-year-old New Yorker, tried smiling at every stranger she encountered for an entire day

Miss Stokes began the experiment out of frustration that her usual 'blank-to-sad' expression and down-turned lips elicited comments from strangers, such as 'It can’t be THAT bad' or 'Show me that smile, baby girl!'

'If everyone wanted me to smile all the time, why don’t I try smiling, see what that does?' she thought. 

She decided to smile at every person she passed and made eye contact with for a whole day, and found that the endeavor was 'totally exhausting'.

Miss Stokes said that groups of women appeared the most hostile, concluding that they were laughing at the 'desperate need to be liked' that her grin conveyed.

Another woman who initially assumed that she and Miss Stokes knew each other appeared 'visibly frightened' after realizing that a stranger was smiling at her.

And while some men responded to her smile with some innocent 'eye-flirting', one man on the subway asked if she'd ever 'sucked anyone off on the train before'.

Another man even asked if she wanted to have dinner at his mother's house in Sheepshead Bay.

And of course, many people simply ignored her.

'Not to be overly melodramatic but each time you lock eyes with another person and smile and they look away from you and keep going as if they haven’t see you, it's a little bit like they've denied you your humanity,' she wrote.

Miss Stokes concluded: 'My main takeaway from smiling for a day was that it’s a terrible idea if you’re a girl.

Conclusion: Miss Stokes said that smiling at passersby on the street does nothing but stamp 'vulnerable and foolish' on a woman's forehead

'If a man smiles at someone on the street in passing, he’s either a letch or trying to make it clear that he’s courteous and has no immediate plans to murder you. But if you’re a woman all it does it stamp "vulnerable and foolish" and your forehead and leave you running a fever and in desperate need of a drink.'

Miss Stokes isn't alone in her frustration with strangers telling her to smile.

Shoshana Roberts, a 24-year-old aspiring actress, recently walked the streets of New York with a hidden camera and captured unsolicited comments from men such as 'Smile' and 'What's up, beautiful?' in an effort to draw attention to harassment.

She was even followed by some men for several minutes, with one repeatedly asking her: 'You don't wanna talk? Because I'm ugly?' Others winked at her, whistled and made inappropriate noises.

The shocking video, filmed in August, was later posted on YouTube and Facebook by Miss Roberts, who describes herself as 'a New York City-based actress with a black belt'.

Alongside the clip, Miss Roberts wrote: 'This happens daily to so many people. We don't put up with harassment in school, at home, or at work, so why should we have to put up with it on the street?'
