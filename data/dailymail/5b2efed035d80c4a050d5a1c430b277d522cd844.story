Brian Williams career at NBC is effectively over after bosses handed him a six month suspension, according to industry experts

As anchor Lester Holt stepped in for Brian Williams on Wednesday night, it wasn't just the embattled NBC Nightly News host who was missing--his name was yanked from the show's opening title credit.

Suddenly Nightly News with Brian Williams is simply Nightly News.

What's more, while the show's website continued on Wednesday to bear Williams' moniker, Page Six reports the NBC veteran's name will be scrubbed from there, too. 

Meanwhile, Williams' career at NBC is effectively over after bosses handed him a six month suspension according to industry experts who predict that the former star anchor is unlikely to read a teleprompter for the network ever again.

The beleaguered anchor was suspended without pay on Tuesday amid a firestorm of criticism over false claims that he was in a helicopter that was shot at during the Iraq War in 2003.

Lester Holt directly addressed the controversy in Wednesday night's broadcast. 

He first reported statements made by NBC chiefs regarding Williams before assuring the audience, 'We will work every night to be worthy of your trust.'

In his statement, NBC Stephen Burke chief executive wrote:

'By his actions, Brian has jeopardized the trust millions of Americans place in NBC News. His actions are inexcusable and this suspension is severe and appropriate.'

'I know Brian loves his country, NBC News, and his colleagues. He deserves a second chance and we are rooting for him. Brian has shared his deep remorse with me and he is committed to winning back everyone’s trust.'

Something missing? The banner graphic for NBC Nightly News was wiped of Brian Willams' name starting Wednesday

But industry experts are predicting that it is unlikely Williams, 55, will ever return to his position as anchor and managing editor of the flagship Nightly News show.

Williams’ credibility - and by extension that of NBC News - had been under fire for 11 days until his bosses handed out their swift and brutal punishment.

Six months without pay means Williams has effectively been fined $5 million. The network's former star man hasn't commented publicly about his punishment which suggests that he isn't thrilled by his bosses' decision. 

'He’s not going to read a teleprompter at NBC ever again,' television news analyst Andrew Tyndall told The Daily Beast.

Williams' bosses NBC Chief Executive Stephen Burke and Deborah Turness, the president of NBC's news division, issued a joint statement on Tuesday night revealing that the anchor had been suspended

'I’ve never heard of this kind of public announcement saying, "We’re not paying you." Whatever has gone on behind closed doors, they’re daring him to resign.'

The severity of the punishment has lead some to speculate that the report being carried out into Williams had already uncovered enough damning evidence to make his position untenable.

An NBC News veteran who spoke to The Daily Beast on condition of anonymity said they were ‘flabbergasted’ by the punishment.

'What NBC just did, by handing down this kind of six-month sentence, really prevents Brian from redeeming himself in any kind of expedient way. Don’t we agree that when you make a mistake, you correct it immediately, in the world we live in now? What is Brian going to do for the next six months?'

Another option is that NBC simply do away with the Nightly News altogether, argues Michael Wolff in The Hollywood Reporter.

‘The affair exposes the entire make-believe aspects of Williams' job,’ wrote Wolff, who believes that the major networks can no longer compete with other sources of news. 

Weekend Nightly News anchor Lester Holt, right, who had stepped in this week is set to continue to substitute for Williams 

Replacements? The network may consider Today’s Savannah Guthrie and NBC Sports anchor Josh Elliott as possible placements for Williams

‘Network news, as has been evident for a generation, but never as starkly clear as now, is never going to be the network news again. It's finished. Finally. Take a breath.’ 

In a note sent to NBC staff, Deborah Turness, the president of NBC's news division, had described Williams' puffed-up retellings of events from 2003 as 'wrong and completely inappropriate'.

Weekend Nightly News anchor Lester Holt, who had stepped in for Williams this week is set to ‘continue to substitute Anchor the NBC Nightly News,’ said Turness.

Longer term the network may consider on-camera talent, such as Today’s Savannah Guthrie and NBC Sports anchor Josh Elliott, as possible placements for Williams.

The scandal began on January 30, when Williams repeated an often-told anecdote about being on board a Chinook helicopter during the 2003 Iraq invasion.

He said that he was on board a chopper which got hit by a rocket-propelled grenade and was forced to land. In fact, he was on a completely different helicopter.

After being called out on the tall tale by veterans who objected to his glory-grabbing, Williams issued an on-air apology - and said he had been in a 'following' helicopter.

This detail too came under scrutiny, and it emerged his chopper had been part of a different mission and was around half an hour behind.

His plight worsened after other grand, personal stories - from Hurricane Katrina, Israel's 2006 war with Hezbollah, and even a childhood tale of being mugged - were also called into question.

In her note, Turness wrote: 'We have decided today to suspend Brian Williams as Managing Editor and Anchor of NBC Nightly News for six months.

'The suspension will be without pay and is effective immediately.'

'While on Nightly News on Friday, January 30, 2015, Brian misrepresented events which occurred while he was covering the Iraq War in 2003.

'It then became clear that on other occasions Brian had done the same while telling that story in other venues. This was wrong and completely inappropriate for someone in Brian’s position.

'In addition, we have concerns about comments that occurred outside NBC News while Brian was talking about his experiences in the field.'

Williams had just celebrated 10 years as Nightly News anchor last December, when he was also reported to have signed a $50 million contract for an additional five years.

An advertising campaign – voiced by Michael Douglas – that touted his credibility as a reliable news source and featured clips of Williams in Iraq and during Hurricane Katrina was broadcast at the time.

‘It’s a thing that you build slowly, over time. It can happen during big moments. More often, it’s the day-to-day things,’ said Douglas. ‘And what you build, if you work hard enough, if you respect it, is a powerful thing called trust.’

Currently off the air after he admitted to lying about being hit by enemy fire in Iraq, a number of Williams' other seemingly outlandish claims are currently coming under increased scrutiny

Red Bank, New Jersey, 1970s

In a 2011 interview, Brian Williams recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy. However in a 2005 Esquire interview, Williams had claimed to save not one but two puppies.

In the same Esquire interview Williams also revealed that he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling Christmas trees in the sleepy New Jersey town in which he grew up. 

A number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone ‘stuck a .38-caliber in my face'.

Iraq War, 2003

Over the years Williams has told multiple versions of a story about being in an Army Chinook helicopter during the Iraq War in 2003. 

Last month he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire, an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present. 

Williams issued an on-air apology and wrote on Facebook: 'Nobody's trying to steal anyone's valor.'

Hurricane Katrina, 2005

Williams has told several stories about his experiences reporting from New Orleans. 

He has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city's French Quarter – even though the area wasn't flooded. 

The accuracy of other Katrina claims, including that he caught dysentery drinking the flood waters and that his hotel was ‘overrun’ with gangs, have been called into question by others who were on the ground during the disaster. 

Israel, 2006

In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams recalled 'Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in' during a trip to Israel. 

In fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described rocket fire 'six miles away'.

Boston, 2006

A Navy vet accused Williams of lying to skip an event honoring members of the Armed Forces so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live.

On the day of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society event the NBC News anchor told organizers that a 'pressing engagement' meant he wouldn't be able speak at the dinner, but later that evening he appeared in a walk-on role on SNL's Weekend Update.
