Chelsea were stunned on New Year's Day as Tottenham put five goals past Jose Mourinho's defence. Sportsmail's ROB DRAPER rates the performances of every player at White Hart Lane. 

TOTTENHAM 

Hugo Lloris 7

Solid and dependable, as ever, he had an unusually quiet night but was strong in that nervous period after Chelsea’s second and until Tottenham’s fifth when all at White Hart lane suspected capitulation was coming.

Kyle Walker 6.5

A good performance all round – helpful in attack and decent in defence.

Jan Vertonghen 7

The stronghold of the Tottenham defence and the protagonist in most of the physical battles – confronting Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas at different times when necessary.

Federico Fazio 5.5

What was he thinking when he lost the ball on the hour to allow Hazard to score? Tottenham were totally in control up to that point and then had to endure a nervous period as famous capitulations, notably to Manchester United in 2001, came to mind.

Danny Rose 6.5

Got out-run by Hazard for the first goal – but was first to react to Chadli’s shot off the post to score to make in 2-1.

Ryan Mason 6

Hard to mark properly as he departed after 10 minutes with a muscle pull.

Nabil Bentaleb 7

Growing maturity from the French-born Algerian. Tottenham won the key midfield battles and Bentaleb was at the heart of that.

Andros Townsend 7

Cooly-taken penalty and his pace was a worry all night for Chelsea until he came off for Paulinho on the hour.

Christian Eriksen 7.5

Set up Chadli for the shot that led to goal No. 2 and was a nuisance to Chelsea all night. A key man.

Nacer Chadli 8

Created one goal with his shot against the post and scored another – slightly fortunately – with a deflection off John Terry. But ran all night and deserved his goal.

Harry Kane 9

Another superb performance – tireless running, two goals and a penalty won. He gave Gary Cahill a horrible evening. England beckons.

Subs

Mousa Dembele 7

Started slowly after replacing Mason but grew into a game in which Tottenham established midfield control, partly thanks to him.

Paulinho 6

Provided the necessary steel in midfield when Spurs were looking to go all wobbly.

Ben Davies 6

Did little wrong after replacing Danny Rose at the end.

Manager  

Mauricio Pochettino 8 

Tottenham finally look a little like the dynamic, pressing side he craves. His best game yet at Spurs.

CHELSEA  

Thibaut Courtois 6

Conceded five but didn’t have a bad game’ wasn’t truly at fault for any of the goals.

Branislav Ivanovic 6

Dependable if not his best night. But unlike colleagues, he at least put in a performance close to his normal game.

Gary Cahill 5

A grim evening for the England centre half – Harry Kane ran him ragged. At least they should be team-mates soon – in the national team.

Gary Cahill, here being closed down by Kane, did not have his best day at the office

John Terry 7

The strongest of the Chelsea back four – but for almost the first time this season even his durability could not prevent them looking vulnerable. Popped up for the consolation goal at the end.

Cesar Azpilicueta 5

The Premier League best left back looked tired – despite being rested at Southampton. Uncharacteristic errors were already creeping into his game before he gave the ball away for the second goal.

Nemanja Matic 5.5

Started well but when he was brushed aside by Harry Kane for the fourth goal it looked as though the tiredness of a first Christmas in England had got the better of him.

Cesc Fabregas 5.5

Delightful on the ball, his pass for Hazard for Chelsea’s second was a delight – but shockingly lax as he allowed Kane to brush past him for the equalising goal.

Willian 5.5

Couldn’t get in the game as Chelsea fell to pieces and was eventually replaced by Salah

Oscar 5

Like Fabregas, was underwhelming when required to stop Kane for that equalising goal. His alertness won Chelsea their first goal – but he paid the price at half time for defensive lapse when Mourinho took him off

Eden Hazard 8

Superb in that opening thirty minutes and his run to set up Costa’s goal was a triumph of determination and skill – as was his ability to win the ball off Fazio and exchange passes with Fabregas for the second. Set up the third as well with his cross.

Diego Costa 7

A first Christmas period but he didn’t stop running, nor harrying and got his goal. When Chelsea fell apart, his influence diminished but that was hardly his responsibility

Subs

Ramires 5.5

Came off to give Chelsea more strength in midfield – but couldn’t prevent Chelsea’s being pulled apart at time

Mohamed Salah 5.5

A rare appearance for the Egyptian but little impact in his 18 minutes.

Manager 

Jose Mourinho 6 

No great tactical failings - it simply looked as if tiredness got the better of a previously solid defence.

Referee

Phil Dowd 6

Despite Mourinho's complaints there were no major errors. The Vertonghen handball was accidental and the Hazard decision spot on.
