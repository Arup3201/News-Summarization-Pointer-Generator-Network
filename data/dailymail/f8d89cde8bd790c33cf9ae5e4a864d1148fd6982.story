Holland coach Guus Hiddink let rip at his players following their last-gasp 2-1 defeat to Czech Republic in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier.

An awful defensive mistake from Newcastle's Daryl Janmaat gifted Vaclav Pilar an injury-time winner in Hiddink's first competitive match in charge.

Janmaat headed Borek Dockal's cross against his own post and could only look on in horror as Pilar anticipated the rebound to convert from a couple of yards.

Holland had earlier got back on level terms thanks to Stefan de Vrij cancelling out Dockal's opener in Prague.

'I was livid,' Hiddink told the Dutch Football Association website. 'If you can't win, make sure you don't lose.'

Janmaat admitted he felt like an idiot after the mistake.

'I wanted to head the ball back to (goalkeeper) Jasper (Cillessen), but I got it wrong,' he told www.telegraaf.nl.

'I feel very silly, but it was my fault.'
