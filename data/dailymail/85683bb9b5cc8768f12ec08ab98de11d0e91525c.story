Three security guards have reportedly been 'sacked' from the Commonwealth Games for taking selfies with Usain Bolt.

The members of staff employed by Sword Security were on duty at the Lesser Hampden training ground in Glasgow yesterday when they are said to have approached the fastest man in the world to ask for a photo.

They were then 'punted' or sacked by a supervisor who had asked them to put their mobile phones away while the Jamaican sprinter was training.

Photo opportunity: Two security guards have reportedly been sacked for taking a selfie with Usain Bolt during the Commonwealth Games (incident not pictured)

Selfie: The incident involving the two security guards is said to have happened at the Lesser Hampden training ground in Glasgow where the Jamaican Sprinter is currently preparing for the 4x100m relay tomorrow night

A statement by the company confirmed the guards in question had been removed from their roles at the Games for breaching their conditions of employment, but were still employed at the firm.

The athlete was using the track to prepare for the 4x100m relay which takes place at Hampden Park tomorrow night.

Officials are now said to have told staff at the games to be professional and not approach athletes for 'selfies'.

An official from the Commonwealth Games, Glasgow 2014, said: 'When Bolt is in house, people are reminded he's here to compete not to pose for personal photos. People are reminded to concentrate on their jobs and the job at hand.' 

A source told The Evening Standard that a supervisor told those on duty that they should not take photos with their mobile phone. 

It is the latest controversy surrounding the Jamaican sprinter who apparently told a reporter that the Commonwealth Games were 'bulls***'

However, after watching the Jamaican netball team lose to New Zealand yesterday, the 27-year-old said they were in fact ‘awesome’ and dismissed his earlier alleged negative remarks as ‘all lies’.

Bolt is said to have complained about Glasgow 2014 to The Times as he waited in the rain for a car outside the athletes’ village on Tuesday, just hours after meeting the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry.

Scandal: The Jamaican sprinter has already been at the centre of controversy during the Commonwealth Games. He is said to have told a reporter earlier this week that they were 'bulls***'

Royal meeting: He allegedly complained about the games hours after being introduced to Prince Harry
