Indian King of England: DNA tests show Prince William is of Indian descent

DNA testing has revealed that Prince William will become the first British monarch of Indian ancestry.

A clear genetic line has been drawn between the Duke of Cambridge and a half-Indian woman, potentially marking him as the first King whose bloodline is descended from the country.

Analysis of saliva samples on relatives of Prince William revealed the link between the second in line to the throne and a distant relative from his mother’s family.

The revelation will prompt calls for the 30-year-old prince to make his maiden visit to India, following in the footsteps of his parents who travelled there in 1992.

The genetic link with India is believed to originate from Williams’s great-great-great-great-great grandmother Eliza Kewark.

Although often described as Armenian, DNA analysis has revealed that she was at least half-Indian and is known to have lived in the country’s western region.

Scottish scientists established the link after discovering that Eliza’s descendants carried a rare strand of DNA - known as mitochondrial DNA - which can only be passed on by a mother.

Only people from the Indian subcontinent have been found to carry the particular strand of DNA. It has been recorded in 14 other people - all Indian, apart from one Nepalese native.

The DNA is thought to have been passed down to Prince William and his brother Harry, as the scientist behind the research described the genetic link as ‘unassailable’.

The tests were carried out by genetics expert Jim Wilson, from the University of Edinburgh and a group called BritainsDNA, who said that the princes would be unable to pass the DNA to their children.

It has not been revealed which relations of William supplied the saliva samples to allow the DNA to be tested.

Princess Diana’s maternal aunt Mary Roach
 told The Times: ‘I always assumed that I was part-Armenian so I am 
delighted that I also have an Indian background.’

Kewark was married to Scotsman Theodore Forbes, who left his wife and sent their daughter, Katherine, to live in Britain aged six.

Letters sent from Kewark to her estranged husband were discovered by researchers in which she begged to be able to see her children again.

The communication suggests that Forbes
 turned his back on his wife, potentially due to her race, referring to 
her as his ‘housekeeper’ in his will after he died returning to Britain 
on a ship in 1820.

He also described her as the ‘purported mother’ of Katherine.

Mitochondrial DNA, also known as the Eve Gene, is inherited solely from the mother in most species, including humans.

Tracing the gene has become an important tool in anthropology and field biology as it allows scientists to study links between populations.

It is believed to have evolved separately from nuclear DNA, deriving from the circular genomes of bacteria engulfed by the early ancestors of the modern-day eukaryotic cells.

According to the Bradshaw Foundation, it is believed by some molecular biologists that at one stage the mitochondrion was a free-living organism with its own DNA.

They say it also held the key for generating lots of energy. It then invaded single-celled nucleated organisms and has remained ever since.

While males cannot pass the DNA on to their children, they do receive and use their mother's mitochondrial DNA.

If the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge do decide to make a state visit to the country after the expected birth of the couple’s baby in July, the second in line to the throne will hope that their experience is more harmonious than his parents.

Princess Diana was famously pictured sitting alone outside the Taj Mahal, an Indian landmark regarded as symbol of love, without her husband in sight.

His direct genetic lineage could be seized upon by Buckingham Palace as a way of boosting the British monarchy’s popularity in the country.

Alistair Moffat, the founder of BritainsDNA, said: ‘Knowing something about your DNA and its origins in prehistory definitely changes your sense of yourself, and one way that it does that is to make you feel part of a world community.’

Historian Alistair Moffat told 
MailOnline how before India became a part of the British Empire in the 
mid-19th century, it was governed by the East India Company, who 
employed armies and generals and even fought wars, including Robert 
Clive's famous campaign against the French which culminated in the 
victory at Plassey.

Mr Moffat said: 'When Henry Dundas 
became Governor General of the East India Company, he began to appoint 
more and more Scots to important positions.

'When Theodore Forbes came to Leith 
to work, he probably came into contact with the tea merchants who 
brought tea to Britain in the tea clippers, the wonderful sailing ships.
 Perhaps the Cutty Sark is the best known.

'Scottish entrepreneurs had invested so heavily in the Indian tea industry that it outstripped production in China.

'As the third son of a Scottish 
landowner, Forbes needed to make his fortune elsewhere and like many 
ambitious young men, he went to India to do just that.

'When Forbes arrived in the Bombay 
Presidency he employed a housekeeper, Eliza Kewark. They had three 
children, one of whom, Catherine or Kitty, was the ancestress of 
Princess Diana.'

Prince William's Indian ancestry can be traced back through his family tree which reveals his genetic link with Eliza Kewark.

Kewark had three children with Theodore Forbes after he arrived in India, working for the East India Company.

One of their children, Katherine, became a well-respected member of society in Scotland and married James Crombie, a member of the family that manufactured the coats of the same name, in Aberdeen, in March 1837.

The pair had eight children including Jane Crombie, who was born in November 8, 1843, and married David Littlejohn.

Their daughter, Ruth Littlejohn, was born in 1879, who married Colonel William Smith Gill in 1898.

Ruth Littlejophn then gave birth to Ruth Sylvia Gill eight years after the turn of the century, who lived until July 6, 1993.

She became styled as Baroness Fermony after she married Edmund Burke Roche, 4th Baron Fermoy, in September 1931.

She
 held the office of Justice of the Peace between June 1956 and March 
1960, before she became the Woman of the Bedchamber to HM Queen Elizabeth 
The Queen Mother, and was invested as a Dame Commander, Royal Victorian 
Order, in 1966.

Among her children was Princess Diana's mother, the Hon Frances Burke Roche, born on January 20, 1936, in Sandringham, Norfolk.

She
 married Edward John Spencer, 8th Earl Spencer, and they had five children 
together, including Diana, before they divorced in 1969.

She then went on to marry Peter Shand Kydd.
