A baby elephant almost found its way into an early grave after falling down a  pit at a nature reserve in southwest China's Yunnan Province.

The calf was immediately trapped within the four walls of smooth dry earth and struggled to raise itself back up.

Fortunately, some local villagers found the hungry and dehydrated animal squealing for help on Tuesday and recorded its exciting rescue.

Police came bearing some basic tools to help it climb out of its temporary confinement which was approximately two-meteres deep.

In the footage, one man can be seen using a rake to break down the parched soil while another pours water down the hole for the elephant to drink via its trunk.

The calf has quite a struggle as it attempts to hike its body up and its legs slip and slide because the unstable land is hard to keep hold of.

Yet it gets a lot of encouragement from the group who cheer it on as it lifts its self to freedom.

It takes a lot of strength for the exhausted elephant to maneuver its body and it stops to have a break while hanging from the hole.

Trapped: A baby elephant finds itself in a life-threatening situation after falling down an empty water storage ditch in China 

Slippery slope: The elephant is unable to set itself free after slipping into the pit the previous day when it was raining 

One of the rescuers says: 'Looking at the traces at the scene, it probably fell into it yesterday [Monday].

'Because it rained yesterday, the ground around the pit was slippery.'

After a necessary break, the elephant continues with the strenuous, life-saving exercise.

An hour down the line, it reaches the top and roams free in the forest while onlookers wail with excitement.

Challenging: Local villagers use a rake to break down the wall but the elephant still struggles to keep its footing on the slanted wall as the soil buckles under its weight

Freedom! Finally, the calf escapes and runs away from the site
