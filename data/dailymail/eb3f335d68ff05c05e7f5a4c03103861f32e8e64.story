The widow of Michael Winner has spoken out about her relationship with the ebullient film director, silencing speculators who think the couple spent all their time in lavish restaurants and luxury Caribbean resorts, saying the truth is they just used to 'stay at home and have a giggle',

Geraldine Winner, who met Winner in 1957 when she was just 16, but didn't marry him until 2011, says behind doors they had 'the most tremendous fun'.

Speaking on Lorraine Kelly's ITV breakfast show this morning, Geraldine, whose husband died in January this year after a long battle with liver disease, said she is taking his death 'day by day', and is planning a big memorial event to celebrate his life.

Geraldine Lynton-Edwards met her future husband when she was an aspiring dancer and actress, but after a short romance she went to France and he to Hollywood, and though they remained friends while apart for 40 years, it wasn't until 2002 that they reunited and became a couple again.

Though Winner had always said he would never marry, he finally proposed to Geraldine in 2007, half a century after they first met, and the pair were married in 2011.

'I'm
taking it day by day,' she told Lorraine today. 'Luckily I have a lot of help. We met when I was 
16, and there was definitely an attraction. And for the 50 years that we were apart we kept in touch. He wasn't the one who got away - he never got away!'

Geraldine, who is currently organising a large-scale memorial for her late husband, explained that reuniting was tricky.

She said: 'Getting back together was difficult after so much time, you have to get used to somebody else's character.

'But we had a nice life together. Behind closed doors he was fun. We just used to giggle.

'We had the most tremendous giggles. Sometimes he'd be grumpy and I'd tell him not to be grumpy, and sometimes or I'd be grumpy and he'd tell me to stop.

'People thought we were out the whole time but really we spent a lot of time at home.'

The home the couple shared - a 47-room mansion in west London's Holland Park called Woodland House - is currently on the market, and an anonymous buyer has just reportedly put in a bid for £50m.

When asked about the cost, Geraldine said she didn't really know much about it, and has 'people who take care of that'.

Winner spent millions renovating the palatial home after buying it as a set of flats and reinstating the building to its former grandeur.

The house sits on the bend of a leafy crescent in Kensington and was built in the Queen Anne style by Richard Norman Shaw for a Victorian artist called Sir Luke Fildes.

The house was originally three flats, which were bought by Winner's property magnate father, George, and it remains leasehold. The freeholder is Charlotte Townsend, one of Britain's richest women.

Winner took possession of the house in 1978 when it was still flats, and spent millions creating an opulent home, complete with swimming pool, cinema and extensive gardens, which he loved.

Some of the rooms were created by 
interior designer Tessa Kennedy and some by Winner himself, and contain 
lavish fabrics and decorations as well as collections of objets d’art.

The
house and gardens have more than 3,400 electric bulbs in them, and the 
garden is lit up so dramatically that Winner used to joke that his house
was visible from space.

Woodland House, in Holland Park, west London, is thought to be on the market for around £50m
