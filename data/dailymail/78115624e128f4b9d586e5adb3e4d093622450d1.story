Threatening: Released from the Vatican archives for the first time, this 1530 letter - a 3ft-wide parchment with 81 wax seals attached to red silk ribbons - sent by English noblemen urged Pope Clement VII to annul Henry VIII's marriage to his first wife so the king could marry Anne Boleyn

A group of English noblemen threatened the Roman Catholic Church when they wrote to the Pope urging him to annul Henry VIII's marriage to his first wife so the king could marry Anne Boleyn, a letter released by the Vatican has revealed.

The document, signed by MPs and clergy including the Archbishop of Canterbury, alluded to the 'extreme remedies' they could pursue if Pope Clement VII refused their request.

The 1530 letter - a 3ft-wide parchment with 81 wax seals attached to red silk ribbons - preceded Henry's divorce from Catherine of Aragon and clearly illustrates his rejections of the Pope's authority.

It is one of 100 documents from the Vatican Secret Archives that yesterday went on public display in Rome's Capitoline Museums for the first time.

The exhibition also marks the first time the documents have been allowed outside Vatican City.

Henry VIII's split from Catherine of Aragon led to his breakaway from the Catholic Church and the establishment of the Church of England.

The letter is considered a 'priceless document of great historical significance.'

In historical terms, it has only recently been discovered, having been found in 1926 by Angelo Mercati, Prefect of the Archives, hidden in a chest built under a chair.

The peers warn the Pope in no uncertain terms that 'a refusal of annulment would require recourse to extreme measures for the good of the kingdom which we would not hesitate to take,' and was sent from London in July 1530 taking two months to arrive on the Pope's desk.

The Pope refused to annul the marriage, setting in motion a chain of events that led to a split from the Catholic Church and the start of the English Reformation.

Among the other items on display is a 60-metre parchment scroll documenting proceedings of the Trial of the 
Knights Templar medieval Christian military order, accused of heresy and
sexual misconduct.

It is partially rolled out in one room of the museums, 
alongside secret manuscripts, letters and codices.

Elsewhere, a
register containing the excommunication of 16th century German reformer
Martin Luther, and a report on the 1633 trial of Italian astronomer Galileo 
Galilei for asserting that Earth 
revolved around the Sun, are on show.

A
letter dated May 1887 from the Ojibwe Indians of Ontario to Leo XIII, 
written on bark 
birch and thanking him for sending missionaries to convert them, 
colourfully alludes to the Canadian Spring as 'where there is much grass
in the 
month of the flowers'.

Sensitive
letters from before and during the Second World War have not been released -
the period is a contentious one as many historians have questioned 
whether then Pope Pius XII did enough to speak out against Adolf Hitler.

Archivist
Pier Paolo Piergentili said this is the first time in the archive's 
400-year history that it is opening up a selection of documents for 
public display.

He said:
'The aim is to physically show the sources of history, and make 
available the documents that have created history in Europe, and not 
only Europe.'

Documents 
in the Vatican Secret Archives span the 8th to the 20th century and are 
stored on 85km of shelving at different sites within the sovereign 
state.

Part of the collection is open for researchers upon request.

Founded by Pope Paul V in 1612, the archives contain all deeds and documents pertaining to the government of the Church.

The
exhibition, Lux in Arcana: The Vatican Secret Archive Reveals Itself, 
runs from March until September and aims to demystify the Church's 
records.

Author
Dan Brown's blockbuster novel, and its subsequent film adaptation 
Angels and Demons, focused heavily on the Vatican's archives with its 
miles of dusty bookshelves and musty, 
centuries-old documents.

The
film shows it as a state-of-the-art building with bullet-proof glass 
and electronic records.

But in reality the archive is very different, with
a painstakingly complied handwritten card index.

It is set across two floors below the
Vatican, is built to resist the effects of an atomic blast, and is 
known affectionately to the archivists who work there as 'the bunker'.

In
Angels and Demons, hero Robert Langdon - played by Tom Hanks - is seen 
consulting 400-year-old documents relating to the trial of heretic 
Galileo Galilei as he tries to crack a secret code.

In a race against time, his assistant Vittoria Vetra decides 
the best way to examine it is to rip the papers out as guards chase them out of 
the archive with Langdon firing a gun wildly.

Real-life, of course, is slightly more mundane.

The signature of Galileo Galilei is seen on a document displayed as part of the exhibition. A report on the Italian astronomer's 1633 trial for asserting that Earth revolved around the Sun, is on show

The register of the Oaths of Fealty (1356-1359) to Pope Innocent VI is also on display. It is opened on the page about Cardinal Gil de Albornoz's political and military actions

Only
accredited scholars - and not the general public - are allowed in the 
reading rooms once their credentials have been thoroughly checked.

The documents are then brought to them by white-gloved archivists. Moving 
from your desk unchecked, meanwhile, is strictly forbidden.

Pope Benedict's 
number two, Secretary-of-State Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, was yesterday among 
the first to visit the exhibition, which will run until September and which is 
expected to draw thousands of visitors.

As
he left the exhibition, Cardinal Bertone made a reference to a series of
leaks from the Vatican in recent weeks.

Documents 
have appeared in the Italian media detailing allegations of corruption as 
well as an alleged plot on Pope Benedict's life, in what has 
unsurprisingly been dubbed 'Vatileaks' and created a poisonous 
atmosphere within the Holy See.

Cardinal Bertone said: 'These are the only true documents which should be focused on and what strikes me is their history.'

In
Britain, National Archives are available after a set period of time, but 
the Vatican follows a different formula with papers and documents only 
being released one Pope at a time.
