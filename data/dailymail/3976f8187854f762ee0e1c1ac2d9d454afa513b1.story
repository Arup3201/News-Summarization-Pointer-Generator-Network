They might look very different but Blue and Trooper clearly believe they are from the same pack.

The Rottweiler puppy and kangaroo were filmed having a tumble at their home in Perth on Thursday.

Their owner, Ed Trindall, who filmed the encounter, said that the two creatures have a developing 'relationship'.Scroll down for video

Unusual playmates: Perth man Ed Trindall filmed his Rottweiler Trooper and his companion Blue the Kangaroo having a bit of fun on Thursday

'Blue the roo and Trooper my rotty pup, best of friends. This video I would like to share with you as it shows an amazing relationship between two species. I hope you enjoy it,' he wrote in the video’s description.

The video certainly does exhibit a blossoming friendship between the two companions, as they bounce around together.

At first, Blue is seen teasing the young pup by mussing up his black fur.

Trooper got his own back eventually, chasing and stomping on the kangaroo's tail

Trying to get his own back, Trooper nips at the kangaroo’s arms while his tail is clearly seen wagging playfully.

It's not long before the two of them are hopping in circles after one another, with the pup cheekily trampling on the kangaroo’s tail.

But little Trooper soon gets tired, lying at Blue’s feet briefly while he receives some grooming form the brown roo.

However, it's not the first time that a dog and a kangaroo have developed a strong bond.

The antics of Dozer the dog and Love Bug the kangaroo, are also well documented by their owner, with the duo often seen sharing a kiss and a cuddle on Youtube.
