Imported blue cheese (above), Feta and halloumi have all been found to have excess levels of salt

Some popular foreign cheeses contain more salt than sea water, say campaigners.

New research found halloumi, a Cypriot cheese, imported blue cheese and Greek Feta had salt levels exceeding seawater, while cottage cheese had the lowest.

A study also shows large variations in salt content among the same types of cheese.

Some types of cheddar - the most popular choice among Britons - had much higher levels of salt than others, with supermarket own brands having lower levels than branded counterparts.

An investigation into more than 600 cheeses sold in the top seven UK supermarkets found the average salt content was 1.7g per 100g of cheese.

Halloumi and imported blue cheese contained 2.7g, and Feta 2.5g - Atlantic seawater is equivalent to 2.5g per 100g of table salt.

Cheese spread, often given to children, contained 1.88g/per 100g of cheese, while cottage cheese had the least salt at 0.55g/per 100g

Campaigners said the new study, published in the journal BMJ Open, shows some cheese makers are not going far enough to reduce salt levels, putting their customers’ health at risk.

Despite many cheese makers meeting the recommended Department of Health salt targets, four out of five cheeses were high in salt.

Cheese is one of the 10 biggest contributors of salt to the UK diet - cheddar and cheddar-style cheese being most popular – and the average person consumes 9kg (20 pounds in weight) of cheese every year.

On average, salt content tended to be higher in branded (1.78g/100g) than in the supermarket own label (1.72g/100g) cheddar and cheddar-style cheeses – 3.5 per cent higher.

The difference in salt content between supermarket and branded products means it is technically possible to produce cheese with less salt, say campaigners.

Excess salt is a major contributor to high blood pressure, leading to heart disease and stroke.

Although UK intake has fallen in recent years, the average daily intake of 8.6g remains above the target level of 6g.

New targets commit the UK to working towards a maximum 5g a day by 2025.

Study co-author Dr Kawther Hashem, from Queen Mary University of London, who is also nutritionist for the campaign group Consensus Action on Salt and Health (CASH), said: ‘These results provide evidence that the UK salt reduction strategy, based on a series of salt targets for different food groups, is working, but that the targets need to be much more stringent if we are to get salt intakes down to less than 6g a day.

‘These big brands need to stop dragging their heels and catch up with the supermarkets now, or they will be left behind.

‘It’s worth looking at the label and choosing a lower salt and fat version of your favourite cheese, or better yet, to eat very small amounts.

‘Children’s cheeses are often marketed as ‘healthy’, yet can contain at least the equivalent of 75 per cent seawater per 100g on average - these cheeses should only be given to children occasionally, or not at all.’

CASH chairman Professor Graham MacGregor said: ‘Reducing salt is one of the most cost-effective measures to reduce the number of people suffering and dying from stokes, heart attacks and heart failure.

‘Cheese is a big contributor of salt to the UK diet and it is vital that the Department of Health forces the cheese industry to implement the new targets immediately.’

Dr Judith Bryans, Chief Executive of Dairy UK, the body that represents the industry, said: 'Salt is in an integral part of the cheesemaking process for technical and safety reasons.

'In an effort to provide British consumers with nutritious, safe and wholesome cheeses, the dairy industry has made significant steps forward to reduce the salt content of dairy products over the last few years and cheese manufacturers have worked very hard to overcome technical barriers to salt reduction.

'However, lowering salt levels irresponsibly would raise a number of concerns for the cheese industry in terms of food safety and quality.

'Cheese is only one food which contributes to consumers’ salt intakes and other food groups contribute significantly more.

'Cheddar cheese in particular contributes to only 1 per cent of salt intake in the UK - less than most food groups.'
