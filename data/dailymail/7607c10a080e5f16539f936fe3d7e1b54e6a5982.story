The late Lilly Pulitzer's name is synonymous with bold tropical prints. Now, as her showstopping Palm Beach home is given a $3millon price cut, it is clear to see where she got her inspiration.

The 1.4acre estate, which comprises 9,000sq ft of living space across a four-bedroom house, a three-bedroom 'casita' and a two-bedroom pool house, was the home of the fashion designer for over 30 years until her death earlier this month.

It has been for sale since January 2011 at $11.5million, but last week that figure was chopped to $8.5million.

The agent selling the property is Pulitzer's daughter, Liza, who admits she hopes the new owners do not simply buy it for the land, and destroy the family home.

'It's the largest (non-waterfront) Estate Section lot,' she told The Palm Beach Daily News. 'We're marketing it at land value. When it goes, there wonâ€™t be another interior lot of this size'

She added to the New York Observer: 'We would hate to see the house torn down, but the house is not landmarked.'

Family home: Pulitzer and her second husband, Enrique Rousseau, purchased the plot in 1980 for just $565,000. The various accommodations on the site were built in 1983

The property was initially put on the market because Pulitzer was finding its upkeep a challenge.

She told the Wall Street Journal at the time: 'It's just magnificent, but I'm old and I'm cranky and I can't keep it up the way it should be.'

The decor and gardens are typical of the designer's style. Faded prints and palm trees adorn furniture both indoors and outdoors, while tropical landscaping and the pool make for a sensational backdrop.

'We were very Cuba,' Pulitzer wrote in a book about herself and Rousseau.

Lilly Pulitzer launched her business in the 1950s - by accident. She was socialite
 with time to spare and a wealthy husband who owned citrus groves, so 
she started a juice stand on a busy shopping street.

She needed dresses in tropical prints 
(no dowdy aprons for Lilly!) that would hide stains. The loose, 
sleeveless cotton shape that came to be known as the shift was perfect 
for the task and local climate.

'I designed collections around 
whatever struck my fancy . . . fruits, vegetables, politics or peacocks! I
 entered in with no business sense. It was a total change of life for 
me, but it made people happy,' Pulitzer told The Associated Press in 
2009.

'Her clothes were transporting,' said
 Adam Glassman, creative director of O, The Oprah Magazine. 'You 
automatically think of Palm Beach, or sunny California in a Slim Aarons 
photograph.'

The
 brand was purposefully inclusive, said Janie Schoenborn, now the vice 
president of creative communications of Lilly Pulitzer's former company.

'If someone is wearing the same print, 
you high five them! I don't want to use the word "club," though, because
 that seems exclusive. Anyone who is happy and wants to have a good time
 can come to our party.'

Schoenborn said Lilly Pulitzer occupies a
 unique spot in the fashion world. 'It's so not fashion-y, but it is 
fashion because it has such a strong point of view.'

'The look is colorful, it tends to be 
preppy - it's an iconic American look based on a lifestyle that's based 
around these prints,' Glassman said.

Pulitzer
 also paved the way for today's popular lifestyle brands, including Tory
 Burch, Tibi and Milly, and even Ralph Lauren, Glassman added.

It
 was a different business than the avant-garde catwalk designers showing
 in Europe during the '60s. It was about loyalty and longevity instead 
of drastic swings of the pendulum.

Then-first
 lady and fashion plate Jacqueline Kennedy, a former schoolmate of 
Pulitzer, wore one of the shifts in a Life magazine photo spread, 
confirming the look's legitimacy.

Pulitzer
 retired from the day-to-day business in 1993 after a rough patch in the
 Eighties era of power dressing. But the company and its hallmark prints
 have returned to profitability.

Sales
 of the brand were strong in the earnings period that ended Feb. 2, 
according to parent company Oxford Industries' report. Revenue increased
 26per cent to $29.1 million.

Pulitzer's attitude is still pervasive 
at the company and in new products, said Schoenborn. 'If we've put a 
twinkle in your eye, then we have honored her.'
