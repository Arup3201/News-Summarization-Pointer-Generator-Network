A massive search was going on last night after a British sailor fell from his yacht in the Pacific, leaving his terrified fiancée on  board alone.

The woman, also from the UK, had little sailing experience and was unable to keep track of the man as he was carried out of sight in the shark-infested waters.

She was later plucked to safety by a US Navy helicopter after calling rescue services in Britain.

Resources: The U.S. Navy diverted the USS Peleliu, an amphibious assault ship that was headed homeward, to assist in the search for the captain

Her 35-year-old partner had still not been found yesterday, more than two days after falling overboard 500 miles from land.

He was reportedly conscious and 
wearing a life jacket when he fell overboard. She used the satellite 
phone on the 38ft yacht to call the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre 
in Falmouth, Devon.

Officials immediately contacted the US Coast Guard in Hawaii to launch a rescue operation.

The couple, who have not been named, were sailing towards Hawaii when they hit trouble 2,000 miles short of their destination.

They were about 500 miles west of the 
Midway Atoll, a volcanic island best known as the scene of the  Battle 
of Midway in the Second  World War. The area was too remote to be 
reached quickly by boat and winds were reported at 25mph with 6ft 
swells.

US Coast Guard spokesman Eric Chandler
said four Navy helicopters were combing the region around the clock, 
along with two Coast Guard HC-130 Hercules planes and a US Navy warship 
which had been diverted to help.

He said: ‘I don’t know what made the 
sailor fall overboard. The female with him said he was conscious at the 
time and he was wearing a yellow life jacket.

‘It’s real challenging out there. We can’t get our cutters out there.’

The man fell overboard at about 11.30pm on Saturday.

The woman was airlifted to the USS Peleliu. She was not thought to be hurt.

The Foreign Office was contacting the 
families to keep them informed yesterday. ‘We are aware of reports of a 
Briton missing in the Pacific Ocean. We stand ready to provide consular 
assistance,’ a spokesman said.

Mr Chandler said the rescue crews were
using a computer programme that checks wind and currents from the area 
the British sailor went missing, to estimate the direction and distance 
he was swept away from the boat.

He acknowledged there were sharks in the area, but said there was still hope of finding the man alive.

‘The water is warmer there than in 
some other areas we cover and the techniques we are using have been 
previously effective,’ he said.

The man had a light beacon on his life jacket, making it more likely he could be spotted.
