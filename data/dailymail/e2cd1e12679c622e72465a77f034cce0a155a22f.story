Manchester United's injury woes have continued with news that midfielder Ander Herrera will be out for up to a month with a fractured rib.

The Spanish international suffered the injury in the 2-1 defeat of West Ham at Old Trafford last Saturday to joined United's long injury list.

United manager Louis van Gaal could have as many as 10 players missing for this Sunday's home game with Everton even though the likes of Phil Jones and Michael Carrick are getting closer to fitness.

Herrera has been excellent for United since his summer arrival from Athletic Bilbao 

Nine United first-team players are out through injury or suspension. They are:

Ander Herrera, Jonny Evans, Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Michael Carrick, Marouane Fellaini, Ashley Young, Jesse Lingard and Wayne Rooney. 

With captain Wayne Rooney suspended, Darren Fletcher could start in the centre of the field while Juan Mata should move off the substitutes' bench.

Last night a United statement confirmed: 'Ander sustained a fractured rib during the match against West Ham. (He) was substituted in the 74th minute and the club will continue to monitor his progress over the next few weeks.'

Herrera himself tweeted: 'A real shame this injury, but now's not the time to feel sorry for myself. I'm already working to be back as soon as possible!'

A fractured rib usually takes up to four weeks to heal, though the recovery period can be as long as six weeks. With an international break looming after this weekend's fixtures in the Barclays Premier League, United hope Herrera will miss just three games – against Everton, West Brom and Chelsea – but the 25-year-old must be a doubt for the Manchester derby on November 2.

Herrera has scored twice for United this season, including in the 4-0 victory over QPR at Old Trafford
