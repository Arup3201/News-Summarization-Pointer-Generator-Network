Sipping cappuccinos by the pool of the striking Fasano hotel in Rio de Janeiro last summer, Rio Ferdinand couldn’t wait to get back to work. His voice was crackling with excitement.

It was there, during a break between matches at the World Cup in Brazil, when he admitted that the performances of Arjen Robben and James Rodriguez had whetted his appetite for the game once more.

Just three months have passed since he returned to start pre-season training with his new club QPR. He will be wondering whether it is all worth it. 

Rio Ferdinand is no longer a first choice at QPR after making a slow start to life after Manchester United

The former England captain had decided to continue his career despite leaving Old Trafford last summer

Nearly 36, Ferdinand is no longer first choice in the Rangers team and has just been banned by the FA for three games, fined £25,000 and ordered to attend an education course.

When he left Manchester United last season, he could have pursued a promising broadcasting career with BT and the BBC, or branched out into fashion and retail with his #5 clothing and magazine range.

Instead he wanted one more season on the field, driving into QPR’s rough and ready Harlington training ground each day from his enormous family home in Kent to smell the dressing-room atmosphere once again.

Ferdinand recently released another autobiography, #2sides, which included criticism of the management techniques used by David Moyes in his short spell as United manager.

A few days after its release, along with the subsequent publicity around the farrago over Moyes’ decision to ban chips, Ferdinand was in the QPR team beaten 4-0 at United.

Still, he was given a tremendous reception, with chants of ‘Rio, Rio’ ringing around the stands when he walked out with his new team just before kick-off. 

He won six Barclays Premier League titles, the Champions League and the World Club Cup during his glittering career at the Theatre of Dreams. This season has turned into a nightmare.

There are very few players who have left Old Trafford in the autumn of their careers and gone on to be a success at their next club. Most simply retire. 

When the legs went, Paul Scholes (twice), Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville, who all enjoyed stellar careers at United, went out at the very top.

Others, such as Roy Keane (Celtic), Denis Irwin (Wolves), Gary Pallister (Middlesbrough), and Brian McClair (Motherwell), had limited success after they were shown the door by Sir Alex Ferguson. 

Keane, in his recently-released book The Second Half, admits he should never have moved to Celtic Park after Ferguson kicked him out of Old Trafford in 2005. 

Ferdinand won 81 England caps, and was named captain by Fabio Capello before the 2010 World Cup

Few players have continued to achieve success after leaving Old Trafford and Ferdinand is struggling

Ferdinand’s great friend Frank Lampard, now 36, is enjoying a remarkable loan spell with Manchester City and was voted the fans' player of the month in September. 

No-one, though, really wants to admit that they are done with football at the very highest level. Ferdinand is the same. 

The former England international wanted to work with Harry Redknapp, the man who gave him his first-team debut at West Ham in 1996, for one more season before he called it quits. It has not gone so well.

He has been nailed by the FA this week, taken to the cleaners for using the word ‘sket’ — street-slang for a promiscuous woman — in a foolish exchange on Twitter. Ferdinand, a prominent and respected member of the football community, ought to have known better than to react, but Twitter is the wild west; provocation and abuse are rife.

He should be a statesman of the game, a beacon for every budding young player trying to make their way into professional football.

On Monday evening, when he sat on the substitutes’ bench for the second successive QPR match at Loftus Road, it was sad to see one of the game’s great players looking on.

It must have been a tough decision for Redknapp to leave him out of the team to face Liverpool, a game they lost 3-2, but Ferdinand accepted the decision. Naturally, he didn’t agree with it.

After QPR’s 2-0 victory over Aston Villa on Monday, Redknapp revealed that Ferdinand had admitted he had ‘never been so nervous during a game’ and was highly animated throughout. 

Redknapp went on to say that Ferdinand, who admitted in an interview with this newspaper in September that he wanted to become England’s head coach, will go on to become a top-class manager.

Ferdinand is a veteran of social media, and should have been able to ignore the provocation

That is all in the future, but the priority is to win back his place in the QPR team when his three-match suspension is over.

He has seven days to lodge an appeal over the punishment, but as it stands he will miss games against Chelsea (Saturday), Manchester City (November 8) and Newcastle (November 22).

There were days when Ferdinand, one of the great modern-day defenders, would relish the prospect of facing those three teams in a Manchester United shirt. 

Instead he will be sitting in the stands. After the career he’s had, this is no way to go out.

Having lost his place in the QPR starting line-up, Ferdinand has now been banned for three games
