Louis van Gaal may be irritated about Manchester United's exhausting pre-season programme, but the Dutchman can thank his lucky stars that he is no longer manager of Bayern Munich.

Van Gaal complained last week that his side's commercial responsibilities in touring the USA were 'not very positive preparation' for a Premier League season. But he may wish to spare a thought for some of his former charges.

Bayern Munich's tour of the USA looks set to be the most gruelling of the lot, with some of their players not even getting the chance to sleep on the tour.

World Cup winners Lahm, Muller, Gotze, Boateng and Neuer, along with semi-finalists Robben and Dante, will join the squad next Wednesday.

The club will play a friendly against Guadalajara, and finish with a fixture against the MLS All Stars.

The latter being the headline attraction of the tour, Bayern are not prepared to do without their big names, and have demanded that their World Cup stars return from holiday to spend just one day in the States.

That means that the likes of Lahm, Neuer and Robben face a nightmare 34 hour trip. Leaving Munich at 10am on Wednesday 6th August, they will be back in the city by 8pm the following day. The players will arrive in the US, play the match, and leave for Munich again without so much as an overnight stop.

Of all the World Cup latecomers, only Jerome Boateng has been spared the gruesome round trip, but only by virtue of the fact that he is already on holiday in the US.

With worries about Bayern's usually poor post-World Cup form, forcing an energy sapping trip such as this one on the players certainly seems rash. But just as van Gaal has found to his chagrin at United, the 'commercial activities' of a club come before the welfare of the players in pre-season.

For Bayern, this summer is a huge opportunity to try and break the American market. They are set to open a new offices in New York during the tour, and will be looking to capitalise on the World Cup success of the US national team under former Bayern player Jurgen Klinsmann. 

There has already been one setback for Bayern's PR machine, though, with chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge unable to take part in the tour, having been denied a visa. 

The US consulate in Germany has admitted that there is a „global problem“ with the visa system at the moment. Six of Bayern's youth players have also been affected, and are now unable to join the squad as planned.
