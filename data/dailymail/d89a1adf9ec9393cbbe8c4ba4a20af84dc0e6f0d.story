Criticism: Ed Miliband was branded a hypocrite last night after it emerged his party uses first-class travel for its elite

Ed Miliband was branded a hypocrite last night after it emerged his party uses  first-class travel for its elite.

The Labour leader’s officials admitted party general secretary Iain McNicol travelled first class by rail from London to the party’s conference in Manchester last month.

He is understood to have travelled on a £400 return ticket.

It also emerged that Mr Miliband’s favourite new policy guru – Harvard professor Michael Sandel – was flown over to the conference in business class from the US on a ticket estimated to have cost £5,000.

The revelations came after Labour mocked Chancellor George Osborne for travelling in first class on Friday night on a standard ticket on a train from Wilmslow to London.

Tory MP Andrew Bridgen seized on the revelations, saying: ‘This is first-class hypocrisy from Labour.

'They mock the Chancellor for travelling that way, then it emerges it’s the preferred mode of travel for Labour’s elite. We should be surprised but Labour’s bigwigs have never practised what they preach.’

Labour last night declined to confirm the cost of Prof Sandel’s flights or of Mr McNicol’s ticket.

A spokesman stressed that  Mr Miliband and his entourage had travelled to Manchester in ‘standard class’ but that Mr McNicol needed to go first class because he had a meeting and conference calls to make.

The spokesman denied charges of hypocrisy, saying the party had criticised Mr Osborne not for going first class but for having a standard ticket and sitting in a first-class carriage.

However, Shadow Minister Michael Dugher this weekend mocked the Chancellor, saying: ‘George Osborne obviously thinks it’s one rule for him and another for the plebs he’s so keen to sit apart from.’
