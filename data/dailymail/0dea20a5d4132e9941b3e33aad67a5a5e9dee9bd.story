Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers wants to send young Portuguese defender Tiago Ilori out on loan, with French club Bordeaux one likely destination.

The 21-year-old centre half was signed for £8m from Sporting Lisbon last summer but has not made an impact at Anfield.

Now Rodgers has managed to convince the Portuguese U20 international that it is in his best interests to go out on loan and get some football.

Surplus to requirements: Tiago Ilori hasn't made a senior appearance for Liverpool since signing last summer

Out on loan: Brendan Rodgers wants to send the former Sporting Lisbon defender (centre) on loan this season

The Portuguese defender has yet to feature for Liverpool’s first team and spent the second half of last season on loan in La Liga at Granada.

Bordeaux are the first club to show interest whose way in to the Liverpool first team is barred by the likes of Mamadou Sakho, Martin Skrtel and new signing from Southampton Dejan Lovren.

Meanwhile, another Liverpool defender Kolo Toure has turned down a proposed move to Trabsonspor in Turkey.

New arrival: Centre-back Dejan Lovren has arrived at Anfield for £20m  from Southampton this summer 

Staying put: Kolo Toure has refused a move to Turkish club Trabsonspor to fight for a place at Liverpool
