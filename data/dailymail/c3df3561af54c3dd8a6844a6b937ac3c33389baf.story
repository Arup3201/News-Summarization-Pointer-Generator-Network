Google's top lawyer has said the internet giant is 'concerned and outraged' at claims that the NSA has tapped into its private network.

David Drummond's comments came as newly leaked documents from Edward Snowden allegedly showed a sketch detailing how the NSA accessed Google using a new program known as MUSCULAR.

The sketch, published by the Washington Post, reportedly caused two Google engineers to 'explode into profanity' as it showed how to bypass security measures.

A few months ago Mr Drummond had said 'the government does not have access to Google servers - not directly, or via a back door,' according to Business Insider.

But, after the latest allegations, he released a statement that said: 'We are outraged at the lengths to which 
the government seems to have gone to intercept data from our private 
fiber networks, and it underscores the need for urgent reform.'

He said: 'We have long been concerned about the 
possibility of this kind of snooping, which is why we have continued to 
extend encryption across more and more Google services and links, 
especially the links in the slide.'

'We do not provide any government, 
including the U.S. government, with access to our systems,' he added.

The NSA's director, General Keith Alexander, denied the agency had illegally accessed internet companies' servers.

'This is not NSA breaking into any databases. It would be illegal for us to do that ... But I can tell you factually we do not have access to Google servers, Yahoo servers. We go through a court order,' he told CNN.

In a statement tweeted earlier in the day the NSA didn't deny the existence of MUSCULAR but insisted that it was not collecting 'vast quantities' of data on its citizens.

The NSA's principal tool to exploit 
the data links is a project called MUSCULAR, operated jointly with the 
agency's British counterpart, GCHQ.

The program uses an unnamed 
telecommunications provider giving secret access to a
 cable for Google and Yahoo to pass unencrypted traffic between their 
servers.

'NSA is a foreign intelligence agency. And we’re focused on discovering and developing intelligence about valid foreign intelligence targets only,' a NSA statement read, according to Business Insider.

The Washington Post had reported that the NSA sent millions of records from Yahoo and Google internal networks to data warehouses at the 
agency's Fort Meade, Maryland headquarters,every day.

The newspaper cited documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, which included a
 slide from an agency presentation 
entitled 'Google Cloud Exploitation'.

The slide featured a sketch showing where 
the 'Public Internet' meets the internal 'Google Cloud' of user data.

Denial: NSA director General Keith Alexander says the agency has not illegally accessed servers

On
 the sketch, a note added that encryption was 'added and remove here!' and
 the artist jotted a smiley face - in what the Post called a 'cheeky 
celebration of victory over Google security'.

'Two engineers with close ties to Google exploded in profanity when they saw the drawing,' the Post reported.

In the 30 days after January 9, field collectors were said to have processed and sent back more than 180 million new records - ranging 
from 'metadata', which would indicate who sent or received emails and 
when, to content such as text, audio and video.

Both companies said they had not given the NSA permission to do so and were not aware of the activity.

The Post said NSA and GCHQ were copying entire data flows across fiber-optic cables that carry information between the data centers of the Silicon Valley giants.

General Alexander said he NSA was not authorized to access data centers and had to go through a court process to obtain it.

The report comes despite the companies saying their servers are closely guarded and strictly audited. According to Google, buildings housing its servers are guarded around-the-clock and secured with heat-sensitive cameras and biometric verification.

In a statement to the Post, Google 
said it was 'troubled by allegations of the government intercepting 
traffic between our data centers, and we are not aware of this 
activity'.

At Yahoo a 
spokesman added: 'We have strict controls in place to protect the 
security of our data centers, and we have not given access to our data 
centers to the NSA or to any other government agency.'

White House officials and the Office of 
the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the NSA, declined 
to comment, the Post said.

Revelations: The information was obtained by former NSA contractor, Edward Snowden

The
 NSA already collects data from Google, Yahoo and other technology 
companies under another program known as PRISM - details of which were 
revealed by Snowden earlier this year.

The program legally compels the companies to provide the agency with information that matches court-approved search terms.

The collection of data by MUSCULAR would be illegal in the U.S, but the operations take place overseas, where the NSA can presume anyone using a foreign data link is a foreigner, the Post said.
