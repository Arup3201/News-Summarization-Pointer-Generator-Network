The entire crowd was loving Kanye West's concert in Melbourne on Tuesday night but not as much as one particular punter who was clearly having the best night of his life.

The concert goer's hypnotic dance moves were so entertaining that a fellow fan posted the hilarious footage on Instagram with the comment: 'Kanye was the second most entertaining thing at the concert.'

The diehard fan seemed to be in his own little world in the background of the video as Kanye was performing on stage at the Rod Laver Arena in a chained mask that he also wore at his two previous Australian gigs.

Kanye and his wife Kim Kardashian were spotted at Zambesi in Melbourne's CBD earlier in the day

The man was frantically thrashing his arms in the air - like he clearly just didn't care

The man was frantically thrashing his arms in the air - like he clearly just didn't care - as the rest of the crowd seemed to be too into the rapper's gig to even notice the fan's unique dance actions.

Kanye's wife Kim Kardashian was nowhere to be seen at the Melbourne gig - opting to enjoy the show from backstage - unlike her husband's first two concerts in Perth and Adelaide where she made showy appearances.  

Kanye and Kim mania has been in full swing since the rapper arrived in town with his wife for his Australian tour.

The glam couple stopped by the singer's Yeezus merchandise pop-up shop in Melbourne earlier in the day before the gig.  

Kim will be making an appearance at Westfield Parramatta shopping centre in Sydneys' west on Saturday.
