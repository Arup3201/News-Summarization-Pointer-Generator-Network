Seth Meyers kicked things off with his
 new job as host of Late Night on Monday with the help of Vice President Joe Biden, who skillfully laughed off questions about his designs on the White House.

Myers asked Biden about his 2016 intentions while comedian Amy Poehler stood gamely by to help break in the stage with her fellow Saturday Night Live alum.

'Well you know I was planning on making a major announcement tonight,' said the vice president in reply, 'but I decided tonight is your night.'

'Well you know I was planning on making a major announcement tonight,' the vice president joked to newly minted Late Night host Seth Meyers. 'But I decided tonight is your night.'

As he explained to Meyers, ‘So I hope you'll
 invite me back.’

Meyers
 takes over for new Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon and managed to get 
through the opening-night butterflies with practiced ease and charm.

His debut was the final piece in a late night shakeup at NBC in the wake of host Jay Leno's retirement.

When Biden arrived to join first guest Poehler, it made for a cozy trio. After all, Biden and Poehler have a history of their own, reaching back to his cameo appearance last season on her NBC sitcom ‘Parks and Recreation.’

‘Amy really helped me with the Secret Service,’ said Biden, who reported that when he had finished shooting his ‘Parks and Recreation’ scene and was making his departure, the smitten Poehler grabbed a Secret Service agent by the lapels and demanded, ‘You take care of him!’

Poehler joked that she and Biden now 
plan to make a film together called ‘Snakes on a Train.’ Then she 
declared that she was running for president in two years.

The
 premiere of ‘Late Night with Seth Myers’ (which taped Monday evening 
for airing at 12:35 a.m. EST/11:35 p.m. CST), represented the final step
 in NBC's talk-show turnover.

Meyers,
 who until early this month was an ‘SNL’ veteran and co-anchor of its 
‘Weekend Update’ newscast, is filling the vacancy left by Jimmy Fallon 
after five years as ‘Late Night’ host.

Big night: Biden's faux announcement came on Meyers' first ever episode of Late Night, which was taped Monday and scheduled to air after the Tonight Show with its new host Jimmy Fallon

Fallon, of course, moved up last week to be host of ‘The Tonight Show,’ replacing Jay Leno.

So far, the late-night changes are paying off. Riding the crest of NBC's Olympics coverage, ‘The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon’ was seen by an average of 8.5 million viewers in its first week, the biggest ‘Tonight’ audience in decades.

Can the 40-year-old Meyers make the most of this popular lead-in?

He comes to his new role as a talk-show host with demonstrated skill and appeal from his years as an ‘SNL’ writer and performer.

He is known as a TV star who doesn't hog the spotlight and enjoys playing the straight man. He is also known as cerebral, which, if not moderated, could work against him: One of his monologue jokes hinged on the viewer knowing who Doris Kearns Goodwin is. It wasn't very funny either. And flopped.

Other jokes were more successful, even if they were larded by Meyers' insistent pause-and-grin pacing.

Shift change: Meyers was tapped as part of the shift change on NBC late night talk shows. With Jay Leno leaving the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon took his palce, thus leaving the Late Night desk open for the Saturday Night Live alum

He announced that the brassiere turns 100 years old this week — ‘and so does everyone who still calls it a brassiere.’

He noted that the Arizona Legislature passed a bill that would allow business owners asserting their religious beliefs to deny service to gay customers: ‘Some businesses have already put up signs that read, 'Nice shirt, nice shoes, no service.'‘

Later, he took another swing at Arizona during what may emerge as a durable humor franchise: Venn diagrams displaying what two seemingly different things have in common. One example: The intersection of Russia and the NBA was revealed to be ‘Places That are More Gay-Friendly than Arizona.’

The setting for Meyers' ‘Late Night’ is a sleek, art deco design. Sliding screens substitute for curtains.

As with most other talk shows, Meyers' format provides for a musical guest. On his first night, it was the band A Great Big World.

Speaking of music, a valuable asset is the leader of Meyers' house band, Fred Armisen, himself a musician as well as a comedian-performer — and clearly a funny sidekick. During a brief exchange, Meyers, playing the able straight man, questioned Armisen on one of his many projects, a new series on the History channel.

‘It's called 'Recent History,'‘ said Armisen, deadpan. ‘It only goes back the past hour or so, but it has an historical spin. Very serious. Very dry.’

One other feature that seems to have potential: Meyers' skill at relating a story. From his desk, he told a charming anecdote about an outing with his wife that went awry. With apparent effortlessness, he brought the tale to a finish by observing, ‘It's hard to feel macho when you're holding a tiny dog and another man is changing your wife's tire.’
