Caught: Miguel Mejias-Ramos, 28, allegedly stabbed his wife and children to death on Sunday

A husband suspected of brutally stabbing his young wife and their two daughters to death as they got ready for church has been caught by police trying to flee to Mexico.

Miguel Mejias-Ramos, 28, was stopped by U.S. Marshals just before midnight driving a car with New York State license plates and attempting to get into Mexico, where he was born, police sources said.

His arrest came a day after he allegedly murdered his wife Deisy Garcia, 21, and their two daughters, two-year-old Daniela Mejia and one-year-old Yaslin Mejia, at their home in Queens, New York.

Police named her husband as a person of interest, and on Monday he was caught heading for the border. He was found with minor wounds and taken to hospital, the New York Post reported.

Garcia's uncle stumbled upon the gruesome scene at around 7pm on Sunday.

All three had suffered multiple stab wounds and sources said that two bloody knives were left in the two rooms where the bodies were found.

A friend, Diana Villa, told the Post that Garcia had been petrified of Ramos and had even asked their local pastor for help - but that she was scared of calling police because she was an illegal immigrant from Guatemala.

Killed: Deisy Garcia, 21, was stabbed alongside her daughters, aged one and two, in their Queens home on Jan 18

Loved: Deisy Garcia's friends described her as quiet but happy, and a good mother to her young daughters

Villa said she had witnessed a violent
 fight between the couple at a recent baby shower after Ramos blamed her
 for having no beer at the party, which was at the church.

Police officers had visited the residence
 for domestic violence complaints against Ramos last November and May, 
but he was not arrested on either occasion.

Garcia’s
 uncle Ramon Chuc, 37, recalled discovering the bodies with his two 
sons, ages 12 and 10, after they returned to the home after playing 
football outside.

'My 
12-year-old son, Rene, went inside the room and saw my niece on the 
floor,' Chuc sobbed. 'After that, I... saw the two babies are covered 
with a blanket. I take it off and see them.'

Scene: Garcia's uncle came across the bodies at their Queens, New York home in January

Fears: Neighbors said that couple fought and police had responded to domestic violence complaints before

Investigation: The home, which is above a drug store, was cordoned off on Sunday night after the discovery

All three were pronounced dead at the scene with stab wounds to the chest.

The apartment, which is above a drug store, was cordoned off by police.

People who knew the victim from church say that Garcia had previously been married but they didn’t see the father around much.

‘She was a quiet but happy person. She always had a smile on her face. She was a good mom,’ Mario Sanchez, 16, told the Daily News.
