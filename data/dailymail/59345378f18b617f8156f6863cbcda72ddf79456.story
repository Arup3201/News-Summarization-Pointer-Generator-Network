An historic property which once belonged to an inventor who helped design the diving bell has gone on the market for £1.5million.

Willmead in Bovey Tracey, Devon was once home to the Reverend William Davy who was instrumental in the development of the underwater contraption - the forerunner of today's submarine.

Rev Davy invented key components of the diving bell as part of moves to raise the guns and other lost property from shipwrecks such as the  Royal George, which sank near Portsmouth in 1782.

Although his was not the first diving bell, his improvements to the air supply improved the design.

As a boy Rev Davy watched the construction of a Devon mill, which he replicated in a wooden model, with working parts.

When the mill workmen encountered a difficulty and the mill stopped, it was the eight-year-old William who was able to point out the defect and get the machinery working again.

After being educated at Exeter Grammar School and Balliol College, Oxford, he embarked on a major project on the origin of the Christian Faith.

His 12 volume work, A General System of Theology, was to be one of his major life’s works.

In fact he was such a prolific author that it was a practical measure to build his own printing press.

He married Sarah Gilbert of Longabrook near Kingsbridge.

When he lived at Willmead, he also concentrated his energies on the gardens (pictured), moving granite boulders, arranging terraces among the rocks, and forming an exotic herbacious garden

The house is for sale with Strutt & Parker for £1.5 million.
