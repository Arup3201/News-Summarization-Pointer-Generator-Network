A man outside a McDonald's was struck by a driver who collected his food from the drive-thru before taking off, local media reported over the weekend.

The incident took place Saturday outside a Laurelton, Queens, McDonald's at 4:55am, The New York Daily News reported.

The wounded man was in the drive-thru lane and hit after he had already dropped to the ground, according the newspaper.

Witness and restaurant manager Jonathan Brown told The New York Daily News 'The guy, I think he was drunk, was in the drive-thru leaning on a car randomly.'

'Then he fell and I thought he was dead so I went to call the cops,' he continued. 'Thirty seconds later a car came and just hit him.'

Brown also told the newspaper 'I’m traumatized. [The driver] ran over his head and the guy was trying to get up with the car still on top of him!'

He also relayed to The New York Daily News that 'The car just backed up and drove around him and picked up his food.'

The incident was not witnessed by the other McDonald's workers and there wasn't enough time for Brown to inform them, the newspaper reported.

Police told the newspaper the 48-year-old victim was transported to Jamaica Hospital and is in critical but stable condition.

The New York Post reported Sunday that the driver was behind the wheel of a Nissan Altima, and that he hasn't been found yet.
