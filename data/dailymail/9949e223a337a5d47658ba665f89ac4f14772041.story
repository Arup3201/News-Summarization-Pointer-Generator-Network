Luis Suarez has been named as one of 29 players in a preliminary Uruguay squad for two friendlies against Saudi Arabia and Oman next month.

Coach Oscar Tabarez still has to decide decide if he will pick the Barcelona forward for the matches on Oct. 10 in Saudi Arabia, and three days later in Oman.

The former Liverpool striker is banned from Uruguay's next eight competitive matches for biting an opponent during the World Cup, meaning he will miss next year's Copa America and several of their World Cup qualifiers.

Tabarez declined to call up Suarez for two friendlies this month against Japan and South Korea. Uruguay won both.

The ban also covers competitive matches for Barcelona for another month, although the 27-year-old did score twice for Barcelona B in a friendly against Indonesia Under 19s on Wednesday as the countdown to his return begins.

One month today he will face Real Madrid in the Bernabeu and in his first full 90 minutes since the World Cup.
