Manchester United star Angel di Maria asked for too much money to stay at Real Madrid, according to Carlo Ancelotti.

The Bernabeu boss revealed the club refused to break the wage structure to keep the Argentine, who moved to Old Trafford in a £60million deal this summer.

Di Maria has hit the ground running for Louis van Gaal's side with three Premier League goals in five matches.

But Real boss Ancelotti believes the club's principles were more important than keeping Di Maria in an attacking line-up already host to Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and James Rodriguez.

'I was in agreement with the club,' Ancelotti told Cadena COPE.

'There are times when the club needs to say no. You can’t change the policies of the club for one player.

'Di Maria asked for a lot of money and preferred to leave to go find it. The club couldn’t give him the money he wanted.

The former Chelsea manager also spoke about the departures of Xabi Alonso and Diego Lopez 

'They say that I’m the manager of the club; of course, I coach for the club, not for the players.'

The former Chelsea manager also revealed the reasons behind other summer departures from the Bernabeu, including Bayern Munich midfielder Xabi Alonso.

Ancelotti said: 'Xabi is different because he asked to leave. He was a little tired and because of the respect we have for him, we let him leave because we had good options with (Toni) Kroos and James (Rodriguez). He didn’t betray us.

'Diego Lopez left to find another great club with less competition. He left because he preferred to leave, no one ever asked for him to leave.'
