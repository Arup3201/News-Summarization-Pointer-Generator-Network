A Romanian crime gang who went on a £120,000 theft spree were today jailed for a total of 22 years.

The five men struck a total of 14 times in three months in the Ribble Valley area of Lancashire, stealing power cables at rural beauty spots at locations including electricity substations and farms.

Police said the gang put their own safety at risk by stealing the live cables, which can carry up to 765,000 volts, as well as putting at risk the homes of the people served by the power lines.

Gang members: Gabriel Predusca (left), 24, and Alexandru Beligan (right), 28, both admitted conspiracy to steal

Thefts: Marius Avram (left), 48 and Mahai Georgian Antonala (right), 28, were also in the Romanian gang

They went out in the dead of night and, after climbing electricity pylons, used professional ‘jumpers’ to isolate the power so they could handle and steal the copper cables.

When arrested the gang had hundreds of feet of copper wiring, weighing over a tonne, in the back of a van. Also seized by police were boots adapted with a large spiked hook to aid climbing up poles.

Thefts took place at the Ribble Valley rural sites of Clitheroe, Ribchester, Sabden, Dinckley, Hurst Green and Whalley. The cabling itself was worth £28,000 and the cost of restoring it was £90,000.

In one raid, the gang, who had planned and were prepared for the stealing expeditions, caused an electrical flash when they were trying to steal cable from Clitheroe, and left empty- handed.

They were caught in the early hours of July 3 last year, within hours of taking cables from Dinckley and Sabden, when stopped in a convoy of two vehicles travelling south on the M6 in Staffordshire.

In the lead car were four of the defendants with ‘incriminating’ documentation, addresses and postcodes of sites where cables had been stolen. In the following van was a haul of copper.

The gang members - Alexandru Codrut Tudor, 21, Mahai Georgian Antonala, 28, Alexandru Beligan, 28, Marius Avaram, 48, and Gabriel Predusca, 24, all from Birmingham, admitted conspiracy to steal.

Antonala also pleaded guilty to disqualified driving and was banned for three years. Tudor was ordered off the road for two years. Beligan, described by a judge as the ‘driving force’ behind the plot, was jailed for six years.

'People are entitled to expect that those who did as you did will receive immediate, substantial, prison sentences'

Judge Graham Knowles QC

Antonala got four and a half years, Tudor and Avaram were each given four years and two months and Predusca received 44 months. All had been allowed legally allowed into the UK.

Mark Lamberty, prosecuting, told Burnley Crown Court that between March 29 and July 3 last year, there were 14 recorded thefts of copper cabling from locations in the Ribble Valley. They took place on four main occasions - March 29, mid-May, mid-June and on the night of 2 and 3 July.

Mr Lamberty said on July 3, at a farm in Sabden, there was some indication of technical knowledge in that ‘jumpers’ had been cut in a manner so as to isolate a section of wire for safe removal.

The prosecutor said at 3.30am, on May 22, a witness whose home overlooked a car park in the centre of Ribchester awoke, saw a small van, got his binoculars and noted the number.

Aiding theft: Also seized by police were boots adapted with a large spiked hook to aid climbing up poles

On that night, cable had been stolen from Gallows Lane, near the centre. On July 3, a three-year-old boy in Dinckley woke his young mother at 2.30am, upset his bedroom light had gone out.

That night there were two thefts of cable from the area. Mr Lamberty said police stopped two vehicles on July 3, at 5.20am. The driver of the first vehicle was Antonala, who was banned.

He gave a false name. Avaram was the front seat passenger and he had two mobile phones on him. When he was searched in custody, officers found a piece of paper in his pocket with addresses in the Ribble Valley on it.

At the farm in Sabden, there were marks on the poles, indicative of the use of equipment to scale up them.

Also found in the car were boots with metal attachments which an electricity representative was able to identify as similar to pole climbing equipment. Police found postcodes entered by the gang on Google Maps were found to be in roads where overhead cabling was present.

Sentencing, Judge Graham Knowles QC, ordered that the gang's car be seized.

In the van: The gang went out in the dead of night and, after climbing electricity pylons, used professional 'jumpers' to isolate the power so they could handle and steal the copper cables

He told the gang: ‘This type of crime is prevalent across the nation, the conspiracy was successful and professional and you believed you would profit handsomely from it. It caused inconvenience and could potentially have put safety at risk.

‘People are entitled to expect that those
who did as you did will receive immediate, substantial, prison 
sentences, to make plain the seriousness of the offence and to act as a 
deterrent to others who may be tempted to steal in the same way.’

'These thefts left hundreds of homes without power and were highly dangerous'

Detective Sergeant Kathryn Cussans

After the case Detective Sergeant Kathryn Cussans of Lancashire Police said: ‘These thefts left hundreds of homes without power and were highly dangerous.

‘By cutting into copper wiring, thieves are not only putting themselves at risk but they are risking the lives of the residents whose homes are connected to the power supply. I hope today's sentence sends out a strong message that this type of behaviour will not be tolerated.’

Lee Maxwell, Lancashire area manager at Electricity North West, added: ‘These five men had stolen overhead power lines and caused major disruption to our customers.

‘Although the men have been successfully sentenced we still have a long struggle ahead as we receive reports of metal theft every day across the region.

‘This causes thousands of pounds worth of damage and affects livelihoods, critical health services and also vulnerable people, including the elderly.’
