Nottingham Forest last night provided a boost after the turmoil between boss Stuart Pearce and owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi by breaking their transfer record and signing two players for a combined £6.5million.

Striker Britt Assombalonga joined from Peterborough for a fee of £5m to top the 1997 capture of Pierre van Hooijdonk, while Sheffield Wednesday winger Michail Antonio arrived for £1.5m.

But another note of concern emerged with key player Henri Lansbury set to leave for Burnley with the clubs negotiating a fee of around £3.5m.

Lansbury’s exit is believed to be another deal that initially progressed without Pearce’s full knowledge. The manager was angered by sales of Jamaal Lascelles and Karl Darlow to Newcastle behind his back, before Lansbury told the 52-year-old last week about his desire for Premier League football.

Al-Hasawi had challenged Lansbury, 23, to sign the new contract first offered in February but it is understood the terms are significantly less than certain team-mates and he will not be putting pen to paper.

Burnley boss Sean Dyche is keen on the midfielder, who has scored 12 goals in 53 starts since moving to the City Ground from Arsenal for £1m in 2012, and would offer regular game time.
