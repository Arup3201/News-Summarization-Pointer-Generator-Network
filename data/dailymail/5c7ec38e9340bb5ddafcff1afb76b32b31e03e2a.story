She is the reality TV star and daughter of Arcadia tycoon Sir Philip Green who has branched out in a design career of her own. And now Chloe Jade Green's rise to fame as fashion designer is heading for new heights with a promising new collection for autumn/winter 2012.

Chloe, 21, has expanded her range, which was previously only heels, to feature scarves, fashion-forward jewellery, flat shoes and boots. Those heels are still sky high though...

Speaking at the launch of the collection last night, she said: '[It] introduces a rocky edge, mixing up textures of mesh panelling and intricate laser cutwork.'

'The 15-piece collection sees the introduction of the signature charm print etched onto the jade green soles.

'In addition the range has been 
extended to jewellery with coordinating designs, contrasting delicate 
chains with leather, spikes and tough utility pieces.'

A twist on the signature Louboutin 
red sole (and a reference to her famous surname), the bottom of Green's 
are all a shade of green.

While
in previous seasons Green's heels have been pointy stilettos, this season she's 
gone for a more trend-focused chunky version for AW12, all of which feature a 
pretty botanical graphic on the soles.

At the launch last night, to which various members of the press were invited, Chloe wore a black lace maxi dress with studded leather sleeveless biker jacket - and chunky biker boots from her own collection.

Unlike her usual star-studded launches this was a low-key event with neither her famous father nor celebrities in attendance.

CJG is available exclusively on www.topshop.com and in Selfridge's, with prices ranging from £75 to £195 for shoes and boots, £75 for scarves and £25 to £60 for jewellery.

The designs of the shoes are at once pretty and urban, which is a good place for Chloe to be. The collection as a whole seems to be more 
perceptive of her target market of girls in their late teens.

A far cry from the glittering, metallic
and neon creations in her first collection, these more sophisticated designs are refreshing. 

The heights of some of the platform heels we love are still eye-watering though, to the point of wondering how dangerous it is to walk in them, which is a shame.

The scarves are feminine yet edgy with great screen prints and lovely muted colours that would go well in any pretty goth's closet.

The jewellery is also outstanding. We love the spiked cuff bracelet and the collar-like necklaces - both of which would complement a lot of what's already in our wardrobe.

VERDICT: She's on the right track.
