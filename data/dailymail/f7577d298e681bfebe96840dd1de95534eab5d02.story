Chatroulette has exploded in popularity over the few years, and now it seems the social networking concept has extended even into the realms of drug taking.

PuffPuffChat is a website where people high on marijuana can talk to each other, while rating how high they are on a scale from 0 to 10.

Following in the footsteps of other chat sites, PuffPuffChat connects two strangers and enables them to chat - albeit with that one obvious difference.

Smoking cannabis even casually can damage core structures of the brain, an authoritative study has found.

Just using the drug once or twice a week affects the  size and shape of two key  brain regions involved in emotion and motivation, the research shows.

Previous studies have focused on heavy users of cannabis - revealing that the active compound in the drug effectively ‘rewires’ the brain.

But this is the first study that has revealed the impact of casual marijuana use.

The scientists, from Harvard Medical School and Northwestern University in Chicago, analysed MRI brain scans of 20 young cannabis users aged 18 to 25.

They compared them to the brain scans 20 young people who never smoked the drug.

Professor Hans Breiter, one of the researchers from Northwestern University said: ‘This study raises a strong challenge to the idea that casual marijuana use  is not associated with bad consequences.’

When users first log onto the website they are asked ‘How high are you?’

Once a number is selected, the user is then taken into a chat window with a random other user.

While their name is anonymous, how high they are is revealed next to their name.

Users can also use a webcam to have a video chat with others.

'Quite predictably, I was inspired to create PuffPuffChat whilst under the influence of marijuana,' the site's creator, Eric, told  MailOnline via email.

'So far the feedback has been very positive and heartwarming.

'Many people have reported having all kinds of fun conversations, some merely amusing, some truly inspiring.

'A surprising amount of favourable feedback, however, specifically refers to perhaps the silliest feature of the site - the see-through clouds at the top portion of the page.

'Those flee upon contact with the mouse cursor, and have reportedly been the source of cumulative hours of entertainment.'

Public Health England has warned people on the dangers of smoking cannabis. 'Based on evidence from across Europe, we know that stronger strains of cannabis may well be causing more problems,' a spokesperson for told MailOnline. Pictured is a marijuana plant in Colorado, U.S.

The designers assured MailOnline the site was not a hoax.

Drug charities and the Home Office, however, have expressed concern at the site - especially considering cannabis is illegal in the UK and most parts of the U.S. - and warned users of the dangers of the drug.

'Based on evidence from across Europe, we know that stronger strains of cannabis may well be causing more problems,' a spokesperson for Public Health England told MailOnline.

'Our figures show that more and more people are using specialist drug services to get help for cannabis use, even though the overall trend is falling.

'This increase is likely to be due to a greater awareness of the risks and problems caused by cannabis by both people using the drug and health professionals referring people on to services.'

A spokesperson for the Home Office added: 'Our position is clear: cannabis is controlled as a class B drug. Suggesting that people should be discouraged from smoking and using the site is an operational matter for the police.'
