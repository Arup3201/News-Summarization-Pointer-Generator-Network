Over the past two years 357 children in the UK were urged to carry out sexual acts live over the internet

Children as young as eight are being targeted online by foreign paedophile gangs who believe that Britain’s ‘liberal’ values make them easy prey.

Britain has become the top target for cyber sexual predators, a report reveals today.

The criminals trick victims into thinking they are talking to a boy or girl the same age.

They then persuade them to send compromising pictures or perform ‘slave-like sex acts’ live on webcams – before threatening to show the pictures to their families or friends or post them on the internet.

Investigators believe youngsters in this country are being exploited more than in any other nation due to offenders’ perceptions that British teenagers are more promiscuous.

The gangs also believe British parents impose fewer boundaries due to our ‘free, open and liberal society’, the report says.

Over the past two years 357 children in the UK were urged to carry out sexual acts live over the internet after being duped by criminal gangs posing as youngsters the same age as them.

This represents almost half of the 716 known victims worldwide, according to the figures published by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre.

Of those, 184 in the UK were blackmailed over a long period and forced to carry out ever more sickening sexual acts by the offenders who threatened to share obscene images of the victim with their friends and family unless victims complied with their demands.

Britain is now the top destination for cyber sex predators due to liberal parenting and perceptions of promiscuous children

In some cases, teenagers were forced to hand over money or even cut themselves live on web cams to satisfy their attacker’s demands. The abuse led to a number of children self harming and seven committing suicide, one of whom was British.

Daniel Perry, 17, killed himself earlier this year after being blackmailed over embarrassing images he posted online.

He thought he was talking to a pretty girl his own age from Illinois in the US.

But the apprentice mechanic had been targeted by a gang who tried to blackmail him by securing compromising images following months of flirting via Skype.

The gang revealed themselves in a menacing call via Skype. They threatened to show the images to his family unless he paid over some cash.

When Daniel asked: ‘What can I do to stop you showing this to my family?’ they said he would be ‘better off dead’ if he failed to pay.

He replied simply ‘Bye’ and less than an hour later jumped off the Forth Road Bridge in Scotland. He died in hospital on July 15.

His mother Nicola, from Dunfermline, Fife, said: ‘They are clever people and he was just scared and didn’t know what to do.

'Parents need to tell their children that nothing is that bad that it is worth taking your life over.’

Daniel Perry, 17, from Dunfermline in Fife, leapt to his death from the Forth Road Bridge in Scotland in July this year less than an hour after a gang told him he would be ‘better off dead’ if he did not follow their orders.

Another seven victims seriously self-harmed, of whom six were from the UK, CEOP said.

Experts said the paedophiles saw Britain as an easy target. Stephanie McCourt of CEOP said: ‘First of all it’s the English language.

‘They are able to threaten the children if they can communicate with them. English is a really popular universal language.

‘Second, the offenders have actually said that because they perceive the UK as a very free and liberal society, they think that they will have more success in targeting UK children.’

Investigators have warned that abusers’ methods are becoming more sophisticated with many researching the homes and schools of their targets using tools such as Google Maps.

They also glean information on friends and family from social networking sites before creating fake online personas.

Their victims, some as young as eight, are initially targeted on open chat sites and social networks before being directed to more private web sites.

In one case, an offender collated images of his victims in a folder named ‘slaves’.

CEOP has been involved in 12 blackmail investigations in the past two years, and in each case arrests were made less than a week after receiving a report of abuse.

The abusers came from four different continents, and in five cases the criminals were based in the UK.

The biggest case, code-named Operation K, involved 322 children who were blackmailed around the world, including 96 in the UK.

They were targeted by a gang from a non-European country who are due to stand trial in the coming weeks. Clinical psychologist Elly Farmer said: ‘We are seeing pure sadism and desire for power and control.’

CEOP chief executive Peter Davies urged parents to talk to their children about their online lives.

He said: ‘You might ask your son or daughter where they’re going at the weekend, why not do the same about what they are up to on their computer or mobile phone?’

Scotland Yard has seen an explosion in cases of online bullying and ‘Twitter trolling’. The number of offences reported to the Met leapt by 1,500 compared to last year, Deputy Commissioner Craig Mackey said.

Dr Miranda Hovarth has found that exposure to pornography makes teenage boys more likely to view women as objects, engage in risky behaviour, and have sex earlier

'I
was about 12 and this person started talking to me on the internet and 
said he was around my age.

'He'd
steer the conversation in a way where it was turning a bit dirty, then 
he'd start asking for other types of pictures as well. If you try and 
say "oh I don't want to talk about that' or 'whatever", he'd threaten or
blackmail me, saying that he'd send my dad all the chat logs if I 
didn't do what he said. I just thought you wouldn't blackmail someone 
you're supposed to be in love with so I just told him to shut up and 
sent him a couple more photos but he started to do that every week.

'My
teacher said I'd been acting depressed and they sorted me out with 
counselling. I'd started to self harm as well because everything just 
came together at the same time, and I was really upset and just needed a
release.

'Luckily I'm a
fairly strong person and I can get over things - I've learned to just 
push them away. But what if it was someone who wasn't, who was a 
weaker-minded person than me, what would have happened? They might have 
committed suicide or something, and it wouldn't have even been their 
fault - it would be because people weren't there for them.'

Teenage girls will welcome David Cameron’s plans for online porn filters because they are sick of seeing it, according to an expert who has studied the effect of web porn on young people.

Dr Miranda Horvath, a psychologist at Middlesex University, said many girls were exposed to explicit content against their will on social networking sites.

She suggested the Government could go further, perhaps bringing in the German system under which adults can only access online porn by signing a form at their post office.

This would ensure children would be protected from hardcore images, while over-18s.

Dr Horvath said blocking unsuitable content could change the ‘sexualised wallpaper’ of young people’s lives.

She was the lead author of a report for the Children’s Commissioner earlier this year, which assessed 30 years of research.

It found that porn can lead to boys viewing girls as sex objects, indulging in risky sexual behaviour and having sex earlier.

Mr Cameron has promised that all homes will be asked to decide whether they wanted to impose a filter, with ‘yes’ as the default option.

Dr Horvath said that although it might not be possible to ‘stamp it out completely’ but we should ‘provide people with the option’.
