David Cameron has ordered Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond to visit every European country before the election to build support for major reform of Brussels.

The Prime Minister, who is to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel next week, wants Mr Hammond to hold talks with every member state to set out Tory demands for change.

Mr Hammond has so far crossed off top-level talks with 13 countries in 11 capital cities but has barely 80 days left until the general election is called at the end of March to build an alliance in support of clawing powers back from Brussels.

Prime Minister David Cameron made clear to Mr Hammond that he expects him to visit every EU country before the election on May 7

Mr Cameron has promised that if he is still Prime Minister after the election he will renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU before holding an in-out referendum by 2017.

He used a major in November to set out key demands on banning EU nationals from claiming in-work benefits or social housing in Britain for four years, deporting jobless migrants if they do not get work for six months and refusing to allow other countries to join the EU without imposing controls on the movement of their workers until their economies have reached UK levels.

The PM made clear he plans to form alliances with leaders in central and eastern Europe who have lost their 'brightest and best' to Britain.

When Mr Hammond was appointed as Foreign Secretary in July he was told by Mr Cameron to travel to every EU country to the Tory reform plans and to discuss 'shared issues'.

His tour began in in July and has so far covered 11 countries, including meetings with 13 leaders.

It is understood that Mr Hammond will visit at least two more countries in the first week of January, before entering a 'new phase' of engagement with MEPs from across the continent.

The general election will take place on May 7, with Parliament due to be dissolved on March 30.

Mr Cameron will welcome German Chancellor Angela Merkel to Downing Street on Wednesday for talks on Europe

German chancellor Angela Merkel will visit the UK for talks with David Cameron next week.

The crisis in Ukraine crisis and the European economy are expected to be high on the agenda.

But Mr Cameron's plans for reform of the EU will also feature, with all eyes on securing German support for change. 

Mrs Merkel, who is travelling to London on Wednesday, will also visit the British Museum's Germany: Memories Of A Nation exhibition tracing 600 years of the country's history.

German government spokesman Georg Streiter said: 'Federal Chancellor Merkel will speak on bilateral, European political and international questions with Prime Minister Cameron.' 

A Foreign Office source said: 'The Foreign Secretary has been visiting EU partners to explain our reform plans and is cautiously optimistic about the discussions he has had so far.

'These initial visits have produced positive reactions, and come ahead of formal negotiations which are set to start after the General Election.

'It's clear that this isn't just about the UK's needs, many other countries have been expressing their interest in EU reform.'

He has already been to Berlin, Paris, Copenhagen, Vienna, Bratislava, Stockholm, The Hague, Rome, Riga, Dublin and Warsaw.

While in Bratislava Mr Hammond held talks with his Hungarian and Czech counterparts.

The biggest success of the tour to date came during a meeting in Berlin with German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Wolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister.

Mr Schäuble is said to have told Mr Hammond that he would 'never let Britain leave' the EU while Mr Steinmeier said 'it is vital' that the UK remains a member.

Visiting Dublin in December, Mr Hammond declared: 'I look forward to working with the Irish Government on much needed reforms in Europe that benefit all states and drive forward economic growth for everyone.'

And meeting French foreign minister Laurent Fabius in Paris in September, he discussed 'reform and renewal of the European Union following the appointment of the new Commission'.

Mr Hammond was in Paris in September, where he attended an international conference on tackling the threat posed by ISIS extremists

The source added: 'We're also watching the early stages of the new European Commission's reform agenda, to date there have been encouraging signs.

'A new phase is expected to start in the New Year with further engagement amongst Members of the European Parliament.'

However, Mr Cameron's demands for reform have not be universally welcomed across Europe.

His threat to block new members joining the EU unless movement limits remain in place until their economy matches Britain's led to him being branded a blackmailer by senior German figures.

And Poland has warned it could t it will veto attempts to curb benefits paid to EU migrants in Britain. 

FOR WORKERS FROM THE EU:

No in-work benefits until they have been in Britain for four years

No social housing for four years

No child benefit or tax credits paid for children living outside the UK

FOR UNEMPLOYED EU MIGRANTS:

No support from the UK taxpayer

Deportation if they do not get a job for six months

Other measures include:

Impose restrictions on EU migrants bringing in family members from outside the EU

Longer bans on rough sleepers, beggars and fraudsters returning to the UK

Tougher rules on deporting foriegn criminals

Refusing to allow other countries to join the EU without imposing controls on the movement of their workers until their economies have reached UK levels
