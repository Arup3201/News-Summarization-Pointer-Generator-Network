Playing computer games such as Angry Birds teaches children important life skills including concentration, resilience and problem solving, an academic has said.

Professor Angela Mcfarlane, an education expert who will become head of training body the College of Teachers next month, said many games were complex and required deep learning and lateral thinking to solve them.

Prof Mcfarlane said she herself had become 'hooked' on the Lemmings computer game, as well as Angry Birds, and said such games could have a place in the classroom provided they were used under supervision.

Expert: Prof Mcfarlane says the games can help children learn problem solving, resilience and concentration

She said: 'There are many computer games that require quite deep learning to master the games.

'Some of that learning applies beyond games to wider life, such as concentration, problem solving, and resilience - important life skills.

'Anyone who has tried to play complex video games will know they are difficult.'

Speaking to The Times, Prof Mcfarlane said she had developed an obsession with both Angry Birds and a precursor, Lemmings, because they had made her think and get her strategy right.

The education expert, who has advised the government on educational technology, and who is currently writing a book, Authentic Learning for the Digital Generation, said computer games could be used in the classroom to good effect provided it was done properly.

Prof Mcfarlane said even pre-school children could benefit from games, as long as they were supervised and not just given a phone to play with to keep them quiet.

She said some games could teach children fine motor control, or help with vocabulary or simple maths, and taught skills such as resilience that could be applicable to real life.

Next month Prof Mcfarlane, who began her career as a secondary school teacher and head of department, will become chief executive and registrar of the College of Teachers, which offers professional training to teachers and support staff.
