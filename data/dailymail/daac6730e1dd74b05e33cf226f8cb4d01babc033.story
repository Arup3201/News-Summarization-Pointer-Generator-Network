Naked: Inga Swanson was shot dead by two off-duty police officers on Saturday after she confronted them at a party

The naked woman shot dead by two off-duty police officers in Florida 10 days ago has been remembered by friends and family as modest, caring and very religious.

Inda Marie Swanson was generous and kind, according to those who knew her, taking candy to her Bible study group every Wednesday and on Sundays donating little plastic bags of pocket change.

She was shy to the point of leaving a room if a stranger walked in and always dressed conservatively, her boyfriend told Tampa Bay Times.

Swanson would spend hours alone in her room, reading the bible and listening to Christian radio.

It is a very different picture of the 42-year-old to that painted by her recent actions when she approached officers William Mechler, 26, and Rocky Howard, 31, 'armed, naked and irrational,' at a party on Saturday October 21.

One or both of the officers then opened fire, killing her, according to police.

She died at the scene around 1.15pm.

Details of events leading up to her death remain murky, with two men claiming to have seen her naked in the woods a short time earlier, Bay News 9 reported.

Al Eylward and Robert Collins described pulling over to ask if she was OK before taking pictures of her.

Mr Collins said: 'She was literally walking down the road straight at us.

'So, we pulled up alongside of her, and at that point I looked out the window and I asked her, I said, "Are you all right?" And she said, "Yeah, but I'm a little bit confused".'Â 

The men said they only took pictures because they did not think anyone would believe them without any evidence.

A short time later she walked inside a house holding a cross in her hands, they said.

'She held the cross up and made a circle like this and said, "Antichrist, Antichrist, this meeting is over",' Mr Eylward explained.

'And as she did that she stopped, turned around and walked back.

'At no time did any of us ever feel threatened and the only thing we ever saw in her hand was the cross,' he said.

Fifteen minutes later the 42-year-old was dead.

Mr Eylward said: 'This is a tragedy. It is, it really is. I had a friend that I was explaining this to and she asked me why I didn't call the cops right then and there, and as she said that it occurred to me that I should have. I should've called the cops.'

Swanson's boyfriend David Simpson today said she was extremely religious and thought that 'the end times were near'.

He also said the gun that she was carrying was an antique that only holds one bullet and doesn't fire.

Hernando County Sheriff Al Neinhuis 
told MyFoxTampaBay that Swanson 'was just acting irrational... It was 
obvious being naked she was not in her right mind.'

Swanson who had apparently not been invited to what was a family gathering, left briefly and returned armed, police said.

Sherriff Neinhuis said: 'They asked 
her to leave and after a while she did leave and the detective called 
the Sheriff's Office to let us know there was a woman in the area who 
was acting irrational and naked.

'She came back with a weapon and 
confronted both the Tampa police officer and my sheriff's office 
detective. She came with a weapon and I would surmise that they felt 
their life was in danger.'

Investigation: Police cordon off the rural scene. Swanson's boyfriend David Simpson today said she was extremely religious and thought that 'the end times were near'

Both the police officers involved in 
Swanson's death have been placed on administrative leave as the Florida 
Department of Law Enforcement investigates the shooting in the Spring 
Hill community.

One of the officers, William Mechler. The two have both been suspended pending an investigation

Howard has served six years, Mechler 
four. Tampa police said Mechler was 'off duty and acting in the capacity
of a private citizen.'

Lt Cinda Moore, a spokeswoman for the
Hernando sheriff's office, said in an email late on Saturday that she 
could not comment on what the woman specifically said or did or whether 
she was told to drop the weapon.

The Hernando County sheriff's office does permit the carrying of service weapons when off-duty, she said.

The Tampa-area shooting comes two 
weeks after a naked, unarmed University of South Alabama freshman was 
fatally shot by a campus police officer after going to the police 
station there and pounding on the glass.

Police said 18-year-old Gil Collar had taken LSD and acted aggressively when an officer came outside carrying a gun.

The officer repeatedly backed away 
from the student before firing. An attorney for the student's family 
says Collar never touched the officer and the fatal shooting never 
should have happened.

The shooting led to protests by students.

Authorities have said a grand jury will review that shooting to determine whether charges should be filed.
