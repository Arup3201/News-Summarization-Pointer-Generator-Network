Police were last night looking into bizarre new claims that the SAS murdered Princess Diana and Dodi Al Fayed – amid speculation  that the inquiry into their deaths could  be reopened.

Scotland Yard said officers from its Specialist Crime and Operations Command were ‘scoping’ the details and ‘assessing its relevance and credibility’, but stressed they had not reopened their investigation.

It is believed the key information originated with an ex-soldier who told his former wife and her parents some time ago he could throw new light on the deaths in 1997, and suggested the SAS were involved.

Bizarre story: Scotland Yard are 'scoping details' of claim Diana and Dodi Al-Fayed were murdered by SAS

Now the soldier’s former 
parents-in-law have come forward to pass the details on to the 
Metropolitan Police. MoD sources denied reports the Royal Military 
Police had played a role in passing on the information.

The
 development comes almost 16 years after Diana and Dodi were killed in a
 fatal Paris car crash when their Mercedes limousine hit a pillar in the
 Pont d’Alma underpass at around 80mph.

An
 inquest in 2008 found they were unlawfully killed due to the ‘gross 
negligence’ of their driver, Ritz Hotel security manager, Henri Paul, 
who had been drinking.

Many 
conspiracy theories have surrounded Diana’s death, and Dodi’s father, 
former  Harrods owner Mohamed Al Fayed, has always insisted he believes 
the couple were murdered.

The jury in the 2008 inquest concluded its verdict as 'unlawful killing, grossly negligent driving of the following vehicles and of the Mercedes', the Met said

In July 1999 a French appeals court rejected a request by Mohammed al Fayed for further  inquiries into the crash

He was informed of the new development last night by his PR adviser Michael Cole on the Fayed estate at Oxted, Surrey.

Mr Cole said: ‘Mohamed has always believed his son and Diana were murdered and he has consistently stuck to that line.

'He has always believed that something will break and he is watching developments with interest.’

Met sources played down the significance of the claims, describing it as ‘just a nugget we have to check out’.
