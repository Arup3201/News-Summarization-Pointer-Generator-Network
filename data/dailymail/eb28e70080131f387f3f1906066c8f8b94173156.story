A female sports reporter has hit back at two radio show hosts over a sexist Twitter exchange in which they referred to her  'giant boobs'.

Comcast Sports Network's Aiyana Cristal said she had been cyberbullied by  WSCR-AM 670 hosts Dan Bernstein and  Matt Spiegel adding: 'sexual harassment is never acceptable'.

Writing on her own Twitter page she described the comments as 'ignorant' and said the incident served as a 'gross reminder that women fight every day to be treated equally'.

Reporter Aiyana Cristal, who covers the Chicago Bulls for Comcast Sports Network, has hit back at two radio hosts over a sexist twitter exchange in which they referred to her 'giant boobs'

Criticism: Matt Spiegel and Dan Bernstein were involved in the exchange which referenced Cristal's breasts 

She said: 'Progress has been made for women in sports but we still have a long way to go'.

The shameful exchange began on Wednesday night when Ms Cristal was covering a Chicago Bulls basketball match. 

First Spiegel, host of The Spiegel & Goff Show  sent out a tweet criticizing her work.

It read: 'Aiyana Cristal makes me uncomfortable. I feel how hard she's trying, & end up awkwardly rooting for her to finish cleanly.'

Bernstein, who runs a show on WSCR in the afternoon, responded by saying: 'I have no rooting interest in her work, but enjoy her giant boobs.' 

Spiegel then says: 'I am improbably distracted from them by her professional discomfort, it's a crime.'

Bernstein responds: 'That's a complicated thought. Unpacking that is beyond me.'

Ms Cristal responded with a post on her own Twitter page in which she claimed that 'sexual harassment was never acceptable'

First Spiegel, host of The Spiegel & Goff Show on 670 AM, sent out a tweet criticizing her work

Bernstein, who runs a show on WSCR in the afternoon, responded, referring to her breats 

The pair were slammed by Twitter users who picked up the back-and-forth.

One person called it 'appalling' while another called it 'sexist as hell'. 

The pair have since removed their Tweets and have apologized. 

Bernstein said he was an 'idiot' on his social media page and addressed the discussion on his radio show.

Toni McIntyre slammed the exchange after it unfolded on social media 

Katie Bakes simply said: 'This conversation is appalling' under one of Bernstein's messages 

Spiegel issued a grovelling rebuttal on Twitter, which read: 'I missed an opportunity to keep the subject on point, & stay respectful. I'm sorry for that on many levels,& sad I offended Aiyana & others.

'My initial tweet was about a reporter's on air presence & work. I stand by that; fair game. I regret the exchange thereafter as it devolved.'

He also spoke about the conversation during his morning slot.

Other Twitter users have rallied round Ms Cristal. Sean Highkin ‏@highkin wrote: 'I hate that you even had to issue a statement about this. You didn't do anything except do your job.'

Gregg Juhlin ‏said: 'If only @670TheScore had the balls to suspend @dan_bernstein over this.'

Spiegel issued a grovelling apology on Twitter and spoke about the exchange during his talk show
