Two cowboy builders have been jailed for completing £5,000 worth of unnecessary renovations on an elderly man’s home - and charging more than £100,000.

The 69-year-old victim from Lewisham, south east London, was forced to hand over all of his life savings and take out a series of high-interest loans after he was targeted by the three rogue traders, who bombarded him with 300 calls in three months.

Leader Patrick O'Driscoll, 40, and an unknown associate first approached the man while posed as friendly builders ‘Steve’ and ‘Tony’, first convincing him  he had a leaky roof.

After carrying out the pointless work O'Drsicoll and his accomplices Danny Haygreen, 28, who was also jailed, and Damian Foley, 48, told the retired man his home needed more work.

It included new doors, stairs and re-plastering - the total cost of which should not have exceeded £5,000.

But the sick gang bombarded the unnamed victim with hundreds of phone calls at all hours  over three months last year, where they managed to convince him to hand over £94,000 for the work on his home.

The old man was so worried about his spiralling debts that he was about to sign the deeds of his home over to the gang in order to get them off his back.

The scheme was only discovered when a concerned bank manager notified police - and when Haygreen turned up to collect another £7000 from the man’s home, he was arrested.

Further investigation revealed the gang had also taken £16,000 from an 82-year-old man in Twickenham, south west London, and £37,000 from a 93-year-old man in Kensington.

In his victim impact statement, the 69-year-old victim from Lewisham, said: 'I feel the people who did this to me are the sort of people that should be put away for a long time.

'I think that if police had not got involved they would not have stopped demanding money from me.'

The three men were convicted and sentenced on Friday at Woolwich Crown Court.

O’Driscoll, of Potters Bar, north London, pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to defraud, and was sentenced today to five years in prison.

Foley, from Finchley, north London, pleaded guilty to three counts of money laundering and received a 19-month sentence.

Haygreen, from Hatfield, Herefordshire, was handed a nine-month suspended sentence after admitting attempting to obtain criminal property. He is not pictured because his punishment was less severe.

Investigating officer Detective Inspector Rob Fisher said: 'This group handpicked victims who lived alone and had a trusting nature.

Guilty: The three men were sentenced on Friday at Woolwich Crown Court. A statement on behalf of the victim said if the police had not intervened, the gang would have carried on demanding money

'Having convinced them that they needed work done, the group besieged the victims with phone calls, both to earn their trust and land them with increasingly extortionate debts.

'Their control over their victims was deeply disturbing. When we intervened, the victim in Lewisham was considering signing over the deeds to his house in order to settle the bill.

'He had also been convinced not to talk to anyone else about the supposed building work.

'The men had instructed him to only talk on the phone if the caller identified themselves as ‘Bravo One’, after which he had to identify himself as ‘Bravo Two’.

'The victims feared debt and they feared these men, who were aggressive and unrelenting in their pursuit of cash.

'It will be a long time, if ever, that the victims’ faith in others is restored but I hope that the conviction and sentencing of this unscrupulous group will at least help them begin to feel safer.'
