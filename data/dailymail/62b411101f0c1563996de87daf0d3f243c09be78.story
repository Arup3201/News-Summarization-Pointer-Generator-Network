Scientists have uncovered what they believe to be the oldest complete fossil anywhere on Earth.

The 3.5 billion year old fossil is the remains of what was once a purple and green slimy collection of single-cell microbes.

These microbes are likely to be a distant ancestor of humans and would have had a strong stench of rotting eggs, according to researchers.

The 3.5 billion year old fossil is the remains of what was once a purple and green slimy collection of single-cell microbes. Shown here is a rock surface displaying cracks in the 3.48 billion years old Dresser Formation, Pilbara region, Western Australia

The Pilbara region of Western Australia is one of the rare geological regions that provides insight into the early evolution of life on Earth.

Mound-like deposits created by ancient bacteria, called stromatolites, and microfossils of bacteria have previously been discovered in this region. 

However, a phenomenon called microbially induced sedimentary structures, or MISS, had not previously been seen in rocks of this great age

MISS not only demonstrate the presence of life, but also the presence of microbial ecosystems that could co-ordinate with one another.

Nora Noffke of Old Dominion University in the U.S. found the remnants of this life in sandstone rock in western Australia. 

The tiny fossilised mat, about one-third of an inch (8.3 millimetres) thick, would be about 300 million years older than previous complete ancient fossils, said study co-author Robert Hazen, a mineralogist at the Carnegie Institution of Science in Washington.

He said life on the mat probably had turned sunlight into energy, but produced ‘horribly smelly’ sulphur in the process, instead of oxygen.

He added that if you had walked the 
Australian beaches of 3.5 billion years ago, you would see a ‘slimy mass
 of purple or brown fibres emitting this stench of sulphur compounds but
 living very happily.’

‘This is not a place you would want to go to on your summer vacation,’ he said.

The
 Pilbara district of Western Australia, where the fossil was found, is 
famous for giving scientists insight into the early evolution of life.

A phenomenon called microbially induced sedimentary structures, or MISS, had not previously been seen in this region. These structures are formed from mats of microbial material, much like mats seen today on stagnant waters or in coastal flats

However, a phenomenon called microbially induced sedimentary structures, or MISS, had not previously been seen in this region.

These structures are formed from mats of microbial material - much like mats seen today on stagnant waters or in coastal flats.

Researchers believe the 
sedimentary structures arose from the interactions of bacterial films 
with shoreline sediments from the region.

‘The
 structures give a very clear signal on what the ancient conditions 
were, and what the bacteria composing the biofilms were able to do,’ 
said Professor Noffke.

MISS are among the targets of Mars rovers, which search for similar formations on the red planet's surface.

The
 discovery could now help inform further searches for life on Mars, 
where such remnants of life may be even better preserved.
