David Cameron entertained a host of sports stars at his grace and favour country home, officials revealed tonight.

The Prime Minister sneaked out a list of famous friends that he had invited to Chequers between October and December last year.

Among the group entertained at the Buckinghamshire mansion included the BBC's popular sports host Clare Balding, former England Rugby captain Will Carling and the cricket star Darren Gough.

Mr Cameron also invited sports minister Helen Grant, Tory MP Justin Tomlinson and former Ipswich FC chairman David Sheepshanks

The PM came under attack earlier this year when it was revealed that his hairdresser Lino Corbisiero was awarded an MBE in the New Year's honours list.

Mr Cameron, a keen cricket fan and tennis player, also invited record-breaking batsmen Mile Gatting, Olympic legends Sally Gunnell and Kathleen Grainger and the former England rugby captain Bill Beaumont.

The PM admitted the guests on the list - who have received official hospitality at the Prime Minister's official country residence - were entertained at the taxpayers' expense. Each attended the event with their partners, the list reveals.

Mr Cameron refuses to reveal anyone he entertains at the mansion out of his own pocket - or by the Conservative Party.
