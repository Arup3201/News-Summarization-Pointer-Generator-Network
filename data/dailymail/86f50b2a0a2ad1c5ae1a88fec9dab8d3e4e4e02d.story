Tour operators and bus companies have been warned they must pass on falling fuel costs to families booking their summer getaway.

Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander has written to package holiday firms demanding they cut prices after oil fell to a six-year low.

Petrol prices have dropped to below £1 a litre at forecourts in some areas, but other industries which blame high fuel costs for rising prices have not acted to cut charges.

Tour operators have been ordered by the Treasury to pass on falling fuel costs to reduce the price of family holidays 

The New Year heralds the start of the holiday booking season for many, with families planning their summer breaks during the winter gloom.

Mr Alexander wants package holiday firms to pass on savings accrued through lower air, coach and other holiday costs.

He has also written to five major bus operators calling on them to pass on the dramatic falls in the diesel price to customers through lower fares.

Mr Alexander said: ‘With fuel prices dropping across the country it’s right that the full benefits are passed on. Falling oil prices are like a giant tax cut to the economy. But the positive effect will only be felt if the oil price falls are passed on.

‘While drivers are already seeing the cost of filling up the car come down, the millions of Britons who use the bus are still paying what they did a few months ago.

‘On top of that many people will be planning their summer holidays now and looking for an early bargain. I want package tour operators to reflect the lower costs of fuel in their prices now.

“Consumers have suffered the pain of high oil prices, it’s only right that companies and organisations do all they can to pass on as quickly as possible every last penny of oil price falls.”

New figures released today show the average price for petrol last week was £1.08 and £1.16 for diesel, a dramatic fall from £1.30 and £1.38 a year ago.

But travel operators said it was difficult to pass on the savings, because many airlines and coach firms will have bought their fuel in advance when prices were higher.

A spokjesman for ABTA, the Association of British Travel Agents, said: ‘The fall in fuel prices is good news for consumers although they may have to wait to see the full effects of the price drop.

‘Many airlines buy their fuel in advance to enable a deal of certainty about prices and so may not immediately be in a position to pass on the benefits of lower fuel costs to consumers.’

Virgin Atlantic cut fuel surcharges by £10 on its long-haul flights last month, but other firms, including British Airways, have not followed suit.

Airline association IATA has predicted that over the course of 2015 consumers can expect to see worldwide airfares decrease by an average of 5 per cent thanks to lower fuel prices and faster global growth, ABTA added. 

‘Airlines and tour operators incorporate fuel costs, as well as a number of other cost factors, into the headline price that they charge consumers at the time of booking.’
