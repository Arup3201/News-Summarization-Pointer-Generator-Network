Police say they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident at the property in Duppas Hill, Croydon, yesterday afternoon.

The incident has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission due to officers 'having prior contact with the man arrested.'

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Detectives have launched a murder inquiry following the death of a 25-year-old woman.

'Police were called at 3:23pm on Thursday to reports of a disturbance at a residential address in Duppas Hill, Croydon.

'On arrival officers forced entry and found a 25-year-old woman suffering injuries. Paramedics attended and the woman was pronounced dead at the scene.'

He added: 'Whilst officers believe they know who the deceased is, they await all next of kin to be informed and a formal identification to take place.

'A 28-year-old man was also at the address with injuries. He was arrested at the scene on suspicion of murder, but was taken to a south London hospital where he remains in a critical condition.

'Also at the address was a six-year-old girl who has been taken into emergency foster care by Croydon Council Children’s Services.'

A post-mortem examination was taking place today at Croydon Mortuary.

The murder investigation is being lead by Detective Chief Inspector Russell Taylor of the Met’s Homicide and Serious Crime Command
