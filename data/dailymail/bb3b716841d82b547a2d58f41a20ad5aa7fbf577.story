Pope Francis has declared the internet is a ‘gift from God’ because it brings people from different cultures together.

In a statement about Catholic Church communications, Pope Francis said the web offers ‘immense possibilities’ for differing points of view to be heard, including those that oppose or question the Catholic religion.

Yet added our obsession with online conversations should never be used at the detriment of having face-to-face conversations with neighbours, friends and family.

Pope Francis (pictured) made the claims to German altar servers in Rome on Tuesday. He urged the young people not to waste 'too many hours on futile things', including chatting on the internet and smartphones, and watching TV soap operas

Pope Francis, 77, was elected in March last year to lead the world's 1.2 
billion Catholics.

He was born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires, Argentina and was one of five children.

He was named 2013 Person of the Year by Time magazine - edging out NSA whistleblower and fugitive Edward Snowden into second place.

His predecessor Pope Benedict 
XVI was the first pontiff to join Twitter.

Pope Francis regularly tweets in English to over three million followers, from the handle 
@pontifex.

Reports claim the Pope previously worked as bouncer when he was a student, and he has expressed a love of dancing.

Francis is the first non-European pope since Gregory III, who was elected in 731 and was born in modern-day Syria.

In his message on Thursday, Francis said: '[The internet] is something truly good, a gift from God.'

He continued that it should be used like 'a balm which relieves pain and a fine wine which gladdens hearts.'

Yet warned: 'The desire for digital connectivity can have the effect of isolating us from our neighbors, from those closest to us.'

The Pontiff also declared the internet is a powerful tool because it lets people of various religions engage in dialogues about their faiths. 

He believes it shouldn't be used just to preach the Catholic word, but to discuss the benefits the religion has while accepting other religions may offer alternatives. 

'A dialogue means to believe that the 'other' has something 
worthwhile to say, and to entertain his or her point of view and 
perspective,' explained Pope Francis.

'Engaging in dialogue does not mean 
renouncing our own ideas and traditions, but the pretense that they 
alone are valid and absolute.'

The comments come after Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi declared in September that Jesus was the world's first tweeter because his sermons and messages were 'brief and full of meaning.'

He has previously been praised for embracing technology, as seen in this image where he posed for a selfie with a group of tourists at the Vatican

Gianfranco Ravasi made the comments while addressing a group of newspaper editors at a conference in Italy.

He added that Christ 'used tweets before everyone 
else, with elementary phrases made up of fewer than 45 characters such as 
'Love one another'.

Cardinal Ravasi stated that the church should be doing all it can to take full advantage of the internet as a way of getting the message of God to the masses.
