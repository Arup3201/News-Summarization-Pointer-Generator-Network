William Saunderson-Smith 58, was murdered in his home by the three Polish builders who were each sentenced to life in prison today

Three Polish builders who beat a reclusive multi-millionaire to death and went on a spending spree with his money have each been jailed for life.

Dawid Rymar, Slawomir Bugajewski and Ireneusz Mydlarz crept into 58-year-old William Saunderson-Smith’s bedroom and ambushed him as he slept, before making off with £2,000.

£250,000 in cash in the attic of the property, as well as £100,000 secreted in another house owned by Saunderson-Smith, went unnoticed by the killers.

The court heard Rymar, 24, and Bugajewski, 39, spent the money they had stolen on a trip to Paris, where they posed for photographs in front of the Eiffel Tower, en route to their native Poland.

37-year-old Mydlarz, flew directly back to his homeland, but not before spending some of the money he had stolen on an iPad and designer clothes.

The Old Bailey was told that the trio had planned their raid in meticulous detail, scoping out nearby streets in a bid to avoid detection on CCTV.

And Rymar was so confident he had cheated justice he agreed to fly back from Poland for questioning by police without an extradition warrant.

But the killers had failed to notice a camera on a West Kensington hotel, which captured their movements on the night of the murder.

DNA from Mr Saunderson-Smith was also found inside a Land Rover Bugajewski had bought from a friend a few days earlier.

The three had all denied murder but were convicted following a three-week trial at the Old Bailey.

Mydlarz attempted to deny his involvement by claiming he had only been employed by the pair to watch their victim’s car.

The Recorder of London, Judge Peter Beaumont QC, sentenced them all to life imprisonment with a minimum of 30 years before parole.

He said: ‘I see no reason to distinguish between any of you. Each of you lent yourself and involved yourself in a deliberate planned attack on a man in his own home for gain.

‘It was predicated on violence to beat out of him where the money was hidden in that house. In furtherance of that plan he was literally beaten to death in his bedroom in circumstances of extreme violence.

‘He didn’t stand a chance.’

Mr Saunderson-Smith, known to friends as John, owned a large portfolio of properties in west London, many of which were let to visitors from Australia and New Zealand.

He dealt mainly in cash, stashing vast sums around the houses he owned, and preferred to use Polish builders for renovation work.

His killers had carried out renovations for him in the weeks before his death and detectives believe he had unwittingly revealed the location of some of the money to at least one of them.

On the night of his death they lay in wait until he turned off the lights and went to bed before forcing open a sash window and attacking him in his bedroom.

He was discovered by a young assistant at his property in West Kensington, last October 21.

Each of the killers, who had all been having financial problems, got away with around £2,000 - but a further £250,000 stashed in his attic went ‘plainly undetected’, the court heard.

Mr Saunderson-Smith, described by friends as ‘reclusive’ and ‘scruffy’, had been obsessive about the possibility of being burgled since his stepfather was attacked years earlier.

He often kept a bayonet-type blade close to his bed as he slept but did not have it with him on the night he was killed.

Mr Jafferjee said: ‘He was plainly taken was surprise, the range and extent of his injuries being far beyond anything required merely to subdue him, which suggests a beating to get him to reveal where his money was before he was finally finished off.’
