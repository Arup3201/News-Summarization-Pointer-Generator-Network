As chairman of Ofsted, she was the guardian of good behaviour for the nation’s schoolchildren.

But a rather less wholesome side to Zenna Atkins has emerged after enraged parents complained about X-rated comments posted on her publicly available Facebook page.

In one smutty post, the 49-year-old boasted of offering to perform a sex act on a ‘very handsome man’, and in another she posted a picture of herself making a lewd gesture.

Parents have slammed former Ofsted chief Zenna Atkins, 49, (pictured), who is now chairman of a school's governing board, over x-rated messages she posted on Facebook

Miss Atkins was Ofsted chief from 2006 to 2010 and is now the chairman of governors at a school in Brighton. Her Facebook posts – branded ‘absolute filth’ by parents – are the kind of adult material that pupils might be scolded for viewing on their smartphones.

Had she still been chief at the schools watchdog, she would have presided over its recent drive to drum into children the perils of ‘sharing personal data’.

It is a lesson that Miss Atkins has learnt the hard way, after parents noticed the nature of the remarks she was sharing with the world on Facebook.

One post appeared on the site saying the ‘handsome’ man to whom she had offered a sexual service had replied: ‘Nah... I’d rather watch Jools Holland!’ and she added: ‘How sad is that!’

This joke, made on New Year's Eve sparked anger from parents after appeared on Ms Atkins's Facebook page. The site was public at the time, but has since been made private

Another crude joke seen on Ms Atkins's Facebook profile when it was publicly visible

One parent sent this anonymous letter to the school, complaining about the comments and pictures on Ms Atkins's Facebook page

Ms Atkins, 49, stepped down as chair of Ofsted in October 2010 after causing fury by making comments about every school needing a 's*** teacher'

It got 23 likes – seen as marks of approval – from her Facebook friends.

Another posting showed a photo of three people sharing a bed under a coarse joke which began: ‘Three in a bed and the little one said...’

Miss Atkins also posted a photo of herself in a hospital bed sticking one finger up to the camera in a rude gesture. She is the chairman of the board of governors at the 900-pupil Portslade Aldridge Community Academy in Brighton.

One parent said: ‘It’s just not on. My son’s class have been told time and time again to conduct themselves properly on social media, yet the chair of the governors goes and does whatever she wants.’

Another wrote an anonymous letter of complaint saying: ‘I find it appalling this lady has these things on her Facebook page for all to see, including students. I do not believe such a person should be in a position of authority.’

A mother of three, who asked not to be named, said: ‘It is horrible to see things like that on Facebook, especially when it is open for all to see. It is absolute filth.’

Although the page has since been made private, the contents came to the attention of parents at Portslade Aldridge Community Academy in Brighton (pictured) where Ms Atkins is now chair of governors

Another parent said: ‘It’s not a good message to be sending out. It questions their professionalism.’

The posts on her Facebook profile could previously be viewed by anyone but have been made private since the complaints.

Miss Atkins declined requests to comment but a spokesman for the Aldridge Foundation said: ‘Neither the academy, the foundation, nor the local authority-nominated governor has received any complaint regarding this.

‘Zenna Atkins’ professional social network profile can be viewed publicly on LinkedIn. She has confirmed that her Facebook account is intended for a private network of close friends and family.

‘She and her fellow governors talk with parents on a regular basis and take their views very seriously.’
