For winter, Sister by Sibling sent models dressed in giant knits and enormous wool balaclavas down the catwalk.

But their vision for next summer is an altogether more sophisticated affair, albeit with one with a dose of the label's typically quirky aesthetic,

The trio behind the brand, Joe Bates, Sid Bryan and Cozette McCreery, captured the elegant primness of a post New Look American housewife to perfection.

Sophisticated: Sister by Sibling gave a modern twist to retro glamour with this 1950s inspired collection

Edgy: Silk rosettes and daring styling helped give these 50s inspired looks a very modern edge

'This is Waspish Sunday Best, with the woman upholding the fragile veneer of domestic glamour, the hostess cocooned in a copy of a copy of a copy of Dior, her exquisite "good taste" admired and coveted by her friends and now Sibling,' said the trio after their highly anticipated show at Somerset House this morning.

Watched by the original Sugababes, now renamed Mutya, Keisha, Siobhan, and socialite Laura Bailey, models glided down the catwalk in shell tops and pencil skirts, nipped in bodies, full skirts and A-line shift dresses.

In keeping with the housewife theme, trapeze coats came in colours taken from plastic Tupperware although the colour of the season - baby pink - dominated. 

Sportswear jerseys were branded with bold slogans such as 'lead sister' and 'happy' and echoed the 50s silhouette that inspired the collection.

This season also saw Sibling's first foray into denim and ladylike spots and lavish hand-embellished bralets evoked a carefree insouciance giving the collection a modern twist.  

There was elegant dresses, super short skirts and crochet-trimmed coats paired with sophisticated  knits, while clutch bags came in denim and were used by grinning models to keep cool on the runway.

Of course, in true Sibling style, knitwear was prominent and came with injections of leopard print in neon.

And the new collection seems to have already garnered some celebrity fans. Speaking after the show, the Sugababes said: 'Wow, we loved it. We wanted to steal everything from the models on the runway.

Singer Keisha Buchanan added: 'My favourite outfit was the red skirt teamed with leopard print jersey. Our favourite thing about London Fashion Week is always Sister by Sibling so we are so excited to be here.'
