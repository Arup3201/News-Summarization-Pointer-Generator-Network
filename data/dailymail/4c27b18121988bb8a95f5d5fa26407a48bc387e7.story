Formula One grand prix weekends are poised to undergo a revolution from as early as next year.

As part of the ongoing debate with regard to cost saving among the 12 teams, one of the proposals under discussion relates to a scaling back of the current Friday format.

For many years the sport has run two 90-minute practice sessions, but one possibility that could be pushed through would see the teams only run for one 90-minute outing in the afternoon.

The thinking behind the move is that not only will money be saved on the track with the running of just one session, but it allows teams to arrive a day later at venues and so save on travel expenditure.

Whether or not race promoters will be happy with the cars featuring less on their tracks has yet to be determined.

The move could be ratified by the end of the month following meetings of the Formula One Commission and FIA World Motor Sport Council.

Both are scheduled to sit over the coming weeks, and needing to give approval before cementing the changes in next year's regulations.

The Commission, in particular, is crucial as promoters sit on that body and may yet throw a spanner in the works.

Another suggestion could see a ban on in-season testing, which only returned this year.
