Spending on contactless cards more than trebled last year to a record £2.32billion, figures show.

Users made ten contactless payments every second in 2014 as they entered mainstream use. It means they were used a total of 319.2million times, the UK Cards Association reports.

The steep rise has prompted the spending limit on the cards to be increased to £30 from September this year.

At the moment shoppers can pay for items worth up to £20 simply by touching it against a reader, rather than entering their PIN or signing anything.

There are now 58million contactless cards in circulation in the UK and they are accepted by many major chains and organisations including Aldi, Boots, Waitrose and even Barnardo's.

Transport for London launched contactless payments across the transport network in the capital last September.

Shashi Verma, Transport for London's director of customer experience, said: 'We have seen over 41 million journeys made across London using contactless within just five months.

'Using contactless payments to travel can save our customers time, they don't need to stop to top-up an Oyster card, or buy a ticket.'

People using contactless spend £8.26 per transaction, on average.

Separate figures revealed that Bristol has seen the most significant increase in contactless usage in 2014, when compared with the country's other major cities.

Barclaycard said that contactless payments in Bristol saw 150 per cent growth between January 1 and December 31 last year. 

London saw the second biggest upswing in contactless transactions, recording a 130 per cent increase over the same period.

London leads the way when it comes to overall contactless use, according to Barclaycard's figures. 

Nearly one in three card transactions taking place last year in London were contactless, according to Barclaycard's data.

London was closely followed by Leeds, where the proportion of transactions on cards which were contactless was 27.3 per cent.  

Richard Koch, head of policy at the UK Cards Association, which is the trade body for the card payments industry, said: 'Contactless has now firmly stepped into the mainstream.

'With usage soaring every month last year, we've seen people flocking to contactless payments as they switch away from cash.

'For retailers, contactless means quicker queues at the tills and greater convenience for their customers.'
