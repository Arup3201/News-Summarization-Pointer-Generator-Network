Three people have died and seven others needed medical attention after using cocaine laced with a narcotic painkiller, authorities said on Monday.

The deaths and injuries took place over a span of several hours early on Saturday in North Carolina's Chatham County, sheriff's office spokesman Doug Stuart said.

All the deaths and injuries happened within six hours of each other and in three different locations. Six people were taken to hospital and one was given medical treatment.

Perry Saunders, 23, of Aurora, Missouri, was named as one of those who died on Saturday from ingesting cocaine laced with painkiller in North Carolina 

One of those hospitalized is believed to be in a critical condition.  

A sheriff's deputy told WNCN that the drugs killed each victim within an hour of being taken. 

The dead were named as Michael Currie, 42, of Bear Creek; Randal Welch, 24, of Franklinville; and 23-year-old Perry Saunders of Aurora, Missouri.

Currie died at his home while Welch and Saunders died at a separate address in Bear Creek. 

Autopsies are being performed by the North Carolina Medical Examiner.  

The state crime lab studied a sample of the cocaine and found indications it had the narcotic painkiller Fentanyl in it. 

Fentanyl is estimated to be 80 times as potent as morphine and hundreds of times more potent than heroin, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

The substance, which is odorless, is an opioid painkiller in the morphine family and used as part of anesthesia to help prevent pain after surgery.

It depresses the central nervous system and respiratory function.

'We haven't determined how it ended up in there. We don't know if it was a mix-up, or something done on purpose,' Captain Doug Stuart said.

The police officer said that they are working with state and federal agencies because 'what’s in North Carolina today could be in Chicago tomorrow'.

Stuart said federal officials are helping to investigate but that no arrests have been made.

Fentanyl is an opioid painkiller in the morphine family. Three died after it was used to lace cocaine in North Carolina this weekend
