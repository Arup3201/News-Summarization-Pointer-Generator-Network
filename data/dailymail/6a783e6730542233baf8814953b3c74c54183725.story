A couple were married at a gas station pump with police officers as witnesses after the groom was arrested on the way to his wedding.

Police pounced on Caleb Rogers, 28, with their weapons drawn after he was found at a gas station on Thursday. Rogers had violated his parole.

After he was put in handcuffs, Rogers told police that he had been en route to tie the knot with his fiancee in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

The officers decided to show some leniency and allow the ceremony to go aheadÂ  - but on the forecourt.

Police turned into wedding planners and set everything up for the couple, calling in a Justice of the Peace.

Albuquerque 
Police Department Officer Mark Aragon told KOAT: 'Obviously
they had the compassion to go ahead and allow the ceremony, but we were
also safe about it. He was under arrest and handcuffed.

He added: 'I guess you could call it a love story.'

However the honeymoon was off - Rogers was wanted for violating his parole and was being held without bond.

He has a long criminal history mostly involving drugs and charges including kidnapping, aggravated battery and extortion.

Rogers had been due to attend a parole meeting last Wednesday but didn't show up.

He claims it was because he wanted to get married. Official say that he skipped the appointment because of a mandatory drugs test.
