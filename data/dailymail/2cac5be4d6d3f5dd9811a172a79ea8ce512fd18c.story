Dusk is a wonderful time in the grounds of Lower Barton, a luxurious thatched house deep in the Devon countryside.

As the sun sets over Dartmoor and the treetops of Haldon Forest are bathed in the day’s last light, a herd of fallow deer gather in the back garden.

While the fawns, only weeks old, gambol in the meadows, the older bucks and does munch apples from the hands of owners Barry and Marthe Gomer.

Close to nature: Marte Gomer, 58, feeds the deer at Lower Barton which her and her husband are now selling for £900,000

By the time night has fallen, the deer have retreated to the woods, and an even more magical show begins.

Beneath the window of a downstairs bedroom a group of badgers is clawing at the wall, waiting for Marthe and Barry to arrive with treats of bird nuts and the odd Malteser, which they chomp noisily.

The bolder ones even poke their snouts through the cat flap, and when feeding time is over they use the decking as a race track.

‘They started coming into the garden and eating nuts that had fallen from the bird-feeders and then they came closer to the house,’ says Marthe, 58, a journalist.

‘We get pheasants in the kitchen and every morning Barry has to move the buck that sleeps next to his car. If I go for a walk in the fields and woods, fallow deer, cats, pheasants, the occasional badger and two robins trail along behind me.’

Thatched dream: The garden outside the three-bedroom Devon home is frequently visited by the local wildlife

The deer have been giving birth recently and the garden doubles as a creche. ‘Fawns are the funniest, cutest creatures you can imagine – a bit like lambs but even faster and more bouncy,’ says Marthe.

‘And every year we get to watch the rut, in which the bucks fight for supremacy, from the comfort of our armchairs. The noise and bellowing is terrific.’

The couple bought the detached three-bedroom house with 12 acres in 1999 for £280,000, and gradually the local fauna joined them.

‘We decided to buy it before we’d been inside – we’d arranged to meet the estate agent and arrived early, so walked around the garden and found a fawn asleep in the grass,’ says Marthe, who is selling the house through Savills (01392 455755) for £895,000.

Although the animals are far from tame, they seem unfazed by human activity. ‘We can have as many as 30 friends eating outside with a herd of deer grazing next to us,’ says Barry, 62, a photographer.

‘We don’t cosset them – we just let them be themselves and that’s what makes it so special.’

Unexpected guests: When current owner Marthe cooks in the 28ft long, kitchen, she is often visited by the near-tame deer heard, looking for food

The delightful cottage garden has been 
fenced to prevent damage from deer, but when dormice set up home in 
Barry’s vegetable garden he left them there and has not picked up his 
hoe since.

Lower Barton sits above the pretty village of Higher Ashton in the Teign Valley, seven miles from Exeter. Internally, the house is a blend of ancient and contemporary.

It was built 20 years ago in the style of a country cottage but has high ceilings, large rooms, vast windows and the mod cons not usually associated with thatched houses – as well as underfloor heating and air-conditioning, the house has a Jacuzzi.

It is all rather surprising as the house was originally conceived as a modest dwelling for a part-time pig-breeder, but when his business went under it was repossessed and the Gomers stepped in.

The kitchen, 28ft long, is the hub of the house and has views over their land and beyond, and when the deer see Marthe at the sink they amble to the window in search of food.

Badgering for treats: As the night falls, local badgers scratch at the bedroom walls and happily munch away at bird nuts and Maltesers which the Gomers feed them

The main sitting room, again huge, has a vaulted ceiling and large stone fireplace, and is on the first floor to take full advantage of the views. Also upstairs is the master bedroom, with another fireplace and an en suite shower and bathroom, but the two other bedrooms, and a family bathroom, are at ground level.

In the park-like grounds there is an old piggery that now doubles as a garage and a roost for swallows, sparrows and bats, but it could be converted for commercial use.

As well as the formal gardens and meadows, the grounds encompass forestry and a brook from which the deer drink.

It is hard to see why the couple want to move from this idyllic spot, but they are house-hunting in France. They admit they’ll struggle to find something as beautiful and they will not find the wildlife, as the French tend to shoot anything on four legs.

Their cat, Wally, will also miss his playmates. ‘He hides in the long grass until the bucks graze close enough for him to launch himself at their heads,’ says Barry.

‘Then he hangs on until they shake him off  and he’s somersaulted away before making a mad dash for the safety of the house with a buck in full flight right behind him.’
