A landowner whose MP brother claimed expenses for cleaning a moat is embroiled in a planning row over the road to his 18th Century country manor.

Aristocrat's son James Hogg, 63, started work without planning permission on a 'minimal' upgrade to an entrance of Grade II*-listed Wherwell Priory near Andover, Hampshire.

But the work prompted a complaint from neighbours who live next to the road - in his 100-acre estate's Grade II-listed former gatehouse.

Dispute: This gatepost is the centre of a row between James Hogg, the brother of an expenses-claiming MP, and the couple who live at the former gatehouse (pictured) of his 100-acre estate in Hampshire's Test Valley

Mr Hogg said his builders were simply putting a kerb on the road, but neighbours Martin and Gail Starbuck said it looked like 'a large lay-by'.

And they said it could increase the number of lorries using their local entrance to the estate, which has other entrances, risking damage to the Grade II-listed gateposts next to their home.

Test Valley Borough Council sent enforcement officers and the work has now been halted until the council decides whether Mr Hogg should be granted retrospective planning permission.

Mr Hogg is the son of the late Lord Hailsham, a prominent politician who served as Leader of the Lords, Education Secretary and Lord High Chancellor before his death in 2001 aged 94.

His brother Douglas Hogg, now the third Viscount Hailsham, was an agriculture minister under John Major but stepped down from the Commons in 2010 after his expenses were exposed.

'Lay-by': Photos were submitted to Test Valley Borough Council to show the extent of the works so far after James Hogg's neighbours Martin and Gail Starbuck complained roadworks had ruined their country view

In one of the most notorious incidents in the MPs' expenses scandal, Douglas Hogg agreed to repay the £2,200 cost of cleaning a moat at his country home after he charged it to the taxpayer.

James Hogg was not implicated in the row, but also owns a large estate.

Built on the site of a former 10th Century abbey, Wherwell Priory is on a 100-acre island in the middle of the River Test and is used as a wedding venue.

In a letter to planners, Mr Hogg's agent said the work was 'de minimis' - Latin for small-scale.

He added: 'The access road itself does not require consent as it has been in existence for at least the period of current ownership beginning in 1990, and was indeed used by the present owners (the applicant) when moving in as the only viable route for removal vans.

'The proposal is to construct a kerb which will limit the spread of the existing scalpings used to formulate the road and delineate its line on a permanent basis.

'The road already exists and the central philosophy of this project is simply to maintain and improve it.

'This will make it more usable as the current arrangement is slightly too small for the use of normal delivery vehicles.'

But father-of-two Mr Starbuck, 57, who has lived with his wife in the Priory's former gatehouse for 24 years, said the work had disrupted what was 'until a few months ago a green paddock'. 

He said: 'It is now a monstrosity. It has pretty well finished. It is an eyesore - it is a hell of a mess. It is absolute nonsense to say it has been there since 1990. It is new. It was a fenced paddock. 

'We rang the council and asked if they needed planning permission and the council came down and said he needed permission.

'The council then spoke to Mr Hogg and the work stopped. Mr Hogg has now put in these applications.' 

In a letter to Test Valley Borough Council, Mr and Mrs Starbuck added: 'The applications make reference to the access road to the south of the listed gateposts as being in existence since 1990. This is untrue.

'During our residency we have witnessed a gradual, progressive and unauthorised opening up of an alternative entrance to the south of the listed gateposts to allow access by HGVs and other traffic to serve the growing business demands of Wherwell Priory. 

'It can clearly be seen from the road [and] it totally detracts from what was a pleasing view of historic parkland... To all intents and purposes it resembles a large lay-by.'

They added: 'We are convinced and extremely concerned that this development unless reversed will lead to significantly increased levels of traffic passing within feet of our home.' 

Wherwell Parish Council chairman Jane Andrews said: 'We need to look into this. It is a shame because we obviously hate neighbour disputes and we like to feel common sense prevails.' 

A Test Valley Borough Council spokesman said: 'This matter was brought to our attention and investigated by our enforcement team.

'The applicant was then advised planning permission was required for it. Retrospective applications were then made.'

The council is expected to make its decision in the summer.

Mr Hogg has been contacted for comment.
