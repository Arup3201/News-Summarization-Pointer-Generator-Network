POCHETTINO'S £100M BENCH 

Tottenham had a bench stocked with approximately £100million worth of signings at White Hart Lane. 

As it happened, the three most expensive recruits in the club’s history — Erik Lamela (£30m), Roberto Soldado (£26m) and Paulinho (£17m) — were all among those in the dug-out. 

Lamela was the only one of the three to get on.

For a man so aggrieved by fixture congestion, it was surprising to see Louis van Gaal name the same 11 who beat Newcastle 48 hours earlier. 

It was United’s first unchanged Premier League side since November 2012 — 85 games.

TRIBUTE TO SPURS LEGEND 

There was a minute’s applause before the game for Tottenham’s double-winner Ron Henry, who died on Saturday aged 80. 

The defender won the league and FA Cup in 1961, as well as the FA Cup in 1962 and the European Cup-Winners’ Cup in 1963. He also won one cap for England.

Mauricio Pochettino was happy with Tottenham’s defending and their clean sheet. But Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher was less than impressed with the vast spaces their back line left behind them. He tweeted: ‘Thought a change of manager at Spurs would see the end of the suicidal high line. Last three managers seem to favour it!’ 

Luke Shaw returned from an ankle injury on Sunday after a month with his feet up in Cristiano Ronaldo’s house. The left back is renting Ronaldo’s £4m, five-bedroom house in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, which includes an indoor swimming pool, steam room, Jacuzzi, gym and wine store. 

The 19-year-old is paying the Portuguese star £7,000 a month to rent the luxury property.
