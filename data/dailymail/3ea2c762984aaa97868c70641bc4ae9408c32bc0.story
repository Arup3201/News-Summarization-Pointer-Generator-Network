A remarkable photographic exhibition shows the family homes abandoned to decay on remote Scottish islands because relatives cannot bear to sell them.

The haunting images, taken in the Outer Hebrides by former Buzzcocks drummer John Maher, show the properties slowly rotting away and remaining untouched and unchanged since the day the owner died.

The homes, many of them original crofters' cottages miles from the nearest road, appear frozen in time and some have become memorials to the dead of the islands.

This crofters' cottage on the Isle of Scalpay has clearly not been inhabited for years - the original stone chimneys can be seen, in contrast to the corrugated iron front, which would have been a relatively recent addition in order to keep out the bitter Hebridean winds

In some cases, estate agents have received enquires to buy the properties but were ordered to turn them down as relatives cling on to past lives in crofting communities.

Now the stories behind the lost homes of Lewis, Harris and other islands have been revealed with the help of social media and will form part of an exhibition in Edinburgh which opens on January 4.

The exhibition will feature pictures taken by Maher and Fife-based photographer Ian Paterson as well as a new concerto composed by former Scots Trad Music Awards winner Mike Vass.

The hauntingly beautiful photographs show lives suspended in time with wedding pictures on mantelpieces, beds fully made and even dinner plates on the table.

Mr Mahar, who drummed on 70s hits such as Ever Fallen in Love, stumbled across the hidden treasures when taking outdoor nighttime photographs around the Outer Hebrides.

After entering the lost homes his interest soon turned to what was inside.

'In some of them you see so many personal belongings that have been left behind,' said Maher.

'There was one house with a suitcase on the bed and letters on the side board that haven't been opened.'

This photo, titled 'George's House' was taken on the small Island of Eriskay which lies between South Uist and the Isle of Barra

He continued: 'In some houses it would be quite easy to spook yourself.'

He teamed up with photographer Ian Paterson and soon the stories behind the mysterious houses started to emerged.

Mr Paterson explained: 'The houses just exist as they are. It's very emotive. People still have a very close emotional attachment. There are a lot of emotions tied up in them.'

After getting in touch with relatives through Facebook the story behind one of properties soon emerged.

The house in Harris photographed by Maher still packed full of belongings was built by Kenneth and Peggy MacKinnon.

Although the couple left the island in their later years they continued to make an annual pilgrimage home to light the fire and sit in the front room together.

'One of her [Peggy's] last wishes was for the house to remain as it was,' said Paterson. 'There is still a very strong personal connection.'

'When the older generation die off there is no one to take the houses over,' explained a Stornoway estate agent.

The agent, who asked not to be named, said often people ask about old abandoned croft houses - 'where people are looking for that kind of lifestyle on the island'.

This blue bedroom was photographed on South Uist - a mirror remains over the fireplace and the paint is in suprisingly good condition

This attic bedroom in a cottage on Lewis has a beautiful original fireplace painted pink - which contrasts with the peeling walls and dusty floor

The houses are often left to lie as they are by families after the death of the owners as a memorial to their loved ones

But families often don't want to sell because 'it's the original family home'.

'It's sentimental family values. They have no intention to live in them at the moment,' she said.

The remote locations of a lot of the properties - many of which were built before the roads and are not accessible by car - mean they lay hidden out of sight.

Now they are at the mercy of the notorious Hebridean weather.

'Quite a few of these will disappear in the next five or ten years,' said Paterson.

He added: 'Not all decay is bad decay. There is a lot of memories.'

The exhibition 'Away Being' is launched on January 4th in Gallery 1 at St Margaret's House, 151 London Road, Edinburgh.

The Outer Hebrides are also known as the Western Isles, the Long Isle and in Gaelic, as Na h-Eileanan Siar and Innse Gall.

The Outer Hebrides are comprised of an island chain off the west coast of mainland Scotand.

The 15 inhabited islands form part of the Hebrides, separated from the Scottish mainland and from the Inner Hebrides by the waters of the Minch, the Little Minch and the Sea of the Hebrides. 

The inhabited islands have a total population of 27,400 - but there are more than 50 substantial uninhabited islands.

The Western Isles became part of the Norse kingdom of the Suðreyjar, which lasted for over 400 years until sovereignty was transferred to Scotland by the Treaty of Perth in 1266.

Control of the islands was then held by clan chiefs, principal of whom were the MacLeods, MacDonalds, Mackenzies and MacNeils.

The Highland Clearances of the 19th century, combined with the potato famine, had a devastating effect on many of the islands and it is only in recent years that population levels have stopped declining.

Much of the land is now under local control and commercial activity is based on tourism, crofting, fishing, and weaving. 

The 1949 comedy Whisky Galore! was filmed on the Isle of Barra, the southernmost inhabited island in the Outer Hebrides.

The film is based on the novel Whisky Galore by Sir Compton Mackenzie, itself a fictionalised telling of the story of the SS Politician, which ran aground with a cargo of 50,000 cases of whisky on board in 1941.
