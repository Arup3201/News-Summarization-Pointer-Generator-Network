Comedian John Bishop has told with heart-warming honesty how stand-up and relationship counselling saved his marriage.

In the early days of his marriage he says he was a blunt, unemotional Northerner who was unable to express his feelings to his wife Melanie.

But when the couple separated he took up stand-up comedy and started talking about the split during his stage routine.

It was only when Melanie chanced upon him performing that she fell  in love with him again.

They went on to get their relationship back on track with the help of some Relate counselling.

‘Both stand-up and going to Relate changed me,’ Bishop said in an  exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday.

‘I stopped being scared of talking about what I felt. The consequences of not doing that are bigger than the consequences of doing it.

‘When I was younger, I wasn’t very emotional. But there’s a point in your life where there’s nothing to be scared of any more. I just didn’t realise it at the time.’

Bishop, 46, who has now told his life story in an autobiography,  was raised on a council estate in Runcorn, Cheshire. He met Melanie at college in Manchester and they married in 1993.

He assumed the traditional male role, providing for Melanie and their sons – Joe, now 19, Luke, 17, and Daniel, 15 –  through a well-paid job in pharmaceutical sales.

However, the long hours took their toll on the marriage, and the couple separated in 2000.

In the same year, Bishop made his stand-up debut, having chanced upon an open-mic night at The Frog And Bucket comedy club in Manchester.

Enticed by the offer of a free drink, Bishop got up and started talking about his life.

He found it therapeutic and was rewarded with laughter, so he did it again – and again. A comedy star was born, although it was a while before Bishop gave up his day job.

Some 18 months after that life-changing performance, Melanie came into the club with friends and was shocked to find her estranged husband on stage talking about their break-up.

She says this was the moment she began to fall back in love with him.

Having discovered that they had both booked time off work for the same dates, the couple decided to go away together with the boys.

However, their reconciliation was still far from a done deal.

‘Even after the holiday, things could have gone either way,’ Bishop said. ‘It was Relate that helped us.

'We were able to discuss what went wrong. It’s a British disease of building up barriers. I think that’s breaking down now and people are more open to the idea of counselling and talking things through.

‘That’s a really good thing. You’ll probably have half a dozen sessions and the penny will drop. And that can change the rest of your life.

'All of a sudden you realise things have been said but you couldn’t hear them.’

Bishop says that now he’s radically changed and is always honest about everything. On stage, he allows himself to be completely vulnerable.

He has also become known for  his charity work. In 2012, he completed a 290-mile triathlon, raising a record £3.4 million for Sport Relief.

However, Bishop says: ‘I’m still a long way from being perfect. I’ve learnt a lot about myself from writing my autobiography.’

His memoir – How Did All This Happen? – is extremely funny in parts and sad, raw and vulnerable in others.

The book suggests Melanie has changed, too. Did having three children under five contribute to their break-up?

‘Yes, quite possibly that was going on,’ he says. ‘Sometimes people dismiss it by saying, “Oh, it’s post-natal depression. It’s a woman thing.” But you know what? It’s not.

‘Being under a degree of pressure all day can be very serious.

‘Looking after kids is the most important thing in society, it is the future, and it’s the one thing that you can never practise.

'There is never a lesson in school about how to be a good parent. You are just given the most important thing in the world and told to sort it out.’

Even family experience didn’t seem to help the young couple – John’s own father had four children by the time he was 24.

‘As I say in the book, on our estate in Runcorn, when we were growing up that was normal.’ But for John and Melanie, the experience of having children was overwhelming.

When the marriage broke down, John says he was incredibly lonely. However, he did not play the field, preferring to spend time with his sons.

‘There was the odd girl I went out with. But no one ever met the kids and I never saw anyone on the weekend. Maybe over time that would have changed, but it didn’t for two years.’

So did he remain single because he always thought he would get back together with Melanie?

‘Possibly. But also I didn’t want any other call on my time apart from my kids. I didn’t want anyone saying “But why can’t I see you on Wednesday?” And I’d have to say, “Well, if I’ve got the boys I’ll have  to see if I can change it.” I just didn’t want any of that.

‘Melanie said there were some parts of the book that were harder to read than others and some that were uplifting.

'When I got into conversations with publishers and they said they wanted lots of funny stories I said, no, I’m writing a book about my life.

'I don’t regard it as more unusual than anyone else’s but what is unusual is I’ve been in a position where people asked me to write about it.

‘My life could only have happened if all of those things had happened.

‘The pain we had in our relationship – it sounds cliched – but it made us stronger.’
