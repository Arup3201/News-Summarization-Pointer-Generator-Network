When a silent 999 call came through, police were taking no chances.

The address was traced and officers were dispatched.

With no response to their knocking and ringing of the bell, they battered down the front door and discovered, to their relief and amusement, the unlikely source of the SOS.

Kitten that dialled 999: Police traced call, smashed down the door...and found home-alone Bruce who had phoned the emergency number

The call had come from Bruce, a pedigree Singapura kitten, who had been left  indoors while the flat’s occupants were at work, and who had been pursuing his fascination with the house telephone and managed to call the emergency number as he pawed at it.

He was found by officers hiding in a wardrobe ‘looking very naughty’.

Last night owner James Cocksedge, 33, a sound engineer who lives with fiancée Monica de la Cruz, 36, told how he came home to find an officer waiting in his car outside his flat in north-west London – with the door hanging off its hinges.

‘The first thing he said to me was, “don’t worry the cat is fine”,’ he said, ‘and I knew then that Bruce was involved.

‘Since we had the landline installed Bruce always rushes to answer the phone when it rings. He’s also fascinated by the buttons, which he loves to press.’

He added: ‘The police officer then explained they’d received a 999 call from our address. Apparently a neighbour had let the officers in through the main door. She said she hadn’t noticed anything was amiss and that Monica and I were at work.

But the police said they couldn’t take any chances. I can only imagine they heard some suspicious scuffling through the door – which would have been Bruce having a spat with our other cat Audrey.

But it seems they didn’t want to take any chances.’ Mr Cocksedge says he doesn’t blame the police, who were called from Kentish Town station.

‘They were only doing their job,’ he added. ‘They did receive an emergency call from our address. For all they know something  really dangerous was going on in the flat.’

However, it has left him with a bills for several hundred pounds for a new front door.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman confirmed officers had been called to Mr Cocksedge’s flat on October 17.

‘A cat is referred to in the closing remarks of the record of police attendance at the address,’ he said.

‘The Metropolitan Police Service takes all abandoned calls made to police seriously.’
