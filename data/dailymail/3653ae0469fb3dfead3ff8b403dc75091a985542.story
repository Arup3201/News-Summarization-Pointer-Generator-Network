'Tore a tendon': PC Seymour says he spent four months in a cast after a 4am callout

A police officer is suing a burglary victim for £10,000 after allegedly falling into a drain while investigating a break-in.

PC Richard Seymour says he tore an Achilles tendon and spent four months in a cast after the fall during a 4am call-out to the man's shop in March last year.

The 34-year-old officer is now suing owner Stuart Lambley for 'loss of overtime' during his six-month absence from work – despite being on full pay throughout this time.

A letter from PC Seymour's lawyers 
adds that the officer also missed out on special duties during the 
London 2012 Olympics – something which came as a 'bitter disappointment'
to him.

Mr Lambley said: 'I was in complete shock when I received the letter last month.

'I won't be calling the police any 
more. I don't see the point. Not if there's a danger of getting sued. It
should not be allowed.'

The claim emerges just days after WPC 
Kelly Jones sparked public outrage and was criticised by her own chief 
constable for suing a burglary victim for £50,000. She claims she 
injured her leg and wrist after tripping over a kerb while investigating
at a petrol station in Thetford, Norfolk.

Mr Lambley, 36, who owns Maidenhead 
Aquatics in West Horsley, Surrey, branded PC Seymour's action, which is 
expected to seek £10,000, as 'disgusting'.

He added: 'He has signed up to be a police officer, he knows there is some risk involved.

'It's ridiculous and disgusting that a copper should think it is okay to sue someone who has called him for help.'

Last night Surrey Police Chief 
Constable Lynne Owens said the force did not support PC Seymour's action
and would investigate. She added the 'vast majority' of her officers 
would 'never consider making a private compensation claim against a 
victim of crime'.

Mr Lambley, who has been in the 
aquatics business for more than 20 years, said the burglary, in which 
his safe was broken into and property damaged, has already cost him more
than £2,000 in losses and repairs.

'We had a number of break-ins around 
that period and each time the police didn't catch anyone,' he added. 'On
this occasion, again no one was caught and instead I've been landed 
with this. He said he does not even know where PC Seymour fell and said 
officers had arrived at the property before him after responding to an 
automatic alarm.

He said: 'I saw him attempt to climb 
over the fence to get in. I saw that PC Seymour was hobbling a bit. But 
he didn't mention falling into a drain or a manhole.

'If he wants to try to climb over a fence then that's his business. The whole claim is ridiculous.'

PC Seymour's lawyers, London-based 
Slater & Gordon, claim Mr Lambley's business exposed him to a 
'foreseeable risk'. Their letter states: 'Our client fell into an open 
downpipe drain which was not covered at the time. It was extremely dark 
and our client didn't see the opening.'

It was not possible to reach PC 
Seymour, who lives in Old Basing, Hampshire, for comment last night but 
on Thursday he confirmed he had launched the action, adding: 'I'm 
waiting to hear something back.'

Surrey Police said it had supported 
his recovery and rehabilitation through its occupational health 
department since he was injured on March 28 last year.

It confirmed he remained on full pay and had returned to full duties since September.

Chief Constable Owens said: 'This is a private claim made by an officer and is not supported or funded by the force.'

As well as receiving treatment at a 
charity-funded police convalescent home and an NHS hospital, PC 
Seymour's lawyers claim he needed private chiropractic treatment. In a 
joint statement with the Police Federation they said: 'It is entirely 
wrong officers who sustain injuries through no fault of their own whilst
trying to protect the public should be singled out in this way.'

It is estimated that police officers pocket £20million a year in personal injury claims.
