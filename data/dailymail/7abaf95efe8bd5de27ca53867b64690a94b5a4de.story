Dreams of a white Christmas might just come true this year – with bookies slashing the odds on snow falling on December 25.

After a spell of spring-like weather this week, forecasters expect it to become progressively colder into next week and say snow on the big day is looking more and more likely.

And with only ten days to go, many punters are convinced. A final forecast by the Met Office is usually made about five days before Christmas, but bookmakers have already been swamped with bets.

Dreams of a white Christmas might just come true this year – with bookies slashing the odds on snow falling on December 25

One company, Coral, has cut the odds on a white Christmas to 4/7 anywhere in Britain, with Aberdeen the favourite at 3/1.

Spokesman Nicola McGeady said: ‘The Christmas spirit is alive in punters, who are queueing up to bet on a white Christmas in their local city. As December 25 nears, the odds on it actually happening continue to fall.’

Some weathermen are warning that the end of this week will herald the start of a long and cold winter, with signs of a severe big freeze on the cards.

Before that, however, this week will see rising temperatures with figures of 13C (55F) in some parts by Wednesday – almost double the average for the time of year.

The Met Office said westerly winds will bring a warm feel to southern parts of the country early this week.

Met Office forecaster Kirk Waite said: ‘From Monday morning it is going to be milder, although there is the risk of some rain and wintry showers to the North where it will be colder.

Snow: While temperatures rose to 7C in Scotland yesterday, part of the country is still under a foot of snow including Glenmore Forest (above)

‘The first real push of milder conditions is expected into Wednesday. This is due to a westerly pattern, though behind that it is again looking cooler.

‘Temperatures generally will be around average towards the weekend, and feeling more typical for the time of year.’

James Madden, forecaster for Exacta Weather, said a huge area of cold in the Atlantic Gulf Stream, which usually drives warmer air to our shores, threatens to trigger a particularly nasty winter.

‘Without the influence of this vital heat source, we can expect a horrific winter to develop with frequent blizzards, strong winds and extremely cold conditions across many parts of the country,’ he said.

However, thousands of families due to leave Britain for an Alpine skiing break next weekend are facing the prospect of a green Christmas.

Many resorts across the Alps and Pyrenees had already pushed back their opening weekends from December 6 to December 13 after warm temperatures caused early snowfall in November to melt across resorts in France, Austria and Italy.

But yesterday skiers at the French resort of Les Arcs, which makes up half of the giant Paradiski skiing domain, found green meadows or slopes dusted with just a light covering where inches of snow would usually have fallen by now. The resort’s daily ski report said the nearest fresh snow was 77 miles away.
