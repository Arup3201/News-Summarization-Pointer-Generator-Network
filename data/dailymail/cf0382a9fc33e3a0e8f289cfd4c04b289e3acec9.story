Missing: Schoolboy Anthony Stubbs, 16, went missing last month in Leyland, Lancashire amid reports of an argument with his girlfriend

The family of a school prefect who vanished only weeks after becoming a father aged just 16 has appealed for his safe return.

Anthony Stubbs went missing last month amid reports of an argument with his teenage girlfriend.

The schoolboy had intended to visit his mother's house but has not be seen or heard from since, despite it being only a ten minute walk away.

The Year 11 pupil at Wellfield Business and Enterprise College in Leyland, Lancashire, became a father when his girlfriend Charlotte Mason, 18, gave birth to their daughter Lily in September.

Anthony moved in with his girlfriend and child, despite concern from his family that the move could affect his schooling.

Police today issued CCTV pictures of the schoolboy, who is due to sit his GCSEs next year, showing him only moments before he vanished.

Anthony's mother Denise, 34, pleaded for her son's safe return, saying it would be the 'best Christmas present ever'.

She said: 'Christmas is a time for family and all I want is for Anthony to come home.

'It is his daughter Lily's first Christmas and his little brother Oscar is missing him too - he should be here to celebrate with his family.

'Having Anthony back would be the best Christmas present ever. I am not angry with him; I just want him back. Please just come home.'

She described his disappearance as 'really out of character' and said that her son had left home without his mobile phone or iPad.

Last sighting: CCTV images capture Anthony Stubbs before his disappearance. He is seen walking near the Seven Stars public house in Leyland on November 25 at 12:55pm

Safe return: Anthony's mother Denise pleaded for his return saying it would be the 'best Christmas present ever'

She said the ordeal had left his girlfriend 'devastated' and ruled out the possibility that the youngster had gone to stay with his father.

She added: 'Anthony is so caring and kind - he would never just leave without saying something, especially with his baby at home. He's such a brilliant dad and loved being father to little Lily.

'Him going missing is really out of character for him. He was last seen on CCTV footage walking out his house - he was coming to visit me but he never arrived. It's only a ten minute walk. He'd come visit me every day.

'He even went without his mobile and iPad- they're at his girlfriend's. We are so worried and have been putting posters up in different towns but we've had no response.

'He's not at his dad's either. I thought if he had a problem he would have been confident enough to tell us - that's why we can't understand it. He would have told us if he wanted to get away for a bit and said he was safe - and to stop making a fuss.

Anthony found out he was going to be dad when he was just 15 and had just celebrated his 16th birthday when Lily was born.

His last confirmed sighting was on November 25 at 12:55pm, walking with a schoolbag over his shoulder near to the Seven Stars public house in Leyland.

The day before he went missing Anthony failed to turn up at a ceremony where his grandparents were renewing their wedding vows.

Denise added: 'When Anthony didn't come to the ceremony, I thought it was because he was busy at home with the baby; I didn't want to interfere.

'But on Sunday at about 4pm his girlfriend sent me a text to ask me when he was going back home to her - and that's when we realised he was missing.

'I waited until it had been 24 hours and then went straight to the police station on Monday because I knew then that something had happened. All sorts of things are going through my mind. We just want him home.'

She added: 'He's very close with his cousin Katie and if he was thinking about running away I know he would have spoken to her about it.

'Nobody has heard from him, and we're just so worried. It's not in Anthony's heart to leave his family in this state. Anthony is such a caring person, he would help anyone out and he always looked out for other people before thinking about himself.

'He loves school and has got a baby girl and a girlfriend whom he adores and I just can't think of anything which would make him go. I don't believe he's run away. It's so out of character for him.'

Appeal: Police missing poster for Anthony Stubbs

'Even after he moved out, we still saw
him everyday. He would pick his brother Oscar up and take him to 
nursery every morning before he went off to school.

'Oscar's only three and he keeps asking me why Anthony hasn't been coming to see him and take him to nursery.

Out of character: Anthony's family became concerned when he missed a ceremony at which his grandparents were renewing their wedding vows

'His sister Jodie is a similar age to Anthony, she's 15, and he was so protective of her. She's trying to cope but she just misses him so much. His girlfriend Charlotte is devastated.'

Anthony's grandmother Maureen Jeffears, 53, said: 'Anthony has exams coming up but we think he was fine about them. I knew something was wrong when he didn't turn up to the ceremony on Saturday where we renewed our vows.

'We bought all our grandchildren a matching Cadbury purple tie but Anthony never came, even though he had been excited about it. His mother's fears for him are growing, she is in a bad way, but I am trying to keep positive.

'It is so out of character for him, he has never been missing before. He is a bright lad with a warm heart. Somebody knows where he is, please come forward so we can bring him home.'

Det Insp John Entwisle of Lancashire Police said: 'Anthony has not made any contact with either his friends or family which is very much out of character.

'He has a three month old baby at home who we know he must miss and our main aim is to locate Anthony safe and well, and bring him home to his family for Christmas.

'I would urge anyone who thinks they may have seen Anthony or might know where he is to come forward and contact police.'
