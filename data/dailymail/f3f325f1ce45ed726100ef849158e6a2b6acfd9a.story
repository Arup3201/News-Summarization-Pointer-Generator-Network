Tory welfare minister Lord Freud said he could not understand why people go to food banks

A Tory welfare minister is under fire for claiming it is ‘very hard to know why’ people go to food banks.

Lord Freud said nobody turned to charities for food parcels ‘willingly’ but could not understand what made them need help to feed their families.

Campaigners blame benefits cuts and the impact of the economic crisis for a sharp rise in the number of people using food banks in recent years.

More than half a million people across Britain have turned to food banks to stave off hunger, according to charities.

Ministers have previously argued that a surge in demand has in part been fuelled by jobcentre staff being allowed to refer the unemployed to food banks for help.

Cuts to benefits, frozen or falling wages and rising living costs have been blamed in part for some people struggling to make ends meet.

During a debate in the House of Lords, peers heard how changes to the welfare system meant more families were turning to food banks.

Labour’s Baroness Lister of Burtersett urged the government to estimate the ‘cost to family relationships of cuts to social security, which are forcing some families to move, breaking up their family and social relationships, and the cost to them of ever increasing punitive sanctions, which are driving more and more families to food banks’.

She added: ‘Both these trends are leaving families under more and more stress, leading, potentially, to the break-up of relationships.’

But Lord Freud said the rise in demand for food banks was difficult to understand. ‘Clearly nobody goes to a food bank willingly,’ he said.

‘However, it is very hard to know why people go to them.’

Charities argue that cuts to benefits and increasing use of sanctions mean more people have had to turn to food banks to feed their families

He pointed to a recent report by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs which showed there was a lack of systematic peer-reviewed research from the UK on the reasons or immediate circumstances that lead people to turn to food aid.

But Chris Mould, chairman of the Trussell Trust which runs 420 food banks, told the People: ‘I'm mystified by his remarks. We've kept statistics for the 14 years we've run food banks.

‘This gives a powerful answer why people are in need of them. It's related to benefit changes and low incomes.’

The Trussell Trust says 347,000 people used its food banks in December, compared with 26,000 a month five years ago.

Last year Tory Education Secretary Michael Gove sparked outrage when he claimed families become so poor they are forced to turn to food banks because of their own ‘decisions’,

He suggested that many cash-strapped families have brought their problems on themselves.

He added: ‘I appreciate that there are families who face considerable pressures.‘Those pressures are often the result of decisions that they have taken which mean they are not best able to manage their finances.

‘We need to ensure that support is not just financial, and that the right decisions are made.’
