Thirty brides shared their big day to make sure they got their fairy tale wedding in the snow.

The couples from China all said ‘I do’ among the snow and ice in the state of Chongqing, southwest China last weekend, a tradition which has become so popular that prospective bridal parties must go in a ballot to win a coveted slot.

With accommodation in short supply, newlyweds even resort to sleeping in tents in the cold conditions on their wedding night just to make the ceremony.

The ceremonies were inspired by the traditional ice and snow festivals held in the country near Siberian borders where locals create spectacular sculptures using their abundance of ice and snow.

Such an idyllic backdrop has become a big draw card for an increased number of couples wanting to tie the knot.

Most newlyweds set up camp on the ice field but do not seem to mind according to organisers.

Ceremony spokesman Kong Pai said: ‘I am sure it won’t be a problem for them to keep warm.’

The brides all wore dresses designed to look their best in the icy conditions. One bride even wore red because she wanted to stand out from the completely white backdrop.

Bride Wan Ts’ai said: ‘It’s wonderful to get married with so many people together and it will be our eternal memory of a wonderful day.’

Celebrating snow and ice is a popular winter tradition in China with festivals such as the Harbin Ice and Snow Festival in which spectacular ice statues are built each year. This year a remarkable tower - standing at about 20 storeys high – built entirely of ice was one of the main attractions as thousands of tourists flocked to the city of Harbin near the Russian border.

According to event organisers, 10,000 people were employed to complete hundreds of ice and snow sculptures at the event - some areas of which are already open to the public.

Some of the pieces measure more than 26 metres tall and 117 metres wide. Overall, the whole site is well over 600,000 sq metres.

In the evening, some of the structures are lit up in a beautiful light-show display with numerous palaces, towers and monuments in the festival lit up in every colour of the rainbow.

In the New Year, tourists can enjoy the artwork for themselves in addition to the Ice Lantern Garden Party, skiing, figure skating and theatre performances.
