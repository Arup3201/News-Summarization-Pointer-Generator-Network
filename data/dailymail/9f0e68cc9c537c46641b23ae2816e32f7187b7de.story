Rupert Murdoch offered $80billion to buy Time Warner, but was rebuffed by the company's board of directors, it has been revealed today

The 83-year-old Australian billionaire has his eye on the media conglomerate, which owns CNN, HBO, Warner Brothers, among other big-name media properties. Experts say he isn't likely to give up after one rejection.

The move could create a mega-sized media conglomerate that owns rights to dozens of popular TV shows and thousands of films, as well as cable TV networks and local broadcast TV channels.

Such a company would be a content provider powerful enough to aggressively negotiate with cable companies and internet service providers.

Gunning for them: Rupert Murdoch, the owner of Twenty-First Century Fox, is expected to ratchet up pressure on Time Warner until the company sells

Twenty-First
 Century Fox offered $85 per share in cash and stock for Time Warner, a 
source familiar with the situation told Reuters.

Time Warner's stock skyrocketed nearly 18percent early Wednesday to more than $84 a share after the New York Times broke the news.

Both sides confirmed that it had made the formal proposal to Time Warner last month.

'The Time Warner Board of Directors declined to pursue our proposal. We are not currently in any discussions with Time Warner,' Twenty-First Century Fox said in a statement on Wednesday.

On Wednesday morning, Time Warner issued a statement explaining why it had rejected the bid. It listed several reasons - though most revolved around the idea that Time Warner's companies were worth more than Murdoch had bid.

'The Board is confident that continuing to execute its strategic plan will create significantly more value for the Company and its stockholders and is superior to any proposal that Twenty-First Century Fox is in a position to offer,' the Board of Directors said in a statement.

Fox first approached Time Warner, owner of the Warner Bros. movie studio and cable channels such as HBO and CNN, in early June and delivered a formal takeover proposal later that month, the Times reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

Fox, which owns movie studio 20th Century Fox and cable news channel Fox News, offered to sell CNN as part of its proposal to buy Time Warner to clear any regulatory hurdles, the Times said.

'I think fair public value is $82. (It) would be good deal for Fox if it goes through Washington (regulators) with CNN sales,' Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan told Reuters in an email.

Time Warner's board discussed the proposal at length and sent a terse letter rejecting the offer earlier this month, saying that it was better off remaining independent, the newspaper said.

It said the deal fell through because the stock portion of Fox's offer consisted of non-voting shares.

Fox had estimated that a combined company would save $1 billion in costs and possibly more, primarily by cutting sales staff and back-office functions, the paper said.

The combined company's revenue would be over $60 billion.

Twenty-First Century Fox is in the middle of a reorganization of its television business as the network seeks to lift itself out of last place among the big U.S. broadcasters.

The shakeup of Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox's TV units also comes a year after the film and TV company was spun off from Murdoch's News Corp, which now operates publishing assets, including the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post, the Sun and Times of London in Britain and dozens of newspaper in Australia.

Twenty-First Century Fox is being advised by Goldman Sachs and Centerview Partners, while Time Warner has hired Citigroup and other advisers, the paper said.

Time Warner owns several major TV stations and movie studios. Its properties - in addition to CNN - include: New Line Cinema, HBO, Warner Bros., TBS, TNT, Cartoon Network, DC Comics, MLB Network and Castle Rock Entertainment.

Those assets would improve an impressive stable of media and entertainment properties already owned by Twenty-First Century Fox, including: 20th Century Fox movie studios, Fox News, local Fox TV stations in 18 markets, Fox Sports Network and the National Geographic Channel.

Time Warner once owned Time Warner Cable, the second-largest cable provider in the country, magazine publisher Time Inc., and AOL - though all three were spun off into independent companies.
