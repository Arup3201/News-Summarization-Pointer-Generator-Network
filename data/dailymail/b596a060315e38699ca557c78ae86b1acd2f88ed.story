Sam Michael is to leave his role as sporting director at McLaren at the end of the current campaign.

Michael has spent 21 years in Formula One, initially with Lotus and Jordan before joining Williams in 2001 as chief operations engineer.

The 43-year-old Australian was later promoted to technical director, a position he held for eight seasons before signing for McLaren.

Michael primarily concentrated on McLaren's trackside operations, but after just three seasons with the Woking-based marque he has opted to leave to return to Australia with his family.

A McLaren spokesperson confirmed: 'It is with great regret Sam is leaving the company.'

Michael tendered his resignation to McLaren Group CEO Ron Dennis in March, but agreed at the time to see out the season.

McLaren, meanwhile, have strongly refuted suggestions chief operating officer and acting CEO Jonathan Neale and technical director Tim Goss have been sacked.

Reports had surfaced this week suggesting Neale and Goss were on their way out of McLaren, but the spokesperson added: 'McLaren can categorically deny this to be the case.'
