Vice President Joe Biden publicly conceded on Wednesday what many critics of the Affordable Care Act have claimed: The federal government will end the Obamacare open enrollment period far short of its goal.

'We may not get to seven million; we may get to five or six, but that's a hell of a start,' Biden said during a speech in Minneapolis. 'I'm here to say thanks.'

The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that in order for the Obamacare system to avoid a financial 'death spiral,' at least 7 million Americans must enroll.

More importantly, the nonpartisan CBO projected that more than 2.7 million of them must be young Americans, whose limited use of health care services is expected to balance out the greater needs of older, sicker people.

The goal of 7 million new insurance customers has been embraced by members of Congress, the White House, and Health & Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.

Biden, shown earlier on Wednesday in Illinois, said the administration will fall far short of its Obamacare enrollment goal

Biden's appearance at Moose & Sadie's cafe, a brief stopover before a major Democratic fundraiser, marked the first time the Obama administration has walked back its health insurance enrollment goals by offering new numbers, although the independent CBO reset its estimate at 6 million this month.

Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, has softened the president's position in a different way during recent media briefings.

'When it comes to predictions about how many people will have signed up come March 31st, I don't have an exact number,' he said on February 12.

'What we are confident about is that that will be a large number, and it will be a population that is diverse enough to allow the marketplaces to function effectively.'

Last week the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced that total enrollment through January stood at 3.3 million, but the administration has refused to say how many of them have formalized their coverage by paying a first-month premium.

A MailOnline analysis of five states that do provide such numbers determined that just two-thirds of the total, or 2.2 million, are likely coverage by insurance.

White House press secretary Jay Carney has pivoted in recent weeks, focusing less on the total enrollment goal and more on the 'diversity' of enrollees needed to balance the system between the sick and the healthy

And a McKinsey & Company survey of more than 4,500 Obamacare enrollees in January found that just 11 per cent of them were uninsured before signing up.

About two-thirds of those surveyed said they were merely switching from employer-provided coverage.

Obamacare's original goal was to provide medical insurance for approximately 25 million uninsured Americans, out of the estimated 48 million who were uninsured in 2012.

So far, a large majority of those who have enrolled chose free Medicaid coverage rather than a private plan that would require a premium payment, a government subsidy, or both.

Biden, however, enjoys a concierge-style health plan provided by doctors in the U.S. Navy. And, he said Wednesday, he's taken full advantage of it.

'I've been a significant consumer of healthcare,' he told the crowd at the cafe, 'and I'm not bragging about it.'

While he was hospitalized for two brain aneurysms, he said, 'all I kept thinking about was, "Thank God I had all this insurance."'
