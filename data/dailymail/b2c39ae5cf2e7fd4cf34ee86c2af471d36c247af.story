The boo boys almost forced Rhys Priestland to call time on his international career two years ago but Warren Gatland has told the Wales fly-half to wave two fingers at his critics on Saturday.

Priestland was the target of yet more vitriol in the 33-28 defeat by Australia last weekend.

His second-half introduction was greeted by a chorus of jeers, harking back to 2012 when the level of abuse became so bad that the No 10 was reluctant to leave his flat and had to seek help from a sports psychologist.

L Williams (Scarlets); A Cuthbert (Cardiff Blues), S Williams (Scarlets), J Roberts (Racing Metro), G North (Northampton); R Priestland (Scarlets), M Phillips (Racing Metro); G Jenkins (Cardiff Blues, capt), S Baldwin (Ospreys), S Lee (Scarlets); B Davies (Wasps), L Charteris (Racing Metro); D Lydiate (unattached), J Tipuric (Ospreys), T Faletau (Newport Gwent Dragons). Subs: E Phillips (Scarlets), N Smith (Ospreys), R Jones (Scarlets), A-W Jones (Ospreys), J King (Ospreys), R Williams (Scarlets), J Hook (Gloucester), C Allen (Cardiff Blues).

But Wales coach Gatland has stood by the 27-year-old Scarlets playmaker, who was yesterday named in the starting line-up to face Fiji this Saturday. New Zealander Gatland made an impassioned defence of his player and urged Priestland to silence the doubters when he returns to the Millennium Stadium.

‘I suppose it’s part of sport now,’ said Gatland. ‘Tottenham got booed at the weekend, didn’t they?

‘You feel for Rhys a little bit because he’s been hammered on social media by certain sections. He is a confidence player and you hate to see it.

‘He’s a young man who at one stage contemplated giving the game away because it wasn’t worth taking that sort of personal criticism.

‘I thought he did pretty well when he came on at the weekend. I just hope he goes out, plays well and puts two fingers up to the section of the crowd that may have been booing him last week.

‘It’s something I don’t think we need in the game. We don’t always agree, but that’s the beauty of sport.

‘You disagree with someone and that’s fine, but you’d like to see there’s a bit of respect out there for people who are trying to do their best. He doesn’t go out there to put that jersey on and fail.’

A groin injury to Dan Biggar has given Priestland his opportunity in the Wales starting XV. The Scarlets No 10, who has 31 caps, offers better vision than Biggar, but has come under fire for his inconsistency and a tendency to make mistakes at key moments.

His promotion is one of eight changes to the starting line-up. Jonathan Davies, who is also a doubt to face the All Blacks next week, and Leigh Halfpenny are both sidelined, but the return to fitness of centre Scott Williams has allowed George North to switch back to his preferred position on the wing.

Liam Williams moves to full-back and veteran Mike Phillips comes in to complete a new-look half-back combination, with utility man James Hook providing cover from the bench.

Hook’s international career was in doubt after his omission from last month’s 34-man squad, but the 29-year-old Gloucester man was recalled on Sunday evening. Leicester’s Owen Williams and Bath’s Gavin Henson were also available, but Gatland saw Hook as the ideal candidate.

‘I didn’t consider Gavin at all,’ said Gatland. ‘Owen’s been playing a bit at 12, but hasn’t been playing a lot at 10. We’ve been watching James and his game has improved for Gloucester. He gives us some versatility. It’s quite hard to integrate a new No 10 that quickly so, for us, it was a logical decision.

‘We had spoken to the coaches about things we wanted James to work on and concerns that we’d had before selection. We were concerned with how lateral he was. We wanted him to attack the line a bit more and be a lot squarer.

Gatland said that he did not consider brining Gavin Henson (above) in to the squad 

Captain Sam Warburton (centre) will be rested by Gatland for the Test against Fiji on Saturday

‘He has been working on that aspect and that’s made a difference to him and Gloucester.’

There are also wholesale changes to the forwards and Hook’s Gloucester team-mate, Richard Hibbard, is replaced at hooker by Scott Baldwin. Gethin Jenkins comes off the bench to captain the side and is joined in the tight-five by Bradley Davies and Luke Charteris, of Wasps and Racing Metro.

Sam Warburton is rested to give Justin Tipuric a run at openside, completing the back-row alongside Dan Lydiate and Toby Faletau.

The forwards will look to dominate the set-piece against their World Cup group opponents, who Gatland believes will be at their most dangerous when they get the ball out wide.

‘They’ve got some quality finishers,’ he said. ‘We’re giving them an opportunity to play on a fast ground with the roof closed, which will suit their ball carriers and their offloading ability.

‘They always manage to do something out of the ordinary and I think that will add to the spectacle.’

‘They are a side that have perhaps put a bit more emphasis into their sevens campaigns, but they’re going to be tough. We’ve got to have the confidence and self-belief that we’re good enough to handle their threats and put them away to win comfortably.’
