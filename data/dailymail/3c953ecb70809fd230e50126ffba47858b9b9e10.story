England batsman Sam Robson has signed a new deal with Middlesex which will keep him with the county until the end of 2016 at least.

The announcement comes ahead of a key winter for Robson, who will head off with the England Lions knowing his place at the top of his country's order is under threat.

Yorkshire pair Alex Lees and Adam Lyth are also touring and after averaging just over 30 throughout the English summer, Robson's place alongside Alastair Cook is likely to be tested.

His county future is more than secure, though, with Middlesex rewarding the 25-year-old who joined them in 2008 after leaving Australia, the country of his birth.

He has scored almost 4,000 runs for them at an average of more than 40.

'I am delighted to sign a new contract with Middlesex, especially after what has been an incredible 12 months for me,' Robson said.

'After scoring five centuries in six matches for the EPP and the Lions earlier in the year and then scoring my maiden Test century in my second Test, I am looking forward to building on this and am sure my best is yet to come.

Robson is bowled out for 19 runs playing for England against Sri Lanka in June 2014

'I am very grateful for the support Middlesex have given me over the last seven years and look forward to continuing my career with this great club.'

Middlesex's director of cricket, Angus Fraser, was equally pleased.

'I am naturally delighted that Sam continues to commit himself to Middlesex CCC. He is the sort of player any club would want to build their future around and we always enjoy having him in our team,' he said.

'During the past four years he has developed in to a high quality cricketer and his consistent performances for Middlesex CCC were rightly rewarded with selection for England's Test side.

'Everyone at the club is extremely proud of the fact that Middlesex has helped develop another England cricketer and the supporters of both these teams can look forward to him scoring lots of runs for them in the future.'
