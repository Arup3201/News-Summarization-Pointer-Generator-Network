The mother of Kelsey Dawn Raffaele, the 17-year-old driver who died in a car crash while talking on her cell phone, is praising the bi-partisan legislation passed in Michigan on Friday to ban cell phone use by beginner drivers.

Bonnie Raffaele said she is 'deeply grateful' that Republicans and Democrats reached across the aisle to pass 'Kelsey's Law' before the end of the legislative session.

Loss: Kelsey Dawn Raffaele, in 2009, was killed in a crash in 2010 when she was chatting on her cell phone while driving

The devastated mother launched a mission to prevent the tragedy she experienced when her teenage daughter was killed on a winter morning in 2010. She had been chatting on her cell phone when driving home from a friend's house.

Raffaele said she won a bittersweet victory when the Michigan Legislature passed a bill prohibiting young novice drivers from using a cell phone while behind the wheel.

Kelsey was a Level 2 driver when she 
crashed. She had just passed a slower-moving vehicle on a slippery road 
near her high school and went too far to the right, clipping a snow 
bank, her mother said. She apparently overcompensated by jerking the 
wheel to the left and veered into an oncoming car.

'She was on the phone. It was a 
classic case of a distracted driver,' said Bonnie Raffaele, a computer 
technician for the Eastern Upper Peninsula Intermediate School District.

Still grieving a year later, she 
chatted with a friend who was a state police officer. 'I guess I was at 
the angry point. I said, 'Something has to be done. I have to get to the
kids. They have to pay attention and stop this.''

The measure, which at one point appeared in trouble because of opposition from House Speaker Jase Bolger, won final approval a few hours before lawmakers adjourned in December. Thirty-two states have similar laws.

Gov. Rick Snyder said on Friday he was 'generally supportive' of what officially would be known as 'Kelsey's Law.'

'I will most likely end up signing it. The concept is a good one,' Snyder said during a year-end news conference, noting that he also has a 16-year-old daughter named Kelsey, who got her license last summer.

The next step, Raffaele said, will be spreading the word to parents, police, teachers and anyone else in a position to make a difference - especially teens themselves.

'I'm a firm believer that nobody 
should be on the phone when they're driving, but my big concern is the 
kids,' said Raffaele, 48, who lives in the Upper Peninsula town of Sault
Ste. Marie.

'They're the most vulnerable, the most inexperienced.'

The
bill applies to holders of Level 1 licenses, who must be accompanied by
a parent, guardian or another licensed driver at least 21 years old, 
and those with Level 2 licenses, who can drive alone with some limits on
hours and carrying young passengers. It exempts Level 3 drivers, who 
have full privileges.

32 states have already enacted laws banning cell phone use for teen drivers.

With her husband, Ron, Raffaele 
created a website devoted to warning teens of the danger. She hit the 
road, speaking at schools as far away as Grand Rapids. And she enlisted 
state Sen. Howard Walker, a Traverse City Republican whose district 
includes the Sault Ste. Marie area, to sponsor the cell phone 
legislation.

'I am so excited, so relieved,' said a grateful Raffaele.

While
savoring the outcome, she continues to struggle with the loss of 
Kelsey, whose twin sister, Courtney, is a student at Northern Michigan 
University in Marquette.

'To
this day, I find myself thinking she's still at a friend's house,' 
Raffaele said. 'It's just ... disbelief. You just never expect to bury 
your child.'
