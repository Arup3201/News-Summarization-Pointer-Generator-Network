Heat was the story in Game 1 of the NBA Finals.

Not the Miami Heat, so much, as literal heat as the air conditioning malfunctioned in the San Antonio arena.

With temperatures measured in the
 mid-80s inside the arena, Game 1 of the title series between Miami and 
the San Antonio Spurs was a sweltering struggle.

Players tried to cool 
by placing icebags on their necks while resting on the bench, and just 
about everyone in the sellout crowd was using something to fan 
themselves.

Sweltering temperature in the arena without air conditioning were so bad Lebron James was benched for the game's final minutes

'It's just a bad 
situation,' Spurs coach Gregg Popovich told ABC's Doris Burke during an 
interview before the fourth quarter.

Moments earlier, Burke reported 
that a hand-held thermometer placed near the playing surface measured 
the air temperature at 88 degrees.

It's
 not the first time electricity has had a significant impact on a 
championship event in recent years. The Super Bowl in 2013 between 
Baltimore and San Francisco was marred by a power outage at the 
Superdome in New Orleans, interrupting play for 34 minutes.

Power was the culprit in Game 1 of the finals as well, arena officials said.

'An
 electrical failure for the power that runs the AC system in the 
AT&T Center has occurred,' Spurs Sports and Entertainment said in a 
statement distributed in the second half. 'We are continuing to work on 
resolving the problem. We apologize for any inconvenience.'

Many
 fans removed the giveaway black T-shirts handed out before the game, 
obviously wanting to wear as few layers inside the steamy building as 
possible.

Heat star LeBron James was clearly laboring in the second 
half.

He was even benched for the final few minutes and had to be helped off court back to the locker room.

'They're trying to smoke us out of here,' he told teammates during one stoppage in play.

Neither
 team was scheduled to practice at the arena on Friday or Saturday 
because of a previously scheduled concert. Game 2 is Sunday night in San
 Antonio.

The Spurs, helped by 21 points and 10 rebounds from Tim Duncan, outscored Miami 36-17 in the fourth quarter to pull away.

James,
 who finished with 25 points, said: 'After I came out of the game, they 
kind of took off. It was frustrating sitting out and not be able to help
 our team.'

Spurs point guard Tony Parker started the game despite injury fears, and he scored 19 points with eight assists.

Manu Ginobili once again led San Antonio’s impressive bench output, scoring 18 points and 11 rebounds.

'It
 was tough on both teams,' Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. 'They were 
pretty dead. We tried to get guys in and out... it was really hot out 
there.’

For Miami,
 Dwyane Wade chipped in with 19 points, but their hard work was undone 
by a fats finish from the Spurs to turn the game around.

The Heat had led 78-74 heading into fourth and were 86-79 ahead with 9:38 remaining after a four-point play from Chris Bosh.

The final score came out with the Heat trailing 95-110.

But it was San Antonio who had the last laugh to strike first in the series.

'Obviously,
 tonight we would've loved to have him in there to finish the game, but 
we've got to finish the game better,' Wade said.

Game two takes place in San Antonio on Sunday.
