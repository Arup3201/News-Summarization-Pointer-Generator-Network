Nestled in the Somerset countryside and protected by soundproof fencing, neighbours say it looks like a holiday park.

But this £1.6million caravan site has been built by a council to provide a permanent home for just eight traveller families.

The facility, Carrswood View, is on the site of a previous unauthorised and run-down camp near Bath. 

Bath's first permanent gipsy camp, which cost £1.6million to build, is due to open next month and contains eight permanent pitches 

The site contains eight permanent pitches and five which are designated 'transit' sites for people who are just passing through the area 

Each of the pitches have been built to house a utility unit, which contains washing facilities (left) and space for furniture (right) 

Retired engineer Michael Parr, 69, said: ‘It’s a lot of money to lavish on people who travel around. It’s like a holiday camp.’ Another local said: ‘Don’t think I’ll bother paying to go to Center Parcs or Butlins any more!’

The site has five ‘transit’ pitches for short stays and eight permanent plots with a living room, sanitary facilities, a patio and parking for two caravans and two cars.

Because it is in the green belt, the units are clad in wood with grass roofs so they blend in. Soundproof fencing will cut down noise from a nearby road and railway. The build, by Elim Housing, cost £1.62million – with £870,000 of council cash and £750,000 from central government.

Allan Perrin, 64, has lived nearby for 25 years. He said: ‘It is a vast improvement but the question is could it have been done cheaper?’ 

Carrswood View has been developed on the site of an illegal encampment in Bath which had become run-down and full of rubbish 

The illegal site was full of discarded rubbish and gas canisters, and councillors hope the new development will give them more control 

Each utility unit has been built in wood and have a roof which will be covered in grass to minimise the impact of the green belt development

Tim Warren, of the opposition Tory group on Bath and North East Somerset Council, said: ‘It’s absolutely beautiful, however, is this the best use of taxpayers’ money? I’m also not convinced this is the final figure. When we first had meetings around this, costs were estimated at over £2million.’

Gypsy Council chairman Joseph P Jones said it was a lot to spend – and it would have been cheaper to let the travellers build their own housing. He said: ‘The majority of new provision comes from the gipsy and traveller community itself, and because it is built by us and owned by us, it costs the council nothing and is generally better looked after.’ Residents of Carrswood View will pay £105 a week rent and £963.40 a year council tax, with 11 applicants hoping to move in next month.

Council leader Paul Crossley said having a dedicated gipsy site made it easier to clear illegal camps. The council is in the process of making £30million of cuts over three years. 

The utility unit for each pitch contains sinks, electricity points and running water, as well as room for kitchen equipment to be installed 

Finishing touches are being made to fences and driveways for each of the pitches, to give the maximum possible facilities for families 

Developers have been making the final finishing touches to the site, which is expected to open officially next month
