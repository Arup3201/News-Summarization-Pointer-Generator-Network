Head coach Stuart Lancaster insists there will be no radical alterations to England's approach in the autumn Tests despite the presence of innovative attack coach Brian Ashton at the squad's preparation camp this week.

Ashton, the former Bath, England and Ireland head coach, was invited to England's base in Surrey on Monday and Tuesday so Lancaster and his coaching team can benefit from his experience.

'I don't want to create something that's not there,' Lancaster said.

'It's for me to sit down and chat. Different ideas, different perspective.

'He's developed a lot of players, but actually he's developed a lot of coaches. He's somebody I've always stayed in contact with.

'He's a very creative attacking coach (but) we're not going to change anything we're not already doing.

'I think the way in which we try and play the game will remain the same.'

The 68-year-old Ashton, now coaching Lancaster-based Vale of Lune in the North One West division, coached England to the 2007 World Cup final and Lancaster knows his side need to develop if they are to beat reigning world champions New Zealand in the opening international of the season on November 8.

'In terms of our attacking mindset, I think we've always had a strong one,' Lancaster said.

'We need to beat New Zealand by scoring tries as well as kicking points.'

The All Blacks are the first opponents of an autumn schedule which sees South Africa (November 15), Samoa (November 22) and Australia (November 29) - opponents in Pool A at the 2015 World Cup - visit Twickenham.

Luther Burrell is the biggest fitness concern due to a hand injury the Northampton centre suffered playing against the Ospreys.

Lancaster conceded Burrell, who met a specialist on Tuesday following a scan, is unlikely to face the All Blacks.

Lancaster, who revealed the prognosis was more encouraging than first feared and that surgery would not be required, said: 'He's not been in camp this week at all. He's still in the equation further down the line. He's definitely not out the series.

'Potentially he could come back into camp next week, but he won't have done any of the work. It would be a big step to put him in (against New Zealand).'

England's other wounded players - Harlequins prop Joe Marler (quad), Saracens number eight Billy Vunipola (concussion), Kyle Eastmond (ribs), Harlequins wing Marland Yarde (ankle), Wasps back row James Haskell (virus) and Bath prop David Wilson (calf) - are expected to play a full part in training from next Monday at the latest.

Lancaster is pleased with the opportunity to work with his players for a lengthy duration.

'It means that if players are required to come in, they are up to speed straight away,' he added.

The All Blacks and other touring opposition have been entwined in international camps for some time, but Lancaster insists his squad's knowledge-base has developed from every spell as a group since his appointment in early 2012.

'The All Blacks, the South Africans, since the Super Rugby final, have been in camp - that's a 2.5 months camp,' Lancaster said.

'Their cohesion and understanding of their structures would be enhanced.

'But you could argue it the other way: they are at the end of a long, hard season and we are fresh at the start of ours.

'We have been together now for 2.5 years; every time we return, we are at the point we left because the players remember and we don't have to go back to square one.

'We are another level up to this time last year. Mainly because the players are similar - consistency in selection.

'Whilst the starting XV changes, generally the group is the same faces.'

Lancaster knows this autumn is about a fine balance - giving his fringe players the Test experience they need while developing a winning mentality and a momentum which he wishes to take into World Cup year.

'You don't want to compromise your team because ultimately it comes down to winning,' Lancaster added.

The pivotal fly-half position provokes a challenge as Saracens' Farrell has just returned from a thigh problem and Bath's George Ford is keen to get a chance to claim the number 10 jersey.

Farrell has 26 caps and Ford two, while Stephen Myler has one, and Lancaster could provide a chance for the less experienced pair.

'George has now established himself there (in the Premiership), so the next step is to get him those international caps,' Lancaster said.

Sam Burgess is soon to be a team-mate of Ford's at The Rec having made a high-profile transfer from rugby league.

Lancaster is not about to meddle in his imminent arrival to union, adding: 'I'm sure he'll have one eye on our games, but I think he'll need to get bedded in at Bath.'
