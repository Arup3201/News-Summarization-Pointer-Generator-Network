As far as uninspired car names go, it is up there with the Ford Ka if not quite the Toyota Deliboy.

Vauxhall has announced that its upcoming three-door hatchback will be called Adam.

Previously known as Junior and designed to rival the Mini and Fiat 500, the vehicle will make its public debut at the Paris Motor Show in September.

While the car's straightforward name will leave many British drivers bemused, the moniker will have more of a resonance with German motorists.

Vauxhall cars are branded as Opel on the continent, a company founded by Adam Opel.

General Motors, which owns Vauxhall, calls its German business Adam Opel AG so the name of its new compact car will resonate with local drivers.

Back in Britain, meanwhile, the name is almost certain to be met with a snigger.

Adam, which is due to go on sale in early 2013, is a four-seat vehicle that is approximately 3.7m long - roughly the same length as a Mini hatchback.

The 'muscular and stylish' car is expected to have a starting price of £10,000 so will be similar in cost to the Fiat 500.

It will have a newly-developed 1.0-litre, three-cylinder engine and is due to be fully-customisable.

An insider told Auto Express: 'There are around 10,000 different variants of paint and interior trim - you won’t see two alike on the road.'
