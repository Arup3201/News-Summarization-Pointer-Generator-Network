They reached the FA Cup quarter-final under the radar - escaping attention with victories over Huddersfield, Cardiff and Derby County in the early rounds.

Next month a convey of cars and buses will make the 37-mile trip down the M4 to watch Steve Clarke’s team play the mighty Arsenal in an FA Cup semi-final. Reading are back on the map now.

This was a brutal destruction by The Royals, as close as it comes to a complete tactical masterclass at this level of the game. They were ruthless against Bradford.

Good for Clarke and his assistant Kevin Keen, the men who controversially changed all 11 players for their 4-1 defeat at Watford last Saturday. Who will remember that score now?

‘We sneaked in under the radar, but I’ll be more excited about an FA Cup semi-final nearer the time,’ revealed a dead-pan Clarke.

It was hardly champagne popping stuff, but that is Clarke’s nature after a coaching career that has also taken him to Newcastle, Chelsea and West Brom. He left the celebrations to the fans.

By the end this place was raucous, with jubilant Reading supporters spilling on to the pitch at the final whistle.

A spine-tingling opening ten minutes had seen a goal from former Arsenal trainee Hal Robson-Kanu and another from winger Garath McCleary put Reading in command.

Jamie Mackie’s strike in the 68th minute was reward for his endeavour, a fabulous finish after locking on to Nathaniel Chalobah’s delayed pass.

By then Bradford were down to ten men, chasing shadows after Filipe Morais was sent off for raking his studs down the body of Chalobah. Silly boy.

The sharpest minds were in Reading’s team, with the soothing voice of captain Alex Pearce at the back containing and nullifying the threat of Jon Stead and James Hanson.

On a night like this you have to feel for Bradford’s fans, delayed in traffic for hours on the way to the Madejski Stadium. In the end Phil Parkinson’s team never got out of first gear.

‘Are you Chelsea in disguise?’ sang Bradford’s fans, hoping beyond hope for a comeback similar to the one they experienced at Stamford Bridge last month.

It was there that they beat Barclays Premier League leaders Chelsea 4-2, recording one of the greatest FA shocks of all time. They needed one more super-human effort, calling on Gary Liddle, Billy Knott, Stead and Hanson to provide the resistance against this rampant Reading team. They could not cope.

Reading went in front after six minutes and it is here that the romance begins for Robson-Kanu as he prepares to play his former club on the game’s biggest stage.

The winger was released from Arsenal in 2004, the year the Invincibles went an entire season unbeaten on the way to clinching the Premier League title.

The games will be played over the weekend of April 18 and 19. 

Here nobody could touch Robson-Kanu and he beat Bradford captain Stephen Darby at the near post to put Reading in front with a terrific header from eight yards.

The place erupted as Reading took control. Three minutes later they scored again.

McCleary darted in from the right and when his shot took a deflection off the leg of Andy Halliday, the ball looped beyond the hands of Bradford keeper Ben Williams.

It shattered Parkinson’s dreams, his formation splintered by the class of Danny Williams and Chalobah in the centre of Reading’s midfield.

Next month’s semi-final is another chance to shine, as Clarke prepares for Wembley’s wide open spaces with a team that is tactically cute and comfortable in possession.

Reading have been to Wembley for play-off finals, but it is 88 years since they played in an FA Cup semi-final.

This is Arsenal’s specialist competition — winning the trophy five times under Arsene Wenger and making Wembley a second home. When the Royals arrive, they will deserve the red carpet treatment.
