Anna Soubry said she was 'obsessed' by Kim Kardashian

Kim Kardashian is ‘the most appalling role model’ for young women, a top Tory has claimed.

Defence minister Anna Soubry said she was ‘obsessed’ by the US celebrity because of her body.

But she insisted the reality TV star, who ‘broke the internet’ with a series of fully nude photos last month, did not have a ‘normal body’ which ordinary women could aspire to.

Miss Soubry’s remarks came in an outspoken interview on BBC Radio 4’s PM programme this evening in which she also hinted that David Cameron was preying on people’s prejudices over immigration

Admitting she has never read a political book, she said: ‘The big downside of my life is that I don’t have enough time to read.

‘At the moment, I work such long hours I don’t even have the time to read the paper that I’ve downloaded on my iPad in the morning. I do try to read because I am obsessed with Kim Kardashian.’

She then added: ‘I think she’s the most appalling role model. Somebody who young women aspire to. In my opinion, that is not a normal body.’

A Tory minister – who describes herself as a feminist and a ‘tough old bird’ – also risked an angry backlash from Conservative colleagues by raising concerns about the Prime Minister’s planned crackdown on EU immigration.

Miss Soubry’s remarks said she wanted to know why the Prime Minister had decided to pledge a benefit crackdown on European workers.

She said the government should not be ‘pandering’ to the view of parties such as Ukip, and warned there was a risk of ‘playing to people’s prejudices’.

The Prime Minister announced last month that he wanted to stem the flow of European migration by cutting in-work tax credits for EU migrants until they have paid taxes in the UK for four years.

But Miss Soubry questioned whether people were really coming over here to sign on to benefits, asking: ‘Is that the real problem?’

The comments highlight on-going differences in Conservative ranks over Europe and immigration following the party’s abject failure to meet its promise to cut net migration to the tens of thousands.

Two weeks ago, figures showed that net migration had risen 78,000 over the past year to 260,000 – well above the 244,000 in 2010 and fuelled mainly by incomers from the EU.

In a major speech the day after the embarrassing figures were released, Mr Cameron unveiled plans to deny in-work benefits for EU workers for four years. These hand-outs top up low wages and are seen as a key ‘pull factor’ for incomers to Britain.

Ms Soubry questioned Mr Cameron’s insistence that benefits were drawing people to the UK – when what migrants were really interested in was jobs.

‘I want to know and understand why my Prime Minister who I have huge amounts of respect for, I genuinely do, I think has done an outstanding job, I want to know why he’s come to that conclusion,’ she said.

‘Is that the real problem, that people might be able to claim benefits?

‘There’s a danger that you create false fear and sometimes you play to people’s prejudices.’

She added: ‘It’s really important that we make it clear that the majority of people who come to our country come here to work these are good people.

‘Just because some people have a particular view, doesn’t mean to say that you should pander to it. I think we’ve got to be very, very clear about all of this. We’re obsessing about it.

‘The biggest issue in my constituency, it’s absolutely key marginal, is not immigration, it is the economy. The economy will determine the next election.’

Asked about Miss Soubry’s comments on Mr Cameron’s benefits crackdown, a Downing Street spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister has set out a very clear plan to control migration from within the EU.’

It is not the first time Ms Soubry has made a controversial intervention. Last year she said on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show that Ukip leader Nigel Farage looked as though he has ‘a finger up his bottom’.

Asked about the gaffe on PM, she said she ‘almost forgot that people were actually watching it’.

The defence minister also had a run-in with Mr Farage on Question Time, when she told him: ‘You do not talk facts; you talk prejudice’.

Yesterday she said that many people had rung her up to complement her on how she had tackled the Ukip leader. Among those who rang her, she said, was Lynton Crosby, the Prime Minister’s Australian strategy chief.

In the interview she adopted a broad Australian accent as she spoke about a phone call she had received from Mr Crosby.

‘The next day, my mobile went. I got: “it’s Lynton Crosby here… yeah, what you said last night, absolutely brilliant”. And I said: “Oh wow, great, thanks Lynton”.

‘The other person who rang me… I was in the pub… you see one of these “caller unknown” you think, who is this?

‘You get this “Oh it’s Downing Street switchboard here, could you hold the line”. I thought, “Oh my Lord, who is this?”.

‘I rushed outside, and it was the boss, it was David Cameron, saying, “What you said last night… absolutely”.’

She went on: ‘The next person who said something… Oh I can’t tell you that, I’ll probably get into trouble. It was Ed Miliband who actually came up to me the next night and said it was the right thing to say. And it was. We mustn’t ever forget that.’
