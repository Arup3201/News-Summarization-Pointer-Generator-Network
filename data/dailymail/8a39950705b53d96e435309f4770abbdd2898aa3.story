Tough: Home Secretary Theresa May will push ahead with plans to 'deport first and hear an appeal later'

Banks will be forced to carry out background checks to stop illegal immigrants opening accounts.

The proposal – one of several in the long-awaited Immigration Bill – would force managers to check potential customers against a database of foreigners known to be in the country illegally.

Applicants for a driving licence would also have to prove they were in Britain legally. Those who are unable to do so would be turned down.

Ministers said the law would stop 
illegal immigrants using public services and discourage them from coming
to Britain in the first place.

The
stricter rules follow elements of the Bill already announced, such as 
requiring private landlords to check the immigration status of tenants.

Temporary
migrants, such as foreign students, would also have to make a 
contribution to the NHS before they could use GP and hospital services, 
following concerns about the cost of  health tourism to the taxpayer.

However, ministers are thought to have dropped a proposal to make GPs check the immigration status of new patients.

Home
Secretary Theresa May will push ahead with plans to ‘deport first and 
hear an appeal later’ in cases involving foreign criminals, terrorists 
and illegal immigrants.

Mrs
May told BBC News: 'I think most members of the public - if you’re 
working hard - you want to know that people who are being given access 
to rented accommodation to various other public services, to things like
bank accounts and driving licences, you want to say "well, hang on a 
minute - if they’re here illegally, if they have no right to be here in 
the UK, why is it that people are able to have access to these things?".

'Surely the Government should do something about it, and that is exactly what we’re doing.'

She went on: 'Crucially,
in the Bill what we’ll be doing is addressing the issue that people get
fed up when they feel that people are able to come into the country and
access the health service without having contributed to it.

'So we will be asking for a surcharge
- there’ll be a sort of levy on people who are going to be coming here 
to be staying for a while to contribute so that people can feel it’s 
fair that actually people are being asked to contribute to public 
services such as the NHS.'

The proposal would force bank managers to check potential customers against a database of foreigners known to be in the country illegally

The shake-up of immigration law will let the Government remove dangerous migrants from the country while their cases proceed instead of having to let them remain in Britain for years during their appeal.

In addition, the list of grounds for appeal will be slashed from 17 to just four.

This is a response to the debacle of the deportation of Abu Qatada, who was flown home to Jordan in July after a 12-year legal battle.

It is expected to cut the 68,000 cases lodged against the Government every year by more than half.

The Bill will also:

Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: ‘The Bill will stop migrants using public services to which they are not entitled, reduce the factors which encourage people to come to the UK and make it easier to remove people who should not be here.

‘We welcome the brightest and best migrants who want to contribute to our economy and society.

‘Hard-working people deserve an immigration system that is fair to British citizens and legitimate migrants and tough on those who abuse the system and flout the law.’

Net migration has been cut by a third since 2010 but ministers fear a voter backlash if thousands of Romanians and Bulgarians come to Britain when border controls end in 2014.

David Hanson, Labour's shadow immigration minister, said: 'Theresa May has a history of promising big and pretending all is well, but the Government is continuing to fail on immigration policy.

'This Government is still failing on immigration even on its own measures, with net migration now going up again rather than being in the tens of thousands as the Prime Minister promised.'
