The head of the International Monetary Fund warned today of a 'looming collapse in global demand' that would pitch world economies into a new recession.

The comments of IMF chief Christine Lagarde came on the day that money markets and investors experienced their worst day for three years.

She told politicians and leading economists in Washington that urgent action must be taken, alluding to 'dark clouds over Europe and hug uncertainty in the United States'.

She added: 'The actions I am calling for today are not for the coming years – they are for the coming months.'

The Dow Jones today finished its worst week since the depths of the financial crisis in 2008, as hundreds of ‘Occupy Wall Street’ demonstrators continue an Egyptian-style protest in New York.

All three U.S. stock markets finished
slightly up on Friday - but it hasn't erased a torrid week in which the
Dow plunged 6.4 per cent, the S&P 500 dropped 6.6 per cent and the Nasdaq fell 5.3 per cent.

The further falls this morning - before a
small recovery later on - were despite finance ministers from the 
world's leading economies pledging to take whatever steps are necessary 
to calm the markets.

Film-maker Michael Moore is backing the 'Occupy Wall Street' protest and said it is best to sort out economic problems without riots.

'The smart rich know they can only build the gate so high,' he told Current TV.

'Sooner or later history proves that people when they have had enough are not going to take it anymore.

'Much better to deal with it non-violently now, through the political system, than what could possibly happen in the future, which nobody wants to see.'

The Dow Jones finished up 38 points, 
or 0.35 per cent, at 10,771.48. The S&P was up 6.84 points, or 0.61 
per cent, at 1,136.40, and the Nasdaq was up 27.56 points, or 1.12 per 
cent, at 2,483.23.

'I'd have been happier to see the market up 100 points or so,' said Doreen Mogavero, of Mogavero, Lee & Co. 'However, in these rather cautious times people are a little hesitant to commit in a big way.'

The primary trigger for the rebound came from policymakers suggesting additional steps will be taken to support Europe's financial system - such as the European Central Bank adding more liquidity.

But billionaire investor George Soros 
claims the U.S. is already into a double-dip recession and this is down 
to political squabbling and GOP opposition to President Obama’s stimulus
proposals.

‘There was a deal in the making which 
would have balanced the budget over the long term, but would have 
allowed short-term fiscal stimulus, which would have been the right 
policy,’ Mr Soros told CNBC.

He echoed comments from World Bank 
President Robert Zoellick by saying the situation in Europe is ‘more 
dangerous’ to the global economy than when Lehman Brothers went down in 
2008.

Markets in Asia and Europe also fell 
and Moody's downgraded eight Greek banks over rising concerns about a 
possible Greek default, which would threaten banks holding billions in 
Greek debt.

The groom was also reflected by a number of warnings by world leaders. Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne yesterday said the global economy had just six weeks to save the euro.

That is when 
leaders of the G20 group of leading countries will meet for crunch talks
in France.

Mr Osborne said:  'Patience is running out in the 
international community. There is a sense from across the leading lights
of the eurozone that time is running out for them.

'The eurozone has six weeks to resolve this political crisis.'

'There was a deal in the making which 
would have balanced the budget over the long term, but would have 
allowed short-term fiscal stimulus, which would have been the right 
policy'

Just after Wall Street opened today, the
Dow Jones was down 36, or 0.3 per cent, at 10,698; the S&P was down
3 points, or 0.2 per cent, at 1,127; and the Nasdaq was down 2, or 0.1 
per cent, at 2,454.

Two markets had fought back by 1pm Eastern Time, with the Nasdaq up 0.5 per cent, or 12 points, to 2,467; and the S&P up 0.2 per cent, or 2 points, to 1,131. But the Dow was trading down 0.2 per cent, or 17 points, to 10,717.

Protesters have been occupying nearby public square Zuccotti Park and are demonstrating against what they claim is the greed of U.S. financial organisations and workers.

In Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 plunged
below the important 5,000 mark by lunchtime as it dropped by 1.3 per 
cent to 4,977, before later recovering.

France's
CAC-40 closed up 1 per cent at 2,810 while the DAX in Germany rose 0.6 
per cent to 5,197. The FTSE 100 ended 0.5 per cent higher at 5,067.

Asian
shares continued to fall sharply, with South Korea's Kospi index 
posting a whopping 5.7 per cent decline as banking chaos and probes into
illegal dealing gripped the country.

The disastrous opening came after the 
Dow Jones plunged to a year low mid-trading yesterday as the head of the
World Bank warned the global economy was now 'in a danger zone'.

Up and down: The Dow Jones has fluctuated by 
more than 6,000 points since President Obama took office in January 
2009, hitting a low of 6,547 in the spring season of his first year and a high of 12,811 earlier in 2011

The volatility in the markets highlighted the inability of politicians and economists around the world to contain the crisis.

'Until politicians back their actions 
with words in respect to moving closer to a solution to the eurozone 
debt crisis, markets will continue to worry about a messy and painful 
outcome from the eurozone debt crisis'

Jane Foley, Rabobank

Finance ministers from the G20 countries meeting pledged yesterday to 'take all necessary actions to preserve the stability of the banking systems and financial markets'.

'The statement from the G20 last night may have taken the edge off the current bitter market sentiment but the reassurances from the finance ministers lack substance,' said Jane Foley of Rabobank.

'Until politicians back their actions 
with words in respect to moving closer to a solution to the eurozone 
debt crisis, markets will continue to worry about a messy and painful 
outcome from the eurozone debt crisis.'

Investors are also keeping a close watch on developments in Greece which could default.

'The markets are eagerly awaiting a 
resolution or at the minimum, a more rigid strategy to reduce Greece’s 
debt liabilities'

Giles Watts, City Index

'The markets are eagerly awaiting a resolution or at the minimum, a more rigid strategy to reduce Greece’s debt liabilities,' said Giles Watts, head of equities at City Index.

Athens has had meetings with its creditors this week to try to avoid that, but it's unclear whether it will be able to dig itself out of its debt hole, even with the help the European Union and the IMF.

As Wall Street suffered its worst day
of 2011 yesterday, World Bank President Robert Zoellick said a ‘steady 
drip of difficult economic news’ was eroding confidence in global 
markets.

The Dow Jones hit a year low at one point
on Thursday, as it fell 500 points in a second consecutive rout since 
the Federal Reserve said it was changing strategy for helping the 
economy.

Meanwhile, it was revealed more than 50 per cent of Americans say President Barack Obama is at fault for the dismal state of their economy - a majority for the first time since he took office in 2009.

President Obama inherited a high unemployment rate of 7.6 per cent when he started out in January 2009 - but it has risen to 9.1 per cent since then and is proving hard to push down.

The Fed, adopting a new strategy to try to get the U.S. economy going, announced on Wednesday it would shuffle $400billion of its own holdings in hopes of reducing interest rates on long-term loans.
