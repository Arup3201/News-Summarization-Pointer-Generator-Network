An 84-year-old man who blacked out while being bruised and bloodied by New York's Finest after jaywalking is hitting back with a lawsuit seeking millions.

Kang Wong says he has never broken a single law while living in the same Upper West Side apartment for almost 50 years, and he's suing for $5million after being 'humiliated' and roughed up and arrested for a minor infraction earlier this month.

The lawsuit first reported by the New York Daily News names the city, the police department and individual officers involved in a January 19 altercation with police who threw Mr Kang to the ground and arrested him for crossing the street.

Kang Wong, who lives near the Upper West Side, was stopped earlier this month by an officer for allegedly crossing the street against the light

'I didn’t commit any crime,' Mr Wong said during an interview with the paper translated by a family lawyer. 'It was excessive how they (the police) did it to me. If I did something wrong, I could understand, but I didn’t.

'They make me feel shame,' he added. 'I was very humiliated.'

Cops recently stepped up their presence at the corner of West 96th Street and Broadway after a series of traffic incidents involving pedestrians. Mr Kang told the Daily News he became an unwitting victim to their overzealous policing.

The former owner of La Nueva Victoria, a popular neighborhood restaurant, says he had a green light when he crossed the street but can't recall if it had changed by the time he made it across.

When he reached the other side he was met by a police officer asking for identification, he said. The retiree admitted that he does not speak much English, but that he did understand the request.

The cop took his ID and walked away, confusing the grandfather and causing him to ask for it back - in Cantonese.

According to one witness, several officers quickly converged on the man, who didn't seem to understand English-language commands, after he simply tried to walk away

'I was very puzzled and I was very scared,' said Mr Kang. 'I had no idea why I had been stopped. I used Cantonese and said give me back my ID.'

The officer responded by quickly pulling out his handcuffs and calling into his radio, according to Mr Kang and eyewitness accounts. Several more officers raced over and threw him against the side of a building.

'I got more scared,' he recalled.

Police then threw him to the ground and slapped cuffs on him.

Mr Kang says he blacked out during the rough treatment and woke up with his hands cuffed behind his back and blood streaming down his face, pictures taken at the scene confirm at least that much.

According to one witness, several officers quickly converged on the man, who didn’t seem to understand English-language commands, after he simply tried to walk away.

‘The guy didn’t seem to speak English,’ Ian King, a 24-year-old Fordham law student, told the New York Post.

‘He
 [the officer] stood him up against the wall and was trying to write him
 a ticket. The man didn’t seem to understand, and he started walking 
away.’

That’s when the officer and several colleagues quickly converged on the senior citizen and left him badly beaten and bloodied.

‘The cop tried to pull him back and that’s when he [the pedestrian] began to struggle with the cop,’ said Mr King.

‘As soon as he pushed the cop, it was like cops started running in from everywhere.’

Police Commissioner William Bratton initially praised the arrest, tweeting the commander did an 'excellent job' and saying at a news conference 'I’m not aware of excessive force in that at all.'

He has since deleted the tweet and the NYPD's Internal Affairs division is looking into the arrest. 

Law enforcement in the area had earlier promised to step-up enforcement of the law after three pedestrians were struck and killed 
within a two-block radius in the neighborhood in nine days, but Mr Kang's lawyer says increased vigilance shouldn't result in decreased dignity.

'We can have police efforts focused on pedestrian safety without violating the civil rights of our citizens,' attorney Sanford Rubenstein told the paper.

The former restauranteur says he immigrated from China to Cuba at age 19, and then later to New York where he eventually opened a restaurant after working his way up from washing dishes.

'I always respected the police,' he said. 'The officer and detectives from the precinct used to come into my restaurant all the time.'

He also claims he was denied food and water while being held in the precinct, and that 'the fingerprinting hurt.'

The latest crash occurred when a 26-year-old woman, Samantha Lee, was crossing 96th street when she was clipped by the driver’s side mirror of an ambulance.

She was run over by a red, four-door Dodge Charger after ending  up face-down in the road and was pronounced dead at the scene.

Both drivers stayed at the scene and no arrests were immediately made.

A week ago on Friday, a nine-year-old boy, Cooper Stock, was struck and killed by a taxi while crossing with his father, while the same night a tour bus dragged 73-year-old Alexander Shear to his death.

‘This intersection is getting worse and worse,’ one elderly neighbor told the Post.
