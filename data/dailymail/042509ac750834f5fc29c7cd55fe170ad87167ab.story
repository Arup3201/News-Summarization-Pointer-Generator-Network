Three tech giants have called on the U.S. government to provide greater transparency on national security requests as they sought to distance themselves from reports that portrayed the companies as willing partners in supplying mass user data to security agencies.

Google Inc was the first to go public, releasing an open letter asking the U.S. Department of Justice for permission to disclose the number and scope of data requests each receives from security agencies, including confidential requests made under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).

Microsoft Corp and Facebook Inc soon followed with similarly worded statements in support of Google.

The NSA program PRISM collects data on millions of internet users from the biggest companies in Silicon Valley

Google is pushing back against claims 
that it handed over user data en masse to a federal government program 
and saying that the NSA never had 'backdoor access' to its servers

Company executives are asking the 
Justice Department and the FBI to allow them to reveal the number of 
secret national security court requests for data to prove that what the 
search giant hands over is limited in scope.

The
 company was reported to have participated in PRISM, a program that 
mandated tech companies hand over millions of personal records to the 
federal government.

Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube and Apple all reportedly participate - all have denied any knowledge of or participation in the PRISM program.

Some of them have allegedly given direct access to their servers so the federal government can live-stream data.

On Sunday Larry Klayman, former 
Justice Department prosecutor, lodged a lawsuit  challenging the 
constitutionality of the NSA’s phone surveillance program and declaring 
the newly disclosed spy operation an 'outrageous breach of privacy.'

The suit names Klayman, the former 
chairman of Judicial Watch, and two others who say the government has 
illegally spied on their Verizon accounts.

Today Klayman told U.S. News he
 will file a second class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for 
the District of Columbia targeting government officials and each of the 
nine companies listed in a leaked National Security Agency slideshow as 
participants in the government's PRISM program.

Facebook and Google have denied any 
such access accusations - saying they cooperate with the federal 
government to the extent that they are required to - and not more.

'The U.S. government does not have 
direct access or a “back door” to the information stored in our data 
centers. We had not heard of a program called PRISM until yesterday,' 
the company said in a post last Friday.

Google's letter - which represented 
the first instance of the Mountain View, California-based company 
acknowledging that it has received FISA requests - argued that releasing
 the total number of national security requests would show the company 
does not give the government 'unfettered access' to its users' data.

'Assertions in the press that our 
compliance with these requests gives the U.S. government unfettered 
access to our users' data are simply untrue,' Google Chief Legal Officer
 David Drummond wrote in a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder and 
FBI Director Robert Mueller that was published on Google's public policy
 blog Tuesday.

'Google's numbers would clearly show 
that our compliance with these requests falls far short of the claims 
being made,' the letter said.

Google's letter came three days after
 Director of National Intelligence James Clapper confirmed Prism's 
existence and described it as an internal computer system that helped 
the government collect data obtained from Internet companies through 
FISA requests.

Since 2010, Google has published 
semiannual transparency reports that reveal the number of data requests 
it receives from authorities.

But the reports have never included requests made under FISA due to their confidential nature.

Following negotiations with the FBI, 
Google began publishing in March the number of national security letters
 - confidential requests for the data of domestic users - that it 
receives from law enforcement officials.

Drummond argued Tuesday that 
publishing the number of FISA requests would 'likewise serve the public 
interest without harming national security.'

Other Internet companies that are 
typically fierce rivals quickly closed ranks around Google. Sources 
close to the three companies said the statements were not coordinated.

'Permitting greater transparency on 
the aggregate volume and scope of national security requests, including 
FISA orders, would help the community understand and debate these 
important issues,' Microsoft said in an emailed statement.

Leading social network Facebook followed within minutes.

Following: Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's co-founder and chief executive. The social network said it would 'welcome the opportunity to provide a transparency report'

'We would welcome the opportunity to 
provide a transparency report that allows us to share with those who use
 Facebook around the world a complete picture of the government requests
 we receive, and how we respond,' Ted Ullyot, Facebook's general 
counsel, said in an emailed statement.

Twitter's top lawyer Alex Macgillivray also tweeted in support of Google.

'Completely agree with @Google, 
@SenJeffMerkley & others-we'd like more NSL transparency and 
@Twitter supports efforts to make that happen,' Macgillivray said.

FISA - the 1978 Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Act - created courts that oversee requests federal 
government for gathering information about suspected foreign agents. The
 requests and the rulings are secret and companies and individuals who 
receive court orders to hand over information are now allowed to 
publicly talk about the disclosures.

Federal
 authorities have said the PRISM program only monitors foreigners and is
 used to look for evidence of terrorist plots against the United States.

Despite denials by Google and Facebook executives, a New York Times
 report indicates that both companies worked to build 'digital safe 
rooms' that would allow the government to quickly and easily request and
 then retrieve data from the companies' servers.
