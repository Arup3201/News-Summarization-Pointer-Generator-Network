Case: Settlement negotiations are being held to divide up the $300 million estate of reclusive heiress Huguette Clark

Settlement negotiations are being held to divide up the $300 million estate of reclusive heiress Huguette Clark, with one month left until trial. 

A battle over her fortune is currently raging between her distant family and lawyer, doctor and former employees - the family are in line to 
receive millions if a deal is struck.

The heiress to a copper, timber and railroad fortune had no children and spent the last 20 years of her life living at Beth Israel Medical Center until she died in 2011 aged 104.

After she died Miss Clark's will was 
challenged by 19 of her relatives, who contend that she was mentally ill
and incompetent, the victim of fraud by her nurse, attorney and 
accountant.

Of the 19, 14 
admit they never met their reclusive aunt who shunned the trappings of 
wealth in favour of a quiet and understated lifestyle.

A
jury trial is scheduled to begin September 17 in Surrogate's Court in 
Manhattan - Clark’s relatives are opposing the beneficiaries of her will
including a charitable foundation, a hospital, Clark's nurse, a 
goddaughter, 
attorney, accountant, doctor and several employees.

In July papers filed in Manhattan Surrogate Court revealed disturbing allegations in the battle over Miss Clark's fortune.

According to the papers seen by the New York Post,
the heiress was mumbling incoherently and unable to hold the pen when 
she signed her $300million fortune away to her lawyer, doctor and 
employees.

Clark's relatives are opposing Bock's 
motion that the will was properly executed and she knew what she was 
doing when she signed it.

Earlier this month it was revealed a 
sensational new book is set to reveal the tragic, bizarre life of the 
reclusive heiress Huguette Clark.

Written
by a distant relative Paul Clark Newel Jr and Pulitzer Prize-winning 
investigative journalist Bill Dedman, the biography offers tantalizing 
details about the French-born multimillionaire who was fixated on 
life-like dolls and building miniature castles - often splashing out 
thousands of dollar to realize her visions.

Family of fortune: Ms Clark, right, as a child in 1917 with her wealthy father and her sister Andree

One example of typical excess from the early
life of Miss Clark came when her mother sold a painting her daughter 
took a deep dislike to in order to help a struggling musician.

'Madame
Cezanne in Red Dress' by Paul Cezanne terrified the young Huguette so 
much so that she rarely stepped foot out of her bedroom once her mother 
Anna E. Clark hung it in their 42-room, Fifth Avenue apartment, 
according to the New York Post.

According to the new biography, widowed Mrs Clark solved the problem in 1945 when acclaimed cellist Robert Maas came seeking her help.

Maas wanted to form a string quartet but could not afford instruments. He told the wealthy widow of four rare Stradivarius violins languishing in a Manhattan store which could only be purchased as a group.

Mrs Clark promptly snatched the Cezanne masterpiece from the wall and had her driver take her to an art gallery where she sold the painting and then paid $200,000 ($2.6million today) for the violins.

The generous donation led to the formation of the Paganini Quartet, a renowned classical violinists which became famous the world over.

Behind closed doors: Few people entered the 42-room home of the reclusive heiress which was filled with rare dolls

Such lavish spending became commonplace in the life of Huguette Clark, turning her adult-life into a strange place filled with childhood obsessions.

She spent millions of dollars building up a collection of rare French and Japanese dolls.

According to the Post, one of the few people who visited Clark at her apartments in the 1950s said that a long gallery was lined with dolls, each seated on its own sumptuous armchair.

One of Ms Clark's few outings was to attend Christian Dior fashion shows in order to find clothes to dress her dolls.

The heiress was also obsessed with building miniature models.

A lover of Japanese culture, although she never traveled, Clark paid for someone to travel to Japan to photograph and note the specifications of the castles she wanted to build from the confines of her mansion.

While she stayed at the hospital, her
three fabulous homes sat empty: the $100million Bellosguardo estate, a 
$24million country house in Connecticut and a $100million co-op, the 
largest apartment on Fifth Avenue overlooking Central Park.

She
inherited her wealth from her father, Montana Senator William Clark, 
and his copper mines but regarded her great wealth as 'a menace to 
happiness'.

When she died two weeks shy of her 105th birthday the only people present at her burial were funeral home employees.
