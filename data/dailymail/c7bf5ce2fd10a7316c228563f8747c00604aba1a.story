Sitting in the studio audience, Gordon Ramsay’s daughter watched her father’s latest television interview with pride.

Until, that is, the topic of conversation shifted to her.

The famously forthright chef revealed that he has been checking  up on whether the 15-year-old is doing her exam revision – with the help of a spy camera he has installed in her bedroom.

A close eye: Though Megan seemed delighted by her shopping spree here, the new revelations are likely to prove less welcome

Ramsay disclosed in an interview with Jonathan Ross how he enlisted the help of his 13-year-old son Jack to keep tabs on daughter Megan.

He said: ‘Megan’s 15, she’s here tonight with her boyfriend.

‘They’ve been spending a lot  of time in her room recently.  But revising.

‘Revising … They seem to be spending a lot of time revising  and yet the results aren’t … 

Spy-cam: Ramsay said he paid his son Jack to secretly install a Go-Pro camera in Megan's wardrobe

‘I’ve been a bit naughty over the last couple of weeks because I got Jack a little Go-Pro. One of those little secret cameras.

‘So I said to him, “Look mate, here’s twenty quid, go and target your big sister’s room and put that camera right at the top left-hand side of the wardrobe”.

‘So, Megan, I’d like to talk to you about your revising …’

Go-Pro is a brand of high-definition personal cameras.

The Scottish chef’s move is a controversial one – and not only in Megan’s eyes. Last year, US college student Aubrey Ireland was granted a civil stalking order against her parents due to their overprotective behaviour that included installing monitoring software on her electronics.

Ramsay, 46, and his wife Tana, 38, have four children from their 16-year marriage. Jack has a twin sister, Holly, and Matilda, 11, is the youngest in the family.

The chef is known as a fitness fanatic and recently took part in an Ironman competition, which involves a 1.2-mile swim, a 56-mile bike ride and a half-marathon.

Ripped: The chef prides himself on his success, and joked that he would give Jamie Oliver a Michelin star if he could follow in his fitness footsteps

It led Ramsay to issue a challenge to fellow chef Jamie Oliver on the Jonathan Ross Show, which will be shown on ITV tomorrow.

He told Ross: ‘If he completes an Iron Man, I’ll give him a Michelin star.’

Ramsay has been awarded 15 Michelin stars in total, and currently holds 12.
