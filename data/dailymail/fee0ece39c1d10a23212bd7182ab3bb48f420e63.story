A maths teacher has immortalized some of history's most famous people and places using thousands of LEGO pieces.

Arthur Gugick, 54, from Cleveland, has built hundreds of scale miniatures of global landmarks and detailed portraits of pop-culture icons using nothing but the little colored bricks.

His work spans a wide variety of subjects, from portraits of John Lennon and Jimi Hendrix to model replicas of Big Ben and the White House. 

He has even recreated historical works of art by Van Gogh and Leonardo da Vinci.

Mr Gugick has a distinct advantage over other LEGO artists thanks to his day job as a maths teacher at Beachwood High School, Cleveland, Ohio.

He said: 'I use a lot of mathematics when building the architectural landmarks. For the Roman Coliseum I needed calculus.

'For the Taj Mahal I actually had to write my own computer software to help me make the dome.'

Depending on the size of the project each model contains 5,000 to 20,000 pieces. Mr Gugick owns more than a million pieces in total, all sorted by size and color.

To cut down costs Mr Gugick, who has been playing with Lego since he was seven years old, buys the majority of his bricks online, spending roughly £30 for 1,000 pieces.

He has never used a drop of glue to hold a piece together and carefully avoids using shop-bought models.

On average it takes Mr Gugick two to three months to complete a project, and for a while he struggled to balance his hobby with his career and spending time with his two sons, Benjamin, 17, and Jason, 14.

Mr Gugick said: 'When they were younger they were never allowed to help me. Something had to give in terms of sharing time with them and my hobby.

'In the end I decided to stop watching television. I've missed sporting events and I don't know who won the last series of the X Factor. The time I spent watching television now belongs to my Lego building and my family.'

Mr Gugick is part of a growing community known as the AFOLs, which stands for Adult Fans Of Lego.

He began building more complex models and mosaics about 15 years ago and has since noticed a surge in the products popularity with adults.

Mr Gugick said: 'In the last 10 years the number of adults who claim to enjoy Lego has increased tenfold.

'There are Lego conventions. When I started there were only two conventions in the United States, now there's probably 200 to 300 conventions worldwide. It's almost too many.

'There's even a Lego group in Britain called the Brickish.'

Mr Gugick also acknowledged the impact of the 2014 film, 'The Lego Movie', which topped box offices worldwide.

He said: 'The Lego movie has absolutely helped adults to rediscover Lego because most of the audience were parents being dragged to it by their kids.'
