After being chauffeured to the University of Georgia in his luxury SUV and entering the football stadium to screams from the crowd, this star is given the best seat in the house.

This isn't one of the players but someone far more important: Uga the dog.

The English bulldog has been UGA's official mascot since September 2012 and with his notoriety comes a life of unimaginable luxury.

Uga wears personalized Nike jerseys, travels in his own SUV with his own license plate and enjoys air-conditioned kennels - as well as plenty of attention from cheerleaders, players and fans.

But he's not the first - he's from a long line of English bulldog mascots.

One of his ancestors first became the school's mascot when former student Sonny Seiler, who was then at Georgia's law school, put a homemade jersey on his puppy and took him to a game in 1956.

After the pooch appeared in the stands, the team asked him to be their official mascot.

'And so we named him Uga' after UGA, Seiler told CBS Sunday Morning.

Following Uga's death, the Seiler family got a second dog - Uga II - and have been sharing their pets with the university football team and fans ever since.

They do not get paid for lending their dogs to the team, although the pets do enjoy the perks of sponsorships.

Today's Uga - Uga IX - lives with Seiler's son, Charles, who grew up with the dogs.

All his: Uga has his own SUV at his owner's home in Savannah - in red to match the team's colors

Spoiled: The SUV has a personalized license plate for the dog, who is the ninth Uga to support the team

At home: He has his own bedroom, which is decorated with photos of his mascot ancestors

Wardrobe: He has a selection of personalized UGA jerseys that have been made by Nike

'A lot of people say Uga's my brother,' he said.

At his home in Savannah, Georgia, the dog has his own room with access to a yard through a doggy door. There are photos of his ancestors across the walls and football showing on a flat-screen TV.

In his bedroom, he has an extensive collection of Nike jerseys made from the same material as the players' uniforms.

Outside, he has his own red SUV with a personalized license plate, reading UGA IX.

The vehicle is air conditioned so that he can travel the four hours to Athens, Georgia for home games in comfort.

After arriving in Athens, he meets his fans before heading to the Uga suite, where he has a bath using baby shampoo before every game.

He then rides onto the field in a golf cart before settling down in his air-conditioned doghouse next to a bag of ice - where his view of the game is only interrupted by a cheerleader popping by to pet him.

If his team wins, grinning players and fans line up to thank him - but if they lose, he's never the one who gets the blame, CBS reported.

Although he is known as Uga IX to fans, he also goes by the name of Russ.

He was first seen on the field in 2009 when he stepped in for his brother Uga VII, who became sick. Uga VIII then took over and passed away in 2011. Uga IX was ultimately named the official mascot in September 2012.

'Russ has endeared himself to the Georgia people over the last three years,' UGA Director of Athletics Greg McGarity said on the team's website. 'His dedication to duty when called upon has been exemplary and it's fitting that he takes his place in the official line of Georgia mascots.'

When CBS asked the Seilers if they could appreciate that some people might find the dog's lifestyle silly, they were blank-faced.

'I don't understand your question,' the older Seiler said.
