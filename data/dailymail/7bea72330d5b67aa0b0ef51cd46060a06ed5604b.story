'I know that with 4-4-2 the stats are giving the positive results, but when you analyse the game I have twitched my ass on the bench because we were out of balance.' 

The expert analysis of Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal captured the imagination this week when he admitted playing his 4-4-2 formation resulted in a very unhappy derrière.

But does that deserve a place in the Hall of Fame for bizarre managers' quotes? Let's compare.

Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal complained about 4-4-2 leaving him 'twitching my ass'

Jose Mourinho

Seeing as we all knew he'd make an appearance, we may as well get the Special One out of the way immediately. But how do you choose from one of his many press conference quips?

Well, firing a parting shot at owner Roman Abramovich for not investing in the squad before being forced out of the club in 2007, Mourinho said: 'No eggs, no omelette. And it depends on the quality of the eggs.

'In the supermarket, you have eggs class one, class two, class three. Some are more expensive than others and some give you better omelettes. So when the class one eggs are in Waitrose and you cannot go there, you have a problem.' 

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho is never far from a memorable quip during press conferences

Rafa Benitez

Perhaps best remembered for his infamous 'FACT!' rant against then-Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, but Benitez was another who had a thing for breakfast ingredients.

The former Liverpool manager answered Roy Hodgson's remarks on Kenny Dalglish's involvement in the club by saying: 'White liquid in a bottle has to be milk,' - apparently, a Spanish phrase which means things are so obvious for everyone to see (except perhaps the meaning of the saying itself).

Benitez then followed this up when accused of having a poor transfer record and inheriting a poor squad by exclaiming: 'Some people can not see a priest on a mountain of sugar,' - which again means something akin to stating the obvious... without actually doing so.

Rafa Benitez (right) made some memorable speeches during his time as Liverpool manager

Sir Alex Ferguson

And so to Fergie. He wasn't against using food to make a point, either.

Before a Champions League game against a notoriously tricky Inter Milan side, the ex-Manchester United manager indulged in an opening course of mind games: 'When an Italian tells me it's pasta on the plate, I check under the sauce to make sure. They are the inventors of the smokescreen.' 

Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson was not immune to making an infamous quote

Bill Shankly 

Shankly was Liverpool's greatest ever manager, and will also be remembered by Anfield fans for his cutting put downs of hated rivals Everton, which included this collection of pearls:

Brian Clough

Clough was never short of sharing a few words. The former Nottingham Forest manager wasn't even scared to engage Fergie in a war of words.

Clough, before the then-United manager had claimed a second European Cup, said: 'For all his horses, knighthoods and championships, he hasn't got two of what I've got. And I don't mean balls!'

And the testicular references didn't end there as, when discussing the influx of foreign players into the English game, he said: 'I can't even spell spaghetti never mind talk Italian. How could I tell an Italian to get the ball? He might grab mine.'

Brian Clough was never short of sharing a few words as the ex-Nottingham Forest manager proved

Ian Holloway

Never short of a decent quote. Holloway, in between being 'more chuffed than a badger at the start of mating season', had this to say about an 'ugly' result against Chesterfield.

Please note, it should be read with that typical deadpan Bristolian accent for full effect. 

'To put it in gentleman's terms if you've been out for a night and you're looking for a young lady and you pull one, some weeks they're good looking and some weeks they're not the best,' he said.

'Our performance today would have been not the best looking bird but at least we got her in the taxi. She weren't the best looking lady we ended up taking home but she was very pleasant and very nice, so thanks very much, let's have a coffee.'

Ian Holloway has become renowned for memorable quotes during his managerial career in England 

Sir Bobby Robson

The late, great Sir Bobby was rarely short of a quirky comment. So, try these on for size:

Gordon Strachan

Strachan was another manager who must have missed the media training classes, much to the delight and amusement of anyone listening...

Here are just a few examples that left reporters wishing they had chosen a different profession.

Reporter: 'Bang, there goes your unbeaten run. Can you take it?'

Strachan: 'No, I'm just going to crumble like a wreck. I'll go home, become an alcoholic and maybe jump off a bridge. Umm, I think I can take it, yeah.'

Reporter: 'So, Gordon, in what areas do you think Middlesbrough were better than you today?'

Strachan: 'What areas? Mainly that big green one out there...'

And, probably the finest one word answer in the history of football interviews.

Reporter: 'Gordon, can we have a quick word please?'

Strachan: 'Velocity.' [walks off]

Gordon Strachan is among the best for leaving journalists stunned during interviews after and before matches

Arsene Wenger

Wenger usually gives well rehearsed and educated answers to questions from the press, even if it sometimes appears as he is struggling to keep a straight face.

But the Frenchman has occasionally drawn into using strange metaphors, especially when baited by enduring rivals. In response to Ferguson's jibe that Arsenal weren't deserving double winners in 2002 and United were the better team, Wenger simply answered: 'Everyone thinks they have the prettiest wife at home.'

And, he also reverted to the female form when describing his inability to convince a homesick Antonio Reyes to stay at Highbury.

'It's like you wanting to marry Miss World and she doesn't want you, what can I do about it? I can try to help you, but if she does not want to marry you what can I do?,' he said. The answer being to let Reyes leave and sneak Cesc Fabregas from Barcelona's youth academy.

And finally...

It not just  football managers that are renowned for memorable quips during press conferences. Sometimes, it comes down to the players. Step forward, King Eric himself.

Greeting the journalists before him in the wake of a lengthy ban for his kung-fu kick on a Crystal Palace supporter in 1995, Cantona read out the following statement before abruptly leaving.

'When the seagulls follow the trawler, it's because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea. Thank you very much.'

Quite what you make of the Cantona's musings should be determined by you but as Strachan - yes, him again - later said: 'If a Frenchman goes on about seagulls, trawlers and sardines, he's called a philosopher. I'd just be called a short Scottish bum talking crap'.
