With gargoyles, suits of armours and ornate chandeliers, this exquisite home is the quintessential 400-year-old Medieval castle, taking you back in time to a world of Kings, Queens and knights in shining armour.

However, the incredible property ‘Castambul Castle’ was only completed in 2008 and is nestled in a valley in rural Australia.

‘It’s like living in a fairy tale – a modern day fairy tale,’ said Toop & Toop real estate agent Troy Tindall.

'It’s just 35 minutes from Adelaide’s CBD but it feels like 400 years back in the past.’

The breathtaking castle was just a vacant block at the top of a South Australian valley when construction began in 2000. The Gorge Road property in Paracombe, a small town north east of Adelaide, is now hitting the market for the first time.

Immediately upon arrival, visitors are whisked away to another world, with a greeting from a 'knight in shining armour', a stone archway, ornate staircase complete with the castle's crest printed in gold on the rich red carpets

The castle is made from South Australian stone and boasts seven bedrooms, turrets, gargoyles and a lift - despite only have two floors

The bedrooms are one-of-a-kind designs, with hand painted ceilings and no expenses spared for the decadent, ornate furnishings with gold details

The property took around eight years to complete due to the meticulous attention to detail – including 18 months hand painting every ceiling.

The ceilings are also lined with gold trim and decorated with intricate diamond and ruby chandeliers. One of the two remaining ceiling artists were called in to create the breathtaking art - worthy of royalty.

‘There are the most incredible images on the ceilings. In one room, there are images of this castle and the valley surrounding it. On another, there are cherub angels.

‘In the billiard games room the ceiling has been painted to look like timber. It’s incredible.’

‘This is an incredible opportunity. 60 acres and your own private castle. It is like nothing I have ever seen before.’

With no expense spared, the castle is the perfect meeting of modern and medieval. The home is the height of sophistication with the ‘Castumbul Castle’ crest imprinted on the marble floors and on the carpet throughout the home. There are also chandeliers, gold features, candelabras, Renaissance paintings and taxidermy throughout the stunning residence. 

It is also a wine connoisseur’s dream due to its spacious cellar, equipped with a wine tasting room. It is of course in one of South Australia's finest wine regions.

There is also a library with stunning timber in-built book shelves and beautiful French windows with box seats to read as you look over the valley.

Much of the furniture will remain in the home, as 'the home was designed around the pieces of furniture' including a flatscreen television screen which has been built into an antique-style, hand-carved timber feature.  

The living room upstairs boasts gold and diamond chandeliers, a hand crafted wooden staircase, breathtaking ceilings and a modern touch, with a home cinema, decorated with theatrical red velvet curtains

The kitchen is an exquisite sight, with marble bench tops, gold taps and even a ruby and crystal chandelier. It is one of two kitchens, as there is also a commercial kitchen in the building

It is hard to believe that the bedrooms were only recently constructed and decorated, as no time or expense has been spared to recreated a luxurious palace bedroom - fit for a queen, including incredible Renaissance artwork, gas lamps and gold wallpaper

There are medieval swords in the dining room and gargoyles on the balcony, ensuring this home is like nothing you have ever experienced before.

However, this home is also the height of technical sophistication with a home cinema, equipped with luxurious, plush seating, offset by the quintessential, theatrical velvet red curtains.

Also, in the master bedrooms ensuite, a simple touch of a button and a television screen appears at the foot at the tub, rising from within a marble casing.

The bedrooms are one-of-a-kind, unique designs with four-post beds, intricate wallpaper and bejewelled chandeleirs.

But the most incredible feature are the curtains, made from fabric from the estate of Princess Diana.

‘The curtains are such an incredible feature. They are made from material belonging to Princess Diana and the owner spent several years negotiating with the estate. They are very beautiful.’

The perfect setting for a medieval feast or an Aussie BBQ! The stone and marble dining room is a perfect replica of a Medieval banquet scene, and wouldn't look out of place in a Game of Thrones scene... 

The black and pink bathroom has a television hidden in the marble, which pops up at your feet with the touch of a button

The cinema is luxurious, complete with a bar, plush seats and even smaller leather seats for tiny tots. The perfect place for a movie marathon!

The palace looks over a South Australian valley and down to a swimming dam, which is equipped with a sun deck and diving board

The home is stunning at first sight, with the incredible entrance hall immediately transporting you into a different world. You are welcomed by a suit of armour, mounted candelabras, stone archways, deep red carpets, marble floors and an impressive cedar staircase.

It has ‘unlimited’ opportunities, with a commercial kitchen and dumbwaiter, as well as the wine tasting room and separate guest wing making it the perfect location for a Bed and Breakfast, weddings or a wine tasting venue.

‘There is a levelled area near the home which is ready for a tennis court or a ballroom. This property would be perfect for a home, a business or a home-business,’ explains Mr Tindall.

There is another kitchen in the home, which is made with marble, gold detailing and a timber island bench, with inset sink with gold taps. 

It is hard to believe the home is just 35 minutes from Adelaide's CBD, with the incredible Gargoyle features on the home's balcony

The 'CC' crest for the Castambul Castle is featured on the marble floors and on the carpets throughout the home

Each room in this castle has been well-researched and is a perfect replica of historical European castles – with a touch of the fantastical.

Throughout the two-storey, five-bedroom home are mosaic windows, depicting medieval scenes of knights in shining armour and fairy tale castles.

It is whimsical, beautiful and a unique, luxurious lifestyle.

Despite being only two levels, there’s an elevator between floors.

There is also incredible diversity in the home, with the contrast of the black formal living room and black bathrooms to the stunning, white atrium with French windows, teeming with sunshine and light.

There is a swimming dam, equipped with a sun deck and a diving ramp. With no other houses in sight, it is the perfect way to escape the hustle and bustle of 21st Century life and enter a fantasy world of decadence, glamour and unbridled sophistication. 

Although it should be noted that this incredible home may not be suitable for small children or people seeking a low-maintenance, low-key lifestyle. 

The stunning atrium has large french windows to let in light for a beautiful meal in the South Australian sunshine
