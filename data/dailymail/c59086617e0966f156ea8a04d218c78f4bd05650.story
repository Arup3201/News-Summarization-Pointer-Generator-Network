A teenager who was allegedly starved and mistreated by his parents for four years has put on 10 pounds in just a week following his rescue.

Mitch Comer, from Georgia, was found wandering around a Los Angeles bus station looking emaciated and much younger than his 18 years.

The pale and gaunt boy told police that his stepfather Paul had given him $200 and put him on a bus to California on September 8, a day after his 18th birthday, telling him he was now a man.

In jail: Paul and Sheila Marie Comer are awaiting bond hearings after allegedly starving and maltreating 18-year-old Mitch, who was found wandering around a bus station more than 2,000 miles from home

Mr Comer and the boy's mother Sheila Marie were arrested on six charges of child abuse and one charge of false imprisonment on September 12, at their home near Dallas.

They are being held in Paulding 
County jail and have bond hearings scheduled for 9am on Thursday at the 
Paulding County courthouse, according to the Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution.

Mitch meanwhile, who weighed just 87 pounds and whose skin was practically translucent when he was found, is said to be 'doing well'.

As an 18-year-old, he was not eligible for foster care, but has been taken in by a local family, detectives said.

He did not know his own address, but his parents 
were quickly tracked down.

The couple’s two daughters have been in protective custody since their parents were arrested, investigators said.

'Abuse': Mitch told detectives he was forced to stand against the wall at the family home near Dallas, Georgia, for up to eight hours at a time

The Comers have no prior criminal 
history, but were the subject of a 2009 investigation by local 
authorities following an abuse allegation when the family lived in 
Cherokee County.

The case was referred to the Cherokee Sheriff’s Office, but was later closed, and no charges were filed.

Retired Los Angeles police Sgt. Joe Gonzalez spotted Mitch at a downtown bus station on September 11, and could not believe the stunted and gaunt teenager was more than 12 or 13 years old.

The teenager told detectives that his stepfather had driven him to a bus station in Jackson, Mississippi on his 18th birthday and given him the cash, along with a list of homeless shelters.

Mitch told the police that he had suffered years of abuse after being taken out of school in the eighth grade.

He said he was locked in a bedroom and fed tiny quantities of food. He was forced to stand on his toes against a wall with his fingers interlaced behind his head for eight hours every day.

The boy was kept in such seclusion that his two younger sisters in the same house did not know what he looked like, the authorities revealed.

'The sisters haven't seen the brother in over two years,' said Paulding's Cpl. Ashley Henson. 'They didn't even know what colour his hair was.'

Neighbours on the quiet cul-de-sac of two-storey brick and vinyl siding homes, about 30 miles outside Atlanta, said the couple kept to themselves and were shocked to discover that the family had a son.

The FBI and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation have joined the case, Cpl. Henson added.

Mrs Comer’s mother, Diana Powell, of Iowa, said she hadn’t spoken to her daughter in more than a decade and hadn’t seen her grandson since he was a toddler.

Powell told the station that she had feared her daughter and husband abused their children but had no direct evidence.

'They mistreated him something terrible. I got on her case about it and she disappeared from my life,’ she said crying.

Authorities say that they are just at
 the ‘tip of the iceberg’ with the case and more charges could be 
brought against the parents.

Monica Moore, an investigator with the Paulding County District Attorney’s office, described the 18-year-old victim as small, very timid, and extremely polite.

Moore confirmed that a local family had agreed to house the teenager, according to Channel 2.

A spokesman from Paulding County Public Schools could also not confirm whether the children have ever been enrolled in the school system.

State and local officials prepare to search Paul and Shelia Comer's Dallas home

Records show the Comers have lived in almost two dozen different homes during the past two decades. Neighbours said the family had lived at their large Dallas home for at least a few years.

Neighbours Dion Walker and Mea Smith told AJC that their children had played with the Comers’ daughters over the years but that they had never even seen Mitch.

They said they were surprised to learn the family had a son. 'Maybe, when the young girls would stare at us, were they trying to say something?' said Mr Walker. 'Should we have noticed?'

Mitch was flown back to Dallas on Wednesday to participate in the investigation and legal proceedings.

His stepfather had his own business repairing home appliances, said next-door neighbour John White. They rarely spoke.

Mrs Comer never left the house unless she was with her husband, 
not even to check the mail, said Mr White. Their two daughters would 
sometimes come outside and play, but only in the back yard.

Neighbours 
assumed the girls didn't go to school either – they never caught the bus
 that picked up other children in the cul-de-sac every morning.

Neighbors said they had no clue the Comers had a son until a detective came knocking at their doors asking questions last week.

'I had no idea, no clue. There were no signs of a son at all,' said Mr Walker, who has lived next to the Comers for two years. 'The few 
occasions we would see them go to the van, it was always the parents and
 the two girls.'

Walker said police swarmed the Comers' home last week, arresting the parents and taking both girls into protective custody.

Walker said the Comer family did not take part in neighbourhood 
association meetings and their girls never attended the neighbourhood 
Halloween block parties.
