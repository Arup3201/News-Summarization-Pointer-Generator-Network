Ryan Shawcross normally scores once a year. On New Year's Day the Stoke City defender broke protocol and got his second goal this season against former club Manchester United.

It took the 27-year-old just two minutes into the Barclays Premier League of 2015 to remind us why it's the best there is (and why Bundesliga and La Liga can keep their winter breaks).

January 1 had just about everything; goals, penalties, red cards, talking points, a twist or two, a Jose Mourinho rant, and more than a few questionable refereeing decisions.

Was it the greatest day the Premier League has seen since it was founded in 1992? That's down to personal preference, but here are the statistics that may persuade you otherwise.

It is just the second time in English footballing history that two sides have been joint-top alphabetically after December

Just twice has this happened come the turn of the year. Chelsea and Manchester City have identical records - sharing 46 points, 44 goals for, 19 against, plus-25 difference.

But Mourinho has only himself to blame for not being seven points clear in 2015.

The Chelsea manager, in between insisting Premier League referees are conspiring against him, has been punished by former confidant Frank Lampard at the Etihad.

Frank Lampard's goals against Sunderland, Leicester City and Chelsea have been vital in the title chase

Manuel Pellegrini is using Mourinho's own weapon against him after the 36-year-old was allowed to leave Stamford Bridge in June,  ending up in Manchester via New York.

The former England midfielder's goals against Sunderland, Leicester City and Chelsea mean he has earned Pellegrini five points, and denied Mourinho two in the process.

But there's good news for Chelsea. When Arsenal were tied with Manchester United on points, goals for, goals against and difference on January 10, 2004, Arsene Wenger went on to win the title.

If Chelsea and Manchester City's records remain identical come May, then both sides would need a one-off winner-takes-all match to determine the champions. Fingers crossed, neutrals.

There were 33 goals scored, the most  on New Year's Day since 1987

Largely down to the evening's London derby between Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea, where  neutrals (and BT Sport) were relieved it was on television.

And the five goals between Manchester City and Sunderland in their 3-2 thriller helped, too, all coming in just 16 minutes and 12 seconds.

The early game, sadly, did not become a free-for-all, not even with Manchester United's £154million attack, but others made up for it.

The 10 fixtures had 33 between them, the most since 1987 when 11 matches saw 34, including a 3-1 win for Oxford United over Southampton and a 3-1 defeat for Wimbledon by Arsenal.

New Year's Day almost doubled the amount of goals on December 28, too, where just 17 goals were scored and three 0-0 scorelines played out. Not the worst of welcomes to the new year.

The eight goals at White Hart Lane made for an entertaining evening match on an action-packed January 1

 Mourinhio's men conceded five and scored three at White Hart Lane as Chelsea lost 5-3 against Tottenham

12 - Manchester City

11 - Southampton, Burnley

8 - QPR, Leicester, Crystal Palace, Chelsea

7 - Tottenham, Liverpool, West Ham

6 - Everton, Manchester United, Swansea

5 - Stoke, West Brom, Sunderland, Hull

4 - Arsenal, Newcastle

3 - Aston Villa 

The woodwork was struck 16 times - the most ever recorded on a Premier League day since 2006/07 

So, there could have been even more scored. 

Among those was Peter Crouch who could have nicked a win for Stoke City in the second half. You can try and mark the 6ft 7in striker, though it often does little good. He rose highest, but could not been the right post.

At St James' Park, too, there could have been more than the six goals scored between Newcastle United and Burnley.

The latter were desperately unlucky, hitting the woodwork  twice in one move through Danny Ings and Ashley Barnes during the 3-3 draw.

It remains Manchester City who have hit the woodwork more times than any other club (12) this season, with Southampton and Burnley (both 11) catching up.

Jose Mourinho conceded five for just the second time in his career

This doesn't happen. Mourinho doesn't allow teams he manages to concede five. To him, three is an disappointment. Four, an embarrassment. 

But five? 

That's what happened at White Hart Lane, largely down to their in-house striker. 

Harry Kane, shaking loose Oscar, scored from where he had no right to. It brought Tottenham level, and they went on to win 5-3.

The only other time Mourinho  felt this was on November 29, 2010. He, then of Real Madrid, lost 5-0 against Barcelona at the Nou Camp.

'I hope this game does not affect us psychologically,' Mourinho said in the aftermath.

'I have spoken to the players and told them the title is not gone. We can't leave here crying.'

Barcelona went on to win the title, never losing top spot following the 5-0 drubbing, and Real finished four points adrift.

Chelsea conceded five for just the third time in the Premier League era

Speaking of five, it was just the third time Chelsea conceded so many in a Premier League game.

The others? Liverpool beat them 5-1 on September 21, 1996, at Anfield, and Arsenal beat them 5-3 on October 29, 2011, at Stamford Bridge with a Robin van Persie hat-trick.

Liverpool 2-2 Newcastle, Sep 2, 2002

Liverpool 2-2 Birmingham, Sep 11, 2002 

Liverpool surrendered a two-goal lead at Anfield for just the third time in the Premier League era

Anfield. The Kop. The You Never Walk Alone anthem. It's all designed to scare the living daylights out of visitors to the red half of Merseyside.

That is partly why they have only let a two-goal lead slip at their iconic home twice before. Sadly for Brendan Rodgers, Leicester City were fearless on New Year's Day, even after going 2-0 down.

Nigel Pearson's men fought back after two dubious penalties, both scored by the soon-to-be departing Steven Gerrard, claiming a 2-2 draw against last season's Premier League runners up.

When else did Liverpool surrender a two-goal lead? Against Newcastle, when Gary Speed and Alan Shearer scored late goals, and Birmingham City after a Clinton Morison brace.

Those two, strangely, came within a little more than a week of each other - Newcastle on September 2, 2002, and Birmingham on September 11.

Four referees that may have explained themselves if they were allowed to do so:

And one more thing...

Officials were at their downright worst. 

The state of the decisions on New Year's Day suggested one or two of the referees had a little too much sherry the night before.

But schadenfreude can be a funny thing. Some of them, so ridiculous, that they were laughable.

Take, for example, poor old Wes Morgan. 

The Leicester City defender takes one to the face from Raheem Sterling, then hears Mike Jones blow his whistle for  a penalty. 

Referees aren't held accountable for their mistakes in the modern game, and this is where common sense should prevail.

It is calling for officials to be allowed to speak after games, whether to apologise for a decision or explain it. They're only human after all.
