As a family day out, it must rank as one of the more bizarre and macabre.

Men, women and children lined up in the sunshine yesterday for a chance to view the corpse of Muammar Gaddafi.

The dictator’s body – on show in a 
refrigerated storeroom at a shopping centre – was the sole attraction in
 Misrata, once Libya’s richest city, now reduced to rubble after the 
war.

Undignified end: Gaddafi's head is turned slightly to the left. There are suggestions that this has been done to hide a bullet hole in his skull

The cadaver – along with those of 
Gaddafi’s son Mutassim and ex-defence minister Abu Bakr Younis – was 
taken to the storeroom after the dictator was killed on Thursday.

But discoloured and fast decaying, it is presenting Libya’s new rulers with one of their first conundrums: what to do with it.

With residents of the country’s major
 cities refusing to have the dictator buried in their midst, and calls 
by Gaddafi’s wife for the body to be sent to her in exile in Algeria, 
Libya’s military chiefs are even discussing disposing of it in the 
Mediterranean.

  

‘We don’t want a shrine to him,’ one commander said yesterday.

‘He doesn’t deserve a proper burial. We need to get rid of the body the way the Americans dealt with Osama Bin Laden.’

Before the first families were 
allowed into the shopping centre yesterday, a post-mortem was carried 
out.

The ghoulish scene didn't stop queues stretching around the block as people flocked to gawp at the toppled tyrant.

In a dank, cold room in the makeshift mortuary, the former leader's body was covered by a blue blanket that left only his head exposed, hiding the bruises on his torso and scratch marks on his chest.             

Gaddafi's battered head had been turned to the left, to hide the bullet hole that killed him. Guards overseeing the body had handed out green surgical masks because of the awful smell.

Libya's chief forensic pathologist Dr Othman al-Zintani today said an autopsy had confirmed Gaddafi was killed by a shot to the head, and he also had bullet wounds to the abdomen.

Doctors completed the examination today but Dr al-Zintani would not give more details until he has given his report to the attorney general.

Authorities in Libya want to establish whether he died in crossfire on the way to 
hospital, as the government has suggested, or whether he was executed by the 
fighters who caught him.

Rebel fighters claim they captured the 69-year-old alive and then shot him. But this account differs from the National Transitional Council's version, in which Gaddafi died in a gun-fight.

One rebel today claimed that Gaddafi 
pleaded for his life, offering them as much gold as they wanted in 
return for sparing his life.

Hammad Mufti Ali, 28, told Italian 
daily Corriere Della Sera that a terrified Gaddafi swore he would  pay 
for their children to go to school.

Mr Ali added: 'At one point someone 
screamed at him that instead of talking about money, as a good Muslim he
 should have been praying for his soul to be entrusted to God before 
dying.

'But he just kept saying he was ready to give us lots and lots of money and gold.'

He said that Gaddafi was then dragged on to the truck in scenes seen around the world and 'that's where he died.

'His body just could not take it. He was losing too much blood.'

Gaddafi was said to have more that 
$200billion in cash and gold hidden away with some of it spread in 
secret accounts across the world, including in Zimbabwe.

A row has now broken out over what 
will happen to the tyrant's body next, with his surviving family members
 demanding it is released so he can be afforded a traditional funeral 
with 24 hours. His  widow Safia has also backed international demands for an inquiry into his killing.

Reports last night suggested the National 
Transitional Council will hand over the dead dictator's corpse to 
members of his extended family.

Acting prime minister Mahmoud Jibril said today that investigations into who shot Gaddafi were continuing.

Final hiding place: The inside of a concrete tunnel into which Gaddafi and a small number of body guards crawled into once their convoy had been hit

No escape now: Gaddafi is surrounded by rebels waving AK-47s and walked 
across the barren desert. His left arm has been wounded, possibly when 
his convoy of 80 jeeps was hit by air raids

Last gasps of breath: A handgun is pointed at Gaddafi as he lays bleeding on the floor of an ambulance. The next time he was seen in public he was dead

He gave his own account of the likely events leading up to the death of the former Libyan leader. He
 said: 'It seems that he was involved in a battle between the Qatari 
security brigades of Gaddafi and the freedom fighters. And he was hiding
 in some sort of a sewage tube.

'One of the mercenaries, he's a 
Mauritanian, when he was caught he told the freedom fighters that 
Gaddafi was hiding in the tube,' said Mr Jibril.

'So they went there and they brought him out and they were taking him to that truck to take him to a field hospital.

'On
 their way they got in crossfire between the freedom fighters and the 
security brigades. He was shot in the head. We don't know whether he was
 shot by the freedom fighters or the security brigades.'

A local military commander in the city of Misrata, where the force which captured him took his body, said 'over-enthusiastic' fighters took matters into their own hands when they came face to face with their former ruler.          

Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said: 'We wanted to keep him alive but the young guys, things went out of control.'      

However, few people in Libya say they are troubled by the manner of his death.
