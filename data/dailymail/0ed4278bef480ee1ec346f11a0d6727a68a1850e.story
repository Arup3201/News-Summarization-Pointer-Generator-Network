What happens when top skateboarders from all over the world are given unprecedented access to Helsinki Airport?

This video captures the fun tricks skateboarders from America, Japan, Russia, and Finland were able to perform alongside jumbo jets, after they were given a free pass to the airport.

The first-ever airport skate session was hosted by Arto Saari, a Finnish professional skateboarder and photographer.

For two days in October, top skateboarders came together to take over the Helsinki Airport in Finland

Invited by skateboarder and photographer Arto Saari, participants came from America, Japan and Russia

After letting the skaters loose, Saari stepped behind the lens to record some of their epic stunts.

From hangars to the airport bar and everywhere in between, the skateboarders turned every baggage reclaim turnstile and blast fence into their own personal playground. 

Passing travellers couldn't help but stop and stare in awe as the stunts unfolded all around them - some even as they were enjoying pints at the pub.

From airport hangars to the indoor pub and baggage reclaim turnstiles - nowhere was off-limits 

'Everything that we set up for it, we got the stuff we wanted and more,' Saari said of the project's success

The Helsinki Airport is widely regarded as the gateway between East and West - connecting Europe and America with Asia - so it's only appropriate that Saari bring top athletes from around the globe to this central meeting point.

The Arto Saari Invitational, as it was called, might have been the first of its time, but given it's success, it may not be its last. 

'Everything that we set up for it, we got the stuff we wanted and more,' Saari said.
