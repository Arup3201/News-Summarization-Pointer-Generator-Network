Three people have died, tens of thousands lost power, and hundreds of cars slid off roads a today after the Pacific Northwest was hit with a major snowfall.

The storm claimed the lives of a mother and her one-year-old son, their bodies pulled from an Oregon creek after their car was swept from a grocery store parking lot and a person killed by a falling tree east of Seattle.

Rescuers were searching yesterday for the Oregon child's mother, who was missing in the creek in the Willamette Valley community of Albany, about 70 miles south of Portland. She was later found dead.

Winter storm warning: Seattle was hit with snow and, more unusually, frozen rain, which hasn't happened since 1996

Washington Governor Chris Gregoire declared a state of emergency, authorizing the use of National Guard troops if necessary.

On
the icy interstate north of Seattle, a transportation department worker
responding to an accident was injured in crash. He was taken to a 
Seattle hospital; no details were available on his condition or how he 
was injured.

Freezing 
rain and ice pellets caused numerous accidents in the Seattle area, 
where drivers are mostly inexperienced with driving in snow or ice. The 
last widespread freezing rain in Seattle was in December 1996.

Oregon didn't receive the snowfall that Washington did – but got plenty of rain.

Rising water from heavy rains swept a car carrying four people into an overflowing creek in Albany.

Two
people – a father and his 5-year-old son – escaped, but the body of 
20-month-old Aiden McLaughlin was recovered and his mother, Catherine 
McLaughlin, was still missing.

‘The water just got high so fast,’ said Portland fire department spokeswoman Wanda Omdahl.

‘It's a big tragedy.’

The
damage is not limited to the northwest, however, as four central states
on reported tornadoes, the National Weather Service said.

A
cold front combined with a warm and humid air mass contributed to the 
unseasonable twisters which were also spotted in Tennessee, Indiana and 
Mississippi, Dan Pydynowski, senior meteorologist at AccuWeather.com 
said.

Damages reported from the twisters have been mostly to buildings, vehicles, power lines and trees 
while one injury was reported in Mississippi where a person suffered a 
possible broken arm after the tornado struck their home.

Around the unseasonable central states' weather, the Pacific 
Northwest is receiving its own pummel of 100mph winds and near-record 
snowfall in some areas Wednesday stacking up to 16in.

Sheltering from the winter weather in
the north east, parts of Oregon have seen winds reach as high as 
110mph, bringing much of the region to a standstill.

From
the Washington state capital in Olympia to the Oregon coast, schools 
were closed, roads were clogged with snow and hundreds of accidents and 
dozens of flights were cancelled.

Hitting hard: State troopers in the northwest reported 95 accidents in eight hours in what many residents dubbed 'Snowmageddon' while central states dodged 10 tornadoes

In an eight-hour period near the capital, there were 95 accidents, mostly spin outs, according to a state trooper.

The storm, nicknamed 'Snowmageddon' as 
it approached the Puget Sound region, proved less extreme than 
originally forecast, with the National Weather Service lowering its 
outlook for possible snow accumulations from up to ten inches to around 
six inches, meteorologist Dustin Guy said.

‘If
you get off the beaten path, you're in deep trouble,’ State Trooper Guy
Gill said. ‘I saw a guy in my rear mirror. I saw headlights and tail 
lights and headlights and tail lights again as he spun around off the 
road.’

‘For the first time in my career, I had to put chains on,’ he said. ‘You stay in the path laid down on the freeway.’

Making the best of it: Many schools in Washington and Oregon were given a snow day Thursday

Wreching havoc: Landslides occurred on roads in Tacoma, Washington due to the heavy rain and hail

Forecasters expect ‘good old rain back Friday and Saturday.'

But
warmer weather could lead to icy conditions, and Seattle officials 
urged people to find and clear street storm drains that could get 
clogged and cause severe flooding.

Olympia
had about a foot of new snow on the ground by 7.30am. The city could 
break its record of 14in of snow in a 24-hour period, Mr Colman said. 
Areas south of Olympia could get 20in. ‘They're getting hammered,’ Mr 
Colman said.

Tacoma had 
about seven inches of snow for the morning rush hour. Seattle had 
compact snow and ice on roads for commuters. Lesser amounts were 
reported north of Seattle.

Southeast Washington also is getting a good shot of snow with six to ten inches expected in the Palouse, meteorologist Colby Neuman said. ‘This will be right up with the most snow this season,’ Mr Neuman said. ‘This has been an un-snowy winter.'

High winds have begun hammering parts
of the Oregon coast and causing power outages, with reports of gusts of
100mph and more. There were no immediate reports of serious damage.

Heavy snow has been falling in Washington's mountains with up to two feet of fresh snow expected by Thursday. 

Interstate 90 across Snoqualmie Pass was shut down for much of Tuesday for avalanche control work.

Washington residents had plenty of 
warning as snow showers started over the weekend. With the heavy snow in
sight, Seattle and other school districts cancelled classes in advance.

Alaska Airlines

Seattle and Portland, Oregon, Several downtown Seattle hotels reported all 
their rooms were booked.

Elsewhere,
shoppers stocked up on groceries. Many courts and government offices 
and libraries closed. Garbage collection was postponed. Senator Patty 
Murray cancelled her event at a Tacoma company where she planned to talk
about employing veterans.

Pat
Hansen and her 17-year-old daughter, Emily, were taking photos of the 
growing piles of snow outside the Capitol in Olympia Wednesday morning.

‘I
love it,’ said Emily Hansen, who had the day off because Olympia High 
School was closed, along with most other schools in the region.

Her
mom's enthusiasm was more measured. ‘A day or two it's fun, but after a
while you start looking at accidents and slush and flooding,’ she said.

It was business as usual at the Capitol, where committee hearings were still being held, if not fully attended.

Some state employees drove into work, but others walked in, and at least one employee was seen cross-country skiing to the Capitol campus.

The 60-day legislative session began on January 9.

The governor could declare a state of emergency if conditions worsen, Reuters reports.
