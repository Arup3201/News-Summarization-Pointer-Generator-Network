A dog survived eight days in a building which had caught fire claiming the lives of two people. 

Zeus the dog went missing in Schenectady, New York state and ended up in an abandoned building which had been destroyed by a fire. 

The bodies of two men were found in the building. 

Chief of the local fire department Raymond Senecal told Wnyt.com that his officers spotted the dog peering out of a window and started the process of retrieving him.

Stacey Lyndon was delighted to be reunited with her dog Zeus who was missing for more than a week

Zeus was lured from the destroyed building by firefighters with the offer of a slice of pizza used as bait

He said: 'We were able to get up there and lure him out with a little bit of pizza of all things. He looks really happy. I think he's probably a little bit hungry. 

'I don't even know. It's incredible.'

The fact that the dog survived the inferno is the second piece of luck for Zues who was rescued by his owner Stacey Lydon who found him tied to a pole. 

She said: 'I never gave up hope. I really didn't. Without any signs of a body, I would never stop looking for him.' 

Sergeant Matt Dearing of Schenectady Police Department told Global News: 'Obviously crews are progressing, continuing to try to remove debris and attempting to locate any remains still left inside 104 Jay Street.'

The fire broke out as the area endured sub-zero temperatures to such an extent that water froze solid onto the fire fighters battling the blaze.

Three fire fighters were injured as was one person who leaped from the fifth floor to escape from the fire.   

The fire first broke out in a building across from city hall and spread next door. Both buildings had apartments on upper levels and commercial space on the ground floor.

The cause of the fire is unknown.

Chief Senacal said his officers were forced to shovel out snow which had buried several fire hydrants in a bid to battle the blaze.

Firefighters remained at the scene for almost 24 hours in an effort to extinguish the flames.
