These are the pictures that show how one man has followed his life's ambition to become 'the human platypus'.

Jenya Bolotov, 26, has spent seven years transforming his features - stretching eight parts of his face beyond recognition - to emulate the distinctive bill of a platypus.

He has stretched both of his ear lobes, his nostrils, septum and his top and bottom lip by more than nine-and-a-half inches altogether.

The Human Platypus: Jenya Bolotov, 26, has spent seven years transforming his body to become the human platypus by stretching eight parts of his face beyond recognition until they resemble a platypus bill

Wow: Mr Bolotov has stretched his ear, nostrils, septum and his lips by more than nine-and-a-half inches

He is also the only person in the world to have his 'Surna' - the very top bridge of his nose - stretched. 

The designer from Perm, Russia says he won't stop modifying his body until he realises his vision.

'I love platypus - the way they look and even the word "platypus" itself,' he said. 'I like the way my stretched face and lips now look like a platypus bill.

'All of the modifications I have added to my body make me feel whole. This is what I am now. It is what I have always wanted to be.'

Mr Bolotov said he was very shy as a child and felt like he didn't fit in with the people around him.

'I was a very quiet child. When I was a kid, I felt as if I didn't belong in this world. I felt like it wasn't my world and that I was looking at it as if from outside,' he explained.

'I knew that I would have to genuinely change myself and live differently to feel happy.'

Mr Bolotov first became aware of body modifications at the age of ten.

'When I saw body piercings for the first time on the internet, I became very interested. As I got older, I started learning about ear lobe stretching which was still very rare,' he said.

'I loved the way it looked - the way you could stretch your body to become who you want to be. It's such a beautiful art.'

When he reached 18 and adulthood, Mr Bolotov decided he would stretch his ear lobes himself. 'I had no knowledge of how to do it so I made a lot of mistakes with my earlobes. But it was the start of my journey,' he said.

After getting his first taste for cosmetic body modifications, he began to explore other body parts that he could hollow out.

'When I turned eighteen, I didn't know you could stretch anything else besides your ear lobes,' he said. 'But soon after I came across images of lip stretching in African countries and I liked them.

'Although I thought they were too small - I wanted my lip holes bigger. I wanted to take this ancient art to the next level.

'Then my friend said that if anyone could achieve a truly big, horizontal lip, they would look like a platypus. I wanted to be like that. I loved the large bill of a platypus.'

At nineteen, Mr Bolotov started the slow and painful process of stretching his own top and bottom lip to attain this appearance. He would also embark on stretching both his nostrils and septum to create that elongated, billed look.

Seven years later, he has finally achieved a permanent, stretched size of 58mm on his bottom lip and 33mm on his top lip. And he plans on steadily increasing these throughout his life.

'I would stretch my face and lips a little at a time and keep going. There was no limit,' he said. 'It has taken me years to get to where I am and now I feel like I finally belong in this world.

'Externally, I am now a platypus. My resemblance is the way I want it to be. Inside though, I am more like a bird. They're my spirit animal and they come to me in my dreams.'

In spite of his seemingly impractical body modifications, Jenya Bolotov they don't affect his day-to-day life.

'I can eat, talk and speak on the phone like everyone else. Nothing has changed at all,' he said.

'I do attract a lot of negative attention when I walk down the street and sometimes people make mean comments. I'm used to it now though and I just try to ignore them.'

However Mr Bolotov's unusual appearance has also won him a host of fans - who fondly call him 'The Human Platypus'.

He said: 'I get a lot of fan mail from people telling me they're grateful for what I do and how I look.

'Some individuals have written to me, saying they wish they were able to change their body the way I have.

'Not everyone is free like me - they have an internal battle inside them that makes them feel like they can't become who they want to be.

'It takes bravery to do what I've done and I will keep modifying my body until I am happy.'

Mr Bolotov is currently single but says there is a woman who he is in love with from afar.

'I do not have a girlfriend but there is a person I love very much. We're not in a relationship,' he said.

'I can be attracted to anyone whether they have body modifications or not. I hope there is not a particular 'type' of girl who finds me attractive either.'
