A cruel aunt faces jail after she cut off her three-year-old nephew's penis because he burst in on her in the loo and asked to use her phone.

Xue Paan, 37, attacked her nephew Qiang Qiang as she was supposed to be looking after him while his mother went to visit a neighbour in Luohe, a city in Henan Province, central China.

Xue was sitting on the toilet sending text messages to her boyfriend when the toddler walked in and asked if he could play a game on her mobile phone.

Innocent: Qiang Qiang walked in on his aunt as she was sending messages to her boyfriend and asked if he could play a game on her mobile phone. She reacted by getting a kitchen knife and slicing off his penis

Instead of giving him the phone, the aunt went into the kitchen, picked up a knife, then came back and sliced off the boy's penis.

She fled the house before his mother could return. 

Qiang Qiang's mother Cai Tuan, 27, said: 'I had popped out to see a neighbour and was only gone 30 minutes when I heard Qiang Qiang scream.

'I ran back to the house and couldn't believe what I saw.

'Qiang Qiang had fainted and was lying in a pool of blood.

'Next to him was a knife and his penis.

'It was simply horrific.

'My sister, his aunt, had gone.'

Qiang Qiang was rushed to hospital where surgeons managed to reattach his appendage and was then sent to a specialist clinic in the capital Beijing.

Pain and grief: The boy's distraught mother and father wait for their son to be treated at the hospital

A hospital spokesman said: 'Unfortunately, the knife was quite blunt and the cut wasn't clean so although we reattached the boy's penis, it wasn't ideal and he had to have further treatment.

'However, he has now had three surgeries all of which have been successful and we are confident that his penis will be perfectly OK again in three months.'

A police spokesman said: 'The aunt was arrested and admitted attacking the boy because she was angry that he had interrupted her on the toilet.'

She now faces 5 years in jail.
