NSW Premier Mike Baird announced his support for the clinical trial of medical marijuana on Tuesday

The legalisation of medical marijuana could become a reality sooner than expected in Australia as New South Wales becomes the second state after Victoria to support a clinical trial of the drug.

On Tuesday the NSW government announced their support for the trial, and this will bring the legal use of cannabis and other forms of the drug for sufferers of chronic illness one step closer.

Premier Mike Baird also declared his personal approval in parliament on Tuesday, and said he was moved by the story of 24-year-old Daniel Haslam, who has suffered with an agressive form of bowel cancer for the past four years.

'Why not take a stance to say to the rest of the country, this matters. It's time we did something about it,' Mr Baird told parliament, the ABC report.

'So I say at the same time, we want to give the terminally ill and those around them, their carers, their family, greater peace of mind.

'We also want to ensure that carers aren't forced to watch their loved ones suffer when their pain can be alleviated,' he continued.

A working group has already been established, and will look at issues surrounding supply, distribution, before delivering a report at the end of this year.

The government are also making the move to amend police guidelines so anyone found in possession of a small amount of marijuana who is on a register of terminally ill patients will not be charged. 

Labor has offered bipartisan support on the issue, and opposition leader John Robertson told the Sydney Morning Herald terminally ill people who wanted to use the drug for medicinal purposes: 'Should not suffer the further humiliation of being dragged through our courts and treated as criminals.'

Earlier this year before she addressed parliament about the issue Daily Mail Australia spoke to Lucy Haslam, Daniel's mother, about the relief that marijuana has brought to her son's life.

Mrs Haslam, a retired nurse, and her husband Lou, a former police officer, have watched their son Daniel deteriorate from a fit and high achieving student to a frail and depressed young man. 

In a speech that Mrs Haslam delivered to Parliament House in Canberra in June, she detailed how her youngest son desperately clings to the hope and relief that illegal cannabis offers him.

While Daniel continues his four year fight with cancer, the effects of chemotherapy have been detrimental.

Cannabis provides solace for Daniel, unlike others such as antiemetic drugs which are supposed to relieve him from nausea and vomiting induced by cancer treatment.

Mrs Haslam told ABC on Tuesday she was beside herself when she was notified of Mr Baird's decision.

'I think I gave him a big hug and a kiss. He's a very kind, caring man, you know he's a dad,' she said.

'I think he probably knows as any parent the horrible feeling of watching your child suffer and feeling powerless. He can empathise with that I think,' Mrs Haslam added.

Mr Haslam has been suffering from bowel cancer for four years and has severe side effects from chemotherapy which cannabis helps to alleviate

Just last month the Victorian opposition leader Daniel Andrews said cannabis should be available for people who needed treatment in exceptional circumstances.

Labor wants to legalise cannabis oil for the treatment of conditions such as cancer, multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS, glaucoma and Parkinson's Disease. He said the same rules would not apply for recreational use.

'In some cases, parents are forced to choose between breaking the law and watching their child suffer," Mr Andrews said.

'Children are in pain, families are suffering, people are living in fear, and outdated laws are getting in the way.'

The move follows public campaigns by Victorian families who have successfully treated their chronically ill children when other medicines have not worked.
