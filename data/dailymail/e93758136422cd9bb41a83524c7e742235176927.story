Two Al Jazeera journalists sentenced to seven years in jail over alleged terrorism offences have been released on bail after spending more than a year behind bars in Egypt. 

Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed were imprisoned after being arrested alongside Australian reporter Peter Greste in Cairo in 2013.

The men were convicted of spreading lies to assist a terrorist organisation, namely the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, and sentenced for to up to 10 years each.

Canadian Mohamed Fahmy (left) was told to pay $33,000 by a judge as he set conditions of bail this morning. He and Baher Mohamed (right) have spent more than 400 days behind bars 

All three have maintained their innocence, claiming they were merely covering the fallout from the army's removal of President Mohamed Morsi in July 2013 at the time. 

Last week Egypt's highest court ordered a retrial into their case, claiming the prosecution had not presented firm ties between the defendants and the Brotherhood throughout the original trial.

Greste was released from jail under at the order of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi citing a new law which allows the deportation of foreign prisoners.

Neither Fahmy nor Mohammed was given the same fate, though both were released on bail at a court in Cairo this morning, the former ordered to pay $33,000. 

None of the other 11 defendants, mostly students, were ordered to pay the court any money. They are all Egyptian nationals.

Upon his release this morning, Fahmy's fiancée Marwa Omara broke down in tears, weeping: 'Long live justice.' 

Australian journalist Peter Greste was released under presidential decree last week. The former BBC correspondent said it was now 'his job' to ensure his colleagues release

Following his imprisonment in December 2013, Fahmy applied to marry Miss Omara in prison. 

His release allows them to tie the knot, though his fiancée said she would not be entirely satisfied until her partner was acquitted. 

'I am very happy. It is a rebirth for me and Mohamed. 

'I am happy but my happiness is incomplete until he gets acquitted.' 

Last week the 40-year-old journalist described the notion of retrial as 'his worst nightmare' in a statement released on his behalf.

Amal Clooney, the international human rights lawyer, is representing the journalists

He is represented by international human rights lawyer Amal Clooney who was herself threatened with arrest in relation to the case last month.

Mrs Clooney, who married Hollywood actor George Clooney last year, was warned against publishing a report which criticised the Egyptian judicial system. 

Her findings suggested the country's courts were not sufficiently independent of its military. 

Upon the defendants' bail yesterday, Mrs Clooney said: 'I am encouraged by the Supreme Court’s findings that the trial was unfair, and by today’s ruling granting Mr Fahmy bail. 

'At the same time, there is no guarantee that a retrial will be carried out in compliance with international standards or result in the full acquittal on all charges that Fahmy deserves. 

'It may also take several months to complete.

'So this case is not over yet; but it should be.'

On January 15, a statement released on behalf of Mr Fahmy by  Doughty Street Chambers, where Mrs Clooney works, highlighted the inability of the Canadian government to secure his release. 

The former CNN journalist, who has dual Canadian and Egyptian nationality, said: 'My situation and the ongoing legal limbo that I am enduring affects all Canadians who are in the Middle East because it shows that anyone, regardless of how innocent, can become a victim of the political turbulence here. 

'And rest assured there will be other Canadians who will suffer like me as long as there is such injustice in this region. 

'Canada and Egypt have friendly relations and so I hope you will continue to advocate until the diplomatic process results in my release. 

'It is vital that Ottawa continues to engage with my lawyers Amal Clooney and Lorne Waldman at this critical stage of the negotiations so that my colleagues and I can achieve a smooth transition to freedom.'

Upon his release last week, Australian journalist Peter Greste said he felt compelled to secure the men's freedom. 

The men were arrested on December 29, 2013, accused of assisting the Muslim Brotherhood in their coverage of the aftermath of the ousting of President Morsi. 

They denied having any hand in terrorism, consistently claiming that they fulfilling their roles as journalists in reporting the conflict in Cairo.
