He was axed by Channel 4 after his offensive humour prompted a flood of complaints.

Now comedian Frankie Boyle could return to mainstream  television... on the BBC.

The corporation’s ‘controller of comedy commissioning’ Shane Allen – who joined from Channel 4 last year – said he wants the controversial Scot back on screens.

Mr Allen caused uproar in 2011 when, as Channel 4’s head of comedy, he said a Boyle chat show was ‘very much like Parkinson or Wogan, but with paedo jokes’.

The show, Frankie Boyle’s Rehabilitation Programme, was never made because the comic lost his job after mocking model Katie Price’s disabled son on air.

Now Mr Allen, 40, has said he is looking for the ‘right vehicle’ to bring Boyle to the BBC, meaning the show could be screened at licence-payers’ expense.

He added: ‘For me, Frankie shares the same provocative, edgy comedy danger Billy Connolly had early in his career.’

Mr Allen joked that he would love to see Boyle host The One Show, BBC1’s family-friendly topical magazine aired at 7pm.

The 40-year-old comedian was axed from the BBC’s Comic Relief schedule this month after he said he wished the Queen had died.

Yesterday, the BBC insisted it had no current plans for Boyle.

A spokesman said: ‘Shane’s comment was purely speculative.’
