Terminated: Gresham Elementary School Principal Tom Klansnic claims he is losing his job of 10 years because of his sexual orientation

A beloved elementary school principal in Oregon claims he's being forced from the job after coming out as gay sparking anger among parents but no comment from his school district.

Tom Klansnic has worked as principal of North Gresham Elementary School for the last 10 years but this year will be his last according to a vote by the school board last week without a reason for his abrupt termination cited.

During his seventh year as principal in 2010, Mr Klansnic and his wife divorced with him soon after revealing to family and friends that he is gay.

It's after that admission, his attorney Judy Snyder says, that his supervisors treatment toward him dramatically changed.

‘He's
been a very successful principal and he's continued to be a very 
successful principal even under close scrutiny of the last two years,’ 
Ms Snyder told KOIN.

Before that, the suburban Portland district had twice renewed his contract without performance complaints, said Ms Snyder.

'He's
had a great deal of difficulty getting specifics as to what he has 
failed to do to meet performance expectations,' she said.

Officials of the Gresham Barlow School District said they couldn't comment because it's a personnel matter.

'I think it is unfortunate,' parent Denise McCloud told the Associated Press on Thursday during a public vote by the school board that reaffirmed his termination. 'I don't see how anyone's sexual orientation has anything to do with the job that they do.'

Capri Parker, president of the school's parent-teacher group also agrees saying that nothing in his job performance which she has access to would suggest an issue.

'He is a fabulous principal. My kids have loved him... I have seen everything he has done and built at this school,' she told the Oregonian.

Support: Mr Klanscnic's supporters have since created a Facebook page, pictured, and a Change.org petition, both receiving more than 400 supporters

She believes Mr Klansnic's belief of being terminated because of his sexual orientation is credible.

Last spring the school board voted not to extend his three-year contract. On Thursday the board reaffirmed that decision in a public vote that was taken without public discussion.

Without Mr Klansnic’s supporters’ voices permitted on the floor, they instead showed their support by showing up to the vote in pink T-shirts from an anti-bullying campaign held earlier in the day at the school. It was a platform the principal himself had initiated.

As of Wednesday morning a Change.org petition to save Mr Klansnic job had received more than 444 signatures.

The page appears covered with comments in support of Mr Klansnic, many sharing their personal experience with him.

'Tom is a top notch professional. He loves and is loved by his students. My son 
is a first grader at North Gresham, and my 17 year old went there when he was a 
grade schooler,' a Change.org user writes. 'Mr. K is and has been a positive presence at the school. It is a 
terrible decision that the GBSD is making in not extending his contract.'

Ms Snyder says the school board has been notified that Mr Klansnic is considering a discrimination suit that includes working in a hostile work environment and retaliation.

Mr Klansnic was not at the meeting on Thursday but in a text message to the Associated Press said that being principal was a dream job.

'The teachers, kids, and parents at NORTH GRESHAM GRADE SCHOOL are an awesome group of people,' it read.

He says that after his 24th year in education he plans to continue working in the field even after his planned dismissal this spring.
