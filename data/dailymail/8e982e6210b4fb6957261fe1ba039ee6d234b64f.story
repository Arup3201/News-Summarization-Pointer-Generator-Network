Thailand's crown prince has revoked the royally-assigned family name of his wife, following the arrest of several of her relatives  in a high profile corruption case. 

Crown prince Maha Vajiralongkorn is understood to have issued the directive after three people with the royal-appointed surname Akharaphongpreecha were among a group arrested in a crackdown on alleged police corruption.

The office of Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, 62, issued a statement on Friday ordering the Interior Ministry to strip the family of Princess Srirasmi, 42, of the royal-appointed surname.

Families can be given an honorary name by the Thai monarchy in return for their loyal service. The name was appointed to Princess Srirasmi after the couple married in 2001. The couple have a nine-year-old son. 

'Individuals using the royal-appointed last name must change back to their old family name,' the office said in the statement.

The investigation has led to a lot of interest in the Thai royal family. 

However news about the monarchy is heavily filtered by the palace. Under the lese-majeste laws, the world's harshest, anything deemed an insult or a threat to the monarchy is punishable by up to 15 years in prison.

A total of 19 people were arrested in the crackdown on corruption, which led to raids that seized tens of millions of dollars in assets. 

Among those arrested was Police Lieutenant General Pongpat Chayaphan, a former head of Thailand's Central Investigation Bureau. Pongpat and several others were also charged for allegedly citing the monarchy for personal benefit.

Thailand has increasingly applied its lese-majeste laws since a military coup in May, although it is rare for high-ranking officials to fall afoul of them.

Prayuth Chan-ocha, the former army chief who led the coup and was appointed prime minister in August, is a self-proclaimed royalist and has vowed to root out critics of the monarchy.

Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn is the first in line to the throne. His father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who is widely revered by Thais, is 86.
