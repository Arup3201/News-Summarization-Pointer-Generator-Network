A streaker standing naked on a highway central reservation in Kazakhstan got a bizarre comeuppance when an airgun-toting gang shot him in the backside.

Oddball footage posted online records the drive-by shooting with an air rifle as the 27-year-old victim - later identified as Yuri Baiseitov - stands in the buff on a road's grass central reservation in Shymkent.

And to add insult to his injury, police in the southern Kazakh city say that while they have no idea who the anonymous gunmen were, they will definitely be charging Baiseitov with indecent exposure.

Ouch! Streaker Yuri Baiseitov clutches his bum cheek after he's shot with an air-rifle by louts in a passing car

Yowee! It is not known why Baiseitov was standing naked on the highway in Shymkent, Kazakhstan

Why, you! Baiseitov spins around to catch a glimpse of his assailants, who posted footage of the attack online

The video, taken from the assailants' car, shows the late-night scene where Baiseitov is standing naked in the middle of the road.

After first spotting him, the car makes a U-turn to get a better shot at their target. The gunman says to the driver: 'He's driving me crazy. Turn right here. Wait, go on a little bit.'

Then, as he opens fire at hapless, naked Baiseitov, the gunman launches into a vile tirade, screaming: 'Get the f*** out of here, f*** your mum. Get out of here quickly. Quicker f*** it you faggot.'

Baiseitov's squeals of pain an be heard on the soundtrack as at least three shots hit him in the rear end and elsewhere on his body.

Police spokesman Volt Beralin said later: 'While is is against the law to discharge firearms in this way, he [Baiseitov] should not have been where he was doing what he was doing.'

He added: 'We have not established the gunman's identity but we do know who they were shooting at and he may be charged with indecent exposure.'
