Iraq's new president has snubbed the powerful incumbent Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki by nominating the deputy parliament speaker to form the new government.

But the move raises fears of more infighting in the government as the country faces the threat of Sunni militants in the north.

A member of al-Maliki's political bloc said 'we will not stay silent' over the decision.

Hussein al-Maliki, Maliki's son-in-law said: 'The nomination is illegal and a breach of the constitution. We will go to the federal court to object to the nomination.'

Al-Maliki had indicated he would seek
 a third term as prime minister, rejecting calls by Sunnis, Kurds, 
fellow Shi'ites and regional power broker Iran to step aside for a less 
polarising figure who can unite Iraqis against a raging Sunni insurgeny.

In
 a televised address, Fouad Massoum gave Haider al-Ibadi 30 days to form
 a new government and present it to parliament for approval, expressing 
his hope he would succeed.

Mr
 Ibadi, who pledged to form a government to 'protect the Iraqi people', 
was nominated for the post by the Iraqi National Alliance, a coalition 
of Shi'ite parties that Mr Maliki's State of Law is part of, but has 
turned against him.

Mr 
Maliki's Shi'ite-dominated bloc won the most parliament seats in April 
elections and the prime minister sees himself as rightfully keeping the 
post.

In a midnight speech, 
Mr Maliki said he was filing a suit against the president for neglecting
 to name him prime minister by Sunday's deadline and all but demanded he
 be renominated.

Critics say
 Mr Maliki, a Shiite, contributed to the crisis by monopolising power 
and pursuing a sectarian agenda that alienated the country's Sunni and 
Kurdish minorities.

Mr 
Ibadi's nomination came hours after Mr Maliki deployed his elite 
security forces in the streets of Baghdad, partially closed two main 
streets - popular spots for pro and anti-government rallies - as 
hundreds of his supporters took to the streets.

'We are with you, al-Maliki,' they shouted, waving posters of the incumbent premier, singing and dancing.

Mohammed
 al-Ogeili, a lawmaker from Mr Maliki's list, rejected the nomination of
 Mr Ibadi arguing that this move 'runs against the constitution' because
 Mr Maliki's party is the largest bloc and the National Alliance has no 
right to present any candidate.

'This decision would lead the country to a big problem and the president bears full responsibility for this situation,' he said.

After Washington endorsed Masoum's attempts to break three months of post-election political deadlock that have hamstrung Baghdad's response to the Islamic State, Secretary of State John Kerry called on Maliki not to resort to force or 'stir the waters' when Iraqis were seeking a change of leader.

In pointed remarks, he said: 'The government formation process is critical in terms of sustaining stability and calm in Iraq and our hope is that Mr Maliki will not stir those waters.

'There will be little international support of any kind whatsoever for anything that deviates from the legitimate constitution process that is in place and being worked on now.'

As police and elite armed units, many equipped and trained by the United States, locked down the capital's streets, Kerry added: 'There should be no use of force, no introduction of troops or militias in this moment of democracy for Iraq.'

President Barack Obama warned Americans on Saturday that the new campaign to bring security in Iraq requires military and political changes and 'is going to be a long-term project.'

Obama said Iraqi security forces need to revamp to effectively mount an offensive, which requires a government in Baghdad that the Iraqi military and people have confidence in.

Obama said Iraq needs a prime minister - an indication that suggests he's written off the legitimacy of the incumbent, al-Maliki.

Critics say the Shi'ite leader 
contributed to the crisis by monopolizing power and pursuing a sectarian
 agenda that alienated the country's Sunni and Kurdish minorities.

Just hours after al-Maliki's speech, the U.S. State Department said Sunday it 'fully supports' the new Iraqi president.

State
 Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement the U.S. supports 
the process to select a prime minister 'by building a national consensus
 and governing in an inclusive manner.'

She said the U.S. rejects any effort to use coercion or manipulation in the process of choosing a new Iraqi leader.

The U.S. airstrikes have reinvigorated Kurdish forces battling the Islamic State militants in northern and western Iraq.

On the run: The Yazidis said Islamic State militants had given them the choice of converting to Islam or dying

Kurdish forces retook two towns from the Sunni militants on Sunday, achieving one of their first victories after weeks of retreating, a senior Kurdish military official said.

Kurdish peshmerga fighters were able to push the militants of the Islamic State group out of the villages of Makhmour and al-Gweir, some 28 miles (45 kilometers) from the Kurdish capital of Irbil, Brigadier General Shirko Fatih said.

The United States launched a fourth round of airstrikes Sunday against militant vehicles and mortars firing on Irbil as part of efforts to blunt the militants' advance and protect American personnel in and around the Kurdish capital.

U.S. warplanes and drones have also attacked militants firing on minority Yazidis around Sinjar, which is in the far west of the country near the Syrian border.

In the Kurdish capital on Sunday, the president of the semi-autonomous Kurdish Regional Government, Massoud Barzani, said American military support has been effective thus far, but, he added, peshmerga soldiers require more firepower to defeat the militants.

'We are not asking our friends to send their sons to fight on our behalf,' Barzani told The Associated Press in a brief interview.

'What we are asking our friends is to provide us support and to co-operate with us in providing us with heavy weapons that we are able to fight this terrorist group.'

Barzani met Sunday with French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who travelled to Baghdad and Irbil pledging France's commitment to providing humanitarian aid.

Fabius also met with al-Maliki and called on Iraqi leaders to unite in the face of the escalating crisis.

'The marching order is solidarity,' Fabius said.

He called on Iraqis to form a 'government of broad unity so that all Iraqis feel represented and together lead the battle against terrorism.'

A week ago, Al-Maliki ordered the Iraqi air force to support Kurdish forces against the militants, in a rare instance of co-operation between Baghdad and the Kurdish regional government, which have for years been locked in disputes over oil and territory.

Meanwhile, thousands of Yazidi refugees fleeing the militants continued to pour across the border from in Syria after a week-long journey through blazing hot mountains.

Followers of an ancient religion with links to Zoroastrianism, the Yazidis said the militants had given them the choice of converting to Islam or dying.

As they crossed the border, many Yazidis said they had lost sisters, daughters, young children and elderly parents during the trip.

They said militants sprayed gunfire at fleeing crowds, sometimes splitting up families by taking the women and killing the men.

It was not clear how many Yazidis were missing.

In the span of 30 minutes, about a dozen displaced Yazidis approached one journalist, pleading for assistance to find their loved ones.

British officials estimated Saturday that 50,000 to 150,000 people could be trapped on Sinjar Mountain, where they fled to escape the Islamic extremists, only to become stranded there with few supplies.

Britain said its air force has already dropped water containers and solar lanterns over the mountains.

U.S. and Iraqi aircraft also have dropped humanitarian aid for the minority Yazidism.

U.S. Central Command reported that the U.S. military conducted a fourth airdrop of food and water Sunday.

During his Sunday blessing at the Vatican, Pope Francis expressed outrage at the violence aimed at religious minorities in Iraq and called on the world 'to stop these crimes.'

He cited 'the thousands of people, including Christians, who have been brutally forced from their homes, children who have died from thirst during the escape and women who have been seized.'

He also spoke of 'the destruction of religious, historic and cultural treasures.'

In a statement issued Sunday, the European Union said it was 'appalled by the rapid deterioration of the humanitarian situation, with hundreds of thousands civilians, mainly from minorities, fleeing the areas of conflict.'

Some of the militants' acts 'may constitute crimes against humanity and must be investigated swiftly, so that the perpetrators are held accountable,' the EU said.
