Witnesses say they spotted fire coming from a Cobham Aviation plane after it took off from Perth Airport this morning

The flight was scheduled to take-off at 10.45am from Perth Domestic Airport and was bound for Barrow Island

The flight, filled with FIFO workers, was on its way to Barrow Island when the emergency landing request was made.

The plane landed safely and the fire was put out by the airportâ€™s fire brigade, an airport spokeswoman said.

Matt Pilat, 28, was on Miles Road, Kewdale when he saw the plane overhead. His photos captured the flames coming from the middle of the aircraft.

â€˜As the plane flew overhead we saw the left engine on fire and it progressively got bigger as it flew overhead,â€™ Mr Pilat told Perth Now.

Passengers told 6PR that they were not overly worried by the emergency landing and trusted the flight crew would land safely.

Witnesses have posted photos on social media and said the plane circled the airport several times before landing.

Cobham is a regional aircraft carrier.

The aircraft is undergoing assessment at the airport.
