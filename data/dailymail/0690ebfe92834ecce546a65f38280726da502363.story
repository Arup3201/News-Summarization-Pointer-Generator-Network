He was hundreds of miles from civilisation, lost in the burning heat of the desert.

Second World War Flight Sergeant Dennis Copping took what little he could from the RAF Kittyhawk he had just crash-landed, then wandered into the emptiness.

From that day in June 1942 the mystery of what happened to  the dentist’s son from Southend was lost, in every sense, in the sands of time.

Shifting sands: The final resting place of the Kittyhawk P-40 has been discovered in the Sahara 70 years after it crashed there

Time capsule: Aside from the damage it sustained during impact, the aircraft appears to have been almost perfectly preserved in the sands of the Sahara

Chance discovery: The single-seater aircraft was found by a Polish oil company worker exploring a remote region of the western desert in Egypt

But 70 years later, the ghostly remains of his battered but almost perfectly preserved plane has been discovered.

Like a time capsule that could provide
 the key to his disappearance, it had lain intact alongside a makeshift 
shelter Dennis appears to have made as he waited, hopelessly, for 
rescue.

Now a search is to begin for the 
airman’s remains – as aviation experts and historians begin an operation
 to recover and display the P-40 aircraft in his memory.

The chance find was made by an oil 
worker exploring a remote region of the Western Desert in Egypt. It is 
more than 200 miles from the nearest town in a vast expanse of largely 
featureless terrain.

Flight Sergeant Copping, part of a 
fighter unit based in Egypt during the North Africa campaign against 
Rommel, is believed to have lost his bearings while flying the damaged 
Kittyhawk to another airbase for repair. All that is known is that he 
went off course and was never seen again.

At the controls: The plane's cockpit, but there are fears over what will be left of it after locals began stripping parts and instruments for souvenirs and scrap

Unseen and untouched: Equipment and controls from the plane were found scattered around the craft at the crash site. The plane is still in very good condition

Intact: Most of the plane's cockpit instruments were untouched and it still had it guns and ammunition before they were seized by the Egyptian military for safety reasons

Remarkably, the plane remained almost 
untouched for the next seven decades – right down to the guns and 
ammunition found with it. Most of the cockpit instruments are intact, 
and the twisted propeller lies a few feet from the fuselage.

Crucially, the P-40’s identification plates are untouched – allowing researchers to track its provenance and service history.

There is flak damage in the fuselage, 
which is consistent with documents on the aircraft. Historian Andy 
Saunders said: ‘It is a quite incredible time capsule. It’s the  
aviation equivalent of Tutankhamun’s tomb.

‘This plane has been lying in the same spot where it crashed 70 years ago.

‘It hasn’t been hidden in the sand, it has just sat there.

‘He must have survived the crash 
because one photo shows a parachute around the frame of the plane and my
 guess is the poor bloke used it to shelter from the sun. The radio and 
batteries were out of the plane and it looks like he tried to get it 
working.

Second World War weaponry: The machine gun on the wing of the crashed plane. It appears the pilot got into trouble and brought it down in the middle of the desert

Bullet holes: The Kittyhawk appears to have been shot at (left), while its broken propeller lays nearby (right). Historians have described the find as the 'aviation equivalent of Tutankhamun's Tomb'

Well-preserved: The Kittyhawk's magazine of bullets were also found in the wreckage. The radio and batteries were discovered out of the plane

‘If he died at the side of the plane 
his remains would have been found. Once he had crashed there, nobody was
 going to come and get him. It is more likely he tried to walk out of 
the desert but ended up walking to his death. It is too hideous to 
contemplate.’

The RAF Museum in Hendon, North 
London, has been made aware of the find and plans are already under way 
to recover it before anyone tries to strip it for scrap or souvenirs. 
Efforts have also been made to trace any immediate members of Flight 
Sergeant Copping’s family in the UK, but it is believed that none 
survives.

Captain Paul Collins, British defence 
attaché to Egypt, confirmed a search would be mounted for the airman’s 
remains but admitted it was ‘extremely unlikely’ it would be successful.
 The spot could be marked as a war grave after the aircraft is 
recovered.

Heading home: The RAF Museum at Hendon, north London, has been made aware of the discovery and plans are underway to recover the aircraft for exhibition in the future

Sign of the time: The Kittyhawk's factory stamp (left) and gun loading instruction panel (right). However, some locals see the aircraft as a piece of junk

Signs of survival: Flight Sergeant Dennis Copping's parachute was part of what is believed to be a makeshift camp alongside the fuselage

Remote: The crash site is about 200 miles from the nearest town. No human remains have been found but it is thought the pilot's decomposed body may lay anywhere in a 20 mile radius of the plane

Captain Collins added: ‘The scene is close to a smuggling line from Sudan and Libya.

‘We will need to go there with the Egyptian army because it is a dangerous area.’

Ian Thirsk, of the RAF Museum, confirmed staff are working with the MoD to recover the plane.

The P-40 was a US-made fighter and 
ground attack aircraft. It was outclassed by later German fighters and 
saw little combat in Europe but performed a key role in North Africa  
and Asia where high-altitude performance was less critical. Around 20 
are still airworthy.
