A fisherman who survived a shark bite on vacation said the ordeal is his latest brush with death after previously being struck by lightning and getting attacked by snakes and even monkeys.

Erik Norrie lost part of his leg after being bitten by a shark while fishing off the Abaco Islands in the Bahamas in front of his wife Spryng, four daughters and father-in-law.

But Mr Norrie, from Largo, Florida, said the horrifying attack that has left him needing skin grafts to his damaged leg is only the latest in a string of rare incidents.

Erik Norrie was attacked by a shark while vacationing in the Bahamas after previously surviving a lightning strike, a snake bite and being punched by monkeys twice

The back of his leg was bitten while he was fishing and Mr Norrie is now waiting for skin graft surgery

He has previously been struck by lightning, survived a rattlesnake bite and said he has been punched by monkeys twice.

The odds of being attacked by a shark are about one in 11.5million and the chances of being struck by lightning in the U.S. is about one in 280,000.

Despite his numerous brushes with death, Mr Norrie said it was the shark attack that he believed was going to kill him.

He said he felt a crunch on the back of his leg during the trip on July 29 as he was returning to the family boat after snorkeling and spearfishing in the ocean.

The father-of-four, pictured at Tampa General Hospital with a toy shark given by a friend, was able to tie rubber bands around his leg to stem the blood flow after the attack

Mr Norrie told Fox Tampa Bay:
'As I look back, [the shark] was just finishing his bite and ripping 
and swimming off, and you could see a piece of my leg in his mouth.'

He said the shark began circling through the pool of blood when his father-in-law jumped into the water to get between him and the predator.

Mr Norrie told the news station: 'I immediately threw the spear down with the fish because there was an enormous pool of blood around me and that shark was swimming all through the blood, sort of looking around, for more.'

The father-of-four was able to tie rubber bands from his spear around his leg to try and stem the blood flow and his family called for help over the radio.

Despite his numerous brushes with death, Mr Norrie said it was the shark attack, off the Abaco Islands, in the Bahamas (pictured), that he thought was going to kill him

A San Diego doctor arrived and accompanied Mr Norrie to a local hospital.

The fisherman said: 'That was a tough ride. I really did think I was going to die.'

The devout Christian credits his faith with helping him through the ordeal and said his daughters and wife prayed during the journey to hospital.

Mr Norrie, who has been spearfishing since he was eight years old, is now recovering at Tampa General Hospital and is due to have multiple skin grafts to try to repair his injured leg.
