The playboy son of Britain’s first black Cabinet minister was jailed for almost four years yesterday after sexually assaulting a sleeping woman.

Benjamin Boateng enjoyed a champagne lifestyle, partying with celebrities including Amy Winehouse and Tracey Emin.

But the 27-year-old, whose father is Lord Boateng, was a sexual predator who believed he had a ‘proprietary right’ to women.

Judge Fergus Mitchell said the former actor’s arrogance towards women led him to do as he pleased with them.

The court heard the celebrity 
entertainment agent assaulted a 22-year-old stranger while she was ‘dead
 to the world’ after passing out in an alcoholic stupor.

His victim, now 23, wept as she told 
how she was attacked by Boateng at a house party after a night out 
clubbing with friends on September 19 last year.

When she fell asleep on a sofa, drunk on champagne and vodka, Boateng climbed on top of her and yanked down her underwear.

Hiding under a quilt, he exposed 
himself and sexually assaulted her.

Woken by the attack, she screamed: 
‘How can you do that when I was asleep? I don’t know who you are.’

Icah Peart QC, defending, said his 
client was a ‘true gentleman’ with a ‘gentle nature and a routine 
consideration towards women’.

He added: ‘He is a man of exceptional character.’

But sentencing Boateng at Kingston 
Crown Court in West London yesterday, Judge Mitchell said he had ‘taken 
the opportunity to satisfy his own sexual gratification after 
identifying a vulnerable female’.

The judge added: ‘You have a degree of
 arrogance. I wonder if you do not feel you have some sort of 
proprietary right to do as you please.

‘She was obviously a vulnerable victim. She was asleep. You thought you could go ahead and do this.

‘Perhaps you didn’t think of the consequences, but what spurred you on was perhaps that attitude you had.

‘At the end of the day it has to be 
imprisonment... because of the circumstances and the principle that no 
woman should be treated this way.’

Boateng, who has appeared on The Bill and Grange Hill, was jailed for three years and ten months.

He will also have to sign the sex offenders register.

He was found guilty of sexual assault by a majority jury verdict of 10-2 last month.

Yesterday it emerged that Boateng, of 
Marylebone, Central London, was cautioned in March last year for 
harassment after sending a former girlfriend unpleasant text messages.

And in 2006 he was cleared of raping 
an 18-year-old girl twice in South Africa, where his father Paul was 
Britain’s High Commissioner.

Lord Boateng, 60, who was Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 2002 to 2005, declined to comment.
