These pictures show France's latest weapon against the growing menace of rogue drones buzzing through their nation's skies: another drone, with a net.

In a demonstration flight in La Queue-en-Brie, east of Paris, the mesh-wielding flying machine was shown snaring a DJI Phantom 2 drone - the same brand as one which crashed onto the White House lawn last month.

The U.S. Secret Service was sent scrambling by the unexpected intrusion, but France has already faced dozens of drone overflights over sensitive sites. Mystery drones have buzzed nuclear plants, military installations and even the presidential palace in recent months, as fears run high of terrorist attacks linked to the Middle East's Islamic State insurgency.

Growing problem: After a spate of mystery overflights at sensitive locations, including nuclear sites, French officials recently asked scientists to devise ways to counter drones and detect their remote control pilots

Snared: Malou Tech's Interceptor merely drops a net over its prey, but officials are asking scientists for ways to monitor and detect intruding drones as well as analyse and track their flight paths

Concerned at the new technology, officials have asked scientists and companies to develop ways to monitor and detect intruding drones and their remote-control pilots; analyse and track their flight paths; and ultimately neutralise the drones, either temporarily or permanently, with the least collateral damage possible.

Books closed on bids for the drone interception system last week, but so far it seems those lofty goals have not been realised. Indeed, the maker of the six-bladed drone with the net demonstrated yesterday for an Associated Press photographer has not even bothered to put itself forward.

'This is a technology phenomenon, not an aeronautical phenomenon', Philippe Dubus, head of drone maker Malou Tech, told the AP, adding 'within 18 months, whatever they come up with will be obsolete already.'

Gotcha! Malou Tech pilot Philippe Dardini brings his drone Interceptor MP200 back to earth after it snared the DJI Phantom 2 drone. Malou Tech, a small drone-focused start-up, has not bid for the government work

Civilian drones have become a 21st-century hobby for many, from high-tech aficionados to curious kids, and a hot seller. Companies like Amazon even want to use drones for deliveries. But their increasing presence in the skies gives headaches to national security chiefs.

For months, France has faced dozens of drone overflights over sensitive sites — mostly nuclear facilities, a worrisome development in a country that gets the highest percentage of its energy in the world from atomic power.

French authorities say the drones currently present no threat. But some fear the drones could be spying on French technology or could one day be equipped with bombs or other weapons. Authorities have stepped up security at French nuclear sites and are investigating who might be behind the drone flights.

The possible risks of rogue drones include terrorism, the invasion of privacy, the theft of industry secrets, and 'damage to the credibility of public authorities, institutions or companies,' said France's National Research Agency.

A French security official said Germany, Britain, France and the U.S. were among the countries confronting the drone issue. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak publicly on the matter.

State media in China say Chinese scientists have already developed a laser weapon that can detect and shoot down small, low-flying and slow-moving aircraft inside a 1.2-mile radius.

Other anti-drone devices could include pinpoint radar systems to track drones the size of a breadbasket or even smaller (and distinguish them from birds); high-tech lasers to destroy the unwanted intruders or telecommunications-scrambling systems to block the remote controls that direct them.

Interception drones, like the one made by Malou Tech, could be sent up into the sky to fight back and low-tech solutions such as sky-high netting or fences could also work, officials say.

'In other words, everything is possible,' said Mr Dubus.
