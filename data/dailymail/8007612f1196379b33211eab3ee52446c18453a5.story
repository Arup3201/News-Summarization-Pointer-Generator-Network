Johnny Cash's 44-year-old son was arrested in Newfoundland, Canada on Monday after stripping nude in an airport terminal while waiting to catch a flight home. 

John Carter Cash, the only son of the country music legend and his second wife June Carter, was returning home to Tennessee from a hunting trip when the incident happened Monday afternoon.

Police were called to Deer Lake airport around 2:10pm for reports of a man taking his clothes off in the terminal.

By the time local authorities arrived at the scene, security had convinced Cash to put his clothes back on and ascertained that he was inebriated.

Cash was held in police custody until he was sober, missing his flight. He was rebooked on another flight and scheduled to return home Tuesday morning.

Police arrested Cash for disturbing the peace and public intoxication, but reportedly will not press formal charges since Cash was cooperative and has no previous criminal record.

Security said few people actually witnessed the event.

Cash's arrest is an unfortunate case of history repeating, since his father also struggled with alcohol abuse. 

The country star was in and out of rehab for most of his career. His last stint in rehab was in 1992 at a center in Loma Linda, California. Several months later, his son followed him to the facility for treatment as well. 

Johnny Cash died in 2003, just four months after the death of wife June.  

The two met backstage at the Grand Ole Opry in 1955, and were married 13 years later in 1968. 

When they first met, Cash was married to Vivian Liberto, with whom he had four daughters.

The couple divorced in 1966, with Liberto citing Cash's drug and alcohol abuse as a major factor in their split - as well as his close relationship with June.

Two years after tying the knot, Johnny and June had only-son John.
