Boris Johnson's Commons comeback moved a step closer tonight after he was selected to fight a safe Tory seat at the general election.

The London mayor saw off three rivals - one of whom was born in the constituency - to win the support of party members in Uxbridge and South Ruislip.

In a blaze of publicity rarely afforded to a vote in a school hall, reporters mobbed the mop-haired mayor in the car park as odds on him becoming the next Prime Minister shortened to 6/1.

Back in the fold: Boris Johnson at Ruislip High School tonight, where he was selected to fight the safe seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip at next year's general election - despite still being London's mayor until 2016

Mini-celebrity: Unlike almost any other Tory selection in history, Mr Johnson was mobbed by reporters as he arrived in the cart park of Ruislip High School, wearing a rucksack and accompanied by his wife Marina

'I am obviously thrilled,' he said, playing down suggestions he had his eyes set on the Tory leadership - a prospect on which William Hill is offering odds of 2/1.

He added: 'It will be a tough fight, it will be a long fight. But I have no doubt whatever that we are going to be able to return David Cameron and the Conservatives with an absolute majority in 2015.

'This is Act One, Scene One of a very long process and what I have got to do now is have a lot of talks with people here in Uxbridge and South Ruislip, get to know people, get to know the association better. There's a lot of digging in to be done.'

He admitted that he had no immediate plans to relocate to the constituency.

'I live in London,' he said. 'I have got a home in London. I don't rule it out but it won't happen immediately.' 

Before the ballot, Mr Johnson and his three rivals made a behind-closed doors pitch to party members in the hall at Ruislip High School. 

Mr Johnson won outright on the first count, without the need for a second round.

Criticism: Mr Johnosn insisted he was not going back on his word by saying London was out of recession

The mayor's bid survived concerns over his determination to see out his full City Hall term despite it running until 2016, a year after he may become an MP.

Critics said he could not do both jobs at once to the best of his ability, citing a 2012 'solemn vow' in which he said leading the capital out recession 'cannot be combined with any other political capacity'. 

But he insisted he was not going back on his word - by saying London was already out of the doldrums.

Last night he insisted: 'It has been done before and I see no reason why it shouldn't be done again.

'I would point out that it is possible to be both an MP and have a very big job such as foreign secretary or prime minister at the same time.' 

The colourful politician's decision to return to Westminster has stoked speculation over his hopes to succeed David Cameron as Conservative leader.

No contest: Uxbridge and South Ruislip is only Labour's 392nd target seat and the mayor is widely expected to win - with William Hill making him the 1/50 favourite, and 2/1 to be the next leader of the Conservative party

The Prime Minister insists, however, that he would be delighted to have the mayor back in Parliament, saying he wants his 'star players on the pitch'.

Mr Johnson, a former editor of the political magazine The Spectator, previously served as MP for Henley for seven years before leaving to take up the City Hall reins in 2008.

He will defend a majority of 11,216 in the north-west London constituency held by former deputy chief whip Sir John Randall, who is stepping down. 

The others in the frame for the selection were the deputy leader of the local council David Simmonds,  deputy leader of Windsor and Maidenhead Council Simon Dudley, who was born in the constituency, and Harrow-born barrister Suella Fernandes.

Praising the quality of his opponents, he said: 'It was a very enjoyable selection process and I want also to pay tribute to the other three candidates who were here who were all very good indeed and I am sure they will go on to get good seats.' 

The seat is only Labour's 392nd target seat and the mayor is widely expected to win - with William Hill making him the 1/50 favourite.

And the bookmaker's odds on Mr Johnson becoming the next Tory leader are now 2/1.

His high profile could, however, attract a wide church of fringe candidates to compete against him.
