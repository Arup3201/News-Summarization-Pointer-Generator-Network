A cyclist has filmed a motorist swearing at him 25 times in just 35 seconds in a heated road rage row.

Eddie Bell, 38, a railway maintenance planner who shot the footage on his iPhone, claims he was almost cut-up by the driver of a Jaguar XF S worth £51,000 on a road in Eastbourne, East Sussex.

It led to a roadside confrontation in which the man let off a tirade of abuse, including f******, s***, c***, and w*****. Mr Bell reported the incident to police and has now published the video online.

Shouting: A railway maintenance planner who shot the footage on his iPhone claims he was almost cut-up by the driver (pictured) of a Jaguar XF S worth £51,000 on a road in Eastbourne, East Sussex

He hopes viewers will identify the balding, stocky motorist, whom he has labelled the ‘raging cockney’. The incident happened on Sunday at 11.05am, when he was coming to the end of a 52-mile ride.

Mr Bell - who is a British Cycling-qualified coach - claims he was sat at a red traffic light on his Trek Domane carbon road bike when the black car pulled up alongside him.

The father of four said a row developed after the motorist allegedly crept into the green box and up to the advance stop line for cyclists. Then, two miles on, he claimed the man lashed out at him.

He added: ‘I was at the advanced stop 
line for cyclists, within a green box, which is designed to keep us safe
 and give us a chance to get a head start.

Swearing: The incident happened on Sunday morning, when the cyclist was coming to the end of a 52-mile ride

‘This car pulled up alongside me in the box and got intimidatingly close. I asked him what he was doing, but he did not hear me because his window was up.

'I let him know I was filming but it did not seem to deter him - he just went mental. I’ve never heard somebody swear so much and get so enraged in my life'

‘However, his wife saw me and attracted his attention. He wound down the window, we exchanged a few words and then he darted left across my path, as if he was desperate to beat me.

‘If I had not held back he would have wiped out my front wheel and sent me tumbling. As he drove off I gave him a cheeky wave, which I think wound him up.

‘I did not make any gestures and was not 
aggressive. About two miles down the road he came past me again, having 
turned around, and was barely 6in from my elbow.

‘He continued off into the distance, parked up, got out of his car, and was standing at the side of the road waiting for me.

‘I prepared myself for a confrontation and got my phone out ready to record it because I feared for my safety. I let him know I was filming but it did not seem to deter him - he just went mental.

‘I’ve never heard somebody swear so much and get so enraged in my life. I cycled all the way home on the pavement because I thought there was a chance he would come after me.’

Mr Bell added: ‘I was absolutely 
terrified because he was a big man, and rather menacing. It left me 
shaking with fear as I rode away. I’ve shown the footage to friends who 
could not believe it.

Father-of-four Eddie Bell (pictured) - who is a British Cycling-qualified coach - said the row developed after Baldwin, who is from Kent, allegedly crept into the green box and up to the advance stop line for cyclists

‘He had a real London accent, so we’ve called him the “raging cockney”. With a huge, expensive car like that, he probably pays a lot of road tax and assumes he has more rights on the road.’

His Domane bike is worth £3,200, weighs 7.4kg and has a top speed of 30mph. The Jaguar has a 3-litre engine, top speed of 155mph and can accelerate from 0 to 60mph in 5.9 seconds.

A Sussex Police spokesman said: ‘Police can confirm they have received a report from Mr Bell.’
