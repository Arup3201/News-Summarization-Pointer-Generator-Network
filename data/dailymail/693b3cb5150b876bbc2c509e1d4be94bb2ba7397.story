Missing: A 22-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of child abduction after Erika Kacicova, 13, disappeared on Monday

A 22-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of abducting a 13-year-old girl who has been missing for five days.

Erika Kacicova, 13, was last seen on Monday at around 4pm as she left her home in Darnall, Sheffield.

A 22-year-old from Bradford handed himself into police after hearing about appeals to find Erika and is now 'assisting officers' to help find the missing teenager.

South Yorkshire Police have launched a search operation to try and find Erika and are appealing for her to get in touch to ensure she is safe and well.

Erika, who has gone missing previously, is described as being around 4ft 11ins tall, Eastern European, of slim build, with long, dark-brown, straight hair and brown eyes.

She was last seen wearing blue jeans, pink polo-style shirt and a silvery-grey coloured jacket.

Officers are carrying out door to door enquiries in her home town of Darnall and detectives are working on the information coming in from the public.

A team of South Yorkshire officers have gone to Bradford to look for her there and work with colleagues in West Yorkshire to help locate the missing teen.

Detective Inspector Helen Tate said: 'Erika has now been missing for almost 5 full days and we haven’t had any positive sightings or confirmed contact from her.

'We know she has gone missing before but not for this long.

'She is a young girl, away from home and our main aim is for her to return safe and well.

'We know Erika’s family have friends and acquaintances in the Bradford area, so she may well have travelled to West Yorkshire.

'We are grateful for the calls from the public, so please contact us if you think you know where Erika is.

'Erika, if you are reading this, please let us know you are okay. You aren’t in trouble; we just need to know you are safe.'

Anyone with information regarding Erika’s whereabouts should contact South Yorkshire Police on 101.

Last sighting: Erika was last seen leaving her home in Darnell, Sheffield, around 4pm on Monday afternoon
