An Arizona mother let the world into her operating room on Wednesday as she underwent a double mastectomy - the same operation Angelina Jolie had in February to reduce her chances of developing breast cancer.

Using Twitter, Melissa Ray's doctors in San Antonio, Texas, live tweeted each step of the preventative procedure, in a bid to shine a light on the subject for Breast Cancer Awareness month.

The mother of two small children deemed the daunting operation, where both breasts are removed, necessary given her family history of breast cancer and after testing positive to the BRCA gene.

Doctors Minas Chrysopoulo and Steven Pisano of PRMA Plastic Surgery, which 'specializes in advanced breast reconstruction after breast cancer,' teamed up for Ray's surgery.

Their every move was described on Twitter, sometimes with photographs, along with facts about the cancer-causing BRCA mutation and DIEP flap, the type of breast reconstruction Ray had chosen.

One of the first tweets showed a photograph of Ray pre-op, discussing 'her decision to have a mastectomy to reduce her risk of breast cancer by 98 per cent.' Â

She tested positive for the gene two 
years ago and traveled to Methodist Hospital for the treatment, which 
involved building new breasts using skin and fat from her abdomen rather
than using implants.

Ray's
mother tragically died of breast cancer, and she decided later 
discovered she had a very high risk of developing it herself.

Chrysopoulo said Ray researched her options and decided to 'take the bull by the horns' and undergo the preventative procedure, thinking of her kids.

The doctor applauded her for allowing her surgery to be live-tweeted.

'It was very brave of her,' he told mysanantonio.com news website, 'and can prove helpful to other women who are trying to make a decision.'

The mastectomy got underway at 9 a.m. and was over by noon. The reconstruction was completed by 5 p.m.

'She's in good condition,' hospital spokesman JoAnn King told mysanantonio.com.

While also giving the low down on preventative and reconstructive surgery, the doctors also revealed they like to rock in the operating room.

'We're listening to Muse on Pandora today in the OR. One of the physicians favorites!' they tweeted.
