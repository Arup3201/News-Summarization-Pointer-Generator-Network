The last day of a New York City dance music 
festival featuring high-profile acts including Avicii, David Guetta and 
Diplo has been canceled over drug-related health concerns.

The city says it recommended Electric Zoo festival not 
continue on Sunday after two attendees died and four others had to be 
hospitalized during the first two days of performances on Friday and 
Saturday.

The two dead have been named as Jeffrey Russ, 23, from Rochester, NY and 20-year-old Olivia Rotondo from Providence, Rhode Island.

Shutdown: Electric Zoo Electronic Music festival on Randall's Island, NYC was shut down today after suspected drug deaths

Mr Russ was taken to Harlem hospital at 3.10am on Saturday but doctors were unable to save him.

Miss Rotondo, who attended University of New Hampshire, was taken to Metropolitan Hospital on Saturday evening but died around 10pm.

The New York Daily News reported that she tweeted in the hours before her death: 'The amount of traveling I've done today is unreal. Just get me to the damn zoo.'

Four more people are being treated in intensive care units in New York hospitals, authorities said.

The city says the deaths appear to have been linked to 
illegal drugs, specifically MDMA, or ecstasy, also known as Molly. Definitive causes of death have 
not yet been determined.

The festival took place on Randall's Island in the East River, New York City. 
Event organizers were turning people away on Sunday.

Questions: The cause of death for the 20-year-old University of New Hampshire student has not been confirmed

Condolences: Festival organizers complied with the city's recommendation and closed the festival

The event's founders expressed condolences on its website to the families of those who died.

The
message read: 'The founders of Electric Zoo send our deepest 
condolences to the families of the two people who passed away this 
weekend.

'Because 
there is nothing more important to us than our patrons, we have decided 
in consultation with the New York City Parks Department that there will 
be no show today.'

The festival has been held since 2009.

The tragic deaths come after a 19-year-old college girl died on Wednesday of an apparent drugs overdose. 

Brittany
Flannigan, a 19-year-old student at Plymouth State University, was 
rushed to hospital after a show by German DJ Zedd ended about 12.30am on
Wednesday at the House of Blues in Boston.

A
man and a woman, both in their 20s, were also taken to the hospital, 
but survived.

Miss Flannigan died shortly after arriving at Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital. The New Hampshire-native was a sophomore at Plymouth State University.
