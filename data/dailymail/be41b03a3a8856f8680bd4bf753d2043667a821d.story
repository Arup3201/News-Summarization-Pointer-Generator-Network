The father of a five-year-old boy is teaching his son how to wrestle alligators as he hopes he will one day take on the family business.

T-Mike Kliebert, of Hammond, Louisiana, hopes his son Blaise will take over The Kliebert Gator Farm which is the largest and oldest in the world after his grandfather Harvey set it up in the 1930s.

He is now teaching him how to handle some of the 2,500 alligators they keep at the farm.

Mr Kliebert, who was brought up on the farm that is now owned by his father Michael and was set up by his grandfather Harvey, has also been wrestling gators since he was a child

Mr Kliebert said: 'I really hope that in the future Blaise carries on this family's heritage and culture'. Mr Kliebert is pictured, right, with an alligator at Klieberts Alligator Farm in Hammond, Louisiana

Mr Kliebert, who was brought up on the farm that is now owned by his father Michael and has also been wrestling gators since he was a child, said: 'I really hope that in the future Blaise carries on this family's heritage and culture.

'I'm sure there will be times when he changes his mind and wants to do something else but unlike most kids he has a real proud tradition that he can carry on.

'I want his sons to take over the farm one day like me and my family before me.'

Blaise's mother Sara Bordelon, 27, however, has developed different ideas, particularly after her son was bitten by one of the young reptiles.

She said: 'It's very hard for me because I didn't grow up around this.

'I have had to watch Blaise riding on gators his entire life.  

Despite being bitten on numerous occasions, Mr Kliebert considers each and every one of his 2,500 alligators to be a part of the family

The biggest gator on the farm is around 15ft in length. Mr Kliebert has been known to wrestle even bigger animals that weigh in excess of 1,000lbs. Pictured is Mr Kliebert and his son Blaise with a 12ft alligator

'He often comes home and tells me he has been bitten - not by a big one obviously, but it's still scary.'

Mr Kliebert however sees no problem in allowing his young son near the creatures.

'If he is happy doing it then I want him to do it right,' the 29-year-old said.

The family generates their income through selling the gator meat or their skin and showing visitors around the farm

'He could end up making a mistake and getting hurt if he didn't know what he was doing.

'I've shown him everything I know about the gators.'

Blaise meanwhile seems to be quite keen on the idea of following in his father's footsteps.

He said: 'When I grow up I want to be tough like my daddy and wrestle gators.'

Despite being bitten on numerous occasions, Mr Kliebert considers each and every one of his 2,500 alligators to be a part of the family.

He said: 'It's not often that family want to kill you but these alligators are naturally predators.

'They don't actually want to hurt you - they're more afraid of you than you are of them but they will hurt you when it comes down to it - you corner them and they're dangerous.'

The biggest gator on the farm is around 15ft in length. Mr Kliebert has been known to wrestle even bigger animals that weigh in excess of 1,000lbs.

He said: 'I meet a lot of people who say I am stupid for doing this job but to me it is an everyday job.

'You do get hurt from time to time but that comes with any job.

'It's what I've always known and it's my passion, I wouldn't want to do anything else.'

The family generates their income through selling the gator meat or their skin that can be used to make shoes, handbags and accessories.

They also make a large amount of cash from showing visitors around the farm.
