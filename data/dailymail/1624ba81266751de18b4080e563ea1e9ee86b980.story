West Ham will look to complete a season-long loan deal for Alex Song this weekend.

The Barcelona midfielder has been told he can leave the Nou Camp ahead of Monday’s transfer deadline, and the Hammers are in talks with the former Arsenal man about a temporary switch to Upton Park.

Manager Sam Allardyce was growing increasingly confident of landing Song on Friday after the Hammers made good progress towards a deal.

Sportsmail understands Song  is on standby to travel to London this weekend to complete his move to east London once a deal is finalised.

But following successful talks, the Hammers are hopeful of completing the signing.

Song’s arrival could spell the end of Mohamed Diame’s stay at the Hammers.

Diame is wanted by Queens Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp, and Song’s signing may see the powerful midfielder deemed surplus to requirements.
