Police forces across the country have wasted hundreds of thousands of pounds by topping up patrol cars with the wrong type of fuel.

Thirty seven constabularies have admitted that their police officers have made countless careless mistakes by filling up diesel engines with petrol and vice versa, costing the taxpayer at least £600,000 since 2009.

In reality, the figure is likely to be even higher given 15 forces in England and Wales provided incomplete information to a Freedom of Information request filed by The Independent.

Careless: Police forces have cost the taxpayer £600,000 by putting the wrong type of fuel in squad cars

To tackle the problem, Essex Police even installed 'talking fuel caps' at a cost of £4,000, which play a recorded message reminding officers what fuel was required.

But it had little affect on the oblivious officers, who pumped petrol into diesel cars no fewer than 150 times between 2008 and 2013 at a cost of £32,726 - eight times the cost of the caps themselves.

But a spokesperson said it had 'ceased to be a matter of great concern' as there had been a year-on-year decline in the number of incidents recorded.

The spokesperson added: 'Over the years the force has made concerted efforts to reduce these instances of human error.'

Oblivious: Despite warning signs and even 'talking fuel caps' officers have continued to make costly mistakes

In North Wales, bright yellow cap covers were installed in diesel cars seven years ago, but that did not stop officers causing damage costing £11,161 over four years.

Leicestershire Police was handed a bill of £2,859 for just one mistake in 2010.

And the Metropolitan Police force, which has a fleet of 6,500 vehicles, has spent £288,151 making repairs to 991 of them following errors at the pumps since 2009.

A spokesperson said: 'If a vehicle is unavailable then clearly that's not ideal, but we can work around it.'

They added there is no set punishment that is handed out to the officers who make such mistakes.

Figures from the AA suggest at least 150,000 drivers fill up their cars with the wrong type of fuel each year.

A spokesman said: 'Misfuelling seems to be associated particularly with the growth in diesel car sales.

'Modern diesels are so quiet it's easy to forget you're driving one, particularly if it's a second family car or hire car.'
