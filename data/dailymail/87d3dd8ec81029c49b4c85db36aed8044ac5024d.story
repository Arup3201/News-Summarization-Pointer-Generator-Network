Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz has defended the company's ridiculed 'Race Together' campaign as 'very genuine'.

The campaign is encouraging workers to write 'Race Together' on cups and strike up conversations about race as they serve customers their coffee. The company is also preparing a guide with questions to pose, such as: 'How have your racial views evolved from those of your parents?'

After the campaign was announced earlier this week, the coffee chain was slammed on social media and was accused of using racial tensions to boost its bottom line.

But during Starbucks' annual shareholders meeting in Seattle on Wednesday, Schultz defended the campaign and said the company is simply trying to use its massive reach for good.

'Some in the media will criticize Starbucks for having a political agenda,' he said. 'Our intentions are pure.'

Speaking on CBS This Morning on Thursday, he added: 'This is a highly charged, highly emotional issue, we understand that.

'We've tried to be very thoughtful, very genuine, very authentic and recognize that by leveraging our stores, potentially, we can elevate the conversation and make a positive difference.'

He said that he was not surprised by the backlash but that if the company's workers can 'elevate the understanding and the empathy with one customer per day', he will be satisfied. 

After the campaign was announced, Twitter ruthlessly mocked Starbucks.

One user tweeted: 'I don't have time to explain 400 years of oppression to you & still make my train.'

Support: Schultz was joined on stage at the annual meeting by rapper Common, who also spoke about the importance of engaging with people from different backgrounds in support of the campaign

Another added: '#RaceTogether is what happens when a 1%-er without any actual anti-racist education or training has a mid-life "white man's burden" crisis.'  

An executive on Starbucks' communications team, Corey duBrowa, even blocked people on Twitter before temporarily taking down his account after being bombarded with criticism over the campaign.

DuBrowa later said in a post on Medium that he felt he was being 'personally attacked in a cascade of negativity' and that he had gotten overwhelmed, but later reactivated the account. 

When Good Morning America asked Schultz about some of the scathing criticism on Thursday, Schultz responded: 'Well, you know what I say to that - no good deed goes unpunished.'

He has explained that workers do not have to participate in the campaign, and that stores can make customers another drink or cover up cups if they don't like the message. 

Ridiculed: After the campaign was announced, Twitter users slammed the idea as naive

Questions: Another Twitter user pointed out the lack of diversity in the campaign material

Inserting itself into national issues is not new territory for Starbucks Corp.

In late 2012, the chain asked workers to write 'Come together' on cups to send a message to lawmakers about stalled budget negotiations.

And in 2013, the chain placed newspaper ads saying that firearms were not welcome in its cafes after they became the site of gun rallies. But the company stopped short of an outright ban.

Schultz said at the time that Starbucks was neither for nor against guns, underscoring that even a company that wants a voice in national conversations has to be careful about alienating customers.
