Oisin Tymon (above), the producer at the centre of the Jeremy Clarkson 'fracas', fears the incident could cost him his career, sources claim

The BBC producer involved in the 'fracas' with Jeremy Clarkson is terrified he is going to lose his job, sources claimed.

Oisin Tymon has been working  on the Top Gear franchise in various roles since 2005 and was previously an assistant producer on BBC One's The One Show.

But the 36-year-old has been in hiding all week after it emerged he had been punched by the presenter at a Yorkshire hotel after a day of filming on March 4. 

One insider close to his legal team at Slater and Gordon described Tymon as 'mortified'.

'He is terrified that he might lose the job he loves and has been doing for the past six years. All he wants to do is get back to work,' they told the Sunday Mirror.

'He is mortified by the whole thing.'

The comments were made after it was revealed that the producer has become the target of online trolls and death threats.

One Twitter user @CurtisBetts wrote: 'If they don't bring @JeremyClarkson back I'll be throwing punches Oisin Tymon.'

And @KHJRobinson added: 'If Clarkson is sacked, will Oisin Tymon be the most hated man in the UK?'

Details about the incident have ranged in detail. One report claimed the 54-year-old presenter split Tymon's lip after he came back to the hotel to find only a cold meat platter was on offer for dinner.

Other sources suggested the 40-minute row was not entirely about the lack of food.

Lawyers for both parties will put their cases to an independent inquiry, which starts tomorrow.

Clarkson started the disciplinary process himself after phoning Danny Cohen, director of television at the BBC, to apologise about the row.

AA Gill, a friend of Clarkson, confirmed the presenter made the first move in the hope that it would end tension. 

'He explained he had lost his rag after a difficult and tiring day,' The Sunday Times reported him saying.

Cohen immediately suspended Clarkson and pulled the last three episodes of the popular show.

Clarkson is being represented by law firm Olswang, which refused to comment. Paul Daniels, representing Tymon, added that his client did not wish to add a statement.

The inquiry will report back to Cohen and Lord Hall, director general, who will decide on the pair's fate. It is not known how long it will take.

It has also emerged that Clarkson called BBC director of television Danny Cohen (pictured) after the row  to apologise

An inquiry will be launched tomorrow - until then it is not known what the future is for Clarkson or Tymon. The presenter has changed his Twitter biography to reflect the unknown, adding 'probbably' (sic) to his description

Lord Hall refused to 'speculate' on Clarkson's future after details of the incident emerged and said the BBC's internal investigation would 'get the people who are impacted by this together'.

He said: 'There is a lot of speculation, we have got to establish the facts and I intend to do that before we come to a final decision. 

'That is what we are about to do.' 

But BBC management sources have claimed that Top Gear would survive without Clarkson as other shows – including Have I Got News For You and Strictly Come Dancing – have coped with the loss of a much-loved presenter.

They added about Tymon: 'We would hope he will continue to be employed by the BBC after this matter is resolved.'

Meanwhile, a petition to reinstate Clarkson has gathered more than 870,000 signatures. 

This evening Clarkson jokingly made reference to the pulled show by tweeting a picture of darkness with the caption 'and tonight on Top Gear'.  

The BBC launched an astonishing attack on Jeremy Clarkson yesterday, comparing him to sex offender Jimmy Savile and urging him to check into rehab.

Blaming the now notorious 'fracas' with a Top Gear producer on 'personal issues', one of the most senior Corporation executives said Clarkson was 'self-destructing' and needed help.

Most controversially, the TV chief, who has been directly involved in the fallout from the incident, likened Clarkson's supporters – including the Prime Minister – to those who turned a blind eye to Savile's appalling crimes. 

Last night, friends of the 54-year-old presenter expressed disbelief that the BBC should make such explosive claims before its internal investigation into the controversy had even begun.

'I am in total shock that someone at the BBC would attack their own talent and deliberately smear Jeremy,' said Perry McCarthy, who was Top Gear's mysterious test driver The Stig. 

The comments came during a wide-ranging official briefing given to The Mail on Sunday by a senior BBC figure.

The executive likened 36-year-old Tymon's position to that of Savile's victims, who feared they would not be believed while he was alive.

'The pressure this guy [Tymon] is under is so Savilesque in a way,' he said, adding that Clarkson's support from high-level politicians recalled the way Savile was once defended. 

'If you look at what David Cameron says or what [former Culture and Media Secretary] Maria Miller says and you swap Clarkson for Savile, you get this: David Cameron is effectively saying that Savile's a real talent, Maria Miller saying Savile will be Savile.'

The BBC executive also said that attempts to suggest the ‘fracas’ was part of a wider battle between Clarkson and Danny Cohen, the BBC’s powerful director of television, were misleading.
