A personal trainer has kept a photo diary documenting her dramatic transformation into an award-winning bikini body.

Leanne-Grace Costa clinched fourth place in an international Ms Bikini contest - her first ever competition.

The 31-year-old, from Middlesborough, started preparations for the contest just five months ago and took photos of her body to show her progress at stages of her training.

Leanne-Grace admits that sticking to the incredibly strict eating regime is very tough 

She went up against 50 entrants from across the globe to clinch fourth place in the international competition.

Leanne-Grace said: 'It was my first competition and I thought I'm just going to go for it - and I'm not going to stop until I win.

'It's an intense regime. It makes you feel nice but also appreciated for the hard work.

'For the bikini content you can't just come in off the streets to compete. but you can't be overdeveloped either and I like the category.'

Leanne-Grace became interested in training when she met a man who used to be Mr Universe.

Month four: As well as training twice a day, the personal trainer stuck to a low fat, high-protein diet

The personal trainer she sticks religiously to a regime of eggs and oats in the morning followed by lunch of chicken salad and dinner of white fish and vegetables.

She snacks regularly on tuna and vegetables, yogurts, oats, rice cakes and protein shakes. 

She said: 'He got me really interested in it as he was an everyday guy and not show-offy at all.

'He had seen me train and saw that I could work really hard - he said "you can do this".'

In June, Leanne-Grace took on a trainer and overhauled her lifestyle with a strict diet and two hours of exercise a day.

Leanne said: 'The diet has to be part of your routine and it can take a bit of planning.

'If I'm invited for a meal for a best friend's birthday, I could go as I'm allowed one treat meal a week, however I'd need to get a menu first and have sauces on the side. It's tough.'
