Bill Clinton was once paid an astonishing $1.3 million for two days worth of speeches, an analysis of Clinton's finances published today shows.

On another occasion he hauled in $1.4 million for speeches given during a a seven-day sprint across Europe.

A comprehensive look at Clinton's post presidency pay day by The Washington Post reveals Bill really has been working 'very hard' to bring in the bacon for his family, giving 542 paid speeches since his term ended.

The Post determined that Clinton made $104.9 million off of his speeches between 2001 and early 2013.

In 2012 alone Clinton gave an impressive 72 paid speeches, bringing in $16.3 million.

'I’m shocked that people still want me to come give talks,' Clinton told Meet the Press host David Gregory in an interview this week at the fourth annual Clinton Global Initiative America meet-up in Denver.

Data for Clinton's speeches after the beginning of 2013 is unavailable.

Bill was required to file financial disclosure forms throughout his wife Hillary's tenure as a U.S. Senator and as Secretary of State, but when she left the Obama administration last year, that information became private.

If Hillary ran for president in 2016, their tax information would likely become public again, giving Americans a clearer picture of how much of a boon the speaking circuit has been on the power couple's finances.

Interest in the Clinton's wealth has piqued in the last month after Hillary told ABC's Diane Sawyer that she and Bill were 'not only dead broke, but in debt' when they departed the White House in 2001, and that is why they charge so much for individual speeches.

May 28, 2011: Achmea, $600,000

November, 12, 2011: Ericsson, $750,000

November 13, 2011: Hualua, $550,000

March 25, 2011: THISDAY, $700,000

February, 13, 2012: THISDAY, $700,000

'You know, it was not easy,' Hillary said.

'Bill has worked really hard — and 
it's been amazing to me — he's worked very hard.'

The remark has inspired a round of attacks from Republicans, including 'I Wish I Was As Broke As The Clintons' t-shirts and bumper stickers created by political action committee America Rising.

The Clintons have been coy about how much they regularly receive to make remarks, but the number was thought to be around $200,000.

WaPo's analysis of Bill's speeches indicate that it could be more.

In 2011 and 2012 Bill was paid a respective average of $248,333 and $226,736 per speech.

'There’s not a lot of negotiating room,' Chuck Carr, a vice president of the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries told the Washington Post of his organization's experience hiring Bill to speak in 2009.

'You are offered a contract and there’s very little in the contract that you can change.'

Bill's pay day has seen an increase throughout the last three years as a result of several high stakes speeches.

Swedish
 communications technology provider Ericsson paid Clinton $750,000 for a
 November 12, 2011, speech he made in Hong Kong, China, setting the 
record for most amount of money a former U.S. president has received to 
give remarks.

THISDAY
 Newspaper Group paid Clinton $700,000 for a Lagos, Nigeria speech on 
March 25, 2011. The organization paid Clinton an additional $700,000 for
 a February 13, 2012 speech.

Clinton's biggest fans have come from the financial services industry, which has paid the former president $19.6 million since 2001 to grace 102 functions with his presence.

TD Bank, an affiliate of TD Ameritrade, has paid Clinton $1.8 million for 10 speeches.

Goldman Sachs has brought Clinton in to speak eight times to the tune of $1.35 million.

The 42nd president has also been very popular abroad, collecting $56.3 million from foreign institutions, primarily in China, Japan, Canada and the United Kingdom.

Hillary Clinton is also in high demand, if not higher demand than her husband, as a speaker.

Much of the information about her speeches is private, but Mother Jones posits that Hillary has made more than $5 million off her speeches since last year.
