Christina Aguilera shocked fans today as she emerged on stage at the Michael Jackson tribute concert in a dishevelled state.

The 30-year-old singer performed at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales, today as part of the controversial show.

Her blonde hair, which was filled out with long extensions, was matted mess and her skimpy corset and fishnets did little to flatter her very curvy figure.

Bad hair day? The singer's blonde mane looked matted and unkempt

She belted out one of the King of 
Pop's favourite songs, Smile by Charlie Chaplin, with her usual flair 
but her outfit certainly hit a low note.

She later changed into a more demure 
navy dress, with military detailing favoured by Jackson, which was more 
forgiving on her frame.

The lead up to the Michael Forever 
concert plagued by controversy and largely overshadowed by the Los 
Angeles manslaughter trial of Jackson's doctor.

It was marred by fan criticism, sluggish ticket sales and dissension within the Jackson family.

The Black Eyed Peas pulled out of the lineup this week, citing 'unavoidable circumstances'.

And Jennifer Hudson all cancelled at the 11th hour, and she didn't hide her frustration at the show's organisers.

She tweeted earlier today: 'To my uk 
fans that were coming to the mj show in wales. I will no longer be 
attentding due to major production issues.

'I would have thought they would have informed you all by now , so since they did not , I am. Thank u for your support.'

Still, the show went on with a lineup
that also included Cee Lo Green, Jamie Foxx, Gladys Knight and Smokey 
Robinson, and British stars Leona Lewis, Alexandra Burke, JLS and 
Diversity.

Jackson's three children were also present for the concert.

'We're very happy to be here on this 
special night to honor our father,' said 13-year-old  Paris, who made a 
brief onstage appearance alongside brothers Prince, 14, and 9-year-old 
Michael Joseph Jr., known as Blanket.

The children wore outfits evoking 
their father's famous styles - Paris most strikingly, in a red and black
Thriller-style jacket. Blanket stood stoic and shy, but the older 
children smiled and appeared confident in the spotlight.

On a stage shaped like a giant glove,
the musicians performed songs from across Jackson's career - from his 
childhood with the Jackson 5 through monster solo albums like Thriller 
and Bad.

Participants urged fans to ignore the criticism and controversy, and to revel in the celebration of Jackson's musical legacy.

'It's not about the controversy,' 
said R&B star Ne-Yo, who kicked off the show with a rendition of 
Billie Jean, complete with some passable moonwalking.

'It's not about the trial. It's not about his death. It's about celebrating his life. It's about celebrating his music.'

The 50,000-strong crowd at Cardiff's 
Millennium Stadium did just that, roaring with approval as Jackson's 
brothers Marlon, Tito and Jackie - three-fifths of the original Jackson 5
- took the stage to perform Blame It On the Boogie with British boyband
JLS.

'Can you feel his spirit in the house
tonight?' asked Marlon. Judging by the cheers, the fedora hats and the 
sequined gloves in the audience, many could.

Jackson died in June 2009, at age 50, as he was preparing for a string of comeback concerts in London.

His last hours are being relived in 
graphic detail at the manslaughter trial of Dr. Conrad Murray, accused 
of giving Jackson a lethal dose of the anesthetic propofol and other 
sedatives in the bedroom of his rented mansion on June 25, 2009.

'This is a great counter-act to 
that,' said Motown great Smokey Robinson, who gave a soulful rendition 
of 'She's Out of My Life.' 'And it gives people something happy to do, 
rather than thinking about what's going on in the trial.'

The show mined a rich trove of 
Jackson hits. Leona Lewis crooned I'll Be There, Beyonce delivered the 
early single I Wanna Be Where You Are and Jamie Foxx performed Rock With
You.

'Tonight is a history lesson,' Foxx told the crowd. 'We're going to cover five decades of greatness.'

The concert has divided the King of 
Pop's family and followers. The three brothers, sister La Toya and vocal
group 3T - composed of three of Michael's nephews - all performed, 
while 81-year-old matriarch Katherine was in the audience.

But Michael's brothers Jermaine and 
Randy and sister Janet have stayed away, saying it is wrong to hold the 
show at the same time as Murray's trial.
