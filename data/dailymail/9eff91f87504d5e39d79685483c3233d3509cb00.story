Lines of credit: Tony Blair has taken out a £4.2million loan from JP Morgan against his central London home

Tony Blair has taken a £4.2million loan secured against his family home from the US bank he advises, it emerged yesterday.

The former Prime Minister received the seven-figure mortgage from JP Morgan, which pays him £2.5million a year for his advice.

It was unclear last night why Mr Blair needs a capital injection of £4.2million, with his office declaring it a ‘private matter’.

In the past he has taken out mortgages on his properties to help fund further investments, and sources suggest he may be looking for an overseas home to add to his portfolio.

One said yesterday: ‘It would not surprise me if Blair was hunting for a place in the sun, somewhere like the Caribbean or Tuscany.

‘He doesn’t ski, so you can rule out a chalet.’ Mr Blair’s £17million property portfolio already includes homes in central London, in the country and properties for each of his three elder children.

The latest mortgage is secured against the family home in Connaught Square, central London – purchased in 2004 for £3.65million.

Mr Blair later extended it by buying the mews house behind and the property is now worth an estimated £7.5million.

In addition, Mr Blair and his  wife Cherie own a seven-bedroom mansion in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, worth £5.75million –  where, as revealed in the Daily Mail,  they are undertaking elaborate renovations.

They have also bought three houses worth between £1.5million and £1million for their children Nicky, Euan and Kathryn.

And in 2010, there was speculation 
that Mr Blair was set to buy a £4million home on Barbados after he spent
 three consecutive summers while Prime Minister staying at Cliff 
Richard’s six-bedroom villa on the island’s exclusive west coast, though
 nothing came of it.

Mr Blair’s lucrative consultancy 
services and other work since leaving politics are thought to earn him 
around £20million a year.

Last week it emerged that the former 
Labour Party leader helped mediate a deal between mining giant Xstrata 
and commodities trader Glencore, on which JP Morgan is a key advisor – 
though Mr Blair’s involvement is said to be separate.

Yesterday his office denied 
speculation that he received the loan on ‘preferential’ terms from the 
bank for helping to mediate on the merger.

He was called in to help by Glencore chief executive Ivan Glasenberg.

Qatar, a key investor in Xstrata, insisted that Glencore raise its offer or it would veto the deal.

The Sunday Times reported that Mr 
Blair was asked by Mr Glasenberg to hold a meeting at Claridge’s, the 
five-star hotel in Mayfair, with Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Hamad 
Bin Jassim Bin Jabr Al-Thani.

It is thought the sheikh accepted the
 deal after Mr Blair secured an improved offer – although it will only 
be finalised in a few weeks’ time.

He is understood to have earned a 
£620,000 fee for easing the merger’s path, and is in addition likely to 
earn a seven-figure ‘success fee’.

He is also said to earn £1million a year advising Zurich Financial Services.

A spokesman for Mr Blair’s office 
said last night: ‘This isn’t a mystery,  it’s a non-story about 
someone’s private mortgage arrangements.

‘The mortgage has nothing at all to 
do with Mr Blair’s work for JP Morgan and any suggestion of preferential
 treatment is incorrect, untrue and quite frankly total nonsense.’
