Manchester City have released a purple third kit to be used by the Premier League champions in the cup competitions this season.

The kit has been launched by the club ahead of their opening Champions League game at Bayern Munich on Wednesday, and is officially released for fans on September 25.

A City press release said: 'We wanted to utilize vibrant colour so these kits look brighter at night against the grass and under floodlights.

'Under a dark sky these kits will look electric, as if powered by batteries, and will provide an almost electric flash of colour on the pitch.'

Nike have designed the kit to aid players on the pitch, right down to the material of the socks

A state-of-the-art product from Nike, the kit is designed to aid players on the pitch, right down to the material of the socks.

'There is less material on the sock to enhance players’ touch, while flex grooves on the ankle and top of the foot prevent bunching.'

Along with Bayern Munich, City also face CSKA Moscow and Roma in this season's Champions League group stage, hoping to go one step further than last season when they lost in the round of 16 to Barcelona.
