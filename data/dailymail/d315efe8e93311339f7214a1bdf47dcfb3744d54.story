Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's World Cup dream is on a knife-edge after his right knee buckled during England’s stormy 2-2 draw with Ecuador.

The England midfielder was substituted in the 63rd minute in a game which also saw Raheem Sterling sent off.

The Arsenal man, who was seen leaving the stadium visibly upset, crumpled in a challenge by Ecuador’s Carlos Gruezo and will undergo a scan on Thursday. Oxlade-Chamberlain’s season with his club has been disrupted by a groin injury and he had only just returned to full fitness.

Worry: Oxlade-Chamberlain was forced into an early exit against Ecuador after picking up a knee injury

Awkward: Ecuador midfielder Carlos Gruezo landed awkwardly on the knee of the midfielder

Concern: Roy Hodgson said it is too early to make a decision on what happens next with Oxlade-Chamberlain

Replacement? Michael Carrick is on the stand-by list for England

England’s stand-by players in 
Oxlade-Chamberlain’s position are Michael Carrick and his Manchester 
United team-mate Tom Cleverley. Roy Hodgson will call one of them up if 
he is out of the tournament and the England manager said: 
‘Oxlade-Chamberlain’s knee buckled as the player turned into him.’

On selecting a replacement, Hodgson added: ‘When I have to cross that bridge, I’ll do that. At the moment I don’t know the extent of the injury. My hope is that Oxlade-Chamberlain will not be seriously injured. He did ever so well and looked really sharp. It would be an enormous blow if we were to lose him, so I’d prefer to concentrate on the satisfaction and positivity I can take from the game.’

Jack Wilshere and Luke Shaw were both subbed with cramp, but should be fit to face Honduras at the same stadium on Saturday.

England will be without Sterling, suspended for one game after he was sent off for a 79th-minute challenge on Manchester United winger Antonio Valencia, who retaliated and was also red-carded.

Hodgson felt Valencia over-reacted, 
adding: ‘I’m disappointed. I thought it was a fierce challenge from 
young Raheem, not a foul challenge. He played the ball and accelerated 
into the ball. I’m disappointed with Antonio’s reaction, grabbing the 
player. Had he not jumped up there wouldn’t have been a problem but when
 he does that, the referee had to deal with that and sent Raheem off. 
Jack Wilshere did not react from a very similar challenge.’

Valencia, who suffered a horrific knee injury three seasons ago, said: ‘I’m sorry for the fight with Sterling. England are the best team we’ve played so far.’ Hodgson was surprisingly reluctant to praise Everton midfielder Ross Barkley’s lively display. ‘I’m not prepared to address your obsession with Ross Barkley — he lost the ball an awful lot of times as well,’ he said when pressed over the player whose fine run set up Rickie Lambert’s goal.

Wayne Rooney was the other scorer.

England team sponsor Vauxhall apologised to the FA after breaching security by tweeting team-sheets which revealed the players’ passport numbers.

Official FIFA team-sheets always have the numbers alongside the players’ names, along with their date of birth, but sensitive passport information is not for publication.

‘The tweet was deleted from our account within a minute,’ said Vauxhall. But by then it had been retweeted hundreds of times.
