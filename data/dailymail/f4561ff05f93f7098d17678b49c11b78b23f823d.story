A Michigan soccer player who killed a referee with a single punch to the neck pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter Friday and is now facing up to 15 years in prison.

Bassel Saad, 36, acknowledged in a Detroit courtroom that he struck John Bieniewicz during a game last summer at a Livonia park.

Bieniewicz, a married father of two, died two days later. Saad initially was charged with second-degree murder and had been scheduled to stand trial beginning Monday.

The auto mechanic from Dearborn will be sentenced March 13. Under the plea deal, he could be sentenced from eight to 15 years in prison. He would have faced up to life in prison if convicted of murder.

Saad, a native of Lebanon, has lived in the US legally for 15 years but is not a citizen. The father of three now could also face deportation.

‘This was something less than an attempt to kill. ... Mr. Saad, he got up that day, and he determined that he was going to play soccer. He didn't determine that he was going to kill someone on that particular day,’ said defense lawyer Cyril Hall, who added his client is ‘very, very remorseful.’

Kris Bieniewicz, the referee's wife, attended Friday's hearing, but did not speak to reporters afterward.

The mother of two, who coaches basketball at a local middle school, told The Associated Press earlier this week that she hoped Saad ‘never sees the light of day.’

‘But is that realistic? No. I know it's not realistic. But at the same point in time, I think my husband's life is worth more than eight years,’ the widow said.

Bieniewicz, a medical assistant at a children's hospital whose wife described him as ‘just an easygoing guy,’ was killed while refereeing an over-30 men's league match at Mies Park.

A number of players testified in court last year that Saad had been issued a yellow card, or an official warning, following a foul in the first half of the June 29 game, and Bieniewicz was about to issue him a second yellow and eject him from the game for being verbally abusive.

That's when the referee was struck, the players said. Saad’s punch landed in the head and neck area, causing the referee to fall and stop breathing.

The medical examiner determined the cause of death to be blunt impact to the left side of the man's neck and ruled the killing a homicide. Bieniewicz, 44, left behind his wife and two young sons.

Kris Bieniewicz recently testified at Michigan's Capitol in support of proposed legislation that would make it a felony to assault a sports official in the state.

Referees ‘are out there on an island with no one to defend them. Something more than a misdemeanor should be in place,’ she said.

A soccer referee who was fatally punched by a player during a recreational game in suburban Detroit did not expect the attack, one of the player's teammates testified on Wednesday.

Dr. Jamal Saleh testified during a probable-cause hearing in July that Bieniewicz did not see the punch coming.

Two players from the opposing team also testified that Saad knocked Bieniewicz to the turf with one punch after the referee indicated he planned to give Saad a red card and eject him from the game. 

Saleh said he rushed toward Bieniewicz, who was on his back grasping a yellow card in one hand and a red card in the other.

In soccer, a yellow card is held aloft by the referee to caution a player following a foul or other misconduct. A red card is shown by the referee when a player is being thrown out of the game. Two yellow cards given in the same game equal a red card.

In this case, the players testified that Saad had been issued a yellow card following a foul in the first half, and Bieniewicz was giving him a second yellow for being verbally abusive. That's when he was struck, the three players said.

A skirmish erupted between players following the attack. Saleh said he quickly checked on Bieniewicz and the referee initially was not breathing but had a pulse.

Saleh said he performed CPR and told the unconscious Bieniewicz: 'Wake up, buddy. You're going to be OK.'

Player Scott Herkes testified that Saad removed his jersey and left the field with another man as Bieniewicz was being tended to.

Herkes said he followed the men into the parking lot and took down the license plate number of the vehicle in which they left.

Prosecutors showed a photograph in which Saad appeared to be making an obscene gesture while seated in the vehicle.

In 2005, Saad was involved in another assault on a soccer field. Court documents obtained by Detroit Free Press indicate that the auto mechanic repeatedly struck another player in the head.

He pleaded not contest in that case and was sentenced to five days' community service and 12 months' probation.
