A busy roundabout was splatted with cheese and baked bean pasties after a lorry dropped the snacks across the road. 

As well as the pasties, the lorry also spilt some of the cinnamon rolls it was carrying. 

Pictures taken at the scene show a police car blocking off the roundabout, near the village of Balderton at 4.30am this morning.

A busy roundabout in Nottinghamshire was splatted with pasties and cinnamon rolls when a lorry dropped the snacks this morning

Nottinghamshire Police had to close a busy roundabout after a lorry spilt its cargo of cheese and baked bean pasties all over the carriageway 

Pasties and rolls, in blue trays, were heaped on to the pavement as police officers helped the Highways Agency clear the snacks off the road. 

The lorry did not crash and it is believed the snacks fell from their storage spot on the top of the vehicle.

The incident was then the source of some amusement on Twitter with @NottsSpecials - the account for Special Constables in Nottinghamshire Police - tweeting: 'Bit cheesy but someone spilt the beans, yes cheese and baked bean pasties over the A1 - we sorted it, yeast we could do.

'It was a bit of a roll around initially but kneaded to clear due to traffic build up. The pressure was on :-)'

The spillage was the source of some amusement on Twitter, with the Special Constables in Nottinghamshire Police tweeting that the clean-up was the 'yeast we could do' 

People on Twitter shared a joke with the Special Constables in Nottinghamshire Police, who had helped clean up a roundabout near the village of Balderton after a lorry dropped cheese and baked bean pasties on the road

Greggs, the largest bakery chain in the UK, also tweeted the force after the unusual incident this morning at 4.30am in Nottinghamshire

Others then joined in the conservation, including bakery chain Greggs, who tweeted: '*shocked face* hope everyone was ok!'

A spokesman for Nottinghamshire Police confirmed officers were called to the scene at 4.30am.

He said: 'A lorry shed its load which led to baked goods going over the highway.' 

The incident follows a similar one in June this year, when a huge spillage of mash potato brought the A64 near Malton, a major road in North Yorkshire to a standstill. 

The lorry dropped just over a quarter of its contents on the carriageway, which resulted in thousands of drivers being stuck in huge traffic jams.
