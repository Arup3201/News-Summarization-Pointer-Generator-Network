As Wayne Rooney prepares to pull on an England shirt for the 100th time, Sportsmail writers provide their memories of the striker from his time representing the Three Lions...

JEFF POWELL

The first day of March, 2006, was unusually wintry, even for Liverpool. England were playing Uruguay in a friendly at Anfield. There was a dusting of snow during the match, followed by a heavy fall as it ended in a 2-1 victory for England.

The snow was several inches deep as I trudged through the Shankly Gates, head down against the storm. Suddenly, splat. A snowball hit me in the chest. I looked up to see young Wayne Rooney, laughing.

Then he said: 'Hello, Mr Powell. Come on. Help me deal with these lads.'

He was engaged in a snowball fight. A friendly one, even though this was Anfield, the kids were Liverpool fans and he was a former Everton player who had become a superstar with Manchester United.

I joined in, shoulder to shoulder with Wayne, until both of us and the group of boys were smothered in snow. There was more laughter as the lads shouted their thanks and scurried off through the dim yellow light cast by the old lamp posts.

As I picked up my briefcase, Rooney asked: ‘Where you heading?’

‘Driving back to London.’

‘Where you parked?’

‘Up there in a side street.’

‘I’ll walk with you. Can’t be too safe this time of night.’

And so he did, as we chuckled about the snowballs.

It hadn’t been his best of nights in an England shirt. He had been substituted in the 64th minute, before Peter Crouch and Joe Cole scored the goals which won the game.

Still he took time out to delight that group of fans and josh with me. Still he was one of the lads. Still is at heart.

As he says, if he hadn’t made it as a footballer he would be out there with them on cold nights. Behind the goal rather than shooting into it.

Those who would knock England’s best player might think on that as he collects his 100th cap at Wembley this Saturday. Raise a glass, even. Cheers Wayne. Thanks for the memory.

It is sad I’ve never felt more excited about Rooney than watching him on his first competitive start for England against Turkey at the Stadium of Light in 2003. 

He was mesmerising. The World Cup semi-finalists couldn’t get near him. And he was 17. 

You left feeling as though the last piece of the jigsaw had been completed in the puzzle of the golden generation.

MATT BARLOW 

Opportunities to understand Rooney have been rare, and interviews brief, usually lit up by a flash of meaning in his blue-eyed stare rather than his words. 

After a brilliant qualifying campaign for the World Cup in 2010 he went to South Africa with Fabio Capello comparing him to Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo and yet his public communications of note amounted to an abusive rant at a TV camera after the bore draw with Algeria. 

He has begun to reveal a little more since he became captain, but the fondest memories have been his flashes of brilliance on the pitch, in particular the goal against Poland last year. 

He was wearing a protective headguard after clashing with Phil Jones in training — it had come off and he headed the ball in anyway.

On the pitch? At Euro 2004, he was dazzling. 

Off it? At the 2006 World Cup, Coleen was the most charming of the WAGs; always very polite.

I was sitting on the bike in the gym at a hotel in Baden-Baden at the 2006 World Cup when Rooney’s then-girlfriend Coleen walked in. 

Noticing that a few people on the exercise machines had run out of water she went over to the dispenser and brought several cups back for those working out.

CHARLES SALE 

The build-up to the 2006 World Cup was dominated by a stand-off between Rooney and England following a metatarsal injury. 

When he returned to Baden-Baden after being cleared to play, he commented: ‘The big man is back in town.’

Wayne seemed happiest training with England the day before a game; always joking and laughing. 

But when it comes to football, he’s always committed. He’s undoubtedly the hardest tackler in training. Some of his challenges take your breath away!
