Vertigo actress Kim Novak has launched a bizarre attack on hit film The Artist claiming its use of the distinctive and haunting music from Hitchcock's movie amounted to 'rape'.

Novak, 78, who shot to fame after appearing in the 1958 classic, took a full page ad in entertainment magazine Variety last week to declare: 'I want to report a rape.'

She added: 'I FEEL AS IF MY BODY... OR, AT LEAST MY BODY OF WORK - HAS BEEN VIOLATED BY THE MOVIE THE ARTIST.'

Music from Vertigo is used in the French black-and-white homage to the silent-film era.

She went on: 'It is morally wrong for 
the artistry of our industry to use and abuse famous pieces of work to 
gain attention and applause for other than what they were intended.'

However, her choice of language was 
cricitised by Lynn Blanco, CEO of the Rape Crisis Center in San Antonio,
Texas, who argued that the comparison to rape was extreme.

Ms Blanco, who is a victim of rape 
herself, told FoxNews.com: 'When rape is used in a way that 
overdramatizes a situation that did not include an actual rape it 
diminishes the suffering of the thousands of men, women and children who
have suffered from the crime.'

Novak's language was seen as horribly extreme and over-the-top by advocates against sexual assault.

Lynn Blanco, CEO of the Rape Crisis Center in San Antonio, Texas,
and a rape victim herself, told FoxNews.com: 'When rape is used 
in a way that overdramatizes a situation that did not include an actual 
rape it diminishes the suffering of the thousands of men, women and 
children who have suffered from the crime.'

The ad, which appeared in Variety magazine this week, came at the same time as a statement by the actress.

In it, the 78-year-old said she felt violated because music from the Alfred Hitchcock classic is used in the French black-and-white homage to the silent-film era.

Music man: Bernard Herrmann wrote the score for Vertigo, as well as the Orson Welles' classic Citizen Kane

Novak said The Artist filmmakers had no reason 'to depend on Bernard Herrmann's score from 'Vertigo' to provide more drama' for the movie.

'This film took the love theme music from Vertigo and used the emotions it engenders as its own. Alfred Hitchcock and Jimmy Stewart can't speak for themselves, but I can.'

Hitchcock, who also directed horror 
classics like Psycho and The Birds, died in 1980. Stewart, most famous 
for his role in Christmas classic It's a Wonderful Life, passed away in 
1997.

Novak added: 'It was our work that unconsciously or consciously evoked the memories and feelings to the audience that were used for the climax of The Artist.'

Novak, who played the dual role of both a suicidal trophy wife of a rich San Franciscan and a morose working girl opposite Stewart in the Hitchcock thriller, said that even though Herrmann was given 'a small credit at the end,' she believed 'this kind of filmmaking trick to be cheating.'

'The Artist,' which was written and directed by Michel Hazanavicius and stars Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo as silent film actors, leads Sunday's Golden Globes ceremony with six nominations and is expected to be a front-runner at this year's Academy Awards.

The wordless film combines a mostly original jazzy score, sound effects and old-fashioned title cards which display dialogue.

Opposing statement: In a response to Novak's campaign, The Artist's writer/director/editor Michel Hazanavicius said he respects Kim Novak greatly, and 'is sorry to hear she disagrees'

In a statement, Hazanavicius said: 'The Artist was made as a love letter to cinema, and grew out of my [and all of my cast and crew's] admiration and respect for movies throughout history.'

'It was inspired by the work of Hitchcock, [Fritz] Lang, [John] Ford, [Ernst] Lubitsch, [F.W.] Murnau and [Billy] Wilder.'

He added: 'I love Bernard Herrmann and his music has been used in many different films and I'm very pleased to have it in mine. I respect Kim Novak greatly, and I'm sorry to hear she disagrees.'

Novak, who last appeared in the film Liebstraum in 1991, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010.
