Safety fears: A Bob Martin Cat Flea Collar with Dimpylate have been taken off the shelves

Flea collars for pets are being withdrawn from sale after The Mail on Sunday revealed fears that they could poison children.

Leading manufacturer Bob Martin is taking the action voluntarily after dog and cat owners began calling the company demanding to know the risks.

It follows our report last week about a French decision to ban pet collars containing diazinon, which was originally developed as a Second World War nerve gas.

French scientists are studying three cases in which children may have absorbed diazinon, also known as Dimpylate, through their skin after repeatedly cuddling or sleeping with pets.

Diazinon poisoning symptoms include headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, muscle-twitching, personality changes and loss of co-ordination.

In extreme cases, it can lead to convulsions, coma and even death – although there is no evidence that flea collars could provide sufficient exposure to cause this.

Last night, Dogs Trust veterinary director Paula Boyden said: ‘We very much welcome Bob Martin’s move to withdraw these collars from the  market as a precautionary measure.

‘Many dog owners will not have been aware of the possible health hazards of using a product containing diazinon and we commend The Mail on Sunday for raising awareness of this issue.

‘There are safer, equally effective treatments and we see no reason why other manufacturers shouldn’t follow Bob Martin’s example.’

Despite the concerns about the collars in France, Britain’s regulator, the Veterinary Medicines Directorate, has refused to impose a similar ban.

It is awaiting a full report from the French and the results of a separate inquiry by European Commission vets and medical experts.

However, British veterinary sources believe the move by Bob Martin will increase pressure on other manufacturers.

Concern: French experts say children are particularly at risk from collars that contain Dimpylate

A spokeswoman for the company said it had ‘received calls from consumers wanting clarification on the potential risk’.

She added: ‘Bob Martin is unaware of any adverse reactions in people and all product packaging clearly states that owners should not sleep with pets that are wearing a flea collar.

‘However, the concern of pet owners is paramount and we have therefore decided to voluntarily remove these products from our range.

‘There are a wide range of safe and effective flea treatments available and we will be working with retailers in the coming weeks to provide alternative products.’

A spokeswoman for rival manufacturer Johnson’s, which uses diazinon in dog and cat collars, said: ‘We are not planning to take any action until we have received advice from the regulatory authorities.’

Industry sources say several hundred thousand of the controversial collars are sold in the UK each year.

France’s veterinary medicines watchdog has published a blacklist of 51  collars that contain diazinon. Others containing similar toxic chemicals such as propoxur and tetrachlorvinphos have also been withdrawn.

The decision is being examined by the European Medicines Agency.

The European Commission said it would consider more detailed information from France before reviewing the sale of flea collars in other countries.
