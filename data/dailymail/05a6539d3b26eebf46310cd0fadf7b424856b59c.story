With the BBC recruiting Phil Neville to replace Alan Hansen, football punditry is set for a major change this season - but perhaps not as much as NBC suggest in their newest Premier League advert.

Fictional American coach Ted Lasso, who starred in last season's video as Tottenham's new manager, is back in the studio, and still completely out of his depth in the hilarious clip.

In the video Lasso, played by Jason Sudeikis, has returned from his disastrous managerial career in North London to work for NBC on their Premier League coverage.

On the gantry: Lasso, after his spell at Spurs, begins the advert in the commentary box with NBC's Arlo White

In the studio: Sudiekis' character also appears in a studio where he admits he doesn't understand relegation

Step down: The coach attempts to bring his Premier League experience to a girl's football team

The coach fails to understand relegation, ruins a live broadcast, and has to resort to coaching a girls team as he seeks to adapt to life back in the states.

Sudeikis' character also drinks with a group of Arsenal fans whilst wearing a Tottenham shirt and talks about how much he misses England. 

But the highlight of the six-minute clip is undoubtedly a meeting with Tim Howard, to whom Lasso complains 'I think I literally think I have a better understanding of who killed Kennedy than I do of offside'. 

Fitting in: Coach Lasso is often seen in a Tottenham shirt - even when surrounded by Arsenal fans

Guest star: The advert also features a cameo from Tim Howard, who starred for the USA at the World Cup
