John Holden: The Director of Systems Policy has received a 50 per cent pay increase

Senior NHS managers have shared more than £300,000 in pay rises as a result of the Government’s reorganisation of the Health Service, despite remaining in apparently identical posts.

Department of Health directors whose jobs were moved to the NHS England quango have enjoyed startling rises, official figures suggest.

Other regional directors of public health, now employed by Public Health England, another quango, have also had huge rises.

Labour said the increases, revealed by ministers in a series of Parliamentary answers, were incredible, especially because doctors and nurses have had to accept real-terms pay cuts.

NHS England, the new quango responsible for running the Health Service, has taken on large numbers of senior staff previously employed by the Department of Health, while Public Health England is now in charge of health protection.

The figures given to Parliament show that John Holden, the director of system regulation at the Department of Health, received an extra £40,000, a 50 per cent pay rise, as the director of systems policy at NHS England.

Ben Dyson, director of commissioning policy and primary care at the department, had a £30,000 rise even though his title at NHS England stayed exactly the same.

Richard Murray, a financial director, also received a £35,000 rise after moving to NHS England and Miles Ayling, director of innovation, saw his pay rise by £30,000 when he moved to the same quango.

Jo-Anne Wass, former chief of staff at the department, is to be paid up to £300,000 over two years after leaving her NHS England job.

Miss Wass, 46, had a rise of around £15,000 when she was made ‘national director of HR’ at the quango. She is a close ally of NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson, the ‘man with no shame’, who has retired following controversy over the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal over patient mortality.

Miss Wass is understood to have arranged an unpaid consultancy role at Leeds University before Sir David’s departure. NHS England has said it will continue to pay her salary for up to two years because she was ‘on secondment’, even though she will not return.

Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham said: ‘The scandalous waste caused by David Cameron’s NHS re-organisation gets worse the more we find out about it. Nurses and midwives, who have been told that they will not receive even a 1 per cent pay increase this year, will find these revelations utterly galling.

‘It seems people at the top have done very nicely out of Mr Cameron’s re-organisation but those at the bottom are told there’s no money left. No wonder NHS staff morale has hit rock bottom under this Government.’

The figures were revealed following the Department of Health’s admission last month that 3,950 NHS managers had received redundancy payments – 330 being given more than £200,000 – during last year’s re-organisation, only to return to work in the new bodies.

Labour MP John Spellar said it was ‘outrageous’ that ‘the fat cats at the top are getting monstrous payouts and then being re-employed straightaway elsewhere in the NHS’.

Health minister Dr Dan Poulter told the Commons: ‘The redundancy terms were negotiated when Andy Burnham was a minister for the Department of Health … Unfortunately, because of the terms set by the previous government, some managers are still treated better than patients.’

An NHS England spokesman said: ‘Over a year ago, a small number of people won promotion to new roles in NHS England. There are 20,500 fewer administration roles in the NHS than four years ago.’

Duncan Selbie, chief executive of Public Health England, said: ‘The salaries were not enhanced on joining PHE and were approved by the Cabinet Office. The current salaries incorporate NHS national Clinical Excellence Awards.’

A Department of Health spokesman said all the staff involved had come off the Whitehall payroll and on to the books of the quangos.
