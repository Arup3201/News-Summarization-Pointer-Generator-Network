Lionel Messi will lead his Argentina side into the World Cup final tonight unaware that he and nearly every other international star at the tournament is at the centre of a multimillion-pound conflict over the future of football.

The battle could mean the 2014 competition in Brazil is the last time FIFA can put on a finals with access to global football idols such as Messi, Neymar, Alexis Sanchez and Thomas Muller.

Football’s world governing body and top European clubs, represented by the European Club Association, ECA, have shared an uneasy peace through a contract known as a Memorandum of Understanding, MoU, agreed in January 2008, which controls the release of players to international matches.

Worry: Blatter and FIFA need to agree a new deal to keep the best players at the World Cup

But The Mail on Sunday can reveal that the document expires at the end of this month and there is nothing to replace it.

A senior source from the ECA, who along with UEFA are signatories to the MoU, said: ‘Without the MoU the clubs won’t feel bound to release players to [international] teams from outside of Europe.

‘The MoU is the recognition of a basic principle — the fact that players are club employees. The clubs release them for the commercial purposes of the FAs belonging to FIFA.

‘But there is also a consequence for the clubs: the acceptance of FIFA rules on the release of players. The MoU expires at the end of July. So what about when Argentina, Brazil and Cameroon call up players for friendlies or qualifiers then?’

Top European clubs have provided more than 75 per cent of the players at this tournament. But they see August 1 as their opportunity to pull the plug on all involvement in any international football run by FIFA, putting at risk the very existence of Sepp Blatter’s organisation.

FIFA have shrugged off repeated scandals over the years but the clubs’ ultimatum could finally be what destroys them from within; with no World Cup, FIFA would effectively have no income to keep them going.

There have been signs of the impending implosion for years. In 2011 Bayern Munich’s president, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, who is also ECA chairman, said: ‘I don’t accept any longer that we [should be] guided by people who are not serious and clean. Now is the moment to intervene. Because knowing something is wrong is an obligation to change.

‘I’m not optimistic because they believe the system is working perfectly as it is. It’s a money machine, World Cup after World Cup. And for them, that’s more important than serious and clean governance.’

The effects of the ECA’s threat could be felt by FIFA’s subsidiary confederations within weeks. Qualifiers for continental tournaments in the Americas, Oceania, Africa and Asia are due to begin in September but clubs will feel within their rights to withhold their players from taking part.

Stars like Muller, Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo will still be able to play for Germany, England and Portugal because separate agreements are in place for European nations through UEFA.

But guaranteeing player participation at Euro 2016 has cost UEFA £120million — more than double the £41m FIFA agreed to pay for the tournament in Brazil. Yet clubs see the £727m sitting in FIFA’s bank account as having been generated on the sweat of the stars whose wages they pay. ‘It is £120m for Euro 2016 from UEFA and £41m for 2014,’ said the senior ECA insider. ‘That is a huge difference.

‘There are no numbers at all on the table from FIFA [for the future]. We have made assumptions from our side that there should be at least an equal amount if not more from the Euros.’

There is a history of brinkmanship in football politics and there remains the chance clubs will be bought off by FIFA in the short term, just as they have been in the past. But this time, the ECA’s stance raises questions about whether FIFA can afford to balance the clubs’ interests with those of their own member associations.

After announcing a profit of £42m at its Congress last month, FIFA’s president Sepp Blatter distributed ‘extraordinary success premiums’ between the national FAs and continental confederations worth £39m, meaning little was left over.

At the same time FIFA promised to double that figure next year — when Blatter stands for re-election as president. Yet he could face revolt from within his own organisation if he overpromises to the ECA. ‘They can’t give more money to the clubs than they do today to the national associations and the confederations,’ the source said. ‘So they have to give more money to them than to us. This is a very difficult one for FIFA.’

Indeed, despite the apparent willingness to talk terms with FIFA, even if a deal can be agreed for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, it would only be a temporary truce.

All the signs are that a longer-term deal covering the 2022 World Cup in Qatar would be out of the question. The clubs are holding out on making space in the schedule even for qualifying for that tournament.

‘We have an international calendar up to 2018,’ added the source. ‘There has to be a separate discussion on the World Cup calendar for 2022. That’s due for September and November and the ECA is a stakeholder in those discussions. But there has to be a new MoU for those talks with FIFA on the calendar to take place.’

The world governing body is said to have ignored requests from the clubs to talk about the impending split since 2012. The source claims FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke and Blatter have concentrated on other issues.

The source said: ‘This matter has been on Valcke’s table for about two years. We approached FIFA and spoke about an increase for 2014 and 2018 — they said 2014 was not touchable because they had budgets in place. This is very important for FIFA but they seemed to think it was more important to finalise 2014. Time is on our side. They’ll be the ones without protections.’

Another senior source at the separate European Professional Football Leagues body, EPFL, which represents 29 different domestic competition organisers across Europe and their member clubs, corroborated these claims.‘These clubs are those who employ and pay the players,’ said the EPFL source. ‘They’re the big clubs who will always be competing in Europe. The clubs could say, “let’s create something else”. They wouldn’t do UEFA or FIFA competitions. Why even have UEFA?’

FIFA said: ‘FIFA remains, as always, willing to discuss with the ECA on these topics, as it does with all other stakeholders in the world football community.’
