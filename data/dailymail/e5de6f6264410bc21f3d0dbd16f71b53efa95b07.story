Former Cabinet Minister Andrew Mitchell is facing a large tax bill after investing in a children’s film based on the comic-strip cat Garfield, it emerged last night.

The ex-Government chief whip has been identified as an investor in a film-financing company which has been declared a tax avoidance scheme by the authorities.  

People who invested in the scheme are to receive ‘accelerated payment notices’, ordering them to settle up. Among them is Mr Mitchell who put money into a film called Garfield: A Tale Of Two Kitties. The 2006 ‘semi-comedic romp’ was  savaged by critics.

Other movies which benefited from his cash included X-Men: The Last Stand, according to BBC2’s Newsnight programme.

Last night it was unclear how much money Mr Mitchell, who resigned from Government over the notorious ‘Plebgate’ incident, will be told to pay. But the debt could not come at a worse time for the Tory MP, who is involved in two potentially expensive libel actions.

The politician is suing The Sun newspaper over its original report about his row with a diplomatic protection officer called Toby Rowland, whom he allegedly called a ‘****ing pleb’ at the gates of Downing Street. Mr Mitchell denies he used the word ‘pleb’. PC Rowland is, in turn, suing Mr Mitchell over comments he made about him at a televised press conference last year.

However there is mounting speculation that Mr Rowland’s legal proceedings against Mr Mitchell could be dropped, following negotiations involving the Association of Chief Police Officers.

Mr Mitchell’s case against The Sun remains scheduled for the High Court in December.

According to Newsnight, Mr Mitchell – a former investment banker whose wealth was  estimated to be £2.2million in 2012 – invested in Ingenious Film Partners 2 in the 2000s.

According to its promoters, it was a vehicle that encouraged people to invest in British film. But according to HMRC, it was created to generate inappropriate amounts of tax relief for its investors.

This week, HMRC listed Ingenious Film Partners 2 as one of 1,200 candidates for ‘accelerated payment notices’. This is a power that takes effect this week meaning that investors can be asked to repay all tax that HMRC thinks they should have paid before going to court.

Other well-known figures who invested in Ingenious Film Partners 2 include William (now Lord) Waldegrave, the former chief secretary to the Treasury, and Michael Grade, former chairman of the BBC. All insist they invested in the scheme to support the film industry.

Ingenious said: ‘HMRC has failed to distinguish between commercial businesses and tax avoidance schemes and have, without proper consideration, deemed all film arrangements to be tax schemes.’

As a minimum, investors in Ingenious Film Partners 2 could put in £36,000. If they put in that much, Ingenious would then loan them a further £64,000 to invest, taking their stake up to £100,000. That would be used to buy shares in film productions which, in their first year, created a £90,000 loss.

According to Newsnight, top-rate taxpayers who invested in the scheme could choose to write off that loss against their taxes. This meant that in return for putting in £36,000 in cash, they would get about the same amount in tax relief very fast – and end up owning a £100,000 stake in a group of films.

If it is challenged and HMRC wins a subsequent case, the Revenue can keep the money. If it loses, it must refund the cost of the process.

Mr Mitchell said: ‘When the last Labour Government introduced tax incentives to invest in the British film industry, along with many other investors, I did so through Ingenious Films. I resigned from Ingenious when I was in Government and always pay all tax when due.’

Lord Grade said: ‘The Labour Government at the time promoted a policy to stimulate investment in the British film industry through tax incentives. The Ingenious Fund gave effect to this policy.’

Lord Waldegrave said: ‘It was presented as a genuine film investment partnership. It never occurred to me it was tax avoidance.

‘If the revenue contact me, then I would pay it back.'
