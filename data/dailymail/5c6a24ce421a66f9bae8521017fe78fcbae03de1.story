New footage has emerged of a Michigan doctor who vanished three weeks ago after receiving a suspicious call.

Dr Teleka Patrick, 30, who started her residency at Borgess Medical Center in Kalamazoo, Michigan this year, is seen on the YouTube video saying: 'Hi baby, just to tell you about my day' and also, 'Hi baby, goodnight, it's Teleka'.

In the clip, uploaded on November 10, she then shows off a meal she has made for someone special and sings the Diana Ross song, When You Tell Me That You Love Me.

Dr Patrick, who got her PhD this spring, adds: 'We both have orange juice, and the flowers from last time.'

Dr Teleka Patrick, 30, who started her residency at Borgess Medical Center in Kalamazoo, Michigan last year, disappeared in early December

The young doctor, who was reported missing when she didn't show up for work on December 6, also shows off a meal she has made in the video

The young doctor was reported missing when she did not show up for work on December 6.

Surveillance footage showed her the night before failing to secure a room at a Radisson hotel just five minutes away from her apartment.

According to police, Dr Patrick worked a shift at Borgess on December 5 and had one of her colleagues drive her to the Radisson after work.

Both her purse and cellphone were found left behind at work, and surveillance footage at the hotel shows her trying to get a room with cash, but not having enough money.

In the footage, without 
audio, Dr Patrick talks calmly with the front desk clerk for about 15 
minutes before leaving after not getting the room.

She
 is then seen boarding a complimentary hotel shuttle back to her gold 
Lexus parked at the medical center - the last time anyone saw her.

'It
 was really sad to watch it because this is the last video record of her
 before she went missing,' Teleka's sister Tenesha Patrick told WWMT.

Just two hours later, Dr Patrick's 
car was discovered abandoned in a ditch on the westbound side of 1-94, 
more than 100 miles away in Portage, Indiana.

The keys were missing from
 the inside of the car.

Dr Patrick was officially reported missing the next day when she failed to show up for work.

One of her colleagues told investigators that she received a phone call that day and that her demeanor changed after she hung up.

Dr Patrick's parents, who live in Florida, said she has a busy schedule but usually calls them once a week, usually on Sundays.

They did not believe that their daughter was in a romantic relationship.

Her mother Irene told CNN: 'She has an outgoing personality... she's a warm, friendly, lovely person to be around.'

She added that her daughter had just bought a plane ticket to fly to Florida.

Why was she there? Dr Patrick's family doesn't know why she was trying to book a room. Investigators later found she left both her phone and purse at work

No cards: Dr Patrick was caught on the hotel's surveillance cameras trying and failing to secure the room with cash

'Who was calling her, what was that about, does that have anything to do with her disappearance?' her sister asked.Â 

Her
 family is currently offering a $10,000 reward for information on her 
disappearance, and have hired their own private investigator.

'We keep getting closer to Christmas, and it keeps getting further and further away,' Tenesha told ABC News.

Anyone with information on Dr Patrick's disappearance are being asked to call the Indiana State Police at 219-696-6242 or the Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Department at 269-383-8748.

Leaving: The last time Dr Patrick is caught on surveillance cameras, she is seen boarding a complimentary hotel shuttle which took her back to the medical center where her car was parked

Dr Patrick had started her first year of residency in Kalamazoo after graduating from medical school last spring
