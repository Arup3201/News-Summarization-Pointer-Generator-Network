Wade Lange is the Brisbane-based rag-trader who has taken on the biggest clothing manufacturers in a David and Goliath battle ... and won, claiming the much sought-after licence to produce garments bearing the Marvel Comics Superheroes.

With a specific focus, at the moment, on women's wear - Mr Lange and his team of 15, including girlfriend Kelly, have already developed a wide range of the hugely popular Captain America wear and Guardians of the Galaxy garments. 

They have just started on the other super hero themes, including Spiderman, which will be officially launched on Tuesday.

If the demand to fit out female devotees of the Marvel comics stable has been significant, Mr Lange is expected to be over-run once the men's clothing is on the rack.

He revealed to Daily Mail Australia that 'our designers are already looking at what we can do in the area of stretch-wear for the blokes, so yes that is already on the cards'.

Other favourites to be feature including Ironman, Thor, Hulk and the Avengers.

'Business has quadrupled.' 

The Captain America range from Living Dead Clothing is now compete. They have produced several Guardians of the Galxy items and will officially launch Spiderman on Tuesday

The brains behind the little battler's win. Wade Lange says he's been run off his feet ever since he started making the Marvel based clothing. The women's wear has been a huge success but the men's clothing will increase demand

The pitch to Marvel pitted him against some of the biggest names in clothing, keen to get their hands on the lucrative contract with Disney. He is convinced it was dedication that got them over the line.

'I haven't had a day off for many months now and we are determined to be successful,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'His dedication certainly rubs off on all of us,' added Living Dead Clothing PR boss Taryn Watt. 

It's the quintessential local boy made good story.

'I started doing it (making leggings) on a bit of a whim, I already had a 9-to-5 job, so it was just a bit of extra work in my garage,' he said.

Things began to move very quickly, within months the small side business had begun to grow and then the Disney deal was on the table.

The team of two quickly grew to a staff of 15 inside a large all-encompassing warehouse.

'We've gone from working in a small garage to a million dollar company,' he admitted.

''We've secured this exclusive contract for the Marvel characters in stretch-wear and moved into new premises - we are all 100 per cent dedicated to be successful, like him and we work hard for it,' said Ms Watt.

'We stood out from the others because we could show we really cared about our customers and they are very loyal to us.'

But the best is yet to come.

While they have ­released an extensive Captain America range, including leggings, bodysuits, swimwear, skater dresses and skirts and rain makers, for the ladies - it's what is in store for the blokes which has them super excited.

'Marvel, as we all know, brings with it such a massive cult following - some guys have been reading the comics since they were five years old, they will be a must-have item.' 

And everything is developed and produced in-house.

'We do not bring anything in from overseas, not one thing,' Ms Watt added.

'It's 100 per cent Australian, from the ideas, to the designing, printing, packing and shipping, we do it all,' Ms Watt added.

Living Dead Enterprises has begun producing Captain America garments for women, from bodysuits to leggings and bikinis too. The small Brisbane based company beat some of the world's biggest names to snare the licence from Disney's Marvel range

Living Dead Clothing also describes itself as: 'The creation of a small team of like minded people who wanted to create a vision through a brand whereby girls could access the highest quality products.'

They boast about being a company 'without the excessive price tag and without the rules (and) 100% Made In Australia'.

'Every girl deserves to be treated like a princess. Every girl deserves a happily-ever-after,' they state in typical story-book style.

And following the success with the female styles, Living Dead will be living it up with the release of its Marvel-themed menswear.
