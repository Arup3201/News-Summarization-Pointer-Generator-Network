It might surprise those people who associate Mark Warner holidays solely with families that about 40 per cent of the company's business comes from singles, groups of friends, and couples.

And now the firm is expanding its adult-friendly Club Mark Warner weeks, of which there are two or three each year, by adding more events and excursions at its newly refurbished five-star Levante Resort on the Greek island of Rhodes.

Such is the popularity of Club Mark Warner holidays among those who have heard of them that the check-in queue at Heathrow and our flight to Rhodes were full of cries from passengers who recognised people from previous Club weeks. It made for a very friendly atmosphere right from the start.

There were about 80 people ranging in age from their 20s to 50s on the Rhodes week, half of whom were returning visitors.

The Levante Resort, around 30 minutes by bus from Rhodes Town, is built solely for Mark Warner, and features lots of bright white tiles and a large lobby where people cluster to use the hotel wi-fi.

The rooms are situated both in the main building and in other wings built alongside the five swimming pools that stretch out to the beach. 

Going solo? No poblem. Mark Warner holidays is expanding its adult-friendly Club Mark Warner weeks, of which there are two or three each year

Rooms range from standard twins and doubles to suites, some of which have a private garden and plunge pool.

There are also three restaurants and four bars dotted around the site.

As the Club weeks all take place during school term time, the only children there were of pre-school age, but the differing timetables of those with and without youngsters in tow meant that the paths of the two groups rarely crossed.

The energetic young entertainments co-ordinator, who looked like a cross between Jamie Oliver and Prince Harry, made sure everyone knew what was happening and when.

During the week there was a quiz, a disco night, Spanish dancing, a trip to a local water park, a meal out, and various post-dinner trips to bars in the town of Kolymbia, which is just a ten-minute walk away.

Guests could join in or simply do their own thing as they wished.

As usual with Mark Warner holidays, people are lured by activities such as sailing, tennis, mountain-biking, windsurfing, waterskiing and scuba-diving.

The social tennis hour, held each evening between 5pm and 6pm, was particularly popular, with the free Pimm's luring spectators and players alike.

At the other end of the resort, the sailing enthusiasts spent the week honing their skills on a variety of crafts from dinghies to catamarans.

One of the main draws for the Club week is the chance for singletons to go away on your own and yet not feel alone.

Mark Warner caters for single travellers very well, with pre-dinner cocktails every night and allocated group tables where you can sit anywhere and talk to anyone without feeling you're crashing in on someone else's holiday.

Judging by some of the unofficial awards handed out after the official sporting ones on the final night – such as for most romantic new couple – there were a lot more than just new friendships being made. 

And indeed Mark Warner boasts that several Club holiday romances have later turned into marriages.

'We met on our windsurfing lesson' isn't a bad line to be able to use at your wedding.
