As one of the most famous Playboy models of all time, Kendra Wilkinson's body has been pored over by men for the last decade in minute detail. 

A quick search for her on Google throws up images of the blonde in more lingerie sets than most women will own in a lifetime - and she's only 29. 

But after giving birth to her second child last year, Kendra has undergone a drastic identity overhaul and now sees herself as a mother first, with sexy model ending up somewhere around No.100 on her list of priorities.

She might have escaped the I'm A Celebrity camp by this point, but Kendra Wilkinson was still taking style tips from the jungle when she attended the LA premiere of Paddington in January!

We love the black and white snakeskin print on her all-in-one, which is by Parker. It's the very same style that we have already spotted on Paris Hilton, plus the cropped leg and V-neck shape makes it super flattering. The former Playboy bunny styled her jumpsuit with a pair of ankle strap heels, making the look perfect for a daytime red carpet event.

Thanks to designer labels like Stella McCartney, Roberto Cavalli and Ermanno Scervino, python is catching up to leopard as our print of choice. Kendra's jumpsuit might be a bit on the pricey side, but it's a whole outfit in one and is ideal if you want to give your little black dress the night off.

Look to our edit below for some similarly slinky styles. Haute Hippie and Tamara Mellon have got our top picks.

She said: 'All men want to see is a body that pleases their eyes, especially in my case because I come from the Playboy world and and they don't want to see my body doing something other than pleasing them. 

'My body used to be to please men, but my body is for me now and it is to please me, now I feel like I have 100 per cent control over who I am.'

She continued: 'If guys don't like my body now that's actually a good thing, that means I'm shedding the Playboy image. 

'When I see guys saying oh you're fat, I'm like "yes! I'm glad I don't turn you on any more because I don't want to do that any more!"'

The reality star, who last year came sixth on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here, is now so far removed from her old glamour girl persona that she is planning on having her breast implants removed. 

She said: 'I'm going through a phase right now where I don't fit my boobs anymore - I'm thinking about a reduction because that was a phase and now I am out of it. 

'After my daughter was born, when I was breastfeeding it became hard not to look at my boobs now and see them as milk and fat.  

'The person I feel like today isn't a person with big boobs - I feel like I'm trapped in this body right now.'

But while she may be having second thoughts about her chest, the star reveals she has never been happier with her figure since becoming a mother. 

She said: 'Before having my kids I was a free spirit. I had no filters and I could run around naked and feel free as I felt like I had no flaws. 

'But then again, there were only certain jeans I could fit into because I was a size zero (UK size 4), while at the Playboy Mansion - I had no butt and no hips. 

'After two kids, I have hips, a butt and curves. 

'I actually love my body even more now because I remember being that thin and wishing I could fit into high-waisted jeans and sophisticated dresses but they just looked frumpy on me.'

According to Kendra, her husband Hank Baskett, who she married at the Playboy Mansion in June 2009 is equally impressed by his wife's new curves.

She said: 'I think he sees my confidence over everything and that's what he loves the most. 

'He loves my body, I have some wear and tear right now with my stomach but he talks to me about it all of the time. 

'He says if we don't have sex one day it feels like a beautiful Ferrari that's in the garage that he can't drive every day.'

But while she is now more confident than ever with her body, Kendra didn't feel this way until recently. 

During her first pregnancy with Hank Baskett IV, the star admits that she piled on the weight because she took the phrase 'eating for two' literally, like many women. 

She said: 'Because I was so skinny beforehand, I just ate and ate, then did no exercise. 

'I put on 65lbs in my first pregnancy and it took me so long to get rid of it. 

'I tried for about a year and nothing was working.'

What made it worse was that, like many women, Kendra started to compare her progress with celebrities in magazines. 

She said: 'Kourtney Kardashian was pregnant with her first child at the same time that I was pregnant with mine - we gave birth about two days apart. 

'The afterwards, her weight just dropped off. 

'I saw a picture of her looking all tiny and I just burst into tears. 

'I was thinking to myself, "I'm going to the gym twice a day, I'm getting these special meals delivered to my house, why can't I look like that?" 

'We do this to ourselves as women, but we shouldn't - it takes some a lot longer than others to lose the weight.' 

Before she became pregnant a second time, with her daughter Alijah Mary Baskett, who was born last May, Kendra was diagnosed with hypothyroidism. 

After meeting with an endocrinologist, she overhauled her lifestyle, focusing on exercise and healthy eating.

She said: 'In my second pregnancy, I was so much more active and ate really healthy food - my cravings the second time around were oranges and mangoes. 

'It made such a huge difference, because even though I put on about 55lbs, which is around 10lbs less than last time, I knew that it was good fat that was coming from a healthy place. 

'Then straight after I gave birth, about 20lbs just melted away. I was walking around the neighbourhood just three days later and I felt great, even though I'd just had a C-section.

'I still had another 20lbs or so to lose, but I didn't rush myself and it came off a lot easier than the last time.

'Although when I went in the jungle for I'm A Celebrity, that was brilliant, the last bit just came straight off!' 

This point she is keen to stress - that she gave herself time to lose the weight.

Like most other women, she too looks at some of the celebrities who show off six-packs just a few weeks after giving birth and is flabbergasted. 

She said: 'That's the time that your body should be recovering, when you should be spending time with your baby and letting yourself heal. 

'It's such a taboo.

'You can see how it happens though, because the camera adds weight, so people who are on TV think that they need to lose weight so they will look slimmer on camera. 

'Then they end up looking to skinny in photos. 

'But I have to be realistic with myself. 

'For me, I take my own selfies and see how I look through that, because I try not to go off the scale, just by how the way I fit in clothes and the way I look in selfies.'
