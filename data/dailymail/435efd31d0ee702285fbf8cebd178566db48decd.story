Rapper friends who live in the building told TMZ today that, without warning, Mr Johnson cut his penis off and jumped from the second floor.

The incident happened so quickly, that by the time friends made it to the ground floor, Mr Johnson was on his feet and 'running around screaming', the site reported.

No hard drugs were reportedly involved but the rapper is believed to have mental health issues.

Johnson is a rapper who goes by the name Christ Bearer in the group Northstar. The act wasÂ  discovered by Wu-Tang producer and rapper RZA in 1998. He produced their 2004 debut album RZA Presents Northstar.

An LAPD spokesman told MailOnline on Wednesday that an individual was taken by ambulance to a local area hospital following an incident shortly before 1am this morning at the 4500 block of Colfax Avenue in North Hollywood.

The LAPD would not confirm the individual's identity or injuries to MailOnline.
