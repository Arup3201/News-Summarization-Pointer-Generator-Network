Comedy legend Bill Kerr, one of Tony Hancock's radio sidekicks in the 1950s, has died aged 92.

Born in Cape Town in 1922 (on the same day as Judy Garland), Kerr was raised in Australia and made his first appearance on stage when he was still in his mother's arms.

He joked: 'I was such a hit, I retired in 1922 and made a comeback at seven.' He became so successful he was nicknamed 'the Jackie Coogan of Australian vaudeville'. In 1933, he made his first film, Harmony Row, where he was billed as 'Willie' Kerr.

In 1947, Kerr moved to England and from November 2, 1954 began appearing opposite Tony Hancock (who he called 'Tubs'), Sid James and Moira Lister in the iconic radio series Hancock's Half Hour. Writer Alan Simpson also appeared uncredited but could not be considered a main character.

Hancock's Half Hour, written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, began on radio in 1954. In rehearsals: (left to right): Tony Hancock, Moira Lister, Bill Kerr and Sid James

Kerr played Hancock's lodger and stayed with the show for all six series as the cast were joined by Kenneth Williams, Andrée Melly and from series four for 16 episodes Hattie Jacques as Griselda Pugh, Hancock's secretary. 

Besides Hancock's Half Hour,  he performed with such comedy greats as Spike Milligan and Peter Sellers (who both guest-starred in the show).

When the show transferred to television, Kerr did not go with it. He did appear in the first series of Citizen James, a vehicle for Sid James. 

Kerr also appeared in The Dam Busters, Doctor Who and the 1960s TV soap about a woman's magazine Compact. 

In 1979, Kerr went home and reinvented himself as a character actor and had a key role in the 1981 First World War epic Gallipoli and 1982's The Year of Living Dangerously. He appeared on the Australian stage during the 1980s, in musicals such as My Fair Lady, where he received excellent reviews as Alfred Doolittle.

In addition to his serious roles, he also continued to appear in comedies including the film The Coca-Cola Kid (1985) and Let's Get Skase (2001).

On January 26, 2011, Kerr received the 2011 Walk of Honour in Wagga Wagga, which was unveiled on May 17, 2011.

His son Wilton said that he died while watching the sitcom Seinfeld on TV at his home in Perth, Western Australia.

'He said he wasn't feeling too well quite recently and he was just quietly watching television in his room.

'Mum ... said she could hear him laughing to Seinfeld, and that was one of his favourite shows.'
