Police and immigration officials moved in yesterday to clear a ‘shanty town’ built by migrants in  a leafy London suburb.

A total of 68 mainly Romanian squatters were found living in huts built from waste wood and plastic amid the filth of a tip at a former football ground.

Just five of those at the camp, which was featured in the Daily Mail earlier this month, were found to have the right to work in the UK.

Last month dozens of Romanian immigrants were evicted from their camp on the former site of Hendon Football Club in North London

Some 68 mainly Romanian squatters were living in the huts made of plastic and waste wood amid filth

Only five were found to have the right to work in the UK and the rest were offered flights back to Romania at a cost of £50 per ticket to the taxpayer

The Romanians had been living in shacks made out of discarded planks of wood and scrap metal

The rest were offered flights back to Romania at a cost of £50 per ticket to the taxpayer. Only 19 took up the offer.

The rest were told they would have to 
leave the country within 30 days, but were released on to the street to 
live rough or in shelters, meaning it could cost up to £15,000 for 
police to find each of them, monitor them and eventually remove them.

Migrants have been living at the 
vermin-infested former Hendon FC ground for more than two years despite 
it having no running water, electricity or sanitation.

They scavenged in
 the rubbish for clothes to wear or things they could sell.

Barnet Council sold the site to 
developers for housing last year but legal challenges over the freehold 
had held up the clearance of the site.

The deal was finally completed 
on Monday.

Barnet Council said 19 of the 68 Romanians took up the offer of free flights home

The immigrants were said to have been living at the site for several months before Wednesday's raid

The Roma travellers were given papers ordering them to leave the site, which had 'danger' notices on display

Home Office officials and police raided the site at 5am yesterday before the squatters left to find work for the day.

They were supported by a helicopter to
 track any squatters who tried to escape, staff from the Romanian 
embassy and workers for a homelessness charity.

Paul Wylie, a Home Office official, 
said his department had been working with the police and the council on 
the site ‘for some time’.

‘Local residents had concerns, it had featured
 in the Daily Mail and police believe there might be links to robberies 
in the area,’ he said.

‘We have found 68 Romanians. Most are 
immigration offenders with no right to work and cannot prove they have a
 way of supporting themselves. Two tried to walk away but we had the 
support of the police helicopter so we were able to get to them.’

Most of the illegal immigrants found at the site were men, who were living in filthy conditions, officials said

The site, which is just yards from people's homes, will now be cleared for development after a legal battle

Squalid conditions: The site was illegally occupied while a legal battle went on over its sale to a developer

Police officers picked through mountains of rubbish as they ensured every person had left the site

The derelict site is strewn with rubbish after being occupied on and off three times since 2009

By midday yesterady, around 20 of the immigrants had agreed to take a free flight home to Romania

A Home Office spokesman said the 
released squatters ‘are known to us and we will be looking to question 
them again in the future, even in the next few days’.

But he was unable 
to say how they would be found, given that none had a home address. He 
said immigration staff would ‘work with the police to track them’.

Resident Gus Bodur, 49, was involved with Hendon FC and witnessed the raid.

‘I’m pleased the site is being cleared
 but residents are angry it has taken so long to sort out and we are 
upset that it will be the local taxpayer picking up the bill,’ he said.

The site was being secured  yesterday 
and the owner of the land is expected to provide 24-hour security to 
ensure the squatters do not return.

Early start: Police officers and Border Agency officials were at the derelict football club site at 5am

The site is soon to be bought by its long-term leaseholder, property development firm Montclare

As it was: Hendon Football Club vacated the site on Claremont Road in Cricklewood in 2009
