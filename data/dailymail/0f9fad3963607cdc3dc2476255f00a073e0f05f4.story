A debt-ridden hospital trust has spent £50,000 on a promotional film, to the anger of patients.

Campaigners claim people would learn more from an episode of Casualty than from the six-minute video. They also say the money would have been better spent on operations at a time when funds are short.

Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which is £7million in debt and trying to make savings of more than £30million, commissioned the film in an attempt to win back public confidence following a damning report by inspectors.

Debt-ridden Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has been criticised for spending £50,000 on a promotional film at a time when the trust is a£7million in the red and trying to make savings of more than £30million

Campaigners claim people would learn more from an episode of Casualty than from the six-minute Every Minute of Every Day video. They claim the money would have been better off spent on operations at a time when funds are short

The Every Minute Of Every Day video, posted online, was designed to convince patients and relatives that staff care.

Wexham Park, in Slough, Berkshire, spent £48,943 for the film to be made by a private company, a Freedom of Information request revealed. This does not include the time of staff who took part.

The video has been viewed 8,500 times since it was posted on YouTube in November, days before the leaking of an email from the Trust’s chief executive Philippa Slinger saying she felt patients were scared to attend the hospital and GPs were worried about referring them because of negative publicity surrounding alleged blunders.

Wexham Park was accused of failing to protect the safety and welfare of patients following an unannounced inspection by the Care Quality Commission in October.

The CQC said wards were short-staffed
 and patients’ dignity was not always respected. It also said that 
record-keeping was poor and staff complained of bullying by managers. It
 threatened to fine the hospital if standards remained low.

The film shows clips of patients 
arriving in A&E, receiving difficult diagnoses or hearing bad news, 
all to a backing of piano music.

A
 message reads: ‘Patient care is not just about the condition; it is 
about caring for patients and their families, every minute of every 
day.’

The hospital commissioned the film in an attempt to win back public confidence following a damning report by inspectors

The Wexham Park Hospital in Slough, Berkshire paid a private firm £48,943 to create  the film, a Freedom of Information request revealed

Last night Roger Goss, of Patient Concern, said: ‘It is ghastly. The only benefit I can see, is that it would be fun for the people who made it to make it.

‘Otherwise, it wouldn’t tell you anything you couldn’t get from watching Casualty or Holby City.

‘You don’t need to promote the hospital because there is no choice. It isn’t like Tesco competing with Waitrose, you are not trying to pinch other people’s business, patients have to go there. That is what makes it ludicrous.’

Miss Slinger said: ‘We made the film to help our staff reconnect to the values we all believe in and to encourage people to join us and help us improve.’
