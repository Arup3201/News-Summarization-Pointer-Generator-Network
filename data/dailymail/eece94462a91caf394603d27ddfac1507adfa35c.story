She is the voluptuous swimwear model who has become a household name overnight. 

The Sports Illustrated girl dismissed by Victoria's Secret last year as having 'the kind of face anyone can go out and buy', she went on to land a coveted cover for Vogue Italia just months later.

And now Kate Upton is embracing her curves once more as the new face (and killer body) of Accessorize's Spring/Summer collection.

The 20-year-old can be seen doing what she does best: posing in an array of dazzling bikinis for the accessory chain's latest campaign.

Sunny climes: Shot in Barbados, the new campaign sees Kate posing in an array of the brand's new swimwear

Kate makes a summery splash as she poses in the crystal clear oceans of Barbados in the brand's tie-dye bikini and matching accessories.

The Michigan-born model, who was this week revealed to be the cover girl for the 2013 Sports Illustrated magazine for the second year running, shows off her flawless tan in a strapless pink and orange bikini and vibrant necklaces.

Shot by iconic fashion photographer, Josh Olins, Kate follows in the footsteps of former Accessorize supermodels Claudia Schiffer, Lily Cole and Bar Rafaeli.

Styled by Wonderland Magazine’s Senior Fashion Editor, Julia Sarr-Jamois, the shoot fuses simple vintage glamour with sun-drenched beach styling and Kate makes the perfect beach babe.

She certainly delivers the perfect retrospective look with flits of Bardot and flirty Monroe-isms for the season’s biggest trend, Monochrome.

Speaking about her shoot and her 
favourite ways to accessorise, the model said: 'There are no rules! If 
your outfit allows it, then more is more. I always love rings, and 
Accessorize has the best rings for everyday wear.'

Her figure is envied by women worldwide, but Kate says it is all down to making time to exercise, no matter how busy she can be.

'My
schedule can be pretty gruelling, but I always make time for fitness 
and relaxing. I get facials regularly when I’m in NYC, and my trainer 
helps me to plan work outs when I’m traveling.

'A lot of sleep and water is important too, especially when adjusting to time changes,' she said.

Kate's
career is one to be reckoned with; successfully making the transition 
from of-the-moment pin-up girl to curvy cover star and captivating 
campaign icon.

Famed for her ample cleavage, she has been the talk of town lately and sees her star continue to rise.

She was watched by millions in
a Super Bowl ad for Mercedes alongside Usher and Willem Dafoe and it 
seems she was a hit after the German car giant revealed that their 
profile has been boosted with younger buyers thanks to the busty blonde.

As if she wasn't busy enough, Kate's second Sports Illustrated 
cover was officially unveiled on Monday - enlarged into a huge Billboard on 
the front of the David Letterman studios in New York.

It's her third appearance in a 
Swimsuit issue. She was first chosen as rookie of the year in 2011, when
Irina Shayk was on the cover.

Sultry: Miss Upton also starred in a sultry print and video ad campaign for footwear designer Sam Edelman whereby she posed in figure-hugging all-black lingerie and strappy high heels

This
year for the first time, the fashion shoot covers the entire world, 
with 17 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit models journeying to all seven 
continents. Photo sites include African dunes and Asian cliffs.

Kate got the surreal and beautiful landscape of Antarctica where the cover 
shot displays her clad only in a white, fur-lined parka and bikini 
bottom.

Miss Upton also 
starred in a sultry print and video ad campaign for footwear designer 
Sam Edelman whereby she posed in figure-hugging all-black lingerie and 
strappy high heels.

Speaking
about his choice, Edelman said: 'I actually had the idea of using Kate 
more than six months ago. I had a vision that Kate was going to be big.

'We shot the campaign last fall and today Kate is the hottest model in the world.'

'Kate epitomizes the classic American Beauty and yet she's approachable. And I love that she's curvy. I also love that she and I share the same passion for horses.'

She has also appeared on the covers of American and Italian Vogue.

'I love fashion, so it’s a lot of fun to be on set and to learn about the new styles and trends.

'Even though I get these amazing fashion opportunities, I am a Florida girl at heart and still love a bathing suit shoot,' she said.

The SS13 Accesorize campaign launches in stores and in print in March 2013.
