Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick is set to be out for a month after suffering a muscle injury.

The 33-year-old, who has filled in at centre-half for the club, is the latest victim in a season that has been ravaged by injury.

United manager Louis van Gaal revealed the news on Friday as his side prepared for a home clash with Leicester City on Saturday.

Michael Carrick has been ruled out of action for a month with a muscle rupture

The Dutchman described the injury as a 'muscle rupture' and said that the England international could be out for around four weeks.

Van Gaal added that there was better news surrounding winger Ashley Young.

The former Aston Villa man has revelled in Van Gaal's 3-5-2 system and has been missed since tearing a hamstring in the New Year's Day draw with Stoke City.

But the manager said he is now nearing full fitness, but would not be ready in time for the visit of Nigel Pearson's bottom-of-the-table Foxes.

Van Gaal will be hoping United can end a run of two goals in the last three matches.

But he says opponents are making it hard for his expensively assembled side.

'We have to play against teams who make the space very narrow, defending with 10 people behind the ball then it is always difficult,' he explained.

Carrick's injury is just one of dozens of injuries the Manchester club have had this season

'We have to play more quickly with high ball speed and disorganise the opponent. We have to improve our ball speed.'

Van Gaal refused to blame his misfiring frontline for the problem.

'You have criticised our defence, now we have one of the best defences in the Premier League,' he said.

'Now you are talking about the attack and we are still a force in the attack. I’ve said before it’s not the defence, it’s the team organisation. The strikers have a big part in it but it is not only them.'

Van Gaal added that he hoped his side would learn from the previous encounter with Leicester when United let a 3-1 lead turn into a 5-3 humbling.

'We don’t control the match even when we are three against one,' he said. 'That is happening always in football. That is also the beauty of football but as a top club you have to control a match and when you are in a good result like 3 or 2-1 you have to finish the match.'
