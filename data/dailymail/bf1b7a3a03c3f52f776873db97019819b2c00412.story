A visit to any costume store this fall will reveal the huge volume of sexy Halloween costumes for women on offer. But for those who prefer not to expose so much skin, there is little alternative.

Now feminist writer Suzanne Scoggins is addressing the growing issue with her website TakeBackHalloween.org.

Bursting with ideas for female costumes that don't put sex appeal front and center, the site seems to be filling a much-needed gap in the market.

Inspiring women: The costume inspiration website Takebackhalloween.org offers a link to headwear (left) that would form part of a costume based on aviator Amelia Earhart (right)

'You go into a party store and the only astronaut costume is in the male
sections in large sizes,' Ms Scoggins
told Today.com.

Taking back Halloween: Suzanne Scoggins' site provides an alternative to the usual sexy costumes on offer

'If a girl wants to be Sally Ride, the message 
is she can’t. If there‘s a girl costume, it’s an orange tube dress that 
looks like a Hooters waitress. . . or a sexy policewoman or sexy firefighter.
It makes me feel like we’re back in the 60’s. The message we’re giving 
our daughters and sons is incredible. . . Sexy 
costumes for women went from being an option to a requirement.'

Ms Scoggins, who runs her site with a team of volunteers, is well-placed to offer guidance in costume design. She trained as a historian before turning to theater where she worked as both an actor and in costume design.

She says the idea for the site was born because her friends couldn’t find anything appropriate to wear for trick or treating in with their
kids.

'Even college girls feel under pressure to be sexy,' she said. 'They didn’t 
feel free to wear regular costumes and step outside that very narrow 
uniform. I don’t have a problem with sexy, I just want a full range of 
options.'

Take Back Halloween offers DIY guides and stockist links for ensembles based on inspiring women that readers can create at home, avoiding suggestions that require a needle and thread.

Many of the ideas take a lead from 
legends, royalty and old Hollywood. Users can browse posts on Amelia 
Earhart, Frida Kahlo, Jezebel and Mae West.

A last minute section even features a post on bedsheet costume ideas.

Alongside each post is a brief history lesson on the character so that the wearer is well-informed when a fellow party-goer asks, 'Who are you?' - but they are so informative that she says some educators turn to the site in history lesson plans.

Ms Scoggins says that the site needs funding to meed demand from its millions of users, and there is currently a campaign running on Kickstarter to raise money for much-needed technological upgrades.
