Independent coffee shops in Washington are biting back against the monolithic power of Starbucks by releasing a 'disloyalty card' that encourages people to seek their caffeine fix elsewhere.

Purchasers of a a 'DC Disloyal' card are encouraged to visit all six participating shops as part of a 'coffee adventure'.

At each outlet they receive a stamp with their coffee - similar to the coffee giant's loyalty cards - and once the card is completed, their rejection of blind routine will earn them a free beverage at the shop they liked the most.

Brewing up discontent: Washington independent coffee stores have launched a 'disloyalty card' that encourages coffee drinkers to travel to one of six independent stores

'The card is a fun way to get baristas and customers talking with each other,' Dawn Shanks, a Peregrine Espresso barista who devised the program with coworker Christy Pelton, told the Washington Post.

The pair worked with five other locally-owned coffee shops and drew inspiration from similar programmes in Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Atlanta.

'It also reflects the connection all the individual shops have with one another - the coffee community is a supportive and close-knit group,' Shanks added.

So far 500 of the cards have been printed, with a second printing planned soon.

'DC Disloyal' is not the first time independent coffee shops have challenged the Starbucks supremacy. In December, a Dallas cafe started accepting Starbucks gift cards to raise awareness.

Last month Starbucks released a limited-edition rose gold gift card for $450. So keen were the followers of the multinational corporation to get one they sold out in only six seconds.

Some shoppers snapped them up and immediately sold them on eBay for thousands of dollars to desperate Starbucks disciples.
