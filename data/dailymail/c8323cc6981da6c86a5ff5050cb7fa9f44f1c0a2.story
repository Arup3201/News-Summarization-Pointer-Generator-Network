Natalie Wright was five when she was diagnosed with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), a rare condition which means she has already had to have both knees and hips replaced at just 27

A young woman suffers from a rare condition which means she has already had to have both knees and hips replaced at just 27.

Natalie Wright was five when she was diagnosed with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA),

She believes it was triggered by a simple viral infection she suffered in her first year at school.

She recalls being sent home, but 24
hours later she couldn’t move any part of her body and didn't return to school for 18 months.

She said: 'It just came on completely randomly and when I tried to move, I just screamed in pain.

Ms Wright has already had one of her shoulders replaced and both knees and hips rebuilt with metal and plastic joints after her natural bones were worn down by the disease.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a childhood form of arthritis, a condition which affects just 15,000 children and young people in the UK.

It can begin at any age including babies and toddlers, up until the age of 16

There is currently no cure but for some people with JIA, the arthritis can be very mild and the symptoms disappear after a few years. Others need to be treated for the rest of their lives.

Ms Wright, from Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, was diagnosed with JIA using a blood test and X-rays.

She was confined to a wheelchair due to the pain the condition caused her, while the correct dosage of IV steroids and immunoglobins were configured to help her control her mobility and pain.

She said: 'I spent most of my childhood years trying to get on track and lead a semi-normal life.

'There have been times when I have been able to walk unaided or on crutches but other times I was bedridden.

'I couldn’t be very active but I had a normal school life and it was just the PE lessons that I missed.'

Ms Wright in hospital aged six. She believes her condition was triggered by a viral infection which left her unable to move

Seven years ago, at the age of 20, she had her first replacement - her hip. She said: 'Every time I tried to stand up my hip locked.

'I couldn’t straighten up and it became extremely painful. I couldn’t even walk from my bedroom to the kitchen.'

Then just a week after graduating as a trained occupational therapist a year later, in 2007, her other hip required surgery.

She was also forced to have one
of her shoulders replaced in 2011, after the muscle weakness became so 
poor and she had daily pain.

'I
would have to be really bad to have the other one done,' she said. 
'It’s still agony now and the rehabilitation was the worst of all my 
joints.'

'Ms Wright added: 'I had both of my knees done as well, as they were equally as bad and required surgery at the same time, in early 2013.

'I did everything I could to avoid knee replacements including having my cartilage shaved and being given steroid injections.'

For each replacement, surgeons have to dislocate the original joint before cutting away the damaged ball and inserting the new joint.

For each replacement, surgeons have to dislocate the original joint before cutting away the damaged ball and inserting the new joint. They then hammer into the bone, before cementing it in, and for patients with high-density joints, the necessary force they use can cause fractures

Despite all the surgery, her condition persists. 'Everything has to be planned and I still have to rest a lot.  I’m not able to go shopping with my friends either as just a train journey makes me tired.

'I’m very susceptible to contracting infections due to my treatments and picking up bugs so I have to be extremely careful about picking things up.

Despite all the surgery, Ms Wright (pictured with partner John) still suffers from poor health. She said: 'Everything has to be planned and I still have to rest a lot. I¿m not able to go shopping with my friends either as just a train journey makes me tired'

'There are things my immune system would not deal very well with and it’s risky. This impacts upon my social life a lot.

'My partner John is really good. When we got together I was in a healthy stage, but just weeks later I was in hospital and couldn’t do my hair or walk properly.'

There is no cure for her condition, despite research continually being carried out.

She added: 'I basically just have to wait and see and see what the scientists can come up with. The main aim of the treatment they can give me is to improve quality of life and reduce joint damage.'

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a chronic form of arthritis that affects children under 16. Idiopathic means that there is no known cause. 

In the UK, between 10,000 and 15,000 children are affected by juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

The
most common symptoms for all types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis are
swollen, painful and stiff joints that are usually worse in the 
morning. The joint areas may look red and feel hot to touch.

The
exact cause of juvenile idiopathic arthritis isn’t known, but it’s 
thought to be an autoimmune disorder - which means that the immune 
system attacks the body instead of defending the body against infection 
and other harmful substances.
