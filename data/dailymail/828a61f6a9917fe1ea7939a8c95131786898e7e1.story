Hillary Clinton used her iPad as well as a BlackBerry handset while she was secretary of state, despite claims she used her own private email server so she would only have to carry one electronic device. 

Mrs Clinton, who is a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, is expected to announce her latest run for the White House next month. 

However, the State Department has released four emails to the Associated Press which appear to show Mrs Clinton mixing personal and professional emails as well as sending correspondence from her iPad.

Mrs Clinton has faced criticism over her decision to use her own personal 'clintonmail' email address which was run from a server housed at her New York home. 

Critics claim that Mrs Clinton used the personal email account so her correspondence could not be subject to the same scrutiny as someone using an authorised government account subject to the Freedom of Information Act.

On one occasion, Mrs Clinton's adviser Huma Abedin at the State Department emailed the secretary of state an AP story concerning a drone strike in Pakistan. 

Mrs Clinton replied with questions about interior home decorations and later apologised for the mistake. She also asked Ms Abedin whether she was receiving any emails sent from her iPad using her clintonmail address.  

In one of the email exchanges, Mrs Clinton expressed her concern over the leak of classified information to the media. She wrote: 'I think this is both dishonorable and dangerous and want to find way to say it. 

Clinton's spokesman Nick Merrill said during her time as secretary of state Mrs Clinton primarily used her iPad to read news clippings.

Earlier, Mrs Clinton said she used her own personal account instead of a government one as it was more convenient. 

Mrs Clinton became secretary of state in 2009 - a year before the iPad was launched. At the time she used a BlackBerry as a mobile email device. 

She said: 'Looking back, it would have been probably, you know, smarter to have used two devices.' 

Already, Mrs Clinton has admitted to exchanging some 60,000 emails during her four years as part of President Obama's administration. 

Around half of these emails related to personal business, such as the death of her mother, he daughter's wedding and her own yoga routine. 

Many of these emails have been deleted. Although Mrs Clinton said she did not send any classified material over her personal network and the security of the system was not breached. 

However, Republican Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attacks said Mrs Clinton's use of a personal email account has allowed her to 'clean' her email server and delete correspondence to the attacks.   

Clinton's attorney said she had turned over to the State Department all work-related emails sent or received during her tenure and it would make no sense to turn over her server, since 'no emails ... reside on the server or on any backup systems associated with the server'.
