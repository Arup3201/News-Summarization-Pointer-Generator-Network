A man has been left with severe brain damage after he was attacked in his sleep by a thug who was out on licence from prison.

Russell Lambert, 55, was assaulted with a metal bar by 27-year-old Clive Malone following a 'minor argument' at a birthday party in Great Yarmouth in February.

Hiding his face with a hat and a scarf, Malone broke into Mr Lambert's home, before attacking him and his brother Patrick, 62, with the weapon as they slept.

Five months on, Mr Lambert remains in a poor condition in hospital with significant brain damage, paralysis and loss of sight, Norfolk Police said.

Now, Malone has been found guilty of attempted murder at Norwich Crown Court.

He had already admitted grievous bodily harm, one count of attempted 
grievous bodily harm and aggravated burglary.

The trial heard Malone had been out on licence from prison after carrying out two knifepoint robberies at the time of the attack.

He met Mr Lambert and his brother at a birthday party, where the trio fell out and started arguing. Malone left only to return with a friend later that night to attack the brothers.

He forced his way into their home, before assaulting the pair with a metal bar in an 'extremely violent' attack, the court heard.

Detective
 Chief Inspector Paul Durham, from the Norfolk and Suffolk major 
investigation team, said: 'This was an unprovoked and extremely violent 
attack on people Malone knew and had previously socialised with.

'This
 results serves to remind people that Norfolk Police will always take 
swift and appropriate action against anyone who behaves in such an 
unacceptable manner.'

In a statement, Mr Lambert's family said they were 'overwhelmed' with the guilty verdict.Â 

They said: 'We came here to seek justice and it has been delivered. Although this man is going to prison his punishment is nothing which Russ has to bear.

'He has ruined Russ's life completely and what he has done has had a devastating effect on the whole family.'

Malone, from Yarmouth, is due to be sentenced 
in October.
