 A Toronto writer has lashed out at people in the fashion industry, calling them 'd***s' after a few 'badly behaved' guests at a plus-size runway show barely concealed their snide sniggers at the curvier than normal proportions on the catwalk. 

Disgusted: Writer Kevin Nualls overheard people laughing and making jokes at the models

At an Allistyle event hosted by Canadian designer Pam Shainhouse last week, Kevin Nualls was disgusted to overhear people laughing and making jokes at the expense of the models. 

‘Are we so unwilling to accept plus-size fashion shows because it is a reminder of who we could become?’ He wrote in Monday’s Toronto Standard sparking an explosion of similarly impassioned reactions from readers. 

Mr Naulls was quick to admit in his story that he used to weigh 300lbs and worried excessively about being perceived as fat.

But after jumping on the healthy living bandwagon and shifting 80 lbs, he recalled the moment he realised he might never entirely lose his slightly rotund gut and stopped worrying. 

The writer was excited to take a friend to one of the shows during World Mastercard Fashion Week and chose the Allistyle because of its special platform. 

Pam Shainhouse launched the clothing line in tribute to her daughter Alli in 2006 who as a victim of Hogkin’s Lymphoma at the time was battling with fluctuating weight gain.

Alli passed away and Mr Naulls saw the runway show as a moving legacy to Alli and a fun introduction to fashion week. 

His friend, he wrote, was ‘was excited, and yet, not one person outside of me and the Globe’s Tiyana Grulovic was excited for him. “You brought him to this as his first fashion show?” was the general consensus from people we spoke to.’

During the event, Mr Naulls noticed one man hiding behind his line sheet to cover his face as he laughed and others whispering and chuckling together.

Some of the models admitted to becoming 'tearful and angry' when they learned what had happened

‘Even four different people were overheard talking about how poorly the women walked because they were bigger women on high heels,’ he recalled. 

Outraged by the tactless response and shocked that a woman who isn’t rail thin might be considered a laughing stock by the fashion elite, Mr Naulls ranted: The next time I hear or see someone laughing at a plus-size model on a Toronto runway, I’m going to get up and walk that person out of the room. ‘If you can’t behave, you’re going home.’

His article has fuelled its own response by angry readers who share his disappointment in the fashion line. 

‘It's not just fashion week in Toronto that brings the "D***" out in people,’ wrote one. ‘I am plus sized and not a model - imagine what that brings out in people.’

‘I wish I had been at this show and could have celebrated the talented designers and beautiful models who were involved!’ Wrote another more optimistic reader.

One of the models in the show also weighed in with a personal post. 

‘The first time I read this piece, I teared up,’ she wrote.

‘The second time, a rage began trembling in my gut. I was a model in the Allistyle show... I was honoured to be walking in World Mastercard Fashion Week, and to be representing not only a cause I believed in, but a generation of women and girls who have been told that  - as is - their bodies are not good enough.

‘I’m a size 10. And I’m still a damn model. 40” hips and all. And I’d challenge the gentleman hiding his snickers behind the line sheet to call me on it.’
