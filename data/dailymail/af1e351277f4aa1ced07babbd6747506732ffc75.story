The pro-union Better Together campaign has been criticised for a ‘sexist’ advert aimed at winning the support of undecided women voters ahead of the Scottish referendum.

Nationalist supporters claimed the video, which features a mother talking to the camera about her concerns about independence, depicts Scots women as ‘daft ditherers’.

In the broadcast, first shown on Scottish television on Tuesday night, the woman played by an actress says: ‘there’s only so many hours in the day and there’s so much to weigh up’.

The 'No'  campaign has been ridiculed in Scotland after releasing a 'patronising' video urging voters to reject independence

Parodies images of the film have been posted online, showing a 'busy mum'

The images mock the message of the official 'Better Together' campaign film

She says that her off-screen husband, ‘Paul’, keeps going on about the referendum and she refers to First Minister Alex Salmond as ‘that guy off the telly’.

A spokeswoman for nationalist campaign group Women For Independence said: ‘We think it's disappointing that Better Together decided to portray Scotland's women in this way.

‘The narrative suggests that women who are still making up their minds how to vote don't understand enough about the issues to arrive at an informed decision. That is not our experience. They are thoughtful, intelligent and articulate.’

The video has been mocked online with people nicknaming the woman ‘Patronising BT (Better Together) Lady’ and posting their own spoof versions of the advert.

In one the woman is quoted as saying: ‘Maybe I won't even bother voting. It's too much hassle. I'll let the men decide whilst I bake cookies in the kitchen!’

Another Twitter user posted: ‘#PatronisingBTLady leave the kitchen and shape your future. The dour sexist NO camp want to transport us back to fifties. Over my dead body!’

While one added: ‘Trident, foodbanks, unelected Lords? I’ve got a kitchen to clean.’

Better Together said the wording of the advert was drawn from the verbatim comments of women in focus groups and doorstep canvassing.

Campaign director Blair McDougall said: ‘The key factor for people isn't the love of our country - as both Yes and No voters love Scotland. The key factor is the love of our families.’

He added: ‘The words spoken in the film are taken verbatim from conversations on doorsteps with undecided women voters and from the opinion of women in dozens of focus groups around the country.

‘With so many unanswered questions, more and more of us are coming to the decision that it is just too big a risk to take with our kids' future.’

Women have become a key campaign target for both sides of the campaign. Polls have consistently shown that women are less likely to support independence than men.

Last night, pro-union campaigner David Ross sarcastically tweeted: ‘BREAKING: Nationalists don't like Better Together campaign material.’

A group of 130 business leaders yesterday urged voters to reject Scottish independence, saying the case ‘has not been made’.

Bosses of firms including Baxters soup, HSBC and The Co-op Bank signed the open letter, which said: ‘We should be proud Scotland is a great place to build businesses and create jobs ... success that has been achieved as an integral part of the UK.’

Meanwhile, past rivals Alistair Darling and Gordon Brown put their differences aside to share the No campaign platform, insisting ‘of course’ they are friends.

Mr Darling said the two ‘share exactly the same outlook on the sort of Scotland we’d like to see’.
