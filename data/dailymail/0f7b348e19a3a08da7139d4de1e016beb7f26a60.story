A Tennessee church is drawing criticism after it posted a message on its marquee which appeared to link Satan and the LGBT community's quest to secure equal rights.

The Knoxville Baptist Tabernacle posted the controversial message, but took it down after experiencing some backlash. 

Before it was removed, the marquee read: 'Remember Satan was the first to demand equal rights.'

Many people felt the sign was meant to offend those who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender

Pastor Tony Greene said the message on the marquee was 'not a statement against any one group in particular'

After the message was posted, it began being shared on the Facebook and Twitter pages of WATE.

Many people felt the sign was meant to offend individuals who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender, but the Tabernacle's pastor said that was not the case.

Pastor Tony Greene said: 'Our sign referencing Satan demanding his equal rights to ascend into the heavens and be God was simply all about that individual.

'It was not a statement against any one group in particular, you know what about the rights of the unborn babies, the rights of children, the rights of everyone?'

Some did not buy Greene's explanation.

Andy Henry told WBIR: 'It's clearly a sign that was meant to offend a particular community - the LGBT community. 

'Because of (the church's) lack of foresight, they ended up offending everybody who had ever fought for equality or civil rights in general.'

The sign was changed to read: 'Glad you reading, did not intend to offend, we all need Christ.'

Greene said: 'We are a diversity congregation of people.

'We've reached people that know us and know our stand in this community know what we've done.

'My heart breaks in the dividedness of our country.'

The Tabernacle 'not only supports soul-winning at home, but also supports evangelism and church-planting in America and around the world', according to its website. 

The church has missions in Brazil, Peru, Mexico, Haiti, Ireland and Scotland.   

It will have another message posted later this week, according to the pastor.
