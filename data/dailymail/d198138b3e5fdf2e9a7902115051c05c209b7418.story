Tragic: Beth McDermott, 16, died after being thrown from her bike on Wednesday

A headteacher today paid tribute to a 'creative' and 'popular' 16-year-old pupil who died after she was thrown from her bike.

Beth McDermott was cycling just a mile from her home in Cambridge when she collided with two cars on Wednesday evening.

The teenager was rushed to Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge but died in the early hours of Thursday morning.

Beth attended Long Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge and was taking A Levels in psychology, geography, photography and art.

Principal Christine Sherwin said: 'She was a very creative young person with brilliant ideas and was able to demonstrate independent approach to her studies very early on in the courses.

'She was committed to her studies and always willing to put in the extra effort to achieve her very best.

'She was a popular student who got on really well with everyone in lessons.

'Staff and students at the College were very upset and are still coming to terms with this devastating news and our sympathies go out to her parents and all those who knew her.'

Flowers were laid at the scene - near Milton Road in central Cambridge.

One hand-written note read: 'RIP Beth. You were a star, you were beautiful and such a talent. You will be wholly missed. Love you forever, from Bailey xx.'

In memory: Flowers left near to the scene - which was only a mile from the girl's home in Cambridge

Another said: 'Dear our beautiful Beth. You are a true inspiration to everyone, especially me. Drama and English were the best lessons, you made me smile all the time.

'I will remember all the amazing memories we made together. Miss you gorgeous. Everyday. Beautiful and wonderful, I love you very much. All my love Debs xx.

'P.S You better still have amazing legs by the time I’m up there with you.'

The accident involved a yellow Peugeot 307 car which had its windscreen smashed and a grey Audi A3 TDI. Neither driver was injured.

At the scene a bobble hat circled by chalk lay in the middle of the road outside a pub and a buckled bicycle, with front wicker basket, was on a grass verge.

Other friends paid tribute on Twitter. One wrote: '@Angeelanderson RIP Beth Mcdermott, you didn’t deserve to go, sleep tight beautiful x'.

Another tweet said: '@GeorgiaRansome Was so shock and upset to hear about Beth McDermott, was always such a lovely girl to talk to in photography £RIP'.

Tributes: The 16-year-old schoolgirl, who attended Long Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge was 'creative' and 'committed to her studies', the principal said
