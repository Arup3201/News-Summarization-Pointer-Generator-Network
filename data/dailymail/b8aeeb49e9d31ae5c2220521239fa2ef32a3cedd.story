 

As countries in the Indo-Pacific prepare to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the devastating Boxing Day tsunami, survivors are gathering all over the region to remember the tragedy that a decade ago left an estimated 230,000 people dead.

When the disaster struck Australia pledged $1 billion in humanitarian funds and played a key role helping with the overwhelming task of identifying thousands of victims. The tsunami was triggered by a 9.1-magnitude earthquake, which struck off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, and hit coastal communities across the Indian Ocean.

The main commemoration ceremonies are planned in Thailand and Indonesia where the worst death and destruction took place. Twenty-six Australians were among the more than 5,000 people killed when the tsunami hit Thailand.

In total, more than 280,000 who were killed or are missing as the devastating waves struck 14 nations around the Indian Ocean

A series of ceremonies will be held in the country over the next three days to remember the victims. More than 4,000 people lost their lives at Khao Lak, north of Phuket, where many Germans and Scandinavians were holidaying.

ABC News reported that local man Anukul Charoenkul filmed a video of the first wave hitting Khao Lak. The video, which was seen around the world, shows a lone man staring down the wave.

Seconds later, he is dead, and the wave destroys everything in its path.

'I saw people walk down to the water and start filming,' he said.

'I saw the line of [the] wave and it was coming to the beach. I still had time to warn people to come up. I was trying to shout – I shouted, 'Get out, get out'.'

Thousands of Indonesians gathered in Banda Aceh, the capital of Aceh province on Sumatra, to hold a memorial service. Banda Aceh was largely flattened by the earthquake and subsequent waves and around 170,000 people died.

Indonesia bore the brunt of the disaster, with 130,736 people losing their lives. Sri Lanka suffered the second highest number of deaths with 35,322 people killed in the tragedy.

The tsunamis also devastated coastal communities in India, the Maldives, Myanmar (Burma), Malaysia, Somalia, Tanzania, Seychelles, Bangladesh and Kenya.

In 2004 the devastated district of Banda Aceh in Indonesia is a sea of debris and destruction. Ten years on it is virtually unrecognisable

Coastal towns in India's Tamil Nadu state were devastated by the 2004 tsunami, which also hit neighbouring Sri Lanka.

Ten years later, residents of fishing communities in the state say they are still struggling with life.

While the government has pumped billions of dollars into reconstruction, many say life has not seen much improvement.

With government's compensation money over, many now stare into a bleak future.

'During the tsunami, we lost our children, our neighbours and everything else,' said fisherwoman Ammaponnu, who lost everyone in her family except her daughter.

'The government has tried to help us but nothing has worked. We are still poor and downtrodden.'
