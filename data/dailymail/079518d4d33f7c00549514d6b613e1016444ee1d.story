It was hard to spot a miserable Arsenal fan on Sunday as the Gunners won their second trophy inside three months following their 3-0 Community Shield victory over Manchester City.

The Gunners dominated the traditional curtain raiser between the FA Cup winners and the Premier League champions from start to finish, as Manuel Pellegrini's side struggled to contain the rampant north London outfit.

But what does the result mean for both teams over the course of the season? As it turns out, it isn't much as Sportsmail has put together 10 omens and stats which show how fortunes can change whether you win or lose the Wembley curtain raiser.

Turning point? Arsenal's Community Shield victory has good and bad omens for the Gunners

We're Gunner slip up at some point 

The last time Arsenal won the Shield and went on to take the ensuing top-flight title was 80 years ago in the 1934-35 season.

Title charge ahead for Wenger?

Arsenal's win by three goals is the largest winning margin in the Shield since the Gunners defeated Manchester United in 1998  - they would go on to challenge for the league title only to miss out by a point on the last day of the 1998/99 season.

Stick a treble on City 

But Arsenal's 3-0 in victory from 1998 would only inspire United to go on and win the treble the following season.

Wenger out?

The last two managers to win the Shield in David Moyes (Manchester United) and Roberto Mancini (Manchester City) were sacked before the end of the domestic campaign.

The Cup trumps the league 

Arsenal are the first FA Cup winners to beat the Premier League champions since Chelsea overcame Manchester United 4-1 on penalties following a 2-2 draw in 2009. Both would challenge for the league title the following season.

A third double for Wenger at Arsenal?

Winning the Shield was a high point... 

The last three winners of the Community Shield have failed to win a trophy in the following season.

Berlin beckons for the Premier League

The last two occasions Arsenal have featured in the Shield, a Premier League side has gone on to reach the Champions League final.

Lucky losers

The last time City lost the showpiece event, they went on to claim the league title at the expense of the team that beat them in the Shield, Manchester United.

Dominance...for the losers!

The last  league champions that failed to score and lose the Shield were Manchester United in 2000 - who then went on to win the Premier League by 10 points.

Fooled you all: As reigning champions, Manchester United won the Premier League by 10 points in 2001 despite losing the Community Shield without scoring a goal
