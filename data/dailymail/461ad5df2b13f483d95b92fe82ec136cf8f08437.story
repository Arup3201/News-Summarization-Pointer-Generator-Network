A crazed father who stabbed his partner and six-year-old son to death has sparked outrage after launching a bid to inherit his victims’ estate from behind bars.

Paul Chadwick, 35, was detained indefinitely in a secure mental health unit last year after going on a bloody rampage, knifing his son Joseph 25 times and his partner Lisa Clay 32 times at their home.

The father of one stabbed Miss Clay before turning the knife on his terrified son after he awoke to hear his mother screaming and ran into his parents’ bedroom.

But now the deranged killer is trying
 to get his hands on his victim’s £200,000 estate using a legal loophole
 reserved for victims of domestic violence.

Yesterday
 Miss Clay’s grieving family said they were ‘sickened’ after the 
paranoid schizophrenic lodged papers at the High Court demanding access 
to the £150,000 semi-detached home he shared with his 40-year-old 
partner in Bolton-le-Sands, Lancashire, his son’s £30,000 trust fund, 
and £16,000 in joint bank accounts.

To
 add further insult, he is demanding that his victim’s aunts, uncles and
 cousins, who stand to inherit the estate, fit the bill for his legal 
costs.

If he is 
successful, the test case could set a precedent for other killers to 
make claims on the grounds that their mental health was impaired at the 
time.  

Yesterday Miss 
Clay’s distraught family issued a statement saying: ‘We were stunned 
when we found out he was taking legal action to try to claim the 
inheritance.

‘He robbed them of their lives, their futures, and now he wants to take their money. This is a matter of justice.

‘This has caused a great deal of distress to us.

‘The thought that Lisa’s killer can profit from his crime is too appalling for words.

‘We can’t afford to be dragged into a lengthy legal fight.’

Miss Clay’s relatives, who do not want to be named, have been forced to raid savings to fight the killer’s case.

The
 law states those convicted of murder or manslaughter cannot inherit 
from their victims or profit in any way from their crimes.

But
 under the Forfeiture Act of 1982, there is clause allowing the rules to
 be bent if ‘the justice of the case requires the effect of the rule to 
be so modified in that case’ due to exceptional circumstances in the 
conduct of the offender or deceased.

For
 example, if a battered wife who has suffered years of violence at the 
hands of her partner suddenly retaliates and accidentally kills her 
partner without intending to, they may still be able to inherit his 
estate on his death.

Chadwick,
 who is currently being held at a secure hospital in Preston, lodged a 
claim at Preston High Court just three months after pleading guilty to 
manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility last September.

The
 landscape gardener, who had been due to visit a psychiatrist on the day
 of the double killing on April 9 last year, had been charged with 
murder.

But the plea to the
 lesser manslaughter charges were accepted following psychiatric 
reports, which led to the killer being transferred from Preston prison 
to the Guild Lodge facility near the city.

Preston
 Crown Court heard that Chadwick crept downstairs in the middle of the 
night to grab two kitchen knives which he stashed under the bed.

He
 stabbed his sleeping partner a number of times, but she managed to get 
out of bed and run downstairs for help when their six-year-old son 
appeared in the doorway.

Chadwick stabbed him three times before pursuing Miss Clay and knifing her in a frenzy.

When
 he returned upstairs to find his son still breathing, he plunged the 
knife three inches into his neck and took him back to his bedroom, 
laying his arms across his chest, before turning the knife on himself in
 a botched suicide attempt.

Chadwick's
 mother Susan discovered the bodies minutes later when she peered 
through the letter box after Joseph failed to arrive at day care that 
morning.

She called police after seeing Miss Clay's body lying in the hallway and Chadwick, lying wounded at the bottom of the stairs.

When he was interviewed by detectives, Chadwick claimed he wanted the three of them to be 'together in death'.

He said, ‘I feel awful, terrible, I wish I could turn the clock back. I have done wrong, I love my boy and my girl.

'I didn’t mean to. I killed them but I don’t know why I did it.'

Days
 earlier, Chadwick had complained of hearing voices and told his 
girlfriend, who worked part-time in a Marks & Spencer store, he was 
concerned that people thought he was gay.

Mr
 Justice King ordered him to remain in hospital handing him an 
‘unlimited’ restriction order, which means he will only be released on 
the consent of the Secretary of State.

But
 Chadwick has managed to contact lawyers who lodged a claim arguing that
 because he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia when he carried 
out the attack he is still entitled to the assets and house bought by 
Miss Clay using money she inherited from her family because he was the 
beneficiary of her will.

His
 claim submitted by law firm, Clarkson Hirst, states: ‘In light of the 
claimant having suffered from an abnormality of mental functioning and 
with reference to the psychiatric evidence provided in criminal 
proceedings in relation to the offence, the claimant seeks a 
modification of the forfeiture rules… allowing him to inherit the estate
 of the late Lisa Jane Clay and the late Joseph Chadwick.’

He
 is seeking to fund his legal battle through monies from the estate and 
has launched a claim for ‘costs’ from his victims’ heartbroken 
relatives, who learnt of the action just days before Christmas last 
year.

Keith Etherington, of Slater & Gordon, who is representing Miss Clay’s family, said: ‘They are sickened.

‘There is a sense from the family this does not demonstrate any type of remorse for what he has done.

‘It has extended the suffering unnecessarily for these people.

‘This is a shameful action. It has put them through costs they can’t really afford.’   

He
 added: ‘We do not believe that the law was written to allow people like
 Paul Chadwick to benefit from his crime. We intend to fight his claim 
on behalf of the family.’
