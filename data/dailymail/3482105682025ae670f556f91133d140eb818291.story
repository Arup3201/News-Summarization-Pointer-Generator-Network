Zara Phillips walking with her 6-month-old baby Mia Grace during day three of the horse trials in Wiltshire

Zara Phillips has proved juggling being a new mother and an international sports star can be a walk in the park.

One moment she was clutching the reins of Mr Murt as she braved a water jump at the Barbury International Horse Trials. Then she enjoyed an afternoon stroll with her six-month-old daughter Mia Grace.

Mia, wearing a pink jumper, a hat and jeans, was carried in a harness. Zara chose jeans and bright blue trainers as she walked around the estate near Marlborough, Wiltshire.

It's not the first time Zara has been spotted successfully balancing her parenting duties with her racing.

Last month she and her husband Mike Tindall took baby daughter Mia to the Salperton Park Horse Trials in Gloucestershire.

In the adorable pictures taken at the trials, Zara was seen carefully positioning an ice cream cone in her mouth whilst holding up the five-month-old.

Husband Tindall took over watching their daughter so that Zara, daughter of Princess Anne and granddaughter of The Queen, could compete at the event.

Former world eventing champion Zara has landed a place in the Great Britain squad for the World Equestrian Games later this summer.

The riding star became the first member of the Royal Family to win an Olympic medal as part of Team GB back in 2012.

Her mother presented Zara with her winning medal at the celebrated event in London.

Zara’s inclusion in the World Equestrian Games, which start in August, mean she has a chance to represent Great Britain at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
