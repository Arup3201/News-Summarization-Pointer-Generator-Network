Court: Man City young player Courtney Meppen-Walter arrives at Magistrates Court in Manchester to admit charges of reckless and dangerous driving which caused the deaths of Kulwant and Ravel Kaur Singh

A Manchester City footballer is facing up to five years in jail today for killing a brother and sister in a road crash while driving his Mercedes at almost 60mph in a 30mph zone.

Courtney Meppen-Walter, 18, was arrested last September after his silver Elegance CDI car was travelling nearly twice the speed limit when it ploughed into a red Nissan Micra pulling out of a side street.

The impact in Cheetham Hill, Manchester claimed the lives of Kulwant Singh, 32, who was driving the Micra and 37-year old sister Ravel Kaur who was a front seat passenger.

Mrs Kaur's two sons Amjid and Parveen, who are 16 and 17-years-old, were sat in the back and were left fighting for life with serious injuries and had to be cut free from the mangled wreckage. They have since made a good recovery.

Police initially investigated whether Meppen-Walter from Blackley, Manchester was racing a friend in a VW Golf as both cars appeared to be accelerating and slowing down apparently to avoid speed cameras.

But they later ruled out the racing line of inquiry and freed the other driver without charge.

It emerged the double tragedy occurred just five months after Meppen-Walker was caught speeding at 54mph in another 30mph zone in Bury.

Today the Â£1,000-a-week defender who has been at City since 2003 and has represented England at under-17 level pleaded guilty to two offences of causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving.

He asked to be dealt with at Manchester magistrates court where jail terms cannot exceed six months - but the bench instead sent to him to be dealt with by a judge at crown court as they ruled the offence was too serious and bordered on dangerous driving.

Meppen Walker was given an interim driving ban pending sentencing next month.

The tragedy occurred at about 10.15pm on Saturday September 1 last year on Bury New Road at its junction with Sherborne Street.

At the time Mr Singh's was driving his sister and her children home from a Sikh temple and was due to return to collect his wife and their two children, aged one and three.

Meppen Walker looked stony faced as defence lawyer Mr Gwyn Lewis said: 'He is a very young man. He has been able to enter and plead on the very first occasion and accepts that he is responsible for this incident.

'His lack of driving experience contributed to a likelihood of a collision. He was driving in a straight line on the main road and he car had emerged unexpectedly. The right of way belonged with the driver on the main road but the issue arises out of the speed he was travelling at.'

Adjourning the case chairman of the bench Peter O'Keefe said: 'We believe it is not suitable for magistrates for sentence. We feel it was not far short of dangerous driving in addition the aggravating factors are too young people were seriously injured.'

Meppen Walker was granted unconditional bail until sentencing at Manchester Crown Court on February 28. A 19-year-old man who was driving the grey VW Golf at the time of the collision will face no further action.

At the time of the crash Balinder Singh, 19, a relative of Mr Singh and Mrs Kaur spoke of the two victims having 'joy on their faces' shortly before the tragedy.

He said: 'We get together every Saturday at the temple but this week there was a special ceremony because it was the first day of our Holy Book.

'It's always a happy service and it's a big day in the religious calendar. They had joy on their faces. Kulwant said he would take his sister and her children first because she lives nearby and then come back for his wife and kids.

'Kulwant's wife has been left with a one-year-old son and a three-year-old girl. He was a loving father - he would help anyone. Ravel's husband passed away a long time ago so the children have lost their father and their mother now.'
