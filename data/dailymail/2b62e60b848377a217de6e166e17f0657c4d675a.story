Arsenal have shown an interest in Steven Caulker in what would be a surprise move for the former Tottenham defender.

Manager Arsene Wenger has already expressed an interest in Caulker's Cardiff team-mate goalkeeper David Marshall and wants cover for centre-backs Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker.

Caulker is a target for Swansea while former club Tottenham, Southampton and Liverpool have also been sounded out.

Caulker, 22, has a release figure in his contract following Cardiff's relegation but would be keen to play if he makes the move.

The defender joined the Wales outfit for £8million from Spurs in July 2013 and was made captain by former boss Malky Mackay.

In his one season at the Cardiff City Stadium, the England defender featured in all 38 games for the club but was unable to prevent them from the drop.

Caulker had a successful spell on loan at Swansea in 2011-12.
