It is almost completely hidden from sight and looks like it hasn't been used in years.

But this overgrown telephone box is still fully functional.

The only red BT phone box in the village of Exning, near Newmarket in Suffolk has been almost completely covered by ivy for six months.

Hidden: Just three phone calls have been made in this telephone box in the last year

Just three calls have been made in the phone box in the last year with the last one made in June.

A spokesman for BT said: ‘It is a box 
that is still in use and three calls were made from it in the last year,
with the last one in June.

‘We haven’t had any complaints about the box from members of the public but we have seen a picture of the foliage and we will be sending an engineer to check the kiosk.

‘Foliage seems to have crept over from the neighbouring garden.’

When disgruntled residents found 
they couldn't even open the door, they decided to take matters into 
their own hands and cut back the ivy.

The unkempt phone box is perhaps a sign of the times when more people are using mobile phones than ever before.

By March this year, Ofcom said 92 per cent of the UK’s adult population had a mobile phone - more than 46million people.

The iconic telephone boxes were once a familiar sight on the streets of the United Kingdom, painted red to make them easily identifiable to the public.

Despite a reduction in their numbers in recent years, red boxes can still be seen in many places and in current or former British colonies around the world.

Some kiosks have been adopted by villages and used as mini libraries, information centres, art galleries and even a one-night only pub.
