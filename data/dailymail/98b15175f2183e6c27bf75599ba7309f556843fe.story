Almost 50 new Ebola cases have erupted in Liberia, harming the fight against an outbreak which has now infected more than 20,000 people across West Africa.

Medics had hoped they were finally beating the disease in Liberia after infection rates began to fall last month amid a global disaster appeal.

But today officials said 49 new cases had been identified in one part of one county - and they blamed them partly on the tradition of washing loved ones' bodies before they are buried.

Medics have been battling with locals to halt the tradition, which the World Health Organisation (WHO) previously said caused more than a fifth of fresh Ebola cases.

It has continued in some isolated communities where resources or health education are poor.

Liberia's Assistant Health Minister, who detailed the new cases today, said the body-washing tradition was to blame alongside other factors such as people crossing the border to and from Sierra Leone.

Speaking on state radio, Tolbert Nyenswah said the new cases had been reported between December 1 and Christmas Day in the western part of Grand Cape Mount County.

The region on the border with Sierra Leone had previously reported just 18 new Ebola cases in the three weeks leading up to December 24, the date of the WHO's latest full death toll update.

Mr Nyenswah said: 'In a very small population, an increase in the number of cases raises high level of concerns that we need to take very seriously as people of Liberia and people of Grand Cape Mount in particular.

Today the World Health Organisation confirmed more than 20,000 people have been infected since the start of the outbreak, with the death toll now standing at 7,842 worldwide.

A new test which it is claimed can diagnose Ebola in just three hours was approved today by U.S. regulators.

Swiss pharmaceutical firm Roche said the Lightmix test would help medics fight the disease by drawing their attention away from false alarms and ensuring quick treatment.

Certain laboratories in the U.S. and other countries are now authorised to use the test for a limited period to detect the type of Ebola that has been spreading.

It has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for general use.

More than a third were laboratory-confirmed cases in Sierra Leone, which is now the worst-hit country. 

The 49 new cases in Liberia represent a significant increase, however, because there were thought to have been just 121 new infections in the three weeks to December 24.

The country where 3,384 people have died of Ebola - more than any other nation - had been seeing a drop in the number of new infections since mid-November.

Part of the problem were religious customs in which family members wash a dead relative's body before burial, exactly the point at which Ebola is at its most infectious.

Last month the WHO's Dr Pierre Formenty said medics were 'building trust and respect between burial teams, bereaved families and religious groups'.

He added: 'Introducing components such as inviting the family to be involved in digging the grave and offering options for dry ablution and shrouding will make a significant difference.'

In its Christmas Eve update, however, the WHO admitted there was still more work to be done.

'While every country has sufficient capacity to isolate patients, the uneven geographical distribution of beds and cases means shortfalls persist in some districts,' a spokesman wrote.

'Each country has sufficient capacity to bury all people known to have died from Ebola, although it is possible that capacity is inadequate in some districts.'

Britain has pledged £230million to curb the outbreak in West Africa, including sending British doctors and matching the first £5million of public donations pound-for-pound. 

Officials have warned a failure to contain it could lead to it becoming an unstoppable outbreak, the way HIV did in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

However, cases have so far largely been contained within Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.

Because of Liberia's falling infection rate it has now been eclipsed by Sierra Leone, but Liberia still has the record for the highest number of deaths.

The most deadly previous outbreak in 1976, the first ever recorded, infected 318 people and killed 280 in the country now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo.
