The family of a young disabled girl were shocked and angered when they were told their daughter wouldn’t be able to access a museum because her wheelchair would ‘get the carpets dirty.’

Lexi Hass, 11, from Charlotte, North Carolina suffers from a rare neurological condition called Kernicterus that has left her physically non-functional.

She and her family spent the weekend in Savannah, Georgia and had planned to visit the Ships of the Sea Museum on Sunday but were told they wouldn’t be able to bring Lexi’s wheelchair into the museum.

Lexi Hass was refused entry to the Ships of the Sea Museum in Savannah, Georgia because of concerns that her wheelchair would spoil their carpets

The Ships of the Sea Museum in Savannah, Georgia is housed in an old building, but that isn't the reason that Lexi was refused entry

Lexi’s father Dr. Stephen Haas told WBTV that he thought it might be difficult for his daughter to visit the museum because it is housed in a historic building, but he said the reason given ‘didn’t make any sense’.

The family were told they couldn't bring in Lexi’s almost brand new wheelchair because it would get dirty the carpets.

When Lexi’s father pointed out that the wheelchair was no dirtier than his shoes, he was told his daughter could use a wheelchair that the museum owns.

‘Apparently the Ships and Sea Museum in Savannah Georgia has a policy that wheelchairs from the outside are not allowed on the carpet but shoes are allowed,’ the family posted on Lexi’s Facebook page.

That wasn’t a viable option for the Haas family as Lexi’s wheelchair has special straps because she can't sit up on her own.

The museum then suggested that Lexi could sit outside and watch a video while the rest of her family walked through the exhibit.

‘They really need to train their staff. They really do. It's a significant error and significant departure in the current thinking on disability access,’ Lexi's mother Susan Haas told WBTV.

The family decided not to enter and have since received an apology email from the museum's director, and accepted that apology.

Lexi's mom Susan has said the museum needs to train their staff better, while father Dr. Stephen Hass said the reason given for not accepting his daughter 'didn't make any sense'

They aren't looking to file an Americans with Disabilities Act complaint, but just want to make it clear that this type of thing is not acceptable.

Museum curator Wendy Melton has blamed the mix-up on an employee who misunderstood the museum's wheelchair policy. She said she has spoken with the employee and made the policy clear for the future.

Lexi was angry about not visiting the museum as she enjoys learning, but her parents took her for ice cream instead and enjoyed the rest of her stay in Savanna.
