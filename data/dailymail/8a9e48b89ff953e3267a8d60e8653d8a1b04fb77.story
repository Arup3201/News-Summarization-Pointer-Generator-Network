Australia's most expensive home may have sold for $100 million this week, but the record breaking price is being kept under wraps.

Experts believe the new home owner could be from overseas, with the price tag on the waterfront mansion in Sydney's affluent eastern suburb of Point Piper out of reach for most Australians,

The heritage-listed property known as 'Elaine' was first listed on the market January by luxury agent Christie's International Real Estate.

Australia's biggest ever home may have sold for $100 million but the record breaking price is being kept under wraps

Located in Australia’s most expensive suburb, the magnificent three-storey mansion features seven bedrooms, seven full bathrooms, a ballroom, sandstone walls and a sprawling garden with century-old trees.

With an estimated 53-metre beach frontage, it features a multimillion-dollar harbour view, tennis court and is nearly three times the size of a nearby home 'Atona' home, which sold for $52 million in May last year.

Built in 1863, the grand Victorian style mansion has a ballroom and numerous balconies with stunning Sydney Harbour views.

Situated on one of Australia's finest beaches, Seven Shillings Beach, it comes with a semi-private beach that runs along the Point Piper waterfront.

'Elaine' has been handed down through four generations in the Fairfax family

The heritage-listed property has been owned by the Fairfax family - who founded Fairfax Media - since 1891 and has been handed down through four generations.

John B. Fairfax bought the 6900 square metre harbour-front property from his father, Sir Vincent Fairfax for $3 million in 1989.

The land is sprawled across six separate titles and new home owner could potentially build additional homes or even apartments on the site. 

However real estate agent Ken Jacobs from Christie's told the Daily Telegraph that no sale price had been confirmed.

‘In fact even the owners have not put a price on it,’ Mr Jacobs said.

‘There are no comparable properties, so that makes it difficult to gauge a price.

‘Nothing like this come has onto the market before and the anticipation it has created is extraordinary.

‘But I can say that it will be a new Sydney record.’
