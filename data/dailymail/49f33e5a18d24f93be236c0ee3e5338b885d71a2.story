Payday: Sir Alex Ferguson, pictured today at Lingfield racecourse, has agreed a £2million deal to make 20 appearances a year as a Manchester United ambassador

Sir Alex Ferguson has agreed a £100,000-a-day deal to make 20 appearances a year as a Manchester United ambassador.

The football manager, 71, is also receiving a £2million advance for his second autobiography which will be published in the weeks leading up to Christmas.

Sir Alex is cashing in after retiring as Manchester United manager following the club's final game of the season last Sunday.

He announced he was standing down earlier this month after winning Manchester United's record-breaking 20th league title.

In 26 years with the Old Trafford club he won 38 trophies - including 13 Premier League titles and two Champions League trophies.

Ferguson's lucrative deal to represent Manchester United as an ambassador was thrashed out by his son Jason.

Analysts believe he could also demand £100,000 a time delivering speeches on the business management speaking circuit around the 
world.

Nine years ago the club pledged never to do business again with Jason Ferguson's agency.

Jason’s disbanded Elite Sport ceased to act on United transfers following an internal inquiry into 99 questions posed by United’s then major shareholders, John Magnier and JP McManus, which put Sir Alex’s transfer dealings under unprecedented scrutiny.

But the wheel has turned to the extent that Ferguson's reported £2million-a-year United ambassador deal was negotiated by Jason.

The manager has been inundated with offers of work after announcing that he was standing down from his position.

Three years ago he agreed a deal to write a second autobiography, to be published in October, for which he will be paid a £2million advance.

The book, to be published by Hodder and Stoughton, will be ghost-written by sports journalist Paul Hayward. It will be the football manager's second autobiography, 14 years after his first book was printed.

Although he has stood down as manager, Ferguson will remain at Old Trafford as a director of the club.

Sir Alex's successor will be Everton manager David Moyes who takes who officially on July 1.

However, the Scotsman has already held talks with the club's backroom staff as he begins work on an unofficial basis.

Moyes will take control of Manchester United for the first time in a competitive match on August 11 when they play FA Cup winners Wigan in the FA Community shield.

Sir Alex was in charge of United for a total of 1,500 games. His side drew his final game in charge 5-5 at West Bromwich Albion last Sunday.
