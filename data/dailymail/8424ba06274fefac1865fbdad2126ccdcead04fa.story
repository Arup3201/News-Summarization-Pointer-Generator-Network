A federal aviation official says a commercial airliner nearly collided with an unmanned drone aircraft earlier this year in a near-catastrophic indecent that demonstrates the risks of the growing number of drones in U.S. skies.

An American Airlines pilot told federal aviation officials about the March 22 incident when he says a small, remote-control aircraft came dangerously close to his plane about 2,300 feet above the ground over Tallahassee Regional Airport, said Jim Williams, manager of the Federal Aviation Administration's Unmanned Aircraft System Integration Office.

'The airplane pilot said that the UAS was so close to his jet that he was sure he had collided with it,' Williams said at an industry conference on Thursday, referring to an unmanned aircraft system.

The aircraft, operated an American subsidiary, did not show damage when it was inspected after the March 22 incident, Williams said.

But 'the risk for a small UAS to be ingested into a passenger airline engine is very real,' Williams said. 'The results could be catastrophic.'

Williams says aviation officials need to understand the risks of including unmanned drones into the complex U.S. aviation system.

'It's important to 
develop solutions and answers to these questions before we risk the 
safety of the world's safest aviation system,' he told the conference.

Catastrophic: Aviation officials say that if a drone is sucked into the engine of an airliner, the results would be catastrophic

The Wall Street Journal reports that Williams used to the famous 'Miracle on the Hudson' - when a U.S. Airways flight was forced to land in New York City's Hudson River after a flock of birds were sucked into the plane's engines - to illustrate the dangers drones pose to commercial aircraft.

'Imagine a metal-and-plastic object, 
especially that big lithium battery, going into a high-speed turbine 
engine,' he said. 'The results could be catastrophic.'

Gretchen 
West, executive vice president for drone trade group Association for 
Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, echoed Williams' concerns about the lack of clear FAA rules regulating drones.

'A lot
 of people already fly [drones] without rules and regulation. It's 
almost a free for all,' she said Friday, noting that Williams 'is painting a 
picture that this technology could threaten safety, but that goes back 
to the FAA. They have to come up with the rules to create a safe 
environment.'

Risk: Aviation officials say the risk of a drone getting sucked into the engine of a commercial jet is 'very real'

In his address, Williams also showed videos of several drone accidents, including one in which a drone crashed into a crowd during the running of the bulls in Richmond, Virginia, last fall. The incident was caused by a battery failure and there were minor injuries, he said.

The FAA currently bans the commercial use of drones in the United States and has come under growing criticism for failing to set rules that would permit their broader use.

Last year, the agency began establishing test sites where businesses can try out commercial uses.
