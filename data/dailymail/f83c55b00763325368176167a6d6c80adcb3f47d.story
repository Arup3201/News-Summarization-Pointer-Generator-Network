A village cricket team has been banned from hitting sixes after an angry neighbour threatened to take the club to court over balls landing in her garden.

Diana Attenborough, 69, complained that it was dangerous if the heavy cricket balls fell within the grounds of her detached home which lies at the end of the club’s grounds.

Now Britwell Salome Cricket Club in Oxfordshire has been forced to introduce a ban on batting sixes and has had to spend over £4,000 on installing a 50ft high net.

Dispute: Diana Attenborough, 69, who owns the circled house, threatened to take the club to court

Dispute: Ross Joyner, the captain of the cricket team, explained how protecting Diana Attenborough's house from cricket balls has cost the club its savings

But yesterday, the club, which has used up all of its financial reserves to meet Miss Attenborough’s demands, discovered that the grandmother has put her £850,000 home up for sale.

Chairman of the club, Nigel Joyner, said: ‘We play on average two games a week for five months a year and have been in the village for over 85 years, in all that time we have not had any complaints other than those from Diana.

‘About two years ago she complained and threatened to take an injunction out to stop the club playing cricket but we managed to come to an amicable decision in January.

‘But it means we’ve had to use up all of our funds, money we had hoped to use to replace our tractor so we can cut our grass and build a new shed as the old one is falling down.’

The 61-year-old businessman added: ‘We understand she is concerned and a ball has gone over and smashed a pane once before which we covered the cost for but it is odd that she has now put her house on sale.

‘Either way the net, which unfortunately is a bit of an eyesore because of the great white posts, will prevent any future problems there.’

Village green: A £4,000 net will have to be erected and draped between the three poles at one end of the pitch

Team captain Ross Joyner, 30, added: ‘Cricket is a way for many people to keep fit and socialise, its a shame how one person can ruin that for the others.

‘There seems to be a lot of health and safety cases being taken to the extreme across the board and its a bit worrying if that continues in this way.’

The club, which has around 30 members with games being played between May and September, is now enforcing a ‘local rule’ after consulting the Oxfordshire Cricket Association.

The new rule means that if a player hits a six, no runs will be allowed to be scored.

However, residents of the affluent village of Britwell Salome near Watlington said that they supported the cricket club and had no reason to be concerned.

One villager has even donated £400 to cover the cost of the net which will be installed on three 50ft posts which the club had made and shipped in from Norway.

Rules: The club has also instituted a new rule discounting any runs scored from sixes

A neighbour, who lives near the grounds but did not want to be named, said: ‘We all love the club and have never had any problems. It is mainly dads and sons from the village who play.

‘It is only the odd ball that comes over every now and then, and the club would cover the cost of any damage caused.

‘I can’t see why such a fuss has been caused, particularly as Diana has put her house up for sale. It is just a local club and it cannot afford paying for all these measures.’

Another villager added: ‘The club is part of our community, it puts on events for the village and allows dog walkers to use it grounds.

‘It has always been there and she (Diana) knew it was there when she moved in.

‘If you live next door to a cricket pitch what do you expect?’ The club initially installed a 15ft high net after first receiving the complaint from Miss Attenborough but balls continued to land in her garden.

Miss Attenborough, whose son is a barrister, has given the club a month to demonstrate that the problem has been solved by the new preventative measures.

The grandmother, who has lived in her house for eight years, said: ‘The old net was much lower so the balls came over and made it very dangerous to be in the garden. We came to an amicable solution.’

Mr Joyner, 30, said the club, which survives on donations and money from fundraising events, will now have to find funds to buy a £3,000 tractor and £1,000 to build a new shed for storage from other means.
