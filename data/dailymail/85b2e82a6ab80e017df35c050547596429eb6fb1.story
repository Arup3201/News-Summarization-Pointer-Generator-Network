A lawyer who took part in a round-the-world yacht race is suing its organiser, sailing legend Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, alleging victimisation and harassment.

Top employment lawyer Ruth Harvey, 50, from Wanstead, east London, paid £40,000 to take part in the notoriously tough Clipper Round The World race, which began last September and finished last month.

Many of the 670 crew who take part in the 40,000-mile race are inexperienced sailors, and many of them drop out - as Ms Harvey did - before the finish line.

Despite her not completing the race, her yacht, Jamaica Get All Right, crossed the finish line in London in eighth place.

Now the lawyer, who admitted before the race 'I am pretty scared, to be honest' - is claiming that as a crew member she was an employee of the race organisers, and is suing on the grounds of both victimisation and harassment.

Ms Harvey, a former partner at American law firm Hunton & Williams, has decades of experience in her field of law.

A preliminary hearing of her case was heard in Southampton a fortnight ago, and she has not elaborated on her allegations.

But she told the law blog Roll On Friday: 'I was a worker for the provisions of the Employment Rights Act as regards safety and that I was covered by Equality Act provisions 'in any capacity' on board as regards harassment.

'Complex legal argument here involves both domestic and EU law, and similar recent cases have gone as far as the Supreme Court.'

A two-day tribunal in November will decide whether Ms Harvey can be classed an employee, despite her having paid to take part.

A spokesman for Sir Robin confirmed that they were involved in a 'tribunal process with Ms Harvey' and added: 'It is our policy not to comment further upon ongoing legal matters.'

Before she began the race last autumn, Ms Harvey set up a Just Giving fundraising page to make money for her chosen charity, Cornwall Air Ambulance Trust.

She wrote of the race: 'It will be an amazing and terrifying experience, taking 11 months, and covering 45,000 nautical miles.

'I am sailing on boat Jamaica, a fabulous team, and lucky enough to be skippered by the amazing Pete Stirling...

'I am circumnavigating because you get one life, and because the Cornwall Air Ambulance saves thousands of lives.'

The race was founded in 1995 by Knox-Johnston, 75, to allow people to have the chance to circumnavigate the globe for 11 months.

Before the race began, he and Ms Harvey enjoyed a better relationship.  The sailor, who in 1969 became the first person to single-handedly circumnavigate the globe non-stop, took part in a video made by Ms Harvey mimicking Sir Alan Sugar in The Apprentice.

Knox-Johnston said in the film: 'Ruth - I've never seen such a potential disaster in all my life.

'You're fired'.
