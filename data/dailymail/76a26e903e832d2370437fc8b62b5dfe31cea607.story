Sky Sports open as favourites to secure the British broadcasting rights for the richest fight of all time, at roughly the same 1-3 odds at which the Las Vegas casinos are quoting Floyd Mayweather Jnr to win it.

But when you are talking hundreds of millions of dollars and the two best pound-for-pound boxers in the world there are no foregone conclusions.

And when it comes to a bidding war for Mayweather vs Manny Pacquiao, nothing will come cheap for UK viewers.

BT have become a Premier League thorn in Sky's side.

They have been fidgeting for some time about adding live boxing to their portfolio and there could be no more spectacular way than this of throwing their hat in the ring.

Certainly, they can afford it.

The cost frame for screening rights in this country on the red-hot Saturday night of May 2 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena is expected to be £5million-£10m, with Sky likely to start pitching at £6m.

But the fiercer the competition the higher it could go, even though Money and the PacMan will not enter the ring much before 4am Sunday morning UK time.

BT possess untold riches and have not blinked at £10m per Premier League match. They also kept significant cash in hand by shrewdly under-bidding Sky while still expanding their package in that new deal.

With all due respect, if West Bromwich Albion vs Hull City is worth that kind of money then what price this fight so big that Pacquiao’s promoter Bob Arum describes it as ‘three Super Bowls rolled into one'?

Twenty million, thirty million, given that American television will generate $300m?

And BT are not the only potential rivals to Sky.

ITV are bringing world championship boxing back to mainstream terrestrial television for the first time in almost a decade with this Saturday’s defence by Carl Frampton of his super-bantamweight title against Chris Avalos in Belfast.

Mayweather-Pacquiao – not only live on the night but with replays airing Sunday lunchtime and on prime evening slots the following week – will bring with it expensive advertising opportunities.

Nor – unlike BBC – are ITV prohibited by their constitution from charging pay-per-view. They have not gone down this road before but what better way for them to take a first big step back into the big-time sports market?

Also, Frank Warren’s dedicated BoxNation channel is believed to be considering adding a comparatively modest one-off pay-per-view supplement to its £12-a-month subscription rates for this event of such magnitude.

Warren - like BT - can calculate a bid based on that charge plus a substantial surge in subscribers. He has also built up much goodwill with the US promoters by buying many of their big fights even when British boxers are not involved – Mayweather vs Maidana and Pacquiao vs Algieri significantly among them.

And what may the cost be to you, dear reader, boxing lover or member of the wider audience which this will attract?

Sky, conscious of the scale of their monthly fees, are deeply reluctant to raise any pay-per-view charge above their historic £20 thresh-hold.

If they stick to that, their critics may become their friends. But they will be desperate not to lose out on this one and the more they have to pay, the greater the pressure to charge more.

But however much you end up being asked to cough up, it will be peanuts compared with America.

Showtime, who have Mayweather under contract, and HBO, who are Pacquiao’s paymasters, are sharing the broadcast there – at an expected $99.95 a buy.

What they have to assess is that while Mayweather and Pacquiao are guaranteed $150m (£96) and $100m (£64) respectively, the local stations who take their satellite feeds get their share. That is normally 50 per cent, although there is talk of a lower percentage being agreed this time given the size of the pay-per-view charge.

The US pay-per-view sales record is 2.4million buyers for Mayweather vs Oscar De La Hoya in 2007. That is predicted to be broken now.

Even I can do the arithmetic that at a hundred bucks a shot three million buys equals $300m.

At that rate, if the local stations take a third that leaves $200m in the promotion pot.

Then come the overseas TV rights in some 200 countries, including Britain where sales should exceed the 1.2m record set for Mayweather vs Ricky Hatton, which was also an early-hours production.

Seats at the arena will be priced up to $5,000 (£3,300) or more at ringside – and are already selling on an advance promise on the black market for more than $25,000 (£16,500).

The MGM, whose group of hotels on that famous Strip will be the principle beneficiaries of a gaming bonanza that weekend worth anything up to a billion dollars to Las Vegas, will pay a substantial site fee.

It will cost $150 or more to watch closed-circuit transmission on large screens in their hotels.

A movie chain in America is negotiating to show the fight live in several hundred theatres – and it could be coming to a cinema near you, as did events such as this in years gone by.

The feeding frenzy has begun.

Floyd Mayweather tells Manny Pacquiao: ‘You’re moving up into a different league where you’ve never been and that’s why I’m 1-3 in the betting.’

The PacMan tells the Money Man: ‘I love being the underdog and you can’t cope with my speed.’

Manny: 'I signed the contract first.'

Floyd: 'I made it happen.'

There won’t be many rounds this even on May 2.

Gennady Golovkin has accepted not only Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr’s challenge to a fight but also a $1m (£650,000) side stake.

Golovkin smiled and said ‘sure’ when Chavez said he wanted to bet him that he will knock out the Kazakh at super-middleweight.

That requires Golovkin to move up from middleweight, where he is world champion following 29 stoppages in 32 unbeaten fights, including the last 19 in succession.

As the biggest pound-for-pound puncher in the world Golovkin has trouble finding big-name opponents and says he will gladly rise to the 12 stone limit to face Chavez and that bet ‘assuming he signs the contract this time.’

Chavez is committed to an interim fight in April and is Carl Froch’s target for his much-wanted fight in Las Vegas, perhaps this summer.

Golovkin, ever the gentleman, took time out to pose for a morning-after photograph in Monte Carlo with his latest victim, our own Martin Murray who courageously took him as far the 11th round for the first time in his career before suffering a brutal stoppage on Saturday night.
