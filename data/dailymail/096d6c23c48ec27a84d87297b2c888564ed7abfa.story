A photographer in South Dakota, has captured an extremely rare and stunning sight of a meteor speeding towards the Earth's atmosphere.

While on a family holiday in the woods in Custer, South Dakota, Wes Eisenhauer set up his camera on a clear, but rather uneventful night in hopes of getting some shots of the Milky Way.

'The sky was incredibly clear and free of any light pollution so I set my camera up, composed the shot, and let my camera click for about an hour while I went inside,' Wes told MailOnline.

The meteor appeared to break apart in a flash - and disappear into a stunning ring of dust

'I didn't even look at the pictures for about a week,' he wrote. 

'Then I decided to upload them and have a look - and discovered the meteor.'

Upon replaying his time-lapse footage, he spotted the quick movement and sudden pop as the space rock appears to break apart in the sky. 

Meteors can travel at speeds up to 50 miles per second and when they disperse - in this instance, into a ring of dust - it happens in a flash.

As stunning as the footage is, Wes, who primarily works as a wedding photographer, insists it was mostly just dumb luck.

'I randomly set my camera up and pointed it at that portion of the sky at that very moment,' he told MailOnline.

'I got pretty lucky, but I always try to take advantage of opportunities to take unique pictures.

'I didn't even feel like setting up my camera that night, but I'm glad I made myself do it.'

'I didn't even look at the pictures for about a week.'

'Then I decided to upload them and have a look - and discovered the meteor.' 

'The clip has gone crazy,' Wes wrote on his website.

'It was on the front page of Reddit and I've been hit up by licensing companies that work with National Geographic and the Discovery Channel.

The video has since gone viral on Reddit and has been viewed over 500,000 times

'I guess what was captured is a pretty rare occurrence.'

Some Reddit users even commented that the object may be space junk, such as parts of a rocket or satellite.

No matter what it is, the breathtaking video has been viewed over 500,000 times and was shot with a Canon 5D Mark ii camera and 16-35mm lens.
