England retained James Anderson in an unchanged 13-man squad for the fourth Investec Test against India, though they could yet be without the seamer if he is suspended by the International Cricket Council.

Anderson, who was man of the match in England's victory at the Ageas Bowl this week, faces a hearing on Friday to answer level three misconduct charges laid by the tourists.

India have accused Anderson of pushing all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja following a verbal row in the Trent Bridge pavilion during the series opener earlier this month.

England described the incident as 'minor' and issued their own charges against Jadeja, whose appeal against a 50 per cent match-fee fine will also take place on Friday.

If found guilty by the ICC's appointed judge, Australian Gordon Lewis, Anderson could be banned for up to four Tests - including next week's clash at his home ground of Old Trafford - but England have carried on regardless by naming the series' leading wicket-taker in their squad.

Any verdict on Anderson is not expected until Saturday at the earliest, with the hearing expected to be an exhaustive process featuring witnesses from both sides.

Should he be banned - or even miss the match while appealing against any sanction - one of Ben Stokes or Liam Plunkett, left out of the victory in Southampton - will return.
