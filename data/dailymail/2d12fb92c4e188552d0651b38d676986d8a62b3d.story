Police in Florida have released a shocking video that demonstrates the dangers of driving and texting.

A 23-year-old man was lucky to escape uninjured after his speeding car overturned while he was distracted by sending a text.

Michael James Woody was able to crawl out from the overturned car after it rolled over having struck a bus stop sign and tree.

A patrol car in Fort Myers, Florida, had been following the vehicle after the officer noticed the 2004 Pontiac was driving erratically.

His onboard camera captured what happened when the Pontiac suddenly accelerated before driving up on the sidewalks, striking a tree and sign before overturning.

After being quizzed by police Woody admitted he had been texting and took his eyes of the road.

Texting while driving is banned in Florida.

'Texting and driving is a serious epidemic. We hope the in-car video in this incident is a wake-up call to those that text and drive,' said Lee County police spokesman Lieutenant Victor Medico.

Woody was cited for careless driving and texting while driving.
