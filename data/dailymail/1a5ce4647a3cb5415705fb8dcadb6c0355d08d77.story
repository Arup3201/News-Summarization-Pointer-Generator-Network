Sir Martin Sorrell and his wife Cristiana: He may face having his £13million pay deal slashed after a shareholder revolt

The British boss of the world’s biggest advertising firm has been dealt a humiliating blow in the largest pay revolt of the current ‘shareholder spring’.

Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of advertising giant WPP, faces having his proposed £13million pay package cut after some 60 per cent of shareholders refused to back the reward.

The rebellion at the company’s annual general meeting in Dublin is the biggest against a FTSE 100 company’s remuneration report since regulations giving shareholders a vote were introduced in 2002.

Investors also staged large votes  against the re-election of the chairman, and the head of WPP’s pay committee.

Three of the firm’s biggest shareholders are thought to have voted down the pay proposals and shareholder advisory group ISS, which has 20 per cent of investors as clients, has not backed it.

The advertising agency is now under pressure to revise the £13million package it proposed for Sir Martin, which includes long-term share awards that bore fruit last year and a 30 per cent basic salary rise to £1.3million.

Under stock market rules, votes against Sir Martin’s pay and that of other executives are merely ‘advisory’, meaning shareholders cannot force bosses to slash their pay.

But a series of votes last month against the pay of other chief executives, including Sly Bailey of Trinity Mirror and Andrew Moss at Aviva, has seen some turfed out of their jobs.

Business Secretary Vince Cable is considering proposals to hand shareholders an annual binding vote on executive pay.

Annual meetings are normally sober occasions that focus on the previous year’s performance.

But WPP took the extraordinary step of mounting a two-hour presentation in praise of Sir Martin’s achievements during his 26-year tenure at the helm of the company.

Despite the praise heaped on him by his colleagues, Sir Martin’s expression remained thunderous and the rest of the board scowled for the duration of the meeting.

About 150 shareholders attended the event in Ireland, where the British firm moved to enjoy the simpler tax regime for companies.

The vote against the pay package is not binding and does not force WPP to reset its pay policy for 2011.

However the board will now have to reconsider the package in light of the protest vote.

WPP chairman Philip Lader, a former White House deputy chief of staff, told the meeting: ‘We take the remuneration report vote very seriously. We’ll consult with many share owners and will then move forward in the best interests of our share owners and our business.’

Guy Jubb, of Standard Life Investments, which holds just under two per cent of WPP shares, said: ‘The message from shareholders was unambiguous. It cannot be ignored.’

Sir Martin yesterday said: ‘It’s a democracy and the shareholders have spoken, it’s their right.’

But when asked whether he was considering his position in the light of the pay vote, he was unrepentant, pointing out that 98 per cent of shareholders had voted for his re-election in a separate poll.

A quarter of investors refused to back the re-election of Jeffrey Rosen, the chairman of the pay committee.

Mr Rosen said ‘The board remains committed to paying for performance,’ adding that he had consulted with shareholders but ‘there was a diversity of opinion’. The Institute of Directors (IoD) rounded on Sir Martin’s pay last night citing problems of excessive pay at large companies.

Roger Barker, head of corporate governance at the IoD, said: ‘I do think this vote is the right outcome.

‘Sir Martin Sorrell should really sit down and think about the lessons of this vote and the concerns of shareholders.’

Sir Martin, who founded WPP in 1985 and has invested and co-invested millions into the company, has defended the deal as reflective of his performance, after the group reported bottom-line profits of £1billion for the first time in 2011.

His pay package is made up of £1.3million salary, £2million annual bonus, £3million deferred shares and other benefits.

On top of the annual remuneration, he received nearly £6million in shares last year. These were awarded in 2006 and were closely-tied to performance targets, pension contributions and more than £1.3million in dividend equivalents.

Shareholder advisory groups, including the Association of British Insurers, and Pensions Investment Research Consultants, last week urged members not to back the advertising group’s ‘excessive’ remuneration report.

Writing in the Financial Times last week, Sir Martin warned if Britain wanted high achievers in the private sector, it needed to pay competitively.

He said: ‘The compensation debate in the UK now seems to have shifted from undeserving bankers paid for failure to what is fair pay.’

The vote is merely 'advisory', however, meaning that the company is under no obligation to cut his pay
