A heart-warming new calendar contains a year's worth of adorable pictures of cute hounds wearing hats.

The dogs pose in hilarious headpieces, ranging from a bulldog in a bowler hat to a corgi in a crown.

Some headgear even matches major events in the months the portraits illustrate, such as a retriever donning a Saint Patrick's Day hat in March and a chihuahua puppy wearing a straw hat and sunglasses in sunny August.

Hounds in Hats is the brainchild of the animal experts at Ardea photo library, who worked with calendar company Maverick Arts.

They used a mixture of images set-up by trained animal handlers and some produced using clever computer trickery.

Maverick managing director Steve Bicknell, said: 'My soft spot is the cover image, the dog in the cloth cap.

'I love the look on his face and the warmth of his expression and the inquisitiveness. The hat really gives you the character of the dog.'
