A talent show contestant ruined his chances of winning when he crashed off the stage and landed on the judges.

The karaoke king was performing Steppenwolf's Born to be Wild at a strip club contest in Croydon, south London when he tumbled off the podium.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the stage-dive didn't help the singer's shot at winning the competition and he missed out on the prize. 

Judges at a talent contest  in Croydon were given a shock when one the performers fell off the stage

The performer attempted to grab the podium's pole but missed and tumbled off the stage onto the judges

The accident happened at Larry Flynt's Hustler Club last month during the final of the venue's popular Talent Show night.

A recording made of the evening shows the performer, who has not been named, belting out the rock classic on the club's stage, which features a pole for the venue's usual performers.

In the footage, the man warms up the crowd by playing air guitar and posturing before attempting to swing around the pole at the centre of the stage.

But the man's hand passes several inches from the pole and he flies past it and - to screams from the crowd - falls straight off the stage and on to the line of judges.

Luckily, a judge manages to move out of the way as the man falls and the performer hits the ground with a thud, but is said to be fine.

The man then went for a party-piece move as he ran towards the pole in the centre of the stage to swing on it

But footage from the venue shows the man missing the pole completely and falling face-first, into the crowd

Uthania Jackson, manager of the club, was one of the judges and said the 'regular' was uninjured and has since been back for more.

She said: 'He was fantastic in the first heat and went straight into the final and was really getting into it, performing air guitar and everything.

'But he misjudged where the pole was by a few inches and landed on me. He didn't win unfortunately.

'He laughed it off and felt a bit embarrassed but carried on into the night.'

Mr Jackson was uninjured and instead chose to award the talent contest prize to a group of four women, called the 'Hustler Honeys', who performed a raunchy routine from Moulin Rouge on February 27.

The stage-dive could not have gone worse for the man's chances of winning the contest as he landed on one of three judges lined up to choose the winner

To screams from the crowd, he fell between two of the judges' chairs and landed with a thud on the floor

Uthania Jackson, the judge  hit by the man, said neither were injured and the incident was laughed off
