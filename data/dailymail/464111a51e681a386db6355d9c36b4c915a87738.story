A Jack Russell nicknamed 'Superdog' has become an internet sensation because pictures of him running on the beach make it look like he's flying.

Five-year-old Stanley was caught mid-leap running along Dunnett Beach, Caithness, with both of his paws off the ground - making it look like he's about to glide away like superman.

His owner, 59-year old Steve Arkley from Forres, Morayshire, adores the pictures and says they 'sum up his character perfectly'.

Stanley the Jack Russell has been compared to a superhero online after these pictures of him emerged in which he appears to be flying

Owner Steve Arkley said he was 'knocked out' by the reaction his pictures got on social media, attracting thousands of likes and comments within just a few hours of being posted

Speaking about his dog, Mr Arkley said that the pictures 'sum up his character perfectly' adding that Stanley 'loves life' and is 'very happy'

Other users have compared the pet to Bolt the wonder dog from the 2008 Disney animated film starring John Travolta as the title character

He said: 'Stanley absolutely loves life. He's very active, extremely loyal and loves being around people. He’s a very happy dog. I didn’t even realise that he ran like this until I took pictures of him.'

Mr Arkley posted the images on social media, where they attracted thousands of likes and comments within just a few hours.

Many users have likened the dog to a superhero including John Bruce Ferguson, who commented: 'Is it a bird, is it a plane, no it’s a Jack Russell.'
