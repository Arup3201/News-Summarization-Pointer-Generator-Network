Falkland's War hero Simon Weston beamed proudly as his 21-year-old son graduated from university.

The father-of-three, who survived a bomb attack with 49 per cent burns during the conflict, was a picture of delight as his son James gained a degree in mechanical engineering from Cardiff University.

The 51-year-old said it was particularly big honour for him because he left school without any qualifications to join the Army.

Achievement: James Weston, 21, has gained a degree in mechanical engineering from Cardiff University

An infantryman with the Welsh Guards, Simon Weston was only 20 when he suffered horrific burns in an Argentine bomb strike which killed 48 British servicemen and injured 150 in June 1982.

His injuries were so severe his own mother did not recognise him at first and he endured years of reconstructive surgery and skin grafts, including 70 major operations.

After the war he won praise for speaking publicly about his battles with post-traumatic stress disorder, which at times left him suicidal.

Those dark days seemed far away as Mr Weston - dressed in his formal robes as an honorary fellow of the university - embraced his 21-year-old son at his graduation.

He said: ‘It was a lovely day, I am a very proud father.

‘I left school without an A-level, an O-level or even a spirit level so it was a special day for me to see James collecting his degree. He worked very hard for it.’

James' achievement was all the more satisfying as he became an unexpected father mid-way through his studies.

Simon admitted he was surprised when James said his girlfriend Almanita was pregnant.

But in a column written for the Daily Mail last year, he said the arrival of Zachary in September 2011 had helped reunite his family.

He said his other son Stuart had dropped out of school, but found a new incentive to make something of himself after becoming an uncle.

There was another family celebration at Cardiff when Channel 4’s Grand Designs presenter Kevin McCloud received an honorary fellowship on the day his son Hugo was presented a Master’s degree in architecture.
