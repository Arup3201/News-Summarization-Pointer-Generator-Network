Myleene Klass made the headlines recently for complaining about the the cost of birthday presents for pupils at her daughters' school. 

But it seems the television presenter isn't alone - new research shows that children’s parties are fast becoming an expensive headache for many Brits, with parents under heavy pressure at the school gates to cough up for 'cheeky' gifts.

In a new survey, one in four mothers and fathers admit they have felt forced by fellow parents to spend more than they felt necessary on birthday presents.

Many parents actually agree with singer Myleene Klass, who last week said she felt under pressure at the school gates to cough up for 'cheeky' presents for other people's children

The findings suggest that many parents share the negative view of Myleene about being asked to donate money towards a class collection for birthday gifts.

One in eight of those polled said they had been asked to contribute towards a bigger present for a child, and of these, the majority (53 per cent) thought the request had been cheeky and that the child should be happy with what they received.

Only a quarter of those questioned  (28 per cent) said they were happy to contribute to a group present if it meant the youngster got what they wanted. 

In terms of cost, more than a third were asked to contribute less than £10, while a further 42 per cent could choose how much to give.

Classic FM presenter Klass hit the headlines last week after posting two emails she received 'from some school mums' detailing the parents’ preferences for 'a class gift for their daughters this year' - a desk and a Kindle. 

The group email suggested a donation of £10 each, but added that there was no obligation to join in.

Myleene posted the text of two emails she received from fellow parents, as well as her response

In a tongue-in-cheek reply, the 36-year-old mother-of- two, who lives in north London, jokingly said her daughter Ava might like a unicorn, adding that money could be donated at fictitious site www.getwhatyouregivenandendthismadness.com.

The singer later confirmed that the emails were a year old and she also admitted that there had been some hard feelings in the playground following the publicity.

But she maintained she was trying to convey a serious message and it was her intention to remind parents, who are under pressure to do the best for their children, of what birthdays should be about.

The  findings from the new research into birthday presents show that Myleene's school was towards the top end of the scale when it came to financial contributions. 

Around two-thirds of parents spend between £5-£10 on a gift to take to a child’s party, with a similar proportion saying they think this is the appropriate amount.

Only a fifth (23 per cent) spend £10 or more, and a similar proportion (22 per cent) think it is appropriate to do so.

The poll also found that while the vast majority of parents (85 per cent) buy a new gift to take to a party, more than one in four (27 per cent) have given cash, and 28 per cent have recycled a birthday present.

More than a third (35 per cent) have asked what the child wanted and then bought it.

Cathy Ranson, editor-in-chief of Netmums, who commissioned the survey for the Press Association, said: 'Putting on a birthday party for youngsters should be child’s play - but it seems to bring out the worst in some parents. 

'Over the last decade we’ve seen parties grow from simple affairs focused on the child to excuses for one-upmanship with ever more lavish venues and expensive gifts crammed into party bags.

'A recent study by Netmums found 16 per cent of parents now pay out more than £300 for a single party, with girls between the ages of two and four given the most pricey events.

'Shockingly, some parents admitted giving opulent gifts in party bags including jewellery, cameras, video games, phones, iPods and even tablets.

'While this may make the parents feel pleased with themselves, is it really what their kids want?'

She continued: 'Parties are about the people who go, not where they are held. 

'After the last crumb of cake is eaten and final present unwrapped, children’s happy memories are made of who they played with, not how much their mum and dad spent on the day.'

It is not the first time that children’s parties have come under the spotlight recently.

Last month, Derek Nash from Torpoint, Cornwall criticised a mother who sent him an invoice for failing to give notice that his son Alex would not be attending her child’s birthday party.

After his son did not go to the event, the birthday boy’s mother sent him an invoice for £15.95, saying that Mr Nash had left her out of pocket.

Mr Nash said he did not have contact details for the boy’s mother, but she said in a statement that all details had been on the party invite.
