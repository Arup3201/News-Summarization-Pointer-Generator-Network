J.J. Watt is already one of the best defensive players in the NFL, and now he is set to become the highest paid, as he has reportedly signed a six-year contract extension with the Houston Texans worth $100 million.

The 25-year-old, born Justin James Watt in Waukesha, Wisconsin, had 31 sacks for the Texans the past two seasons, and was named NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 2012.

Watt had two years left on his rookie contract before negotiations began, and was set to earn $1.9 million in base salary this season.

Loaded: J.J. Watt is set to earn $100 million over six-years, and a guarantee of $51.8 million, thanks to a new contract extension with the Houston Texans

ESPN Senior NFL Insider Chris Mortensen broke the news last night on Twitter, writing, 'Texans made it an even $100 million with $51.8 million guaranteed for JJ Watt, who was set to make $1.9 million this year, per source.'

Once confirmed, this would exceed the $96 million, six-year contract that the Buffalo Bills gave former Texans defensive end Mario Williams. He has a guarantee of $50 million.

This comes after several weeks of contract negotiations between Watt's agent, Tom Condon, and the Texans general manager, Rick Smith, who has a policy of not negotiating contracts once regular season play begins.

Watt has remained quiet on the situation, and when asked whether or not a new deal would get done before the season began just a few days ago, KHOU reports that he simply said, 'I would like it very much if it did.'

A star athlete at Pewaukee High School in Pewaukee, Wisconcin, Watt began his college career in 2007 at Central Michigan University, transferring after just one year to the University of Wisconsin.

Redshirted his first year at Wisconsin, he went on to start all 13 games at defensive end in 2009.

Then, after a 2010 season that included 59 tackles and seven sacks, he was selected as the No. 11 pick in that year's draft, signing a four-year deal worth $11.3 million with the Texans.

According to Forbes, Watt will receive a $10 million signing bonus with this new contract, and his base salary this year will be $907,385. That will then jump to $9.969 million in 2015. 

There is expected to be a news conference today at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, to announce the signing.

In just two seasons of NFL play, Watt has become known and admired by most in the league for his commitment to working hard and his dedication to the game, gladly giving up any sort of personal life in the process.

Retired linebacker Ben Leber posted a quote attributed to Watt on his Twitter last month that read, 'I have a limited amount of time to build a career out of football and be the best that I can be at this job. When this job is over, I have the rest of my life to do what I want with my time.'

The quote, which was reportedly in response to his teammates constant questions as to why he has no personal life, went on to say, 'Right now I am a football player and I will sacrifice whatever is necessary to be the best.' 

The footballer did however find time to start the Justin J. Watt Foundation, which supports after-school athletic programs in his home state of Wisconsin, and the state he now calls home, Texas.
