A new solar Kindle case lets readers 'top up' their gadget simply by leaving it in the sun - and could mean holidaymakers no longer have to bother bringing a cable.

The case has a built-in solar panel and battery - and the battery is guaranteed to provide three months of reading time in 'normal' sunlight, without dipping into the Kindle's own power.

The gadget goes on sale this week, priced at $80/£50.

The SolarKindle case charges a spare battery for Kindle directly from the sun and costs $80/£50

Once the gadget's topped up, the SolarKindle diverts power to a backup battery - eight hours will fully charge the backup , which offers roughly three weeks' use. The battery also powers an LED light

Once
the gadget's topped up, the SolarKindle diverts power to a backup 
battery.

Eight hours will fully charge the backup , which offers 
roughly three weeks' use. The battery also powers an LED light, which can run for 50 hours.

Given that Kindle is built for wireless 
use, with books and gadgets delivered to the gizmo via wi-fi or cellular
networks, it's likely many SolarKindle-equipped e-readers may never be plugged in at all.

The
leather-clad pouch with charger panel and battery comes at quite a 
premium, though - it's $80, only $30 short of the price of Kindle 
itself.

SolarKindle Lighted Covers are the first solar book covers for Amazon Kindle e-readers. The Solarfocus covers can hold a charge for up to 50 hours of use and come with a built-in LED reading light

The gadget also offers a built-in LED light, powered by the reserve battery.

'Expose the solar panel to sunlight and your Kindle will be constantly charging,' says SolarFocus.

If
your Kindle is running down and there's no sign of the sun, you can 
switch the gadget to 'top up' from the reserve battery. A blinking LED 
light tells you how much battery is left in the reserve as you charge.

'After
fully charging the Kindle, the solar panel automatically switches to 
charge the reserve battery. When charging, the LED indicator light 
blinks green. A one hour charge in direct sunlight can provide almost 
three days worth of reading time on your Kindle.'

'For
optimum performance, use the solar panel to continuously charge your 
Kindle – don’t wait for the battery to run out of power before 
recharging.'
