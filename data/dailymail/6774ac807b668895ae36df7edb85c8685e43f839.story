A bus driver has been left so scarred from a violent attack that he's unable to even get on a bus since the incident - let alone drive it.

In CCTV footage released to Nine News Melbourne, the bus driver can be seen recoiling - as a male teenager, in the midst of an ice binge, hurls verbal abuse at him before becoming increasingly violent.

Crying passengers were able to escape the packed bus, while the violent passenger's friend managed to restrain him from further attacking anybody on September 28 last year, the day of the AFL grand final.

Bashed for asking a passenger to pay his way: A Melbourne bus driver was brutally attacked by a drug-affect teenage passenger on the day of last year's AFL grand final

Causing a commotion: A teenager, in the midst of an ice binge at the time of the attack, violently assaulted a Melbourne bus driver and caused reckless damage to the bus

The boy reportedly failed to tap a valid Myki card - a plastic smartcard ticket used across Victoria's public transport system - when getting on the bus in the west Melbourne suburb of Mill Park with a friend.

The video starts following the bus driver's request for the passenger to get off the bus.

'Are you gonna drive?' the drug-affected boy yells.

'Drive the f***ing bus.'

Despite the physical attack, the bus driver stands firm and demands the boy 'get off'.

'Are you gonna drive?' the boy again asks the driver.

When the driver refuses, the boy slaps him across the face.

After holding the bus driver in a headlock and punching him in the face, the boy's friend finally comes to the front of the bus to try and control the situation.

The male friend, wearing a black pullover with a white 'Everlast' logo, manages to eventually remove his ice raging friend from the bus after reminding him of the young children who were forced to witness the unprovoked attack.

'Mate - there's little kids, there's little kids,' he tells his friend after trying to restrain him from further injuring the driver.

Forced to intervene: The man's friend, clearly concerned by the violence his friend had shown, steps in and helps the driver remove him from the bus

The bus driver, who does not want to be identified, told Nine News Melbourne that he thought the man was going to kill him.

'He just started swearing, throwing punches, grabbing me in the head and just violently attacking me - I've never seen that much rage in a person before,' he said.

'I'm wrecked, he's wrecked my life - I'm scared.'

That sentiment was shared by his sister, Antoinette, who spoke with 3AW Radio's Neil Mitchell on Monday.

She said that despite her brother's injuries - the safety of the passengers were paramount to him.

'All he kept saying in that hospital was: I wanted to protect my passengers,' she said.

Speaking with MailOnline, Bus Association Victoria executive director Chris Lowe said that this attack is part of a broader societal problem, not merely a drug problem.

'Passengers find ticketing systems frustrating and take it out on the bus drivers,' Mr Lowe said.

'A lot of people who abuse bus drivers forget they're being watched on CCTV.'

In an effort to find out why violent attacks against public transport workers are on the rise, Public Transport Victoria has partnered with Monash University to conduct research on the issue.

For this bus driver, the research and future awareness campaigns are coming too late.

According to his family, it's changed his whole personality.

'He became more quieter, more paranoid,' his sister told Neil Mitchell.

'These people don't understand that something like this goes on... it continues and disrupts lives.'

The bus driver has since left his position with Dysons Bus Services, unable to return behind the wheel.

The teenage boy has pled guilty to recklessly causing injury.

He is yet to be sentenced.
