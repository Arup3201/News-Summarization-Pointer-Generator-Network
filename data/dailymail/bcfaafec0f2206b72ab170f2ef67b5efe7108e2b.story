The father of a 12-year-old boy who is accused of stabbing his eight-year-old sister to death at their California home in April has said he doubts his son could have committed the murder.

'I saw [my son’s] demeanor. I saw the two weeks after that. I don’t think he did it,' Barney Fowler told NBC News.

The boy, who pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder charges in May, initially told investigators that a stranger had broken into their Valley Springs home and attacked his sister.

His description of a tall man with long gray hair led to a massive police hunt, before the boy, who cannot be identified because he is a minor, was arrested.

Mr Fowler described the moment he found his daughter bleeding in the house after returning from a Little League game.

'I went in and carried my daughter’s 
body out and was gonna take her to the hospital because I felt she was 
still alive,' he said.

'The little bit I saw that no one else saw, I won’t talk about,' he added. 

The Calaveras County coroner said that Leila died of shock and hemorrhaging caused by multiple stab wounds.

Two weeks after her death, Leila's brother was named as a suspect and Mr Fowler had to turn him in, according to ABC 7.

Mr Fowler's fiancée, Crystal Walters, said: 'The community wants answers. We want answers.'

Tapes of the frantic 911 call she made on the day Leila died were released in May have been released.

She was not home at the time of the attack but placed the call with emergency services.

In a recording she can be heard calling 911 and saying that the children, 
including Leila, were OK.

'My children are at home alone and a man just ran out of our house,' she said in the call on April 27.

'My 
older son was in the bathroom and my daughter started screaming. He came
out and a man was in the house. They said they're OK.'

She added, 'My daughter is freaking out right now.' In fact, Leila was dying of stab wounds.

In May, attorney Mark Reichel admitted the youngster 
might have lied about seeing a long-haired man fleeing the scene, but said that did not make the boy the killer.

Grief: Barney Fowler and his girlfriend Crystal Walters say they want answers

Vigil: Barney Fowler, with his family (including Leila's siblings who are not identified) says he will back his son

He said his client might have made up a 'macho' story about scaring away the intruder because he was scared.

Mr Reichel said that after visiting the boy, he and law partner Steve 
Plesser met the family and toured the hillside home where the 
stabbing took place. Mr Reichel declined to say what they spoke about.

'How does a 12-year-old commit the perfect crime?' said Mr Reichel, whose 
firm was part of a team that two years ago successfully defended members
of the Hmong community, including former Gen. Vang Pao, against charges
they plotted to overthrow the government of Laos.

He declined to comment on the emotional state of the boy or his family, adding: 'They're going through a very difficult time.'

Mr Fowler said in May: 'Until they have
the proper evidence to show it's my son, we're standing behind him. If 
they have the evidence, well that's another story. We're an honest 
family.'

The boy told investigators on April 
27 that he encountered a random attacker in the family home while his 
father was attending a Little League game. He described the man as tall 
with long gray hair.

The boy said the man fled on foot and he found his sister bleeding.

Leila's death set off an intense manhunt in the rural community where some residents had moved to escape big city crime.

The Calaveras County Sheriff's Office spent more than 2,000 man-hours amassing evidence and searching door-to-door.

Residents
of the rural community began locking their doors and calling 
authorities when they thought they saw men who fitted the description.

They also held fundraisers for the Fowler family and turned out by the thousands for a candlelight vigil in Leila's honor.

'We're thankful to the community and all they've done for my daughter,' Mr Fowler said.

He
echoed comments made by his son, Justin Fowler, 19, 
who said the family was in shock and extremely sad about the boy's 
arrest.

Justin said the 
family is 'in a fog' over the boy's arrest that has rocked the 
community of Valley Springs.

The
arrested boy had appeared at a vigil for his sister on April 30, along with 
brother Justin, who was photographed with the name 'Leila' written on 
his forearm.

Police released no information about 
what led them to arrest the unidentified 12-year-old for the April 27 
attack.

A neighbor told detectives she saw a man flee the home 
but she later recanted the story.

Police said there was no sign of a 
burglary or robbery. As part of the investigation, authorities seized 
several knives from the Fowler home, where Leila lived with her father, 
stepmother and siblings.

‘I just want to thank the entire 
community and all of our family and friends for all the overwhelming 
amount of support you've given our family,’ Ms Walters said at a vigil for Leila. 
‘It will never be forgotten. Thank you.’

The April 27 attack on Leila Fowler shook the tightknit Valley Springs community of about 7,400 people and set off a massive manhunt

Calaveras County Deputy Coroner Steve
Moore said the girl died from multiple stab wounds. They have not 
revealed how many times she was stabbed or where.

Violent crime is so rare in the 
community of 7,400 people that even law enforcement officers have to 
stop and think when asked about the last time there was a stranger 
killing in the area.

'Probably five years ago was the last one I can remember,' said Officer 
Rebecca Myers of the California Highway Patrol, who was assigned to 
block access to the neighborhood of one-acre homes.
