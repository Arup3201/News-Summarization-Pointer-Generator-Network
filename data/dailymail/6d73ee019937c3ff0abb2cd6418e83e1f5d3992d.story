Given that the Duchess of Cambridge frequently raids her mother’s wardrobe, perhaps this is Carole Middleton’s way of getting her own back.

The 57-year-old wore an unusual fur headband around her white safety helmet during a family holiday to the upmarket French ski resort of Meribel.

While Kate, 30, and her husband were both sporting rather more mundane black protective headwear, Mrs Middleton’s choice of fluffy accessory made her stand out on the slopes.

Turning heads: In her distinctive headband, Carole sits next to son-in-law Prince William on a ski lift in France

Function over fashion: Kate opted to ski in a rather more mundane black helmet when she took to the slopes

But it seems the fake fur band was originally destined for Kate’s head – and was sent to her by British firm Fosi,  via her parents’ company, after her engagement to Prince William was announced in late 2010.

It was a canny marketing ploy by the Plymouth-based skiwear accessories firm, whose motto is ‘drab to fab in seconds’, as anything Kate wears, from dresses to wellington boots, usually sells out instantly.

It is not clear whether the Duchess, an accomplished skier, ever got to try out the gift, which sells for £29.99. But it certainly found favour with her mother – before finding its way into her suitcase for the recent holiday.

Unusually for a family that prides  itself on its discretion, Mrs Middleton even sent a letter to Fosi’s founder,  Barbara Lees, to thank her for the present.

Handwritten on headed paper sent from the family’s £1.5million home in Bucklebury, Berkshire, it warned Mrs Lees that ‘we’ – presumably meaning Carole and her husband Michael – ‘do not normally accept gifts’. But it went on to describe the ski helmet band as ‘lovely’ and wished Mrs Lees, who set up the company in 2010, success in her venture.

It read: ‘Thank you very much for the helmet headband.

In control: Pippa looked calm and composed as she showed her skills on the slopes

‘We do not normally accept gifts  and would be grateful if you could not send anything else, but I think it’s a lovely product and wish you every success.’

While secretly delighted to have received the letter, Mrs Lees thought nothing more of it until she saw  photographs of Mrs Middleton wearing the ‘Lynx’ headband on a ski lift with the Duke of Cambridge in the  Trois Vallées.

‘I was astonished and couldn’t be happier,’ she told the Mail.

‘We are a new business in a very competitive market so it was a massive boost to Fosi to see her in it. Carole Middleton is a very stylish woman and we think it looks great on her.’

The Middletons wrote a handwritten letter to Mrs Lees thanking her for the fur hat

Mrs Lees, who has skied since  she was a teenager, created  the product after being forced  to wear a helmet when she took  up snowboarding.

‘The main reason I didn’t wear one before was vanity, I suppose,’ she explained.

‘Unless
 you really do look like Kate Middleton, then they really aren’t very 
flattering. I had a lovely collection of fur hats that I used to wear 
and so decided to create something based on them that made the helmet 
look better.

‘The Fosi is 
non-slip and can just be attached around the helmet. It cost me £40,000 
to set the  business up but we have been growing steadily.

‘That
 said, to see Carole Middleton wearing it is such an unbelievable boost 
and just goes to  show that nothing ventured,  nothing gained.’

Designed
 to encourage more women to wear helmets, the  Lynx headband worn by Mrs
 Middleton is one of the firm’s best-selling products.

Should
 she feel so inclined,  the royal in-law could also buy a matching 
helmet tail, scarf, cuff, snood or even faux fur boot toppers to 
complete the look. Unlike members of the royal family, the Middletons do
 not have to declare any gifts given to them.

Kate seemed happy to stick to her own headwear rather than borrow her mother's, while Pippa was also safety-conscious

Time with the in-laws: Prince William skis in

later took in the view as she climbed back to the top of the slope

And their daughter only has to record on the official Royal Gift Register details of items received during the course of her public duties since marrying Prince William last year.

Mr and Mrs Middleton are entrepreneurs themselves and run a hugely successful internet-based firm, Party Pieces, which sells children’s party goods.

The couple have been repeatedly accused of cashing in on their daughter’s association with  the royal family, although sources close to them insist they have  done their best to manage their long-standing business without causing embarrassment to the Duke and Duchess.
