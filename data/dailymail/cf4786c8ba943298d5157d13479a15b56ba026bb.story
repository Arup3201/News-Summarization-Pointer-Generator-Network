It's traditionally seen as the domain of the savvy, style-conscious female shopper. But up and down the country hordes of men piled into stores to do last minute Christmas shopping.

Perfume departments heaved and lingerie stores were full of slightly bemused looking men attempting to pick the perfect outfit.

In central London, three-quarters of those hitting the shops were men, according to a spokesman for the New West End Company, which represents 600 retailers across Oxford Street, Regent Street and Bond Street.

The spokesman said: 'There has been a last-minute surge, although we always knew today would be busy. We're expecting to have had 400,000 people today.

'The lingerie and perfume counters are heaving. One of the Dior counters said they had their first sale just 13 seconds after opening this morning.

'There are also a lot of people at the Marks and Spencer and John Lewis food counters, where people seem to be panic buying.'

He said lots of items were heavily discounted so that stores can clear their shelves for the sales. 'It's definitely been a shopper's market,' he added.

Busy scenes were also reported at Bluewater shopping centre in Kent, where total footfall between December 20 and today was expected to be around 750,000.

A spokeswoman for the centre said there was also a heavy male presence at the site, with the gift wrapping service being particularly popular today.

Shoppers are predicted to blow an incredible £2bn today with 38 per cent of all British adults expected to splash out on last minute gifts and party food.

Yesterday bumper crowds spent a similar amount as they packed into shopping centres across the country with many stores staying open until 11pm to cope with demand.

Analysts claim that 12.44pm, yesterday 
was the busiest shopping minute of the entire year with 57 trolleys per second 
predicted to have been going through checkouts at Morrisons stores 
across the country alone.

Savvy consumers waited for 
stores to start their sales in the final run-up to Christmas and made 33million transactions worth more than £1.5billion 
throughout the day.

It was an increase of around 8 per cent compared with the same period last year which, according to Visa, made it Britain's busiest shopping day ever. 

The rise is partly attributed to 
shoppers being able to enjoy some of the biggest pre-Christmas discounts
ever as desperate stores try to boost sales.

Cash-strapped Britons are expected to splash out £500million more than last year in the post-Christmas sales, researchers claim.

More than half of us are hoping to bag a bargain in the New Year sales, spending an average £92.58 each, according to a study by Sheila's Wheels home insurance.

Clothes, shoes and accessories will be at the top of shopping lists with Britons forking out 79 per cent more on these items than a year ago.

One-in-five of those polled said they plan to spend more in the New Year sales than on their Christmas shopping.

The study estimates £4.8billion will be spent in the January sales this year with the average person buying 15 items in the January sales.

Jacky Brown, of Sheilas' Wheels, said: 'The January sales are getting earlier every year as so many families are eager to grab a bargain rather than fork out a fortune over Christmas.'

Early bird shoppers queued outside 
John Lewis, Hamleys and Marks & Spencer before doors opened this 
morning, keen to beat the crowds.

London's West End was heaving and hectic scenes were reported across Oxford Street, Regent Street and Bond Street.

A spokesman for the New West End 
Company, which represents 600 retailers across the three famous shopping
streets, said it was even busier than anticipated, adding that about 
70 per cent of the shoppers appeared to be men who had left their gift-buying to
the 11th hour.

He said: 'We expect one million shoppers today and tomorrow through the West End stores, spending £100 million in total.'

Many firms have already launched 
their January sales ahead of what are expected to be the two most 
lucrative days of the year on the high street.

Many stores have drafted in thousands of extra staff to help ease the heavy load.

A spokesman for Asda said: 'We're expecting today and tomorrow to be our busiest days of the year. This year we are pulling out all the stops to give our customers an extra 7,000 helping hands.'

Morrisons, meanwhile, claimed it experienced its busiest shopping minute of the year at 12.44pm.

However, the discount deals are already starting to backfire.

Customers who bought early have been angered to find their purchases are now selling for a fraction of the price.

Discount bonanza: The busiest hour of shopping in 2011 was due to take place yesterday between 12pm and 1pm

A report by accountant RSM Tenon 
released yesterday paints a bleak picture of the state of the high 
street. It claims 13 per cent of retailers, around 8,990, are at high 
risk of collapsing into insolvency.

As a result January sales have started early as firms try to lure consumers with the promise of rock-bottom prices.

In
some cases, major chains are discounting by up to 80 per cent. French 
Connection, which issued a profit warning earlier this month, brought 
forward its sale by a week. 

The move comes a week after a Government
commissioned report by self-styled retail guru Mary Portas warned that 
the UK’s high streets were under threat from online competition, with 
some town centres described as ‘dead’.

Latest government figures showed 
sales volumes for November fell 0.4 percent from the previous month, 
according to the Office for National Statistics due to poor sales of 
computers, watches, jewellery and carpets.

More
worrying data released yesterday showed UK shopper numbers for this 
week are lower than the weak snow-affected period last year.

In yet another blow to stores, Boxing
Day sales have been thrown into chaos in the capital after a High Court
judge refused to ban a Tube strike.

Drivers
who have already seen their salaries rocket to more than £50,000 per 
year are walking out demanding £365 overtime pay and a lieu day.

Hundreds of families expecting to 
tuck into a luxury feast this Christmas will be left disappointed after 
Fortnum & Mason admitted many of its famous hampers will not arrive 
in time.

The store blamed 
‘severe’ IT problems as it said that thousands of hampers are still 
sitting in its warehouse, shattering the hopes of present-buyers who 
have shelled out a small fortune for one of the wicker baskets.

It
has promised to provide refunds to those who ordered their hampers in 
good time and still do not receive them by Christmas Eve.
