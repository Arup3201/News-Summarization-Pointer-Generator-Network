Charges: Brandon Abbott, 31, was arrested and charged Thursday in connection with the deaths of his twin sons who died in a house fire

The Indiana father of the three-year-old twins who died in a house fire was arrested and charged in connection with their deaths Thursday. 

Seven months after a house fire resulted in the deaths of his twin sons Liam and Landon, Brandon Abbott, 31, has been charged with two neglect of a dependent charges as well as other drug-related felony charges and two misdemeanors, according to the IndyStar.

An investigation proved that Abbott had firearms in the rented house near Mulberry and was conducting a 'marijuana growing operation' inside the house, according to a probable cause affidavit. 

The affidavit states that officers found a loaded handgun, more than 200 grams of marijuana, as well as a variety of other drugs in the home.

Abbott, a convicted felon, is prohibited from possessing a firearm, Indy reports. 

The cause of the April house fire that resulted in the death of the twins remains unknown. 

Authorities reportedly arrived at the home around 11am that Saturday morning in April, after dispatchers received a call, to find Abbott and Nicole Thomas, 31, on the front lawn of the home with injuries as the house continued to burn. 

Authorities rescued the twins from the burning home after finding one boy on the floor and another on a bed in the downstairs bedroom. Both died shortly after being taken to the hospital as a result of the blaze.

At the time of the fire, Layla Abbott, the boy's mother, knew her estranged husband (Brandon) was to blame. 

Shortly after the death of her two sons, Layla told WTHR that, against her wishes, a judge ordered her to make visitation arrangements for the boys with Brandon, who she knew was not fit to care for them properly.

'He asked for them on Friday and I let him take them and I wish I wouldn't have,' Layla told WTHR just days after the fire. '...I knew they weren't safe with him. I knew something bad was going to happen.'

Layla's intuition has proved to be correct.

Blood tests confirmed that Brandon had marijuana, Ecstasy, and hydrocodone in his system the night of the fire and Thomas tested positive for Ecstasy, marijuana, amphetamine, Hydrocodone, and fentanyl.

Though the cause of the fire remains undetermined, authorities say they discovered an exploded propane canister in a 'black light room' on the first floor of the home.

Abbott told authorities that he used the propane torch to smoke 'dab' -- a slang term used to describe a waxy marijuana extract, Indy reports.

Indy reports that Abbott told authorities that he laid the two boys down to sleep on a sofa in the black light room before going to his own bedroom upstairs where he spent the night with Thomas.

The affidavit stated that Abbott told police at the hospital, where his sons were taken after the fire, that the two boys must have started the fire then hid when he tried to find them. 

In a series of Facebook posts by Abbott back in April, according to Indy, he claimed the fire was caused by the children as a result of his poor housekeeping. 

In another post he detailed the incident saying he tried to put the fire out using a blanket and water before he drove his car through the house's garage door in an attempt to save his children. 

However, an investigation found the car to be covered in soot but otherwise completely in tact with a fresh handprint on the trunk sparking speculations that something may have been hidden. 

Abbott is being held at Tippecanoe County Jail. Each neglect of a dependent charge is punishable by up to 50 years in prison.
