The body of a missing AIG executive, last seen at a Californian hotel on Thursday, was discovered in the nearby desert.

Omar Arce Meza, 33, from Los Angeles, was last seen at around 11pm at the JW Marriott Desert Springs Resort in Palm Desert. 

The cause of death is still unknown.

Investigation: Police divers had searched the pond at the Marriott Hotel in Palm Desert (pictured) but to no avail, though they have found Mr Meza's jacket and wallet on the golf course

Mystery: Mr Meza was last seen on Thursday at the luxury Marriott resort in California

 'We are with heavy hearts tonight as we announce the passing of Omar Meza. He was a very loved son, husband, brother & friend. We would like to take this time to grieve his passing and ask that everyone please respect our privacy at this time,' said his family in a Facebook statement.

'We would like to thank all of the supporters this past week. It brings tears to our eyes to see how well loved Omar was, he will be missed by many.' 

His wife Diane described how she spoke to him at around 11.20pm on January 8. He told her that he would call her from his hotel room to say goodnight.

Diane, who had been married to Mr Meza for five years, told The Los Angeles Times: ‘I never got that call, and I already fell asleep.’

She said the fact that he didn’t call didn’t unduly alarm her.

Diane, along with family and friends, had set up a Facebook page containing photographs and information about Mr Meza to aid the search effort.

Meza, a vice president for AIG Financial Distributors, had business meetings scheduled for Friday that he didn’t show up for.

Baffling: Meza was last seen walking out of the JW Marriott Desert Springs Resort wearing gray pants and a white T-shirt

Mr Meza has short term memory loss caused by a traffic accident last year - but it's not known if that is linked to his disappearance

He hadn’t used his credit card since Thursday and CCTV footage showed him exiting the hotel on foot wearing gray pants and a white T-shirt, and walking near a parking lot before moving out of shot.

The ‘Find Omar’ Facebook page says that he may have been disorientated.

He suffered from short-term memory loss, caused by a road traffic accident, but it’s not known if this is a factor in his disappearance.

Diane told Kesq.com: 'I'm holding onto that he suffered trauma and doesn't know who he is.'  

Worry: Diane (left) wonders if her husband has suffered some sort of trauma and doesn't know who he is
