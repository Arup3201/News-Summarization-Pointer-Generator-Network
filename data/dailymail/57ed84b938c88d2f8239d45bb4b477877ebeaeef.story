John Terry wants a new era of success at Chelsea

Chelsea are back where the story began, although 10 years ago Wembley was still a hard-hat area and Tottenham and an 11-year-old Harry Kane were only starting to get to know each other.

John Terry and Didier Drogba will never underestimate the significance of that League Cup win in Cardiff in 2005, when Mateja Kezman scrambled the winner and Jose Mourinho told Liverpool’s fans to shush.

‘It set us on our way,’ said Terry, as he recalls his first trophy as captain, the first with Mourinho as manager and Roman Abramovich as owner. ‘It gave us all a taste of what we wanted and we wanted more. It brought us closer together.’

Two months later, Chelsea clinched their first league title for half a century and have barely stopped winning since.

If they beat Tottenham in Sunday's Capital One Cup final, it will be a dozen major prizes in a decade. The 21-month wait since the last one already represents quite a drought in Abramovich terms.

It would also be the launch pad for a second Mourinho era and a first Chelsea trophy for recent signings Nemanja Matic, Cesc Fabregas, Juan Cuadrado, Filipe Luis, Thibaut Courtois and Diego Costa.

And Eden Hazard was at the club when they won the Europa League in 2013 but did not play in the final, which means the bulk of the team has yet to experience winning something together.

‘We have got to go out and win trophies to put us right up there,’ said Terry. ‘This could be the first one for a few of the new players. It has been a couple of years since we won anything and it is an important competition. It means a lot to this club.

‘People write this competition off but the manager takes it really seriously and made it clear from the outset when we were away to the smaller clubs that we were in it to win it.

‘You can see that by the teams we’ve put out all the way through and the next step is to go and win it. For me, it’s huge. We look back on that 2004-05 season and it had a huge impact on our confidence and momentum.’

Ten years ago, Mourinho injected a winning mentality into a group of ambitious footballers hungry for success.

‘Like everyone, I felt something different,’ said Terry. ‘That was clear from day one, and it rippled through the whole club. He has brought that back this time.’

Drogba, like Mourinho, has returned and is preparing for Wembley as his 37th birthday looms, aware this trophy is equally as important as it was in his first season at the club.

‘That gave us a big boost,’ said the Ivorian. ‘To know we could win something together if we all focused and really wanted to achieve something special was a big step for us. And winning it again would be a big step for this generation of players.’

Chelsea have lost only once in seven domestic cup finals since Abramovich took control. The single defeat was against Spurs in this competition and at this venue in 2008.

‘It was a real disappointment,’ said Terry. ‘But you move on. We’ve won major trophies since. Sometimes it can have a positive impact because you don’t want to relive those bad memories.’

Of more concern for Mourinho’s team may be the 5-3 defeat by Tottenham two months ago.

‘Everyone is rattling on about that,’ Terry added. ‘But for me it was fairly comfortable for us at the Bridge when we won 3-0 (in December).

‘You get beat through the season. It’s not our only defeat. I don’t see it as a revenge thing.

Didier Drogba agrees that winning on Sunday will provide incentive for the next generation of Chelsea stars

‘They are here to win it. They have come a long way through the competition and some tough games. We are here to win it and we have the squad to win it if we play well. But if we are not at our best and Tottenham are, we have seen they are very good.’

As for Kane, who scored two of the five at White Hart Lane on New Year’s Day, Terry added: ‘He is a very good player, his movement is fantastic and he’s in great goal-scoring form. There’s a lot of quality throughout their squad.

‘I’m surprised they’re not higher in the league. They probably deserve to be higher. They’re a really good squad and they’ll only get better. You can’t single Harry Kane out. There’s a long way to go. He’s got to do it year after year. For England’s sake I hope he does.’
