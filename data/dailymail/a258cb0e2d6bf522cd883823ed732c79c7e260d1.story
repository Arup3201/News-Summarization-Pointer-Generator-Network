It was undoubtedly the most engaging weekend of the Premier League season so far and the 40 goals to fly in came within a whisker of breaking records.

Defenders seemingly under little pressure - most notably Sunderland's Santiago Vergini - thrashed through their own net to aid already swashbuckling attacking oppositions up and down the country. Rather cruelly, it was a sight to behold. 

An average of four goals-a-game was just three short of the most scored during a 10-fixture set in the 20-team era.

Saints were helped on their way enormously by the barbaric own goal of Black Cat Santiago Vergini 

The weekend was three goals shy of February 2011's 43-goal record (as Cheick Tiote scored vs Arsenal)

Louis Saha heads home as Everton beat newly-promoted Blackpool 5-3 at Goodison Park on February 5, 2011

Matchday 8 - 40 goals

Matchday 7 - 27 goals

Matchday 6 - 26 goals

Matchday 5 - 32 goals

Matchday 4 - 30 goals

Matchday 3 - 32 goals 

Matchday 2 - 23 goals 

Matchday 1 - 26 goals 

That came in February 2011, with Everton, Arsenal, Newcastle and Wigan all scoring four goals or more on the Saturday as the weekend totalled an astonishing 43. 

The Toffees knocked five past gung-ho Blackpool after coming back from 3-1 down at Goodison Park.

Events at St James' Park were even more surreal as the Gunners - home and dry four goals to the good at the break - somehow conspired to only leave the North East with a point. 

Cheick Tiote rifled in a stunning 87th minute equaliser to finish one of the most dramatic afternoons in British football.

Roberto Martinez's Wigan had got in on the act, edging a seven-goal thriller with James McCarthy netting twice from midfield. 

The clashes on that weekend - February 5/6 - were far closer than some of the thumpings handed out this time.

Southampton dazzled as much as Sunderland were dismal at St Mary's - Graziano Pelle notching two as Dusan Tadic pulled the strings for Ronald Koeman's side. 

Helped drastically by Vergini's moment of madness and Liam Brudcutt's bundled own goal, of course, but Saints offered reasons to believe they are capable of continuing their early promise. 

Four-goal Sergio Aguero had earlier swept Tottenham aside at the Etihad Stadium in the 4-1 win while Everton comfortably beat Aston Villa 3-0. Taking into consideration what had preceded it, the four swings in the final moments at Loftus Road as Liverpool somehow overcame QPR was as predictable as it was stunning. 

It meant - when taking Sunday's matches into consideration - that there were eight more nets bulging than any other matchday this campaign.
