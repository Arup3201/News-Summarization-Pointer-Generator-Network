Two French journalists have been killed hours after being kidnapped by suspected Al-Qaeda rebels in Mali.

French president Francois Hollande has condemned the killing of Ghislaine Dupont, 51, and Claude Verlon, 58, who were covering elections in the volatile African state.

Four gunmen struck at 1pm today in the northern town of Kidal, where the pair were seen being beaten before they were driven away in a 4x4 pickup truck.

Both had been interviewing Ambeiry Ag Rhissa, from the Tuareg separatist group MNLA, on behalf of Radio France International (RFI) and were kidnapped outside his house.

One source said their bodies were found riddled with bullets eight miles from the town, which was the birthplace of a violent uprising last year.

Another source said the pair's throats may have been cut.

Mr Rhissa said: 
'When they left, I heard a strange noise outside. I immediately went out
 to see and when I opened my door, a turbaned man pointed a gun at me 
and told me go back inside.

'I could not see how many men were there.'

They had travelled to the town despite being warned not to by the French army, a defence official said.

French president Francois Hollande has condemned the killing, saying in a statement: 'The French president ... expresses his indignation over this heinous act.'

Dupont
 was a journalist 'passionate about her job and the African continent 
that she covered since joining RFI in 1986,' bosses at her radio station
 said in a statement.

Verlon was 'used to difficult terrain throughout the world,' it added, and staff members 'are all in shock, profoundly saddened, indignant and angry'.

France opened a judicial investigation into the kidnappings and deaths 'linked to a terrorist enterprise,' the prosecutor's office said.

The French Foreign Ministry said intelligence services are joining with Malian authorities to shed light on the circumstances of their deaths.

‘The kidnappers were driving a Toyota pick-up,’ said local governor Adama Kamissoko, who added that all were heavily armed.

French forces intervened in Mali in January against an Al Qaeda rebel army which President Francois Hollande feared was trying to take over the country.

Although the force was initially 
repelled, the extremists have regrouped, and intense fighting is still 
taking place around the country.

Last week four Frenchmen held captive by Al Qaeda terrorists for more than three years arrived back in Paris.

Pierre Legrand, 28, Thierry Dol, 32, Daniel Larribe, 62, and Marc Feret, 46 were all captured in September 2010 during raids on a uranium mine near Arlit, northern Niger, where they were working for nuclear giant Areva.

The Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) group claimed responsibility and there were always fears that the hostages would be killed.

There have been claims since then that France paid more than £17m for the hostage release, although Mr Hollande vehemently denied this, insisting that his country does not negotiate with Al-Qaeda.

Mr Hollande launched air strikes and sent hundreds of soldiers into Mali in January to drive back Al Qaeda rebels, saying they would use the West African country as a base for attacks on the west.

The global intelligence company Stratfor estimates that al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM, has carried out at least 18 kidnappings since 2003, raising an estimated $89m in ransom payments.

There was no initial comment today from the journalists’ employer, RFI.
