John Swift and Kwame Thomas were on target as England's under 20s beat the United States at Plymouth to record their second win of the week.

Having overcome a talented Mexico side on penalties on Wednesday night, Aidy Boothroyd's Young Lions defied horrendous conditions and stubborn opposition to earn another morale-boosting victory ahead of the summer's Toulon Tournament.

The result, in front of a large crowd of over 11,000 at Home Park, extended Boothroyd's unbeaten start as England under 20s manager.

He made extensive changes from the side that beat Mexico, with Brentford right-back Moses Odubajo the only surviving player of the team.

With gale-force winds and torrential rain greeting England on their first visit to the Devon city in 26 years, it took both sides some time to get into their stride.

Gradually Swift, the Chelsea midfielder currently on loan at Swindon Town in League One, began to take control of the midfield and he forced a fingertip save from American goalkeeper Jeff Caldwell.

The States were happy to play on the counter-attack and Sunderland goalkeeper Jordan Pickford had to be alert to deny Maki Tall.

Most of the crowd thought England had taken the lead when Leeds United's Alex Mowatt sent a left-footed shot towards goal, but it had actually found the side-netting.

But England's reward would arrive on the stroke of half-time and it was fitting that Swift should provide the breakthrough.

Obubajo advanced down the right and looked up to see Swift lurking on the edge of the area. Taking one touch to control, he fired past Caldwell to split the teams at half-time.

The Young Lions continued to boss the game after the break and Mowatt went close again, firing over when Norwich City defender Harry Toffolo found him well-placed inside the box.

A second goal duly arrived on 68 minutes - Swift sprung up on the left-wing, beat his man and crossed from the byline to Thomas.

The Derby County forward fired home to score what proved to be the winning goal.

But the States ensured a nervy finale when Tall pulled one back with 11 minutes to play, and they appeared to be level when Boxi Yomba scored late on. The eagle-eyed referee, however, spotted that Yomba had guided the ball in with his hand.
