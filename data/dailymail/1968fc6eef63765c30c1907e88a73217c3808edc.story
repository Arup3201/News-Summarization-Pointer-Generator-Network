A star of Channel 4's Shameless must pay vast damages to a trainee plumber he left brain-damaged after hurling him from the bonnet of his BMW, the High Court ruled today.

Elliott Tittensor crumpled on a court bench in tears today as he lost a case for up to £300,000 - which he will have to pay out of his own pocket because he had no car insurance.

The claim was brought by trainee plumber Oliver Flint, who was just 18 when he was blinded in one eye and given severe head injuries during the late-night row outside a McDonald's in 2010.

A judge heard the argument began with the actor refusing to let Mr Flint use his phone - and led to him splitting with his then-girlfriend, Skins star Kaya Scodelario, three years later.

Now 25, Mr Tittensor said the trainee plumber drunkenly harassed Ms Scodelario and jumped on his bonnet, forcing him to drive off in self-defence.

But Mr Justice Edis ruled in the plumber's favour, telling the High Court: 'The decision to which I have come is that Mr Flint succeeds in his claim against Mr Tittensor for battery'. 

Although he was cautioned and interviewed on suspicion of attempted murder, Mr Tittensor's only criminal conviction in court was to be fined £750 for driving without insurance, the court heard.

Mr Flint, now 22, insisted that Mr Tittensor caused his head injuries outside the restaurant in Kentish Town, north London, which prompted a permanent personality change.

Today’s decision guarantees Mr Flint substantial compensation, though the value of his payout has not yet been decided.

Mr Justice Edis will give detailed reasons for his decision at a later date. 

Evidence: Actor Mr Tittensor arrives at the High Court to give his side of the story yesterday

Earlier Mr Tittensor wept in court as his Skins star ex-girlfriend described the end of their relationship.

Kaya Scodelario paused work on the next Pirates of the Caribbean film to support her ex of five years in the High Court. 

 Ms Scodelario, who rose to fame playing Effy Stonem in Skins, appeared via video link from Australia, where she is filming Pirates of the Caribbean 5, to support her ex-boyfriend in court.

The pair were dating at the time and Ms Scodelario was left abandoned in the McDonald's when her actor boyfriend 'fled the scene'.

She has told the court that what happened that night led to her and Mr Tittensor breaking up in 2013. She is now engaged to actor Benjamin Walker.

Dressed in a loose, white, scoop-necked blouse, she told Mr Justice Edis: 'Elliott is a very kind human being.

'We were boyfriend and girlfriend for five and a half years. He is an extremely gentle person.

'He is incredibly kind to his family and they are a wonderful family who welcomed me in'. 

Telling the judge about the end of their relationship and its aftermath, she added: 'We continue to have a very civil, warm communication with each other.

'That cannot be said of most couples who are not together any more, and that says a lot about his character.' 

Mr Tittensor wiped away tears as his ex-girlfriend spoke, his face crumpling with emotion as he watched her on the screen.

Telling the judge about the incident, she said that when she next saw her ex-boyfriend at her north London flat, his first thoughts were for her and the badly injured Mr Flint.

'Elliott was immediately concerned for Oliver's well being,' she said. 'I have never seen him be aggressive to anyone.

'He was very shaken up and frightened, and above all concerned for me that I had been attacked.

'I could see he was panicked about whether Oliver was okay, after falling off the bonnet of the car, because he couldn't see and didn't know what state he was in.'

She also told the judge that she had bumped into Mr Flint, who lives in the same area of north London in which she grew up, twice in nightclubs since the incident.

She said that Mr Flint was 'not aggressive' on either of those occasions, but that she 'asked the people he was with if he was going to attack me'.

She added: 'I said I didn't want to be attacked, or my friends or family to be attacked.

'He said we ruined his chance of being on Big Brother, on Channel Four, and he was devastated about that.'

Mr Tittensor, who played Carl Gallagher in Shameless, previously described the trainee plumber as 'harassing'  his then-girlfriend before the alleged attack.

She told the judge: 'I felt him following me, which is something I find intimidating, and he was very loud and aggressive.

Scene: The incident happened nearly five years ago outside this McDonald's in Kentish Town, north London

'I was an 18-year-old girl on her own being followed by a large man, shouting. It was very traumatic and dramatic for me.'

Asked by Andrew Roy, for Mr Flint, how she would have expected Mr Tittensor to react to a perceived threat or harassment towards her, she said: 'Obviously, with the job we chose, we gave up part of our right to defend ourselves.

'We are both very intelligent and very mature and we both think it is better to take the high ground and ignore incidents and not make eye contact.' 

The screen couple dated five and a half years and Ms Scodelario has starred in The Maze Runner. 

Mr Flint, 22, of Archway, north London, is accusing Mr Tittensor of 'trespass against the person' by manoeuvring his car in a way which threw him from the bonnet.

Mr Tittensor, from Heywood, Lancashire, insists that he was in fear of Mr Flint - who the actor described as 'a drunk, crazy person trying to beat through my windscreen'.

He says that he acted entirely reasonably in self defence. 

Mr Tittensor earlier told the judge: 'I had what appeared to be a drunk, crazy person trying to beat through my windscreen and attack me.

'It looked like he was trying to do his best to do that. I've just tried to be as honest as possible. I felt like he was trying to kill me.'

'I've never been in a situation like that before in my entire life.'

The High Court hearing continues.
