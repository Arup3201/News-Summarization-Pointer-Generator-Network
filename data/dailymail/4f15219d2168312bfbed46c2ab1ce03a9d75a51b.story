Ian Holloway believes that Steve Parish's passionate support of Crystal Palace could be holding the club back.

He acknowledged that Parish loves the Eagles but believes that there is a fine line between being a fan and a chairman. 

Holloway told The Mirror: 'I couldn't help but think to myself that having such a passionate fan as Steve as chairman is part of the problem.'

'Sometimes what a fan expects and what a chairman can practically deliver are two completely different things. When your heart rules your head in football then you have problems.

The Millwall boss did though state that the fans should be told why Tony Pulis left Palace, after failed emergency talks resulted in the Welshman leaving Selhurst by mutual consent.

He added: 'By the very nature of his departure the relationship between manager and club had irretrievably broken down. Palace fans deserve an explanation.'
