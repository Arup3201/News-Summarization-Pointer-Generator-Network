Hospitals will become ‘warehouses of older people’ without major changes in the National Health Service, Labour claimed today.

Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham warned up to 40 per cent of hospital beds are taken by older people and the ageing population will mean the problem will only get worse.

He called for the NHS, social care and mental health services to be merged to stop elderly people being put on a ‘fast track to care homes’.

Mr Burnham said that as people get older their needs become a ‘blur of the physical, mental and social’ and health spending should be combined into a single £119 billion budget.

Ministers including Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and PM David Cameron have blamed poor standards of nursing for problems on wards.

But Mr Burnham says the NHS has failed to adapt to the increasingly old patients it treats. Councils, qwhich are currently responsible for adult social care, are under pressure to keep council tax down so have ‘whittled away’ services.

‘It's financial madness, as well as being
bad for people,’ Mr Burnham said in a speech to the King’s Fund as he 
launched a Labour policy review of health and social care.

‘Hospital chief executives tell me that, on any given day, around 30 per cent to 40 per cent of beds are occupied by older people who needn't have been there.

If we leave things as they are, our district general hospitals will be like warehouses of older people - lined up on the wards because we failed to do something better for them.

‘But it gets worse. Once they are there, they go downhill for lack of whole-person support and end up on a fast-track to care homes - costing them and us even more.

‘We could get much better results for people, and much more for the £104 billion we spend on the NHS and the £15 billion on social care, but only if we turn this system on its head.

‘We need incentives in the right place - keeping at home and out of hospitals.’

He claimed hospitals operate a 'a 20th century production-line model' which treats immediate problems like broken bones or the impact of a stroke without considering the 'whole person'.

Staff in hospitals who used to rarely see a patient over the age of 80 have not changed to deal with ever greater numbers of very frail people in their 80s and 90s, with intensive physical, mental and social care needs.

Mr Burnham spoke of his distress in 2007 at being unable to fulfil a promise to his sister-in-law, who had breast cancer, that she would be able to die at home.

'I told her I thought I would be able to. But, after a day of phone calls, I will never forget having to going back to Claire and say it couldn’t be done.

'And I was a minister who knew how the system worked, so what chance have families who are at a low ebb and don’t know where to start?'

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: 'The public will rightly be concerned that, despite their promises, Labour plan a massive restructuring of the NHS which takes power away from the doctors and nurses who know their patients best and puts it in the hands of local politicians.

'I welcome the fact that Labour have finally recognised the importance of integrated care, but they had 13 years to achieve this and failed to do so. In fact, the system they left was fragmented and focused on treating patients as a collection of conditions not as individuals.

'In the last two years we have put patients at the heart of the NHS by allowing GPs, who understand the sometimes complex conditions of their patients, to commission services to meet their personal needs.'Chris Ham, chief executive of The King's Fund think tank, said: 'The demands of an ageing population, changing burden of disease and rising patient expectations mean that fundamental change is needed.'

He said Mr Burnham's plans were 'ambitious' but leaves 'a number of unanswered questions'
