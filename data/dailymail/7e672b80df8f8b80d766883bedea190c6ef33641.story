A retired architect has put his skills to work making a spectacular treehouse for lucky children in Terrell, Texas.

James Curvan now spends his time building elaborate play areas for his friends' children and this one is truly a work of art.

More like a mini-mansion than a treehouse, Curvan let his imagination run riot to create a complex building with a walkway, stairs, a ladder and a slide as possible options for getting in and out.

Mansion: James Curvan's play houses have different rooms and levels to explore

The interior is no less deluxe and well-thought out.

The children can admire the scaled down fireplace, the wallpaper, telephone and pint-sized wooden furniture that make the treehouse so cosy.Â 

For warm weather, there is a table and chair set on the balcony or a separate shaded platform in the other tree, reached by a treetop walkway.

The more adventurous children can also play on the built-in climbing wall and zipwire all in their own back garden.

Fairytale house: James Curvan spent his career building shops and houses but now he is letting imagination take over as a treehouse designer

Painstaking: It has serious attention to detail with street lights, window boxes and scaled-down topiary

Dog house: Not to be left out, even the family pet has his own luxury pad

Even the dog has been well catered for, with a small wooden kennel tucked in between the street lamp and the window boxes.

However demanding children are these days, surely anyone would be impressed by this in their back garden.

Rather than the standard draughty room with makeshift furniture, this is a treehouse that means business.

Using his architecture degree from The University of Texas at Austin, Curvan has built more conventional shops and homes in the past, but now he gets to be a little more creative.

Dream house: Curvan says that he listens to exactly what the children want and then designs the details from there

James Curvan told County Line magazine that the key to his success was listening to the ideas of the children themselves.

He said: 'They like certain colors, certain animals, and other things. I listen to what they want and then design from that.'After he has listened to the parents over the budget, he makes a scaled-down version of the finished product.

Construction: The playhouse as a work in progress

The finished article: The treehouse looks deluxe and inviting from every angle

When he shows the children a model of their future treehouse, he says that 'their eyes pop open'.The intricate design looks no less impressive at night when the chimney, gable ends and balconies can all be seen clearly by the fairy lights.

Curvan also does stage planning and set design.
