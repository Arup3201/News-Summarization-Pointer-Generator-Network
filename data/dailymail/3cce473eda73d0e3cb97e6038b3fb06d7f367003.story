Muslim community leaders have blasted a Perth preacher's 'offensive' remarks about the Paris massacre.

Prominent Islamic community spokesman Keysar Trad has contacted Mohammed Junaid Thorne's mother in a bid to explain that 'his comments are not helpful'.

Just hours after gunmen killed 12 people at the offices of satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, Thorne, in his mid 20s, declared that insults to the Prophet Mohammed are 'not allowed' and 'very likely to stimulate some kind of response'. 

'I'm very disappointed to see his comments,' Mr Trad told Daily Mail Australia. 'I've sent a message to his mum to hopefully have a chat to him and explain that his comments are not helpful.

'My message to her was to get a word to him to ask him what is he trying to achieve. 'It's so counterproductive and offensive to the families.'

Thorne also said the victims of this week's killings had failed to 'learn the lesson' of the firebombing of their offices in 2011. 

'When you provoke an enormous number of people, or degrade the followers of a religion by insulting something or someone they hold sacred, don't expect to be left alone,' he wrote on Facebook on Thursday. 

Thorne moved to Saudi Arabia with his brother Shayden and his father, an Indigenous man of the Noongar clan, when he was nine-years-old.

His father found a job in the country after divorcing Thorne's mother, a Malaysian Muslim who lives in Perth. 

Growing up in the devout family, Thorne claims he could recite the Koran by the age of six. However, life in Saudi Arabia was not without difficulty.

His brother was imprisoned for allegedly possessing terrorism-related material on a lap top, according to reports, and remained imprisoned for two-and-a-half years when he was granted clemency. Junaid was deported to Australia after protesting his detention in 2012.

After returning to Australia, Thorne began to tour the country, delivering lectures about Islam in front of the flag of a little known radical group known as Millatu Ibrahim, which is banned in Germany.

He also delivered talks about how to 'exorcise jinn' - or genies - which he said are affecting people across the country.  

Over the past six months, the self-styled sheikh has become a controversial figure. 

He branded Australian authorities 'the real terrorists' after police swooped on properties across in Sydney in September.  

He has been outspoken in defence of some of his associates and supporters, including terror suspects Abdul Numan Haider, 18, and Sulayman Khalid, 20.

Counter-terrorism researcher Anne Aly, from Curtin University, told Daily Mail Australia: 'There's a group of young men - Junaid Thorne is one of them - they have a certain world view, a certain opinion about all this.

'They hang around together... He's in that purple circle, if you like.'  

Firebrand Perth preacher Junaid Thorne, who has called Australian authorities 'the real terrorists' in the past, made controversial remarks on Twitter on Thursday

Haider, who once attended a Thorne at the Al Furqan Centre in Melbourne, was gunned down after he allegedly stabbed two police officers outside a Melbourne police station in September.

Thorne was quick to leap to the defence of his 'wonderful, practising brother', who he claimed had been 'murdered' by authorities. 

Daily Mail Australia photographed Thorne attending court with Khalid in October. 

He was charged in December with possessing documents that would allegedly facilitate a terrorist attack, which Thorne described on Facebook as 'a few incomplete sentences'. 

Thorne has said the Islamic State terror group does not have his full support. 

In an interview with the ABC in October, he told an interviewer: 'If I were to vocalise my complete support to them [Islamic State], I would get in trouble.'

'If I was to say that [I] don't support them at all, that would be untrue.

'I may support them [on] certain issues, while I disagree with them in other issues.'

Preaching: Junaid Thorne does not describe himself as an Islamic State supporter. He told the ABC last year: 'I may support them [on] certain issues, while I disagree with them in other issues.'

Lectures: Thorne told the ABC that younger Muslims often felt more comfortable receiving spiritual advice from him instead of elder figures
