A bus driver has been jailed after he was caught four times over the drink-drive limit - at 11am in the morning.

Witnesses noticed something was amiss when they saw Justin Snodin zigzagging towards a bus stop on the wrong side of the road on his route between Louth and Horncastle, in Lincolnshire.

On a number of occasions, he even mounted the grassy verge as he sped through the winding country roads.

The 40-year-old was so drunk that morning that witnesses thought he must be sick, until he stumbled off the bus to smoke a cigarette.

Callum Simons was so concerned that he tailed the 28-seater vehicle in a car on the 15-mile route and called the police.

He then approached Snodin when he came off the bus and asked if he was ok.

Mr Simons later told police 'I asked him why he was swerving all over the road but he was unable to give a coherent reason.'

'We followed the bus. For much of the 
time it was on the wrong side of the road, mounting the grass verge and 
travelling at high speeds on narrow roads.'

Jim Clare, prosecuting, told Skegness 
Magistrates 'The bus was being driven erratically and continually 
mounting the grass verge. A witness thought the driver must be ill.'

Mr Clare told the court that police arrested Snodin after he stopped in Horncastle but his one female passenger became aggressive.

'She was shouting and swearing. It was necessary for the officers to restrain her and that lady was arrested for being drunk and disorderly.'

Snodin was taken to Skegness Police Station where a breath test showed he had 136 mgs of alcohol per 100 mls of breath making him almost four times the legal limit of 35 mgs.

Mr Clare said 'When he was interviewed he explained he had been drinking the night before but had finished at midnight.

'He didn’t believe he was over the limit and felt he was ok to drive. He did admitted he was a recovering alcoholic.'

Snodin was suspended by his employers and later sacked.

The 49-year-old woman passenger arrested was later issued with a police caution for being drunk and disorderly and for possession of cannabis.  

Snodin ,40, of Newmarket, Louth, admitted driving with excess alcohol on 17 March. He was given a 26 week jail sentence suspended for 12 months and banned from driving for three years. Snodin was also ordered to pay £85 prosecution costs.

Terry Boston, defending, said: 'His life has been devastated by this. He has lost his job and is living on benefits.

'He is not a criminal who is continually causing problems. He is a man who has got to his 40s and has no previous convictions of any kind. He has a clean driving licence.

'He had an enormous amount of alcohol in his body. Someone who had that level of alcohol and did not realise it he has got to be ill. There can be no other explanation.'

Mr Boston said that since his arrest Snodin has been receiving treatment for his drink problem.
