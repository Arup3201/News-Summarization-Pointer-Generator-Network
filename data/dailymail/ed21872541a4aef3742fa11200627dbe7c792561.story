Beggars at a religious folk festival in southern China have been ordered to stay in purposely built cages, or be removed from the festivities.

Organisers gave the beggars an ultimatum saying their presence ruins the experience for visitors at the temple fair in Nanchang, Jiangxi province and if they wished to beg they had to do so from inside small cages.

The zoo-like cages are so small adults are unable to stand and although they are free to leave at will, they are immediately banished from the festival area and have to leave the town if they do so.

Caged: Visitors to the town fair in Nanchang, Jiangxi province walk past beggars in cages where they have been forced to stay so as not to spoil the experience for tourists

The annual fair celebrates a religious holy 
day with a funfair, market and entertainment as pilgrims come to the temple from all over China.

Due to the thousands of visitors it has become a magnet for down-and-outs looking for charity from tourists.

‘This year we decided we would no 
longer accept beggars wandering everywhere, distressing our guests and 
spoiling it for everyone else,' explained one organiser before adding that no one is forcing them to beg and that they have voluntarily entered the cages.

‘Over the last few years we have had 
increasing numbers of beggars turning up at the festival and it was 
becoming very intruding for our visitors. They were being harassed and 
made to feel uncomfortable.

‘We had no choice but to ban them from
 the grounds. We found the cages a good solution for everyone. People 
can still give them donations if they desire too but are not harassed 
and followed around the festival when they are having a day out with 
their families.

‘The beggars are quite comfortable in 
their cages, people send them food and water as gifts. In a way it is 
better for them there than having to find a place on the busy streets.'

'Human zoo': The cages are so small the 'inmates' are unable to stand and their conditions have outraged human rights campaigners in China who accuses the festival of keeping a 'human zoo'

‘Our guests come here to enjoy themselves and that is our top priority.

‘The beggars can leave whenever they like but they have to leave the city too, they can't go into the fair,’ they added.

The cages have infuriated human rights campaigners in China who have branded them a human zoo saying it breaches human rights.

‘They are treating them like zoo animals. What will they have to do next - tricks for their food?,' one said. 'This is 
nothing less than public humiliation.'

‘Do they want people to believe the 
region has no poor people and just put on a good show? These people need
 help. We should not be allowing them to be locked away in cages. These 
people are human beings too.'

Locked or banned: The festival organisers have said the beggars are free to leave their cages at any time, but if they do they also have to leave the city and the fair immediately

Many pilgrims who had some to enjoy the fair, but most importantly honour the religious holiday, were outraged by the treatment of the beggars.

Lu Cheng who was visiting the temple 
with his family said: ‘I was horrified to see these poor people in 
cages. We came for a nice day out with the family, but it was 
distressing to see fellow humans kept like animals in a cage.

‘These people deserve better treatment
 and should be able to visit the festival just like everyone else. If 
people decide to give them food, money or water that is up to them.'

Traditionally people visited the temple to pay their sacrifices to Buddhist gods.

Thousands of people from many 
different provinces make the pilgrimage to the temples and due to its 
popularity the nearby town has turned the event into a fair with folk 
shows, traditional foods, markets with local delicacies and attractions 
for children.
