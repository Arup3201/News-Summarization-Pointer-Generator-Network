Celebratory drink: Michael Le Vell plans to sue the Crown Prosecution Service to reclaim almost £200,000 in legal costs spent clearing his name

Innocent Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell plans to sue the Crown Prosecution Service to reclaim his huge legal costs, after the battle to clear his name left him almost £200,000 out of pocket.

The star, real name Michael Turner, fell victim to changes in Ministry of Justice rules made in 2011 which removed the right of defendants to have the ‘reasonable’ costs of hiring a lawyer reimbursed if they are found not guilty.

The 48-year-old was accused of raping and sexually assaulting a teenage girl but was cleared by a jury last week in under five hours.

And now the TV star hopes to reclaim the enormous legal costs amid questions over whether the case should ever have been brought to trial in the first place.

A friend of the actor said he planned to ‘fight’ for justice after two years of hell, adding: ‘Mike and his entire family have suffered – not just mentally but financially throughout this farcical trial.

‘It is not just the substantial legal fees to worry about – there is also the damaging effect the trial will have on him for the rest of his life and career.

‘There have been early discussions between him and his legal counsel and they have agreed that they have not finished working together.’

And another TV insider stressed that while soap actors are ‘reasonably well paid’, they are not as wealthy as many would believe.

The source added: ‘The estimates about what TV actors get paid for appearing in soaps are usually hugely exaggerated.

'Of course they are on comfortable salaries, but not enough to fund something like this.’

The case against the actor was initially dropped by the CPS in January 2012 due to a lack of evidence, after he was arrested in September 2011.

But on February 14 this year Alison Levitt QC, principal legal adviser to the Director of Public Prosecutions, announced that she had reviewed the decision and authorised Greater Manchester Police to charge Le Vell.

Out of pocket: The star fell victim to changes in Ministry of Justice rules made in 2011 which removed the right of defendants to have the 'reasonable' costs of hiring a lawyer reimbursed if they are found not guilty

An insider at the Ministry of Justice admitted it would be possible for the actor to bring a case against the CPS, explaining: ‘It depends on the individual circumstances of a case, but it is certainly a possibility.

‘The rules were changed in 2011 to prevent the taxpayer footing large bills for those who can afford to pay for their own defence. 

‘Legal aid is means tested and the vast majority of cases in crown courts are funded that way.’

The trial has also seen many members of Mr Le Vell’s family incur huge travel costs – some of them flying over from Australia to support him as he faced 12 charges at Manchester Crown Court.
