A husband has described the heartbreaking moment he was forced to switch off his wife's life support machine after she died giving birth.

Caroline Howarth, who suffered several health complications throughout her life, had defied the odds to become pregnant and was overjoyed when she found out she was expecting a baby girl.

But just before she was about to give birth the 24-year-old suffered an asthma attack, which caused her heart to stop.

Caroline Howarth never got to meet her baby daughter Haillie-Rose (with father Lee) after she suffered a heart attack just before giving birth

Mrs Howarth, from Pontypool, South Wales, suffered oxygen starvation during the heart attack in May.

Doctors carried out an emergency Caesarean to deliver her daughter, Haillie-Rose, but her mother never regained consciousness.

Her family were forced to make the heartbreaking decision to switch 
off her life support machine two days later after being told she would never recover 
from permanent brain damage.

Her devastated husband Lee, 26, said: 'Caroline was so excited at being pregnant but she never got to see our baby.

'But I will make sure I bring her up just as she would have wanted - with a great love of life.

'I will 
tell Haillie-Rose what a beautiful person her mother was. Already I look
 at our little girl and she reminds me of Caroline - it makes me feel 
she is not very far away.'

Mrs
 Howarth had battled with ill health all her life, having been given 
just a 10 per cent chance of survival when she was born with two holes 
in the heart.

Despite suffering from asthma and bouts of pneumonia as a child, she managed to live a normal life.

Eight
 years ago she was told she would never walk again after breaking her 
back in a car accident - but again proved the doctors wrong.

Doctors carried out an emergency Caesarean to deliver Haillie-Rose two months ago, but her mother never regained consciousness

After meeting her husband Lee, she was given the all-clear by doctors to have a baby - but was warned there was only a slight chance of her conceiving due to cysts on her ovaries.

Upon learning they would be parents after all, the couple  picked the baby's name and decorated the nursery in pink, lemon and white, ready for her arrival.

Mr Howarth said: 'We were so looking forward to becoming parents.It breaks my heart that she never got the chance to cuddle up with Haillie-Rose.

'But I will give her loads of cuddles and tell our little girl about her mum and all the bits of the films we used to watch that made her laugh.'

He says 
turning off his wife's life support machine as she lay in the Royal 
Gwent Hospital in Newport was the hardest moment of his life.

'At
 first I couldn't grasp that I was really losing her. I told the doctors
 I wanted to keep Caroline on the machines forever until she woke up.

'But then I realised it wasn't the best thing for her and I had no choice but to let her go.

'I had one thing I knew I had to do for her - I asked nurses to fetch Hallie-Rose from intensive care.

'They
 brought her in into the ward and I lifted her out of her cot and laid 
her next to Caroline. I wanted her  to be with the daughter she never 
got to meet.'

Hallie-Rose, who is now two months old is being brought up by Lee and Caroline's family in Pontypool.

Caroline's mother, Marilyn Brooks, said: 'Even though this has happened Caroline would be over the moon to see that her daughter has had a better start in life than she had herself.

'She was a determined woman who had overcame her health problems to marry her husband Lee and have her child.

'Had she pulled through, she would have been the perfect mother.'
