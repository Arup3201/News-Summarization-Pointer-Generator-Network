A seasoned member of the medical community who has spent 30 years performing autopsies said that the damage done to the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre are ‘probably the worst I’ve seen.’

Connecticut Chief state medical examiner H. Wayne Carver II said in a press conference Saturday afternoon in Newtown that in his three decades in practice, the shooting is the ‘worst I know of any of my colleagues having seen.’

Dr Carver said that each of the 26 victims was shot between there and 11 times, with two of the victims being shot at incredibly close range. The bullets had pierced everywhere, he said – heads, extremities, and torsos.

‘This is a devastating set of injuries,’ he told reporters in the emotionally-charged news conference.

Dr Carver’s 10 technicians and four doctors in his office worked tirelessly throughout Friday night and on into Saturday to identify and perform autopsies on the 26 dead. They expect to be done by tomorrow morning, the Hartford Courant reports.

He said that 20-year-old shooter Adam Lanza was able to reload extremely quickly during the Friday morning blitz because he taped two magazines together.

The shooter mainly used a military-style assault rifle belonging to his mother, Nancy, to carry out the horrific massacre.

Dr Carver went on to say that most of Lanza’s victims were first graders, between the ages of six and seven.

Parents were allowed to identify their children through pictures, a process intended to minimize shock, he said.

The victims of the shooting were shot multiple times by semiautomatic rifle, the medical examiner said Saturday, and he called the injuries 'devastating'

Among the dead were popular Principal Dawn Hochsprung, who town officials say tried to stop the rampage and paid with her life; school psychologist Mary Sherlach, who probably would have helped survivors grapple with the tragedy; a teacher thrilled to have been hired this year; and a six-year-old girl who had just moved to Newtown from Canada.

Dr Carver said that he will personally perform an autopsy on the suspected gunman on Sunday, as well as his mother, Nancy, 52, who was shot dead in her upscale Newtown home.

The shooter’s father, Peter Lanza, today issued a statement detailing the grief his family is going through. 

It reads: ‘Our hearts go out to the families and friends who lost loved ones and to all those who were injured. Our family is grieving along with all those who have been affected by this enormous tragedy. 

‘No words can truly express how heartbroken we are. We are in a state of disbelief and trying to find whatever answers we can.

‘We too are asking why. We have cooperated fully with law enforcement and will continue to do so.

'Like so many of you, we are saddened, but struggling to make sense of what has transpired.'

Connecticut governor Dannel Malloy said in a televised address Saturday afternoon that in instances like this, there is little sense to be made. 

‘There's precious little anyone can say to the families that will lessen the horror and sense of loss they feel. We could say we feel their pain, but the truth is we can't,’ he said.

‘When tragedies like this take place, people often look for answers, an explanation of how this could have occurred. But the sad truth is, there are no answers. No good ones, anyway.

‘We have all seen tragedies like this play out in other states and in other countries. Each time, we have wondered how something so horrific could occur, and we have thanked God that it didn't happen here in Connecticut. But now, sadly, it has.’

President Obama plans to travel to the affluent suburb of 27,000 people about 80 miles from New York City on Sunday to meet with victims' families and speak at a vigil at 7 p.m. local time, the White House said in a statement.
