Public trust in the police is one of the essential ingredients of a well-ordered society. As a former senior officer myself, I can only regret how badly the police's reputation for integrity has been tarnished in recent years.

Now another shattering blow has come with the revelations by this paper about an undercover three-year investigation into serious criminal behaviour and corruption by a group of trusted detectives in the Metropolitan Police.

It appears that much of the evidence of this behaviour — such as files, videos and photographs — may have been deliberately shredded by Scotland Yard in 2003 in an attempt to thwart the anti-corruption investigation. The refusal to risk tarnishing the reputation of the Met has led to a deeply troubling culture of cover-ups.

What makes these findings all the more shocking is the possibility that this web of dishonesty could have undermined Scotland Yard's inquiries into two high-profile murder cases: that of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence and of the private eye Daniel Morgan, who was killed with an axe in the car park of a South London pub in 1987.

At the time of his murder, which still remains unsolved 27 years later, Morgan was carrying out his own investigation into alleged corruption within South London detective squads.

Previous official inquiries into the disastrously botched handling of the Stephen Lawrence murder case have already exposed an insidious police culture of deceit, malpractice, racial prejudice and incompetence.

Now the Home Secretary has ordered another inquiry, this one into serious allegations that the Metropolitan Police sent in undercover officers to spy secretly on the Lawrence family in the aftermath of Stephen's death in 1993.

This new outrage follows other major recent scandals which have shown the police at their worst.

Abuses

One was the notorious Plebgate incident in which officers on duty in Downing Street allegedly conspired to destroy the career of Cabinet Minister Andrew Mitchell by making false accusations against him.

Apart from the corruption itself, one of the features common to all these appalling incidents is the apparent impulse to cover up the wrong-doing, to close ranks, to frustrate and mislead investigators.

Time after time, the instinct of the police is not to face up to the challenge of abuses in their midst, but to pretend that they do not exist. Log books are distorted; statements manufactured. In many of these cases — Plebgate is just one example  — the cover-up and all that goes with it turn out to be worse than the original crime.

One of the more depressing aspects of these recent scandals is that they are so reminiscent of the dark days of the Seventies, when many police forces were riddled with abuses. We had been promised that such misconduct had been consigned to the dustbin of history, that a new era of scrupulously honest policing had arrived.

But the Mail's stories about the shredding of 'lorry loads' of documents and the taking of bribes could have come straight from the police force of 40 years ago, when I was a young officer.

Then, just as today, the vast majority of my colleagues were honourable, decent people who had joined the force to fight crime and protect the public. Corruption, though undoubtedly practised by a few bad apples, was not endemic.

Nevertheless, there was a powerful 'canteen culture' which meant that wrong-doers were often protected, particularly within certain elements of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and some specialist regional squads. They looked after their own, hostile to any outsiders or to scrutiny of their methods.

Detective Inspectors were treated like gods by their men, which fed their sense of invincibility and their belief that they were a law unto themselves. In this climate, a small but significant minority were willing to bend the law, sometimes to get results, sometimes for their own selfish ends.

A few even became allies of criminals. They 'fitted up' innocent men so that the guilty would go free or ensured that charges were dropped. In return for cash, they gave criminal gangs warnings of imminent raids or arrests.

They were willing to lie on oath, siphon off their share of money for informants and even share in the proceeds of drug deals and robberies.

Heroic

It was this culture that Sir Robert Mark was determined to smash when he took over as Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police in 1972, having already won a reputation as a radical reformer when serving as Chief Constable of Leicester.

Sir Robert was a man I admired tremendously because of his natural authority, his straight talking and his determination. When he said he was going to root out corruption, he meant it.

One of his most acerbic pronouncements, which reflected the prevalence of dishonesty in the early Seventies, was: 'A good police force is one which catches more crooks than it employs.'

As a result of his heroic efforts to reform the Met, more than 500 officers were dismissed or forced to resign. Jail sentences were given to two chiefs: Commander Kenneth Drury of the Flying Squad and Detective Chief Superintendent Bill Moody, Head of the Obscence Publications Squad.

Sir Robert's actions may have caused dismay to the corrupt cliques, but his resolute campaign was welcomed by officers like me who were fed up with the way the abusers were destroying the Met's image.

Sadly, Sir Robert resigned in 1977 following a row with the Labour Government, his work still unfinished. None of his successors have matched him for resolution and guts.

That was all too graphically demonstrated when another investigation into Metropolitan Police corruption was held between 1978 and 1982 in the wake of Sir Robert's reforms.

Called Operation Countryman, it was conducted by detectives from Hampshire and Dorset. These men complained bitterly that their investigation had been wilfully obstructed by both the Metropolitan Commissioner Sir David McNee and by the Director of Public Prosecutions Sir Thomas Hetherington.

It was the same story in the mid-Nineties, when I was a Chief Superintendent. Throughout this period, the Commissioner Sir Paul Condon trumpeted his commitment to another anti-corruption drive within his force, but I sensed it was all just empty words. So I decided to challenge him. 'How many senior officers have actually been dismissed for corruption?' I asked.

The answer? None.

That says it all.

Since Sir Robert Mark's courageous fight, real leadership has been sorely lacking at the top of the Met. That is why corrupt coppers have been able to get away with it for far too long.

Since my retirement from the force, I have experienced the police's behaviour from the other side. Acting as a security consultant and adviser, I was involved in a case where the police wanted a central London nightclub to lose its licence because of allegations of disorderly behaviour.

Attack

In court, I was one of the witnesses for the nightclub. I made a list of recommendations on how the club could be better run.

What amazed me was how the police, opposing my stance, were willing to undermine my record, attack my credibility as an expert, and even wrongly question my former rank to ensure that they won their argument.

If the police were willing to do this to me, who had once been in charge of protecting the Queen and the Royal Family, what might they be willing to do to an ordinary member of the public?

Sir Robert Mark almost succeeded in cleaning up the Augean stables of the force 40 years ago.

Will the present-day Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe be up to the job? If the news reports of recent days are anything to go by, the task remains Herculean.
