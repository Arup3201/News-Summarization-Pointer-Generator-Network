Stuart Lancaster’s preparation for the 2015 Rugby World Cup has even extended to staging meetings with his players’ partners as well as their agents.

England’s coach has handed every player a detailed dossier explaining his plans for them over the next year, specifying when he wants them to rest so they peak for the start of the tournament next September.

But Lancaster has chosen to include wives and girlfriends in those plans, calling them to a meeting at the team hotel to explain the demands that will be put on partners.

Lancaster’s mantra is that they are ‘all in this together’ in a bid to win the World Cup, with the added pressure of being tournament hosts.

He also felt it important to have it explained to the players’ partners that they, too, could come under greater scrutiny — not least from the media — in the build-up to the tournament; a lesson the England football team learned at the 2006 World Cup.

The players’ agents and representatives met Lancaster at Twickenham, where they were told they are now regarded as part of the wider England operation.

Lancaster stressed the need to make preparation for the World Cup a priority before pursuing any commercial deals for players.

Lancaster has banned newspaper columns and video diaries for the duration of the World Cup but wants a collective commitment to the cause to go way beyond that. It is understood he used one particular player as an illustration of what he expects — the player having delayed his wedding until 2016 so that his focus for next year remains on the tournament.

All the players have been told they must have a three-week rest next summer as part of the programme geared towards delivering England in the best possible condition for that opening game against Fiji at Twickenham on September 18.

‘Stuart’s attention to detail is second to none,’ one insider has told Sportsmail. ‘You look at the stuff the players have been given and it tells them when to go to bed, when to rest, the need for a three-week break at the end of this season; it’s all designed to ensure they peak at the right time.

‘But the wives and girlfriends and the agents were called in to make sure that everyone is on the same page; that everyone understands that trying to win the World Cup is what the next year is all about.’
