Frankly, they look like a reasonably ordinary pair of white trainers. But try telling that to Beyonce – or animal rights campaigners.

For these shoes, commissioned by the singer, are made from no fewer than five different animal skins: stingray, anaconda, ostrich, crocodile and calf.

Fans and animal welfare groups alike condemned Beyonce, 31, as ‘cruel’ and ‘spoilt’ for having the trainers made.

A spokesman for animal charity PETA said: ‘These custom-made kicks come 
with a high price – and it’s paid by the various animals who were beaten
and skinned alive or cruelly farmed and killed.’

He added: ‘We hope 
that one day she’ll go completely cruelty-free.’

Andrew Tyler, director of Animal Aid, described the trainers as ‘a 
brazen publicity stunt’. ‘The less that is said about it the better,’ he
added.

The cream colour shoes are a take on the wedge-style trainer, made popular by designer Isabel Marant, but given a so-called Eden makeover by PMK using a hybrid of land and sea skins.

Called The King-Bey, the shoes, which have been given Beyonce's approval, are decorated with gold accents. The price is as yet undisclosed, but a regular pair sells in excess of £230 ($350) so this embellished pair would sell for far more.

PMK is a favourite brand of Beyonce and her A-list husband Jay Z - indeed, Jay Z had a shoe designed for him last year- the Brooklyn Zoo - by the brand. His pair were as lavish as his wife's, with an endless roll call of reptile skins used to make the shoe.

Of the trainer they designed for Jay-Z, PMK said: ‘The Brooklyn Zoo 1′s cannot be tamed with an elaborate combination of elephant-print, ostrich, python, boa, crocodile, lizard, alligator, suede, and sting ray intricately cut to transform the Jordan 1 from a basketball sneaker into the world's most daring and dapper sneaker concepts known to man.'

A coat made of rats?

You’ve already got the leather jacket, the snakeskin shoes and the alligator handbag.

Now how about a coat made out of rats?

Designers are turning to rodents and other bizarre animals to give new texture to their clothes.

Earlier this month, New York design duo Cushnie and Ochs showed a skirt and jacket made from kangaroo calfskin during Fashion Week.

They described it as ‘like long-haired velvet, like a teddy bear’.

New York label Proenza Schouler, which made eel skirts in the past, presented dresses, skirts and coats in ostrich skin.

But Billy Reid beat them all with a coat made from nutrias — a semi-aquatic rodent considered a pest in their native Louisiana.
