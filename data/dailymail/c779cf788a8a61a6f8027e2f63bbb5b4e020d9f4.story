A barrister is suing Harvey Nichols for up to £1million, claiming she was assaulted and imprisoned by staff in a row over her dog.

Marianne Perkins, 42, says guards held her in a ‘vice-like grip’ after she tried to take the miniature puppy into the Knightsbridge store.

Her ‘tiny Maltese puppy’ Lilly, which was in a dog carrier handbag, was ‘intentionally elbowed’ in the incident in September 2010.

Damages: Marianne Perkins claims she was assaulted by security staff at Harvey Nichols following a dispute over whether she was allowed to bring her 'tiny' puppy into the store

'Tiny': The insolvency barrister says staff 'intentionally elbowed' her Maltese puppy Lilly, who was inside her handbag

The insolvency barrister’s writ lodged
at the High Court demands compensation for false imprisonment and 
personal injury, as well as the costs of medical treatment for injuries 
to her dog.

Her barrister, Henrietta Hill, says in
the writ that Miss Perkins was confronted by a security guard seconds 
after she entered the London store. Following an angry exchange, she was
told to leave.

She met a friend outside but – as they
walked down the stairs at Knightsbridge Tube station – she ‘was 
surrounded by four to six men who took hold of her’.

‘The men were members of staff from 
the store,’ the writ said. ‘The men used vice-like grips on her upper 
arms to hold her and pinched and squeezed her arms.

‘They also jabbed their elbows into 
Miss Perkins’s body and into Lilly. Miss Perkins was shouting and saying
that she was being hurt.’

She claims she was dragged up the 
stairs and kept for 25 minutes with ‘no legal basis’, until the police 
arrived and detained her for five hours.

The guards had accused her of screaming and swearing at the female security worker and punching her in the face.

‘This was plainly untrue,’ Miss Hill 
said. ‘She was later told by the police she would not be charged 
because, having viewed the CCTV footage, it was clear no assault had 
taken place.’

Miss Perkins, from South London, says she developed post-traumatic stress disorder and depression following the ‘assault’.

Her claim relates to psychiatric injury and lost earnings.

Miss Hill says that Miss Perkins 
‘suffered extensive bruising to her arms which lasted for about ten 
days’. ‘As a result of her psychiatric injuries she has been unable to 
work as a barrister, other than undertaking one case in November 2010,’ 
the writ states.

She is seeking aggravated damages because of the ‘fear,
humiliation, anger and powerlessness she felt’.

As well as her legal work, Miss 
Perkins runs a luxury dog accessories business. Items include a £600 
jewelled lead. Last year, she appeared with Lilly in a BBC2 documentary 
about pampered pets called, Wonderland: Walking With Dogs.

A Harvey Nichols spokesman said: ‘As 
this matter is subject to ongoing court proceedings, we are unable to 
comment further at this stage.’

The store has just launched an ad campaign featuring models carrying oversized lap dogs in handbags.
