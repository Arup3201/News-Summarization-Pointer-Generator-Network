Despite the findings, the city of Cardiff remains popular with tourists .

A spokesperson for Cardiff Tourism told MailOnline: 'I think the rain isn't just confined to Cardiff, as I think Wales can be quite a wet place on the whole really.

'But we have some fantastic indoor attractions that can be enjoyed if it's raining; we have Cardiff Castle and the National Museum that are both really popular.

'Then we also have the Cardiff Story, again indoor, that details the magnificent history of our city.

'I think Cardiff remains a really popular destination for tourists throughout Europe and the world. I have noticed more and more people are visiting from South America now, so they're obviously not put off by any rain.'

The Cardiff Bay regeneration project continues to attract tourists from Europe and afar

Cardiff Castle is one of the main attractions - and offers shelter if the weather takes a turn for the worse

The Cardiff Bay regeneration project, situated in the south of the capital has been heralded by developers as one of the most successful regeneration projects of it's kind.

'Cardiff Bay is very popular with tourists, and has great indoor areas and restaurants, so the rain certainly doesn't put anyone off visiting here,' added the spokesman. 

The data on wettest cities was collected by Manchester Evening news, who will have been pleased to see North West only just sneak into the top ten for average rainfall, eighth with 84.3cms.

But it wasn't so much good news when it came to average number of days of rainfall, with 152 days a year calling for the umbrella.
