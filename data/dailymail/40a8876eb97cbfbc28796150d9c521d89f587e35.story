Scotland golden boy Ikechi Anya has emerged as a transfer target for Celtic following his weekend heroics in Germany.

A £1.5million move for the Watford winger was discussed by Parkhead coaching staff when Ronny Deila scoured the market for wing reinforcements last month.

Celtic eventually settled on loan deals for Ghanaian Wakaso Mubarak and Aleksandar Tonev.

Attracting interest: Scotland star Ikechi Anya is wanted by Celtic

Anya’s stock has risen following a composed strike against the world champions in Dortmund, however, and Sportsmail understands the Scottish champions have asked Anya’s representatives to keep them informed of his situation.

Linked with Crystal Palace, Sunderland and Cardiff in the summer, the 26-year-old is keen on a return to Glasgow, the city where he was born to a Nigerian father and Romanian mother.

And Scotland manager Gordon Strachan believes Anya is destined for bigger things than the English Championship after his second Scotland goal in seven appearances.

Magic moment: Anya scored against Germany in Sunday's qualifier

‘The coaching staff scratch our heads at times and wonder why he is not playing in the English Premier League,’ said Strachan last night.

‘It’s not mugs he’s playing against here - it’s Germany, Croatia, Belgium and England. The Macedonians were no mugs either and he scored against them, too.

‘There is no doubt about it. He could go to a Celtic or to a club in the English Premier League no bother.

‘He can play different positions, too, which makes him even more valuable. He can play on the left as he did against Germany, he can play on the right side, he can even play left-back. He has not got a problem with any of them.

‘And he has a love for the game which is so refreshing. I think he’s worked so hard to get to where he is right now that he doesn’t want to lose it.’

Anya’s 66th-minute strike against the Germans raised hopes – briefly – of a stunning start to the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign.

Racing on to a Steven Fletcher pass, he outpaced the German defence and slotted the ball with aplomb past Manuel Neuer, widely hailed as the world’s best goalkeeper.

‘When he was running through I thought to myself: “Right, you’ve just sprinted for 30 yards and now you’re up against the best goalie in the world”,’ said Strachan.

High praise: Scotland boss Gordon Strachan says Anya wouldn't look out of place in the Premier League

‘But he stuck it away as if it was in a training game. The ball hasn’t trickled into the back of the net either, he knew exactly what he was doing.

‘His personality is really infectious. Every morning myself and the staff are the first ones up for breakfast. We make sure of it. Sometimes we are even there before breakfast opens up.

‘But every morning Ikechi is the first player through those doors. Always. Never fails.

‘He looks like he’s a guy who can’t wait to get out of his bed in the morning, to go training and to meet people. Other ones trawl in at different times but his personality is: “Right, I want to make the most of what I’ve got”.

‘Maybe it’s because he came into professional football so late on in life. You have to take a few knocks in life to appreciate what you’ve got and that might be the cas
