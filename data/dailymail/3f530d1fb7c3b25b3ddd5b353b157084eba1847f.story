A cyclist rented a Boris Bike and used it to bike up one of the toughest stages of Tour de France, before returning the bike to London with just 22 seconds to spare.

Robert Holden and two friends hired the bike in London's Southwark before crossing the channel on the Eurostar train with the bike in a van.

The trio made the 800 mile journey to Mont Ventoux in southern France where Rob cycled to the top of the 6,273ft peak using the Boris Bike's tree gears.

Mr Holden and his friends Ian Laurie and Matthew Winstone then drove all the way back to London and managed to return the bike just 22 seconds short of the 24-hour deadline which would have incurred a £150 fine.

Mr Holden said: ‘We went for a cycle and stopped for a coffee.

‘Out of the blue, Ian just said 'I wonder if you can rent a Boris Bike and take it down to Mont Ventoux, ride it up and bring it back within 24 hours.'

‘We all had a bit of a laugh at that, but then we decided to give it a go.’

Mr Holden paid £2 to hire the heavy 22kg bike at 3:59 on Saturday October 26 from a docking station in Southwark, London.

Fight or flight: The trio rented the bike on a 24-hour-hire and after taking the Eurostar to France they drover 800 miles to Mont Ventoux

Freewheeling: The ride up Mont Venteaux is considered one of the toughest stages of Tour de France, and Rob only had three gears to help him on his way

All the way: Mont Ventoux in Provence, France, is over 6,000ft tall, which Rob managed to conquer in just under three hours

The trio then bundled it into a van, 
and drove to the Eurostar, and then made their way more than 720 miles 
across France to the base of the 6,270ft mountain.

Supported
 by his friends, Mr Holden had to battle against cramp and exhaustion to
 pedal the 14-mile route to the top of the mountain, and managed to 
conquer it in just under three hours.

He took the toughest southern route which has an average gradient of 7.43 per cent.

Rob
 battled 25 degree heat, cramp and a heavy bike, unlike professional 
riders who have 20-plus gears and ultra-lightweight frames.

Rob said: ‘I had no idea what to expect. I was just taking it one kilometre at a time.’

After reaching the summit the trio drove back to London, where they dropped the bike off at a docking station.

Filmmaker Ian Laurie, from Kingston, Surrey said: ‘The only real thing we could do was see if we got the fine or not.

‘I never for one second thought that we would be that close.

‘We were the last vehicle that was allowed on the Euro Tunnel going back. Then it was ten minutes late.’

Mr Holden and his friends pushed themselves to the limit to raise money for Macmillan Cancer Support, and have already raised an impressive £3,600.

Ian said: ‘The charity thing was very much one of the reasons for doing it. It would be a waste not to raise money.’

In 1967, British cyclist Tommy Simpson died of exhaustion trying to reach the summit of Mont Ventoux during the Tour de France.

The route from the south is 14 miles long and although a professional rider can manage it around the one hour-mark, a trained amateur cyclist can make the ascent in under three hours.
