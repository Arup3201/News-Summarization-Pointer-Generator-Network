Penalty king Rickie Lambert wants the responsibility of taking England’s spot-kicks at the World Cup.

Lambert has converted all 34 penalties he has taken for Southampton since he joined from Bristol Rovers in August 2009.

He hasn’t missed from the spot since February that year when he was still playing for the Pirates.

Spot on: Rickie Lambert wants to be given the responsibility of taking England's penalties at the World Cup

On target: Lambert has converted all 34 penalties he has taken since signing for Southampton back in 2009

Lambert said: ‘If the chance comes up I am comfortable to score. A lot of people have said I am in for my penalties but I don’t believe that at all. But I would take one, of course I would. I am confident in my ability.’

Wayne Rooney is England’s regular penalty-taker but Lambert is lethal from 12 yards. The Southampton striker is guaranteed to be one of England’s nominated penalty-takers if they are taken to yet another shootout at a major tournament.

England have a dreadful record in shootouts and were predictably beaten by Italy at Euro 2012 when it came to penalties against Cesare Prandelli’s side. 

Lambert added: ‘I have my own technique and sometimes my technique wouldn’t be beneficial to someone else. It is a little bit of practice but mainly it is about mentality. I have a certain way of approaching it and it has worked well for me.’

Earlier this week, Lambert, in a book called Twelve Yards: The Art and Psychology of the Perfect Penalty, claimed professionals should never miss. The Saints striker is quoted as saying: ‘I see a penalty as a free shot from 12 yards and a professional should score from that distance 10 times out of 10, so if you hit it well you’ll be all right.’

Southampton team-mate Luke Shaw, who spoke alongside Lambert at an England media day, has only taken one penalty in competition. He said: ‘I took one playing for England  Under 17s, it might have been Under 16s. I remember it hit the bar, I’m not sure it went in but it counted anyway. 

‘That is the only penalty I have taken.’
