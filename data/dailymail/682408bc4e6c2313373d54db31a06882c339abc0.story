The previous record this year was set in Exeter on January 9 when temperatures reached 16.5C.

Craig Snell, forecaster at the Met Office, said: 'It has been very pleasant day for many parts of the UK.

'Most of the country has seen the warmest day of the year with the exception of western Scotland, where it has been quite wet.

'As we go through tomorrow the rain will clear Scotland and make its way south towards England and Wales.

'Temperatures will return to around average, with highs of 10C (50F) to 11C (51.8F), cooling off a little bit but still not cold by any means.

'As we go into Sunday night it will be cold, with temperatures close to freezing in many spots if the sky is clear.

'Next week will see quite changeable weather but nothing out of the ordinary for this time of year.'

Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill had earlier said that there was a '50 per cent' chance Britain would experience the hottest day of the year. 

The mild spring weather is likely to be short lived - the Met Office has forecast tomorrow to see  13C with 'pleasant sunshine' in the south, east and Midlands, before rain sweeps south later in the day, with rain for most and gales up to 60mph on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday.

Met Office forecaster Simon Partridge said: 'Sunday is due 12C or higher locally if cloud breaks, before rain pushes south.

'All areas will see rain on Monday, with heavy rain and gales or severe gales in the North-West. Tuesday will be fine with 13C, but with rain and strong winds for most on Wednesday and Thursday.'
