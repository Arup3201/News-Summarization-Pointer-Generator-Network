A ruthless drug smuggler known as the 'Godmother of Cocaine' who was jailed in the U.S. for three chilling murders has been gunned down by a motorcycle-riding hitman.

Griselda Blanco, 69, was believed to have ordered dozens of executions during the notorious 'cocaine cowboys' era of the 1970s and 80s in Miami.

In a grim irony, the mode of her killing was eerily similar to the brutal drive-by killings she herself introduced to slaughter her enemies.

butcher's shop in Colombia at the age of 69 in what many say is a 
fitting end to her life of drug smuggling and murder

Ruthless: The Colombian was jailed for 20 years for three murders in the U.S. including that of a two-year-old

Although she was suspected of murdering many more, the Colombian was eventually convicted of three killings in 1985, including that of a two-year-old boy, for which she served nearly 20 years behind bars.

In 2004, she was deported to her native country and maintained a low profile in her hometown of Medellin.

According
 to Colombian press reports, she was walking out of a butcher's shop 
yesterday when two gunmen on motorbikes pulled up before one pumped two 
bullets into her head.

For a
 woman who had been credited with inventing the notion of a 'motorcycle 
assassin', the manner of her death came as no surprise to many, it was 
reported in The Miami Herald.

Nelson
 Andreu, a former Miami homicide detective who had investigated her, 
said: 'It’s surprising to all of us that she had not been killed sooner 
because she made a lot of enemies.

'When
 you kill so many and hurt so many people like she did, it’s only a 
matter of time before they find you and try to even the score.'

Brought
 up in the slums of Medellin, Blanco went from a simple pickpocket to 
command an empire that shipped an estimated 3,400lbs of cocaine a month.

She also symbolised the 
blood-soaked era of the 1970s and 80s when gangs would ambush their 
rivals in public, leading to her cartel being dubbed the 'Cocaine 
Cowboys'.

She ran the empire with three of her 
sons, two of whom were later assassinated in Colombia, while three of 
her husbands have also been killed in drug-related violence.

Known for her flamboyant lifestyle, she named one of her sons Michael Corleone in tribute to The Godfather movies.

Blanco's
 exploits were also popularised in the 2006 documentary Cocaine Cowboys, 
which explored the rise of the drug in Miami during the 1970s and 80s 
which inspired the films Scarface and Miami Vice.

Interviewees argue that Blanco played a major role in the history of the drug trade in the city and other areas across America.

Detectives believe she was behind at least 40 murders and maybe even as many as 240, but could only link her to three.

Two of them, drug dealers Alfredo and 
Grizel Lorenzo, were shot at their South Miami house after failing to 
pay $250,000 for 5kg of cocaine.

Blanco was also convicted of ordering a shooting that led to the death of two-year-old Johnny Castro, who was shot twice in the head as he drove in the car with his father, Jesus 'Chucho' Castro.

She was fully expected to end up on Florida's Death Row.

But she was able to cut a plea deal after the prosecution's case suffered a major setback when a chief witness was caught engaging in phone sex with secretaries from the attorney's office.

Blanco later entered into a bargain with new prosecutors and was given three 20-year sentences in 1985. She only served a third of that time.

Prior to the mid-1970s, marijuana had been the main import into Miami and the surrounding areas.

But over the following years this was replaced by more lucrative cocaine.

Crime lords used many different tactics to smuggle drugs into the country, but the main routes were by boat or air.

The distribution networks were highly elaborate and technology such as electronic homing devices were employed to keep track of shipments.

Condominiums were bought near the ocean to act as reconnaissance stations to look out for coast guards and cartels monitored the radio frequencies of Federal, State and local authorities.

Legitimate businesses were then bought to shield these operations from the outside world.

The 2006 documentary Cocaine Cowboys, right, reveals that much of the economic growth in Miami came from the drug trade as the cash that flowed into these businesses went on to indirectly finance the construction of many high-rise buildings in southern Florida.

When law enforcement finally got on top of the corruption, many companies folded because of falling sales.
