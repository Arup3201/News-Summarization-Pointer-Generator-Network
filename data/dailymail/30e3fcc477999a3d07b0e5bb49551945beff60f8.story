Premier League champions are rarely motivated by revenge but Manchester City have more than one reason for wanting payback against Chelsea on Sunday

For City goalkeeper Joe Hart there is the memory of a costly mistake at Stamford Bridge last October that led to him being dropped and the feeling that he is still not fully trusted by Manuel Pellegrini.

For Pellegrini, there is the irritation that after two League defeats by Chelsea last season, people consider Jose Mourinho to be tactically superior.

When two men dislike each other as much as they do, that has to hurt. It helps to build a rivalry fast approaching Liverpool-Manchester United in the grudge stakes. Both sides were touted as title contenders before a ball had been kicked — but City already trail by five points. 

Then there is the personal stuff. It is 11 months since Hart gifted a late goal to Fernando Torres in Chelsea’s 2-1 victory. 

Furious Pellegrini dropped his keeper for three months and only now, after an outstanding display against Bayern Munich, has Hart proved himself to be back to his best. ‘I love playing football, whether it’s against Bayern, Chelsea or Hull. 

'But I have to play well to get the opportunity to keep on loving it,’ admits Hart, who acknowledges his side cannot allow Chelsea to win if City want to retain their crown.

‘Last year’s results against Chelsea were really tough pills and nearly cost us dearly. 

'We did end up as champions but we’re not champions this year so we need a result. ‘We’re obviously expecting a tough game — Chelsea are a good side, very powerful.

Joe Hart has revenge on his mind when Manchester City entertain title rivals Chelsea on Sunday

Manuel Pellegrini dropped Joe Hart after his clanger at Chelsea last season but the England No1 has recovered well from the setback and gone on to impress for club and country ever since

'They have improved since last year, but so have we. I’d say we’re a better team. We’ve had a good year under the manager, we understand. him a lot more and we’ve in bought a few good players.’ 

Hart, who is waiting for a contract offer indicating Pellegrini really wants to keep him, does not have the luxury of being undisputed No 1. Pellegrini has signed Willy Caballero and Hart has no option but to fight for his place. 

‘There is no malice or back-stabbing between the goalkeepers. We both want to catch the manager’s eye,’ said the England keeper. ‘It is the reality of the situation, I can’t moan about it and I can’t be too happy about it, and if I want to stay it’s going to be the reality. I’ve got players challenging and I have to enjoy it every day.’ 

Pellegrini, on the other hand, has sounded off against referees and Uefa after an indifferent start and is surprised people remember Chelsea’s wins against City but forget he got the better of Mourinho, who mocked the Chilean for not winning the league at Real Madrid, with a 2-0 fifth-round FA Cup win. 

Despite Chelsea’s 15 goals in four games, Pellegrini still sees Mourinho as a defensive coach. ‘We know exactly the way Chelsea play and they do it very well because they are used to doing it that way,’ he said. 

‘And we must continue playing our way. We won’t change because we lost 1-0 in February to a goal from Branislav Ivanovic.’ Chelsea’s threat could come from in-form Diego Costa, but City boss Pellegrini has Sergio Aguero in his ranks. 

Pellegrini seems resigned to the fact that Mourinho has had as much credit for masterminding a win at the Etihad as the Chilean did for winning the title. ‘I am not annoyed or surprised about anything,’ he mutters unconvincingly. It seems that revenge is definitely in the air.
