Google has finally taken the shades off and unveiled their 'Goggles' project.

The search giant is selling early models of its Google Glass augmented reality glasses this week for $1,500 to a select group of developers.

The glasses are designed to let users capture video with a built-in camera as well as use apps, the internet, and social networking sites on the move.

A small projector displays an image in front of the wearer's eyes while letting them stay aware on the outside world. 

The idea is to bypass computers, tablets and smartphones entirely and keep the user connected in a (fairly) discreet way.

Ready for sale: Selected software developers have chance to pay $1,500 to order an advance version of Google Glass, which was displayed by co-founder Sergey Brin at the Google I/O conference on Wednesday

Success: Two stunt riders delivered a Google Glass to go-founder Sergey Brin after a spectacular demonstration that was streamed live through the devices

The glasses seem likely to appeal to runners, bicyclists and other athletes who want to take pictures of their activities as they happen.

Photos and video can be programmed to be taken at automatic intervals during any activity.

Brin said he became excited about the project when he tossed his son in the air and a picture taken by the glasses captured the joyful moment, just the way he saw it.

'That was amazing,' Brin said. 'There was no way I could have that memory without this device.'

Google points out that this is experimental technology, and a first generation device.

But for those who want the cutting-edge, and are willing to try something new, the glasses offer a potentially revolutionary way of communicating.

With the glasses, directions to your 
destination or a text message from a friend can appear literally before 
your eyes.

You can converse with friends in a video chat, take a photo 
or even buy a few things online as you walk around.

In
development for more than two years, the project is the brainchild of 
Google X, the online search leader's secret facility that spawned the 
self-driving car and could one day let people ride elevators into space.

Isabelle
Olsson, an engineer on the Glass project, said the company created the 
glasses for people to interact with the virtual world without 
distracting them from the physical world.

It is designed to interact 
closely with your senses, without blocking them.

She
said Google had two broad goals in mind: communications through images 
and quick access to information. The device has a camera to capture 
fleeting moments and allow others to see the world through your eyes.

Extreme: The Glass demonstration was meant to prove that the device is ready for users to begin testing it and pushing its limits

The
Glass wasn't Google's only big product announcement at its 2010 I/O 
conference.

The search giant signalled it was likely to begin competing 
directly with Apple and Samsung with the launch of several new devices 
and features.

Nexus 7

This 
is Google's entry into the tablet market. For $200, the system runs the 
company's Android operating system.

It is built to give consumers an 
alternative to the iPad.

Nexus Q

This
black sphere plugs into the TV and allows users to stream videos from 
the Google Play store and YouTube.

At $300, it costs three times what 
Apple TV does, although Nexus Q is made in America. 

Android 4.1 - 'Jellybean'

A
new version of its smart phone operating system is meant to look and 
feel more 'streamlined.'

It also offers a version of Apple's 'Siri' 
along with voice control.

Brin told reporters that Google 
intends to sell the glasses for significantly less once the product is 
released to the mass market. He said Google hopes to start selling the 
device to consumers in early 2014.

'I think we are definitely pushing the limits,' Brin said during a question-and-answer session with reporters.

'That is our job: to push edges of technology into the future.'

The company showed that users are ready 
to start testing the limits of its new product with a dramatic 
demonstration.

Daredevils skydived from a blimp above the annual Google
I/O conference onto the roof, then abseiled down the side of the 
building - all broadcast live to the conference from souped-up versions of the Glass.

Google is offering the first shot at 
the the device, known as Project Glass, to people attending the San 
Fancisco gathering for computer programmers.

It will ship early next year and won't be available for sale outside the three-day conference, which started Wednesday.

'This is new technology and we really want you to shape it,' Google co-founder Sergey Brin told about 6,000 attendees.

'We want to get it out into the hands of passionate people as soon as possible.'

Experience: Google has already released a sneak-peak at the user-interface for the Glass, which broadcasts data directly in front of the eye, bypassing cell phones

Then, another team took over and rode BMX stunt bikes over a ramp, which led to a team rappelling down the side of the building. Finally, another stunt cyclist delivered one of the devices into the conference auditorium and into Brin's hands.   

But for all the dramatic stunts, the demonstration showed only that Google Glass is durable and capable of streaming video. It offered no glimpse of the device's functionality or user interface. 

Google had given a glimpse of the technology in a video posted earlier this year.
