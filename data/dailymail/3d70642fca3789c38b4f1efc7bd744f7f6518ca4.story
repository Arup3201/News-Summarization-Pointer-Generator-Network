There's a good chance she'll get a few extra Choccy Drops in her pay packet after receiving this award.

A tiny dog called Lucy has been named
by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's smallest working dog.

The little
Yorkshire terrier is just 5.7inches high and weighs only 2.5lb. 

She was handed the certificate in recognition of her work as a
therapy dog with the elderly and disabled.

Aged three
and six inches long, Lucy works in a programme called Leashes Of Love and visits
hospitals, nursing homes and special schools in Smithville, New Jersey.

The title
is awarded according to weight - meaning Lucy smashed the previous record held
by a six pound search and rescue dog in Japan.

Even
though she weighs less then 12 sausages, she now has a huge status among
working dogs around the world.

'I said I bet she's not the tiniest,
but I'm sure she's the tiniest therapy dog,' said owner Sally Leone
Montufar, 56, on her putting forward Lucy for the title.

Despite
Lucy being a record breaker, Sally remembered how she came within a whisker of
never owning the pipsqueak dog.

'A
lady came into the pet boutique I work in with several dogs, hoping someone
would claim them before she had to take them to the shelter.

'I
became fixed focused on the lady's Juicy Couture dog bag, and the little nose
poking out of it.

'The
bag was very beautiful and out came this peanut.

'She
was so pitiful and lethargic I couldn't leave her. 

'As any a mother
would, I vowed to help her. I wasn't going to turn my back. The
others looked pretty healthy but she didn't.'
