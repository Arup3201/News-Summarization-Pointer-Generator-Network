Political duo, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton teamed up on stage at the White House yesterday.

The smartly-dressed mother-daughter hosted a ticketed forum on illegal wildlife trafficking, calling for a return to the stricter anti-poaching rules of the Nineties.

Later in the day, former secretary of state, Hillary also took the opportunity to endorse President Obama's call for military strikes against Syria.

According to the Washington Post she said 'it would be an important step' if Syrian President Bashar al-Assad surrendered his stockpile of chemical weapons.

'The Assad regimeâ€™s inhuman use of weapons of mass destruction against innocent men, women and children violates a universal norm at the heart of our global order, and therefore it demands a strong response from the international community, led by the United States,' she continued.

As a U.S. senator in 2002, Hillary Clinton endorsed military action in Iraq, a decision that came back to haunt her in her failed White House campaign six years later.

Well done: During her speech, Chelsea called for a return to stricter anti-poaching rules

Now, the 65-year-old potential 2016 presidential candidate is risking the possibility of a similar political situation in a future campaign with her support of President Obama's call for a U.S.-led military strike in Syria as punishment for the use of chemical weapons.

The two conflicts are different: Iraq was a full-fledged war with ground troops that lasted nearly nine years, while the Obama administration is talking about a limited, focused air attack in Syria.

Even so, opponents could use Clinton's position against her in a future campaign.

'The world will have to deal with this threat as swiftly and comprehensively as possible,' Clinton said Monday in her first public endorsement of Obama's plan to respond to Syria's chemical weapons use.

Lost in thought: Later in the day Hillary Clinton took the opportunity to endorse President Obama's call for military strikes against Syria

She welcomed suggestions that the Assad regime may surrender its stockpile of chemical weapons, but echoed warnings from the Obama administration that 'this cannot be another excuse for delay and obstruction.'

She's expected to repeat her stance in a speech Tuesday, despite widespread American and congressional opposition to military intervention.

An Associated Press poll released Monday found that most Americans oppose even a limited attack - likely with cruise missiles - and about half are fearful that a strike would lead to a long-term U.S. military commitment in Syria.

As she did with the Iraq vote nearly a dozen years ago, Clinton is betting she will be on the right side of history by standing with Obama despite the public opinion polls and a divided Congress.

It was similar to the gamble she made in 2002 when she voted to give President George W. Bush the authorization to use force in Iraq. The resolution passed the Senate, and public opinion was more supportive of war.

By the time the 2008 presidential primary campaign came around, support for the war had soured. Obama, who had spoken out in opposition to the war as an Illinois state senator, won the Democratic nomination over Clinton in part by playing up the differences in their positions on the Iraq war.

Clinton's supporters say this time is different, and they argue that she will be rewarded politically for sticking by the president. Clinton's support was not exactly a surprise.

As the nation's top diplomat, she supported intervening in Syria with a proposal in the summer of 2012 to arm vetted units of the Syrian rebels.

The White House later turned down those plans. Clinton also pushed attempts in the United Nations to develop a political transition in Syria and provide humanitarian aid to Syrians.

The Clinton Foundation, set up after the 42nd president left the White House, was renamed a few weeks ago to include all three Clintons in the name.

Chelsea Clinton, 33, has become vastly more engaged in running operations over recent years, taking on the role as vice chair.

The New York Times reported this summer that the family are now trying to raise a $250million endowment

According to the Washington Post after giving their speeches on Monday evening the Clintons held a cocktail reception at the Italian Embassy, with tickets costing $1,000 a person.

Later they hosted a dinner at their home on Whitehaven Street for $25,00 per couple.
