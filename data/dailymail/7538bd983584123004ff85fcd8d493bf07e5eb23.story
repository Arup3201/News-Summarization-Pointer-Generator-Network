It is arguably one of the most iconic symbols of London; its pioneering design and bright red colour instantly recognised all over the world.

And now, this rather large slice of London transport history could be yours - provided you can stump up enough cash, of course.

This 1966 RML 
Leyland London Routemaster double-decker bus is expected to fetch between £20,000 and £30,000 when it is sold at auction next month.

The vintage vehicle has formed part of a special exhibition and auction organised by Christie's to celebrate London's historic year in 2012.

The one-off event - titled The London Sale - has consisted of an extended six-week exhibition, which has been open during London's Olympic summer, ending in the auction on September 3.

Comprising a total of 167 lots, the exhibition and sale has been showcasing a wide range of items synonymous with London.

It has included pictures and prints as well as rock 
and roll, Royal, Olympic and political memorabilia, along with the 1966 RML 
Leyland London Routemaster double-decker bus.

Collectors will be given the opportunity to acquire pieces of the city's iconic imagery and history with the auction at the end of the exhibition.

The buses were introduced by London Transport in 1956 and saw continuous service in London until 2005

Introduced by London Transport in 
1956, the Routemaster double-decker bus was built by Associated 
Equipment Company and Park Royal Vehicles in 1954.

They
were in production between 1958 and 1968 and saw continuous service in 
London until 2005. And they remain on two heritage routes in central 
London.

The front-engined 
buses' pioneering design featured rear boarding platforms and outlasted 
several of its replacement types in the capital, survived the 
privatisation of the former London Transport bus operators and was also 
used by other operators around the UK.

The Routemaster has retained its iconic status, despite the retirement of the original design. A modernised and updated version entered service in London in February 2012.
