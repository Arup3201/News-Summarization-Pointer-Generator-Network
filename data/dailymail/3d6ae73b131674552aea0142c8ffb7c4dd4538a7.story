A bitter bride has condemned NatWest after it ruined her honeymoon and described their stunt of delivering £1,000 cash to make amends as 'too little, too late.' 

Newlyweds Kimberley and Dominic Proffitt were left devastated when they were unable to jet off after their wedding because of the bank's computer problems.

Generous wedding guests surprised the couple by collecting £1,000 to send the pair on a romantic once-in-a-lifetime break to the Greek island of Rhodes.

Joy: Kimberley Dominic Proffitt, pictured on their wedding day, had their hopes of enjoying a romantic honeymoon on a Greek island dashed when their payment was rejected because of the NatWest computer meltdown

But after banking the cash in 
preparation to book an online deal, Kimberley and Dominic, 34, found 
their money had been trapped by the bank's major computer ‘glitch’. 

They were left grounded because travel
agents could not process their debit card due to the computer meltdown,
which has caused a backlog of 100 million transactions.

And Kimberley branded a gesture by local bank boss Tracy Tonry of turning up on their doorstep to hand delivering their £1,000 in cash, several days later, as 'too little too late'.

Grounded: Kimberley Proffitt saw her chance at a dream honeymoon destroyed when the NatWest computer glitch meant she could not book the tickets

Insurance clerk Kimberley, 25 and from
Codsall, West Midlands said: ‘The wedding day was perfect - we had a 
vintage Rolls Royce, three-course meal and I had a beautiful dress.

‘So when this happened with our bank account, we were just in shock.

‘I couldn’t believe that we would not be going on our honeymoon. We were absolutely devastated’

The couple, who have been together for
four years, chose not to have a present list, and instead asked friends
and family to contribute to the honeymoon.

‘We had everything we wanted,’ added Kimberley.

‘We didn’t want to presume, but everyone was so generous.’

Kimberley had the first inkling something was wrong on Monday evening when she and Dominic treated their bridesmaids to a meal.

She said: ‘I paid by card at the bar and the card was declined, so our bridesmaids had to pay in cash and pay for us too.

‘The barman looked at the card and 
said, “Oh, it’s a NatWest one” and everyone started talking about the 
problems people had been having.

‘Me and Dominic didn’t have a clue. We’d been so busy with the wedding that we hadn’t watched the TV much or seen the news.

‘We rang the bank and were told that 
the money would show in the account on Tuesday, so we went ahead and 
made the booking because there would have been more than enough to cover
the honeymoon.’

Apologetic NatWest bosses hand-delivered the missing £1,000 to the couple’s home in cash.

But Kimberley said: ‘I appreciate they were trying to make a gesture, but it felt like too little too late.’

The couple are now trying to book a 
last-minute break before Kimberley has to return to work on July 8, yet 
face paying an extra £400 if they still want to go to Rhodes.

A NatWest spokesman said: ‘Our local CEO Tracy Tonry has spoken to Kimberley and personally delivered cash to her.

‘We are very sorry for the impact on our customers and urge them to call in at their branch.’

Millions of customers were unable to 
view an up-to-date balance, make payments such as direct debits for 
bills and receive their wages following a software update last Tuesday.

The bank said in a statement: 
'Technical issues have caused considerable disruption to many of our 
retail and business customers, as well as customers of other banks. We 
have made significant progress in resolving the issues and are working 
around the clock to put things right for our customers.

The Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) warned that it could be weeks before customers see all of the issues completely resolved.

The banking group had extended its 
opening hours during the week as staff worked 'round the clock' to sort 
out the problems, which began after a software update last Tuesday.

money: A mother with a baby passes a NatWest cashpoint which says 
millions have been left high and dry due to 'tecnical difficulties' in 
Olney, Buckinghamshire

People have had their house moves and 
holidays disrupted and a defendant in a court case had to spend the 
weekend in prison because the RBS computer failure prevented his bail 
money being transferred.

In a hearing with the Treasury Select 
Committee, Sir Mervyn said the Bank had been in close contact with 
management at RBS since the problem arose.

He said the issues were technical and not a reflection of funding issues at the bank, which is 80 per cent state-owned.

He added: 'Once the current 
difficulties are over, we need the Financial Services Authority to carry
out a detailed investigation to find out what went wrong - and 
importantly why it took so long to recover.'
