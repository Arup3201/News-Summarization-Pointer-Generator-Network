He's made the big screen his own in epic thrillers like Avatar, Clash of the Titans, Man on a Ledge and Terminator Salvation.

But on Wednesday, Sam Worthington took on decidedly less illustrious starring role as he arrived at court in New York to face the charge that he punched a photographer in the face on Sunday.

Worthington, 37, is accused of striking Sheng Li in the face after Li allegedly kicked Worthington's 26-year-old girlfriend, Lara Bingle.

Not his finest moment: Avatar actor Sam Worthington is pictured leaving a New York City court on Wednesday after being arrested on February 23 for allegedly punching a photographer

Serious: The 37-year-old fidgeted as he appeared in court on Monday, three days after the scuffle

Silent: Worthington stayed silent beside his attorney during the appearance on Wednesday morning

And according to TMZ, the judge not 
only charged the actor, but issued a restraining order to prevent 
Worthington having any contact with Li.

Worthington
 was charged with two two counts of 3rd degree assault, one count of 
attempted assault, one count of harassment - and faces a maximum of one 
year in jail if convicted.

He is due back in court on May 8th. After the arrest, Worthington had been issued a desk appearance ticket and was released.

Li, a 37-year-old photographer who lives in Manhattan, was held for 
arraignment; it was revealed that does not have press credentials.

 the music: Worthington claims the photographer was trying to trip up 
his partner, Lara Bingle; the Australian model didn't accompany him to 
court

Dressed in a smart navy coat, English-born Worthington, who was raised in Australia, looked less concerned by the East Coast sleet and snow than the ignominy of the situation.

The incident, which saw both Worthington and Li arrested, occurred outside the Cubbyhole bar in the West Village on Sunday at 5.30pm.

In video footage of the fracas, Worthington is seen swinging his hand towards the paparazzo, who he claims had deliberately tripped Bingle.

Model Lara can be seen watching the scuffle, which happens against the bonnet of a car.

Lara
 even gets involved as her obviously angry boyfriend steps away, 
attempting to take the camera from paparazzo Sheng Li's hand as he curls
 up on the floor.

A heated tug of war ensues, before Lara steps away.

First appearance: After the hearing Worthington was released but will be returning to court on May

History: This is Worthington's second run in with a photographer, he was arrested in Atlanta in 2012 after an argument outside a restaurant

Heading home: Worthington was swarmed by the press as he left the court on Wednesday

Video, obtained exclusively by MailOnline, shows her shouting in the heat of the moment, obviously upset.

During
 the scuffle, Worthington can clearly be heard referring to Bingle as his 
'wife', yelling at the photographer, 'you kicked my wife.'

Lara
 adds to this, shouting, 'don't touch me'. Worthington then pulls her 
away and they walk away from the scene to await the arrival of police.

The photos show police arriving and talking to Lara and Worthington, before handcuffing him and taking him away in a car.

It is said that the actor asked officers if they knew 'that movie Avatar?' as they talked in the street.

Defence
 lawyer for Li, Ron Kuby, says the Bingle lashed out at his client when he 
tried to take her picture, according to news.com.au.

Speaking
 in Manhattan Criminal Court on Monday during Li's arraignment, Kuby 
said that Worthington then approached his client and punched him in the 
face four times.

'Ms. Bingle was the one that attacked him,' Kuby said.

'She
 claims that Mr. Li was following her for four hours and then runs up 
and kicks her in the shins. In what world does that make any sense?'

However, Worthington's camp states: 'The
 defendant followed her on a public street for approximately four hours,
 kept getting in her way as she was walking down the street and was 
trying to trip her, which caused her to fear for her safety.'

MailOnline have contacted both Bingle's and Worthington's spokespeople for a comment.

This
 is Worthingtonâ€™s second run-in with a photographer - he was arrested 
and pepper sprayed in Atlanta in 2012, following an argument outside of a
 restaurant.

Are they? The scuffle fueled rumors the couple are married after Worthington called Bingle 'my wife' in the chaos. He was also pictured wearing a wedding ring to court on Wednesday
