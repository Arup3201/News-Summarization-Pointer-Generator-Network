He may be facing up to 20 years behind bars for going on a week-long crime-spree across six states with his underage girlfriend - but Dalton Hayes says he'd do it all again for the girl.

A month after Hayes and his 13-year-old girlfriend, who were dubbed 'teen Bonnie and Clyde', were arrested in Florida, he has spoken out in an exclusive jailhouse interview with Dr Phil, revealing that he still loves her and cries in jail because he misses her so much. 

And even though the 18-year-old, from Leitchfield, Kentucky, faces multiple charges including second-degree rape, the trip was worth it to make her happy, he said.

'The look in her eyes at the beach, the way she looked at me... she was the most happy girl alive,' he said in the interview, which will air on Wednesday. 'I would do it all over again to protect her.'

'Protective': Dalton Hayes, 18, has claimed that he fled Kentucky with his underage girlfriend in January because he wanted to protect her. They were found two weeks later in Florida and he remains in jail

Tough questions: Hayes spoke in an exclusive interview from his Kentucky jailhouse with Dr Phil

The girl, whom MailOnline is not naming because she is a minor, had urged Hayes to flee the state with her on January 3, claiming that she was being beaten by her family, he told Dr Phil.

He saw the bruises to back up her story, he said, and they set their sights on Panama. (The girl's father has strongly denied hurting her.)

But unfortunately for Hayes, he was supposed to be in court the following day on robbery charges - and his girlfriend, who had always told him she was 18, actually turned out to be 13. 

Even though he knows the truth now, he still loves her, he said.

'There's not a day that don't go by where I don't think about her,' he told Dr Phil. 'Two days ago I called my mom and I cried to my mom because I miss her. Some people think it's a bad thing because she's 13. I had no clue she was 13.'

Despite finding out her real age on the day they fled, he said that she was so terrified of returning home that he knew he had to do something. 

On the run: Hayes, pictured with his girlfriend, said she had told him she was 18 - but she was actually 13. He found out the truth on the day they fled, but he decided to stay with her and protect her anyway

Emotional: Hayes wiped away tears as he spoke about his love for the girl and for his parents

'I didn't have much of a plan,' Hayes said. 'The only thing I knew to do was to protect her and keep her safe and that's what I did... My first instinct is "forget about court, I'm gonna keep her safe".'

They fled and eluded authorities for more than a week, allegedly stealing three trucks - including one with two guns inside - on their drive across Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida.

In South Carolina, they were reportedly seen driving one of the stolen trucks before heading inside a Walmart where they allegedly cashed a stolen check.

While they were on the road, he never forced her to stay away from home and made sure she was well cared for, he said.

'I had not one dollar. She did not go hungry, I always fed her,' he said. 'I would let her eat before I'd even take a bite of anything.'

He repeatedly told her he wanted to go home, he said, but she said no.

'I knew we was going to get caught,' he told Dr Phil. 'I knew what I was facing. After she had told me her real age, I knew what I would come home to.

'But she thought it was all a joke. She would laugh about things. She would think every thing's funny. And it just so happens when we were arrested, not every thing's funny.'

When a passerby spotted them sleeping inside a truck in an IHOP parking lot in Panama City, Florida and recognized the duo from news reports, they were arrested - to Hayes' relief.

The young couple quickly said their goodbyes as police handcuffed them.

'She said, "Go somewhere",' he recalled. 'There was nowhere to go. So they put us both on the ground. And I told her – I said, "I love you." And she said, "I love you, too." And that was it.'

Now, he thinks about her every day, but although he admitted he made poor choices, he doesn't regret what they did because it saved her from her family, he said.

He also said that they had been engaged and, at one point she had been pregnant - which his mother disputed - but that now he has no plans to marry her.

Still, he misses her.  

Jailed: He faces multiple charges, including second-degree rape after his relationship with the girl

'If I had a chance to see her and look at her, I'd tell her that I love her, tell her that her eyes still shine brighter than the stars do - just tell her everything's going to be alright,' he said. 

'I want people out there to know that I did not do it to hurt her, I did it to keep her safe. Not only then did I love her but today I still love her.' 

Even though Hayes does not dispute all the charges, one thing he took umbrage with was being dubbed 'Bonnie and Clyde'.

'I wasn't nothing like that,' he said. 'We did not hurt nobody. We did not have no intentions of hurting anybody.'

He knows he faces between 10 and 20 years behind bars but says he is looking forward to the opportunity to turn his life around. He plans to get his GED and start college, he said.

But he became emotional as he spoke about his parents, calling himself a 'momma's boy'. His father has also been diagnosed with throat cancer and Hayes fears he will not see him again, he said.

'I really am scared my dad's not going to make it,' he said. 'That's what hurts the most.'

He also expressed remorse for the damage he had done on the crime spree, and apologized to a couple whose truck he damaged. 

A grand jury indicted Hayes on a dozen charges three weeks ago.

Among the charges, he faces up to 10 years in prison for second-degree rape, with no force. In Kentucky, a second-degree rape occurs when an adult has sex with a minor under 14, even if it's consensual.

The grand jury also indicted Hayes on two thefts that occurred in early December. He also faces custodial interference, criminal trespassing and criminal mischief charges.

Police say the 13-year-old girl will face charges in juvenile court.
