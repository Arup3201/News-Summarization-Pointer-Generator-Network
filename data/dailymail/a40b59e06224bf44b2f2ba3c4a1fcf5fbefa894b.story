A one-year-old boy has died in North Carolina after being viciously mauled by the family rottweiler in front of his five-year-old brother.

Little Nyhiem Wilfong was attacked in his grandfather's yard on Monday in Caldwell County by the 100 pound dog named Kobe.

Family members and animal control officers said that the dog was found still tied up when they arrived and they suspect that the two brothers had set the tragic chain of events off by trying to play with the dog.

Tragedy: Nyhiem Wilfong died when the family rottweiler attacked him on Monday at his grandfather's home in North Carolina

Grandfather Ervin Patterson said that he first became aware of the mauling when he heard his five-year-old grandson scream for help.

The two brothers were at their grandfather's home because their mom was out looking for a job. 

'He said, ‘Papa the dog is on the baby.’ So I jumped up off the bed and ran up there to get him.  I called 911 and tried to do CPR but I couldn't do nothing else for him,' Ervin Patterson said to WSOCTV.com

After the attack, Nyhiem's family rushed him to the bathroom after dialing 911 and when paramedics arrived they said the toddler had serious injuries to his head and chest.

'They went to the swing set and I just assumed that's where they were at because I was washing dishes,' said grandmother Shirley Patterson.

Nyhiem's great-grandmother said that the last time anyone saw the brothers they were by a swing and not the dog.

'It could have been a territorial thing. Unfortunately, and I know his sounds crazy, the dog could have been playing with the child,' said Greg Greene with Caldwell County Animal Control.

Kobe the rottweiler was taken to an animal control pound after the attack and has been quarantined.

Patterson admitted he had only owned the dog for a few weeks and doesn't know now whether the dog will be destroyed.

He said that he wanted to let other parents know never to take your eyes off your children. 

'Just watch. Just watch. That's all I can say. Watch your babies. It was an accident that's all,' Ervin said to WSOCTV.com

Sheriff’s deputies said their investigation is still ongoing in this case.
