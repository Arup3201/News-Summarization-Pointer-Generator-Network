The supercomputer that beat Jeopardy's greatest champs has now been put to use brainstorming innovative recipes to be served from an IBM food truck to customers eager for something new.

Watson already impressed visitors at a Las Vegas tech conference last week by devising recipes like Swiss-Thai asparagus quiche and Austrian chocolate burrito.

The next stop is Austin's South by Southwest Festival, where Watson will continue making odd but delicious dishes like pork belly moussaka as IBM works to fit the technology into a convenient app that anyone can use.

Supercomputer, super chef: IBM has put its famous Jeopardy champ supercomputer Watson to use whipping up cutting edge recipes for its food truck tour

IBM programmers basically tweaked Watson to make into a super sous chef, writes The Salt.

Chefs begin by inputting a main ingredient (for instance: apples) and a regional cuisine such as Eastern Europe.

Watson then flips through a nearly endless database of recipes.

Using its bank of food chemistry knowledge and, astoundingly, human tastes, Watson then pairs the main ingredient with other far less likely ingredients.

The offbeat list of ingredients Watson spits out may not always sound delicious--suggesting apples has coaxed Watson to produce the offbeat garlicky, pork loin-laced Baltic Apple Pie--but it's the taste that matters.

'It has driven up some flavor pairings
 that we would not have thought of,' James Briscione, one of the chefs 
working with Watson and IBM, told The Salt. 'But we haven't come across 
an instance yet where something didn't taste good.'

Another
 recipe devised by Watson was the pork belly moussaka, which calls for 
cottage cheese, red bell peppers, dill, pork belly and cheddar cheese.

'I said, "No freaking way! This sounds horrible,"' said Briscione.

But it tasted great. 'Everyone who tasted it had to say, "Wow."'

Pork belly apple pie, anyone? Chefs input a main ingredient and Watson pumps out a list of other ingredients that sound weird, but that science says tastes absolutely delicious

In addition to the billions or trillions of combinations Watson can come up with, having the chefs there to decide how to use the ingredients makes for even more possibilities.

'Two different chefs can get the same list of ingredients and come up with completely different dishes,' Briscione said.

The chef isn't afraid of losing his job to the supercomputer, though.

He tells The Salt that sometimes a list of ingredients will have all the best flavors but none of that all-important aspect of a great dish, texture.

'You can end up with a list of ingredients, and none of them has an element of crispiness,' he said.

IBM is showing off Watson's diverse skill sets as position themselves to make the Sueprcomputer's benefits available to businesses and individuals.

The Armonk, New York company said their new Manhattan-based business unit devoted soley to Watson will be dedicated to the development and commercialization of the project that first gained fame by defeating a pair of ‘Jeopardy!’ champions, including 74-time winner Jennings, in 2011.

In the years since Watson's TV appearance, IBM has been developing the supercomputer for more practical purposes and changed it to a cloud-based service.

Its massive computing capabilities once took a device the size of a room, but Watson is now that size of three stacked pizza boxes, according to BetaNews.

IBM says Watson is unique because it it's programed like traditional computers and uses artificial intelligence to learn from its past experiences and factor that information into its future operations.

More practical than Jeopardy: IBM has been thinking big when it comes to Watson and since its 2011 Jeopardy win against champs including Ken Jennings, they've created a Manhattan-based arm of the company specifically geared toward putting the supercomputer to use for businesses and consumers

‘IBM has transformed Watson from a quiz-show winner, into a commercial cognitive computing breakthrough that is helping businesses engage customers, healthcare organizations personalize patient care, and entrepreneurs build businesses,’ said Michael Rhodin, who will head the new Watson Group.

IBM CEO Ginni Rometty said that Watson is built for a world where big data is transforming every industry and every profession.

‘Watson does more than find the needle in the haystack,’ Rometty said in remarks released ahead of the Watston Group's unveiling. ‘It understands the haystack. It understands context.’

As part of its investment, IBM is building a new headquarters for the business on the edge of New York City's East Village near New York University and other technology companies. About $100 million will go toward investing in startup companies that are building apps to be run through Watson.
