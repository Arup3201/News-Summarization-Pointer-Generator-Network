Failing care homes will be taken over by teams of specialist troubleshooters under Government plans to end the scandal of old age abuse.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told MPs that the NHS watchdog, the Care Quality Commission, would be given the power to put care homes in special measures if they were neglecting patients.

He said: 'We must never again have a situation where the system knows there is a problem but the public don't.' Mr Hunt added: 'There are still too many where I would personally not want my mother or my father or grandparents to live in.'

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said standards in care homes were not good enough, after revealing plans for Ofsted-style inspections

Care homes will come to be seen as a quirk of the health service at the end of the last century, Simon Stevens argued

Putting hospital trusts in special measures was part of the government's response to the Mid Stafford hospital scandal in which around 1,200 people needlessly died.

An inquiry highlighted the 'appalling and unnecessary suffering of hundreds of people' at the trust and investigations revealed that many patients were left lying in their own urine and excrement for days, forced to drink water from vases and given the wrong medication.

A year ago, following a review into 14 other hospital trusts with higher than expected death rates, 11 trusts were put into special measures for a catalogue of failings and fundamental breaches of care.

This afternoon Mr Hunt said that a similar system would be rolled out into care homes and home care services. From October services across England will face a tough new inspection regime, he said.

Care homes and home care services will receive Ofsted-style ratings and those rated inadequate face being put into special measures. If they fail to make improvements they could be shut down, Mr Hunt said.

Earlier this week it was also reported that a similar regime would be rolled out for GP services.

Mr Hunt said: 'There are many excellent home care providers and many outstanding care homes in this country, but there are still too many where I would personally not want my mother or my father or grandparents to live in.

'The public have been really shocked by stories of abuse and neglect, and we need to give the public confidence that when these things happen they will be spotted quickly and acted on.'

Mr Hunt added: 'When I have had relatives go into care homes the experience has been mixed. I have had ones that I have thought were OK and I have had ones that I wasn't so happy with.

'The judgment I made as a member of the public was usually about the feeling of compassionate care that you got from the staff who worked in the institution.

'What you are not able to do as a member of the public is look with expert eyes that Andrea's team are able to do. Where this will really help is that it will give expert backbone to those judgements.'

Andrea Sutcliffe, the chief inspector of social care at the Care Quality Commission, added: 'Week in and week out people tell me and my team, or inspectors discover, truly awful care which should not be happening.

'Sometimes it's abuse, older people treated roughly or worrying bruises that have no explanation.

'Sometimes it is neglect, people living with dementia not supported to eat and drink so they end up with malnutrition or life-threatening dehydration.

'Sometimes it's a shocking lack of respect for people's dignity, dressed in someone else's clothes that don't fit, men not having a regular shave because staff are too busy, no one taking the time to find out what makes you happy or just to talk to you.

'It can all add up to a thoroughly miserable or frightening experience for people often in the most vulnerable of circumstances.

'It doesn't just affect the individual, it affects the whole family. The worst part of the letters I read sometimes is the distress and guilt that the family feel. It can be truly heartbreaking.

'Those examples of failing care reinforce my determination to make sure that we call time on poor care.'

Earlier this month the boss of the National Health Service said he would be ‘disappointed’ if nursing homes still existed in 50 years’ time.

Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said that he believes better community care and advances in dementia research can be used to help people stay in their homes.

It follows public concern about the treatment of the elderly in some care homes in recent years.

Mr Stevens likened the concept of care homes to TB beds, where patients were consigned on wards to be treated with the deadly disease.
