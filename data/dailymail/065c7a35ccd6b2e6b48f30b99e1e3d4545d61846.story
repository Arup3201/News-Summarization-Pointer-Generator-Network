Liberal Democrat Stephen Williams attacked the rule that councils had to hold a referendum if they wanted to raise council tax by more than two per cent

The Liberal Democrat’s local government minister has described his own department’s flagship policy on council tax as ‘absurd’.

Liberal Democrat Stephen Williams attacked the rule - handed down by his own Department for Communities and Local Government - that councils had to hold a referendum if they wanted to raise council tax by more than two per cent.

He also suggested that town halls should be able to impose a new ‘bedroom tax’ on hotels in tourist areas.

And in comments at a fringe event at his party’s conference in York, Mr Williams also suggested that planning Minister Nick Boles was ‘hated’ by his own party.

Mr Williams said of the coalition’s council tax policy: ‘A referendum on tax rises is absurd. If we had it for income tax, VAT, then the country would probably grind to a halt.’

He then went on to spell out his vision of giving councils powers to introduce even more taxes, saying ‘Why shouldn’t we generally provide that local government can set new taxes, possibly across a range of areas?’.

‘You could have a genuine ‘bedroom tax’ on hotels, for instance, in major tourist areas - seaside towns, and cities like York. The city council would have done very well out of us this week if there was a £1 tax on every room. That’s where I want us to get to.’

The Minister offered a bleak assessment of the impact his own Department for Communities and Local Government was having because of its cuts.

‘Some district councils, because of the fall in central Government grant, are undoubtedly going to get into severe financial difficulty - and viability questions will probably be asked over the next two to three years,’ he said.

Planning policy was ‘constantly changing’ under the coalition. ‘Nick Boles is hyperactive in that area - which is good in a way,’ Mr Williams said. ‘He’s hated by a lot of Tory MPs - but he’s quite a good colleague to work with in that he’s thoughtful, he’s creative, he knows his stuff.’

Despite his apparent disdain for the referendum trigger for council tax rises, a statement put out on the Liberal Democrats’ own website in December openly trumpets the policy as a coalition achievement.

It said: ‘The coalition has given councils the ability to freeze council tax for up to 6 years. This has helped ease the squeeze on family budgets.This has meant average family has paid £600 less in council tax since 2010.’

Mr Williams also attacked a New Homes Bonus which offered grants to councils based on the number of new houses that were built.

The Bristol West MP said: ‘The New Homes Bonus - speaking freely as a Lib Dem MP - I’m not a fan of. I don’t think it’s an incentive, necessarily, for local authorities to give planning permission. I don’t think it’s actually driving decision-making on the ground.’

Mr Williams had been speaking at a Lib Dem conference event.

A senior Lib Dem spokesman said that Mr Williams had been reprising an old policy for a tax on hotel rooms which had since been rejected by the party.

The spokesman added: ‘He was talking about his personal views and taking soundings from our councillors. He was trying to do a bit of fact-finding..He was not making any sort of government speech or a pronouncement on behalf of his department.’
