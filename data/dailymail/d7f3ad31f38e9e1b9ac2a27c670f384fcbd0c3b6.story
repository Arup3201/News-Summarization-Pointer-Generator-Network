Cat breeders have created a new type of kitty based on mythical elves and it is a dead ringer for Dobby from the Harry Potter films.

Elf Cats, which sell for $2,000 (£1,245) each, are a cross between the American Curl, known for its curved ears and the hairless Sphynx.

While cat fans have compared the animals to heartthrob Orlando Bloom's elf character Legolas from the Lord of the Rings films they perhaps bear a closer resemblance to ugly house elf Dobby from the Harry Potter series.

Karen Nelson from the United States who created the breed wanted to combine the traits of the Sphynx and the American Curl to create a cat which is a sociable, affectionate and highly active.

Karen, who suffers from cat allergies but is not affected by hairless types said: 'The Elf is full of energy and is docile and outgoing!'

Karen began the Elf Cat programme in 2007 and there are now breeders located in Arizona, California, New Jersey, Idaho, Michigan, Illinois, and Georgia.

Although officially regarded as a hairless breed some Elf Cats have a thin layer of downy fur. They need to be kept out of bright sunshine and bathed regularly to prevent skin infections.

Breed specifications state Elf Cats should be of medium to large size, weighing from 3.6kg up to 6.8kg. The curve of their ears should be between 90 up to 180 degrees. 

Karen decided to start breeding cats herself after a Sphynx cat which she had bought died from heart problems at the age of just five months.

She added: 'The American Curl is an extremely healthy breed with an amazing body structure and of course those cute curly ears.

'Using them as an outcross to our sphynx poses no harm and in the end will probably make a more healthy naked cat.'
