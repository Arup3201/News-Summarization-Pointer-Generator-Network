Plummeting at more than 60 miles per hour these amazing shots show a gannet making a beeline for its dinner just moments before it hits the water.

The incredible photographs were captured by wildlife photographer Steve Ward around 25 miles out to sea from his native Crosby on Merseyside.

A gannet dives towards the sea off the coast of Liverpool from heights of 90 metres in this shot by photographer Steve Ward, 34

The gannet is pictured just milliseconds before it hits the water. Photographer Steve Ward, 34, from Crosby on Merseyside, said it was 'lottery' shot

He said: 'A friend organised a boat trip 25 miles from Liverpool Bay and we were lucky enough to see these birds fishing.

'These birds are fast. They fall out of the sky at up to 60 miles per hour.

'The light was tricky so getting this shot just before the point of impact is a difficult one to nail especially when they dive all of a sudden from about 30 metres in the air.'

The seabird was fishing off the coast of Liverpool and emerged with a pouting fish, a relative of the cod.

Gannets
 hunt for fish by diving from heights of nearly 90 metres, allowing them
 to plunge into the depths of the sea in search of underwater prey.

Success: the gannet rises from the sea victorious having caught a pouting fish off the coast of Liverpool. Photographer Steve Ward, 34, said he was delighted with the shot

Mr Ward said: 'They really are amazing to watch fishing. I just managed to catch it before it hit the water which is the best shot and the reflection was a bonus.

'Even though my camera shoots 10 frames per second this shot is still a lottery to nail and on most attempts I ended up with just a splash shot, so I was delighted with this image.'

Gannets are the largest seabird in the North Atlantic, with a wingspan of up to two metres.Â 

Known by the phrase people use to describe gluttons as 'eating like a gannet' there is little evidence that these birds really eat this way.

Gannets hunt for fish by diving from heights of 90 metres which allows them to reach speeds up to 60mph
