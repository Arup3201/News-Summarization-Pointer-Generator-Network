Lewis Baker led England U20 to a 6-0 mauling of Romania U19 on Friday, and the Chelsea midfielder proudly donned the captain's armband throughout for the first time in his still-young career.

But who is the man that won Young Player of the Year  last season as a Chelsea youngster?

Here, Sportsmail examines the the 19-year-old and tell you all you need to know.

Potential: Lewis Baker led England U20 to a 6-0 mauling of Romania U19 on Friday in his debut at that level

BORN: Luton, April 25 1995 (age 19)

POSITION: Central midfielder

YOUTH CAREER:

2004-2005: Luton

2005-2014: Chelsea

SENIOR CAREER:

2014-NOW: Chelsea

2011-2011: England U17 (7, 1)

2013-2014: England U19 (14, 9)

2014-NOW: England U20 (1, 1) 

Who is this potential England star? 

Baker is a 19-year-old central midfielder who, having plied his trade at Luton in their centre of excellence, joined Chelsea in 2005. 

Scouts were quick to sign the then-10-year-old from the Luton academy, despite Arsenal, Aston Villa and Queens Park Rangers also lurking. It took more than just his party trick - being able to do 600 keepie-uppies in one go - to catch their attention, though.

His ability in the engine room, even at the tender age of nine, impressed Chelsea enough to fork out a four-figure sum more than 10 years ago. 

They've kept tight hold ever since, seeing off interest from Middesbrough, Bolton Wanderers, Watford and other Championship clubs, who want to take him away from Stamford Bridge on loan.

But no Chelsea youngsters get through to the first team... 

Ah, but they do. Jose Mourinho gifted Baker his senior debut in the FA Cup against Derby in January. The England hopeful came on as a late substitute for Oscar, leaving Juan Mata and Co on the bench at Pride Park, and Chelsea comfortably won 2-0.

It isn't all about the first team, though. Baker's U21 duties at Chelsea involve him acting as captain for others developing at the London club.

Baker, on his debut at U20 level, captained England and scored a penalty en route to a 6-0 win on Friday. With little else to do during the international break, Mourinho should take note.

Strike: Baker scores a penalty against Romania on Friday as he led from the front like a true captain

Star in the making: Baker is a 19-year-old central midfielder who plied his trade at Luton's centre of excellence

Celebration: Chelsea enough to fork out a four-figure sum more than 10 years ago to snap up Baker

What would I have to pay to buy him?

A pretty penny, as is the norm in football nowadays. Baker's price would likely be north of £5million, should you wish to bring him to your club. Middlesbrough, Bolton and Watford enquired about the starlet's status, but were unsuccessful in agreeing a loan deal with Chelsea.

Untested talent can be difficult to slap a price on, of course, but Chelsea insist they have no ordinary youth product on their hands here.

What's his style of play?

Frank Lampard-esque. Baker sits in the middle, overseeing almost every pocket of space the pitch has to offer. He can, though, switch to the right wing and play behind the striker if need be.

The playmaker's ability to take a free-kick with either foot leaves goalkeepers at a loss. His left-footed strike against Tottenham and his right-footed goal against Juventus are testament to his versatility. 

Proud: Baker tweeted his pleasing message about being the captain for England at the U20 level

But is there a chance he'll be a regular first team player?

That's the £5m (or so) question. Willian, Cesc Fabregas, Eden Hazard, Ramires, Andre Schurrle and more are all midfielders above Baker in the pecking order. He has his work cut out for him.

A loan spell would most likely be best for Baker to whet his appetite in the Championship or higher, but that's a point Mourinho is distinctly against. 

The Chelsea manager prefers to track Baker's progress himself in the development squad.

‘At 16 or 17 I don’t think it’s good for them to go somewhere else to play, like in the Championship,' said Mourinho. 'At 17 they have to train with us and they have to learn with us. They will learn a lot.' 

Happy, Lewis? Chelsea saw off interest from Middesbrough and Co, who want to take the midfielder on loan

Chance? Baker will try to break into the first team again but must beat a host of talented names to do so
