A gang of 24 men and women are accused of stealing more than £400,000 of taxpayers' money in a 'large-scale, organised attack' on the benefits system.

The 18 men and six women, all aged between 19 and 24, are accused of 'hijacking' the identities of members of the public before posing under fake names in order to claim Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) and Employment Support Allowance (ESA).

It is alleged some members of the group also had access to third party personal data which allowed them to pass identities onto other people.

During their first appearance in court today, it was alleged the gang, all of whom either live or work in London, worked together in a 'large-scale, organised attack' to cheat the Department of Work and Pensions out of £446,844.85 for two years.

The group appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court today charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation. The case will now be sent to Southwark Crown Court.

Andrew Penhale, Deputy Head of the CPS Specialist Fraud Division, said: 'Following an investigation by the Central Criminal Investigation Service, part of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), the CPS has authorised charges against 18 men and six women, all of whom live or work in London, in connection with alleged benefit fraud.

'On dates between July 2011 and September 2013, it is alleged that these individuals took part in a large-scale, organised attack on the DWP benefits claims and payments system, dishonestly obtaining £446,844.85 between them.

'In order to carry out this fraud, it is alleged that the defendants hijacked the identities of innocent members of the public without their knowledge or consent.

'The evidence suggests that some of the defendants had access to third party personal data before providing details to other defendants in order for them to make fraudulent claims for DWP benefits, namely Jobseekers Allowance and Employment Support Allowance.

'The 24 individuals are charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation.

'In accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors, we have determined that there is sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction and a prosecution of all the defendants is in the public interest.'

The group almost overwhelmed the court and had to be dealt with in batches, with two groups of nine entering the dock one after the other, followed by a third batch of six.

Each defendant stood
 to say their name, age and address. Only a few of the defendants had 
family sitting in the public gallery to support them.

District Judge Jackson spoke to the defendants in their three separate groups and told them: 'This is a case of obtaining benefits by fraud on a large scale between July 2011 and September 2013.

'It is a matter that has to be sent to a crown court to be tried before a judge and jury.'

The 24 defendants are due to appear for a preliminary hearing at Southwark Crown Court on August 6.

The defendants are Keon Willabus, Charles Winful, Elwyn Burland, Trishan Burland, Lance Anderson, Geshin Arowosaye, George Grant, Alan Nsowah, Makayla Minjo, Eric Nsowah, Daniel Twumasi, Bryony Morgan, John Walters, Raymond Antwi, Shalim Frank, Nana Acheampong, Cindy Liu, Denzil Amoo, Grace Tsimba-Diangituka, Hanna Bang, Jessie Mensah, Theo Wilson, Chevron Bailey, Reece McMullan.
