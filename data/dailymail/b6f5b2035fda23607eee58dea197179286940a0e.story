The men who would have defended Britain from a Nazi invasion have famously been depicted as a ragtag bunch of elder-statesmen who would have misfired and floundered as they fought.

But it appears the real truth about the Home Guard is very different, and this Dad's Army was very much a Lads' Army during the Second World War.

New documents released by the National Archive today give us the most detailed picture ever of who joined the world famous volunteer force between 1940 and 1945.

By sifting through application forms and
using a representative sample of these people, experts have found that half 
of these four million or so British soldiers were under 27, and a third 
were under 18.

Dad's Army? Forget it, new National Archive documents show around half of volunteers were in their twenties and a third were under 18

Dad's Army, regarded as one of the 
BBC's great sitcoms, was led by people like fastidious old bank manager 
Captain Mainwaring and the doddering panic-stricken butcher Lance-Corporal 
Jones.

It was based on 
the premise that the Home Guard was made up of people too old to enlist,
unless you were a 'stupid boy' like Pike, but today this has been 
almost completely debunked.

As well as age details, archived pictures of Home Front exercises, volunteer posters and some application forms have also been released.

Spot the difference: The Home Guard was much more like this troop of young men pictured in 1941

There is even a signed certificate thanking volunteers for their bravery from King George VI.

'This surprising discovery, revealed by our pilot project, has destroyed the myth that Home Guard volunteers were primarily formed of those too old to serve in the military,' William Spencer, principal military records specialist at The National Archives said.

'Perception of the Home Guard may have 
been distorted over the years, perhaps influenced by the popular TV 
comedy Dad’s Army, but now for the first time we have access to primary 
source material and a more realistic demographic analysis of the Home 
Guard has been revealed.'

The BBC produced 80 episodes and three specials of Dad's Army
between 1968 and 1977, portraying the accident-prone, disorganised
platoon which protected the fictional South East resort of
Walmington-on-Sea.

At its peak, as many as 18.5million viewers tuned in to watch
the latest mishaps of Captain Mainwaring, Sergeant Wilson,
Lance-Corporal Jones and Privates Pike, Godfrey, Walker and
Frazer.

Classic episodes include Command Decision, in which the platoon
is offered weapons by Colonel Square.

Captain Mainwaring agrees - before discovering the weapons are
muskets and his men are expected to fight on horseback.

In the Battle of Godfrey's Cottage, the platoon is ordered to
split into two sections in the event of an invasion. During
exercises, the men scramble to their positions, but begin attacking
each other in the confusion.

On patrol: Millions of men volunteered to protect Britain and it appears that many more were younger than first thought

Royal seal of approval: This is a signed thank you from the King, George VI to those who gave up their time to volunteer

The Home Guard, initially known as the ‘Local Defence Volunteers’, was an arm of the British Army consisting of millions of local volunteers otherwise ineligible for military service, usually owing to age or fitness.

It was commonly thought to have comprised mostly of men who were too old to serve in military service, yet, The National Archives pilot project has revealed that 50 per cent of the records selected for the project were of men under the age of 27, with 28 per cent of the men were aged 18 or younger.

Although this revelation is a fascinating
discovery from a historical perspective, around half of the records from
the pilot still cannot be released into the public domain because of 
data protection and the official secrets act.

The National Archive's Home Guard record series contains the enrolment forms for armed service personnel, which were completed when men joined the Home Guard.

These digital records typically contain information such as name, date and place of birth, address, date of enlistment, promotions, previous military service, and date on leaving service.

The files have been transcribed to allow the records to be searchable by key word, making this initiative a valuable resource to historians online, allowing them to locate key information easily.

Incredible: Applications to join the Home Guard also give a fascinating insight into the lives of people, including this one by Henry Watson Johnson who joined up at 53

Few army service records between 1914 and 1920 exist as many were destroyed by enemy bombing in the Second World War. Only about 40 per cent survive and the condition of these can vary greatly with some being very badly damaged.

Therefore these new Second World War records also shed light on the stories of soldiers who survived World War One and joined the Home Guard.

But these men were rewarded for their bravery with medals, rather than causing a string of embarrassing mistakes like those in the celebrated television series.

One record shows the application of Lt
Col Hereward Sprot, who had previously commanded the 6th Dragoon 
Guards, the 9th Durham, and was Colonel of 4th Durham Survey Regiment in
World War One.

Powerful: Many who were not able to join the armed forces volunteered for the Home Guard as they desperately wanted to protect Britain in the event of an invasion

Sprot 
was highly decorated, being awarded the ‘Croix de Guerre’ for his 
previous service in World War 1, and then later an OBE during his time 
in the Home Guard. He only served 1 year 130 days in the Home Guard 
before being discharged due to reaching the age limit of 65.

Sergeant
Henry Watson Johnson enlisted in the Home Guard on 3 June 1940 aged 53.
His  file contains his address and names his next of kin as his wife 
Elizabeth and on October 7 1949 he received a Defence Medal for his role
in the Home Guard.

Sgt Johnson served 4 years and 18 days with the Home Guard before being discharged to join HM Forces aged 57.

Sharpening pencils at both ends to improve efficiency, regularly jumping into forward rolls to avoid dizziness in combat situations
and drinking tea to ease the effects of a gas attack - it sounds
like an episode of Dad's Army.

But to Private Thomas Harper, pictured right, a member of the Home Guard during
the dark days when a Nazi invasion was a very real threat, anything
that could help repel the enemy was important.

Aged 31 when the Second World War broke out and unable to join
the Army, he was determined to still do his bit for King and
Country.

His anti-invasion skills were never put to the test, of course.
But a detailed, handwritten record of his service showed he was
more than ready if the Germans had ever rolled into his home town
of Derby.

The documents had been held by Private Harper's family since
his death in 1999 at the age of 91, but came to light five years ago when they decided to put them up for auction in 2007.

After studying Home
Guard manuals, pictured below, and attending lectures, Private Harper would write
down a guide to which he could always refer.

Under the heading Summaries of Duties of Sending and Receiving
Signals, he wrote: 'To make sure signals are correctly received,
keep your pencil sharpened at both ends. It will then be correctly
written down.'

Describing tactics when on patrol, he said: "By night be alert,
by day move slowly.

'We can either walk in an alert, erect manner or for sharpness,
roll. Practise rolling to avoid dizziness.

'Movement by night means silence is golden. Be careful of
silhouetting and avoid skylines. On soft ground, place your heels
down first.'

Following a lecture on gas in 1942, he noted the effects
included 'gums ache, dentures fall out'.

He went on: 'If chlorine gas is used, it will smell like bleach
and will result in choking and coughing.

'Lie flat and take plenty of internal warmth - like drinking
sweet tea.'

The father-of-one worked as a bread round driver during the war
and later became an accountant. His wife, Annie, died in 1997, aged
87.
