Pursued: Criminals who were judged to be able to repay their costs will be tracked down by the authorities

Criminals who refuse to pay their legal aid bills will have their cars seized by the government and sold.

Offenders who have been judged capable of repaying their legal costs currently owe the taxpayer more than £30million.

Officials say that, in future, convicts who do not pay up will be ruthlessly pursued by the authorities.

Cars will be seized and sold off in Government auctions.

It could see luxury cars held by criminals being flogged off to pay money back to the public purse.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: ‘Legal aid is not free - it is taxpayers’ money.

‘We must bring down the cost of legal aid and our starting point has to be that law-abiding citizens don’t foot the bill when those concerned could pay themselves.

‘I am clear - you can’t avoid paying your legal aid bill and expect to keep a fancy car on the driveway.’ The Legal Aid Agency will be able to apply to the courts for Motor Vehicle Orders from today.

A defendant facing trial at the Crown Court automatically qualifies for legal aid, provided they submit a completed application form.

Under the Crown Court Means Testing scheme, a financial assessment is then carried out to decide if the defendant should be asked to pay a contribution towards their defence costs.

If they can afford it, they will be given a repayment schedule.

Once a defendant with assets has qualified for legal aid, the Agency will be entitled to clamp any vehicles which belong to them.

After conviction, officials can then go back to court for permission to sell the car, putting money raised towards unpaid legal aid costs.

Costs: £700million a year is spent on legal aid for Crown Court cases. Just £9.6million has been recovered of the £43.6million owed

People who are cleared by the courts are
not made to repay their legal aid. Cars will be seized where guilty men
or women refuse to pay what they owe.

Some £700 million a year is spent on legal aid for Crown Court cases.

At the end of March this year, the Crown Court had recovered £9.6 million - or just 22 per cent - of the £43.6 million owed.

A string of wealthy individuals have received legal aid in the past.

They included convicted gangster Terry Adams, who got £4.7 million, and caravan park owners the Connors family, who kept homeless drug addicts and alcoholics as virtual slaves.

Eligibility: There has been a history of wealthy criminals who have received legal aid in the past, including a premier league footballer who was defending himself against accusations of spitting on an 11-year-old fan

The Connors family owned homes with hot tubs; a fleet of cars including a Rolls-Royce and a Mercedes saloon; enjoyed Caribbean cruises and holidays in Mexico and Dubai; and had £500,000 in the bank.

Yet they were still able to claim around £500,000 in legal aid.

In 2005, the millionaire former Premier League footballer El Hadji Diouf was given legal aid to defend himself against accusations of spitting at an 11-year-old fan.

Under separate changes planned by Mr Grayling, defendants living in households with a ‘disposable income’ of £37,500 or more are to be stopped from automatically accessing legal aid.

New rules designed to protect the public from aggressive bailiffs are to be introduced by ministers.Bailiffs will be banned from entering homes at night or when only children are present. They will also be banned from taking basic household items, such as a cooker, microwave, refrigerator or washing machine
