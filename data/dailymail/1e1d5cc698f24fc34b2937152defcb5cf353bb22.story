Nearly half of parents feel guilty about not reading enough bedtime  stories to their children, a study  has revealed.

Some are so embarrassed that they have lied to their friends about it.

But ‘once upon a time’ is still alive and well in most British households, with nearly nine out of ten parents setting a goal of reading to their children every night.

A recent study has revealed almost half of parents feel guilty for not reading bedtime stories to their children (posed by models)

And it appears to be on the rise, with only two thirds of those parents saying they were read to regularly as children.

The
poll of 1,200 mothers, conducted by parenting website Mumsnet, found 
that 44 per cent of parents feel bad about not treating their children 
to a tale before bed. Full of guilt, 4 per cent said they have lied 
about the amount of bedtime stories they read.

Some
eager parents have found they  are the ones most looking forward to a  
story at night, with 8 per cent admitting they have bribed their 
children just to listen to a story.

As
part of their poll, Mumsnet asked celebrities if they managed to read 
to their children. Great British Bake Off host Mary Berry revealed that 
Constance Howard’s 1920 book Ameliaranne and the Green Umbrella by 
Constance Heward were favourites of her children.

Chef Jamie Oliver revealed that his  children adore The Story of the Little Mole Who Knew it Was None of His Business.

Mother-of-two
Holly Willoughby is a fan  of The Gruffalo by Julia Donaldson, which 
was also voted the best bedtime story  by respondents.

Reading
duties are also increasingly split between husband and wife, with 45 
per cent of those polled saying they share the responsibility with their
partner.

Mumsnet co-founder Justine Roberts said: ‘It’s heartening to find that the bedtime story is alive and well.

‘It’s
a bit of quality time working parents have carved out, where they feel 
they are expanding their child’s knowledge as well  as having the 
magical moments we all wish we could have more of.’
