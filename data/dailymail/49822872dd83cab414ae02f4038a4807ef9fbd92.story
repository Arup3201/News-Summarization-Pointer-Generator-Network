The little rockhopper penguin has finally reached the top of the cliff.

It has been a bit of a struggle, all those jumps from edge to edge, all those setbacks when big waves pull him down again into the sea.

But now he can rest and let the wind ruffle the tufts of yellow feathers above his eyes.

Bird is the word: The Falkland Islands are home to an astonishing population of gentoo penguins

And behind him, in stark counterpoint to 
this everyday routine of a bird colony, rises the dramatic steel cross 
of the HMS Sheffield memorial, a reminder that just a few miles across 
these waters the destroyer was hit by an Exocet missile with the loss of
 the lives of 20 men.

It is a moment that could sum up the Falklands Islands.

For although life would have probably gone on pretty much the same for the rockhoppers and all the other wildlife creatures, it would have changed forever for the islanders had the Argentinian invasion succeeded in 1982.

Back through three decades: The memorial at Goose Green remembers the British dead of that key battle

Instead it was defeated by the Task Force which sailed 8,000 miles to achieve victory in the South Atlantic. The price was 255 British and 655 Argentine dead, with hundreds wounded on both sides.

Today in this peaceful and pristine landscape, it is hard to imagine how fiercely battle raged in places like San Carlos, Goose Green, Mount Tumbledown and the hills around the capital Stanley.

At the same time, though, you never feel far from some legacy of the war.

It is there, of course, as soon as you arrive at Mount Pleasant airport and its adjoining military base, where 1300 servicemen and women are stationed to guarantee the security of this overseas territory.

It is there
 in the discreet little leaflet you are handed at immigration reminding 
visitors in English and Spanish not to remove anything from battlefields
 or display any Argentine flags.

And
 it is certainly there in the minefields which still border the main 
road - although they are now all clearly marked and cordoned off.

Light and breezy: Port Stanley is full of colourful houses which give it a bright complexion

In Stanley, there is a fine official memorial. But perhaps even more touching is the special wood with a tree planted for every British life lost. In San Carlos, there is the British cemetery which commemorates not just those buried there but their comrades who died at sea.

In the Argentinian cemetery in Darwin, there are rows of white crosses, more than half of them for conscripts who were not given dog tags, marked Soldado Argentino Solo Conocido Por Dios – known only unto God. It is almost impossible not to be moved by these places.

Families from both sides come to the islands, as do veterans - not only to pay their respects to the fallen, but sometimes also to seek comfort for themselves.

You can see how consolation might be found here.

The
 beauty of the Falklands lies not in its scenery - which, apart from its
 ‘stone runs’ - dramatic cascades of huge rocks sweeping down the 
hillsides - is generally pretty bleak and unexciting.

Feathered friends: The islands are home to over 200 bird species, including adorable geese

Instead it is to be found in the coastal crags and the lovely beaches, in the clear ever-changing light and in the surrounding waters, dark navy in one spot, Caribbean turquoise in another.

Then there is the wildlife: seals, sealions, dolphins, orca, even a passing whale if you are lucky. And thousands and thousands of birds from 200 species, including five kinds of penguin.

And this is birdwatching made easy - no hanging about for hours in hides or endlessly fiddling with binoculars. Upland geese leisurely cross the road in front of your car. Albatross chicks let you stand within a few feet without batting an eyelid.

One day I had a couple of caracara hawks playing ‘Grandmother’s footsteps’ behind me, tailing me down a hillside, freezing when I stopped and turned - and then following me again when I moved.

If you sit patiently in certain areas, curious young gentoo penguins will waddle up to peck your bootlace or even nibble at an outstretched hand.

Shards of the old world: Port Stanley plays host to Christ Church Cathedral (left), and even red phone boxes

At times it seems the wildlife is actually competing for your attention. On a choppy but exhilarating boat crossing to West Point Island we spotted dozens of albatross, petrels and cormorants in a great feeding and fishing frenzy. And just as I was gawping at this spectacle, a school of dolphins appeared, swooping under the boat and leaping out of the water.

It was as if they were all claiming ‘Look at me’, ‘No look at me’, ‘No coo-ee, over here please’.

West Point was my only boat trip, as most inter-island travel is done by plane - for the simple reason that the Falklands archipelago is the size of Wales, and that getting from Stanley in the east to, say, Carcass Island in the west, might be a 50-minute flight with stop-offs as residents return to their far flung ‘settlements’, home from a shopping trip or a family party, or a Saturday-night date in Stanley.

On one flight, I am the only passenger in the ten-seater Britten Norman Islander plane.

Echoes of Britain: Port Stanley holds ties to North Yorkshire via a twinning relationship with Whitby

So I sit up front and chat to Eddie the pilot, who tells me: 'People see the islands as a speck on an atlas. So when they get here, they’re amazed at the scale.'

Normally white-knuckled at the slightest bump of turbulence, I am astounded at just how much I enjoy these flights - skimming over the water at a couple of hundred feet on one; soaring above the clouds on another; taking off from a grass airstrip from which a cow has just been shooed; watching my hosts put up a windsock and radio a visibility report to the pilot.

Taking the air route: Many journeys between the islands are flown by little Britten-Norman aircraft

Almost everything about the Falklands could be described as hardy: the planes, the all-terrain vehicles, the vegetation, the sheep, the wildlife. The same goes for the people: resourceful, resilient, often doing two jobs, sometimes a little reserved initially, but eventually warm and welcoming.

And although on some days the wind can whip up from the Antarctic and penetrate five layers of clothing, there is no shortage of home comforts and good food. The upland goose pate is delicious, the squid some of the best I’ve ever tasted and the baking for ‘Smoko’ – once a break for sheep shearers, now another word for elevenses – could have held its own at any W.I. fair.

There are around 2,500 islanders now, the majority living in Stanley, which has brightly painted houses, a promenade, a fine cathedral and several lively cafes and pubs with signs in the window saying ‘Heroes Welcome Here’. It feels rather like an old-style English seaside town.

A shadow still falls: Minefields still exist in the Falklands - though they are carefully marked

Despite its fervent patriotism – only three people voted no in last year’s referendum about staying British – it would be a mistake to think of the place as an isolated ‘Little Britain’.

Economic success with fishing licences and the discovery of oil mean that, at the last count, there were 60 different nationalities on the islands.

Even in ‘Camp’ - the word for everywhere outside Stanley - you will be guaranteed as fascinating a conversation with your hosts as with your fellow guests.
