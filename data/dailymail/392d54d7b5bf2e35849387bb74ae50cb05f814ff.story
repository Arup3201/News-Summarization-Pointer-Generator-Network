Supporters are now calling for the daily pill to be made available on the NHS

Sexual health campaigners have urged healthcare workers to consider offering a HIV prevention pill to healthy individuals who are at substantial risk of infection.

The guidelines, issued by the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Public Health Service, involve the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP, when at-risk individuals take a daily dose of the drug to reduce their risk of HIV infection.

Supporters are now calling for the daily pill to be made available on the NHS. 

A trial is already taking place in Brighton to see whether PrEP will lead to a reduction in the use of condoms and its impact on the spread of other sexually transmitted diseases. 

The two-year PROUD trial involves 550 gay men and it is hoped it will convince authorities in the UK to introduce the drug on the NHS. 

The idea builds on a landmark 2010 study that found Gilead Sciences Inc's Truvada - a pill already widely used to treat the human immunodeficiency virus - was more than 90 per cent effective at preventing HIV infections among test subjects who took the drug as prescribed.

According to the new guidelines, healthcare providers should consider PrEP for anyone who meets specific risk criteria, such as being in a relationship with an HIV-infected partner or having sex without condoms with partners known to be at risk for HIV, such as injecting drug users.

The guidelines offer the first comprehensive guidance from the CDC.

But critics have warned the pill could lead to complacency around condom use.

Yusef Azad, director of policy at the National Aids Trust, told The Independent: 'Before we get it on the NHS, which is what I think we should have, we should make sure through the PROUD trial that we're confident about some of these unanswered questions.'

In 2011, there were 6,280 new diagnoses of HIV in the UK. At the end of 2011, around 96,000 people were living with HIV.

It is estimated that around a quarter of people who have HIV don't know that they have it.Of the 6,280 new cases of HIV in 2011, around 48% were infected through heterosexual sex, and 48% through sex between men.

HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) attacks the body’s immune system (our natural defence against infection and disease). 

In late-stage HIV infection, also known as AIDS, the weakened immune system means the body is more vulnerable to life-threatening conditions such as pneumonia and cancer.

The virus is passed on through exchanging bodily fluids such as semen, blood, or vaginal secretions.

The CDC now estimates as many as 275,000 uninfected gay men and 140,000 heterosexual couples, in which one partner is HIV-infected, could benefit from PrEP.

Some 1.2 million people in the United States live with HIV, and new infections are estimated at 50,000 each year.
