An air steward who has spent £125,000 on plastic surgery in a bid to turn himself into a real-life Ken doll has become the first person in the UK to have stem cell hair treatment.

Rodrigo Alves, 30, has undergone 20 cosmetic procedures including nose jobs, liposuction, six-pack and pec implants, calf shaping and botox fillers.

But that, it seems, is not enough for Mr Alves who recently had his 21st cosmetic treatment - a pioneering form of stem cell surgery that claims to fix baldness.

Vain: Rodrigo Alves, 30, has undergone 20 cosmetic procedures including nose jobs, liposuction, six-pack and pec implants, calf shaping and botox fillers and now he's had the first-ever stem cell treatment in the UK to grow his hair back

The  flight attendant is the first person in the UK to have the procedure, which saw doctors inject stem cells into his scalp.

The procedure took just four hours and now, two months on, Mr Alves says he is seeing the first results.

Mr Alves, who lives in London, said: 'I started seeing results after two months. I have lots of baby hair coming through - it’s amazing.

'My hair was really thin and my temple was starting to recede but now it's coming back in leaps and bounds.

High tech: The flight attendant became the first person in the UK to undergo the procedure, which saw doctors inject stem cells into his scalp by taking fat from his back and mixing it with his blood

One step closer to his ideal: He said that before the treatment, his hair was really thin and his temple were starting to recede but now it's 'coming back in leaps and bounds'

'Seeing my hair begin to go like that was quite shocking. I was considering going to LA to have a transplant until I found these doctors. I’m getting so many compliments now.

'The main results are on my temple. I don't have a receding line anymore, I'm really happy with it all. It was well worth it.'

Mr Alves' £5,100 ($8,000) procedure, which took place in Miami, began with liposuction on his back to extract fat cells.

Doctors then took 500ml of his blood and blended the two in a special machine before injecting the mixture into his scalp.

Intricate process: The operation involved him having liposuction in his back to extract fat cells before doctors took 500ml of his blood and mixed the two together in a special machine for a number of hours to extract the stem cells, which was then injected back into his scalp

The latest treatment is Mr Alves' 21st and he has had 12 major operations, eight smaller cosmetic procedures and spent more than £125,000 since the age of 20.

His long list of surgery includes splashing out £8,000 on botox and fillers, £30,000 on three nose jobs, £3,000 on liposuction to his jaw and £10,000 on pec implants.

He has also spent £22,000 on a fake six-pack, £7,000 on fillers to his arms, £7,000 on hospital bills, £7,000 on laser lipo, £6,000 on leg lipo and £3,000 on calf shaping.

He also indulges in twice-yearly Botox and filler top-ups and takes a cocktail of daily pills consisting of collagen tablets, anti-water retention and hair growth tablets.

Mr Alves said he 'admires' Barbie’s boyfriend Ken - because the toy looks like the 'ideal man'.

He decided to go under the knife for the first time in 2004 after struggling with the way he looked since childhood.

Cosmetic fan: Brazilian-born Rodrigo has had 12 major operations, eight smaller cosmetic procedures and spent more than £125,000 since the age of 20, including Botox and fillers

As he grew older, Mr Alves realised he didn’t have to put up with his looks - and had his first operation when he moved to London.

'I just want to present myself in a way I have always wanted to,' he said. 'Cosmetic surgery has really changed my life, it was a positive makeover for me. If it wasn’t for cosmetic surgery then I wouldn’t be the man I am today.

'I’m not trying to reach perfection, I’m just trying to be the best that my body allows me to be. I’m more confident now, I’m better looking and able to present myself in a different way.'

But his attempt at perfection nearly cost him him life when a Brazilian doctor injected a gel into his arms to make them look more muscly.

The 30-year-old was then struck down by a major infection which left him paralysed and unable to feed or wash himself.

After three weeks in hospital with the support of friends and family, he recovered and flew back to the UK.

'I am constantly researching for the best treatments and cosmetic procedures that can make me look better and stop the ageing process,' he added.

'I also still use a laser hair comb and many different vitamins and creams in other to improve the skin and hair condition.

'Thankfully we live in a very modern high-tech society and I believe that now science meet technology and both meet beauty which can be beneficial to many people. It is a constant maintenance process.

'I receive lots and lots of emails and messages on Facebook from people around the world asking for beauty and cosmetic advice.

'I want to set an example of positive makeover and break the taboo about cosmetic surgery.'

Forward-thinking: He says that thankfully we live in a very modern high-tech society and he believes that now science meet technology and both meet beauty, which can be beneficial to many people
