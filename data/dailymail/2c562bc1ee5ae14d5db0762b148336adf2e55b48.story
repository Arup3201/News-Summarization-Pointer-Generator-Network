When Ebay was founded in 1995, it's unlikely that the company's creator Pierre Omidyar foresaw how big it would become. 

The site is now used for people all over the world to sell their wares, from cars and vintage clothing to holiday homes and artwork. 

But the latest offering is enough to raise even the most hardened Ebay buyer's eyebrows - a woman is trying to sell her imaginary friend. 

Georgia Horrocks put her imaginary friend Bernard up for sale on Ebay the advice of her psychiatrist. The 22-year-old Londoner is pictured here having a dinner date with her pal 

Georgia's friend Bernard has a starting bid of 99 pence on the website  

Georgia Horrocks from London put her invisible buddy Bernard on the market with a starting bid of 99 pence.

The 22-year-old decided to make the sale on the advice of her psychiatrist. 

She wrote in a humorous post: 'I have recently come to the decision that it is time to sell my Imaginary friend Bernard who was created during a time of emotional instability. 

'My psychiatrist recommended that I say goodbye to Bernard, and although I would like some financial compensation it is more important that he finds a good home.' 

Bernard's condition is described as 'Very Good', and Georgia goes on to describe her friend's health in more detail. 

She wrote: 'Physically, Bernard is in very good health.'

She continued: 'He is very active and has made me get out of bed to exercise on many a morning - very useful if you're looking to loose a few pounds.' 

Unsurprisingly, there are no hidden postage costs after the auction has ended. 

Georgia said: 'Bernard obviously will not be sent via post but will be sent via my imagination to the winning bidder's side.'
