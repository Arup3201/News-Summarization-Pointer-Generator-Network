Treadmills for $33? Computer monitors for $9? High-tech $600 projectors slashed to $8.85?

If you thought the deals advertised on Walmart's website this morning were too good to be true, it turns out you were right.

A 'technical error' on the retail giant's website caused certain products to be priced absurdly low, causing an online shopping frenzy.

What a deal! Walmart caused an online shopping frenzy on Wednesday morning after a technical glitch slashed prices on numerous items by hundreds of dollars

Work in progress: Walmart said the website was up and running at 11am Wednesday, but acknowledged there may be some problems through the day

Walmart reportedly got the site working again about 11am, but admitted there would intermittent availability problems throughout the day.

'We experienced a technical 
error that caused some items to show incorrect pricing,' Ravi Jariwala, a spokesman for Walmart's online operations, said.

'We apologize for
any inconvenience to our customers.

'I want to make very clear this is not a hack. This is an internal technical error.'

As customers inundated social media sites such as Twitter with news of the sales, products sold out online in just hours.

Tell them they're dreaming: Walmart products sold out in hours after a technical glitch slashed prices online

What a steal! Walmart was selling digital projectors worth $600 for as little as $8.85

The country's largest retailer was 
selling a 24-inch high definition Viewsonic computer monitor, an InFocus
IN2124 Projector digital projectors and other products for about $8.85.

The projector is listed for $578.89 on Walmart.com and $579.99 on 
Newegg.com, according to ABC News.

Meanwhile, Jariwala declined to comment on whether 
it would honor the bargains which customers scooped up and said Walmart was 'still 
working through the details'.

Just two weeks ago, Walmart stores in Louisiana experienced another frenzied shopping day after a computer glitch gave consumers unlimited funds on their government-issued credit cards. The retailer was forced to foot the bill.

Heading
into the crucial holiday shopping season, Walmart has doubled the 
number of items it has on its website from last year to five million.

That's
expected to help fuel a 30 percent growth in online sales to $10 
billion for its current fiscal year, which ends in late January.

That's still just a sliver of the $486 billion in annual sales Walnart did last year.
