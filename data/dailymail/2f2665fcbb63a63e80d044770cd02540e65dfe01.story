Mo Farah’s training set-up is under urgent review after it emerged he was training alongside a convicted doper.

British Athletics have admitted to The Mail On Sunday that they have been using a coach heavily connected with a drugs cheat to organise the double Olympic champion’s trip to Ethiopia and provide running partners for his sessions.

Jama Aden, described as an ‘unofficial facilitator’ to the governing body during Farah’s seven-week stay in the high altitude town of Sululta earlier this year, provided athletes, including former world junior 1500m champion Hamza Driouch, to train with Farah.

Driouch, 20 is currently serving a two-year IAAF ban for irregularities in his biological passport, which date back to August 2, 2012, when he was being trained by Aden. The ban began on New Year’s Eve but was only made public last week.

Aden was Driouch’s coach intermittently since 2011 but he denies knowingly allowing a doper to train alongside Britain’s most decorated and celebrated track star.

British Athletics’ performance director Neil Black and head of endurance Barry Fudge were with Farah in Ethiopia but also deny knowing who Driouch was.

A British Athletics spokeswoman said: ‘We have already sought assurances and Jama states that he didn’t hear of the ban until over a week after Driouch’s departure [from Ethiopia] about the ban relating to his blood passport and is obviously very unhappy about the situation.

‘Of course we will be looking into it further, but that’s what we know right now. Neil and Barry were not concerned by anything while out there. It’s too early to say it’s raised concerns but understandably they will review the whole set-up.’

While there is no suggestion that Farah is involved in any wrongdoing, it is another damaging blow to his image just a week after he was involved in an unseemly Twitter spat with Great Britain team-mate and rival Andy Vernon.

The IAAF are likely to investigate why Driouch, who was born in Morocco but competes for Qatar, was partaking in formal training at all, apparently contravening rules which state banned athletes are prohibited from ‘participating in any capacity... in a training camp, exhibition or practice’.

Although Farah, who won Olympic golds at 5,000m and 10,000m in London in 2012, will not face any action from the IAAF, he could be embroiled in any investigation as a witness.

Farah’s camp made an attempt to distance themselves from Driouch, claiming he did not even know who he was running alongside much of the time and implying Driouch had ‘jumped in’ on his session.

Several pictures later emerged showing them running, travelling back from the track and dining together but a source close to Farah said: ‘He is so focused on his training that he often doesn’t know the identity of other athletes around him.’

Allowances do have to be made for the cultural differences between training in the UK or US and in East Africa, where things are more relaxed and young children and animals often run alongside elite athletes on the trails.

But those charged with protecting Farah’s clean image surely have to take more care about the background of athletes he is being exposed to, even if they could not reasonably be expected to know about Driouch’s ban.

There will be awkward questioins for Aden, given that Driouch was only 17 when the abnormalities in his biological passport first occured. Many will want to know who he got performance enhancing substances from.

British Athletics came under fire in 2013 for sanctioning Farah to have a training session with controversial sprint coach John Smith., who led Maurice Greene to 100m gold in Sydney in 2000, but was named in official documents connected to the BALCO drugs scandal that brought down Dwain Chambers and Marion Jones.
