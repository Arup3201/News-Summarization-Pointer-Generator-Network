Charley Hoffman survived a wayward tee-shot on the final hole to win his third PGA Tour title at the OHL Classic at Mayakoba in Mexico.

Hoffman finished 17 under par and won by one stroke from Shawn Stefani after New Zealand's Danny Lee, whose seven successive birdies on the front nine was the longest streak of the tour season, faded on the inward half.

But the 37-year-old American had to do it the hard way after hitting a tree with his final drive, forcing him to hack out left-handed.

Two good shots set up a tap-in bogey and his compatriot Stefani could do no better, having left his own tee-shot up against the face of a bunker.  

Hoffman's win at the El Camaleon course is his third career PGA title and his first victory in four years

Hoffman's five-under-par round of 66 was blemish-free up until that point, with four birdies on the front nine taking him firmly into contention having started three strokes behind overnight leader Jason Bohn.

He then pitched to two feet to set up birdie on the par-five 13th and saw a wonderful approach at 15 roll just past the right of the hole and a foot through - bringing him another birdie - and even his struggles down the last could not prevent him clinching the title.

Hoffman told pgatour.com: 'I was behind a little bit but I kept hitting good shots and giving myself chances.

'Obviously Danny must have made a couple of bogeys coming down the stretch but I just kept hitting fairways and hitting good irons.

'The 13th was the momentum turner - Shawn's in the fairway and I fan mine out right, but I end up making birdie and he makes bogey.'

He had no regrets over not playing safe at the last.

He said: 'That's driver all day for me, I've got 290 (yards) to carry to take out the bunker. I just pulled it slightly too much and got real unlucky ending up next to the base of a tree.' 

A two-under 69 saw Stefani remain in second, where he started the round, while Lee shared third with Andres Gonzales.

The 24-year-old Lee had moved into the lead after his blistering front nine. A solid putt at the sixth earned him his fourth successive birdie and he followed it up with a superb three-wood onto the green at the par-five seventh and well-judged irons to the next two greens.

Lee said: 'I'm happy with where I finished. The back nine on this golf course is very tough and you have to hit perfect shots to make birdies, which I didn't do.'

Jerry Kelly was fifth on 14 under, Brice Garnett was a further shot back and Bohn joined Tony Finau at 12 under after a closing 74 featuring three bogeys and a double.
