A hockey fan took a puck to the face during a Sunday game - but the sports lover says it was worth it after she stayed to watch her team win. 

Tricia Drummond was watching a game between the Washington Capitals and the Philadelphia Flyers at the weekend when the puck flew above the safety glass surrounding the rink and cracked her in the head.

Ms Drummond appeared to be knocked unconscious by the blow and was bleeding from the head.

She was hit in the face three minutes before the end of the game.

A team doctor with the Flyers took care of her, giving the woman five stitches to close the wound.

The dedicated fan decided to stick out the rest of the game and was rewarded when her team the Capitals came from behind to win the game 5-4 in a shootout.

Ms Drummond later tweeted a picture of her bloody temple and wrote: 'I took 5 stitches for the team and they won. It's worth it.'

However it appears despite her painful blow, Ms Drummond did not go home with the puck. 

Despite receiving five stitches, the dedicated fan stayed rink side to watch her team win the game
