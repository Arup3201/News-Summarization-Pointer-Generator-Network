Five-star hotels pride themselves on offering cordon bleu food and personal service, but a hotel in Japan may offer a glimpse of the future, because it will be staffed almost entirely by helpful humanoids.

When the first guests check into at Henn-na Hotel in Nagasaki this July, they will be greeted by 10 eerily lifelike robots - and the mechanical service will not stop there.

The robots will check in new guests before carrying their luggage and cleaning their rooms – and all with a smile.

A hotel opening in Japan this summer will be staffed by helpful humanoids. The first guests check into at Henn-na Hotal in Nagasaki this July, they will be greeted by 10 eerily lifelike robots, like this one.

They will come from a company called Kokoro, which has been developing 'actroid' or human-seeking robots, for just over a decade, The Telegraph reported. 

The robots are designed to look like and share the mannerisms as polite young Japanese women.

They will look like they are really breathing, blink and make eye contact as well as altering their body language and tone to respond to guests’ requests. Their cloth uniform also makes them look more human.

Claims made by an expert in artificial intelligence predict that in less than five years, office jobs will disappear completely to the point where machines will replace humans.

The idea that robots will one day be able to do all low-skilled jobs is not new, but Andrew Anderson from UK artificial intelligence company, Celaton, said the pace of advance is much faster than originally thought.

AI, for example, can carry out labour intensive clerical tasks quickly and automatically, while the latest models are also capable of making decisions traditionally made by humans.

‘The fact that a machine can not only carry out these tasks, but constantly learn how to do it better and faster, means clerical workers are no longer needed in the vast quantities they once were,' Mr Anderson said.

For example, a machine can recognise duplicate insurance claims by knowing it has seen a phone number or an address before.

The robots will be multilingual and able to speak fluent Japanese, Chinese, Korean and English.

Three of the uniformed robots will man the reception desk, another four will act as porters, while others will clean.

An industrial robot will serve as a cloak room attendant.

While human staff will be on hand to make sure everything runs smoothly in the hotel, company president Hideo Sawada said that he hopes the robots will carry out 90 per cent of tasks in the hotel. 

He told the Japan Times: ‘We will make the most efficient hotel in the world.’

Guests staying at the hotel, which is located at Huis Ten Bosch theme park in Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan, won’t need any room keys, because the doors will be fitted with face recognition technology, allowing them to access their rooms using their appearance alone.

The temperature of their rooms will be monitored with technology that detects body heat and guests will be able to call for robotic room service using a tablet instead of a phone.

The hotel, which means ‘change’ or ‘strange’ in Japanese, is set to open its doors on 17 July and has 72 rooms. It is set in a theme park that is modelled on a quaint Dutch town.

A single room will cost from £40 (¥7,000) per night and a twin room will cost from £50 (¥9,000).

However, people will be able to bid for rooms online, so the cost will likely rise if the project proves popular. 

It is thought prices will be capped to match the theme park's most expensive rooms, which cost around £166 (¥30,000).

While the Henn-na will be Japan’s first hotel run by robots, androids are already working in shops and restaurants.

A club called The Robot Restaurant in Tokyo is known for its sci-fi cabaret show, featuring robotic boxers and dancers, as well as its garishly illuminated interior.

And humanoids called Nao will begin working at branches of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group from April, on a trial basis.

If the trial is successful, the robotic employees will be rolled out to more branches of the Japanese bank by 2020.

The days of laboriously sorting through clothes and loading the washing machine may soon be a chore of the past, because there's a robot that can do your washing for you.

Scientists from the University of California-Berkeley and University of Massachusetts have developed software that enables the robot to perform the complex set of tasks.

The PR2 robot has a Microsoft Kinect sensor attached so it can 'see' dirty clothes, put them in a washing basket and load them into a machine, Motherboard reported. 

After the wash cycle is complete, PR2 also folds clothes, but at the moment is unable to unload the wet clothes and hang them up.

At the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, in Austin, Texas, last month, the scientists explained that the task is difficult for robots because they have to adjust their grasp to pick up different clothes and work their way through a pile.

While their bot works out a single manoeuvre in less than on second, it takes around 15 minutes to load a washing machine.

Nao has two cameras mounted on its head that act as eyes and microphones for ears. The 1ft 11in (58cm) bot also has touch sensors, can speak 19 languages and is able to read and respond to emotions, by analysing facial expressions using embedded software called NAOqi. 

During a presentation in Tokyo last week, Nao welcomed customers to the bank, and asked which service they required.

A total of 1,000 'Pepper' robots are already working across home appliance stores in Japan, where they help customers looking for a Nespresso coffee machine.

Equipped with the latest voice and emotion recognition technology, Pepper is able to read people's facial expressions and listen to their tone of voice to analyse how they're feeling.

Artificial Intelligence has been described as a threat that could be 'more dangerous than nukes'.

Now a group of scientists and entrepreneurs, including Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, have signed an open letter promising to ensure AI research benefits humanity.

Stark warning: Professor Stephen Hawking says we must be vigilant about artificial intelligence

The letter warns that without safeguards on intelligent machines, mankind could be heading for a dark future. 

The document, drafted by the Future of Life Institute, said scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind.

The authors say there is a 'broad consensus' that AI research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society.

It highlights speech recognition, image analysis, driverless cars, translation and robot motion as having benefited from the research.

'The potential benefits are huge, since everything that civilisation has to offer is a product of human intelligence; we cannot predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools AI may provide, but the eradication of disease and poverty are not unfathomable,' the authors write.

But it issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of AI had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak.

For instance, in the short term, it claims AI may put millions of people out of work.

In the long term, it could have the potential to play out like a fictional dystopias in which intelligence greater than humans could begin acting against their programming.
