A range of much-loved British literary classics are being celebrated in London, with 50 illustrated benches shaped like open books popping up around the capital's landmarks.

BookBenches celebrating iconic favourites such as Peter Pan, 1984 and Bridget Jones's Diary are on display at various locations.

They are part of the Books about Town exhibition from the National Literacy Trust aimed at raising funds to celebrate reading.

The Trust, which reported new 
research revealing that children’s enjoyment of reading has increased 
for the first time in eight years, tasked a number of artists to create 
the benches including Cartoonist Ralph Steadman and How To Train Your 
Dragon creator Cressida Cowell.

Old master: This BookBench pays tribute to playwright William Shakespeare and can be found near the Millenium Bridge

Please look after this bear: A BookBench celebrating Michael Bond's famous series of children's books about Paddington Bear can be found on the event's Riverside Trail near London Bridge

P L Travers' classic tale about magical nanny Mary Poppins, which was made into both a 1964 Disney film starring Julie Andrews and a 2004 stage musical, is also included in the top 50 BookBenches

Timeless: A colourful tribute to children's classic Peter Pan by Scottish novelist J M Barrie, which was made into several films including the 1953 Disney adaptation

American writer Theodore Seuss Geisel earns a spot in the 50 famous books with his famous series of children's books

Stormbreaker: The Alex Rider spy novels for children by Anthony Horowitz were adapted into both a 2006 film and video game

Ms
 Cowell, known for illustrating her own books, said: 'I am so excited to
 have designed a How to Train Your Dragon book bench and to be part of 
the National Literacy Trust's Books about Town campaign to celebrate the
 wealth of writing and illustrating talent in this country.

'I am hoping Books about Town will remind Londoners on the streets of the joy of reading books.'

Meanwhile
 Mr Steadman, who illustrated Lewis Caroll's children's classic Through 
the Looking-Glass in 1973, has reproduced some of these illustrations 
for one of the seats while Lauren Child has designed a bench based on 
her Clarice Bean series.

Other
 books featured in the 50 range from the likes of treasured children's 
stories such as The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe to adult titles 
including The Day of the Triffids.

Well-loved
 literary heroes such as Sherlock Holmes, James Bond, Mary Poppins and 
Hercule Poirot also appear on benches which visitors can discover by 
following literary trails in Greenwich, City of London, Riverside and 
Bloomsbury until mid-September.

Then
 on October 7 the BookBenches will be auctioned at the Southbank Centre 
to raise valuable funds for the National Literacy Trust to tackle 
illiteracy in deprived communities across Britain.

Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows, telling the delightful story of Toad, Mole, Ratty and Badger, is featured on this BookBench next to the Bank of England

Several characters from Jacqueline Wilson's children's book series feature on this BookBench by St Paul's cathedral
