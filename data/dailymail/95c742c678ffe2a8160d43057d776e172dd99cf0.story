A giant bull seal became an uninvited guest for a newlywed couple when it stranded them on a remote island - for four days.

It clambered into the inflatable dinghy of Eddie Stebbings and his bride Bee Bueche and refused to move out.

The couple used the boat to reach the mainland three miles away as they studied the colony of Atlantic grey seals on Skomer island off the Pembrokeshire coast.

Taking it easy: The giant bull seal made itself at home in a newlywed couple's dinghy on remote Skomer island, stranding them for four days

After marrying in August, Eddie, 35, 
and 36-year-old Bee have spent the past three months on the island as 
wildlife wardens observing the seals in the pupping season.

Eddie
said: 'One morning in October the seal flopped itself into the boat. It
refused to budge for four days and was at one point joined by another 
seal.

'He was about four times my weight, eight foot long and clearly not worried about people coming close to him.'

The couple shared their honeymoon with over 400 adult seals - saving 108 baby seals after the cow seals gave birth on the pebble beach and in the island's caves.

Trapped: Newlyweds Eddie and Bee couldn't get to the mainland three miles away because the seal had moved into their dinghy

Eddie told the Daily Express: 'It's 
been an interesting start to married life for us. They [seals] are joy 
to watch but we try not to interfere with them too much - we have to let
nature take its course.

'We
have been out with them every day  - even when that hurricane blew up 
we were checking on them. Skomer is only a small island so 180 baby 
seals is a lot to keep an eye on.'

Eddie had to abseil down 200ft cliffs to study the pups which he had marked with a special waterproof dye to identify them.

He rescued one pup from a cave after the young mammal become trapped on a ledge while the couple saw other baby seals abandoned by their parents and left to starve.

Home comfort: The seal basks in the dinghy and refused to budge for four days

Eddie said: 'We have seen nature in all its glory but some times it can be quite cruel'

German-born Bee said: 'When they are very young their calls are a bit like human babies but I tried not to get too emotionally involved.

'But I ended up giving one or two of them names.'

The couple have now left the island - one of Britain's most important bird sanctuarys -  to write reports of their seal and bird study.

A spokeswoman for the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales which manages Skomer said: 'The island is in good hands with Eddie and Bee - they are dedicated to its wildlife and have fallen in love with its seals.'
