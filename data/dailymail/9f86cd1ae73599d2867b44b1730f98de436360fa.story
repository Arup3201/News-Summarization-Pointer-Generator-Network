Wayne Rooney is confident of becoming England’s all-time top scorer and believes that Sir Bobby Charlton’s record is there for the taking.

Rooney is England’s fourth-highest goalscorer on 41; three behind Jimmy Greaves, seven behind Gary Lineker and eight away from Charlton’s 49.

Rooney, who is still only 28, lines up as captain against San Marino at Wembley on Thursday night. He said: ‘It’s there for me to overtake them all. I feel I’m capable of doing that. That would be a huge honour. Until I’ve beaten the record, and hopefully I’ll do that, I’ve never thought I have to do that.

‘I’m confident in myself and believe I will do it, but the game against San Marino is more important than me scoring four or five.’

Sir Bobby Charlton - 49 goals, 106 caps

Gary Lineker - 48 goals, 80 caps

Jimmy Greaves - 44 goals, 57 caps

Wayne Rooney - 41 goals, 97 caps  

England’s opponents in their next two Euro 2016 qualifiers, at home to San Marino on Thursday evening and away to Estonia on Sunday, should provide ample opportunity for him to get on the scoresheet.

It is 11 years since Rooney scored his first goal for England, in a 2-1 win in Macedonia which made him the youngest player to score for the national team at 17 years and 317 days.

‘I’d never have thought when I came into this England team that I would be top goalscorer,’ Rooney added. ‘It would be massive for me and make my family proud. I want to do it. But for a footballer, you’re in this game for your team-mates. There’s nothing better than winning a trophy.’

The Manchester United skipper is given his marching orders after his kick on West Ham's Stewart Downing

Rooney’s captaincy credentials were called into question when he was sent off for kicking West Ham’s Stewart Downing last week. Rooney insisted it was not malicious, and that he mistimed a challenge trying to stop a counter-attack. ‘I’ve grown up in the last couple of years,’ he said.

‘I’ve made errors in the past. I came into the football world as a young lad, and you’re going to make mistakes. The older you get, the wiser you get. You mature. I’m in a comfortable position now.’

Meanwhile, Roy Hodgson believes England could win all their qualifiers. He said: ‘It would be nice to go through this campaign unbeaten. If we get two good results [this week], we’ll target winning all the games.’
