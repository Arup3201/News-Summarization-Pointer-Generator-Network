Their so-called health benefits have made them a favourite with a raft of trendy celebrities.

But if you’ve joined the hordes of runners queuing up to buy Vibram fivefingers shoes, you may be disappointed.

Makers of the distinctive trainers may be forced to pay out compensation to customers after admitting that they do not have any scientifically proven health benefits.

Celebrity fans of the trainers include Matt Bellamy. They were introduced in 2005 and rapidly grew to account for 2 per cent of all trainer sales - with other brands including Nike and Adidas creating similar styles

The shoes, with their unusual fivetoed design, were marketed as a way of preventing common runner’s injuries.

Celebrity fans include actresses Scarlett Johansson, Kristen Stewart and Kate Hudson, as well as rowing champion James Cracknell.

Vibram’s website read last week: ‘Imagine footwear that can actually help make the foot healthier, that can strengthen muscles in the feet and lower legs, improve range of motion and increase sensory reception important to balance and agility.

But the company has been forced to withdraw the claim of health benefits, after an American consumer, Valerie Bezdek, brought a law suit against the company in March 2012 in Massachusetts, where it has its headquarters

‘Imagine footwear that might just make running safer and healthier, by encouraging a forefoot strike and a more natural running form that creates less impact on the knees, hips and lower back. That is what Vibram FiveFingers can offer.

‘The benefits of running barefoot have long been supported by scientific research.

‘And there is ample evidence that training without shoes allows you to run faster and farther with fewer injuries.’

Vibram, which was founded 75 years ago to make hiking boots, began making specialised ultralight shoes in 2005.

As part of the £2.2million settlement the firm has now agreed to remove claims that the shoes are effective in strengthening muscles or reducing injury.

‘Vibram will not make…any claims that FiveFingers footwear are effective in strengthening muscles or preventing injury unless that representation is true, nonmisleading and is supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence,’ the federal settlement says.

The settlement agreement is subject to court approval, but customers who submit claims could receive $20 to $50 (£12 to £30) in compensation.
