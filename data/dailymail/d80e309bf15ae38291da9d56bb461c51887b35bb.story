A five-week-old girl was found unharmed in the wreckage of a car  after a motorway crash that killed  her mother.

Farmer’s wife Joanna Bull was taking her baby to visit relatives when her car collided with a lorry.

Mrs Bull, 29, died but her daughter Ruby was rescued from the twisted metal of the green Peugeot 406.

Joanna Bull died in a car crash on the M40 near Bicester, Oxfordshire. Her newborn baby Ruby was found unscathed lying next to the body of her mother by emergency services

She was airlifted to hospital as a 
precaution but was completely unscathed. Mrs Bull’s devastated widower 
Dave is now caring for their daughter.

The lorry driver is not thought to have needed hospital treatment.

Mrs
 Bull, known to friends as Jo, married only a year ago. After Ruby was 
born Mr Bull described the baby on Facebook as ‘an amazing anniversary 
present  from my gorgeous wife’.

Following
 Friday’s tragedy on the M40 near Bicester in Oxfordshire Mrs Bull’s 
family  said in a statement: ‘Jo was vibrant, beautiful and caring in so
 many ways.

‘A girl who added zest to a room and who had found true love and happiness with her husband of just one year, Dave.

‘Jo
 was a loving wife, mum, daughter, sister, granddaughter, niece and 
friend to so many and loved by all who knew her. To have her taken from 
her family at such a happy time is utterly unbearable.

'She died on her way to visit her mum 
Teresa, with her five-week-old daughter Ruby, to meet newborn cousin 
Harry for the first time, and to have a catch up with big sister Soph, 
and niece Nelly aged two.

‘Jo,
 we never had the chance to say a proper goodbye, but we will never 
forget how much fun and laughter you brought into all our lives, you 
will remain in our hearts and memories always.’

Mrs
 Bull, from Kenilworth, Warwickshire, had been taking Ruby to see her 
own mother, Teresa, and to introduce the baby to her three-day-old 
cousin Harry in Oxford when the accident happened.

The baby who will never know her mother: Ruby, five weeks, survived the car crash that killer her mother

An
 animal science graduate, Mrs Bull bred sheep and cattle at the farm she
 ran with her husband near picturesque Kenilworth Castle.

She also ran a day care and boarding home for dogs from the farm.

On
 the website for her company, Animal Tracks, Mrs Bull wrote: ‘After a 
childhood of working with animals I went to university to study for a 
BSc in animal science.

‘Since
 university I have travelled extensively to Australia, southeast Asia 
and  Zimbabwe. During my travels I worked on ranches mustering sheep and
 cattle on horseback and volunteering on horseback safari tours.

‘Upon
 my return from travelling I worked for the Guide Dogs for the Blind 
Association. It was during this time when I met my husband Dave at the 
local young farmers club. Dave is a farmer and between us we rent a 
traditional livestock farm where we breed both cattle and sheep.’

The
 crash in which Mrs Bull died happened near junction 9 of the M40  which
 was closed for several hours, causing huge tailbacks.

The Oxfordshire coroner is expected to open and adjourn an inquest. Thames Valley Police are investigating the accident.

The family were travelling to Warwickshire on the M40 (pictured) to visit Joanna's family for the first time after Ruby's birth. The 29-year-old's family paid tribute to 'beautiful and vibrant' Jo
