The three women who survived their decade-long captivity in Ariel Castro's Cleveland House of Horrors shared a stage together in public for the first time on Monday night.

Amanda Berry, 27, Gina DeJesus, 24, and Michelle Knight, 33, were honored by Ohio Governor John Kasich at his annual courage awards - where they received a two-minute standing ovation.

Kasich called the women's story one of hurt beyond imagination, but also a story that didn't end there.

'It is also a story of three women who found an inner strength and a courage that brought them through and sustained them,' Kasich said near the end of his annual State of the State speech.

'No one rescued them, they rescued themselves-first by staying strong and by sticking together, and then by literally breaking out into freedom.'

The women were rescued in May after 
being kidnapped by Ariel Castro from the streets of Cleveland between 
2002 and 2004 at the ages of 14, 16 and 21.

Knight, Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus escaped when Berry pushed out a door and yelled for help.

She told a police dispatcher in a dramatic 911 call: 'Help me. I'm Amanda Berry. I've been kidnapped, and I've been missing for 10 years, and I'm, I'm here, I'm free now.'

Castro pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison. He hanged himself on September 3, just weeks into his sentence.

The award presentation nearly overshadowed Kasich's speech given the women's popularity since their release.

They were household names in Cleveland for years as missing persons, and their discovery electrified a community accustomed to bleaker outcomes.

Kasich hugged the three women as he entered the hall before his speech and pictures of that moment quickly flew across cyberspace.

As he announced the awards, Kasich called them 'three extraordinary women, who despite having the worst in this world thrown at them, rose above it and emerged not as victims, but as victors.'

The three women then walked onto the stage to be embraced by the governor and receive their medals.

The audience stood and cheered in raptures for more than two minutes, the longest ovation of the night.

together in public. Berry, De Jesus and Knight made their first 
prerecorded appearances in July of 2013

'Is that just unbelievable,' a clearly moved Kasich said to GOP House Speaker William Batchelder and GOP Senate President Keith Faber, who were also on stage. 'Wow.'

While the three women have appeared in public since they escaped their decade in sickening captivity, this is their first appearance since they released a joint video in July to thank all their supporters.

Indeed, that video marked the first public appearance of Michelle Knight. It was not even known that she had been kidnapped until she was found in Castro's home on Seymour Avenue on May 6.

The video, which is three and a half minutes long, was posted on YouTube and revealed the women to have physically recovered well from their ordeal.

Back in July, Kathy Joseph, an attorney for Knight, said in a statement that the three women wanted to 'say thank you to people from Cleveland and across the world, now that two months have passed.'

She said they're being recognized in public, 'so they decided to put voices and faces to their heartfelt messages.'

James Wooley, attorney for Berry and DeJesus, also issued a statement at the time saying Knight and his clients thank people for the privacy they've been given and do not want to discuss their case with the news media or anyone else.

Following that revelatory joint prerecorded video, Knight made a brave and defiant appearance at Castro's sentencing in August in which she told him, 'I spent 11 years in hell, your hell is just beginning.'

Knight was the only one of Ariel Castro's three victims to appear in person. Gina DeJesus and Amanda Berry's victim impact statements were read by members of their family.

The 33-year-old described how the days turned into weeks, weeks into eternity and said when she was 'dying' from the abuse she suffered, her friendship with Gina was the only thing that kept her going.

Michelle Knight spoke of Castro's hypocrisy as he attended church every week and then came home to torture them.

'I remember all the times you came home talking about what everyone else was doing wrong when you were doing the same thing,' she said.

'I cried every night. I was so alone. I worried what would happen to me and the other girls every day.'

Speaking of her 'teammate' Gina, she said: 'She never let me fall, I never let her fall. She nursed me back to health when I was dying from her abuse. My friendship with her is the only good thing to come out of this situation.

'I will overcome all this that happened. I will live on, you will die a little every day,' she said to him. 'I will forgive you, but I will never forget.'

And only five days after Castro's death in September, Knight was also seen to attend a Cleveland Browns football game in September for the opening NFL game of the season.

Harrowing: In November, Michelle Knight gave an interview to Dr. Phil in which she went into distressing detail about the torture that she endured at the hands of Ariel Castro

In late July, Amanda Berry was spotted on stage at a very public concert for rapper Nelly - walking onÂ  with her family and waving at the cheering crowd before reemerging later again to join rapper Nelly.

The announcer called for 'a bigger round of applause and cheer...than any of the acts that are here' and said after she arrived on stage: 'I told her she had a little bit of time to make up on the partying and you guys could help her out tonight'.

Rapper Nelly introduced her onstage later saying: 'Everyone, here's Amanda Berry'.

Gina DeJesus' public outings have been rarer - around the same time that Berry was spotted at the Cleveland concert, she took part in the annual Puerto Rican Parade and Latino Fest in the same city.

Riding in a car along the parade route, Gina smiled and thanked her supporters by throwing candy treats to the crowd during in late July.

And in the most harrowing appearance since they escaped Castro's clutches, Michelle Knight spoke to Dr. Phil in an exclusive interview in November during which she described being 'tied up by my feet and neck like a fish'.

After Knight recounted the daily torture ordeal she went through over the course of a decade, a visibily affected Dr. Phil called the interview his most difficult.

Dr Phil said the interview 'changed him like no other in 12 years of doing the show.'
