Art lovers can see the Royal Academy’s latest blockbuster without the crowds – but only by paying double the price.

Demand to see the first major show of Edouard Manet’s portraits in the UK when it opens in London on Saturday is sky high.

So, for twice the regular price of £15, the Academy is offering ‘exclusive’ Sunday evening openings to enjoy the 19th century masterpieces in relative peace.

Such is the demand for the Royal Academy exhibition that organisers are offering 'exclusive' Sunday evening opening times

The £30 tickets, available in March and April, include a drink and audio guide.

The Academy has also put on extra tickets and extended opening to 11pm on Fridays and Saturdays to meet demand for the exhibition, Manet: Portraying Life.

One of the 50-plus exhibits, The Amazon from 1875 featuring a woman on horseback, still had not arrived yesterday from a museum in Brazil.

The exhibition opens on Saturday but some key paintings have yet to arrive having been held up by the snow

It has been held up by the snow at Heathrow but Academy bosses promised it would be on display in time for the opening.

Important
characters from the artist’s personal life feature in the exhibition, 
which showcases his pioneering technique of blurring the lines between 
portraiture and genre painting.

One blonde young man who features in several works could be Manet’s secret son, critics have claimed.

The truth behind the paternity of Leon-Edouard Koella Leenhoff - the son of the woman Manet later married - is shrouded in mystery.

But he appears in more paintings by the artist than any other male model, including five displayed at the exhibition.

In The Luncheon - described as one of the ‘most exciting’ paintings in the show - Leon is depicted wearing a straw boater looking towards the viewer.

The Manets were a comfortable, middle class family living in Paris when 19-year-old Dutch pianist Suzanne Leenhoff, became a piano teacher to Manet’s younger brother Eugene in1849.

She is thought to have had relationships with both 17-year-old Manet and his father, the judge Auguste Manet, and gave birth to her only son, Leon, in 1852.
