The mystery surrounding the disappearance of two friends that has baffled police deepened when their clothes were discovered on the rocks of a small island off the coast of Maine yesterday.

Zachary Wells, 21, and Prescott Wright, 23, were last seen hanging out at a home in the seaside community on Thursday, police chief Craig Sanford said.

The breakthrough in one of the strangest cases police have seen came when authorities discovered the clothing, including one item that was marked to indicate that it belonged to one of the men said Sanford.

The disappearance of the two friends baffled authorities, who have searched by air, water and in wooded areas for the men.

Wells and Wright are students at The Landing School in Arundel, Maine., where they were learning boat building and yacht design.

When the men failed to show up for classes on Thursday and Friday, administrators at the school contacted police.

Authorities found no signs of a 
disturbance at the home, Sanford said, and searches of the nearby area 
did not turn up any clues.

Only one of the men owns a vehicle, and it remained parked in the driveway of the house.

'There's no one area to pinpoint 
because we don't know where they might have gone,' said Sanford, calling
it one of the strangest cases he has ever seen.

Both men were expected to head to their home states for the holidays

Zachary
Wells, and Prescott Wright, were last seen drinking beer at Wells' home
in Kennebunkport, Maine around midnight on Wednesday.

But when one of Wells' roommates went downstairs to turn off a radio at 4am, neither man was there.

When they did not turn up for classes at The
Landing School - where they were learning boat building and yacht 
design - in Arundel on Thursday and Friday, administrators called the 
police.

Nothing indicates foul play, Police Chief Craig Sanford said, and searches of ocean waters, roadsides and marshy areas have failed to turn up any clues on their whereabouts.

'There's no one area to pinpoint because we don't know where they might have gone,' he said, adding that the disappearance is one of the strangest cases he's seen.

Authorities found no signs of a 
disturbance at the home. One of the men owns a vehicle but it 
remained parked in the driveway of the house. Witnesses said the men appeared drunk.

Robert DeColfmacker, president of the Landing School, told the Portland Press Herald that Wells' roommates said the two men had left their cellphones and wallets at the home.

'These are two students without a history of disappearing or unexplained absences,' he said.

On Sunday, a 
Warden Service airplane searched from the air and the Maine Marine 
Patrol and members of Well's and Wright's families searched on the 
ground, Sanford said.

Sanford said authorities do not know when or 
how Prescott and Wells left the home but assume they left together.

'We have no idea how they left, or why,' he said. 'The whole thing is perplexing to us.'

He added that they had searched the nearby water due to its proximity to the home and had no 'hard facts' that suggested had actually gone there.

The friends were supposed to be 
returning to their home states for the holidays. Wells is from 
Burlington, Vermont, while Wright comes from Barnstable, Massachusetts.

Wright's
family have not commented on the disappearance, but Wells' father, Jim 
Wells, told the Press Herald that everyone he has met in Maine has been 
helpful.

'I have nothing to add other than to say [Zachary] is a great kid,' he said.

Wells is white, 5ft 8, around 150 pounds with black 
hair, hazel eyes and a surgical scar on his neck.

Wright is white, 6ft 4, around 200 pounds with brown hair and blue eyes.

Anyone with information is asked to call the Kennebunkport Police Department at 207-967-2454.
