An emotional Lance Armstrong was close to tears when he spoke about the impact of his drug cheating on his family during the second part of his exclusive interview with Oprah Winfrey last night.

Speaking about his 13-year-old son Luke, the oldest of his five children, Armstrong said: ‘I saw my son defending me and saying, “That's not true. What you're saying about my dad is not true,'" Armstrong recalled.

‘That's when I knew I had to tell him.’

Critics said Armstrong hadn't been contrite enough in the first half of the interview, but on Friday night he seemed to lose his composure when Winfrey zeroed in on the emotional drama involving his personal life.

‘What did you say?’ Winfrey asked.

‘I said, "Listen, there's been a lot of questions about your dad. My career. Whether I doped or did not dope. I've always denied that and I've always been ruthless and defiant about that. You guys have seen that. That's probably why you trusted me on it." Which makes it even sicker,’ Armstrong said.

‘And uh, I told Luke, I said,’ and here Armstrong paused for a long time to collect himself, ‘I said, "Don't defend me anymore. Don't.'"

'If anyone says anything to you, do not defend me. Just say my dad said he was sorry'.

'He said "look, I love you, you're my dad, this won't change that".

'Thank God he's more like Kristin (Armstrong's first wife and Luke's mother).'

Armstrong also confirmed he has been undergoing therapy to deal with his demons.

Winfrey also drew Armstrong out on 
his ex-wife, Kristin, whom he claimed knew just enough about both the 
doping and lying to ask him to stop. He credited her with making him 
promise that his comeback in 2009 would be drug-free.

'She said to me, "You can do it under one condition: That you never cross that line again,'" Armstrong recalled.

'The line of drugs?' Winfrey asked.

'Yes. And I said, "You've got a deal,'" he replied. 'And I never would have betrayed that with her.'

Armstrong also told Oprah that he 
believes he should be given the opportunity to compete again, saying: 'I
deserve to be punished. I'm not sure that I deserve a death penalty.'

Armstrong was competing in triathlons, mountain bike events and marathons before he was sanctioned and believes he deserves that opportunity in the future, suggesting a life ban is not right.

He told Oprah Winfrey in the second part of their television interview: 'I can't lie to you. I'd love the opportunity to be able to compete, but that isn't the reason that I'm doing this.

'Frankly, this might not be the most popular answer, but I think I deserve it (to be able to compete again).'

Armstrong said his lowest moment was having to cut ties with his charity which he described as like a 'sixth child' to him

In hindsight Armstrong says he wishes he had 
co-operated with the United States Anti-Doping Agency investigation 
which proved his downfall. Co-operation could have meant a lesser 
penalty.

Armstrong's 
long-time sponsors including Nike and Anheuser Busch deserted him in quick succession following the 
publication of the USADA report, something he described as a '$75-million dollar day.'

The Oprah Winfrey Network insisted Armstrong did not receive a fee for the interview and was not offered one. Yet money is a concern after his sponsors departed. His admission has exposed him to numerous lawsuits, too.

'I've lost all future income,' he said.

'I don't like thinking about it, but that was a $75 million day. Gone. And probably never coming back.'

However he said his most challenging moment was 
when his own Lance Armstrong Foundation, the charity known now as 
Livestrong, distanced itself from him.

'The
foundation is like my sixth child and to make that decision, and to 
step aside, was big,' said Armstrong, who expressed his wish the charity
can thrive without being associated with him.

'I wouldn't at all say [I was] forced out, told to leave. I was aware of the pressure.

'It was the best thing for our organization, but it hurt like hell. That was the lowest [moment].'

Asked if he feels disgraced, Armstrong said: "Of course, but I also feel humbled. I feel ashamed. This is ugly stuff.'

Armstrong admitted he felt disgraced, humbled and ashamed by his actions

Armstrong ended the interview by admitting he had betrayed the people who 'supported me and believed in me'

Winfrey 
also quizzed him about the photo he tweeted last November in 
which he was surrounded by his seven tainted Tour de France winning yellow jerseys.

The
infamous photo was tweeted by Armstrong, along with the message: 
'Back in Austin and just layin' around...' not long after he was 
stripped off his seven titles by U.S. Anti-doping Agency (USADA) for 
using performance-enhancing drugs.

‘Was it just you being your cocky arrogant self?’ asked Oprah. Armstrong admitted that it had been  an act of defiance. 'And you know what's scary I actually thought it was a good idea at the time.'

Armstrong also denied claims he attempted to make a payment to USADA.

He said: 'I had no knowledge of that, but I've asked around. I think the
claim was 250,000 dollars. That's a lot of money. I would know. That is
not true.'

Armstrong says he returned to cycling in 2009 and 2010 having agreed not
to use performance-enhancing drugs again, yet evidence in the USADA 
report points to the contrary. He maintains the last time he doped was 
during his 2005 Tour de France win.

Winfrey asked Armstrong 'Did anyone know the whole truth?' He replied 'Yeah,' but there was no follow-up to ascertain who.

So was there a moral to his story?

'I
can look at what I did,' he said. 'Cheating to win bike races, lying 
about it, bullying people. Of course, you're not supposed to do those 
things. That's what we teach our children.'

Armstrong paused to compose himself before a final mea culpa.

'I
just think it was about the ride and losing myself, getting caught up 
in that, and doing all those things along the way that enabled that,' he
said. 'The ultimate crime is, uh, is the betrayal of those people that 
supported me and believed in me.

'They got lied to.'

Thursday night's interview had been the first time that Armstrong had publicly confessed to doping.

Sheryl knew: The singer was previously silent over former fiance's doping scandal

One question that wasn't answered is how much  former fiancée Sheryl Crow knew about Armstrong's use of performance-enhancing drugs?

Crow, 50, started dating Armstrong in 2003, before getting engaged in 2005 and splitting the following year.

The American singer was with Armstrong, 41, during the time that he won two of his Tour de France victories.

In September last year Crow told Katie
Couric how she found it difficult watching her former fiance stripped 
of his titles.

She said: 'I felt bad. I felt bad for him, I felt bad for his family and I 
kinda felt like the rest of America... He is a hero that we 
watched and looked up to and admired.'

Crow is yet to pass comment on Lance's admissions on national television.

The New York Daily News reported that 
she was interviewed by federal agents in late 2011, before he was 
stripped of his titles for using and distributing performance-enhancing 
drugs the following year.

Meanwhile the Wall Street Journal spoke to two separate sources who claimed Crow knew a lot about the doping scandal.
