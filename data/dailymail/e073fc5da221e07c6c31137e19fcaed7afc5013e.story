Standing shoulder-to-shoulder for seven hours, more than 100 firefighters braved intense heat to preserve one of Britain’s most iconic buildings.

The inferno that engulfed the Glasgow School of Art completely destroyed its world-famous library designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh.

But astonishingly, much of the artwork and priceless interiors survived due to the heroics of the firefighters who formed a human shield on every floor.

Taken away: Glasgow School of Art staff work alongside the fire brigade and Historic Scotland as they try to salvage any art works they can from inside the burnt-out Charles Rennie Mackintosh building

Fire: The inferno that engulfed the Glasgow School of Art completely destroyed its world-famous library

Protection: Much of the artwork and priceless interiors survived due to the heroics of the firefighters who formed a human shield on every floor

Heroics: The firefighters' efforts were crucial to the entire operation and saved millions of pounds worth of artworks

They succeeded in containing the blaze
 to the West Wing of the A-listed building by forming several lines 
between the inferno and the unaffected sections of the school.

Firefighters were sent to the same spot on each floor and formed a line to contain the fire from within with hoses.

Another was in the same position on the roof and together they succeeded in forming a firebreak.

Under
 instruction from curators, a second wave of firefighters went into the 
building time and again, to remove artefacts after being shown 
photographs and told where to find them.

As a result, the Mackintosh Lecture Theatre and Museum were saved, as were the Mackintosh archive and furniture collection.

Hopes: Fire investigators remained at the scene with officials from Historic Scotland sifting through the ashes in search of surviving artefacts

Preparation: Despite the complexity of the building, fire crews knew every detail of the interior due to years of planning

Rescue: The Mackintosh Lecture Theatre and Museum were saved,  as were the Mackintosh archive and furniture collection

Carried away: Work to install a bespoke fire prevention system had been due to restart within days, the Glasgow School of Art revealed yesterday

The firefighters’ efforts were crucial to the entire operation and saved millions of pounds worth of artworks.

'We
 were all acutely aware of the building’s heritage and how much it is 
loved by the people of Scotland, so we had a duty to preserve as much as
 we could'

David Goodhew, Assistant Chief Fire Officer

Yesterday,
 senior officers at Cowcaddens Fire Station described the battle to save
 the building. Initially, two people were reported missing, so 
firefighters were sent to search.

But once it was established they were safe, a rearguard operation to stop the blaze spreading and save the artefacts began.

Assistant
 Chief Fire Officer David Goodhew said: ‘It is always difficult fighting
 a fire in a Grade 1-listed buildings as the priority is always to try 
and preserve the structure.

‘The Art School was always going to present us with a challenge and we knew it would be a hugely complex challenge.  

Better safety: A state-of-the-art suppression system in the Mackintosh building was scheduled for completion by the end of summer

Taking care: The salvage operation continued, with the sight of each surviving treasure greeted with delight

Valuable: Concerns had previously been raised over fire safety issues within the historic building, especially as it had so many priceless works of art

Reconstruction: It has been confirmed replica studios will be built so students' degree projects can be reproduced exactly as they were before the fire

‘It is not a building designed with 
fire safety in mind and the things that  make it so attractive, like the
 wooden panels, offer firefighters a significant challenge.

'The bravery of the crews involved was just remarkable. They never flinched'

Paul Tanzilli, Area Commander

‘We
 decided to fight it from the inside very quickly and although sending 
people into a burning building is a risk, there are some operations that
 require extra risks – and the Art School is one of them.

‘We
 were all acutely aware of the building’s heritage and how much it is 
loved by the people of Scotland, so we had a duty to preserve as much as
 we could.’

Yesterday, fire
 investigators remained at the scene with officials from Historic 
Scotland sifting through the ashes  in search of surviving artefacts.

Top effort: Standing shoulder-to-shoulder for seven hours, more than 100 firefighters braved intense heat to preserve one of Britain's most iconic buildings

Emergency services: Firefighters were sent to the same spot on each floor and formed a line to contain the fire from within with hoses

Saved: Ninety-five per cent of the building's exterior, and more than 70 per cent of the interior, were saved by the efforts of the firefighters

Help: Under instruction from curators during the blaze, a second wave of firefighters went into the building time and again, to remove artefacts after being shown photographs and told where to find them

Despite the complexity of the building, fire crews knew every detail of the interior due to years of planning.

The GSA is listed as a top priority in terms of firefighting and senior officers have spent years building a 3-D profile, so they knew exactly where to go.

Area Commander Paul Tanzilli said: ‘There was more a risk with this one, but we immediately decided to set up a human shield to contain the fire to the West Wing.

‘The bravery of the crews involved was just remarkable. They never flinched.’

Group Commander Iain Goodlet said: ‘I had a quick look inside to assess where the fire had taken hold and then ordered the firefighters in.

‘It was a question of getting the right resources in terms of staff and equipment and containing the blaze.

'When you are dealing with a building of such historic importance it is always more difficult.’

Work to install a bespoke fire prevention system had been due to restart within days, the Glasgow School of Art has revealed.

A state-of-the-art suppression  system in the Mackintosh building was scheduled for completion by the end of summer.

Attempts to install it had to be halted last year after workmen discovered asbestos in the A-listed structure. Work had to be abandoned as students were due to return to their studies and could not be put at risk.

Up in flames: Firefighters tackle a blaze at the iconic Charles Rennie Mackintosh building last Friday

Yesterday, the school confirmed it had raised the funding for the fire suppression project through the generosity of donations from art lovers around the world.

The tailor-made scheme had been designed to help extinguish any blaze within a matter of minutes, although a spokesman admitted it was ‘tragically ironic’ given Friday’s blaze.

She insisted there was no way of knowing if the new system would have ultimately made a difference and prevented the spread of the fire.

It is understood the new system would not have involved sprinklers, for fear they could have been  accidentally set off, posing an even greater threat from water damage.

Blaze: Fire crews tackle a major fire at the Glasgow School of Art. The school stated that everyone in the building escaped to safety and there were no reports of any casualties

Concerns had previously been raised over fire safety issues within the historic building, especially as it had so many priceless works of art.

Art impresario Richard Demarco said: ‘Having spent £55million on a new building, they should have spent whatever it takes to get a sprinkler system in the Mackintosh building before now.

‘Every square inch should have been safeguarded and it’s inexcusable if penny-pinching got in its way.’

It has been confirmed replica studios will be built so students’ degree projects can be reproduced exactly as they were before the fire.

Artist and former GSA student Peter Graham arrived at the scene yesterday with a gold covered book to gather the thoughts of those affected by the events. Anyone wishing to offer help can do so here.
