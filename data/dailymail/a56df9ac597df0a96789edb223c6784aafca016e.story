The cousin of a four-year-old girl whose body was dumped in a picnic cooler beside a Manhattan highway 22 years ago has pleaded not guilty to her murder - despite claims he has already confessed.

Kitchen worker Conrado Juarez, 52, denied killing Anjelica Castillo. Until this year she was known only as Baby Hope.

And his attorney Michael Croce said a supposedly 'coercive' confession, in which Juarez is said to have admitted having sex with her and smothering her with a pillow, is 'completely suspect'.

Conrado Juarez, 52, during his arraignment hearing on October 12. Prosecutors say he sexually assaulted his four-year-old cousin Anjelica Castillo, known for 22 years as 'Baby Hope', and smothered her with a pillow

Naked and tied with rope, Anjelica's 
body was found beside a highway in Washington Heights, New York, in 1991.

There was
semen on her body, assistant district attorney Melissa Mourges told a 
judge.

For more than two decades, detectives did not even know her name. They nicknamed her Baby 
Hope and paid for her headstone at St Raymond's Cemetery in the Bronx.

Only when the NYPD renewed its appeal in July, on the 22nd anniversary of her death, did investigators find her mother.

She told them she had left Anjelica and another daughter with their biological father on the night she died.

Authorities say he then left them with relatives in an apartment where Juarez was also staying.

Identified: Last week Anjelica Catillo's headstone in the Bronx was finally given her name, 22 years later

Cold case: There were many appeals over the years by investigators but leads in the Baby Hope case dried up

Last week the headstone was finally engraved 
with Anjelica Castillo's name as her mother left flowers and lit candles in her memory. She would have been 26.

Juarez's reaction when detectives arrived on October 11 was: 'What is this about?', prosecutors said.

Over the next 14 hours, Ms Mourges said he first told detectives he had helped his sister dispose of the cooler, unaware of what was inside.

Then he recounted finding Anjelica dead on the floor, it is alleged, packing her body into the cooler, piling soda cans on top to try to conceal the body and helping his sister drop it by the highway.

Later, Juarez recounted sexually abusing the child while drunk but said that was unrelated to her death, prosecutors said.

'Finally, he admitted that he had sex with the victim and killed her by smothering her with a pillow,' Ms Mourges said.

The district attorney's office has not released Juarez's eventual written and videotaped statements. Prosecutors are also awaiting DNA test results.

Juarez's attorney Mr Croce has declined to describe his client's version of events.

Blessing: dozens of people - including police who investigated the case for years - showed up to bless the newly engraved tombstone in the Bronx last week. It was nameless for 22 years

Monster: Authorities say Castillo's cousin Conrado Juarez sexually assaulted her before suffocating her and leaving her body on the side of a highway. He has denied this saying a confession was 'coerced'

Speaking as Anjelica's tombstone was re-engraved last week, her sister Lorena Castillo told NBC New York: 'I'm just glad that her name is on her stone.'

Father Rudy Gonzalez, who presided over the ceremony, blessed the grave site, telling mourners, 'Bless the engraving of Anjelica's name and bless any child who at this moment may be suffering at the hands of evil hearts.'

Authorities canvassed the Washington 
Heights neighborhood in July with flyers with a sketch of the mystery girl to find new leads.

Just a day after they reopened the case, a call came into Crime 
Stoppers - the NYPD's tip line - from a person who claimed to have 
information about the case.

The
caller 'gave specific family members, where to look -- ethnicity, 
origin, approximate dates of birth, and she turned out to be right,' detective Elena Donnell said.

That tip led to the arrest of 52-year-old Juarez, who is a cousin on Anjelica's father's side.

Juarez recently gave a jailhouse interview to the New York Times claiming that he didn't actually kill the girl, but he did help dispose of the body.

He told the paper that Anjelica and her sister, Maribel, had been living with him and his sister in their 
Astoria, Queens, apartment.

One
day, the girls' father never came home, and Juarez said he and his 
sister - who has since died - were then tasked with caring for the 
girls.

Never forgotten: Police reopened the 'Baby Hope' case this year, which led to the discovery of the girl's identity

'Like garbage': Castillo's body was found dumped on the side of a highway inside a cooler

'I told my sister: ‘'You should get some kind of receipt,’” Juárez said. 'Even if it’s not notarized or formally prepared by a lawyer, get the real mother to sign something. You are going to be the one raising those girls.’

Juarez claimed his sister called him one day on his cell phone and told him that Anjelica had fallen down the stairs and that she needed help getting rid of the body.

As the Times notes, fewer than three-percent of Americans had cell phones in 1992 - when the alleged murder was committed - and the probability of a poor, immigrant kitchen worker being amongst those with a cell phone is beyond slim.

In his confession, however, authorities say Juarez admitted to things that only the killer would know.

They say he sexually assaulted the girl in his apartment then smothered her with a pillow when she wouldn't stop crying. He then stuffed her lifeless body into a cooler, took a cab to Washington Heights and dumped the body on the side of the highway, they say.

Juarez is now set to face a full murder trial.
