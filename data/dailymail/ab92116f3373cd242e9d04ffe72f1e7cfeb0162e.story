Paul Ogata says he was racially mocked by a Qantas attendant on a flight from LA to Sydney

Japanese-American comedian Paul Ogata claims a Qantas flight attendant humiliated him about his race on a flight from LA to Australia where he is currently touring.

Ogata said the male steward acted shocked when the comedian ordered the beef from the menu and loudly replied with 'You don't want the Asian chicken? What a disgrace!'

Then to make matters worse, Ogata said laughter erupted from 'White Australian' passengers sitting near him on the 13-hour-flight.

The Hawaii born 45-year-old was so outraged by the remark that he took to his blog to vent his disbelief about the humiliating experience labelling the 'tale of the Q Qlux Qlan'

He posted that he calmly decided to sit in quiet rage despite being offended by the remark.

'I glared at him and he moved on. Could I have started an altercation then and there?' 

'Yes. But I don't like to sit in restraints in the lavatory under guard by an Air Marshall for thirteen hours. So instead, like Oran Juice Jones, I chilled,' he said.

'Ah, I see. So in addition to the fact that he's a racist a**, he operates under the greater paradigm of racism that is his employer, Qantas. The menu says 'Asian style spicy chicken,' but the other option is simply, 'Red wine braised beef.'

Ogata went on to question the general use of the word - Asian.

'But why isn't it 'White people style beef'? Plus, what kind of Asian do they mean? Russians? Israeli? Laotian?'

'If we are to understand Qantas correctly, the 4.4 billion people in 44 different Asian countries all cook chicken the same spicy non-white way. If it is based on a Chinese recipe, then why not just say so.'

But his rant didn't stop there as his incredulousness about the situation continued.

'Most likely, the mouth-breather in charge of 'customer service' on my flight will get a special commendation from corporate,' he said.

'After all, he went out of his way not to humiliate the white passengers for not ordering the 'white people style beef.' 

'For an airline that lost over $200 million in the first half of this year alone, you’d think they would try a little harder to please.'

Qantas stated that no complaint was made to the two senior cabin crew managers on board the flight at the time, so the company was unaware of the issue until it was raised with the airline on social media.

The airline company is going through the process of talking to the other flight attendants on board to understand their perspective on events, as well as what steps might be taken to ensure it does not happen again.

'Qantas does not tolerate discrimination in any form and we take such reports very seriously. We are investigating this issue further internally,' a Qantas spokesman said.

'As a hugely diverse, multicultural business with employees of around 100 different nationalities, suggestions of racism are extremely disturbing to us. We consider racism deplorable and unacceptable wherever it occurs.'
