Facebook has shut down the account of former TLC star Mama June's boyfriend, Mark McDaniel, after it was revealed that he is a convicted child molester.

McDaniel was active on the social media site until Tuesday when his page was taken down by Facebook staffers. 

The website has a strict policy in place that prohibits convicted sex offenders from using Facebook.

Kicked out: Facebook took down Mark McDaniel's page Tuesday because under the site's policy, convicted sex offenders are not allowed to be on Facebook 

Vile crime: McDaniel (left) was released from prison in March after serving 10 years for molesting Mama June's daughter Anna Cardwell (right) when she was only eight years old

Other Facebook users are being asked to contact the site administrations if they encounter an account 'that may belong to a convicted sex offender.'

'Once we’re able to verify someone’s status as a sex offender, we immediately disable their account and remove all the information associated with it from Facebook,' the policy states.

Before McDaniel was booted from the site, he shared a photo showing him cradling his baby granddaughter, TMZ first reported.

He also had posts on his wall from friends welcoming h‫im home from prison after his release earlier this year.

TLC axed the long-running reality show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo last month after it has been alleged that ‘Mama June’ Shannon has secretly rekindled her romance with her former boyfriend Mark McDaniel.

Shannon has repeatedly denied that she has been dating the man who was convicted of forcing her daughter Anna 'Chickadee' to perform oral sex on him on multiple occasions in 2002, sometimes with her younger sister, Pumpkin, in bed next to her.

But network executives decided to cancel the show after images emerged showing Shannon and McDaniel together.

In an exclusive interview with Dr Phil Monday, Mama June insisted that at least one of the photos showing the couple reunited following McDaniel’s release has been doctored.

'I would never take my child around someone like that,' she told Dr Phil.

Shannon previously claimed she has only seen him McDaniel twice since his release - once by coincidence and once to give her daughter, Pumpkin, some closure because she believed he was her father.

Speaking out: In an exclusive interview with Dr Phil, Shannon has again denied she is in a relationship with her daughter's molester, claiming he is now seeing someone else

The children's uncle has also claimed in an interview that he witnessed the young girl sharing a bed with McDaniel and Mama June during a trip to North Carolina in September.

'I'm disgusted with June for not protecting Alana from Mark,' Uncle Poodle - real name Lee Thompson - told the National Enquirer.

'This guy can't be trusted. He needs to be locked up and have the key thrown away.'

McDaniel's victim, Anna Cardwell, is now 20 years and is married with a young child of her own.
