A mother of two who vowed not to be ‘fat and 40’ has lost half her bodyweight - and finally feels confident enough to wear a dress for the first time in 20 years.

Lisa Kirkham, 42, tipped the scales at more than 18st at her heaviest, but after ditching a calorific diet of crisps, chocolate, and fizzy drinks in favour of green tea and fresh fruit and vegetables, she now weighs in at a svelte 9st 10lb.

Lisa hadn’t worn a dress since her wedding day in 1993 when she married husband Philip, 51, but she’s now become a shadow of her former self after dropping an incredible eight dress sizes.

Desperate Lisa joined Weight Watchers with her sister, and soon began to shed the pounds, dropping 8 dress sizes

Lisa, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, said: 'I had to do something because I didn’t want to be fat and 40 and I wanted to be well for my children as they grew up.

'My eating habits have changed completely, and it’s all about mind over matter.

'When I look back at pictures, I feel like a different person.

'I still don’t think of myself as skinny, but my seven-year-old niece doesn’t recognise the old me, and that makes me feel skinny.'

It took an appointment with a skin consultant for it to hit home with Lisa that she needed to do something about her weight.

She said: 'I was under investigation for a skin problem and I had to take my top off to show him my skin.

'That’s what sparked it, and I knew I had to do something. The hospital was sorting my skin out and my health was starting to suffer.

'I was wearing anything black or dark-coloured and elasticated, and there was no way you would catch me in anything where my legs were on show.

'I had weight problems from being a teenager but after I had my children the weight piled on over about a year or so and there was no incentive to lose it because I was stuck at home.'

Despite being a size 16 when she got married more than two decades ago, Lisa’s weight gradually increased until she was buying size 26 clothes.

She tried numerous shock diets and in a matter of months lost four stone, but it was a quick fix so within months she put the weight straight back on.

Desperate to tackle her excess bulge, 
Lisa joined Weight Watchers with her sister, and soon began to shed the 
pounds through the ProPoints plan

'I was losing on average about four pounds a week,' she said.

'I’d set myself little goals so I had something to aim for and I started doing things for charity as a way to start keeping fit.

'I
 stopped eating so much fatty food and started eating fresher meals and 
cutting down on my portion sizes, and my stomach shrunk.'

Her success quickly showed, and Lisa, an administrator, started receiving compliments on her slim new figure.

Petite
 5ft 3in Lisa said: 'Before I started losing weight, I didn’t want to 
draw attention to myself, but now my confidence is unbelievable.

'I
 was very shy because I was worried if I said something stupid or acted 
silly while out with my friends that people would just laugh at me 
because I was fat.

'But now I will approach people that I’ve never met before rather than just sticking to people I know.'

And Lisa began to notice the change in herself as she quickly moved through the dress sizes, now wearing a size 10.

Lisa started eating fresher meals and cutting down on my portion sizes, dropping half her body weight meaning her sons Michael, 17, and Jonathan, 13, can now pick her up

She said: 'I was always having to replace my wardrobe to keep up with the weight loss, and the amount of stuff I’ve given to charity is unbelievable because things just don’t look right when they’re baggy.

'I can buy clothes which are actually in style now, and my feet have gone from a size six to a size four-and-a-half as well.

'It feels really good, and all of my friends and family have been so supportive.

'My boys Michael, 17, and Jonathan, 13, have helped me and we go running together or to the gym.

'I’ve got more energy than them and my husband put together now!'

Where as Lisa would binge on sandwiches with mayonnaise and butter, chicken and chips and burgers before, she now prefers a diet of lean meat and vegetables with a low-calorie hot chocolate for a treat.

Lisa added: 'Don’t get me wrong, I do still eat a big bag of Maltesers on a Thursday after Weight Watchers but I can control my diet for the rest of the week, and you’re not supposed to deprive yourself.

'I eat soup, I drink lots of green tea and I do a lot of walking.

'I only have potatoes once a week and I find it very easy to say no now, plus I weigh everything and make sure my portion is smaller than  I give to Philip and the boys.

'I'm really pleased. I would never put the weight back on, and people say that if I can do it, anyone can do it. Just by small changes you can make a big difference.'

Lisa’s slimming club leader, Francine Sheridan, said: 'Lisa is an inspiration to anyone losing weight. I have got to know her and was so proud of her when she reached her goal.

'The support she has given to other members has been amazing, encouraging them to join her at swimming or walking outside of the meetings. She provides ideas, recipes, and motivation in the meeting and on our Facebook page and we are lucky to have her as part of our family.'
