Kelsea and Andy Hoskins were just like any excited young couple expecting their first baby when they received some shocking news that changed everything.

During a routine ultrasound at around the five month mark of Mrs Hoskins' pregnancy, a doctor informed the Quincy, Illinois pair that their unborn son was developing organs outside of his body, a birth defect  known as an Omphalocele.

The condition mean that Hayden, as they would soon name him, was growing part of his abdominal organs in a protective sack near his umbilical cord.

Perfect: Hayden Hoskins was born to parents Kelsea and Andy at Barnes Hospital in Missouri where he now has his sack of external organs wrapped for protection in bandages

As they listened to their doctor explain the complications and potentially fatal effect on his lung development, neither parent could believe their ears. 

'I heard the word Omphalocele and had no idea what that meant,' recalled Mr Hoskins. 

Happiness: Mr and Mrs Hoskins (pictured with Hayden) learned of the birth defect known as an Omphalocele, at her five month ultrasound when they also discovered the sex of the baby

Luckily for the nervous father-to-be, his wife was in good hands, being taken care of at the Fetal Care Center at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St Louis, Missouri where obstetricians have delivered many babies with similar complications successfully.

Mrs Hoskins' doctor, Dr Allison Cahill described the baby's prospects before his birth to Fox 2 St. Louis KTVI:  'It looks like, on ultrasound, that there are some loops of his bowel and intestine in there but also some portion of his liver.'

The concern with these types of defects, she explained to Fox, is that until delivery, there is no way to know if the baby's lungs have been able to grow to capacity.

Warmer: The baby was promptly slipped into a type of sealed plastic bag so as not to lose his body heat or any fluids

But remaining upbeat before her February C-section, smiling mother-to-be Mrs Hoskins told cameras: 'I am nervous but it'll be a good day.'

Heading to the delivery room ahead of schedule due to high blood pressure, she and her husband were surrounded by a team of doctors and nurses ready to ensure the baby's survival.

To everyone's relief, Hayden let out a few strong screams as he exited the womb showing no signs of the potential heart and kidney trouble that can have fatal results for a newborn Omphalocele at birth.

Moving on: Hayden is transferred to the NICO at Children's Hospital nearby for monitoring

Sweet: But not before a tender moment with his mother

'Really the test is when he's here how he does, so it's always very reassuring when babies come out and they cry,' Dr Cahill said. 'Once he got over here he needed a little bit more help with his breathing so he has a tube down his windpipe.'

Hayden was immediately slipped into a medical zip-lock bag to preserve body heat and fluid and after a tender moment between mother and child, he was rushed to the NICU at nearby Children's Hospital, where he will be monitored.

'We have every expectation that he'll be the little boy that we're soon to discover. Really no anticipated downside to him,' Dr Cahill reassured.

In about a year, Hayden will have the sack of organs tucked back into his body and his life will resume as normal.

'Amazing, absolutely amazing,' a proud Mr Hoskins gushed post-labour when asked how he felt. 'Just so relieved,' he added.
