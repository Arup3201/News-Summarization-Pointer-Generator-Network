He's one sixth of the UK's most famous family, so it's no surprise that Romeo Beckham holds some pretty substantial pulling power.

In fact it's been reported that thanks to his most recent Burberry advert, sales of the brand's classic £1,500 trench coats have gone up a substantial 10 per cent.

The fashion label has credited the 12-year-old son of David and Victoria Beckham for its rise in sales in the US, Europe and the Middle East after he starred in their Christmas advert last year.

In the three months to the end of December, better-than-expected sales of Burberry coats, bags and fashion climbed 14 per cent to £600m.

In the four-minute festive film, Romeo wears the trench, a monogrammed scarf and carries a Burberry umbrella to match his outfit. 

The advert, which was first released in November, was the first ever Christmas campaign for Burberry and starred Romeo  alongside 50 dancers all clad in the beige trench coats.

Such was his popularity in the film called From London With Love that it was watched nine million times after being released.

Simon Fuller - who previously managed the Spice Girls - is reported to have negotiated a £45,000 fee for Romeo; something which Burberry has declined to comment on in the past.

Burberry’s finance director Carol Fairweather previously said: ‘I don’t sign off every invoice that comes into the building.

'I don’t make those decisions. It’s not for me to comment on what arrangements were paid to Romeo,' when questioned about his fee.  

However it seems it the figure is accurate, it could have been money well spent. For this isn't the first time the Romeo effect has helped to boost sales for the fashion brand.

When he starred in its Spring/Summer 2013 campaign, Burberry reported a 13 per cent boost in what it called a 'stand out,' year for the brand.

The campaign was Romeo's first for the fashion house and came after over a year of discussion between Burberry Chief Designer Christopher Bailey and Victoria Beckham. 

Bailey has previously said that Romeo is an, 'utter joy,' to work with. And once revealed: 'He's the sweetest, loveliest little chap.

'He loves clothes and fashion, he has an aesthetic point of view. He know what he likes and he had a lot of fun.'
