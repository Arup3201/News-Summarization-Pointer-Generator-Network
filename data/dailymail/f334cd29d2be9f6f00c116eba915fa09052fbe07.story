Northampton secured maximum points from a 38-15 European Rugby Champions Cup demolition of Treviso in Italy.

Scores from Samu Manoa, Alex Waller, Ben Foden, Luther Burrell, George Pisi and a penalty try ensured it was a job well done by Jim Mallinder's side against their struggling Pool Five rivals.

Saints number eight Manoa opened the scoring after nine minutes when he finished off a patient build-up by forcing his way over from close range.

It was a fifth try of the season for the United States international, who is expected to join French champions Toulon in the summer.

Outside-half Stephen Myler added the conversion to give Saints a solid early lead.

A change of referee due to an injury to Peter Fitzgibbon delayed the game for several minutes and he was replaced by Leo Colgan.

Former Worcester and Wasps outside-half Joe Carlisle then got Treviso on the scoreboard with a penalty.

Treviso lost lock Francesco Minto to the sin-bin when he tackled Sam Dickinson in an offside position and Saints immediately grabbed a second try.

Myler kicked the penalty to touch and the Saints' eight were too strong for the Treviso pack, with prop Waller almost powering his way over.

The visitors secured the bonus point within nine minutes of the restart with two quick scores from Foden and Burrell.

The latter was the provider in the first try with a superb pass to set Foden free and he produced a smart finish, with Myler kicking the difficult conversion.

Almost immediately, Saints went over for their first try after excellent work by Tom Stephenson and Jamie Elliot allowed Burrell to finish.

Treviso did get back into the contest when fly-half Carlisle sent a long pass to wing Ludovico Nitoglia to go over in the corner.

Saints' fifth was a penalty try when Treviso popped up at the scrum and the home side went down to 14 men for the second time when replacement Romulo Acosta was shown a yellow card.

Treviso did, however, manage a second try when the impressive Carlisle intercepted Stephenson's pass and raced home from 60 metres.

But there was still time for Saints to get their sixth when replacement Pisi touched down with two minutes to go.
