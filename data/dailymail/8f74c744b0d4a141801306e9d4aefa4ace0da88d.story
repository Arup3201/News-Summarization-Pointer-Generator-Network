After a chaotic match on Sunday, Chelsea and Manchester United meet again just three days later in Wednesday's Capital One Cup clash at Stamford Bridge. The referee is Lee Mason.

Mark Clattenburg has referred to an 'extraordinary incident' in his match report from Sunday's explosive game at Stamford Bridge.

The FA are set to review video evidence after launching an investigation into claims referee Clattenburg racially abused Chelsea midfielder John Obi Mikel during Blues' 3-2 defeat by Manchester United.

The specific incident referred to by Clattenburg remains unclear but referees submit them on matters that may require FA intervention.

The police could also yet become 
involved after the lawyer behind the mooted black players' breakaway 
union, Peter Herbert, made a written complaint to the Metropolitan 
Police Service (MPS).

Chelsea made a complaint to the Premier League after Mikel stormed into the referee’s room to demand an apology after claiming Clattenburg made a racist slur when he booked the midfielder in the 76th minute.

One of Chelsea’s Spanish stars is also involved after players claim they heard Clattenburg refer to him as ‘a Spanish t**t’. Spaniards Fernando Torres, Juan Mata and Cesar Azpilicueta all played against United.

It has also emerged that Clattenburg has been stood down from this weekend's Premier League action.

The FA and Premier League could ask Sky TV for footage from the 20 camera angles used for the big live matches to help confirm whether Mark Clattenburg made an inappropriate or racially aggravated comment. Premier League refs wear microphones, which means evidence from Michael McDonough and Simon Long — who both ran the line — and fourth official Michael Jones may prove crucial.

A statement from the Professional Game Match Officials read: 'We believe that, with any football match, the focus should not be on the officials but on the players and the game itself.

'Mark Clattenburg is one of the elite referees in world football and, in these circumstances, the intense level of scrutiny would detract from the match and be unfair to the clubs and the supporters of both sides.'

The FA will now request all footage from Sky Sports from the game. While not all are recorded, they should help confirm whether Clattenburg made an inappropriate or racially aggravated comment.

An FA statement read: 'The FA has begun an investigation relating to allegations made following Sunday's fixture at Stamford Bridge between Chelsea and Manchester United. The FA will make no further comment at this time.'

Premier League referees also wear 
microphones, which suggests evidence by Michael McDonough and Simon Long
 — who ran the line — or fourth official Michael Jones could be crucial.

However, these discussions are not recorded — meaning it could come down to one man's word against another, like in the John Terry and Anton Ferdinand race row.

Herbert, in making his complaint to the MPS, wrote: 'The Society of Black Lawyers wishes to record the incident that took place at Chelsea FC as a racial incident according to ACPO [Association of Chief Police Officers] guidelines.

'Although this matter may be investigated by the FA it is appropriate that the MPS independently see if a racially-aggravated offence has occurred.'

It is understood the police had received the letter on Monday night but it was by no means certain an investigation would follow.

Chelsea, United and anti-racism group Kick It Out all refused to comment on the unfolding story on Monday morning.

However,
 the Blues did confirm they had decided against holding a press 
conference on Tuesday to preview Wednesday night's Capital One Cup clash
 with United. Lee Mason is the referee for that meeting.

Chelsea made the official complaint at 7.45pm on Sunday night, but Clattenburg had already been confronted by then.

Chief executive Ron Gourlay, with Mikel and manager Roberto Di Matteo, 
demanded an apology during stormy scenes in the referee’s room.

Clattenburg refused and Chelsea decided 
to take the incredible action of launching an immediate complaint to the
 Premier League, via match delegate Nick Cusack, over his language.

According to sources close to the players, they are willing to make statements to the FA’s disciplinary committee this week.

A club spokesman said: ‘We have 
lodged a complaint to the Premier League match delegate with regards to 
inappropriate language used by the referee and directed at two of our 
players in two separate incidents in today’s match. The match delegate 
will pass the complaint to the FA.’

Clattenburg
 was pictured leaving his home near Newcastle on Monday morning before 
getting into a car with fellow official Michael Oliver.

The incidents occurred on the day Chelsea threw support behind the Kick Racism Out of Football campaign.

Players from Chelsea and United — with the exception of United’s Ashley Young — wore One Game One Community T-shirts in the warm-up.

John Terry, serving a four-match ban for
 racially insulting Anton Ferdinand last October, wore a Kick It Out 
badge as he watched from the sidelines.

Rio Ferdinand, fined £45,000 for his ‘choc ice’ tweet, also ended his feud with Ashley Cole when they shook hands before the game.

But all that was forgotten amid dramatic scenes nearly two hours after the final whistle.

Home players heard the alleged 
comment to Mikel and will back up his story. Clattenburg said he would 
co-operate with any inquiry.

Professional
 Game Match Officials, the body which represents Premier League 
referees, released a statement which read: ‘PGMO is aware of the 
allegations and they are being treated with the utmost seriousness. Mark
 will co-operate fully and welcomes the opportunity for the facts to be 
established.’

Prospect, the referees' union, said 
in a statement: 'Prospect is committed to helping to eradicate racism in
 football and in society generally. In the context of that commitment, 
Prospect is offering full support to Mark Clattenburg in relation to the
 allegations made against him.

'It
 is now important that the allegations are fully investigated through 
the proper process as quickly as possible. We will be making no further 
comment at this stage.'

Meanwhile Gordon Taylor has urged the Football Association to deal with Chelsea's accusations against as quickly and fairly as possible.

Taylor, head of the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), is wary of the fact that the most recent row concerning racism in football - that involving Blues captain Terry - dragged on for almost a year before he was banned by the FA, and he does not want this case to go on for such a long period of time.

'We've got to learn the lessons of the last 12 months,' Taylor said.

'This is extremely serious for the referee involved so that's why it's important that it is dealt with in the most thorough manner and as quickly, efficiently, and transparently as possible.'

Taylor thinks conversations between officials should be recorded to help any cases that come up in the future.

'The PFA have never been against that (recording what is said),' he said.

'That could be an aid for clarity over what exactly has happened in those situations.'
