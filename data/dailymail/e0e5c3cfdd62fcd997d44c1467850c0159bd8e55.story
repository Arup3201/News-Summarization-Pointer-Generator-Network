A cruel pet owner who kept two marmosets in appalling conditions at his squalid home has been banned from keeping monkeys for life.

Disabled Peter Powell, 53, from Plymouth, Devon, forced six-month-old Tya and two-year-old Rattler to perch on a curtain pole or crawl into a dirty tube slung underneath.

The animals were kept in 'heartbreaking' conditions in a room littered with, cigarette butts, faeces, and a razor blade, and forced to travel in Powell's pocket when he drove around town.

'Heartbreaking': Rattler the marmoset clings to a curtain rail at Powell's Plymouth home. The two-year-old primate was kept a litter strewn room with six-month-old Tya without specialist food or suitable perching room

Scruffy: Underweight and in a bad state of health Rattler hangs on to the wooden curtain pole in the living room

On Friday Plymouth Magistrates' Court slapped Powell with a lifelong ban on keeping monkeys after he pleaded guilty to neglect at an earlier hearing.

He was given a two year conditional discharge and ordered to pay £2,000 in costs.

RSPCA inspector Becky Wadey visited Powell’s home last year with 
primate experts from Monkey World-Ape Rescue Centre, in Dorset, and found 
the monkeys living in appalling conditions.

A razor blade, 
cigarette butts and faeces were scattered across the floor and there was
no specialised food or suitable perching room needed for their care.

She
said: 'It was heartbreaking to see these poor little marmosets like this – their fur was sticky with faeces and urine and they were clearly underweight and in a bad state of health.

'Tya, the little one, was just crouched inside a dirty tube set up beneath the curtain rail while Rattler was balanced precariously on top of it.

'There was so little room for both of them that at one point Rattler knocked Tya off the perch – she had quite a fall to the hard floor.

'It is hard to understand how anyone could think this was an acceptable way to keep an animal.'

Tya: After Tya was rescued by the RSPCA she was found to be suffering from the early stages of rickets

This was the RSPCA’s third major case involving cruelty 
or neglect to a marmoset since January in what is a growing trade in 
keeping them as pets.

Dr Lisa Riley, primatologist for the RSPCA, 
said: 'These cases show exactly why we are calling for a ban on primates
such as pets. Marmosets are seen as small and easy to keep but this is 
far from the truth - they are very hard to look after and totally 
unsuitable as pets.

'We must stop this growing trade. Breeders and
dealers charge large sums of money and it has become far too easy to 
pick up a marmoset over the internet, especially since you don’t need a 
licence to have one.'

Tya and Rattler were removed and taken to Monkey World where it was found they were suffering from the early stages of rickets, or metabolic bone disease.

After being given specialist care and lessons in how to feed, talk and socialise from fellow marmoset Gabi, they are now growing and doing well.

'Monkey man' Powell, 53, pleaded guilty to neglect

Speaking after the hearing Powell said he was 'upset' about what had happened and that the RSPCA had been too quick to judge the conditions in his flat.

The unemployed father-of-three, who still keeps a pair of zebra finches, said: 'They came on a particular morning when I wasn’t expecting them.

'I was dealing with some issues that morning and hadn’t got round to doing the housework.

'Normally it wouldn’t have been that dirty.'

Powell, who was disabled by a stroke, said the two marmosets had been able to play on ropes he had attached to the ceiling of his lounge.

He had covered these with plastic ivy leaves to make the room look like a jungle.

It was one of these that the court heard one of the monkeys had eaten.

He said: 'I was well known in Plymouth where they used to call me the monkey man as I rode around in my mobility scooter with a marmoset in my pocket.'

He said the RSPCA had previously been involved with him in June 2010 when he lost a 10-year-old marmoset called Bonnie in Plymouth city centre.

He had tripped allowing Bonnie, who lived in a dolls house, to run away.

Marmosets originate from Brazil and usually live in the upper canopy of trees in forests.

Monkey World are campaigning to change laws that govern the keeping of primates as pets in Britain.

Dr Alison Cronin MBE, director of Monkey World, said: 'We are an international primate rescue and rehabilitation centre, but more and more we find ourselves being called to rescue and rehabilitate monkeys being kept as pets legally in Britain today.'
