An armoured truck security guard is on the run after allegedly shooting his partner in the head and vanishing with more than $2million in cash.

After escaping from the crime scene, Kenneth Konias Jr phoned a friend to say: 'I f***ed up. My life is over.'

The suspect, 22, is accused of killing Michael Haines, 31, in the back of the truck after the men,  both Garda Cash Logistics guards, had made several stops to collect money.

Haines was discovered dead in the truck when it was found 
idling under a bridge in Pittsburgh on Tuesday afternoon.

'This is a premeditated murder,' 
Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen Zappala told Wpxi.com.

'Our belief is 
that he planned to rob the company and if he had to kill the guard then 
he planned to do that. He shot the guy from close range in the back of 
the head to accomplish the robbery. Thatâ€™s pretty cold.'

The truck had picked 
up money from the Rivers Casino shortly before 9am that day and was found 
about 3.40pm, after the guards had made several stops elsewhere, police 
said.

Pittsburgh police major crimes Cmdr. Thomas Stangrecki told The Associated 
Press that surveillance video from the area shows the truck had been parked 
under the bridge since shortly before 1.30pm that day.

Garda officials have offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Konias

'There's a time lapse from when the truck was parked' until it was found, 
Stangrecki said. 'He must have gone to the company parking lot where his car, 
his Ford Explorer, was parked, and got there and left the area.'

Homicide detectives went to the address where Konias lived with his parents in Dravosburg and found his bloody uniform jacket in his bedroom.

Stangrecki said Konias' family is cooperating with the investigation and had not been aware of the robbery.

'We know that he returned to his family's home, left the jacket and left the 
house,' Stangrecki said. 'He may have come home normally from work like he 
always does. And he hasn't been seen since.'

So far, police don't believe Konias had any help.

'At this point, no, it looks like he's the brains behind this incident,' Stangrecki said.

The police report shows that Konias called a friend after the alleged shooting, reports Wpxi.com.

He said, 'I f***ked up. My life is over.'

His friend replied: 'Are you having a bad day at work? Did you get a girl pregnant.'

Konias said, 'Worse than that,' and his friend asked: 'Did you kill someone?'

The suspect then confessed that he had, and claimed he had enough money to last the rest of his life.

The FBI was also investigating, and is still auditing the exact amount of 
money taken from the truck.

Garda officials have offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to his arrest and released a statement 
saying company officials are 'shocked and deeply saddened at the death of our 
colleague and extend our condolences to his family.

'We are continuing to assist 
law enforcement it its investigation of this incident.'

Stangrecki said investigators notified Pittsburgh International Airport and 
officials at various transportation agencies as well as U.S. border authorities 
to be alert for Konias in the nationwide manhunt.

Authorities believe Konias may have two guns - his 
service pistol and another hand gun, and Zappala told reporters, 'We are trying 
to stress how dangerous this individual is.'

'We want everybody looking for him.'

Police said he is driving a tan Ford Explorer with Pennsylvania license plate number GZW-4572.
