A Pennsylvania woman brought home more than she bargained for when a black widow spider hitched a ride in a bunch of grapes.

Yvonne Whalen, of Monaghan, made the horrifying find this week while washing the fruit before eating it. The scary spider was one of two hiding in the bunch, the other died after spending a week in her refrigerator.

The woman’s discovery is only the latest in a series of disturbing finds in fruit across multiple states.

Deadly: Black widow spiders have enough venom to kill children and the elderly if bitten

‘I saw the spider come up [over the grapes],’ she told ABC27. ‘I quickly dropped the colander and screamed.’

Ms Whalen explained her initial instinct was to flush it down the sink, but she instead she trapped it in a plastic container and looked for a similar spider online.

It didn’t take long for her to discover she had a brush with a juvenile black widow spider.

‘Had I known this could happen, I would have paid much more attention,’ she added.

Ryan ‘The Bugman’ Bridge, a local insect expert, confirmed the woman’s suspicions to the station.

‘They are dangerous,’ he said, ‘they are venomous.’

Ms Whalen notified Giant, the supermarket where she bought the grapes, and explained she only wanted to make sure this did not happen to anyone else.

‘I gave them a call to let them know that I found the spider, I wasn't expecting anything in return,’ she said.

The chain sent her a gift card and pledged to be more diligent inspecting fruit, according to the station.

Spiders have also been discovered in grapes in Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri and Wisconsin, according to Food Safety News.

It is not uncommon for the deadly creatures to be found in grapes, according to Fox News.

Black widows are immediately noticeable because of the red mark on the back of their otherwise all-black bodies.

They carry enough venom to cause problems for humans, and can even be fatal in some cases.
