One of the masterminds of the Pakistan school massacre in which 132 children were slaughtered has been killed in a raid carried out by government security forces, officials claim.

A top government official in the Khyber tribal region said security forces conducted a raid in the Bara area late Thursday night which left leading Taliban commander Saddam Jan dead.

The troops were involved in a gunfight with Jan and a group of those living with him, said Shahab Ali Shah, the head of police administration in Khyber, near the Afghan border.

He said Saddam - a commander in the Pakistani Taliban - was killed in the hour-long shootout, while his six accomplices were injured and arrested.

While the Peshawar attack was ordered by Umar Mansoor on behalf of Maulana Fazlullah, the leader of Pakistan's Tehrik-e-Taliban, the planning was carried out by Jan.

Abu Shah added that Jan had previously been identified as being behind attacks on health workers giving polio vaccinations in the Peshawar valley, and another attack on paramilitary scouts. 

His death is the latest retaliatory strike carried out by the Pakistani government following the slaughter of  132 children at a Peshawar school on December 16.

In the wake of the attacks Pakistan repealed its ban on the death penalty and has since executed six militants, while military courts have been set up to fast-track terror trials. 

The brutal massacre, in which seven members of the Pakistani Taliban systematically slaughtered 150 people, was internationally condemned.

In other strikes, a suspected U.S. drone fired missiles at two compounds in Pakistan's North Waziristan today, killing at least seven alleged militants.

Intelligence officials said the early morning strikes hit the compounds of the Punjabi Taliban and a group of Uzbek militants in the Shawal area of North Waziristan, killing four and three militants respectively.

They said the Punjabi Taliban compound was being used as a training facility by the group's commander, Qari Imran, but it was unclear whether Imran himself was present at the time of attack.

And in the second strike, the drone-launched missile struck the compound of a group of Uzbek militants in the village of Mangrotai, killing three.

The officials all spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. 

Drone strikes are largely unpopular in Pakistan where many consider them a violation of the country's sovereignty and resent the collateral damage caused to Pakistani civilians.

But the U.S. insists these attacks are effective to eliminate militants in areas inaccessible to the Pakistani military.

Meanwhile, the government has reinstated the death penalty and formed military courts for terrorist-related cases as part of an ambitious anti-terrorism plan.

After almost 11 hours of deliberations with leaders of political parties, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said strong action was needed to root out extremism and warned no mercy would be shown to those behind attacks.

He announced the establishment of military courts as part of the 17-point plan of action - a week after a six year moratorium on the death penalty was lifted for terror cases in the wake of the school attack - which is the deadliest assault by militants in Pakistani history.
