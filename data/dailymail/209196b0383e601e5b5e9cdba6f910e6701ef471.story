These extraordinary images from ISIS-held territory show militants piling cigarettes and alcohol onto a bonfire in a crackdown on banned goods.

Jihadists have banned drinking and smoking in occupied territories in Iraq and Syria because it is against the harsh form of Sharia law they impose.

The pictures show men piling up dozens of bottles of whisky, cans of beer and hundreds of cartons of cigarettes before setting fire to the lot while waving the black flag of ISIS and wielding assault rifles.

Extraordinary pictures show ISIS militants piling hundreds of cartons of cigarettes, as well as a haul of alcohol, onto a bonfire and setting it alight

Banned: Dozens of confiscated bottles of whisky, vodka and other spirits, as well as cans of beer, were thrown onto the flames

Up in smoke: ISIS has banned smoking and drinking because it is against the harsh form of Sharia law it imposes in occupied territory in Syria and Iraq

Jihadists waved the black flag of ISIS as they made a pyre with the cigarettes and alcohol, prohibited in parts of Syria and Iraq they control

As part of the terror group's 'repent or die' rules imposed on towns and cities it overruns, smoking and drinking are strictly banned.

Militants were seen smashing bottles of expensive spirits before using the flammable liquids as fuel for the large fire, believed to be near Tikrit, Iraq.

Citizens of Mosul, in northern Iraq, were told after ISIS took over the stronghold: 'No drugs, no alcohol and no cigarettes allowed.'

Earlier this year in Raqqa, Syria, gunmen seized a vast haul of tobacco just days after they arrived in the city, taking all the cigarettes they could find in shops and setting them alight on a giant pyre.

A statement from the jihadists said: 'Every smoker should be aware that with every cigarette he smokes in a state of trance and vanity he is disobeying god.'

A French ISIS member who moved to Syria in 2012 was jailed in November after returning to France because he could not face the terror group's smoking ban. 

Flames: The sight echoed scenes earlier this year in Raqqa, Syria, earlier this year, where the terror group seized alcohol from shops and bars before setting fire to it just days after their takeover of the city

Jihadists have previously told citizens in Raqqa: 'Every smoker should be aware that with every cigarette he smokes in a state of trance and vanity he is disobeying god'

The ban on booze in ISIS-controlled areas has put up the price of alcohol across Iraq as delivery trucks take long detours to avoid crossing paths with the terror group

Hundreds of cartons of cigarettes were set on fire. One French jihadists was jailed in Paris in November after returning to France because he could not deal with the militants' ban on smoking

Flavien Moreau, 27, was the first French citizen to be tried for joining ISIS and was sentenced to seven years jail by a court in Paris.

Moreau tried chewing nicotine gum but  returned to France after just two weeks in Syria because of he could not deal with the strict ban on cigarettes. 

According to The Week, Moreau told the court: 'I really struggled with not smoking. It was forbidden by the katiba [group of Islamist militants]. I had brought Nicorette gum with me, but it wasn't enough. I left my gun with my emir and I left.' 

However, in September, ISIS made a U-turn on their draconian ban on smoking in Kirkuk province Iraq, allowing people to buy cigarettes to boost their popularity.

The ban on booze is said to have had a detrimental effect on the Iraqi economy, as alcohol deliveries to shops and bars in areas not held by ISIS are forced to take massive detours to avoid running into the jihadists.

According to RT, cans of Heineken now cost $5, up from $1, and bottles of whisky have more than trebled in price since ISIS entered the country.

Shi'ite militia were also reported to be demanding $15,000 bribes to ensure the safety of delivery trucks, further adding to the cost of transporting alcohol to more liberal cities, such as the capital Baghdad.
