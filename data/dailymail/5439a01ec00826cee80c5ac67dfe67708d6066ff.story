The British bank accused of hiding £160billion of transfers that helped finance terror groups and Iran's nuclear programme saw its share price plummet by 16 per cent yesterday - wiping £6billion from the stock's value.

Standard Chartered, which is accused of conspiring with Tehran for almost ten years, had already taken a hammering in Hong Kong, where the shares ended 14.9 per cent down. At one point, its shares were down by a quarter before rallying.

Prices had already dropped six per cent yesterday after the accusations were made 
just before the close of the London market, but had bounced back 8 per cent to 1327p by lunchtime today.

The UK bank has also hit back verbally by insisting 99.9
 per cent of the alleged transactions complied with regulations and that
 any breaches were 'small clerical errors'.

Chairman Sir John Peace cut short his Florida holiday last night to fly to New York for talks with the bank's lawyers before a hearing with U.S. regulators on August 15.

Speaking to the Financial Times, he said: 'If Standard Chartered was permanently hurt by these accusations that would be very wrong. We intend to contest (them).'

It is understood that the bank's top executives are lobbying the UK government in a bid to win support against the claims.

City of London bankers are also forming ranks behind the bank in an effort to defend what they see as an attack by U.S. authorities on the British sector.

'If we don't stand up to it, it could be catastrophic for London's financial standing,' one senior City figure told the FT.

'There has to be some stage where Number 10 or the Treasury says something in defence of the banks.'

Peter Sands, Standard Chartered Chief Executive, said 'culture and values are our first and last lines of defence'

Regulators in New York have accused the bank of being a 
‘rogue institution’ that broke sanctions imposed on Iran and put profits
 ahead of global security and the law.

It
 worked with three Iranian banks suspected of being used by Tehran to 
finance its weapons programmes, according to an explosive report.

US
 authorities suspect the Iranian banks also funded terrorist and 
militant groups, including Hezbollah, Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic 
Jihad.

The New York State 
Department of Financial Services accused Standard Chartered of doing 
business with Burma, Libya and Sudan, which are also under sanctions.

It said the London-based bank, which has 87,000 global staff with 2,000
 of them in London, had shown ‘obvious contempt’ for US financial 
regulations.

The case echoes that of 
HSBC, which faces up to £600million in fines for laundering billions of 
pounds for Mexican drug lords and rogue states.

The world of banking has already been 
rocked by the ‘Libor’ rate rigging scandal that landed Barclays with a 
£290million fine last month.

At
 least 15 financial institutions, including Royal Bank of Scotland and 
Lloyds, are being investigated over concerns that rogue traders 
manipulated crucial interest rates which are used to set mortgages and 
are linked to trillions of pounds of investments.

In
 a devastating conclusion to its report, the New York watchdog wrote 
that Standard Chartered was ‘motivated by greed’ and had acted ‘without 
any regard for legal, reputational, and national security consequences’.

‘SCB designed and implemented an elaborate scheme by which to use its New York branch as a front for prohibited dealings with Iran – dealings that indisputably helped sustain a global threat to peace and stability,’ the New York regulators alleged.

The bank has been accused of operating as a 'rogue institution' by the New York State Department of Financial Services which spend nine months investigating their trade

The watchdog, which reviewed more than
 30,000 pages of documents during its nine-month investigation, said 
Standard Chartered covered its tracks by removing information from wire 
transfer messages used by US authorities to identify sanctioned 
countries – a process known as ‘wire stripping’.

The
 regulator said in ‘its evident zeal to make hundreds of millions of 
dollars at almost any cost’ the bank falsified business records, failed 
to keep accurate books, obstructed authorities and committed ‘wilful and
 egregious violations of law’.

Sixty thousand financial transactions were cited as suspicious.

It
 even cited a response from a senior London-based Standard Chartered 
executive to a New York official saying: ‘You f***ing Americans. Who are
 you to tell us, the rest of the world, that we’re not going to deal 
with Iranians?’

The Americans have threatened to 
revoke the licence of Standard Chartered in the US, which makes most of 
its money in Asia and sponsors Liverpool Football Club.

For
 nearly a decade until 2010 the lender ‘engaged in deceptive and 
fraudulent misconduct’ to move money through its New York branch on 
behalf of Iranian clients.

US sanctions against Tehran date back to 1979 but were heightened following the start of the Iran-Iraq war in 1980.

In
 2002, the country was described by former US president George W Bush as
 part of his ‘axis of evil’. Standard Chartered was one of the few banks
 to emerge from the financial crisis intact.

When
 announcing record profits of £2.3billion last week, its British chief 
executive Peter Sands – touted as a potential successor to Bank of 
England governor Sir Mervyn King – said its ‘culture and values are our 
first and last line of defence’.

Shadow Treasury minister Chris Leslie said the allegations – if true – would be a serious blow to the bank’s reputation.

‘Coming so soon after similar failings
 at HSBC, questions need to be asked about whether UK regulators are 
ensuring that the compliance regimes and anti-corruption standards 
pursued by our financial services sector when operating abroad are 
sufficiently up to the mark,’ he added.

‘It
 is highly likely that the banking inquiry currently under way in 
Parliament will want to consider lessons to be learned from potential 
failings such as this.’

Last
 night the banking group said in a statement that it had shut down its 
Iran operation in 2007 and had no ‘physical presence’ there. ‘As 
reported previously, the group is conducting a review of its historical 
US sanctions compliance and is discussing that review with US 
enforcement agencies and regulators,’ it said.

‘The group cannot predict when this review and these discussions will be completed or what the outcome will be.’

Standard
 Chartered was aided in its deception by its consultant Deloitte, one of
 the City’s Big Four accountants, the US watchdog claimed.

It said the accountancy firm ‘intentionally omitted critical information’ in its report to regulators.

This
 morning, David Green, former head of international policy for the 
Financial Services Authority, said the bank was not 'evil' but was no 
angel either.

'My gut 
reaction is they fall in the middle here. No bank of the international 
standing of Standard Chartered would want to get into trouble,' he said.

'They
 seem to have carried out a lot of due diligence on thousands of 
transactions. Would they knowingly help fund nuclear weapons?'
