It was only fitting that a former Hearts man should help to finally send the Championship title to Tynecastle. After all, this entire season deserves to be coloured maroon.

Yet it was not only a favour to his first love that Lee Wallace performed at Easter Road. In scoring the crucial, confidence-building opening goal for Rangers, he also delivered an immensely valuable prize to his current employers.

For the Ibrox side, games against Hibernian this term have been akin to a sadistically extended form of torture. Three successive defeats had delivered a crushing 9-1 aggregate. One more on Sunday and it was an historic clean sweep. It would also have delayed Hearts’ inevitable coronation for at least another six days.

Wallace, though, had different ideas. Freed to attack almost at will in a new 3-5-2 formation set up by Stuart McCall, he delivered a barnstorming display on the left flank. After speaking so openly on Friday about how this had been a season of professional and personal torment, here was an emphatic reminder of just how forceful a player he can be.

Others in blue followed his lead. Kenny Miller scored a highly controversial clincher ten minutes from the end — when refereeing headline-magnet Willie Collum ignored Hibs’ claims for a foul by Wallace — but, in truth, this was a victory that had foundations laid long before kick-off.

So often in recent times, Rangers fans have lamented the perceived lack of tactical thinking from those resident in the technical area. McCall, though, turned up in Leith and did a number on Hibs to secure the first triumph of his three-match reign. It did not go unnoticed.

‘Stuart McCall’s blue-and-white army’ was the chant from the visiting support as the minutes ticked down.

McCall’s hopes of remaining in situ beyond the end of the season may well hinge on winning promotion. If that is to become a reality, then he will need many more days like this one.

Overall, this was just a second win in 10 games for Rangers but it lifted them to within three points of their hosts, with a game in hand. They now have renewed hope of finishing second and reducing their play-off schedule in the fight to follow Hearts up.

Hibs’ 15-match unbeaten run is at an end but Stubbs is adamant this will not derail the momentum they have steadily built since the turn of the year.

Building momentum is now McCall’s (pictured) aim — after he recognised something different had to be attempted against Hibs if Rangers were not to face the inevitably of yet another defeat.

His ploy was to move to three centre-backs, with Marius Zaliukas and Bilel Mohsni flanking captain Lee McCulloch. It was hardly a trio to inspire confidence in the visiting support, given their ropey individual performances this term, yet the hope was that weight of numbers would help stifle the hosts in central areas and allow Darren McGregor and Wallace to advance as wing-backs.

It worked, and contributed to a fractured opening period in which clear sights of goal were at a premium.

The Easter Road side had the first, thanks to a majestic, deep cross hit with pace and accuracy from the left flank by Dylan McGeouch. Liam Fontaine had remained upfield from an earlier free-kick but couldn’t cash in on that gamble as he powered a header wide of target.

That was, though, as good as it got for Hibs in the first half as they encountered a Rangers line-up displaying a renewed level of organisation. That such a trait was noticeable says much about what went before.

It wasn’t bringing about a huge amount in the way of free-flowing entertainment but this at least now looked more like a toe-to-toe contest between well-matched opponents.

Nicky Law set up Dean Shiels — back on his old stomping ground — to slice one over the top from the fringe of the penalty area.

Then David Gray was caught out as Rangers broke forward and was forced to haul down Wallace around 25 yards out. Collum punished him with a yellow card before Law stepped up to whip the resultant free-kick a couple of feet too high.

A couple of set-piece exchanges then caused flickers of threat at either end. It would, though, be the visitors who took the lead two minutes ahead of the interval via a goal made possible by McCall’s rejig.

The move started at the feet of the oft-mocked Mohsni, who had the presence of mind to spot that Gray was out of position. A long, raking pass found Nicky Clark scampering into the space he had left behind.

Clark stepped on the brakes to switch to his right foot and sling a cross along the six-yard line. Kenny Miller couldn’t connect with a little attempted back-flick before McGregor was denied by a terrific blocking challenge from Lewis Stevenson. The ball broke loose and Wallace, who had stormed into the area to support his fellow wing-back, managed to scoop a shot high into the net despite desperate attempts to close him down.

It was the first time Rangers had taken the lead against Hibs on Championship duty and only the second goal they had managed during 313 minutes of this fixture. The question was whether they could hold onto the advantage they had finally gained.

Stubbs sought to fix one fault in his set-up when he replaced the injured Gray, who had endured a pretty difficult first half, with Keith Watson.

Yet the pattern of play remained similar after the restart. It was tense, often scrappy, and with the Ibrox side winning marginally more of the numerous little battles.

The game found fresh impetus after the hour-mark, however, as each side let slip a prime opportunity.

It was Rangers up first, with Mohnsi feeding Miller, whose angled ball set up Clark. He couldn’t sort out his feet quick enough, allowing paul Hanlon to block the strike.

Seconds later, Franck Dja Djedje found himself clear in the inside-right channel after the visiting defence was caught out. The angled shot was on, but Dja Djedje tried to square for sidekick Dominique Malonga and Zaliukas intercepted.

At last, there was a stretched, open look to the game. Clark was denied space to finish at the near post after another surging run from Wallace. Hibs looked to press back but saw their hopes extinguished in rancorous fashion.

Wallace looked to play a one-two with Miller, but it seemed Hanlon had beaten him to the return pass before they collided. The centre-back crashed to the deck claiming a foul, before Easter Road erupted in astonished fury as Collum waved play on. The rest of the home defence seemed to freeze, expecting the free-kick, but Miller was unperturbed as he gathered possession before cracking a shot past Mark Oxley.
