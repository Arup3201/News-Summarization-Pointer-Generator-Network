Murders, backstreet abortions, suicides, and bomb blasts —Molly Lefebure, aged 20, certainly had one of the most gruesome jobs in the world. The details of her story are so strange that apparently we can't be expected to believe them all.

Murder On The Home Front presented a frustratingly toned-down rewrite of a true story — how a young crime reporter ditched journalism to work alongside the pioneer of modern detective methods during the Blitz.

And it turned the extraordinary history of the birth of forensics into a more conventional murder mystery.

Murder On The Home Front is a new ITV1 crime drama set during the London Blitz of 1940. Pictured is Tamzin Merchant as Molly Cooper and Patrick Kennedy as Dr Lennox Collins

The real Molly Lefebure, who died in 
February aged 93, spent the war working for Home Office pathologist 
Professor Keith Simpson, a man so eccentric that he liked to prop up a 
skeleton on a chair at the table when he had his afternoon tea.

But he was a forensics genius, the 
first man to identify murder victims by strands of their clothing or 
their hair, and a showman, too: at one murder trial he produced the 
victim's skull, the first time such evidence had been exhibited in 
court. Everyone reacted with horror — except the man on trial, the 
victim's husband. He was hanged.

That flair and drama were missing from
the TV adaptation. The characters were interesting — they couldn't fail
to be, given the originals. But fiction fell far short of the truth.

The pathologist, played by Patrick Kennedy, spent a lot of time scolding gormless policemen for trampling on the evidence.

While they took notes, a constable 
clattered about in the background. Simpson was aghast to discover the PC
had cleaned up the entire murder scene: washed the dishes, scrubbed 
blood off the furniture and destroyed all the evidence.

'Tidied things up a bit, haven't I?' the copper said proudly.

Murder On The Home Front: The characters were interesting - they couldn't fail to be, given the originals. But fiction fell far short of the truth

Star Trek: The True Story reveals in the original pilot, creator Gene Roddenberry envisaged Mr Spock with a long tail with a point at the end

The show did capture the dark humour 
of the Blitz. Police photographer Issy, played by Emerald Fennell, was 
deliciously sardonic: 'My mother will never be able to eat red meat 
again,' she complained, as she described the aftermath of a German air 
raid that left 'body parts scattered all over our azaleas'.

Tamzin Merchant, best known for The 
Tudors (she was wife number five), had a combination of innocence and 
fire as Molly, the kind of girl who would blanche when told that a box 
contained a murder victim's tongue — and then look inside anyway.

But the story didn't convey how 
unconventional Molly Lefebure really was. 'You could spend 100 years in 
London's mortuaries,' she once remarked, 'and never be bored.'

The writers have failed utterly to 
capture that sense of ghoulish fascination. The most successful 
franchise in TV history was nearly a failure too, as Star Trek: The True
Story revealed.

In the original pilot, creator Gene Roddenberry 
envisaged Mr Spock as the Devil — instead of pointed ears, he had a long
tail with a point at the end.

The Starship Enterprise was boringly 
called the SS Yorktown, the commander was Captain April (played by 
Jeffrey Hunter) and the second-in-command was a female officer called 
simply 'Number One'.

Indeed it seems that Roddenberry, a 
former LA cop writing TV scripts in his spare time, saw all women as 
little more than numbers. When the show became a success, he boasted he 
had slept with every actress in every episode except two.

But it was 
sheer luck that made the show a hit. Hunter pulled out and the 
irrepressible William Shatner replaced him as Captain Kirk.

The 
storylines caught the idealistic mood of the Sixties, and were acclaimed
for showing the first 'inter-racial kiss' between Kirk and Lieutenant 
Uhuru, played by black actress Nichelle Nichols.

Even so, Star Trek didn't become a 
global success until years after the original series had been cancelled.
Fans were enthralled by the science in sci-fi, from teleport beams to 
anti-matter warp drives.

Leonard Nimoy, the original Spock, 
offered the best comment: 'I don't like the idea of teleporting. You 
might scramble some atoms. I wouldn't want to be the first to try it.'

Sometimes, it seems, fiction is actually stranger than truth.
