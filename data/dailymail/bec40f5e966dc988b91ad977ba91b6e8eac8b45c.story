British Muslim clerics are willing to carry out sharia marriages involving child brides as young as 12, an investigation has found.

Two imams said they would be prepared to officiate at the wedding of an underage girl to a man in his twenties, despite fears the pair would later have sex.

The revelations have led the Home Office to confirm that such ceremonies will be examined in the Government’s forthcoming Bill to outlaw forced marriages.

Child bride: An Imam at the Husaini Islamic Centre in Peterborough agreed to the marriage of a 12-year-old girl - but only if she consented to the nuptials

More than 1,000 of the 8,000 forced 
marriages of Britons each year are believed to involve girls of 15 or 
under, with one case last year allegedly involving a girl of five.

The clerics were approached by man 
posing as the father of a 12-year-old  who wanted her to marry to 
prevent her being tempted into a decadent Western lifestyle.

Imam 
Mohammed Kassamali, of the Husaini Islamic Centre in Peterborough, 
stressed the need for secrecy with such a ceremony.

He allegedly said: ‘If it (the 
marriage) was not possible, I would  have told you straight away... I 
would love the girl to go to her husband’s houses (sic) as soon as 
possible, the younger the better.

‘Under sharia (Islamic law) there is 
no problem. It is said she should see her first sign of puberty at the 
house of her husband.

‘The problem is that we cannot explain such things (the marriage) if the girl went tomorrow (to the authorities).

‘The other thing is the underage 
thing and if tomorrow the girl is,  let’s say coerced or forced into  
this, and she goes and reports it to the police then she will put all of
 us into the problems.’

Campaigners argue that children can't decide whether they want to be married (posed by model)

He also urged the father to encourage the newlyweds to ‘delay the togetherness’, meaning postpone  having sex.

Abdul Haque, a retired imam who still
 officiates at weddings at Shoreditch mosque, East London, reportedly 
agreed to carry out the ceremony after evening prayers on Wednesday.

‘Tell people it is an engagement but it will be a marriage,’ he told an undercover Sunday Times reporter.

‘In Islam, once the girl reaches 
puberty the father has the right, the parents have the right, but under 
the laws of this country if the girl complains and says her marriage has
 been arranged and she wasn’t of marriageable age, then the person who 
performed the marriage will be jailed as well as the mother and father.’

He explained how the Prophet Muhammad
 had married a seven-year-old girl before adding: ‘We are his followers,
 and that is what you have to explain (to your daughter).’

It is not illegal for clerics to perform Islamic marriages, even when one or both of those marrying are under 16.

Such marriages are not recognised in British law, so civil formalities can take place only if both are over 16.

Islamic law allows a couple to have 
sex after marriage but, as the legal age of consent is 16, a husband can
 be prosecuted for rape if he has sex with an underage girl.

Secret: Another retired Imam - who worships at the Shoreditch Mosque in east London - was happy to marry a 12-year-old girl but only if her parents told no-one about it

The Forced Marriage Unit, set up in 2005, dealt with 1,468 cases last year with 205 involving children under  the age of 15.

Farooq Murad, of the Muslim Council 
of Britain, said: ‘We are strongly opposed to it on the basis that it is
 illegal under the law of the land where we are living and even under 
sharia it is highly debatable.’

After being confronted, Kassamali 
said he would not have performed the marriage without the girl’s consent
 and would have sought legal advice. Haque declined to comment.

The Home Office said: ‘Child marriage
 is totally unacceptable and illegal. Perceived cultural sensitivities 
and political correctness cannot and will not get in the way of 
preventing and uncovering such abuse.’
