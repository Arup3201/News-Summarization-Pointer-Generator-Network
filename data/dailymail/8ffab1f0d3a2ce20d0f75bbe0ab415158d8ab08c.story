A sister who betrayed the trust of her bed-ridden brother by plundering his life savings has been jailed for two years.

Christine Davies, 57, offered to take 
control of her brother Keith Hardman's finances in 2007 when he went into adult 
social care after suffering a stroke.

But Lancaster Crown Court yesterday heard how she stole £22,000 from her brother's money over the course of four years while he was in a care home.

Jailed: Christine Davies, 57, pictured left, has been sentenced to two years in prison after she admitted stealing £22,000 from her brother Keith Hardman, right, who entrusted her with his finances after suffering a stroke

Speaking after the court case, Mr Hardman, 62, said: 'I never want to see her again, I can't forgive her. That was my money, I earned that. I'm never going to get my money back - that is what I wanted most.'

Mr Hardman, a former gas worker, was admitted into adult social care in 2006 following a stroke which left him with limited speech and movement.

A year later Davies offered to help her brother by taking control of his finances but then stole his money to spend herself.

Last month Davies pleaded guilty to stealing £22,000 from her brother. A total of £37,500 was unaccounted for, the court heard.

Speaking with the help of carers, he told of the shock of discovering his own sister had been stealing from him as he lay unaware in his care home bed.

It wasn't until an anonymous letter was sent to police that Davies' deceit was uncovered, a letter which Mr Hardman says he will always be thankful for.

Before being caught, Davies frequently told Mr Hardman he didn't have the money for treats or trips out of the home.

Davies managed to swindle thousands from the hard-working Manchester United fan's bank account.

Mr Hardman said: 'I was angry. I was shocked. I was upset.'

Betrayed: Keith Hardman, 62, says he will never forgive his sister who took control of his finances when he went into adult care and then stole thousands of pounds of his money

The court was told that during the four years she stole the money from her brother his income was £77,000.

Police financial investigators worked 
out about £40,000 of this had been spent 'legitimately' by Davies on 
buying items for her brother.

However, more than £37,500 was unaccounted for. Davies admitted stealing £22,000 of this.

Judge Tony Lancaster said he had to send Davies to prison in light of the 'serious nature of the breach of trust'.

DC Lindsey Bolton, lead officer on the 
case, said after the hearing: 'This is a serious crime of financial 
abuse on a vulnerable adult.

'The victim in this case is bed bound, he has suffered multiple strokes and can only 
communicate with gestures and limited 
words. He had placed trust in his sister in order to sort out his 
finances for his care, as his disability and health had prevented him 
from doing it.

'The crime first came to the attention 
of the police when there was an outstanding bill for the victim's care 
at the nursing home. This debt could have influenced the amount of care 
he could receive even though he had sufficient money of his own to pay 
for it. Unbeknown to him the money had been spent by the defendant.'

Since her arrest Mr Hardman has refused to see his scheming sister but has received a Christmas card.

Since Davies' crimes have been uncovered, staff at the home claim the terrible discovery has given Mr Hardman a new lease of life and he has started to treat himself and take part in social trips to the zoo and the cinema.
