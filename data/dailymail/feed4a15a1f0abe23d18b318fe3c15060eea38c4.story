It is the incredible story of a young First World War pilot who showed extraordianry bravery in  shooting down three enemy planes while wearing his pyjamas.

Flight Lieutenant Alan Jerrard was in bed asleep when an order suddenly came through for a sortie on an enemy aerodrome.

The 20-year-old pilot only had enough time to put his flying suit on over his pyjamas before taking off in his single-seat Sopwith Camel biplane and attacking the Germans.

Awarded a Victoria Cross for his exploits, Fl Lt Jerrard was also handed a commemorative silver bowl which is now being offered for sale by auction.

He shot down one aircraft before attacking the aerodrome from just 50ft, destroying a second plane taking off to win the VC. He then claimed a third kill when he attacked another plane that was on the tail of a comrade.

Fl Lt Jerrard was injured in the attack and his plane was damaged so he was forced to crash land and was taken prisoner by the Austro-Hungarians.

He went on to escape from a Prisoner of War Camp in Salzburg, Austria, and along with his VC, he was later presented with the silver-gilt punch bowl by his former regiment.

The 10lbs bowl that stands on a plinth at 20 inches tall, has been passed down through his family and is now being sold.

Auctioneers at Woolley and Wallis in Salisbury, Wilts, have given it a pre-sale estimate of £12,000.

Rupert Slingsby, from the auctioneers, said: 'The bowl is a fine Edwardian piece that would probably be worth about £4,000 but because of its association with a VC hero it could go for three times that sum.

'Alan Jerrard was the winner of the so-called "Pyjama VC" and his story is one of the most remarkable of World War I.

'He enjoyed the distinction of being the only aerial Victoria Cross recipient of the long and bitter campaign fought on the Italian Front during World War I.

'In October 1917 Italy was in need of desperate military assistance against the Austro-Hungarian empire.

'Despite numerous RAF operations including many dogfights, only one VC was awarded for action in the air during that final year-long phase of the campaign.

Veteran: Flight Lieutenant Alan Jerrard, 20, who escaped from a Prisoner of War Camp in Salzburg, Austria, during World War I

'On March 30, 1918 Jerrard shot down three enemy planes and launched a courageous attack, flying as low as 50 feet, on an enemy aerodrome, successfully strafing planes as they tried to take off.

'He only withdrew when ordered to do so by his patrol leader and he was then pursued by five enemy aircraft.

'However he crash-landed west of Mansue aerodrome, where he was captured and later interrogated by the enemy.

'When Jerrard was captured, he was wearing only his pyjamas beneath his bulky flying suit.

'That morning the weather had been unsuitable for flying. When Jerrard was suddenly ordered up, he had been asleep and had to dress so rapidly that he simply pulled his flying overalls over his pyjamas.'

Fl Lt Jerrard died at his home in Lyme Regis, Dorset in 1968. His exploits and those of his fellow Royal Flying Corps pilots were carried out without the benefit of parachutes, which were not introduced for aviators until the very end of the war.

The silver punch bowl, that is decorated with cherubs and has lion heads as handles, is inscribed: 'To Lieutenant Alan JErrard, V.C., the first Member of the Staffordshire territorial force to Win the Honour.

'...in recognition of a great service and in appreciation of a very gallant action.'

The sale takes place on July 18 in Salisbury.
