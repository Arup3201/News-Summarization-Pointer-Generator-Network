Stephen Myler was acclaimed on Friday night for becoming only the second Northampton player to score 2,000 points, but Newcastle gave the champions an almighty fright with a gloriously spirited and daring performance.

The Franklin’s Gardens crowd had come to witness a massacre, but it didn’t materialise. The home fans accorded their England fly-half a thunderous ovation when he reached his personal landmark – emulating the club’s record scorer, Paul Grayson – but they were soon gripped by tension as the visitors took the Aviva Premiership leaders to the wire.

Newcastle simply would not lie down. When Myler departed they were 32-10 down, but far from fading away, they launched a stirring late rear-guard action which eventually brought them a bonus point for scoring four tries.

Dean Richards’ team were adventurous, organised and competitive. While individuals such as Mark Wilson, Chris Harris and Tom Catterick stood out, the overall impression was of a well-coached side armed with attacking cohesion and the fearlessness of youth.

By the end, Newcastle had really shaken the title holders and Richards said: ‘We’ve got a good crop of youngsters coming through and they just want to have a go. They are given free licence to do that and their flair and skill came out. They are holding their own in the top flight. There are things we have to tighten up but when we do that, we will win a lot more games.’

The former Test No 8 is particularly delighted with the form of his player in that shirt – Wilson, adding: ‘He has been playing well enough to earn recognition from England soon.’

Northampton were far from their best but this was another bonus-point win to continue their title defence. Myler passed the 2,000-point mark by claiming a try, three conversions and two penalties last night. He touched down at the end of a sensational first-half move involving slick running and inter-play between Ben Foden and the Pisi brothers – Ken and George.

Newcastle hit back as Harris touched down after strong charges from Andy Tuilagi and Wilson, and a deft kick through by Catterick, only for some similarly fancy footwork by Myler at the other end to create a try for George Pisi, which put the Saints back on track.

The second half was surreal. After another Myler penalty, Foden and Ken Pisi combined to set up a try for Calum Clark and just before the hour came a penalty try for the hosts as Newcastle dragged down a maul close to their line. But once Myler had departed, the tables turned.

A strong lineout drive by the Falcons pack yielded a try for George McGuigan and moments later, Harris surged into space and Tom Penny’s pass sent Alex Tait over for his side’s third try. 

Back came the Saints with North’s left-wing run paving the way for Luther Burrell to score, but the last word went to the defiant visitors, as the Newcastle forwards drove Richard Mayhew over for a deserved bonus.

Jim Mallinder, the Saints’ director of rugby, paid fitting tribute to his No 10 points machine, saying: ‘Stephen has been here longer than I have and he is still playing well and kicking goals. To get to that milestone is phenomenal.’
