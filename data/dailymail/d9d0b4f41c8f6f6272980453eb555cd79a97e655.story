If you are excited about Christmas, look away now.

Serial object destroyer Alan Sailer, from California, has turned his twisted attention to exploding much-loved toys.

The high-speed photography fanatic has selected children's favourites and destroyed them with firecrackers.

And thanks to his 
photographic expertise, the 57-year-old has managed to capture the 
moment the poor playthings were blown apart.

Unfortunate toys and characters include a Mickey Mouse mug blowing its top, Tweety Pie losing his head, a troll head cracking up and a Rubik's Cube exploding into pieces.

Mr Sailer, from Camarillo, California, explains: 'The poor defenseless toys are common so I pick them up from garage sales. I try my best to keep the costs under a dollar per shot.

'I will admit that it is fun to mess with toy archetypes. I have to smile when an icon of sweet innocence like My Little Pony crumbles to pieces in rather horrifying way.'

To blow up the objects Alan uses a firecracker modified so that it can be fired using an electrical signal.

Mr Sailer said he smiles when toys such as dolls (left) and My Little Pony (right) are destroyed in a 'horrifying way'

It is not just toys like Dora the Explorer (left) that fall foul of Mr Sailer's wrath. A Christmas ornament gets the explosion treatment too

He then has to synchronise the opening of the camera shutter with the explosion. It does not need to be really accurate, but it does need to be better than lighting a fuse.

'The camera is unimportant, it's not a special camera. I use a Nikon D90 for most of my shots. I have also used an old Nikon F3 film camera, a Canon G6, Rebel XT etc.

'The camera must have a manual focus and manual settings is all.

'The flash is the key, that and the detector/trigger.

'I use a home built flash based on a model built in the 1950s by Harold Edgerton.

'The flash is really fast about 1 millionth of a second and it stops the action.

'The detector/trigger is also critical.

'It detects that the debris from the explosion has arrived and fires the flash at just the right moment.'

And it is not just toys which appear to test Mr Sailer's patience.

The eccentric photographer has in the past turned his lens, and his gun, to a range of different foods, shooting items such as Brussel Sprouts and Camembert cheese at close range and catching the fall out on camera.Â 

The artist's studio looks like something from a horror film

Even the Polaroid camera was not safe from his explosion obsession
