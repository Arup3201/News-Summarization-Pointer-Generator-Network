Michael Moore has confirmed that Clint Eastwood had previously threatened his life as the fallout between the pair continues after the filmmaker criticized the director's movie, American Sniper.  

Writing on his Facebook page, the documentary maker said Eastwood made the comments in January 2005 - '10 years ago this week' at the National Board of Review Awards dinner.

Moore said Eastwood announced 'to me and to the crowd that he would 'kill' me if I ever came to his house with my camera for an interview.  

'I'll kill you,' he declared.'

At the time Eastwood was being honored for his film Million Dollar Baby. He made the comments after referring to Moore's on-camera confrontation with then-National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston in his documentary Bowling For Columbine.

Speaking from the stage, Eastwood Said: 'Michael Moore and I actually have a lot in common. 

'We both appreciate living in a country where there's free expression. But, Michael, if you ever show up at my front door with a camera, I'll kill you.'

Moore said he laughed nervously along with the rest of the audience. He assumed, Eastwood was joking.

He wrote: Having just experienced a half-dozen assaults in the previous year from crazies upset at 'Fahrenheit 9/11' and my anti-war Oscar speech, plus the attempt by a right wing extremist to blow up my house (he was caught in time and went to prison), I was a bit stunned to hear Eastwood, out of the blue, make such a violent statement. But I instantly decided he was just trying to be funny, so I laughed the same nervous laugh everyone else did. Clint, though, didn't seem to like all that laughter.

'I mean it,' he barked, and the audience grew more quiet. 'I'll shoot you.'

Moore said there was a 'smattering of approving applause', but most people simply turned around to check his reaction.

Eastwood's movie American Sniper has been a box-office hit but has sparked widespread debate; the director is pictured above at the AFL Awards in Los Angeles earlier this month,

He said: 'I tried to keep that fake smile on my face so as to appear as if he hadn't 'gotten' to me. But he had. I then mumbled to those sitting at my table. 'I think Dirty Harry just said, "Make my day, punk.'''

Moore sparked a flurry of debate after he spoke out on Twitter following the release of Eastwood's box-office record beating American Sniper, calling snipers 'cowards'.

Sarah Palin was one of many high-profile people to defend the film calling out Moore for his 'disrespect' of U.S. troops.

While attending the Iowa Freedom Summit last week, the former vice presidential candidate posed with Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Meyer, who held up a sign reading 'F*** you Michael Moore'. 

In his Facebook page, Moore goes on to say that Eastwood is a 'great filmmaker' and that his movie 'Unforgiven' is his favorite Western of all time, before then proceeding to attack him further.

He writes: 'But something started to go haywire with Clint in the last decade.' He cites Eastwood casting himself in 'Gran Tarino' and his staging of a conversation with an invisible Barack Obama two years later at a Republican National Convention.

He then heaps more criticizim on American Sniper which he calls a 'mess of a film that rewrites history' and perpetrates a 'racist sentiment to Arabs'.

Moore said in the coming days he will share 'some thoughtful pieces' on American Sniper, by others, as well as 'my real thoughts' on it. 

He concludes by writing that what was 'bothersome' about Eastwood's remarks was that he was backing up earlier comments made by TV show host Glenn Beck who has said he was thinking of 'killing Michael Moore'. Similar comments were also made by Fox News's Bill O'Reilly. 

Moore wrote: 'This past week or so of hysterical attacks on me only proves that the American lovers of violence and the issuers of fatwas in OUR society haven't gone away. They are our American Isis - "Criticize or mock those whom we deify, like our sainted sniper, and we will harm you most assuredly.'''
