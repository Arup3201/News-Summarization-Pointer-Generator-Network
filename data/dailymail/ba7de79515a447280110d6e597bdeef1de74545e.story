A mother whose young son nearly died after a SWAT team broke into the home where they were staying and threw a flashbang grenade in the sleeping child's crib has spoken out about abuse of power by police officers.

Alecia Phonesavanh was staying with her husband, their three daughters and their baby son Bounkham in the living room of her sister-in-law's home just outside of Atlanta after their Wisconsin home burnt down.

As the family slept, a SWAT team descended on the home, breaking down the door and throwing a flashbag grenade inside, which landed in 19-month-old Bounkham's crib.

Horror: Little Bou Phonesavanh, pictured right before and left after, was severely injured by a grenade during a police raid in May

'Flashbang grenades were created for 
soldiers to use during battle. When they explode, the noise is so loud 
and the flash is so bright that anyone close by is temporarily blinded 
and deafened,' wrote Alecia Phonesavanh on Salon.com.

Police did not allow Phonesavanh to see her son, who was carried from the home by an officer and taken to hospital.

All the Phonesavanhs could see of their son was a pool of blood on the pavement.

The child was seriously injured and placed in a medically induced coma in Grady Memorial Hospital's burn unit.  

'He's
 in the burn unit. We go up to see him and his whole face is ripped 
open. He has a big cut on his chest,' Phonesavanh said. 'He's only 19 
months old. He didn't do anything.'

 injuries are too graphic to share though one shows burns all over his 
face.

Cornelia Police Chief Rick Darby confirmed the raid took place at the home just before 3 a.m.

He said a multi-jurisdictional drug unit issued a warrant and organized the SWAT operation.

Baby Bou Bou, as he is known by his 
family, was only taken out of his induced coma three days ago. He still 
has a huge open wound on his chest that exposes his ribs, which 
Phonesavanh can't bring herself to look at.

'He
 has lost his left nipple from the explosion. He still has a pretty big 
hole in his chest. I personally have not looked at it. I don't think I 
could handle it. I would probably lose my mind as a mother,' she said 
told HuffPost.

Doctors
 are unable to tell the family whether Bou Bou has suffered any lasting 
brain damage. He has been transferred to another hospital for 
rehabilitation.

Shocked: The child's mother, Alecia Phonesavanh, pictured, is in shock after what happened to her baby who is still recovering and may have suffered permanent brain damage

Phonesavanh says the SWAT team was looking for her husband's nephew, who doesn't live in the home. They searched for drugs in the home and did not find any.

The family has a webpage where people can donate to Bou Bou's rehabilitation and support the family's efforts to publicize the abuse of power by police officers that is happening all over the country.

'This is happening every day to people [who are] being relentlessly and unnecessarily militarized by police who think just because they're supposed to be upholding the law, they are above the law themselves,' Phonesavanh told Huffpost.

'It’s time to remind the cops that they should be serving and protecting our neighborhoods, not waging war on the people in them.'
