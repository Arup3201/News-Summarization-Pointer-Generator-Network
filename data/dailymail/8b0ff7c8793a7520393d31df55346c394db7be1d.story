A lottery winner who quit his factory job to go on a £72,000 round-the-world pub crawl with his best friends has returned to the UK to find he can't get a mortgage. 

Matt Myles took his brother, Pete, and three of his friends on an eight-month holiday after winning £1million in April. 

After spending nearly eight months visiting seven countries, the 28-year-old has returned home to Hereford where he has had to buy a house outright after being turned down for a mortgage. 

Matt Myles spent £72,000 on alcohol during a round-the-world pub crawl with his best friends and brother after scooping £1million in the lottery in April. Above, at the beginning of his trip in Bali 

The party didn't stop once back on home soil where Mr Myles spent thousands flying two DJs from Ibiza to Hereford for his Great Gatsby themed bash

Speaking of his £72,000 bar bill, Mr Myles said: 'The money has been mostly spent on the p****'. I mean, why wouldn't you?'  

'We got through £80,000 in less than eight months. I would say about 90 per cent of that was spent going on the razz.

'We basically tried to do a night on, a night off the sauce, but most of the time it was night on, night on, night on.

'In America we did drinking games with fratboys. People call it pre-gaming; when you start drinking before you go out to a bar.

'So we were trying to teach them English drinking games. 

'I would say America was my favourite purely because it is English speaking.' 

After picking up his £1million cheque in April, Mr Myles paid for the group to fly to Bali where they spent ten days before moving on to Thailand. 

The boys spent five weeks island hopping in the popular tourist country before jetting to Brazil for the World Cup.

Ibiza followed, with Mr Myles spending £7,000 in one of the island's most popular nightclubs, Space. 

They then spent three weeks in Spain before flying to Italy. Their trip was rounded off in America, where they spent five weeks in New York, Washington DC, Chicago, Miami and New Orleans. 

Bali - Thousands spent on a luxury hilltop villa and bottles of 2003 vintage Dom Perignon 

Thailand - Elephant Trekking, visits to tiger enclosures and the infamous Full Moon Party

Brazil -  Four weeks watching the World Cup with his friends and brother 

Ibiza - £7,000 in Space, the bar tab for 12 friends and a luxury villa for everyone for one week 

Spain -  Three weeks of drinking and tanning with his friends and brother 

Tuscany -  A luxury villa for two weeks for the rest of the family

America - £4,000 in a New York nightclub and thousands in Washington DC, New Orleans and elsewhere 

Speaking of the Big Apple, Mr Myles said: 'The only way to describe New York is London on crack. 

'Everyone is going a million miles an hour.

'It is expensive in New York. We spent £4,500 just to get in and sit at a table in one place in New York.

'It was one of the best nights I have ever had in my life. It was insane.' 

The extravagance didn't stop once the boys were back on home soil, with Mr Myles splashing out for a Great Gatsby themed birthday party in September. 

'For my birthday in September, we threw a Great Gatsby party for 350 people. 

There were champagne showers. I had a 12 litre bottle of Veuve (Clicquot).

'I flew two DJs in from Ibiza. We had this massive marquee next to Kentchurch Court in Herefordshire.' 

But the former engineer's long-term plans were stunted when he was turned down for mortgages due to a pre-existing poor credit rating.   

He now plans to spend £150,000 on buying a property outright. 

Eventually the group had to come home before they did serious damage to their health, the millionaire said

The good life: Despite having an 'insane' time with his brother and friends, Mr Myles admitted the group had to come home to 'grow up'. He is pictured in New York (left) and in Bali (right)

As well as buying a house in Hereford, Mr Myles has splashed out on a Porsche and an Omega watch

'We had to come home for the sake of our livers,' he said. 

'We had an amazing time but we all had to come home and grow up, I’ve got to buy a house and we couldn't carry on much longer without doing ourselves serious damage.  

'I was going to buy a load of houses with mortgages and then get people into rent them to pay for the mortgage.

'But mortgage lenders don’t see the interest of an investment as income so, in effect I am a millionaire, but I can’t even get a mortgage.'
