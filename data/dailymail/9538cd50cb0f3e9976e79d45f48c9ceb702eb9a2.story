A Utah grandmother who was left fighting for her life after unwittingly drinking poisoned iced tea at a barbecue chain has reached a settlement with the firm, it was today revealed.

Jan Harding, 67, was rushed to hospital in a critical condition after swallowing the mixture of iced tea and lye, an industrial cleaning solution, at Dickey's Barbecue Pit in South Jordan, Salt Lake City. 

She was forced to undergo two weeks of treatment for severe internal damage, including deep, ulcerated burns in her upper esophagus and mouth, before being released on August 20.

Now, the married mother-of-three has agreed on a deal with Dickey's that will apparently lead to extensive changes at the business to ensure such an incident never happens again.

Reaction: Instantly, Mrs Harding realizes something is wrong and hunches over a trash can, vomiting up the drink (left). Her husband then arrives by her side (right) and she is rushed to the University of Utah Hospital

In a joint statement, Mrs Harding and the chain said they had come to an out-of-court settlement, but refused to disclose how much money the victim had received, nor any details of the deal.

'Everyone involved is grateful that Ms. Harding has made a good recovery,' the statement said.

In October, new footage was revealed showing a worker at the chain accidentally mixing lye - instead of sugar - into an iced tea dispenser just minutes before the near-fatal incident.

Lye, an odorless chemical that looks like sugar, is used for degreasing deep fryers and is the active ingredient in Drano. When swallowed, it can tighten and burn the esophagus and lead to death.

Desperate: Now, the married mother-of-three (pictured trying to flush the toxic chemical out of her mouth with a glass of water) has reached a settlement with Dickey's. She has received an undisclosed sum of money

Mrs Harding, who was donning a bright green top and a black skirt, was then caught on surveillance camera sweetening her iced tea at the dispenser, before taking a single sip.

Instantly, she realized something was wrong and hunched over a trash can, vomiting up the drink. A fellow customer a store manager stopped to check on her, but she continued to throw up. 

After her husband arrived by her side and spoke to members of staff, Mrs Harding was rushed to the University of Utah Hospital, where doctors carried out an endoscopy.  

This involved inserting a tube with a light and camera into the grandmother's digestive tract, to assess the damage - and it was worst than medics initially thought.

Scene: In September, prosecutors chose not to file charges in the incident at the Dickey's branch in South Jordan (pictured) saying there were errors and mishaps, but no evidence of any criminal wrongdoing.

She was forced to undergo extensive treatment for the burns in both her upper esophagus and mouth and could not speak for the majority of her time in hospital, her family lawyer Paxton Guymon said.

Because Mrs Harding was the first one to drink from the batch of tea, no one else was harmed.

Although Mrs Harding and her family apparently accepted the decision by Salt Lake County Attorney Sim Gill, they were determined to work with Dickey's to implement new, safer procedures.

Survivor: Mrs Harding is pictured with her husband following the August incident, which nearly killed her

The new deal between Mrs Harding and the chain was first reported by KSTU-TV in Salt Lake City.

The Dallas-based Dickey's Barbecue Restaurants Inc. has since said the incident was isolated and unprecedented in the chain's 73-year history. 

The company now has more than 400 restaurants across the country.
