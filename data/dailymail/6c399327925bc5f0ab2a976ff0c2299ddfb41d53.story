Many hopefuls find themselves under pressure when it comes to conjuring up an original way of proposing.

But one romantic boyfriend pulled out all the stops when he asked for his girlfriend's hand in marriage - by writing out his proposal in 15ft letters on a beach in Guensey.

Jeremy Curtis, 39, scouted remote coastal spots across the UK before coming up with the ideal location.

He enlisted a team of local volunteers to help carve the massive message in the dunes - complete with giant love hearts.

then took girlfriend Jennifer Ayris, 31, for a romantic stroll on a 
clifftop in Guernsey where she spotted the message 'Jen, will you marry 
me?' below.

She immediately went down to the shore and carved her answer: 'yes'.

Relieved Jeremy, an IT consultant from Sheffield, had spent weeks planning the proposal.

Girlfriend Jennifer Ayris, 31, spotted it from a clifftop overlooking Petit Port beach on the Channel Island of Guernsey and immediately ran down and wrote 'yes' next to it

Jeremy waited until she spotted the message and then got down on one knee - she immediately said yes

He eventually picked Petit Port beach on the Channel Island of Guernsey, then he rounded up helpers using Twitter and a local newspaper.

His cries for help were answered by eleven people who came forward to clear the beach of seaweed.

The final touches - love hearts, swirls and the date - were finished just as Jeremy and Jennifer's holiday cruise ship docked in Guernsey.

Jeremy said: 'I put plenty of suncream on when I visited Guernsey to plan the proposal as I didn't want to return to the UK with a tan and give the game away.

'When it came to the big day we got off the boat and I walked Jen along the cliff path until we could see a little bit of the beach, then asked her to put on a blindfold.

'After walking her a little farther I got down on one knee and told her she could take it off.

'The moment she saw the message she burst into tears and said yes.'

Jeremy's friends had even laid on a romantic picnic for the couple at the top of the cliff.

The couple then climbed down to the beach where Jennifer, a solicitor, added the word 'yes' to the message.

They went in search of the volunteers to thank them in person but the group had disappeared to give them privacy

Jennifer said: 'I don't think it has even sunk in yet. It could not have been any better.'

Jeremy and Jennifer, who have been together for three years, plan to get married next year

The couple want to shake each and every one of the volunteers' hands to say thank you for their kind efforts

Jeremy added: 'The people who helped me were not artists, they were just regular people.

'I hadn't seen the message in advance and I had no idea how well it would turn out - but it was better than I could have possibly imagined.

'The fact that it was all done by volunteers who didn't know me is totally overwhelming.

'It's just a shame I didn't get to thank them all in person or shake their hands.'

The couple were on a cruise with Jeremy's parents, brother, sister-in-law and two young nephews to celebrate his mum's 65th birthday.
