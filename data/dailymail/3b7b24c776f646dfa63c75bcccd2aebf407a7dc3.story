Carl Froch may have just defended his IBF and WBA super-middleweight titles in front of 80,000 people at Wembley, but Joe Calzaghe remains unimpressed.

The Cobra beat George Groves on arguably the biggest night in British boxing history with an eighth round knockout last Saturday, bringing him to 12 successive world title fights.

But Calzaghe, who retired undefeated in 2008 after victories over American greats Bernard Hopkins and Roy Jones Jnr on US soil, thinks the man he never fought doesn't deserve such high praise.

Not a member: Joe Calzaghe says The Cobra (pictured) is a 'top fighter, but not member of the elite'

Winner: Calzaghe retired in 2008 undefeated and has been put into the International Boxing Hall of Fame

Pundits tend to favour Calzaghe when asked who would win a hypothetical fight between the Pride of Wales and Nottingham’s finest, though Froch can arguably point to the more impressive CV.

But Calzaghe says there is no debate to be had, insisting Froch isn’t in his league and arguing his potential fight with Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr would be a mistake.

‘A lot of people make comparisons to Carl Froch’s career to mine, but I don’t think there’s a comparison,’ he told Wales Online.

‘I was undefeated, went to America and conquered America. I defeated two legends out there at different weights.

‘I was the number one fighter, the number one champion at super-middleweight and light-heavyweight.

‘Froch has gone out to America and lost where he was bossed by Andre Ward.’

Opinionated: Calzaghe thinks Froch will never be truly great unless he goes back and finishes off Andre Ward

TOTAL FIGHTS: 35

WINS: 33

WINS BY KO: 24

LOSSES: 2 (Mikkel Kessler, Andre Ward)

Calzaghe, who is being inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame, believes Froch needs to finish off Ward before he can come close to his own legacy.

‘He is speaking about going out there to fight Chavez, but what does that mean? He is a top fighter, but not a member of the elite.

‘If you are going to fight in America, go and fight the best guy and try and beat him. And the champion is Andre Ward.

‘But I don’t think Froch has the ability to do that. He has obviously had a great career. He’s fought 12 world title fights in a row which is very good for a fighter.

‘I fought 24 world title fights in a row. Take nothing away from him. At the end of the day I’m in the Hall of Fame this week.’
