Jubilant:Winner Yoo Ye-bin, a college student took the crown in Seoul today

After months of preparation there can only be one winner and today a 21-year-old student beat 54 other participants to win Miss Korea.

Winner Yoo Ye-bin, a college student took the crown in Seoul today.

She will now go on to represent South Korea for this year's Miss Universe beauty pageant.

The 20 finalists already hit the headlines this year when their photos were posted on Reddit fuelling 
speculation that many of them had undergone surgery and prompting users 
to criticise the Asian nation's growing trend to go under the knife.

South Koreans currently have more plastic surgery than in any other 
country according to recent figures, with the craze particularly popular
among 19 to 49-year-olds.

The popularity of surgery, 
particularly among the young, has been blamed by some on a desire to 
look more 'western' fuelled by an obsession with celebrity culture.

All
of the women vying for the crown of Miss Korea 2013 have dark, 
perfectly trussed hair, either tumbling over their shoulders or neatly 
tied up, pale skin, bright eyes and a perfect bright white smile.

And
their apparent similarity prompted Reddit user ShenTheWise to post 
their pictures online, suggesting that many of those vying for the Miss 
Korea title this year have had similar surgery.

He captioned the image: 'Korea’s plastic surgery mayhem is finally converging on the same face.'

The post saw more than 3,000 people comment in response, debating the merits of widespread plastic surgery.

Reddit
user HotBrownie, who claims to hail from Seoul, said: :  'Those women 
in fact do look unnervingly similar and yes, Koreans think so too.

'This
is called the Korean plastic face look. In certain areas of Seoul, you 
would think all the women are sisters because they look so similar due 
to same surgeries.

'Without the plastic surgery, korean women are very diverse looking and easily can be told apart.

'The surgery takes away their 
individuality and uniqueness and its sad. Most are beautiful without it 
but telling them that their Korean ethnic features are in fact lovely is
as effective as screaming at a brick wall.

'They
wont believe you because they've been brainwashed to think 
westernization of their features is superior, I don't think they want to
look white, but a mix of white and Asian and definitely less Korean.'

Another
Reddit user, Forevertraveling, added: 'I live in Korea and older women 
complain how girls don't look Korean anymore because of all the plastic 
surgery.

'It's so common to the point if I meet a girl, I just assume she has had something done.

'Girls here consider eye surgery just like using make up. '

But
others on the social networking site said that all the pictures served 
to prove was that there is a 'cultural divide' between the east and west
in terms of plastic surgery.

HerpDerpDrone
commented: 'Western women want to exaggerate their features with 
plastic surgeries (fuller lips, bigger boobs, bigger butts) while Asian 
women want to refine their features (smaller chins etc) so there is 
definitely a cultural divide when it comes to plastic surgery.'

The pageant sparked controversy last 
year when pictures emerged of winner Kim Yu-Mi before she had undergone 
plastic surgery, with many claiming that cosmetic procedures give 
contestants an unfair advantage.

The
student revealed her plastic surgery secret after photos emerged of her
looking very different at school, but she said she hadn't misled 
anyone.

But she defended her crown telling the Korean media: 'I never said I was born beautiful.'

South Koreans have more plastic surgery than any other nation according to figures released in January.

Congratulations: Yoo Ye-bin is congratulated by contestants during the contest

Those
in the Asian country have more treatments per members of the 
population, with one in every 77 turning to the knife or needle.

The
figures, from the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons 
(ISAPS), show that in 2011, 15 million people across the globe turned to
plastic surgery to enhance their looks.

While the popularity of cosmetic surgery in South Korea may come as a surprise to many, the industry there is in fact booming.

Last year, 20 per cent of women aged 19 to 49 in the capital city of Seoul admitted to going under the knife.

One
of the most popular surgical procedures is double eyelid surgery - 
which reduces excess skin in the upper eyelid to make the eyes appear 
bigger and make them look more 'Western'.

It
is believed that the rise of the country's music industry is behind the
boom, and many patients visit clinics with photos of celebrities, 
asking surgeons to emulate American noses or eyes.

Singer PSY, whose song 'Gangnam Style' became a global hit, said his record label had urged him to get plastic surgery.
