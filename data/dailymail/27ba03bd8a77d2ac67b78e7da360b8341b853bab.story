Members of the Saudi Arabian royal family have attacked a new film which portrays the founder and first king of their country as a bloodthirsty womaniser.

Prince
 Talal bin Abdul-Aziz, the twentieth son of Ibn Saud, whose rise to power is shown in the film King of the Sands, said the film could 'tarnish' his father's name and said he would try to have it banned.

But the film opened amid controversy in the Syrian capital, Damascus, on Thursday 12 December, attended by hundreds of high-profile guests.

By the sword: King of the Sands shows Ibn Saud, who founded modern Saudi Arabia, leading a bloody military campaign

Amorous: The film also portrays the Saudi king-to-be as a womaniser

The premiere took place despite the civil war in Syria, though several mortar shells were said to have exploded not far from the venue during the screening.

Showing the film so publicly has been said to mark a low-point in relations between Syria and Saudi Arabia, with Saudi royals attacking the Assad regime for allowing the film, and Syrian ministers accusing the Saudis of funding rebel fighters.

King
 of the Sands is directed by Najdat Anzour, one of Syria's best-known 
producers and most acclaimed directors, who is also a supporter of President Assad.

The
 film, which purports to show events leading up to the creation of Saudi Arabia in 1932, was also shown at a private screening in London on 11 September, a date which some has said was chosen to highlight alleged links between Saudi Arabia and the 9/11 terror attacks.

In
 the film, King Abdul-Aziz Al Saud, later commonly known as Ibn Saud, is portrayed as a merciless ruler 
who kills opponents in sword fights, orders that thieves have their hands cut off, stones those who have pre-marital sex, takes multiple wives for himself and deflowers virgins.

In one scene, the character, played by Italian actors Fabio Testi and Marco Foschi, asks: 'What's 
wrong with blood? A kingdom is only taken with blood.'

War: The film shows some of the fierce fighting which led to the foundation of the Saudi state

Controversy: Director Najdat Anzour says he has received death threats as a result of the film

Taboo: The film is especially controversial as the Saudi rulers are rarely criticised publicly in the Middle East

He then says: 'The sultan will 
never be obeyed but by the sword.'

Meanwhile a narrator says: 'A sword was raised for the sake of the kingdom and the sultan making the sand soaked with blood'.

Elements of the film also imply that Ibn Saud was susceptible to British influence, particularly after oil was discovered in Saudi Arabia.

The film is especially controversial because the Saudi rulers are not generally criticised in public in the Arab world. The Saudi king is also a significant figure in Islam, as he is custodian of Mecca and Medina, the religion's two holiest places.

Reputation: Children of Ibn Saud, shown here in 1934, have said the film must not be allowed to 'tarnish' his memory

In response to the screening, which has been promoted on Syrian state television, Prince
 Talal bin Abdul-Aziz Tweeted a statement explaining that he was trying to persuade President Assad to ban the film.

He said: 'I hope he 
responds positively in honouring King Abdul-Aziz as a person. We cannot let such unsuccessful works tarnish the
 image of a great historical figure like King Abdul-Aziz.'

Fadia
 Kiwan, a political science professor at St Joseph University in Beirut,
 said the screening may bring Syria-Saudi relations 'to the point of no return.'

Since the Syrian rebellion began in 2011, the two powers have been particularly fiercely opposed. The Saudi government led criticism of President Assad's treatment of protesters in Damascus, while Syria has complained to the UN about its alleged support for rebel fighters.

Last
 month, President Assad was quoted by state media saying: 'Saudi Arabia is 
leading the widest sabotage campaign in the Arab world.' He also accused them of paying rebels $2,000 a month each to fight government forces.

Ali Haidar, a Syrian cabinet minister, said: 'Personally,
 I strongly encourage this movie. Relations might mend once Saudi 
Arabia corrects its policy, halts its support of terrorism and 
apologizes for what had happened in Syria.'
