After a dour first half, Everton and Leicester City shared four goals between them after the break in a pulsating final half hour at Goodison Park. 

Steven Naismith fired the Toffees into the lead in the 57th minute with a scuffed effort. Everton's opening goal forced Nigel Pearson into action with the Foxes boss springing Jamie Vardy and David Nugent from the bench. 

The duo made an immediate impact as Vardy set up Nugent for the equaliser. Esteban Cambiasso pounced from close range to put the visitors in front but Matthew Upson's own goal earned Everton a late draw.

A frantic finish at Goodison as Everton clear the lines. 

The Foxes looked on course for victory after Nigel Pearson's inspired double substitution of Jamie Vardy and David Nugent. Romelu Lukaku put a tough afternoon behind him to salvage a point for his side. 

The Toffees stay in 12th in the table as chorus of boos rings out at Goodison. 

Atsu has a go but Schwarzer saves well as Everton get a corner. 

Lukaku gets onto the end of Baines' delivery but Upson makes a superb block

It's been a torrid half for Lukaku but he makes amends with a wonderful finish. 

Atsu latches onto McCarthy's inviting pass and crosses for Lukaku who heads home from close range to even the scores once more. A fine finish from him after a difficult outing at Goodison...

Baines fires in a low driving shot into the Leicester and Lukaku directs it goalwards but his placed ball drifts just the right of the goal. Three days ago, the Everton striker was scoring for fun. Today, he has never looked likely in front of goal. 

The Foxes are shutting up shop and are inviting Everton onto them as the home side chase an equaliser. 

Atsu gets free inside the box but he can't get a shot away with Coleman firing over from close range moments later. Fascinating final 10 minutes in store here...

The game now has a realistic scoreline and Nigel Pearson’s double substitution, injecting the pace of Jamie Vardy and the poaching of David Nugent, has reaped dividends. They have been given a considerable helping hand, however, by Tim Howard.

The normally assured American goalkeeper has fatally blundered twice and the mood around Goodison is boiling. Roberto Martinez will not be dissuaded from searching for goalkeeper cover in the summer.

Howard makes a mess of Simpson's cross from the right with Vardy latching onto the loose ball and firing goalwards and it's the Argentine veteran Cambiasso who pounces to give Leicester the lead here with 20 minutes remaining. 

Just to compound matters for Everton, Lukaku botches another chance on goal soon after. 

McCarthy plays a great pass to Lukaku but the striker blazes over the bar with just Mark Schwarzer to beat. It's been that kind of an afternoon for the Belgian today. 

Nigel Pearson sends on Jamie Vardy and David Nugent and the duo make their presence felt almost immediately! 

Riyad Mahrez and Jeff Schlupp were called ashore as Pearson went looking for an equaliser. 

Vardy makes a storming run down the right and strikes for goal. Howard did well to save his shot but Nugent shows great instincts to fire the ball in from close range. It's taken almost an hour, but this game has suddenly come to life. 

Did not see that coming. Everton in front with a scruffy goal from Steven Naismith but it was against the run of play.

Leicester had looked much the likelier side to score in the opening 12 minutes. Everton have made two substitutions, with Ross Barkley and Mo Besic being replaced by Darron Gibson and Christian Atsu.

The Besic replacement was unpopular with home fans, who booed the sight of his number being raised.

Not Steven Naismith's cleanest strike, but the Toffees won't be worrying too much about that. 

Lukaku showed great strength to hold off Upson and Morgan in the box before passing to Naismith. 

The Scottish forward fired a low shift which took a slight deflection off Huth to sneak in at the left post as the Goodison faithful finally find their voices. 

Roberto Martinez freshens up his midfield early on the second half 

Schlupp tees up Matty James on the edge of the Everton box who drives a low shot which is parried away by Howard. 

Schlupp seizes on the rebound but he delivers an awful shot with the goal at his mercy. That was a gilt-edged chance for Leicester to take the lead here. Will it come back to haunt them later on? 

A dour day on Merseyside so far. Roberto Martinez's side have looked dangerous on the break but have failed to create enough goal-scoring opportunities despite dominating for long periods of that first half. 

Nigel Pearson has set up us Leicester side to contain the Toffees and save for a few hairy moments , they have just that. Cambiasso has looked a class apart for the visitors but Lukaku needs to up his game in the second half...

Leicester play their way out from the back with Upson, Simpson, Cambiasso and Matty James all getting plenty of touches before Barkley intercepts and clears for a Foxes throw-in. 

Kramaric shows good strength to hold up posession in the Everton box but Besic disposesses the Leicester striker before laying the ball onto Barkley whose deft pass releases Lennon down the right. 

Lennon plays the ball to Lukaku but Upson blocks his effort before Barkley smashes the rebound high and wide. 

Coleman causes havoc down the right again and drives into the Leicester box before squaring the ball to Lukaku who fires over the bar. After his hat-trick heroics on Thursday, he'll be disappointed with that effort. 

Wes Morgan clatters into Steven Naismith and referee Phil Dowd reaches for the yellow card immediately. 

The Leicester centre back will need to be on his best behaviour for the rest of the contest. Not an ideal situation when you're marking Lukaku mind. 

Everton are awarded a free-kick on the edge of the Leicester area but Barkley blazes his effort over the Foxes wall and into Row Z. 

Great feet from Barkley there in a crowded midfield. The young Toffees midfielder drives forward and frees up Lukaku with clever, disguised pass but the Belgian is caught marginally offside with the Leicester goal at his mercy. Another let-off for Leicester. 

After a shaky start, Everton are looking far more assured here at Goodison with Besic, McCarthy and Barkley getting plenty of touches between them. Baines and Coleman are looking threatening and are getting forward with far more regularity. 

 

Coleman and Baines are being afforded acres of space by Leicester on the flanks. 

Baines gets free on the left and fires in a trademark cross and Lukaku beats Upson but his header goes high and wide. 

Ross Barkley picks up a loose ball outside his box and bombs forwards before playing a great pass to the onrushing Aaron Lennon on the right. The former Tottenham winger shows great pace down the right but his cross is snuffed out by the Leicester defence. 

An early warning for Leicester as Everton look dangerous on the break. 

Everton right back Seamus Coleman drives forward for the first time in the game and plays a lovely through ball to Steven Naismith but Huth is alive to the danger and clears well. 

Coleman gets free on the right again and plays the ball into the Foxes box but Morgan does well to intercept. 

Esteban Cambiasso does well to steal to steal possession from John Stones and lays the ball onto Jeff Schlupp who plays a lovely one-two with Riyad Mahrez before launching a strong right-footed shot which Tim Howard parries away for a corner. Everton clear the danger but the visitors will be happy with that early attack. 

Wes Morgan and Phil Jagielka are leading out their sides at Goodison. A huge clash awaits.

Leighton  Baines replaces Bryan Oviedo in the Everton team while Muhamed Besic and Aaron Lennon come in for Kevin Mirallas and the suspended Gareth Barry.

Rock-bottom Leicester make one change, with Robert Huth coming in for Marcin Wasilewski at centre-back.

Good afternoon and welcome to Sportsmail's live coverage of Everton vs Leicester City at a gloomy and wet Goodison Park.

Roberto Martinez's men will be buzzing follwing their 4-1 demolition of Young Boys in Europe on Thursday with Romelu Lukaku's hat-trick proving just the tonic for the Toffees.

Martinez will be hoping Lukaku can bring his cup form into the league. The Belgian strike has scored just once in 11 Premier League outings. The last time he scored? Everton's 1-0 victory at Crystal Palace which was the Merseysiders' sole victory in nine league games.

This is a must-win game for Nigel Pearson's side who have been bottom of the league since November. Leicester have been bottom of the table since November and are now five points from safety. An intriguing contest awaits...
