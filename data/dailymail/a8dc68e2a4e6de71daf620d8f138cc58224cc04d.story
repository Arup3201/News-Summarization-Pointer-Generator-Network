Football Association chairman Greg Dyke says Chelsea's criticism of the governing body's judgement in handing Nemanja Matic a two-match ban will not result in a change in the rules. 

Chelsea said they were 'appalled' by the FA's decision to ban Matic for pushing Burnley's Ashley Barnes while taking no action against the Clarets player for his challenge on the Serbian midfielder.

Referee Martin Atkinson said he saw Barnes' horror tackle - even though he did not give a foul - meaning the FA could not retrospectively act, drawing fierce criticism from the Barclays Premier League leaders and their manager Jose Mourinho.

Blues boss Mourinho claimed the FA 'lose credibility' by making such decisions, but Dyke brushed off Mourinho's barb, saying: 'I don't get involved in the politics that goes on in the game. Managers say all sorts of things either through disappointment or to get tactical advantage.

'I don't take it too seriously. If you think you've got something wrong, you should do something about it, but I don't think you should get involved in the week-to-week politics of football.

'We have seen it before and I have no doubt we will see it again. They followed the rules. Did the referee see the incident? He says yes. He decided not to take action. That's his decision. Therefore we had no part under our existing rules of getting involved with that because the referee had seen it and decided not to take action.

Dyke says the furore over the Matic-Barnes incident alone will not lead to the FA changing their rules

Matic's furious reaction earned him a three-match ban that was later reduced to two games by the FA 

'Are we going to re-look at the rules? Not on the basis of one. Over time? Maybe.'

Mourinho, who has complained about a perceived 'campaign' against Chelsea this season, said on Friday ahead of the Capital One Cup final against Tottenham: 'Strong credibility - this is something English football cannot lose. You lose credibility when a player like Matic is suspended, and another player can play this weekend.

'I don't think you can have any doubt that all around the world people open their mouths with surprise at how this can be possible.' 

Mourinho spoke out again on Friday about how he felt the English game was losing credibility
