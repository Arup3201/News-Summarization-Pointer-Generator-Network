This is the moment an abandoned dog is rescued after getting stuck down a sewer.

Video footage shows animal rescue worker Eldad Hagar climbing down into the concrete tunnel in Santa Monica, California, in the dead of night.

As he approaches the pooch it backs away in terror. Eventually Hagar manages to win the canine's trust and gently bundles him up.

Two hours later the cleaned-up puppy - nicknamed Bitty - is barely recognizable, with his straggly hair combed into soft strands.

During the rescue mission, Hagar notes that Bitty is very 'skinny' as he gets closer.

The creature is seen staring wide-eyed at the camera as he cowers behind a chair.

The film then cuts to two hours later to show Bitty being bathed and fed small pieces of food.

He enthusiastically licks up the treats. 'Itty bitty bites,' one of the rescue workers chimes.

Hagar, founder of the animal shelter Hope for Paws, uploaded the video to YouTube in a bid to highlight the cruelty cases he encounters. 

Bitty was apparently at risk of being drowned in the sewer as a storm was on its way.  

He is currently living with a foster family and is searching for a permanent home through The Forgotten Dog Foundation.
