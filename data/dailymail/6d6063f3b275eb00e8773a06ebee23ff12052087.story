Tragedy: Mark Hemmings died in agony after being continually refused an ambulance to take him to hospital

A vulnerable man died in agony from gallstones after his desperate pleas for an ambulance to hospital were refused by a 999 call handler who told him to take a warm bath instead.

Mark Hemmings died just 30 minutes after he eventually arrived at hospital - two days after he first telephoned the emergency services for help.

The 41-year-old had been struck down with painful gallstones, which could have been cured with a routine operation.

Mr Hemmings had called for an ambulance on March 29 this year and later tried spoke to an out-of-hours GP.

He was finally rushed to University Hospital of North Staffordshire on April 1 - but suffered a fatal heart attack triggered by gallstones blocking his pancreatic duct.

To add to his devastated family's distress his 60-year-old mother Sylvia passed away at the hospital on the same day.

Mr Hemmings, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, begged a 999 operator three times for an ambulance during the first seven-and-a-half minute call but was refused each time.

At one stage the dispatcher even told him to call back if he fell unconscious before dismissing his moans as stomach ache. 

Eventually the operator said: 'From what you've told me you don't need an ambulance.'

But the desperate patient replied: 'But I'm in agony.'

He was then advised to take a warm bath to ease the pain and the case was passed on to an out-of-hours GP.

Mark waited 90-minutes before the doctor called him back, and told the medic he was in agony and about to pass out in a three-and-a-half minute conversation.

But the doctor refused to come and see him, ordering Mark - who lived alone and could not drive - to get to a surgery.

When he failed to turn up for the appointment his records were marked 'did not attend' and no further checks were made on his condition.

The 41-year-old was not seen until a care worker found him writhing in agony on the floor of his home on April 1 and called 999. 

Close friend Dean Rowley, 40, who had been visiting Mark's mother in hospital on the day when mark arrived in A&E said: 'I was really close to Mark when we were boys and even though we drifted apart, I stood over his body and vowed for old times' sake to find answers to what had gone wrong as there is no-one else around to do it.

'What should have been a simple operation was never allowed to happen because he could not get an ambulance.

'His great distress and pain is clear from the calls.

'He even mentions gallstones on both calls but even that didn't bring an ambulance.

'Because he doesn't give the right answers there are catastrophic failings in the emergency system.

'He was trying to do the decent thing and answer the questions honestly - but that did not pay.

'Astonishingly no-one even asks if he is on his own or vulnerable.

'I had a real battle getting the transcripts and won't give up now to make sure no-one suffers in the same way.'

A post-mortem discovered that Mark died after his pancreatic duct was blocked by gallstones.

West Midlands Ambulance Service has defended their handling of the case, saying they followed 'national guidelines.'

A spokesman said: 'The call was assessed using national guidelines based on the information provided by the caller.

'As a result the patient's condition was judged not to be immediately life-threatening.

'To try to assist the patient, the call-handler made the necessary arrangements for an out-of-hours GP to contact the patient.

'We had no further contact until two days later when a further 999 call was received.

'On this occasion an ambulance and a rapid response vehicle were dispatched, arriving within six minutes.

'Unfortunately, despite best efforts, the man died shortly after arrival at hospital.

'The trust has carried out a full investigation which determined that the calls were handled correctly.

'As part of the process, we have organised a multi-agency meeting with senior clinicians and the family to further discuss the circumstances and establish if any lessons can be learnt.'
