A civil servant who drew a picture of what his family did on January 1 has kept it up every day since - and now has a charming pictorial diary of his young family's day-to-day life.

Instead of merely writing down what happened each day, Chris Wood, 42, accompanies each posting with jokey cartoons, many of them featuring his six-year-old son, Jack.

The pen and ink drawings include Mr Wood working out how to use his satnav, Jack losing a tooth during a visit to the cinema, family birthdays, and trips to the seaside.

Charming family record: Civil servant Chris Wood, 42, from Northwich, Cheshire, began drawing his family's day on January 1 this year, and has kept it up every day since

Happy family: Chris Wood often uses his six-year-old son, Jack, as the subject for the day's cartoons as he says such funny thing

The majority of his creations, made using pen and acrylic paint, featured Jack, riding his bike, eating his dinner or playing in the garden or going to Beavers. Other sketches show Jack on his Harry Potter style broomstick, splashing in the paddling pool and eating ice cream.

Now his sketches are set to take the internet by storm after Mr Wood, who lives with his wife, Emma, 43, and son in Northwich, Cheshire, began posting his thoughts online.

Until two years ago Mr Wood, who works in the communications department at Cheshire Police, had never had any art training and didn’t even study art at school or college.

But he said he had always drawn in his spare time and, after starting a new sketch book on January 1 when he drew a picture of what he had been doing that day, he decided to keep going, and keep an illustrated diary for the whole year.

Seven months in, he has not missed a day and said he may continue indefinitely as he has no wish to stop.

Each entry features an expertly drawn sketch of a day in the life of himself, primary school teacher wife Emma, and Jack, along with his notes on what they have been doing.

Mr Wood has had no real formal training, apart from a couple of drawing lessons he was given for his fortieth birthday two years ago, but is obviously talented

The pictures are accurate, even down to what each of them was wearing that day - Mr Wood says he often has to ask wife Emma, 43, what they were wearing

Mr Wood said: 'Drawing is something that I have always done but I never did anything with it. I never even studied art.

'A couple of years ago for my 40th birthday I was given some drawing lessons as a present, and it taught me basics that I didn’t even know about: palettes and colours.

'They said to me in those classes that I had a skill for drawing and it really encouraged me.'

Having done a few commissions and sketches for friends, Mr Wood has now set up his own company, completing cartoons, comic strips, caricatures and portraits for weddings and birthday parties.

The pictures often feature young Jack because he does and says funny things that make good cartoons his father can draw (once he's back from work, right)

Mundane parts of family life such as the car making a strange noise and childish tantrums are chronicled in Mr Wood's cartoon diary

He said: 'On January 1 we went for a walk and I decided to draw a cartoon of what we’d been up to when we got back.

'It was after that that I thought about doing one the next day and keeping it as a diary.

'The cartoons focussed on my son because often he would have said or done something funny that I could draw.

'Since I started it’s developed a real style of its own and I'm really pleased with the way it has come out - of all of the drawings I've done, there have only been a couple that I am not happy with.

'I keep them true to life so even thought they are drawn from memory, I make sure that everyone has the clothes on that they were wearing during the day.

'I often have an idea before I start but sometimes I do have to shout to Emma to remind me what I’ve been doing.

Mr Wood says he does the cartoons every night, although he once got behind by four days because the family was on holiday

The devoted father-of-one often uses Jack as his subject, whether it's an exciting birthday party or the youngster having a tantrum over his football kit

'Jack has been good to focus on because he says the funniest things. And it helps to focus on him because otherwise some days it would just be about me driving to and from work.

'Now I want to keep going and I’m determined to do the full year. It is such a nice record for us as a family and there are so many thing that I’ve drawn that I would have just forgotten about.'

Mr Wood uses moleskin sketch books for the work and has so far filled four as he completes his diary. Each is dated in the top left-hand corner and is drawn first in pencil, then pen, followed by a layer of thick brush pen before the top layer of acrylic paint is added.

Happy family: Emma and Chris Wood and their son Jack now have a treasured pictorial record of their year so far

He said his works feature simple colours and always take just half an hour to complete 'including two cups of tea'.

The father-of-one carries out his artwork in a spare room every night, although he said he once got four days behind after a holiday.

He said he is now deciding what to do with his work, which he uploads to Twitter, Tumblr and Facebook where he is building a growing fanbase.

He said: 'The work is quite personal but I am now wondering whether I should publish them. There has been a great reaction online and I enjoy the response.

'I’ve never kept a diary before but I am really starting to see why people do. I’ve really enjoyed it so far and it will be something to keep and look back on in the future.'
