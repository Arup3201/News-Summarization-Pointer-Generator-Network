A killer who strangled two fellow prisoners in order to ensure his execution used his final moments while strapped in an electric chair to tell witnesses to ‘kiss my a**’ moments before he died at 9.08pm on Wednesday.

Robert Gleason Jr.
 uttered the vulgar phrase in Irish Gaelic, according to Larry Traylor, a
 spokesman for the Virginia Department of Corrections, while adding 'Put me on the highway going to Jackson and call my Irish buddies. ... God bless,' before a leather strap was tightened over his face.

The 42-year-old was first strapped to the wooded electric chair at his chest, arms and ankles, while seen occasionally smiling, winking and nodding at his spiritual adviser who sat in the witness area, the Richmond Times Dispatch reports.

Executed: Convicted killer Robert Gleason Jr., died in an electric chair in Virginia on Wednesday night after he vowed to keep killing unless he was put to death

Farewell: This is the electric chair at the Greensville Correctional Center in Jarratt, Virginia where Robert Gleason Jr. was executed on Wednesday

That spiritual adviser, Tim 'Bam Bam' Spradling, determined it was Gleason's way of signaling that he was ready to go.

After finishing his biting last words, a wide leather strap was pulled across his eyes and mouth. A center hole allowed room for his nose.

Next a brine-soaked sea sponge - soaked to better conduct electricity throughout the body leading to a faster and less painful death - was strapped to his right calf before a second was to the top of his head.

Without the sponge the electricity administered would disperse all over the body, causing the body to cook in a far more agonizing way, as depicted in the film adaptation of Stephen King's novel, The Green Mile.

Power cables were then connected to Gleason's head and leg before a key was turned into a wall, activating the system.

With
 the last push from a button from behind a one-way window, the first 
cycle of electricity was activated, sending approximately 1,800 volts at
 7.5 amps for 30 seconds before it was decreased to 250 volts at 1.5 
amps for the next 60 seconds.

Condemned Virginia inmates can choose between lethal injection and electrocution, and Gleason is the first inmate to choose electrocution since 2010

Last stop: Gleason was executed at the pictured Greensville Correctional Center in Jarratt, Virginia at 9pm on Wednesday just moments after telling witnesses to 'kiss my a**'

sponge, left, is placed on the inmate's head to better transmit the 
electricity, though in the film, right, a guard uses a dry sponge, agonizingly cooking the man instead

After
 repeating the cycles for five minutes, allowing momentary gaps in 
between, a physician checked his heartbeat, placing a stethoscope to his
 chest but heard nothing.

He was the first executed in the U.S. this year and the first to choose to die by electrocution since 2010.

In Virginia and nine other states, inmates can choose between electrocution and lethal injection.

Robert Charles Towery (2012): 'I love my family. Potato, potato, potato.'

Towery was executed in Arizona after strangling his robbery victim Mark Jones in his Phoenix home in 1991.

Mark Stroman (2011): ‘Let’s do this damn thing’

Stroman was executed in Texas after he went on a shooting spree following the 9/11 attacks, killing three people he thought were Muslims.

Thomas J. Grasso (1995): ‘I did not get my Spaghetti-O’s, I got spaghetti. I want the press to know this’

Grasso was executed in Oklahoma for a double murder. His last meal included a can of Franco-American Spaghetti-O’s.

John Wayne Gacy (1994): ‘Kiss my ass! You’ll never find the rest’

The ‘Killer Clown’ was convicted of the rapes and murders of 33 men between 1972 and 1978.

George Appel (1928): ‘Well, gentlemen… you are about to see a baked Appel'

Moments before his execution, he also said, ‘Damn, no power outage.’ He was executed via electric chair for robbery and the murder of a New York City police officer.

Edward H. Rulloff (1870): ‘I’d like to be in hell in time for dinner’

Known as the ‘Man of Two Lives’ for his paradoxical lives of respected educator and swindler, he was hanged for the murder of his wife and daughter.

Gleason was serving life in prison without parole for a 2007 murder when he admitted to using strips from bed sheets to bind and strangle Harvey Watson, a 63-year-old inmate at Virginia's Wallens Ridge State Prison in May 2009.

According to court documents, Gleason told authorities he timed the murder to coincide with the second anniversary of the previous homicide he carried out.

He admitted to tying Watson's hands without a struggle after telling him he had come up with a way for the two to escape. Court records show he taunted Watson before he strangled him by pressing a urine-soaked sponge onto his face and a sock into his mouth.

Gleason attacked another inmate in July 2010 at the maximum-security Red Onion State Prison while he waited to be sentenced for killing Watson, according to court records.

Gleason said he asked fellow inmate 
Aaron A. Cooper, 26, to try on a 'religious necklace,' which Gleason 
threaded through a wire fence separating the two while they were in 
solitary recreation pens.

Gleason testified that he mercilessly choked 
Cooper through the fence 'till he turned purple,' waited for his skin 
color to return to normal, then choked him to death.

According to a security camera that filmed the horrific incident, Cooper was left unwatched by guards for roughly 75 minutes after placed inside his cell.

Cooper's mother has sued the Virginia
 prison system, accusing prison authorities of giving Gleason the 
opportunity to murder her son after Gleason told guards he planned to 
kill again.

After reaffirming that vow, Gleason explained the situation as
 being that it's not because he wants to die, but rather because he 
knows he will kill again if he's not executed.

He wanted to be put 
to death despite attempts by his former court-appointed attorneys to 
halt the execution at the Greensville Correctional Center and have him undergo a mental competency evaluation.

The attorneys had argued the time he 
spent in solitary confinement on death row left him unable to make 
rational decisions, a claim authorities rejected.

During court proceedings, Gleason 
indicated he intended to keep killing unless he was given the death 
penalty, according to the state Attorney General's Office. Gleason told a
 federal judge earlier this month he did not want a lawyer and called 
for his execution to proceed.

His former lawyers said Gleason 
suffered from mental illness and had made several suicide attempts. 
Their final effort to halt the execution to allow for an evaluation of 
his mental competency was rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court on 
Wednesday.

Third victim: Aaron Cooper, a carjacker with gang ties who's seen left in 2001, was strangled to death in 2010 by Gleason using this white noose, right, that was slipped through a wire fence

Murder: Gleason strangled Cooper at the Red Onion State Prison, pictured, before video surveillance revealed Cooper was left unchecked in a pen next to Gleason for approximately 75 minutes

He told The Associated Press he deserved to die for what he did.

'Why
 prolong it? The end result's gonna be the same,' Gleason said from 
death row in his thick Boston accent in one of numerous interviews he's 
given to The Associated Press over three years.

'The death part don't bother me. This has been a long time coming. It's called karma.'

Gleason
 claimed he's killed others – perhaps dozens more – but he has refused 
to provide details. He claims he's different from the other men on 
Virginia's death row for one important reason: he only kills criminals.

Watson was serving life for killing one man and injuring two others. Cooper was a carjacker with gang ties.

'I ain't saying I'm a better person 
for killing criminals, but I've never killed innocent people,' Gleason 
said.

'I killed people that's in the same lifestyle as me, and they 
know, hey, these things can happen.'

Gleason said he only requested death in order to keep a promise to a loved one that he wouldn't kill again.

He
 said doing so will allow him to teach his children, including two young
 sons, what can happen if they follow in his footsteps.

'I wasn't there as a father and I'm hoping that I can do one last good thing,' he said. 'Hopefully, this is a good thing.'

On Wednesday he reportedly had a last meal, but chose not to release the details of the dish publicly.

Old Sparky: Auburn Correctional Facility's original electric chair is seen

The electric chair was the brainchild of an 1881 New York state 
committee charged with finding a more humane method of execution to 
replace hanging.

The first inmate to be put to death in one was William 
Kemmler in 1890 in New York's Auburn Prison.

It took two attempts 
running current through Kemmler to finally kill him, and witnesses 
described the horrific spectacle as 'far worse than hanging.'

After some
 refining, the chair became the most popular method of execution from 
the early 1900s until the 1980s when it was overtaken by lethal 
injection.

The last use of the chair was in March 2010, when Virginia 
inmate and convicted murderer and rapist Paul Warner Powell chose it 
over lethal injection.
