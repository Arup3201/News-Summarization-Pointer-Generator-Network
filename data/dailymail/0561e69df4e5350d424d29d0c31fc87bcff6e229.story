This is one family where they don’t Call The Midwife – they call their mother.

In what is best described as a labour of love, Jude Beard has delivered six of her own grandchildren.

She also acted as the birthing partner for the other two when they were born by Caesarean section.

Family ties: From left, Billy Herbert, 2, with mum Lisa Herbert, 28, Charlie Herbert, 4, Emily Herbert, 8, Amy Webber, 28, holding son Alex Hancock, 4, Jac Herbert, 10, Max Hancock, 5, Jude Beard, 49, holding Annie Owen, 4 mnths, Oliver Moir, 7 (Leigh Webber's son), and Leigh Webber, 30

The 49-year-old qualified as a nurse in 2002 and became a midwife two years later. A coincidence of timing (plus a little gentle badgering of her bosses at the hospital where she works) allowed her to take charge of the deliveries.

It is probably fair to say opinion among those about to give birth is divided between women who would love their mother to be present, and those who could think of nothing worse.

But yesterday Jude surrounded herself with her family and declared: ‘The girls would have wanted me to be with them anyway, but this was much more special.

‘It’s important that an expectant mother has trust in their midwife, and it’s always easier if they have their mum with them too.

'I’ve been very lucky to be able to combine the two – on six occasions.’

The rewarding role of the midwife has been highlighted lately with the BBC1’s Call The Midwife drama, starring Miranda Hart.

Jude’s twin daughters Amy Webber and Lisa Herbert, 28, are the proud mothers of the six children she delivered.

Lisa was first to call on mum’s expertise to deliver Emily, the second of her four children.

2002: Jude Beard qualified as a nurse and assists during Caesarean section delivery of Jac Herbert, eldest son (now 10) of daughter of Lisa Herbert

October 2004: Jude qualifies as a midwife and, on the same day, delivers her granddaughter Emily, the now eight-year-old daughter of Lisa

2005: Oliver Moir, now seven, is born to Leigh Webber by Caesarean section and Jude assists

2007: Jude delivers Max Hancock, now five, eldest son of Amy Webber

2008: Just seven weeks apart, Jude delivers Alex Hancock, now four, son of Amy, and Charlie Herbert, son of Lisa

2010: Jude delivers Billy Herbert, youngest son of Lisa

2012: Jude delivers her newest grandchild, Annie Owen, daughter of Amy

Mum-of-three Jude said: 'Births don't always go according to plan, but fortunately they were all nice, normal deliveries'

Her first child Jac, now ten, was born after an emergency Caesarean as complications threatened them both.

She was not expected to have her second child naturally – but Jude got the call to say she was in labour as she headed off to her first day at work at University Hospital of Wales, near the family home outside Cardiff.

Jude said: ‘I rushed to be with her as a mum but she asked my supervisor if I could be her midwife. My boss said I could, so I did. My beautiful granddaughter was born without any complications.’

She added: ‘Births don’t always go according to plan, but fortunately they were all nice, normal deliveries. I was over the moon when I held Emily for the first time.’

When Amy became pregnant a couple of years later she also asked for her mum. Maternity staff gave her the go-ahead to help at the birth of grandson Max, now five.

Jude has since gone on to deliver Lisa’s sons Charlie, four, and Billy, two, plus Amy’s son Alex, four, and baby daughter Annie – the newest addition to the close-knit family.

The only other grandchild she has not helped deliver is Oliver, the seven-year-old son of her eldest daughter Leigh Webber, 30.

He was a Caesarean birth but Jude was on hand as a birthing partner.

Amy said: ‘We’re all really close – we’ve always been more like sisters than mother and daughters.’

However, the arrival of baby Annie, now four months old, looks set to signal the end of Jude’s midwifery services.

Her three daughters are not planning on having any more children so they can focus on their careers.

New baby: Amy Webber and partner Rob Owen holding baby Annie just after she was born in 2012
