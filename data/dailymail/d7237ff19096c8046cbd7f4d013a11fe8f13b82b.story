The lorry was parked in the garden city, when police were alerted at around 1pm on Thursday. The driver had stopped in East London some time before.

Hertfordshire Police are appealing for witnesses and information following the seizure of what they describe as significant amount of class A drugs.

Detective Superintendent Peter Fulham said: 'A significant quantity of drugs has been removed from criminal circulation and I have a team of officers investigating who is responsible for their importation and intended distribution.

'Hertfordshire Constabulary, working with the National Crime Agency, will relentlessly pursue and arrest those involved in the supply of a class A drug that causes such harm.
