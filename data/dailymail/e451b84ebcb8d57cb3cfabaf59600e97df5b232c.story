So where does Bradford City’s shock 4-2 victory at Premier League leaders Chelsea rank in the history of FA Cup upsets?

There is one man better placed than most to tell us.

Here, Match of the Day’s John Motson – who has commentated on the competition since 1972 – runs Sportsmail though his 10 greatest FA Cup giant-killing acts...

10. York 1 Arsenal 0, Fourth Round, 1985

There was snow on the pitch but York fancied their chances because manager Denis Smith got a load of volunteers in on the morning of the game to clear it. It was goalless with five minutes left when York got a penalty and Keith Houchen put it away. He then disappeared for a couple of years before popping up and scoring for Coventry in the 87 Final.

9. Bournemouth 2 Manchester United 0, Third Round, 1984

Ron Atkinson’s United were holders but they got turned over good and proper by Third Division Bournemouth, whose manager was a young Harry Redknapp. United even had England captain Bryan Robson in their side, but Redknapp’s team were deserved winners and scored twice in five minutes after half-time through Milton Graham and Ian Thompson.

8. Walsall 2 Arsenal 0, Third Round, 1933

Herbert Chapman’s team were the outstanding side in the country and this is the greatest pre-war FA Cup upset. Arsenal were so humiliated by Third Division Walsall that, on the train home, Chapman sacked the defender who gave away one of the goals.

7. Wrexham 2 Arsenal 1, Third Round, 1992

Arsenal were First Division champions at the time and this game had everything, brilliant goals, disallowed goals and drama until the last. Micky Thomas scored that belter of a free-kick into the top corner to equalise before Steve Watkin got the winner two minutes from the end – but there was still time for Arsenal to have a goal ruled out.

6. Burnley 0 Wimbledon 1, Third Round, 1975

This was the first time in 55 years that a non-league team beat a First Division side on their own ground. Dave Bassett played for Wimbledon and Dickie Guy – who is club president to this day – was in goal.

5. Sunderland 1 Leeds 0, Final, 1973

I was at the Leeds hotel on the morning of the game and they were awfully tense. Sunderland, on the other hand, were relaxed and laughing and joking. They were a Second Division side and no-one gave them a chance. But they gave Don Revie’s superstars a helluva game and, although Ian Porterfield got the goal, it’s Jim Montgomery’s double save which stands out in my memory.

4. Yeovil 2 Sunderland 1, Fourth Round, 1949

Sunderland weren’t just a First Division side, they were known as the “Bank of England Club” of that era for the huge sums of money they’d spent on the team. Yeovil, meanwhile, were in the Southern League. Player-manager Alec Stock was a real character, he scored for Yeovil and he went on to manage Fulham in the 1975 Cup Final.

3. Chelsea 2 Bradford 4, Fourth Round, 2015

Now this would have still been a shock if Bradford had won at Valley Parade – but factor in Chelsea leading 2-0 at Stamford Bridge and it is quite remarkable. Jose Mourinho had never lost an FA cup match at home and, for me, this ranks as one of the greatest upsets of all time.

2. Sutton 2 Coventry 1, Third Round, 1989

I did this game and I remember Sutton had been practising corners all morning and hadn’t scored from one – then Tony Rains puts them ahead from a corner and Matthew Hanlan scores the winner from a corner. Their manager, Barrie Williams, was a character, a pipe-smoking and poetry-quoting old-school boss. And Coventry, don’t forget, had won the cup just 19 months earlier.

1. Hereford 2 Newcastle 1, Third Round, 1972

People forget that non-league Hereford had already drawn 2-2 at Newcastle to earn a replay. Ronnie Radford scored his famous rocket and that has to be the most replayed goal in the history of the competition. I was there and this game is everything which is brilliant about the FA Cup, the pitch was a bog and Newcastle’s superstars such as Malcolm Macdonald had been spouting off in the press, but they got their comeuppance alright.
