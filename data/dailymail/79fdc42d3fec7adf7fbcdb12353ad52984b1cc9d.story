Astronomers have released the first pictures of what they think what a black hole will look like - but admit they don't yet have to technology to check their theory.

Black holes are invisible, as not even light can escape their gravitational pull.

But it is believed that the boundaries around themÂ  - a point of no return called the event horizon - should be visible from the radiation emitted by matter as it is sucked in.

Crescent shape: Astronomers from Berkeley have created this prediction of what a black hole looks like based on observations of Sagittarius A*, the black hole at the centre of our galaxy

It is that expectation that led Ayman Bin Kamruddin of the University of California, Berkeley to present this image of what a black hole picture could look like at the 221st meeting of the American Astronomical Society.

As the picture shows, it is expected that the first black hole pictures - which will in fact show the boundaries around them - will take a crescent form, rather than the blobby shape they are popularly given.

'A black hole's immediate surroundings have a lot of really interesting physics going on, and they emit light,' Mr Kamruddin told LiveScience.

'Technically speaking, we aren't exactly seeing the black hole, but we are effectively resolving the event horizon.'

Mr Kamruddin's picture is not just an exercise in astronomical speculation. It is based on a model that astronomers are using to to prepare to interpret the images that will become available from apparatus under construction.

A new project called the Event Horizon Telescope will combine observations from a worldwide network of radio telescopes to get data on objects in space that would otherwise be too tiny to see.

'The Event Horizon Telescope is the first to resolve spatial scales comparable to the size of the event horizon of a black hole,' said Berkeley astronomer Jason Dexter, who collaborated with Mr Kamruddin on the image.

'I don't think it's crazy to think we might get an image in the next five years.'

This is NOT what a black hole looks like: A previous artists' impression of a black hole

A black hole is a region of spacetime from which gravity prevents anything, including light, from escaping.

The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass will deform spacetime to form a black hole.

Around a black hole there is a mathematically defined surface called an event horizon that marks the point of no return.

It is called 'black' because it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon, reflecting nothing, just like a perfect black body in thermodynamics.

Despite its invisible interior, the presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other matter and with electromagnetic radiation such as light.

The new telescope has already gathered preliminary measurements of the black hole at the centre of our own Milky Way galaxy, known as Sagittarius A*.

The researchers matched this data to various models and found that they best fit crescent-shaped images rather than the 'asymmetric Gaussian' blob shape previously used in models.

This crescent shape reflects that doughnut-shaped disk of matter which orbits a black hole as it is inexorably sucked inside.

As gas spins around the black hole, the side which points towards observers on Earth will appear brighter as a result of a process called Doppler beaming, while the other side will appear dimmer.

The centre of the crescent is a dark circle which represents the black hole itself.

Ultimately the researchers hope to use the first pictures of Sagittarius A* to weigh the black hole at the centre of our galaxy.

They also hope to prove certain aspects of the theory of general relativity that have thus far escaped confirmation.

Nevertheless, Mr Kamruddin said just getting an image at all will be 'mind-blowing'.

He told LiveScience: 'It will provide direct confirmation of the event horizon, which has been predicted, but no one's ever actually seen it. Seeing what it is like will rule out certain physics.'
