Former Alaska senator Mike Gravel is running a weed business.

The 84-year-old, who served in the Senate from 1969 to 1981 before running for president in 2008, has become the new head of KUSH, which develops innovative cannabis-based products.

One of his first ventures will be to launch the 'Kubby': a cannabis lozenge.

Venture: Mike Gravel, 84, plans to launch a cannabis as the new head of innovative weed firm KUSH

'I’m anxious to assist in bringing this important resource to a broader market in a serious and credible way,' Gravel said in a statement.

It is the latest in a political lifetime of controversial moves for Gravel, a staunch opponent of the Vietnam War and drug law reformist.

An entire chapter of his book Citizen Power slams the 'war on drugs' that started with President Nixon.

His appointment comes after years as 'an aggressive board member' at Cannabis Sativa Inc, Gravel told Alaska Dispatch News.

With bases in Washington and Colorado - where marijuana use is legal - the firm plans to venture into Alaska in the near future after a ballot measure legalized recreational use in November.

Steve Kubby, chairman of Cannabis Sativa Inc - and namesake of the new lozenge - said in a statement: 'Senator Gravel stood up to Nixon, stood up to the Pentagon, and now he is standing up to those in power who would keep the healthful benefits of cannabis from those who need them.

'He’s been a director of KUSH since its inception and brings invaluable perspective and connections to our group.

'He’s a true American hero and we’re excited to have him serving in this capacity.'

Kubby added that Gravel has personally benefitted from medicinal use of cannabis.
