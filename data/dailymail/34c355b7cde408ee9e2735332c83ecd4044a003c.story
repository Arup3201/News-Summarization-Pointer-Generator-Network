An American Airlines plane was forced into an emergency landing at Heathrow Airport this morning after the windscreen cracked mid-flight.

Flight AA65 was around 45 minutes into its journey from Zurich in Switzerland to New York, US, when pilots declared an emergency, and landed at Heathrow at 11.30am local time.

The passengers departed the Boeing 767-300, and ground staff are expected to try and replace the windscreen.

There is a chance the passengers will have to be placed on other flights to continue their journey on to the US.

A spokesperson for American Airlines told MailOnline Travel: 'We can confirm that the American Airlines AA65 landed safely at Heathrow after an emergency was declared due to a cracked windscreen.

'We don't know exactly how many passengers were on board, but it was a fairly light load at what is a quiet time of the year.'

It is hoped after refuelling and a replacement windscreen, the plane will take to the skies around 1.30pm.

The rapid descent of the plane caused worry to some users of social networks

Many believed judging by the flight path and descent, that the plane would land at Gatwick and not Heathrow

Users on Twitter were keeping up to date with the plane's movements as it soared over the UK.

Many believed the American Airlines jet would be landing at Gatwick, but instead it continued on to Heathrow where officials at the airport confirmed it landed 'safely'.

One user, who was believed to be following the descent on a flight tracker, described the plane as 'flying like a madman.'
