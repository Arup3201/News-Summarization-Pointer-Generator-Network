A public school housemaster who seduced a vulnerable 16-year-old pupil and became so infatuated that he bought her an ‘engagement ring’ was jailed yesterday.

Married Mark Westcott, 48, would take the girl for drives following evening ‘prep’ after they began an affair during a school ski trip.

The design and technology teacher, who was the girl’s housemaster, engaged in sexual acts with her inside a school room, in his car and at a Travelodge hotel.

Jailed: Married Mark Westcott had sex with one of his female students in a classroom. He began the affair with the teenager when she was just 16

He first targeted her by sending 
explicit text messages and pictures of himself naked after she turned to
him for pastoral support.

His victim, now 17, who cannot be 
named for legal reasons, later told police he had bought her a ring and 
began referring to her as ‘Mrs Westcott’.

Westcott, a father who had taught at 
the school in the Bath area of Somerset for 20 years, was jailed for 16 
months and told that he would never be able to work with children again.

He had pleaded guilty to three counts of sexual activity with a child while in a position of trust.

Judge Douglas Field said the 
teacher’s life was ‘in ruins’. Westcott has lost his job and is 
separated from his wife Deborah, who was in court yesterday.

The victim’s mother spoke of ‘being taken in’ by Westcott in extracts from a letter read to Swindon Crown Court.

It read: ‘As a family I feel we have 
all been taken in by him. We absolutely trusted him and thought he 
provided pastoral support during her difficult times. We never thought 
he would cross his professional boundaries.’

Breach of trust: The affair began when the girl was aged 16 and taking her GCSEs in Year 11 at a school in the Bath area

The court heard the two first began 
sending each other text messages after swapping numbers when she was in 
Year 11,  and had approached him for pastoral support.

The pair then began exchanging explicit text messages – swapping naked pictures of themselves while he was on holiday in France.

But the relationship turned physical 
on a skiing trip early this year and police began to investigate after a
tip-off from a fellow pupil at the school.

Westcott’s victim initially refused 
to co-operate, but later confessed to the consensual affair after 
officers discovered emails between them detailing their activities.

Prosecutor Siobhan Linsley told the 
court: ‘The text messages became less innocent over time and by  the 
summer of this year the pair were sneaking around at school and began 
meeting up.’

They had first met for sex when Westcott booked a room for them both at a Travelodge hotel in August this year.

The court also heard that the pupil 
had performed a sex act on the teacher after they went for an evening 
drive in his car after ‘prep’ class in October.

Mrs Linsley added: ‘In September he 
gave her a ring that  she considered to be an engagement ring and he 
called her Mrs Westcott.’

However in the autumn the relationship began to cool as the girl began seeing someone else.

‘She had a boyfriend near her own age
and that shocked the defendant,’ Mrs Linsley said, adding that they had
been arguing because he ‘could not bear her being with someone else’.

Judge Field told Westcott, from North
Wraxall, Wiltshire: ‘You formed an entirely inappropriate relationship 
with a pupil of yours who was 16 and became 17.

‘This was a very serious breach of trust. She was a pupil and  you were her teacher  and housemaster.

‘You were responsible for her pastoral care.

‘In breach of that this relationship developed into an extensive sexual relationship. This is a very, very, serious case.’

He added: ‘You are a man who, until the early months of  this year, had an impeccable character.

‘It is amazing to everyone, including
me, that at the age of 48 you behave in this entirely inappropriate 
way. Your life is in ruins.

‘The fact is that girls like this need protection. She was vulnerable.’

Charles Row, defending, said calling the pupil ‘Mrs Westcott’ had been a joke.

Mr Row told the court that Westcott ‘is ashamed for his failure of resolve, self-control and will’.

He added: ‘He has lost his reputation, his family, his home, his career, his livelihood and his pension’.
