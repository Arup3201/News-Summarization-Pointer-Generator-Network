A Seattle father has been reunited with his baby daughter after the little girl was kidnapped during a car theft on Thursday.

The father, who has not been named, left his black SUV running and his daughter in her car seat around 3.15 pm as he ran into a West Seattle convenience store near 16th Ave. SW and SW Holden Street.

A young man who had been loitering around the store for most of the day then jumped in the car, backed up and drove off, just as the father came out of the shop.

Surveilance footage taken from inside the store captured the moment the man chased after his car, with witnesses telling KOMO News he was screaming: 'My baby, my baby!'

Brazen: All of a sudden a young man who had been hanging around the store comes up to the car and prepares to get in

Shocked: The father walks out just as the thief is getting into his car

Chase: As the thief backs up, the father goes after him

Running: The father tried his bet to stop the thief but he takes off

Witnesses say the man was screaming 'my baby!' as the SUV took off down the street

The man ran to a fire house across the street for help.

Some 19 minutes later, police in a helicopter saw the SUV abandoned in the middle of a street one mile from the convenience store.

It appears the thief fled the vehicle upon realizing their was child onboard.

One witness, Carlisia Minnis, noticed the car stranded on the road and through the windows saw there was a car seat.

'If I couldn't get in I was going to break a window because all I thought about was the baby,' she told CNN.

The little girl was not harmed and was released into the care of her father.

Both were taken from the scene in a police car.
