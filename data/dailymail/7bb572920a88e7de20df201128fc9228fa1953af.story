Woolwich murder suspect Michael Adebolajo was approached by MI5 six months ago and asked if he would work for the security service, it was claimed last night.

A childhood friend of the suspected terrorist claimed MI5 started following Adebolajo after a trip to Kenya last year.

Abu Nusaybah said the murder suspect believed MI5 was bugging him and 'knocking on his door'  asking for information on 'certain individuals'.

MI5 is already facing criticism after it emerged Adebolajo and fellow suspect Michael Adebowale had been monitored by the security service for eight years.

It is facing an inquiry by MPs amid a raft of 
devastating revelations about the alleged killers’ known links to Islamist 
extremism.

Mr Nusaybah, speaking on the BBC's Newsnight programme last night about Abebolajo's MI5 claims, said : 'His wording was, "They are bugging me - they won't leave me alone."

'He mentioned initially they wanted to ask him if he knew certain individuals.

'But
 after him saying that he didn't know these individuals, what he said 
was they asked him if he would be interested in working for them.

'He was explicit in that he refused to work for them but he did confirm he didn't know the individuals.'

Nusaybah also said he 
thought Adebolajo had undergone a 'change' following his detention by 
security forces on the trip.

He said Adebolajo suggested he had been 
physically and sexually abused while he was interrogated in the African 
country, and after this he became withdrawn and 'less talkative - he 
wasn't his usual bubbly self.

Following the interview Nusaybah himself was arrested at the BBC in relation to terrorism offences.

The Metropolitan Police said a 
31-year-old man was arrested in relation to terrorism offences and 
search warrants were executed at two addresses in east London.

Career: Drummer Rigby, 25, known as 'Riggers', was known as a brave soldier

He
 was held on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of 
acts of terrorism and is being held in custody at a south London police 
station.

The arrest was not directly linked to Drummer Rigby's death, the Met said.

It emerged earlier this week that 
Adebolajo was so high profile he was photographed outside Paddington 
Green police station six years ago behind notorious hate preacher Anjem 
Choudary.

He was even intercepted by officials as he attempted to travel to Somalia to fight alongside Islamist terrorists last year.

It also emerged that Adebolajo was a violent ex-prisoner who was a member of a banned terrorist group.

Incredibly, he was said to have been 
preaching jihad on the streets of Woolwich earlier this week, only a few
 hundred yards from where 25-year-old Army Drummer Lee Rigby – a married
 father – was beheaded.

As MI5 faced accusations that they 
let the men slip through the net, David Cameron ordered a full 
intelligence review by a Westminster committee.

It was also claimed yesterday that Michael Adebowale became radicalised after trying to escape gangland ‘trouble’.

London-born Adebowale was told to ‘disappear’ after he was caught up with a local gang known as the Woolwich Boys, and underwent a dramatic change of personality.

Once a fun-loving schoolboy who was described as ‘always smiling’ and chatted to neighbours about Jamie Oliver recipes, he began dressing in traditional Islamic dress and preaching a radical message of hate.

Adebowale gave up alcohol and began distributing radical leaflets near his mother’s home in Greenwich, south-east London.

Neighbours
 said his Nigerian-born mother, Juliet Obasuyi, was a probation officer 
and a ‘hard-working’ Christian woman who raised Adebowale alone after 
separating from his father.

Police raided her flat and a property linked to Adebowale’s father, Adeniyi Adebowale, in Holloway, North London.

Plain-clothes officers were seen carrying six plastic bags full of video cassettes and audio tapes from the Holloway flat.

Shock: A friend of Adebowale, 22, who has known him from the age of 11, said today that he converted to Islam when he was aged around 19 

The
 videos appeared to be labelled as football matches but one line of 
inquiry for police is likely to be whether Adebowale was interested in 
the type of jihadi videos watched by the July 2005 London bombers.

The four bombers were linked to an 
extreme bookshop in Leeds which distributed videos of terrorist acts, 
exhorting followers to emulate them.

Michael Oluwatobi Adebowale was born 
to Nigerian parents in Denmark Hill, South London, in May 1991. His 
father was then a student at Rutherford College in Canterbury, Kent, and
 the couple were said to have separated soon after the birth.

Adebowale
 attended Kidbrooke School in Greenwich, where former pupils said he was
 known as Toby or Tobi, an abbreviation of his second name Oluwatobi.

Luqman Ciise said on Twitter: ‘I knew him personally, he was normal, smiling all the time. His name was Toby. Still can’t believe this . . . How did he get radicalised?’

Adebowale was said to have converted to Islam at 19, while studying at Greenwich University, where he met the other Woolwich suspect, Michael Adebolajo.

Family friend Madeleine Edwards, 49, said Adebowale had been in ‘some serious gangland trouble’ in 2010 and that his mother had told her he ‘had to disappear for a while’.

She said Adebowale’s father was a ‘typical African gentleman’ but his mother had struggled to control her wayward son.

Adebowale was said to have left the 
Greenwich area for a year and returned about eight months ago, wearing 
traditional Islamic garb and a white skull cap, typically worn by Muslim
 men who have been on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca.

A
 neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Michael would always say 
hello and play with my children, but in the last year he stopped. He 
would just ignore us when we saw him at the lift.

‘He used to talk to me very enthusiastically about cooking and his recipes. He loved Jamie Oliver and had his books.

Detectives guard the fourth floor flat, which neighbours said they often heard Muslim songs from and confirm that they saw both the suspects there

‘But more recently, he would just put
 his head down when he saw me. Even if I tried to talk to him he was 
very dismissive. I thought it was weird.

‘It was odd as his mother was a devout Christian. And it seemed like such a sudden change.’

In recent months Adebowale had begun 
seeing a woman who had converted to Islam two years ago and wore a 
headscarf to cover her hair.

Armed police raided her flat, also in Greenwich, and led away two women and a 15-year-old boy, who witnesses said was handcuffed.

Two toddlers and a baby were also said to have been taken from the property.

Neighbours described hearing regular prayers and chanting from the flat.

A friend who has known Adebowale since he was 11 spoke of his shock at seeing the video of the Woolwich atrocity.

The man, who asked to remain anonymous, told ITV’s Daybreak: ‘That wasn’t the same person.

‘He wasn’t someone monstrous, that was not the same person.

‘He
 converted to Islam, preaching Islam, preaching peace. Not preaching 
anything bad or anything negative. Just literally the ways of Islam.

‘I would see him going to mosque and coming back from mosque.

‘He was completely normal . . . He was one of us at school. Nothing evil about him at all.’
