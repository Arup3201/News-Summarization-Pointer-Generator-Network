A northern white rhinoceros that was just one of six left in the world has died at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park.

Angalifu, who was about 44 years old, apparently died of old age on Sunday. He had arrived at the park from the Khartoum Zoo in Sudan in August 1990.

'Angalifu's death is a tremendous loss to all of us,' safari park curator Randy Rieches said in a statement. 'Not only because he was well beloved here at the park but also because his death brings this wonderful species one step closer to extinction.'

On their Facebook page, zoo officials said the rhino had been 'under veterinary care for geriatric conditions for some time'.

His death leaves only one northern white rhino at the zoo - a 40-year-old female named Nola - another at a zoo in the Czech Republic and three in a preserve in Kenya. Of these, just one is male.

Angalifu's death also comes after the death of another white rhino earlier in 2014.

Rhino horns are valued as dagger handles and the powdered form is mistakenly seen as an aphrodisiac. As a result, poaching has pushed the critically endangered rhinos to the brink of extinction.

Attempts to mate Angalifu with Nola weren't successful.

Just last week, preservationists at the Old Pejeta animal sanctuary in Kenya conceded that their one male and two female northern white rhinos will not reproduce naturally.

The northern white rhino is one of the two subspecies of white rhino (the other is the southern white rhino). They were originally found across grasslands and woodlands in East and Central Africa, but now there are just five remaining. All are in captivity - one in San Diego, one in the Czech Republic and three at a preserve in Kenya.

Poaching through the 1970s and 1980s saw numbers dwindle. In the early 2000s, it was believed just five to 10 remained in the wild.

Rhino horns are valued as dagger handles and are mistakenly seen as an aphrodisiac in their powdered form.

And it's not just the northern rhino under threat. A rise in poaching has been encouraged by a thriving market in Vietnam and China for rhino horn, which is used  as a traditional medicine believed to cure ailments and diseases, including cancer.

Southern white rhinos almost went extinct at the end of the 19th century, plunging down to only 20 at one point. Decades of conservation efforts gradually brought them back to life.

According to the WWF, there are more than 20,000 southern white rhinos alive today.

The animals were flown from the Czech zoo to the Kenyan conservancy in December 2009 in hopes the natural environment could be easier for them to breed there than in captivity.

'We always knew from the very beginning that the chances of this working were small even if they bred,' said Richard Vigne, chief executive of the conservancy. 

Efforts will now be made to keep the species alive through in vitro fertilization. That experiment could take place with a southern white rhino surrogate mother.

Angalifu's semen and testicular tissue have been stored at the San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research and will be used with the rhinos in Kenya when new reproductive technologies are developed.

'More than two decades ago we started working with the species here at the Safari Park,' Barbara Durrant of the San Diego Zoo Institute of Conservation Research said in a statement.

'Unfortunately we only had three rhinos here at the park and they were all of an advanced age. We were not able to get them to breed and we have been sadly watching their species being exterminated in the wild.'

Efforts to reproduce the rhinos naturally have long been unsuccessful and efforts will now be made to keep the species alive through IVF

The animals are poached for their horns, which are mistakenly seen as an aphrodisiac, and they have seen their numbers plunge since the 1970s
