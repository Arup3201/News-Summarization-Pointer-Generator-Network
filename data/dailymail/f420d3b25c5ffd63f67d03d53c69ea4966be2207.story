Court case: A female soldier, known only as AB, is suing the Ministry of Defence for their handling of her sexual assault claims (file photo)

A sailor is taking the Ministry of Defence to court after she was sexually assaulted by a British soldier in Afghanistan while they both stood guard over a terrorist.

The woman, who is in her 20s, had her breasts fondled and was subjected to lewd demands for sex during the 12-hour ordeal, which left her ‘disgusted and terrified’.

The incident happened after she was posted to Camp Bastion to watch over Zia Rahman, a rogue Afghan policeman who turned his gun on three British soldiers, killing them in July 2012.

Last night, the woman, an Able Seaman who can be identified only as AB, revealed how Corporal Christopher Yard made unwanted sexual advances towards her as they stood guard in the compound’s hospital, where the injured Taliban terrorist had been taken.

She said: ‘He groped my breast and I slapped his hand away. He said he could not help himself. He said he had cheated on his previous girlfriend and had a high sex drive, needing to have sex three to four times a day.

‘He also suggested we went on a midnight run together and have sex in a military container. I felt trapped because I could not leave my post.’

She added: ‘In a war zone and while we were guarding a significant terrorist, he fondled my breasts.

'To be sexually harassed and felt up by a more senior member of British Forces, while guarding a notorious suspect, was shocking and traumatic.’

She is bringing a compensation claim for sexual harassment and sex discrimination at an employment tribunal in Exeter. The MoD is defending the case, saying she did not properly comply with the military complaints procedure before issuing her claim.

Under military rules, service personnel can bring a compensation claim only after they have exhausted the internal grievance process.

Ms AB’s original complaint led to Yard being tried by a court martial for sexual assault. Although he pleaded not guilty, he was convicted and sentenced in June last year to 120 days’ detention and demoted two ranks to Trooper.

At an appeal hearing last August his sentence was reduced to  30 days’ detention and demotion by one rank to Lance Corporal.

But Ms AB, who returned to Britain at the end of her posting in August 2012, claims she was not properly  supported after the assault, which left her feeling ‘very vulnerable’.

In a statement submitted to an employment tribunal, she said: ‘The next day, I reported the sexual assault to my superior. But Cpl Yard was not moved from his station so I was very afraid to have to work in relatively close proximity to him.’

She added: ‘They prosecuted him, but forgot about me. I never felt listened to. They still see staff who complain about the conduct of an officer as being the problem unless you accept their outcome.

'They do not have a victim-centred approach.’

Her lawyers say the legal action is a test case that will reveal how the  military has closed ranks on sexual harassment by denying complainants the right to take their cases to civil courts.

Her solicitor, Lawrence Davies, of Equal Justice, said he believes there are ‘dozens’ of other cases that have been suppressed through MoD internal grievance rules.

An MoD report in 2012 found all  of the 400 female soldiers questioned claimed to have experienced ‘unwanted sexual attention’.

An MoD spokesman said: ‘While we cannot comment on individual or ongoing cases, the Armed Forces have a zero tolerance approach to all forms of bullying, discrimination and abuse.’
