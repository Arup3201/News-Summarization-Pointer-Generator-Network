Rebecca Reeves, 34, was the head of a group of five women who targeted the elderly in the Lancashire town of Chorley

A girl gang nicknamed 'Chorley's Angels' charmed frail old men before exploiting them for cash.

Security cameras captured one of the gang – whose name comes from the town where they carried out their crimes – flirting with her elderly victim and planting a kiss on his cheek after bluffing her way into his home.

The five-strong group carried out reconnaissance activities around their Lancashire town, looking for vulnerable targets.

They then posed as carers or offered to help the men with weekly shopping trips in order to win their trust – before asking for or simply stealing their money.

At least 40 victims in their 70s and 80s handed over cash, but police fear there are many other elderly men who were targeted but are too embarrassed to come forward.

Yesterday the leader of the gang, Rebecca Reeves, 34, was behind bars, sentenced to three years and eight months after admitting burglary and theft.

She was also issued with a five-year criminal antisocial behaviour order banning her from offering services and sexual favours for money and from entering any sheltered or supported housing on her release.

Her sister Emma, 36, and fellow gang members Tracy Halliday, 40, Lesley Bennett, 36, and Andrena Kelly, 36, have all been served with Asbos ordering them to stay away from potential victims.

After a previous hearing, the son of one of the victims said: 'I am so angry with these women. They're just horrible people.

'Your natural human instinct is to look after vulnerable old people, yet these women pretended to care when they didn't.'

Many of the gang's victims were men with physical disabilities or dementia who lived alone, Preston Crown Court was told.

On one occasion, Rebecca Reeves broke into a house belonging to a frail and infirm 57-year-old. He often left the door unlocked to allow his carers to get in, but in June last year the man said he heard a noise and propelled himself in his wheelchair to investigate.

He found the front door open and 50 
cigarettes and £85 in cash missing from his bedroom. Reeves was seen 
leaving the property and was later spotted at a nearby shop.

While on 
bail, Reeves and Halliday went to the home of a 74-year-old man who they
 visited regularly to try to get money by offering services such as 
shopping, household chores and sexual favours.

But after they had left the house, he discovered £15 had been taken.

Halliday,
 who admitted theft, was jailed for four months having been giving an 
Asbo at an earlier hearing. The other three women were issued with the 
Asbos in January.

Passing 
sentence, Judge Robert Altham said: 'There is no way of qualifying the 
amount of money that was taken, but the fact is that the two of you took
 advantage of an elderly man by distracting him.'

Afterwards
 Inspector David Robinson of Lancashire Police said: 'Reeves targeted 
some of the most vulnerable members of our community.'

He
 said the gang had been operating for years and that the victims police 
know about 'are potentially only the tip of the iceberg'.tentially only 
the tip of the iceberg'.
