Separating your delicates from your everyday clothes, and having to wash them at different times could soon be a thing of the past.

LG has unveiled a washing machine with two washers that lets people save time and energy by cleaning double the amount of clothes simultaneously.

Plus, homeowners can control the temperature and length of cycles, and set them to start, while they're out of the house using an app.

LG's latest washing machine uses a Twin Wash system to clean two loads simultaneously. The machine has a main washer above a smaller washer in the pedestal beneath (pictured). LG said the the mini washer is perfect for items that need specific settings, and it can also be fitted to any of LG's front loading machines

The Twin Wash System was announced during LG's press conference at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. 

It is powered by the mini washer, which LG calls the 'world's first compact washer in a hide-away pedestal, generating a whole new set of washing options.'

For example, muddy gym wear can be separated from whites, or silk underwear can be washed at the same time as towels on a hot wash.

When not in use, the mini washer acts simply as the pedestal for the main washer, but it can also be combined with any of LG's front loading washers. 

The system is Wi-Fi and NFC enabled and is fitted with LG's SmartThinQ technology.

This means users can program cycles using an app, including the temperature and length, while they're at work, or on their way home.

LG also showcased its latest 'Door-In-Door' fridge.Shelves are built into the first set of doors, which then open around a second set of doors, and the main fridge compartment. LG claims it stops up to 47 per cent of cold air escaping each time the fridge is opened, which saves energy and keeps food fresher for longer

While the NFC tagging technology, means users can download pre-programmed wash cycles to their smartphones, and start them by touching the phone on the machine. 

It also has a Smart Diagnosis feature that helps users to quickly identify issues and faults.

The South Korean tech giant also used the event to announce its next-generation flexible phone, called G Flex 2.

It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 64-bit octa-core processor, with 2GB of RAM.

The 5.5-inch full HD curved display has a 1080 x 1920 pixel resolution and a 403 Pixel Per Inch density.

It runs Android Lollipop and the whole device is said to be 30 per cent more durable than the original model.   

These machines additionally have LG's TurboWash technology that uses twin nozzles at the front of the washer to spray a concentrated detergent solution directly onto the clothes.

A high pressure nozzle above the drum then sprays water particles through the clothes during high spin cycles for quick and effective rinsing.

This speeds up the washes further.  

Prices and a release date for the Twin Wash system and machines has not yet been announced. 

'One might be tempted to call the LG Twin Wash System disruptive, as it's a completely new concept in appliances,' said Seong-jin Jo, president and boss of the LG Electronics Home Appliance and Air Solution Company. 

'The addition of a mini washer underneath the main washer translates to greater flexibility, convenience and efficiency. 

'It's also another big leap forward in our commitment to using cutting-edge technology and innovative ideas to make life better for consumers around the world.'

LG also showcased its latest 'Door-In-Door' fridge at the event.

Shelves are built into the first set of doors, which then open around a second set of doors, and the main fridge compartment. 

Called Model LPXS346C, the new Door-In-Door fridge model has 34 cubic feet of space, and LG claims it stops up to 47 per cent of cold air escaping each time the fridge is opened. 

This is because the whole fridge isn't opened each time, which saves energy and keeps food fresher for longer.

Rob Kerr, mobiles expert at uSwitch.com, told MailOnline: 'From an ergonomic point of view, you can see why a phone with a bend would be more comfortable when making a call, curving from ear to mouth, or when slotted into your back pocket. 

'Ultimately, though, the curved body is more a gimmick than a standout feature. Fortunately, the updated specs mean this smartphone has plenty more to shout about.'
