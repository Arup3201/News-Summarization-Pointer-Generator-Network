Eternally youthful supermodel Yasmin Le Bon is named the face of the British Heart Foundation's Tunnel of Love art and fashion party.

Stepping into the shoes of Daisy Lowe who fronted the campaign last year, the model, who is exactly twice her predecessor's age, looks effortlessly stunning in promotional images released today.

The star-studded fundraiser is due to happen on November 12 with tickets costing £3,500 for a table of ten.

The fashion and art party is now in its third year and will take place at coveted London venue One Mayfair.

This year is set to be the best yet, 
with guests treated to a champagne reception, sumptuous dinner and the 
most extraordinary fashion, art and games.

The last two years have seen top names from the worlds of art and fashion come together to raise funds for the British Heart Foundation.

Past auction items include pieces by Sir Peter Blake, Damien Hirst, Dan Baldwin and Jim Dine alongside brands including Cartier, Mulberry, Claridge’s, Sisley, Diane von Furtsenberg, Jil Sander, Chanel, Hermes, Timothy Everest, Barbour and Tod’s.

This year’s Associate Sponsor is 
jewellery and watches brand Thomas Sabo, who have created a unique Open 
Your Heart pendant combining rose and white gold with real diamond 
settings.

Previous faces of the event include 2011's Erin O’Connor as well as Daisy Lowe last year.

Other guests that have joined the party in past years include Alexa Chung, Cara Delevingne, Pixie Geldof, Sir Peter Blake, Alice Temperley, Laura Bailey, Suki Waterhouse, Sir Harold Tilman, Katie Hillier, Adrian Lester, Lara Bohinc, Oliver Proudlock, David Gandy and Hilary Alexander.

All proceeds from the event will help the BHF continue its 'fight for every heartbeat'.

Coronary heart disease is the UK’s single biggest killer and 'so many people need our help,' says the foundation. 'From babies born with life-threatening heart problems to the many Mums, Dads and Grandparents who survive a heart attack. Every pound raised makes a huge difference.'

Tickets are now on sale at £3,500 per table of ten.
