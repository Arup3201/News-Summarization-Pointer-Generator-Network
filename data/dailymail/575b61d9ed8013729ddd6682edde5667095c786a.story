A troubled socialite who pleaded guilty to dealing drugs from her Range Rover in wealthy suburbs says there wasn't ‘anything difficult about it’ as she hit back at reports she may face up to 10 years behind bars.

Lisa Stockbridge is due to be sentenced next month for selling cocaine and ecstasy after police bugged her car in 2013 and busted her delivering drugs to buyers in some of Sydney's exclusive suburbs.  

The 42-year-old mother, who stepped down from her entertainment company Urban Society on Wednesday, published a lengthy post on social media after A Current Affair aired a story recounting her double life as a drug dealer.

'I want to make one point very clear: 1000 pills + 94g of cocaine + $33,000 does not = 10 year gaol,' she wrote on Facebook.

'On averages, what I'm looking at is a 4 year head sentence with probably 2 years parole and 2 years gaol time... minus my 8 months served.'

A Current Affair re-enacted the 'sophisticated drug ring' Stockbridge had set up and confronted her on the street for a segment that aired on Wednesday night ahead of her sentencing next month.

The program recreated a series of drug deals one day in November 2013 where she collected $5,750 between 4.40pm and 7.30pm from nine deliveries across Sydney.  

'The money they're quoting that I made on the night re-enacted is gross of course, not profit,' Stockbridge wrote.

'I'm not sure how anyone could run a sophisticated drug ring from the front seat of their car? And besides, there really isn't anything difficult about it whatsoever.'

Court documents revealed Stockbridge supplied drugs on an ongoing basis to some 198 customers and would deliver them using her Range Rover and Nissan Tiida registered to Urban Society

Stockbridge was arrested at her Darlinghurst home in December 2013 and police found more than 380g of a substance containing MDMA, under 95g of a substance that contained cocaine, a cutting tool for cocaine, resealable bags, 10 mobile phones and $33,620 in cash.

Court documents revealed Stockbridge supplied drugs on an ongoing basis to some 198 customers she had saved in her phone and would deliver them using her Range Rover and Nissan Tiida registered to Urban Society.

The court was also told she sent messages to customers with special deals, including 'buy two grams and get the third half price'.

Police started recording evidence of the transactions by bugging her car in September 2013 - a fact Stockbridge says she knew and was careful about.

Stockbridge, who started Urban Society in 2010, revealed in her lengthy post that she turned to dealing drugs to help keep her company afloat.

'I believed so much in the concept I had developed with Urban Society, that I made the decision to liquidate everything I owned and worked for my whole life to fund the business,' she wrote.

She said in the first year of business, it ended up costing her just under $250,000 - a sum she hadn't factored and ended up borrowing money from a friend.

'I then needed to pay that money back. One thing led to another and I had two choices: a) find a way to pay back the money or b) fold the company,' she said.

'After all the blood, sweat and tears and my whole life's work in this company, I wasn't about to loose (sic) everything so I did what I had to do to get myself out of a situation where I felt I was trapped.'

Stockbridge said the people closest to her weren't aware of what she was doing and claims it wasn't anything to do with greed.

She hit back at comments made by Daily Mail Australia that her staff were left high and dry when she was arrested in 2013.

'Naturally, because I was arrested, I couldn't pay them. There was no-one who could have done this for me as it would have involved chasing money. They took everything else off me,' she wrote.

'I’m sick of hearing comments insinuating that I didn't pay them on purpose. I do intend to pay them back that last week's pay and I am chasing outstanding money and getting into trouble for it.

'It was never my intention to hurt anyone. I was just trying to fix a bad situation and I didn't do a very good job of it. Now I will pay for that error of judgement for the rest of my life.'
