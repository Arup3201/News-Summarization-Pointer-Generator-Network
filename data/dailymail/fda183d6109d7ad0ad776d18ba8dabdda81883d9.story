It's officially British summertime and for millions of women that means the inevitable countdown to baring it all on the beach.

But struggling into a skimpy bikini after a winter of comfort food and covering up is rarely a moment women look forward to.

It comes as no surprise then that the classic one-piece has been voted the number one swimsuit of choice this summer, with over half of insecure Britons opting for the more conservative style.

Covering up: Like Rihanna, Sam Faiers and Amy Childs, over half of Brits are now opting for one-piece swimsuits over bikinis this summer

In comparison just 8 per cent of us would dare to bare in a two-piece bikini style and a tiny 1 per cent of Brits confirm they wouldn't brave it with a thong shaped swimsuit.

One fashion e-tailer has seen sales of swimsuits soar 80 per cent over the last month as the warm weather hits and holiday fever sets in.

Following in the footsteps of celebrities such as Rihanna and Amy Childs, sales of one-piece swimsuits on Bay.co.uk Fashion Gallery have shot up by 110 per cent, with sales of tankinis not far behind, rising 60 per cent since this time last month.

The research also found that over a quarter of Brits only start preparations to perfect their beach bodies just a few days ahead of their holiday and over a third of Brits admitted that they carry out no preparation at all.

So despite what your gloating Facebook friends are telling you, only one in 10 kick start their beach body routine six months or more before hitting the pool side.

Style watch: The triangle/halter neck bikini is most favoured in Wales, while a bandeau style would most likely be spotted on Londoners

According to a 'Swimwear map of Britain' put together by the e-tailer, Yorkshire
ladies are the most daring when it comes to their choices in swimwear, 
with one in five of those surveyed from the area opting for a push-up 
bikini. 

Women from Northern Ireland are the most conservative, with a massive 73 per cent opting for a one-piece style.

The triangle/halter neck bikini is most favoured in Wales with 17 per cent opting for this look.

A bandeau style is most likely to be spotted on Londoners with one in 10 women from London choosing this option.

A spokesman for eBay said: ‘With the warm weather setting in, we are seeing a huge increase in the sales of swimwear on the site with sales of the classic one-piece style overtaking bikini sales for the first time.'
