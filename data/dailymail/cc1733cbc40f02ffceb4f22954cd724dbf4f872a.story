The 
56-year-old widowed TV host, who got engaged in the Hamptons over Labor Day Weekend, told Access Hollywood: 'It’s not like I’m 22 and I’m going to plan a big thing with a big, fluffy, fancy dress.'

Currently they do not have a date set for their big day, but Ms Couric envisions it being after her youngest daughter, Carrie, 17, completes her senior year of high school.

Keeping it low-key: Katie Couric has revealed that she is planning a 'tasteful' wedding to her 50-year-old investment banker fiance, John Molner

Because she and Mr Molner both have children from previous marriages, she says she wants to 'do what’s tasteful and right.'

'I want to do something that feels right for us and our situation.'

She said that her recent engagement came as a bit of a surprise to her daughters Carrie and Ellie, 22.

'It's not like I’m 22 and I’m going to plan a big thing with a big, fluffy, fancy dress'

'I think they were a little [like] "Wow," because it's been the three of us for so long,' Ms Couric explained. However, she noted that the 'really think the world' of him, and he also 'loves them so.'

Her daughters' father, first husband Jay Monahan, died in 1998 at age 42 of colon cancer.

Ms Couric revealed on Kelly and Michael last week that Mr Molner's proposal was also a shock for her.

'He
completely surprised me and took me for a walk on the beach,' she said recalling the romantic moment which took place in East Hampton, New York.

Wedding bells: 'I'm betrothed, I'm engaged to be married,' she said, debuting her stunning diamond ring

She told of how 'he poured [her] a glass 
of rose,' and began talking about how he was '100per cent committed' and
wanted to spend the rest of his life with her.

When she still failed to take the hint, he finally told her: 'I brought you here for a reason. I'm trying to propose to you.' 

'And then he pulled out a box and I was like, "What?"' she recounted with a grin.

For
his part, the 50-year-old finance executive told People that he was 
happy with how the proposal turned out, even if it took Ms Couric a 
moment to realize what was happening.

'It was a surprise to her. I was excited to catch her in a moment of confusion, which is pretty rare,' he said.

Last, Ms Couric also made an appearance on Good Morning America
to talk to George Stephanopoulos about her return to TV, as well as 
show off her new bling.

'I'm betrothed, I'm engaged to be 
married,' she said, debuting her stunning diamond ring, which she paired
with a bright purple dress and matching lilac eye shadow.

'I'm betrothed, I'm engaged to be 
married . . . It's a really exciting development in my life'

'So that's a really exciting development in my life.'

Ms Couric told People in 2011 that she always imagined herself as a 'modern-day' version of the twice married TV character, Carol Brady.

Speaking about dating following the death of her first husband, she said: 'I thought, it's important for me to go out. I'm always excited to meet new people and have a social life.

'I thought, it's important for me to go out. I'm always excited to meet new people and have a social life'

'I think dating is fun actually. I enjoy that part of my life.'

However, after several failed relationships she worried she would never find another life partner.

Unexpected: 'He completely surprised me and took me for a walk on the beach,' she said of John Molner's (right) proposal in East Hampton, New York, adding that she had no idea what was coming

'I had a series of relationships . . . but they didn't seem right for the long haul,' she said.

But in early 2012 she met 50-year-old Mr Molner after being set up through mutual friends and they soon hit it off.

They first went public with their relationship in April 2012 and Ms Couric said later that year, 'He's great. He's from Chicago. I love Midwesterners!'

She told People that she knew he was a 'keeper' when he agreed to go to a grocery store with her mother, and helped her find generic - and cheap - pain reliever.

'Mom's a big bargain hunter, and John rose to the occasion, I thought, "Wow this guy is pretty good."'

Mr Molner, who also has two children from a previous marriage, is said to have been a fan of Ms Couric's for some time. When he met her, he said he fell for her instantly.

'Meeting Katie really changed my life . . . I couldn't be happier,' he exclaimed.
