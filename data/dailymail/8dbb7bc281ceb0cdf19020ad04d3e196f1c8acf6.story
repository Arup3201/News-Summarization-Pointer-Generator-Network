A Greek journalist was hauled before a court yesterday for revealing the names of more than 2,000 alleged tax cheats.

Costas Vaxevanis is accused of violating privacy laws by publishing the details of wealthy compatriots who have HSBC bank accounts in Switzerland.

At a time of unprecedented austerity in Greece, his exposure of allegations involving £1.6billion have taken on huge significance.

Led away: Kostas Vaxevanis was giving a radio interview in Athens when officers stormed into the studio saying he had to cut the segment short 'to be arrested'

Mr Vaxevanis, who edits the magazine Hot Doc, insisted he had acted in the public interest.

‘Journalism is revealing the truth 
when everyone else is trying to hide it,’ he said. ‘Everything else is 
just public relations. Today, it’s not Hot Doc that’s on trial but press
freedom in Greece, and truth.

‘If anyone is accountable before the 
law then it is those ministers who hid the list, lost it and said it 
didn’t exist. I only did my job. I am a journalist and I did my job.

‘The public prosecutors’ office has 
shown a special interest in its dealings with me. I don’t know why this 
is the case.’ Mr Vaxevanis was arrested on Sunday and faces two years in
prison if he is convicted. He is due to appear in the Athens court 
again on Thursday.

He was backed yesterday by the Greek daily newspaper Ta Nea, which also published the list spread over 11 news pages.

The 2,059 named Greeks, who have a 
combined £1.6billion in Swiss accounts, include dozens of prominent 
business figures and two former ministers.

The list was handed to the Greek government by the French authorities more than two years ago.

It has been nicknamed the ‘Lagarde 
List’ after Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary 
Fund who was the French finance minister when it was handed over. Greek 
authorities insist there is no evidence those included have broken the 
law.

Poesy, a union for Greek journalists, 
denounced the arrest of Mr Vaxevanis, saying the prosecutor’s actions 
threatened free speech in a country where the press is self regulated.

Opposition leader Alexis Tsipras said:
‘It is unacceptable that in Greece, which has been on its knees in 
recent years, tax evaders are left undisturbed and those who conceal 
possible evasion are not prosecuted but those who make revelations are.’

Court officials say the two politicians on the list have been referred to parliament for investigation.

The list has highlighted deep 
divisions in a country which is now in its fifth year of recession, and 
where austerity measures have taken a heavy toll on poorer sections of 
society.

Athens is negotiating with its 
international creditors over a £10billion package of further austerity 
measures, with unemployment standing at 25 per cent.

Former ministers have faced fierce criticism for failing to thoroughly investigate those named on the list.

In testimony before a parliamentary 
committee last week, George Papaconstantinou, who was finance minister 
when the list was given to the Greek authorities, said he had asked the 
financial crime squad to investigate 20 individuals. Evangelos 
Venizelos, leader of the PASOK socialist party and also a former finance
minister, said he had been given a data stick containing the list a 
year ago by a senior investigator, but was unsure if this was the 
original.

Earlier this month, Mr Venizelos said 
he had handed the drive to prime minister Antonis Samaras when he 
realised no other copy of it existed.

Wall of fire: Riot police are engulfed in flame by a petrol bomb thrown by protesters. Greek trade unions called a 24-hour general strike to oppose new austerity measures just last week

Flare-up: Athens has seen hundreds of anti-austerity protests - many violent - over the past three years, since Greece revealed it had been misreporting key deficit figures and sank into an economic gloom so deep it has been likened to the Great Depression of the 1930s

The names were apparently taken from 
data on 24,000 HSBC customers that the bank reported stolen in 2010, 
potentially exposing many international clients to prosecution by tax 
authorities if they failed to declare the assets to their home 
countries.

The bank said a former IT employee with HSBC, who is known to the French authorities, had obtained the information.
