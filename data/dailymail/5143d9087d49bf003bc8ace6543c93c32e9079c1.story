Everton have spoken to Wolfsburg about a potential move for Croatia winger Ivan Perisic.

The 25-year-old is valued at £8million and Everton scouts have watched him closely in the Bundesliga and playing for his national side notably against Australia in their pre-World Cup warm-up game and Brazil on Thursday night.

Perisic only joined Wolfsburg from Dortmund 18 months ago but they are looking at strengthening in other areas and will weigh up the strength of any Everton bid.

Perisic can play on the wing, as an attacking midfielder or as a second striker.

He is quick, has good technique and gets goals, often spectacular, and is comfortable on the right or left.

Everton have looked at promising young Heerenveen Hakim Zyech who is considerably cheaper and Barcelona's Cristian Tello but the latter seems likely to form part of the deal that will take another Croat Ivan Rakitic from Sevilla to Barcelona.

Thinking: Gareth Barry is currently considering a contract offer to stay a Everton

Chairman Bill Kenwright is continuing to work on a deal for Romelu Lukaku from Chelsea but faces strong competition while Gareth Barry is deliberating over their two year contract offer with the option for a third year.

West Ham retain an interest in Barry but they should also sign Cheikhou Kouyate from Anderlecht on Monday following his medical.

As reported last week, Everton are in the mix for long-term target Bruno Martins Indi and have interest in his teammate Stefan de Vrij and Jeremain Lens of Dinamo Kiev.

Newcastle back in for Lasogga

Newcastle have revived a deal for Hertha Berlin striker Pierre-Michel Lasogga and may get it concluded this week. The 22-year-old made it clear to his club that he was keen on a move to England after holding a meeting with Hertha Berlin’s general manager Michael Preetz last week.

The belief was he would choose between staying with Hertha or going back on loan to Hamburg where he spent last season.

Lasogga scored 13 goals in 20 appearances for Hamburg but he has only one year left on contract. Newcastle have been quoted £10m but Lasogga is ready to push for the move and they hope that will help drive down the price.

Moving on: Free agent Bafetimbi Gomis (right) will talk to other clubs after a move to Newcastle stalled

A move for free agent Bafetimbi Gomis though has stalled and the free agent is due to talk to other clubs this week.

As Newcastle look to bring in at least one player, Hatem Ben Arfa is weighing up lucrative offers to leave.

The French midfielder's representatives are in advanced talks with Qatari side Lekhwiya, who are due to appoint Michael Laudrup as manager.

Al Sadd also want Ben Arfa and Barcelona midfielder Xavi. As reported last week, El Arabi have already offered Xavi a three year deal worth £21million and Ben Arfa is considering offers reputedly worth £7m a year.

Ayew going to move to Premier League?

Jordan Ayew will be looking to impress Premier League scouts at Monday's World Cup fixture with USA.

The Marseille forward hit a hat-trick as Ghana swept aside South Korea 4-0 in their final warm-up match earlier this month and that has put clubs back on his trail.

The 22-year-old has been linked with Hull City and West Bromwich Albion in the past and they are among the clubs who will watch his performances for Ghana.

His representative Willie McKay said: 'Jordan is playing very well and he wants to show English Premier League clubs what he can do. There's a lot of interest gathering and a move to England appeals to him.'

Ayew is the son of Abedi Pele and his older brother Andre also plays for Marseille.

Chamakh wants to stay

Free agent Marouane Chamakh has confirmed he wants to stay in the Premier League, even if he fails to agree a new deal at Crystal Palace.

Chamakh is out of contract later this month after signing a one year deal last summer but hopes to resolve his future before July. He scored six goals last season was key in helping Palace stay up under Tony Pulis's impressive management.

Chamakh, who is also represented by Willie McKay, said: 'I am out of contract and if I do not stay at Crystal Palace I want to stay in England. I love playing in the Premier League and I was really happy with how things went last season.

'It took me a while to settle when I 
first came to England, like it does most players when they first come to
 the Premier League, but I am happy when I am playing and I want to 
continue doing that in the Premier League.'

Inter want Mbia

Inter Milan have an interest in QPR midfielder Stephane Mbia. Talks are ongoing between Rubin Kazan and Inter over the sale of Yann M'Vila but failure to reach agreement will prompt Inter to ask about Mbia who has enjoyed an impressive season on loan at Sevilla. QPR, meanwhile, are among clubs rivalling Arsenal for Serge Aurier.

The Ivory Coast right-back impressed against Japan at the weekend and Toulouse are hoping to cash in. The £7m price tag may be a little steep for Harry Redknapp's plans though.

Fulham sign Hutchinson

Fulham have signed Shaun Hutchinson from Motherwell. The 23-year-old is a product of the famous Wallsend Boys Club and was out of contract at Motherwell.

Felix Magath has moved to sign the 6ft 2ins young centre-back after the club released Brede Hangeland.

Hutchinson also had interest from Wolves and Rangers. He made his debut for Motherwell at the tender age of 17, and said: 'It was a difficult decision to leave Motherwell and I had to really think hard about it.

'It has been a fantastic apprenticeship for me and I am very appreciative of what everyone at the club has done.

The fans have also been brilliant and I want to personally thank them for their support.'However, this is a great opportunity at Fulham and I can’t wait to get started.'

Fulham also had an interest in Liverpool defender Martin Kelly who is likely to be offloaded by the Anfield club. However, relegation scuppered that for Fulham with Kelly attracting Premier League interest.
