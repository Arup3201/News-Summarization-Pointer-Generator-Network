The National Basketball Association's first ever female union leader has given an ominous warning to any critics who may doubt her leadership skills based on her gender.

While introducing herself to over 100 NBA players at a private meeting in Las Vegas last month, Michele Roberts used the opportunity make an impression on the athletes. And it was a strong one.

'My past,' she told the roomful of men whose million-dollar contracts she would soon represent, 'is littered with the bones of men who were foolish enough to think I was someone they could sleep on.' 

Formidable: Michele Roberts issued an ominous warning to anyone who may underestimate her abilities as the first female leader of a major North American sports union

The startling statement came after the high-power Washington attorney rattled off her considerable resume--UC Berkeley Law School, partner at a prestigious firm--but still sensed the gender question at the tip of everyone in the private meeting's tongues.

'I bet you can tell I'm a woman,' she said cooly, 'and I suspect the rest of the world can, too.'

Soon after, she won 32 of 34 votes to clench her new position, reports the New York Times.

It capped a long and arduous process to replace Billy Hunter, who was ousted in February 2013. Roberts was one of the finalists initially offered to the rank-and-file during All-Star weekend in February, but the process was re-opened under another search committee at the urging of some players and agents.

More than 100 players reconvened in Las Vegas that week, and after some tense moments leading up to the vote, Roberts emerged as the winner.

'Obviously, I would've preferred that it happen sooner rather than later, but I completely understood when there were questions raised about the process,' Roberts said. 'Frankly, I would not have wanted them to ignore those questions and not affirmatively address those concerns. I wanted the job in February, but I wanted the job where there would be no questions about the fairness or the process, so I completely endorsed the executive committee to address these questions, and they did and now best I can tell they're very pleased.'

Foe: New NBA Commissioner Adam Silver may be re-examining his expectations of after Roberts described her past as 'littered with the bones of men' who've underestimated her. He'll be one of her opponents at union negotiations

The players considered more than 300 candidates during their 17-month search before picking Roberts, who has been called the finest trial lawyer in Washington by 'Washingtonian Magazine.' She said her new job will feature straight, honest talk, just like she delivers to a jury, and the strategizing that made her such a successful lawyer.

The search to replace Hunter, who led the NBPA from 1996 until a review of the union was critical of his business practices, leaves players with less than two years to prepare for the next potential collective bargaining talks. Either the union or the league can opt out of the current agreement in 2017.

The union has struggled for years with in-fighting and a lack of organization, and the players took a significant cut in their guarantee of basketball-related income — 57 percent to about 50 percent, a drop of hundreds of millions annually in salary costs — in the contentious lockout in 2011. League revenues are on the rise, a new TV contract is set to be negotiated in 2016 and franchise valuations are skyrocketing.

'As far as I'm concerned, preparations for CBA negotiations started yesterday,' Roberts said. 'It's at the top of my list of things that I've been instructed to begin the process of preparing for, and sure it's a lot to do, but I've never been shy about hard work and long hours, so we'll get it done. We'll be ready.'

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver congratulated Roberts in a statement, saying he looked forward to working with her 'to ensure the continued health and growth of our game.'

'The partnership between our players and teams is the backbone of the league, and we are eager to continue working with the Players Association to build this relationship,' Silver said.

The fallout from the lockout and the Hunter ouster left the union reeling. But it also made Roberts want to get involved, which will bring the New York native back home.

'The more I thought about it,' she said, 'the more I thought that would be a great opportunity to do something really important.'
