A talented unicycle rider races against a jeep in a a thrilling high speed race down a mountainside in rural Austria.

Specialist unicycle rider Gerald Rosenkranz from the Graz region in Austria was chosen to ride the unicycle against the jeep as a result of a novel idea by 19-year-old Martin Gruja.

Mr Gruja said he had always wanted to film a unique event that people would always remember.

The teenager subsequently organised a race involving the unicycle and the  jeep which was filmed on Schöckl Mountain in Graz.

Two of Mr Gruja's friends Philipp Neubauer and Moritz Wehr assisted him with the film-making process.

Challenge: The jeep races through a waterlogged country road during the memorable race

Speaking about why he wanted to create the entertaining video the teenager said the unusual element of the race appealed to him.

'I think the idea with the pickup truck challenging the uni-cyclist came because I love the unusual, and I wanted to create something unique that makes people all over the world watch this and say wow,' Mr Gruja said. 'I've never seen something like that in my life, that was crazy!' 

During the video the unicycle is seen racing cross-country down the mountainside while the driver of the jeep takes a more conventional route on the mountain road.

Off again: Moments later the unicycle rider sprints off downhill again

Shortly afterwards while the confident jeep driver has pulled in for a break and a cold drink on the side of the road the uni-cyclist emerges from the bushes and rushes past the vehicle.

The uni-cyclist also comically enters a bar and emerges through the other side before moving his uni-cycle up on a table which is surrounded by astonished drinkers and beer glasses.

Moments later Mr Rosenkranz dashes off into the countryside again and he subsequently manages to beat his opponent in the jeep by the slenderest of margins.

Mr Gruja said he was very happy that they managed to shoot the entire footage in a single day.

The shoot took place between 5am and 10pm on the day of the shoot while the editing and post production took about one month. 

Finish: After a memorable race the unicycle rider makes it down ahead of the jeep which brings him away
