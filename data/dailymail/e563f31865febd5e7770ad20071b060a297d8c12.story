He may only be six but Spencer Conn already seems destined for a major league career.

For the five consecutive times that the Little Leaguer stepped up to the plate, he hit home runs on his first pitch.

As the Grayson, Georgia, child sprinted around the bases, the crowd cheered loudly and his tiny teammates waited at the home plate to celebrate with him.

Homer: Spencer heads for third base as he makes one of five home runs

What is most impressive however, is that over two games in two days, Spencer repeated the feat five times as a coach pitched to him.

In his game on the first day, Spencer managed three home runs on his first pitch, and the next day repeated the same feat twice.

On each occasion Spencer high-fived his coach as he completed his home run, before celebrating with his Rams' team mates who can be seen rushing to the home plate as they cheer him on.

A video on YouTube showing his accomplishment has been viewed more than 90,000 times since it was posted on July 25.
