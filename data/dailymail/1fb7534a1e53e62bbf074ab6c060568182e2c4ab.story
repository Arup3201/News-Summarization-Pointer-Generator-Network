Claimed sightings: Siberian councillor Igor Idimeshev insisted he has seen yetis 'several times'

A Russian official has claimed that the yeti is an 'extraterrestrial' being sent to Earth to watch over things.

Igor Idimeshev, 48, deputy head of Sheregesh's local council in Siberia, insisted he has seen the creature - dismissed by most scientists as legend - several times.

Mr Idimeshev's comments come as his district in the Shoria Mountain area of Keremovo, is setting up a resort dedicated to the Abominable Snowman following a succession of claimed sightings.

He told the Siberian Times: 'I've seen this creature several times.

'And when I saw the yeti's eyes my only thought was that they are not from Earth - they are clearly of an extraterrestrial nature.

'To me, the yeti is an extraterrestrial creature. I believe that it is like a controller to look over things here on Earth.'

Mr Idimeshev added that the creature - known as Big Men by locals - could 'suddenly disappear and re-materialise'

He added: 'Another extraordinary thing is that yeti's hair is luminous at night, and also that the Yeti can walk on water.

'Every man round here sees him when he hunts. It's all right to mention the fact of meeting - but we don't go into the details of it, like where exactly it was, what he did do, or your luck will be gone.

'The feeling is one of fear. It is a fear that you cannot explain rationally. You feel yourself very scared and tense at the same time.

Insistence: Igor Idimeshev said the yeti is an 'extraterrestrial creature' that looks over things' on Earth

'One of the closest comparisons is the feeling of looking into a wolf's eyes. If you've ever seen them - I mean a wild wolf,  not a caged animal - you remember a feeling of them being something very unusual, alien.

'Like with a wolf, you can see a yeti's eyes from a distance of some 100-150 metres. They are quite hypnotising. 

'And when I saw yeti's eyes my only thought was that they are not from Earth - they are clearly of an extraterrestrial nature. 

'To me, the yeti is an extraterrestrial creature. I believe that its like a controller to look over things here on Earth.'

Tourism: The district in the Shoria Mountain area of Keremovo is setting up a Abominable Snowman resort

The planned Yeti Park in Sheregesh, including a hotel and a museum, is intended to bring in tourists keen to be the first to prove the existence of the yeti.

The region's governor Aman Tuleyev has offered a £20,500 reward - one million roubles - to anyone who can catch a yeti and prove its existence.  'I'll sit down with him, chat and have a cup of tea,' he promised.

Last year Russian academic Professor Valentin Sapunov claimed a population of 200 yeti exist in  the Kemerovo, Khakassia and Altai regions of Siberia.

Ancestors? The Japanese snow monkey bears a striking resemblance to the legendary creature

Expeditions to the remote Azasskaya Cave in the region found samples of hair still awaiting DNA analysis. 

Apparatchik Idimeshev admitted he will never reveal full details of his  close encounters with yetis.

He said: 'The only person I ever told everything in detail to was my mother - and she taught me to keep it to myself. 

''People will simply think you've made it up', she told me.'

Proof: The Daily Mail backed an expedition in 1954 in search of evidence of the creature's existence
