Sunderland are monitoring the situation of Charlie Austin and could make a move for the Queens Park Rangers striker this summer.

The 25-year-old's goalscoring exploits haven’t gone unnoticed. Austin netted 20 times for QPR in his first year at Loftus Road – despite also being out for the entirety of February and March – following a £4million switch from Burnley.

Wanted man: QPR striker Charlie Austin is wanted by Sunderland manager Gus Poyet

Goal threat: Austin scored 28 times for QPR to help them get promoted to the Premier League

Not for sale: Harry Redknapp is not likely to oversee the sale of Austin without a fight

Austin, who has two years left on his contract, carried a heavy threat in front of goal for Redknapp and was the only man at the club to score more than six goals.

Gus Poyet is looking to offload Danny Graham and there remain doubts over the fitness of Jozy Altidore heading into the new Premier League campaign after he suffered a hamstring problem at the World Cup.

Poyet is hopeful that the USA frontman will be firing when they travel to West Brom on August 16, while Austin is a player he has previous links with.

During his spell in charge at Brighton, the Uruguayan was a keen admirer of Austin and launched a bid to take the ex-Swindon man to the Amex Stadium.

Redknapp is likely to repel any offers given the dearth of attack-minded players currently at his disposal and with talk rife that Loic Remy will be on his way out of the club this month.

Unwanted: Sunderland are willing to allow striker Danny Graham to leave the club this summer

Depth: Sunderland are also concerned about the fitness of Jozy Altidore who was injured at the World Cup
