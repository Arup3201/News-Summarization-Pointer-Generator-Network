Identified: The round-faced young man in this 18th century portrait has finally been identified as Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart

For centuries the identity of the young, grey-haired man in an 18th century portrait has puzzled experts.

But the mystery man has now been identified as none other than composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

Experts at Salzburg's Mozarteum museum have concluded that the model is indeed the musical genius.

Mozart was usually depicted in portraits wearing a powdered white wig, one reason why his identification has taken so long.

The researchers said that of 14 known portraits, it is one of the only pictures to show him gazing directly at the viewer and without the wig.

Expert Cristoph Grosspietch says the 
museum's findings are based on examinations of the portrait and 
historical records from the era.

A laborious process tried to match other verified portraits of the composer with the mystery painting, produced by an unknown artist.

Mr Grosspietch said that the same team of experts concluded 
that another portrait, showing a youth holding a bird's nest, was not 
Mozart, as had previously been believed.

The Austrian is one of the most celebrated composers of the classical era, having inspired western popular music in the centuries since his death in 1971.

He composed over 600 works over his lifetime. He was described by tenor Michael Kelly, in his Reminiscences as 'a remarkably small man, very thin and pale, with a profusion of fine, fair hair of which he was rather vain'.
