Embattled former tennis ace Jennifer Capriati has been slapped with battery and stalking charges stemming from an alleged altercation with her ex-boyfriend on Valentine's Day.

Palm Beach County court records show Capriati was issued a summons yesterday to appear before a judge on  April 17 on the two charges.

She has not been arrested.

Charged: Capriati, 36, allegedly got into an argument with ex-boyfriend Ivan Brannan, a former Florida State University golfer, on February 14 at a Palm Beach gym in Florida

Allegations: Ivan Brannan claims Capriati beat him up at a Florida gym on Valentine's Day

North Palm Beach police said that Capriati's ex-boyfriend, Ivan Brannan, was working out at a gym on February 14 when the 36-year-old Capriati approached him and began yelling at him.

Brannan told police that he tried to get away by walking to the men's locker room, but Capriati blocked his path and punched him in the chest.

He said that he and Capriati broke up in 2012 and that she has been harrassing and stalking him since.

Brannan, 28, also claims that Capriati stalked him and called his workplace more than 100 times in a single day last year.

In January 2012, Capriati reportedly showed up at his workplace and banged on the windows, the New York Post reported.

Questions: North Palm Beach County police are considering charges of battery and stalking in connection with the incident at Oxygen Health and Fitness gym involving the tennis pro

The tennis pro's lawyer, Steve Sessa,
called the police report is 'one-sided' and the story which was 
circulating was an 'over-exaggeration'.

Brannan, a former Florida State University golfer, asked the Palm Beach County Circuit Court for a restraining order 
against Capriati last year, but the judge declined the request.

He
also claims that she sped through a security gate at his condo building in her
Porsche after a guard declined her requests to be let in. 

Another one of Brannan's exes, however, has come to Capriati's defense, saying that he also tried to blame her for an attack.

Christine Corley, who starred on 
Gordon Ramsay's MasterChef, offered her support to Capriati via Twitter 
on Saturday, saying that Brannan called the police on her to report that she had also stalked and assaulted him.

Capriati
allegedly hit 28-year-old Brannan's chest with her fists several times 
before a yoga instructor intervened. Brannan then ran into the men's 
locker room and called 911.

Capriati fled the scene in her car but was stopped by police a few miles away. They allowed her to go at the time.

Ms Corley, who has a three-year-old son with Brannan, tweeted on Saturday: 'See I'm not crazy! --- this is the father of my child --! HILARIOUS...'

The chef told Gossip Extra: 'He is doing to Jennifer Capriati what he did to me... This man is just a master manipulator.'

The single mother added that Brannan had accused her of hitting him but that no charges were ever filed.

Capriati was only ten when she made her Sports Illustrated debut and. By 13, she was on the cover.

She won Olympic gold in 1992 at age 16 and two years later, she was out of the game and into legal trouble when she was cited for shoplifting and arrested for marijuana possession.
