An
over-protective son was jailed for life today after killing his mother’s toyboy lover with a kitchen knife.

Manchester Crown Court heard how Ben Edgar, 20, was jealous of his 43-year-old mother's partner Mark Wood, 28, overtaking him as man of the house.

Edgar killed Mr Wood just weeks after telling one family
friend: 'I swear to God, if he goes near my mum and I’m here, I will kill him -
I will do the time for him.'

Ben Edgar (left), 20, was told today at Manchester Crown Court that he must serve at least 12 years for stabbing to death Mark Wood (right), 28, at their shared address in Little Lever, Bolton, in June this year

Caught in the middle: Edgar's mother, Samantha Bird (pictured) lived with her son and her partner Mr Wood in Ashston Street, Bolton, and endured a 'volatile' relationship with Mr Wood, Manchester Crown Court heard

He
then dialled 999 telling an operator: 'You best shut the f*** up and get here
or I’m gonna murder you all.'

Mr Wood was stabbed in the neck with a 37cm
kitchen knife and died later in hospital.

Edgar
was said to have been furious after his mother Samantha Bird, 43, claimed Wood
had beaten her up during an argument at their family home in Little Lever,
Bolton, Greater Manchester.

It
was claimed he also resented the fact Wood lived at the property and believed
that he, as Mrs Bird’s son, 'should be the only man in the house'.

Manchester
Crown Court was told the tragedy occurred after Wood moved in with Mrs Bird who
was 15 years his senior and worked as a call centre worker for a claims firm in
Bury.

Miss
Katherine Blackwell QC prosecuting said the couple’s relationship was 'extremely
volatile with violence and threats of violence being used against the other.'

She
added: 'A grudge had been harboured against Mr Wood by the defendant for some
considerable time and this defendant, fueled with a mixture of hatred and
jealousy, seized the opportunity to kill him.

'The
reason given for the hatred was that the defendant’s mother had been in violent
relationships in the past and the defendant didn’t want the same to develop
with Mr Wood.

Jealous: Edgar, pictured here with his mother Samantha Bird, feared that her partner, Mr Wood, would overtake him as man of the house

Protective: Edgar (pictured being kissed by his mother) was said to be concerned for his mother as she had been in violent relationships in the past and he didn't want the same to develop with Mr Wood

'The
defendant said he didn’t like the fact the deceased was living in the house and
that he, the defendant, should be the only man in the house.'

The
court heard during a row on Easter Sunday this year, Edgar and Wood squared up to
each other at the family house.

Wood began calling Edgar a 'psycho' to which Edgar
retorted: 'I am the man of the house - I will wipe you out' before Mrs Bird
split them up.

The
following month, in May, Edgar texted his girlfriend saying: 'Just had a word wit
my mum about money and I z ur guna leave me skint.

'Since
she as got with tht n** she cum awful wit me n I’m sick off it.' Another said: 'were is e cz I’m gunna broke his legs.'

He
also texted his mother saying: 'What as axacally gone on mum cz mark as just
rang me saying e asn’t hit u - mum r u okay n plz will u tell me whats gne on
so I can get all sorted out.'

Violent: The court heard that during a row on Easter Sunday this year, Edgar and Wood squared up to each other at the family house during which Edgar said: 'I am the man of the house - I will wipe you out' before Mrs Bird split them up

When
she responded: 'I hit Mark yesterday he throw me on the bed and the weight
bench it my knee' Edgar retorted: 'I was ready for kill sum1 last nyt.'

Tragedy
struck on June 11 after Wood and Mrs Bird had gone to the England v France Euro
2011 match at a pub. Back at the house a row erupted between the couple in
their bedroom and Edgar stormed upstairs to intervene.

He
grabbed Wood in a headlock saying he would not let go until the victim had
calmed down.

In a further argument downstairs in the kitchen. he grabbed the knife
and stabbed the victim. In a phone call to the emergency services he said: 'I
have stabbed my mum’s boyfriend.

'I
can’t stay in the house, he is dead. He is dead. He is dead.' Screams from Mrs
Bird were heard in the background.

Edgar
later claimed he acted in self-defence claiming Wood was wielding a chair.

He
denied murder claiming he thought he had picked up a fork from the draining board and
not a knife.

He insisted he had got on well with Wood and said the damning text
messages were 'figures of speech.'

Mrs
Bird giving her evidence, said her son and boyfriend got on well together and
added. 'They had a great relationship - fantastic.'

Passing
sentence Judge Andrew Gilbart QC told Edgar: 'I am in no doubt whatever that
his death occurred after he had drunkenly attacked your mother and you had
restrained him in an upstairs bedroom, where he had also threatened you with
violence.

'I
reject the Crown’s case that on that evening you had some premeditated plan to
attack Wood. The evidence of all witnesses present that evening shows that
relations between all of you were good until your mother and Wood got involved
in a drunken row.

Crime scene: Tragedy struck on June 11 after Mr Wood and Mrs Bird had a row in their bedroom. Edgar stormed upstairs to intervene

Tragedy: The row escalated and continued downstairs where Edgar knifed Mr Woods and called emergency services and said: 'I have stabbed my mum's boyfriend.'

'In
my judgement the text traffic were the angry outbursts of a young man of
limited intelligence who heard that his mother had been attacked by her
boyfriend.

'It
follows that this is a truly tragic case in which a drunken domestic argument
between Mark Wood and your mother and his drunken attack upon her, led to your
entirely justified intervention and then in very short order, his death.

'You
have been convicted of a murder charge because you went too far in dealing with
his aggression.”

After
the case Det Insp Andy Cunliffe of Greater Manchester Police said: 'Ben Edgar
held a grudge against Mark Wood because of the fraught relationship between
Mark and his mother.

'Edgar
had previously stated that he would harm Mark and on the night in question he
armed himself with a large knife and stabbed him.

'A
family has been torn apart and a much loved son, brother and father has been
killed and I would like to express my deepest sympathy to them.'

Waste: Edgar was found guilty of murder because the judge said he took his agression too far at the family home (pictured) in Ashton Street, Little Lever, Bolton in June this year
