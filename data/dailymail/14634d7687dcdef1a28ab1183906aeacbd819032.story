There was a time when Middlesbrough would not have been such outlandish underdogs against Manchester City.

In fact, it wasn't so long ago that the Teessiders inflicted one of the most humiliating defeats in City’s history.

On Saturday, they meet again in the FA Cup Fourth Round with City the overwhelming favourites to progress.

On the final day of the 2007/08 Premier League campaign City were thumped 8-1 at Middlesbrough

But just eight years ago they were unrecognisable from the club we know today.

It was on the final day of the 2007/08 campaign that Sven-Goran Eriksson’s side were thumped 8-1 at the Riverside Stadium.

The former England boss wore a haunted look as his team capitulated, suffering their biggest loss in more than 100 years.

It had been reported Erkisson already knew of his fate and that owner Thaksin Shinawatra had long since decided the Swede was not the man for the job.

The 8-1 defeat was Sven-Goran Eriksson’s last game in charge of City as he was sacked three weeks later

Middlesbrough: Schwarzer, Young (McMahon 75), Riggott, Wheater, Pogatetz, Boateng, Rochemback, Arca (Johnson 62), Downing, Sanli (Aliadiere 62), Alves.

Goals: Downing 16 pen, Alves 37, Downing 58, Alves 60, Johnson 70, Rochemback 80, Aliadiere 85, Alves 90.

Man City: Isaksson, Jihai, Corluka, Dunne, Ball, Ireland, Gelson, Petrov (Elano 71), Garrido, Vassell (Hamann 62), Benjani (Castillo 13). 

Goals: Elano 87. 

And so it proved his last game in charge. In fact, he hasn’t managed in the Premier League since.

Bizarrely, the performance of City’s players at Boro was said to be a show of support for Eriksson, a protest at the treatment of their boss.

A deliberate act of unprofessionalism or otherwise, their cause was hardly aided when Richard Dunne was sent off following a reckless challenge on Tuncay Sanli inside the penalty area after just 15 minutes.

Perhaps the sight of their skipper getting his marching orders for such a needless lunge persuaded the rest of the visiting team to throw in the towel also – either way, Boro certainly took advantage.

Stewart Downing scored from the resulting spot-kick before Alfonso Alves – the misfiring Brazilian striker – made it two before the break.

And then the floodgates opened. Downing netted the goal of the game with a with a stunning left-foot volley, before Alves sprinted clear for a fourth.

Future City star Adam Johnson came off the bench and got in on the act – albeit via a deflection off Michael Ball – and Brazilian Fabio Rochemback smashed a sixth courtesy of a powerful free-kick into the top corner.

Jeremie Aliadiere was another substitute desperate to seize upon City’s weakness and he got the seventh with a cool finish before Alves completed his hat-trick.

With the score at 7-0, Elano had nicked a goal which barely merits the term ‘consolation’.

For Eriksson, there were no positives.

The scoreline is one of the largest in Premier League history and one of City's largest-ever defeats

‘It is difficult to take whenever you lose. But, when you lose like this, it is awful,’ he said.

‘To concede a penalty and have Richard Dunne sent off was a bad start but we were in the game until it was 3-0.

‘After that, mentally we had nothing left. We were not even on the pitch - the team had totally gone and it was embarrassing for everyone.’

Remarkably, Eriksson stayed in his job for another three weeks before the axe fell. Supporters protested and handed in a 14,000-strong petition to the club.

City have certainly come a long way in the seven seasons since.
