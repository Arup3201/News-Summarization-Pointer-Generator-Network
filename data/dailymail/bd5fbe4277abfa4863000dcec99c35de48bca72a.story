Apple’s Touch ID is fast and accurate - until your hand is even the slightest bit dirty or wet.

But in the near future these scanners will not only work when your fingerprints are obscured, they will work behind layers of glass and metal.

Chip maker Qualcomm has unveiled its Sense ID 3D fingerprint scanner capable of capturing everything from ridges to sweat pores using ultrasonic technology.

The demo version (pictured) was covered in glass that measures 0.9mm thick, and Qualcomm did not reveal what the maximum thickness is. Phones running Sense ID are expected to launch later this year, but Qualcomm did not reveal to MailOnline which devices or manufacturers it is working with

A prototype version of the sensor is on display at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.

When a finger is placed on the tiny sensor - the demo version has a 9mm by 4mm ‘active area’ - the software captures an image of the fingerprint instantly.

This is stored and used to authenticate a user quickly, with little margin of error.

And because it uses waves that bounce off the surface of the finger it can be used behind materials such as glass or metal.

The demo version was covered in glass that measures 0.9mm thick, and Qualcomm did not reveal what the maximum thickness is.

The firm did say, though, that the technology makes it more accurate and powerful than capacitive sensors, like those seen on Apple and Samsung devices.

And this is the reason why it works even if the user has dirty hands, has recently applied hand lotion and other similar scenarios.

Phones running Sense ID are expected to launch later this year, but Qualcomm did not reveal to MailOnline which devices or manufacturers it is working with. 

Fujitsu has developed a ‘custom compact and high-output infrared LED’, and a custom infrared camera.

Movements of the smooth muscle of the iris make the eye’s openings larger or smaller, which in turn adjusts the amount of light that enters the retina

These were combined with Fujitsu’s camera controller technology and biometric-authentication technology.

It identifies a person by scanning the pattern of their iris.

The pattern doesn’t change significantly after the age of two, and it is difficult to injure its surface and difficult to forge.

Movements of the smooth muscle of the iris make the eye’s openings larger or smaller, which in turn adjusts the amount of light that enters the retina.

For its prototype, Fujitsu has built a miniature scanner so it fits on the front of a smartphone.

It recognises the pattern by shining an infrared LED light on the sensor into the eyes and taking a picture of the pattern with the infrared camera.

This pattern is registered and linked to the user.

Each time they look at their phone, the sensor scans their eye, matches it with the stored image and unlocks the device.

‘The system can reliably authenticate the detailed patterns of the iris and that can be used in most everyday situations,’ a spokesman for Fujitsu told MaiOnline

‘This can be used at a normal smartphone viewing distance, rather than within the 10cm range most existing iris recognition systems require.

‘And in safety testing, the infrared LED light was verified to be safe for the eyes.’

This also captures sweat pores and more on the tip of a finger
