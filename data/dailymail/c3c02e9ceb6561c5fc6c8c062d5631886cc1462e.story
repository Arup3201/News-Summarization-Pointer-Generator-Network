Floyd Mayweather said he's ready for whatever kind of brawl Marcos Maidana has waiting at the MGM Grand on September 13 as he worked out in front of the world's media in his Las Vegas gym.

The only thing separating the 11-time world champion and the Argentine's last encounter in May from a street fight was the ropes, but Mayweather's class came through as he took a points decision and extended his career record to 46-0.

A cut from a Maidana headbutt in the fourth round and a number of questionable blows from the underdog, a former world champ in his own right, didn't put Mayweather off his game and the richest sportsman on the planet is expecting more of the same when they meet again.

'I won. I don't have to adjust,' Mayweather said on his game plan for the rematch. 'But I expect the same dirty fighter I saw the first time. My job is to be cautious and be smart.'

Despite being the overwhelming favourite to dominate the rematch, Mayweather is still taking a siege mentality into the bout – although the amount of smiles and laughter as he worked up a sweat at Mayweather Boxing Club showed the relaxation one would expect from a boxer with a 46-0 record.

'I'm not just fighting the fighter. I'm fighting all the critics, all the biased fans. When you're at the top, people want to take shots at you,' Mayweather said. 

Maidana isn't the only target of Mayweather's ire – he's also hit back at rapper 50 Cent's recent $750,000 Harry Potter reading challenge.

'That's all he challenged me?' Mayweather responded when asked about the challenge by a fan. 'He gotta raise the stakes.'

He then had a stab at 50 Cent's own career: 'Does he still make music? I ain't heard him in a while.' 

Mayweather also has an eye on what could be the richest fights in boxing history with negotiations at an advanced stage for two 2015 clashes with Manny Pacquiao, finally bringing together the world's two best pound-for-pound fighters after years of near misses.

Sportsmail has reported the PacMan's promoter Bob Arum is confident the pair will meet with the added insentive of a double-your-money re-match a few months after the first encounter.

The purse for the first fight slated for May is said to be worth $300 million making the possible September re-match too rich for either camp to dodge.
