Three teenagers have been killed in a car crash that erupted into flames.

Joshua Rodriguez, 18, was driving 17-year-olds Sara Silvas and Zornitsa Petrova in rural Houston, Texas, on Wednesday afternoon when he lost control of his Honda sedan.

The vehicle slammed into a ditch and burst into flames.

Despite neighbors' desperate attempts to extinguish the blaze, all three Manvel High School students died on impact.

Tragic: Josh Rodriguez, 18, and his girlfriend Zori Petrova, 17, were killed after they crashed into a ditch

Victim: Their friend Sara Silva, 17, who was about to study medicine, was also killed on impact

Rodriguez, an athlete on the football and soccer teams, planned to study engineering at the University of Houston and was discussing applications with his brother the night before.

His girlfriend Petrova played tennis and swam competitively. The senior class president, she had accepted a place at Texas A&M University.

Silvas, their friend, was the daughter of a Manvel High School teacher. She played softball on the school's varsity team and was headed to San Antonio to attend UTSA and study medicine. 

The bodies were so badly burned it took hours to identify the victims, firefighters told KHOU. 

The trio had been driving along Old Chocolate Bayou Road in Brazoria County at 2pm when they crashed. 

Detectives are working to discern a cause for the incident. Initial reports suggest they were driving very fast.

The school's principal Charlotte Liptack paid tribute to each of the victims in a statement.

'Sara always had a bright smile and was a vibrant part of the Manvel High School community. She was kind, hardworking, and always helpful,' she said in a release read by KHOU.

Burned: The Honda sedan crashed backwards into the ditch and burst into flames, killing all three students

Rescue attempts: Despite neighbors' desperate attempts to extinguish the flames, they could not save them

Mourning: Students, teachers and relatives descended on the scene of the crash to pay their respects

Devastated: Their friends hugged and wept as they paid tribute to the three star seniors of Manvel High School

Of Rodriguez, the second eldest of four brothers, she said: 'He was an active student who was always happy and loved life. He was enthusiastic, vibrant and athletic.'

And Petrova 'had an outgoing, contagious personality. She was a brilliant student and an integral member of the debate and academic decathlon teams.' 

Families and friends gathered around a memorial at the scene of the crash to pay tribute on Thursday.

Nick Rodriguez, older brother of the driver, described Josh to the Houston Chronicle as 'tough but sweet' and 'the family peacemaker'.

'There wasn't a heart she didn't touch,' fellow senior Logan Grimes, 17, told the paper about Petrova, who was described as a prankster with boundless energy.

Sara, who transferred to Manvel in her junior year, had plans to study cancer and diagnostic sonography. 

'She was the bubbly, funny person you wanted to know,' her mother told the Chronicle.

The school sent a letter to student and families that read:

'Manvel High School is deeply saddened to share that a tragedy impacted our campus family yesterday afternoon. 

'Around 2 pm, three Manvel High School students were involved in a fatal car accident. Sadly, the Texas Department of Public Safety notified us this morning that seniors Sara Silvas, Joshua Rodriguez, and Zornitsa Petrova passed away at the scene of the accident.

'The Alvin ISD Crisis Response Team is currently on campus to provide assistance to both students and staff.
