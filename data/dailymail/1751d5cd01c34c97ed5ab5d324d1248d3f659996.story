Charged: Professor Green arrives at Lewisham Police Station in London to answer bail last night

Rapper Professor Green has been charged with drink driving over a crash outside his £1.5million home last year.

The Hackney-born hip hop artist, who is married to Quality Street heiress and Made in Chelsea star Millie Mackintosh, was charged last night under his real name, Stephen Manderson, after answering bail at a south London police station.

He had called police to his London home in November, claiming he had been mugged for his Rolex watch.

But when officers arrived in the early hours, they found that his £100,000 Mercedes had been involved in a crash with a van on the road outside.

No one was injured in the incident but police arrested the musician at the scene.

The 30-year-old was initially held on suspicion of drink-driving and spent a night in the cells.

Days later the rapper - who had a No1 hit in 2011 with Read All About It, which featured vocalist Emeli Sandé - was re-arrested on suspicion of attempting to pervert the course of justice in relation to the reported robbery. However, Scotland Yard said last night they were not pursuing this matter.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘Stephen Manderson has been charged with drink-driving following an incident on November 3 2013.

‘He will appear at Bromley Magistrates Court on March 20.’

Green was reported to have been clubbing prior to reporting the robbery to police at 2.40am on November 3.

He married Ms Mackintosh at Babington House, Somerset in September last year.

The couple met in 2011 after he saw the reality TV star on the cover of FHM magazine and asked his publicist to get her contact details.

Despite their disparate backgrounds, 
the rap artist who hails from a deprived council estate in East London 
and the privately educated heiress who grew up in a rural idyll 
immediately hit it off.

The 
24-year-old later quit her prominent role in Made In Chelsea when the 
programme makers demanded she play out her romance with Green on camera.

Earlier this year, Green said: ‘I know I couldn’t be with me - I’m an absolute nightmare.

Claims: The rapper arriving to answer bail last night. A second accusation of attempting to pervert the cause of justice is no longer being pursued by the Metropolitan Police, a spokesman said

‘So, I think Millie is commendable just for being with me and she’s helped me no end. I’m a huge pessimist - and too much pessimism can lead to depression.’

Since leaving Made In Chelsea, Ms Mackintosh has become a health, beauty and lifestyle blogger and is a brand ambassador for Claire’s, the High Street accessory and make-up chain.

She is preparing to launch her own clothes line and is due to take part in Celebrity Masterchef later this year.

A spokesman for Professor Green was unavailable for comment last night.

Different backgrounds: The wealthy heiress and the rapper who grew up with little have made a firm couple
