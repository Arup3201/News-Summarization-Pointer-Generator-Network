George Clooney's business partner Rande Gerber insists the two-time Oscar winner was not drunk and had not been downing tequila shots before he called Las Vegas hotel bigwig Steve Wynn an 'a**hole.'

Details of the verbal bust up, which occured two weeks ago at a restaurant inside Wynn's Encore hotel, emerged yesterday, and the 72-year-old billionaire claims Clooney had been drinking heavily before the name-calling began.

But Gerber, who owns Casamigos tequila with Clooney and is married to Cindy Crawford, was also there and denies Wynn's account, insisting 'We weren't drunk... no shots were had.'

The fight kicked off after Wynn, a verbal opponent to Obamacare, called President Barack Obama an 'a**hole.

'This wasn't about politics. It was about George standing up for a friend,' Gerber told TMZ.

Clooney confessed to calling Wynn an 'a**hole' back and then storming off after the insult.

The actor and Gerber were in Vegas promoting Casamigos tequila at a Wine & Spirits convention, and were invited to dine with Wynn and his wife, Andrea Hissom, at the fancy Botero restaurant.

But when dinner was finished, the conversation turned to Obama's Affordable Care Act, and that's when sparks began to fly.

Clooney immediately took exception to how the billionaire chairman and CEO spoke of his 'longtime friend.'

He allegedly declared that he didn't have to listen to 'this f***ing stuff' before exiting to another bar.

Wynn told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that Clooney likes his alcohol and 'got drunk' after drinking tequila shots.

'When he's drinking, he considers himself a close personal buddy of the president,' the said.

'Clooney's fun to be with when he's sober. If you have a chance to drink with him, you want to get there early, and don't stay late.

'Everybody who's in my business, the casino business, knows to take actors with a grain of salt.'

Wynn added Clooney's partners were 'mortified.'

However,
 in a statement sent to the newspaper, Clooney said: 'There were nine 
people at that table ... so you can ask them. ... Steve likes to go on 
rants.

'He
 called the president an a**hole ... that is a fact ... I said the 
President was my longtime friend and then he said "your friend is an 
a**hole."

'...At that point I told Steve that HE was an asshole and I wasn't going to sit at his table while he was being such a jackass.

'And I walked out. There were obviously quite a few more adjectives and adverbs used by both of us.

He added: 'It had nothing to do with politics and everything to do with character.'

Clooney and Gerber were joined by fellow business partner Michael Meldman, as well as a few others.
