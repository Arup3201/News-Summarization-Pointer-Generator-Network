For decades it had gathered dust in a box on top of a wardrobe among a war hero’s possessions.

But an entry within this tatty pocket diary appears to offer corroboration to claims that Adolf Hitler fathered an illegitimate son.

Yesterday one of former Royal Engineer Leonard Wilkes’s sons said the diary could offer the earliest written record of the story of Frenchman Jean-Marie Loret, who went to his grave believing Hitler was his father.

The sensational entry in Mr Wilkes' wartime diary which adds weight to the claims that Hitler fathered a son

Alan Wilkes came forward after reading
 about new information last month that adds weight to Mr Loret’s claim 
to have been conceived during a brief relationship between his mother 
and the then young German corporal during the First World War.

Leonard was one of the first soldiers to land on the Normandy beaches on D-Day in June 1944.

Over the following months he kept a 
diary as the Allies fought to liberate France and among the pages filled
 with neat writing in capital letters is a sensational reference to the 
alleged liaison between Hitler and Charlotte Lobjoie in the summer of 
1917.

On September 30 in 1944 Leonard, who 
was from Small Heath, Birmingham, wrote: ‘An interesting day today. 
Visited the house where Hitler stayed as a corporal in the last war, saw
 the woman who had a baby by him and she told us that the baby, a son, 
was now fighting in the French army against the Germans.’

The diary claims add weight to evidence that emerged last month that Jean-Marie Loret, right, was the lovechild of Adolf Hitler, left

Jean-Marie Loret, who was born in March, 1918, grew up knowing nothing about his father, apart from the fact that he was German.

It
 was only in the late 1950s, just before her death, that his mother, 
Charlotte Lobjoie, finally told him the story that was to haunt him for 
the rest of his life.

According to her story, the 
relationship began in 1917. Although Hitler, then 28, was fighting the 
French near Seboncourt, in the northern Picardy region, he made his way 
to Fournes-en-Weppe, a town west of Lille, for leave.

There
 he met Miss Lobjoie who apparently later told her son: 
‘One day I was cutting hay with other women, when we saw a German 
soldier on the other side of the street. He had a sketch pad and seemed 
to be drawing. All the women found this interesting, and were curious to
 know what he was drawing. I was designated to approach him.’

The
 pair started a brief relationship and  she said Jean-Marie was 
conceived after a ‘tipsy’ evening in June 1917. He was born the 
following year.

According to information from Mr Loret’s lawyer, Miss Lobjoie told her 
son: ‘When your father was around, which was very rarely, he liked to 
take me for walks in the countryside.

‘But
 these walks usually ended badly. In fact, your father, inspired by 
nature, launched into speeches which I did not really understand. He did
 not speak French, but solely ranted in German, talking to an imaginary 
audience.

‘Even if I spoke
 German I would not be able to follow him, as the histories of Prussia, 
Austria and Bavaria were not familiar to me at all, far from it. My 
reaction used to anger your father so much that I did not show any 
reaction.’

Three days later, his battalion 
marched on towards Brussels. He made no further reference to Miss 
Lobjoie or her lovechild and never mentioned it to his family on his 
return home from war.

Leonard was married to Doris for more 
than 50 years and worked as a machine presser. The grandfather of five 
and great-grandfather of 18 died in 1991, aged 76.

His son, from Ward End, Birmingham, 
said he discovered the diary with his brother, Gordon, 68, following the
 death of their mother ten years ago. Mr Wilkes, 73, said: ‘It was kept 
in a box. We were going to throw it out. I was shocked when I read it. 
My father never spoke to me about the war and, until he died. I never 
even knew the diary existed.’

The brothers did not think the diary 
would be of interest to anyone outside the family until new claims 
emerged in French magazine Le Point last month that Hitler may have had a
 son while serving as a soldier in France.

Mr Loret was born in March 1918 and his mother told him about his father shortly before her death in the late 1950s.

Mr Loret died in 1985, aged 67, having
 never been able to prove his heritage. But his lawyer, Francois 
Gibault, gave Le Point documents to support his claims.

The lawyer said Miss Lobjoie told her 
son the relationship with Hitler began in 1917 when the future Nazi 
leader was aged 28 and fighting the French in Picardy. The pair met when
 Hitler travelled to the town of Fournes-in-Weppe, near Lille, for 
leave. According to Mr Gibault, she later told her son: ‘One day I was 
cutting hay with other women, when we saw a German soldier on the other 
side of the street.

‘He had a sketch pad and seemed to be 
drawing. All the women found this interesting, and were curious to know 
what he was drawing. I was designated to approach him.’

The pair started a brief relationship 
and she said Jean-Marie was conceived after a ‘tipsy’ evening in June 
1917. He was born the following year.

Miss Lobjoie spoke to her son about 
his true heritage many years after she had given him up for adoption in 
the 1930s to a family called Loret. Mr Loret grew up to fight the 
Germans in 1939 and later joined the French Resistance.

Mr Loret later discovered that German 
officers brought envelopes of cash to Miss Lobjoie during the  Second 
World War. After she died, he found paintings in her attic which were 
signed by Hitler.
