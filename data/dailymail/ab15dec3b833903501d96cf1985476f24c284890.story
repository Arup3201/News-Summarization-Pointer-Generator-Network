It may have cost over £100 million to build, but Gerard Pique didn't appear too impressed as Barcelona arrived at St George's Park to begin their pre-season preparations.

The four-time European champions have chosen the National Football Centre to get ready for the new season and will be based in Burton-upon-Trent from July 28 - August 2 after flying into Birmingham on Monday.

However, Spain international Pique looked like he would rather be back at La Masia after posting a  sulky faced Instagram picture of his new digs, with the caption:'Views from my room. St George's Park'.
