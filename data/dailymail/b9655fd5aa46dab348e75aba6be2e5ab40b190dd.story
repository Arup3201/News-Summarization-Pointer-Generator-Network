A mysterious skeleton found buried inside a lead coffin beside the remains of Richard III could belong to a revered holy woman who was said to reduce time spent in purgatory for those that prayed for her soul.

Archaeologists believe the elderly woman, whose lead coffin was inlaid with a crucifix, may have been buried nearly 200 years before the last Plantagenet king of England.

Her coffin was discovered within a limestone sarcophagus under a car park in Leicester city centre on what was the site of the Grey Friars church, just feet from Richard III's grave.

The lead coffin, inlaid with a crucifix (top) was found just feet from the remains of Richard III. Inside was the skeleton of a woman who is thought to have died in her 60s about 200 years before the Plantagenet king

She was one of nine women found to have been buried within the medieval complex around the hastily dug final resting place of Richard III.

However, radiocarbon dating shows she may been buried not long after the church was first built 1250 - nearly two centuries before Richard III died.

The blow that killed King Richard III in battle was so powerful that it went up through the base of his brain and left an indentation on the inside of his skull, scientists studying his remains have revealed.

Forensic pathologists at University of Leicester, discovered two wounds at the base of the king's skull along with a large indentation inside the cranium.

The findings suggest that a weapon such as a sword or a spike had been thrust upwards through the base of the king's neck so hard that it had gone straight through his brain to the other side of his skull.

Genetic analysis of the battle scarred skeleton, discovered under a council car park in Leicester three years ago, has confirmed that it did belong to Richard III.

Scientists studying the remains believe the king was surrounded by a mob of enemy soldiers and hacked to death after he had lost his helmet.

Using modern medical scanners, they established that the English monarch suffered 11 devastating injuries at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. 

Analysis of isotopes preserved in her remains by researchers at the University of Leicester has shown that the woman was show that she had lived a privileged life, eating plenty of protein and large amounts of sea fish. It is thought that she had died in her 60s.

This suggests she had been wealthy and had been carefully buried in a prominent position under the choir of the friary and close to the high altar.

This all suggests she had special significant to the Catholic order and may have been an early benefactor of the friary, archaeologists leading the excavation believe.

They have found clues that suggest one of the women buried there was highly revered.

Records dating back to around the time the monastery was founded, more than 700 years ago, show that the Bishop of Lincoln offered a 30 day indulgence for anyone who would pray for a woman buried beneath a Franciscan Church in Leicester.

Dated to 1250, it offered a month off the pains of purgatory for anyone who would say 'a Pater and a Ave for the soul of Emma, wife of John of Holt, whose body is buried in the Franciscan church in Leicester'.

However, according to Mathew Morris, lead archaeologist at Leicester University and site director for the excavation, she is thought to be from Nevill Holt in Leicestershire.

However, little more is known about Emma Holt, and it was likely none of women found buried under Grey Friars will ever be completely identified.

He said: 'We don't know much more about her. We know she was buried around 1290 in the friary church, but we don't know her age at death, what she did for a living or what she looked like.

'We don't have any known descendants who can provide a DNA sample, so despite having a known woman buried here and a skeleton with a set of attributes we cannot link the two together.

'Unfortunately this skeleton will always remain anonymous.'

The twisted and battled scarred skeleton of Richard III was discovered in a shallow grave beneath the site of the friary in 2012.

Subsequent DNA work has positively confirmed the skeleton as belonging to the Plantagenet king. He had been buried in a crudely dug grave within the church in 1485.

Further excavations on the site in August 2013, however, revealed the sarcophagus containing the mystery elderly woman.

A further eight graves containing women were found around the spot where Richard III had been buried.

Scientists believe their could be at least seven more graves on the site of the old Grey Friars church, which was being used as a car park when archaeologists began excavating in their search for the body of Richard III

The sarcophagus was first uncovered in 2012 at the same time as Richard III but due to bad weather archaeologists had to wait until the following year before being able to return to begin excavating the coffin

Mr Morris said: 'What stands out more is the contrast between the care and attention taken with these burials – large, neatly dug graves with coffins – and the crudeness of Richard III’s grave.

'The more we examine it, the clearer it becomes how atypical Richard III’s burial really was.'

In total archaeologists exhumed three of the women found buried on the site of Grey Friars and left six undisturbed.

Two graves, inside the choir, contained wooden coffins with a woman inside each aged between 40 and 50 years old.

Radiocarbon dating shows that they probably died between 1270 and 1400, while osteological analysis of the bones show that one of the women had a congenital hip dislocation that would have forced her to walk with a crutch.

The other woman was found to have lived a life of hard physical labour, regularly using her arms and legs to life heavy weights.

The stonework of the sarcophagus had cracked and crumbled (shown above) due to the weight of the lid

Another skeleton, which had been disturbed and reburied in early building work, also showed signs of hard physical work and is believed to have died in her mid-20s.

However, it was the coffin found within the stone sarcophagus that has attracted most attention from archaeologists. It is the first to be found in Leicester in a modern excavation.

Mr Morris said: 'The stone sarcophagus was a tapered box carved from a single block of limestone. Inside, the wider end was curved, creating a broad head niche.

'Unfortunately, the stone lid did not properly fit the coffin allowing water to get inside, and its immense weight had badly cracked the sarcophagus, meaning it could not be lifted intact.

'However, inside the inner lead coffin was undamaged except for a hole at the foot end of the casket where the lead had decayed and collapsed inward exposing the skeleton’s feet.'

Initially the coffin was taken to Leicester Royal Infirmary to be examined for an endoscope in case any tissue had been preserved.

Mr Morris said that while the body had decayed to leave only a skeleton, fragments of cloth and hair were still intact.

He said: 'Opening a lead coffin was an interesting experience. It is a little like opening a tin can.

There were a few fragments of linen or cloth and cord - these might be the remains of the shroud. A little bit of hair survived as well.

'A grave like this you have go to think this person was important to the friars. We know this woman was over 60 when she died. Stable isotope analysis of her bones suggest she had a very high status diet and she was eating a lot of fish and meat.

'When you compare her diet with Richard III it is only just below his adult diet.'
