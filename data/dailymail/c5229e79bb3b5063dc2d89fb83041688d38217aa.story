A US based anti-vaccination campaigner, whose seminars were repeatedly boycotted by Australian doctors and venues, has announced the cancellation of her remaining talks due to consistent threats of violence from 'anti-free-speech terrorists'.

Sherri Tenpenny was due to speak at a number of events in Brisbane, Sydney, Adelaide, Melbourne and the Gold Coast, however a statement posted to one of her social media accounts on Wednesday, announced they had been cancelled. 

The reason cited was that a large number of violent threats, including bomb-threats, had been made against venue owners and their families.

'The determination was made to protect the speakers, the public and the venue owners as pro-vaccine extremists have made continual, anonymous threats of vandalism and violence,' the statement read.

U.S. anti-vaccination campaigner Sherri Tenpenny has cancelled a series of talks scheduled for Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, Gold Coast and Sydney following violent threats 

Australian ant-vaccine campaigner Stephanie Messenger, who had also planned to speak at the events, confirmed that she and Dr Tenpenny were concerned about the safety of the seminar attendees.

'Some people were planning to bring babies. The threats have been persistent. We are not able to insure that the attendees would be safe from harm,' Ms Messenger said.

Dr Tenpenny revealed that she had also cancelled a private holiday in Australia due to concerns for her own personal safety.

'I was coming to speak as an invited guest. However, given the level of hostility that has transpired over the last three weeks, and for the sake of my own personal safety, I have also cancelled my planned vacation in Australia,' she said.

The statement added: 'Additional options are being considered but not confirmed at this time. A refund will be issued for all tickets sold.'

 The osteopath physician, whose seminars claim vaccinations cause autism and other health problems, said that 'continual, anonymous threats of vandalism and violence' had been made against venue operators 

Police are understood to be investigating the violent threats, which they said may have actually been made by anti-vaccination activists, the ABC reports.

The cancellation comes just weeks after the general manager of Sydney's Kareela Golf and Social Club, Dennis Skinner, told the ABC that the club had cancelled Ms Tenpenny's event as they did not want to be tied to the contentious issue.

'The club as a venue, we don't have a position for or against this, we just decided the subject matter was too controversial for us to be involved in,' he said.

Ms Messenger responded at the time by saying people who were against the seminars were suppressing information.

'They say they want parents to make an informed choice, but you can't do that if you don't have all the information.' she said. 

Kareela Golf and Social Club (pictured above) was scheduled to hold one of Dr Tenpenny's seminars but they cancelled it earlier this month 

There are two change.org petitions currently still circulating in relation to Dr Tenpenny's now cancelled visit. 

One of them has come to the attention of the Immigration Minister Peter Dutton.

The Refuse Sherri Tenpenny's Visa into Australia petition asked the department to deny the campaigner a visa, citing she was 'a danger to Australian children and society as a whole due to her extremist and uneducated views regarding vaccination'.

So far, it has garnered over 7,000 signatures and a spokesman for Mr Dutton told the ABC he was 'taking advice on this matter and will make further comment when appropriate'.

The other petition was started by anti-vaccine group Stop the AVN called Do not allow Sherri Tenpenny to give her anti-vaccine talks in Australia.

People applauded the move from the club to shutdown the seminar, saying 'Thank you for making the ethical decision'

While others saw the cancellation as an attack on freedom of speech

It urged venues holding her seminars to cancel the events as she and other 'anti-vaccination extremists pose a severe threat to Australian society with their uneducated bogus claims'. 

Earlier this month, Dr Tenpenny defended her seminars after pro-immunisation parents labelled them 'disgusting'.

Dr Tenpenny said she found the backlash on social media 'curious'. 

'I planned to be in Australia for a holiday and was asked to speak with a few groups who are interested in discussing the pros and cons of vaccines,' she told Daily Mail Australia via email.

'It is curious why the public health, pro-vaccine community is so outraged over my visit and the opportunity to share information sourced from conventional medical journals. 

'If vaccines were so effective, so protective and so incredibly safe, no one would be interested in these gatherings.

It came just days after Dr Tenpenny defended the seminars after pro-immunisation parents labelled them as 'disgusting'

Doctors who were meant to hold a conference at Melbourne's Bayview Eden had also cancelled an event

Dr Tenpenny's arrival had people outraged and sparked an online campaign to stop her from speaking

'The public health community should be willing to openly discuss they problems associated with vaccines, how to improve vaccine safety, and how to restore the health of those who have been vaccine-injured.'  

On her website, Dr Tenpenny writes that she believes 'vaccines can cause more harm to the health of the individual' and is against 'a system that forces parents to inject their children, against their better judgment'.

Her views on immunisation are further demonstrated by the T-shirts sold on her site, which read: 'I didn't deny my children vaccines... I spared them' and 'Fact: 1 in 50 = Autism Overall, Fact: 1 in 25,000 = Unvaccinated, Prove Me Wrong'.

People took to social media to express their outrage, with one pro-vaccine group starting a letter writing campaign

The seminars were called Raising Healthy Children Naturally and Birth, Baby and Beyond

This comes after the Federal Court ruled against Homeopathy Plus, finding homeopathic vaccines were not scientifically proven to be effective, and said the health website had mislead people into thinking they could be used as a substitute for medical vaccines, News Corp reported. 

National Centre of Immunisaiton Research and Surveillance director Peter McIntyre told Daily Mail Australia Dr Tenpenny was tapping into people's 'fear factor'.

'When we've got no disease to see, it's very easy to look at something like autism - unfortunately it's something we still don't understand - and start to suggest it has something to do with being vaccinated. You can understand why people would believe that,' he said.

'But there are hundreds of studies that disprove that.'

Professor McIntyre added there was no scientific evidence homeopathic vaccinations protected people against infectious diseases.

He said it was like asking someone if they wanted to be vaccinated with 'sterile water'.

'It's just laughable really,' Professor McIntyre said.
