Steven Gerrard isn't getting the credit he deserves for his displays in a Liverpool shirt this season, believes former team-mate Jamie Carragher. 

The Liverpool captain revealed that he would be leaving his boyhood club at the end of the season to play in the MLS on New Year's Day.

Playing in his first game since that announcement, the 34-year-old scored both of the Reds' goals in their 2-1 FA Cup third round win at League Two side AFC Wimbledon on Monday night.

Gerrard's display at Kingsmeadow was another example of his influence at the club during his 17-year professional association with the Anfield outfit.

And after the match Sportsmail columnist Carragher took to Twitter to praise the midfielder's display - who is also the club's top goalscorer this season with nine goals.

He tweeted: 'Liverpool struggled for goals this season (and) their top scorer is going to MLS next season!!!!!!

'If Gerrard was one of the new signings at 24 we'd be raving about him, but we judge him at 34 against himself at his peak.'

The draw for the fourth round of the FA Cup sees Brendan Rodgers' team at home against Championship outfit Bolton Wanderers.

And although Liverpool have been drawn against lower league opposition once more, Gerrard says he is taking nothing for granted as he bids to win the trophy he has previously clinched twice in 2001 and 2006.

'I always enjoy the FA Cup,' he told BBC One in his post-match interview.

'I grew up loving the competition and as it's going to be my last time, I want to make the most of it and try and go all the way.

'If I weren't here playing for this team, I'd probably be in the stands watching it so I know what (the FA Cup) means to every single supporter, that's why I always try to give my best.

'We've got to take each game as it comes. I'm told we've got Bolton at home in the next round and that'll be another difficult test.

'I know Neil Lennon quite well and I know he'll set up his team to be very difficult to beat.

'We take each game as it comes but of course, (winning the cup is) what dreams are made of and hopefully that'll be the case.'
