Guests are promised ‘unforgettable days and pleasant surprises’ in a four-star hotel combining ‘impressive luxury and elegance.’

But for more than 400 British holidaymakers, staying at the Royal Park Hotel in the Bulgarian resort of Elenite was a nightmare.

Dirty conditions and appalling food hygiene proved a dangerous combination, with numerous families suffering illness and being struck down by a vomiting bug.

Compensation: First Choice yesterday paid out £500,000 to be shared by 281 customers who stayed at the Royal Park Hotel in Bulgaria

Yesterday 281 holidaymakers who stayed at the hotel four years ago won a settlement of more than £500,000 from tour operator First Choice after suing the holiday company.

It follows an earlier £200,000 payment to nearly 100 holidaymakers who suffered a similar fate when they stayed between 2004 and 2007 through the same holiday firm.

Many of the unlucky tourists were so badly hit with gastric illness they continue to suffer from symptoms four years later.

Guests at the ‘hotel from hell’ complained of flies buzzing around the food, inadequately cooked chicken, dirty crockery and cutlery in the restaurant, rude staff and unhelpful tour reps.

Out of almost 300 people to receive the latest compensation payout more than 30 were so ill they required hospital treatment.

Despite the same complaints being repeated month after month and year after year, nothing was apparently done to improve conditions.

A number of the families had booked trips for   occasions such as wedding anniversaries and honeymoons.

First Choice denied responsibility for the guests’ sickness but agreed the six-figure settlement shortly before a trial date was due to be fixed. The 281 guests all stayed at the Royal Park between June and October 2008.

First Choice refused to comment yesterday.
