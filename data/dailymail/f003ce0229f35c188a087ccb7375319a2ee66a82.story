Schoolchildren are prostituting themselves in one in seven Italian high schools, a new survey has found.

Students as young as 14 are selling their bodies to classmates on a regular basis at nine per cent of schools in Italy.

Meanwhile, isolated incidents of child prostitution have occurred at a further five-and-a-half per cent of institutions.

Shocking: Schoolchildren are prostituting themselves in one in seven Italian high schools (posed by models)

The shocking statistics were revealed in an online poll by student website Skuola.net.

About 3,000 Italian schoolchildren took part in the survey - with students in a staggering 14 per cent of schools admitting to prostituting themselves. 

Nearly 40 per cent of students claimed prostitution didn't occur at their school - while 46.5 per cent said they didn't know whether it happened, according to The Local.

Alarmingly, of those who knew about child prostitution, a quarter admitted to having numerous sexual encounters with female students in exchange for money.

A further five per cent confessed to having a single encounter with a child prostitute.

And almost nine per cent of schoolchildren said that, although they hadn’t yet paid for a prostitute, they would like to.

Italy is not the only country where child prostitution has become an issue in recent years.

In Indonesia, children as young as 11 are being sold for sex by teenagers barely older than themselves.

Last month, the National 
Commission for Child Protection said 21 girls aged between 14 and 16 had 
been caught working as 'mamis' in the country so far this year.

Many had been drawn into child prostitution by the lure of money or drug addiction.

And today, MailOnline revealed that underage girls are sold for sex every ten miles along Brazil's BR-116 highway - often for as little as £8.
