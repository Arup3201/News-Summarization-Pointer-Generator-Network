Louis van Gaal is unlikely to get too giddy over the fact that the Guinness International Cup will sit proudly alongside the Chevrolet Cup at Old Trafford this season. The Dutchman is too long in the tooth to pay much attention to pre-season tournaments and the pots they provide.

Of far more importance to Van Gaal will be the way his team fought back in Miami’s Sun Life Stadium to claim an unlikely, and some would argue undeserved, victory over old rivals Liverpool.

It means that United fly home on Tuesday morning unbeaten on their five-game tour of America and yet to taste defeat under the new manager. No mean feat when the opponents have also included Real Madrid, Roma and Inter Milan.

That scenario appeared unlikely when a
 Liverpool side who were on top for two thirds of the game went ahead 
through Steven Gerrard’s penalty. However, two goals in three minutes 
from Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata turned the game on its head before 
substitute Jesse Lingard added a late third.

Perhaps more significantly, he was handed the captain’s
role that he craves at United for the first time under the new regime.

Victory
 will not paper over the cracks for Van Gaal. United were poor at times 
here and he will be concerned at how his 3-4-1-2 formation was exposed 
by the excellent Raheem Sterling in a game that was every bit as 
competitive as we had hoped.

A
 thunderstorm of almost Biblical proportions on Sunday night and more 
torrential downpours throughout Monday may have been to blame for a 
disappointing turnout which was well below expectations. David Beckham, 
for one, must hope that was the reason and not an abject lack of 
interest for soccer in South Florida as he prepares to pump millions 
into a new franchise in Miami.

The
 weather would have left many pitches under water but the surface was in
 remarkably good condition at kick-off, such is the quality of the 
drainage system here. They still don’t have a roof on the Sun Life 
Stadium, though, which is just too bad for spectators.

This,
 remember, is the same venue where England’s World Cup warm-up against 
Honduras was held up for 20 minutes last month because of thunderstorms 
and lightning; and the same stadium where Sterling and Valencia were 
sent off for an ugly confrontation when Roy Hodgson’s side had met 
Ecuador met three days earlier.

Any
 chance of another ding-dong between the two disappeared inside eight 
minutes as Valencia went off injured – curiously he had been omitted 
from the line-ups broadcast on TV beforehand – and replaced by Luke 
Shaw.

The change also meant 
that Ashley Young switched from left to right. As well as he has played 
on tour, Young does not offer the same defensive protection as Valencia 
and United discovered that to their cost five minutes later.

Can't believe it: Rooney walked off with an embarrassed look on his face after the 'goal'

Out: The ball clearly hits the stanchion before bouncing out towards Rooney to slot home

Sterling
 had already caused them enough problems down the left flank when he 
pushed the ball past Phil Jones inside the penalty box. Jones is not the
 quickest of centre-backs, nor can he always resist the temptation to 
dive in, and on this occasion it cost his team a penalty.

The
 way he and his teammates protested showed just how much this game meant
 to them, but it was the right decision by referee Mark Geiger even 
though Jones got the slightest of touches. After that, there was never 
any doubt Gerrard would beat David De Gea from the spot.

In
 fact, Liverpool should have had another penalty in the 34th minute when
 Jones’s poor pass played Chris Smalling into trouble. Rickie Lambert 
laid the ball to Sterling and the fact that Ander Herrera clearly fouled
 him with his second attempt to tackle the winger was somehow missed by 
the match officials.

United’s
 best chance in the first half arrived as early as the fifth minute when
 Javier Hernandez slid in to turn Young’s outswinging pass back across 
goal and Mamadou Sakho’s last-ditch clearance denied Rooney an almost 
certain goal.

Liverpool had 
the best of it, though, and Jordan Henderson headed over from a great 
position when Hernandez could only help Gerrard’s freekick into his path
 before Phillipe Coutinho brought a fantastic save from De Gea down by 
his near post.

They continued to threaten after half-time and could have scored another two within five minutes of the restart.

This
 time it was Herrera’s turn to put Mata under pressure with a poor pass.
 He was easily dispossessed and Gerrard squared the ball to Lambert 
whose finish from 10 yards lacked conviction.

Moments
 later, Coutinho again exposed Jones with a pass in behind the United 
defender and Sterling cut inside only to see his effort deflect wide off
 the heels of Smalling.

So you could understand the sense of shock when United suddenly struck back with two goals in three minutes.

It
 was difficult to tell which was better, Hernandez’s cross or Rooney’s 
finish, when they got the first. The Mexican picked out his teammate’s 
run with a quite wonderful ball to the back post. There was still plenty
 of work to do from a tight angle with Martin Skrtel in close 
attendance, but Rooney watched the ball all the way before guiding it 
back across Simon Mignolet and inside the far post with his left foot.

Pivot: United midfielder Ashley Young turns away from the attention of Glen Johnson

If
 Liverpool could feel slightly aggrieved at being pegged back, they were
 positively shocked to fall behind to Mata’s strike moments later.

There
 seemed little danger when Shaw played the ball into the Spaniard 20 
yards from goal but Mata took advantage of poor marking to turn and 
shoot. Sakho spotted the danger too late and only succeeded in applying a
 vital nick which left his goalkeeper wrong-footed.

United
 thought they had grabbed a bizarre third in the 65th minute when 
Young’s booming effort from the left touchline had Mignolet backtracking
 towards his own goal.

In fact, the Belgian keeper was in the 
side-netting by the time it landed inches over the bar but then 
rebounded back off the frame of the goal.

Ever
 the predator, Rooney was lurking to guide home the loose ball but the 
furtive glance and wry smile gave something away long before the error 
was spotted on television and the goal chalked off.

There
 was nothing wrong with Lingard’s effort in the 88th minute though. 
Again Young was involved, racing down the right and crossing into the 
Liverpool box. Shinji Kagawa miscontrolled but it only teed the ball up 
for Lingard who took one touch before rifling a shot past Mignolet.

No doubt the scoreline flattered United. But Van Gaal has been brought in to win, and so far that is all he has done.
