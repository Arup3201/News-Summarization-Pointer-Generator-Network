Fiorentina manager Vincenzo Montella has praised the impact of Mohamed Salah since arriving from Chelsea and believes only Barcelona star Lionel Messi is faster on the ball.

Salah joined the Viola on loan in February as part of the deal for Juan Cuadrado to head to West London for £23.3m, rising to £27m, and Montella believes his side have currently got the better deal.

The Egyptian forward was in fine form as Fiorentina defeated Serie A rivals Roma 3-0 at the Stadio Olimpico to reach the Europa League quarter-finals.

The 22-year-old has been in spectacular form since arriving in Italy, having only featured eight times for Jose Mourinho's side this season, scoring six goals from 10 appearances.

Fiorentina can make Salah a permanent signing this summer and Montella admitted his surprise at the Egyptian's instant impact.

'Maybe right now we have got the better deal,' he told Mediaset Premium, when referring to the money-plus Salah deal for Cuadrado. 

'For now, we have benefited. We knew the superb characteristics of the player, but we did not expect him to have such an impact on Italian football. Perhaps only Messi is faster than him with the ball at one's feet.'

Fiorentina have a genuine chance of playing in the Champions League next season, sitting just four points off Lazio in the third qualifying spot in Serie A.

'This success is deserved, my team have grown a lot in terms of mentality,' added Montella. 

'The team's proven to have a great desire to win. We endured a terrible run of form earlier this season, but we got through it; there might be another like that, though we will fight to achieve our goals. 

'All victories require a small dose of luck, even though one makes their own luck to win.'
