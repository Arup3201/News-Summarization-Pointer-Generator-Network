Bounding into the world weighing as little as 10lb, there are human babies that have been heavier than Winnie the pygmy hippo calf.

She was born at Bristol Zoo Gardens three weeks ago and has since enjoyed romping around her enclosure with her father Nato and mother Sirana - who is ferociously protective.

There are fewer than 2,000 of the rare beasts in the wild and when they are born, their mothers keep them concealed in thick vegetation and visit to breastfeed.

Water baby: Winnie the pygmy hippo, left with her mother Sirana (also pictured right), has been born in captivity at Bristol Zoo Gardens and has spent three weeks romping around her enclosure - which includes a heated swimming pool. Just 2,000 of the beasts are left in the wild with their west African habitat facing destruction

Miniscule: The tiny hippo barely measures up to the bottom of the metal gate she is walking through, and weighs as little as some human babies

Glurgh! Once fully-grown Winnie will spend much of her life in the water, but for now it looks the heated pool in her enclosure will take some getting used to. Pygmy hippo mothers are extremely protective of their calves, and in the wild they keep them hidden in thick undergrowth where they visit periodically to nurse them to full growth

Mum's the word: The tiny hippo calves are almost completely helpless for the first three weeks of their lives and can only eat vegetation after three months

A leaf out of mum's book: Winnie weighs between 10lb and 14lb. Early explorers thought pygmy hippos were sweating blood because glands emit a clear reddish fluid

At Bristol Winnie has the luxury of a heated pool, a plentiful supply of food and no predators, but her mother is still keeping a watchful eye.

Lynsey Bugg, assistant curator of mammals at the zoo, said Sirana is proving 'very maternal' with her newborn.

'Winnie follows Sirana a lot,' she added. 'Sirana is very protective and doesn't let her stay in deep water for too long.

'Young hippos tire easily and Sirana will quite often guide her baby into shallow water or bring her out of the pool.

'Winnie is doing brilliantly, she's putting on weight really well, she is starting to get a bit chunky.Â

Gone swimming: Winnie tests the water, right, with her mother. Once fully grown pygmy hippos can close their ears and eyes underwater, where they spend long periods

Conservation: Bristol Zoo Gardens is one of several zoos across the continent taking part in a captive breeding regime by the European Endangered Species Programme

Dwarfed: While Winnie's mother Sirana weighs up to 275kg (43st), that is still only a tenth the weight of the more widespread common hippopotamus

Pygmy hippos are hard to study as they are secretive, live in dense forest and females usually breed only once every two years.

They ovulate for two to three days a month, similarly to humans, and call to males and leave pens messy when they are in the mood.

Calves are born after six months and are helpless at first, unable to walk far or eat vegetation for three months.

Pygmies are much smaller than the common hippo, from whom they split off as as separate species several million years ago.

They have proportionally longer legs, a smaller head, less prominent eyes and 
ears more towards the side of the head. The nose and ears can be closed underwater.

Early explorers thought the animals were sweating blood because glands emit clear reddish fluid to keep their skin moist.

In captivity pygmies live for about 30 years, breeding for themselves after five.

'I think people are quite surprised when they see how small she is because mum and dad are quite big.'

While WInnie weighs between 4.5kg (10lb) and 6.2kg (1st) now, she will grow in adulthood to be as heavy as 275kg (43st).

That pales in insignificance to the size of the more widespread common hippo, however, which are the third-heaviest land mammals on earth.

Fully-grown adults reach between one and a half tonnes (236st) and three tonnes (472st).

Bristol Zoo Gardens is part of an international breeding programme for the tiny hippos, which also includes zoos such as Edinburgh and Whipsnade, as fewer than 2,000 of them are thought to exist naturally in the wild.

It is impossible to know how many are still alive because their habitats in west Africa, which includes Liberia, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone and Guinea, have been blighted by unrest and big business.

Deforestation of the area around the Sapo National Park in Liberia, carried out by logging companies, is threatening one of the pygmy hippo's last known strongholds.

Scientists have been using camera traps - live video feeds disguised in rocks, vegetation or trees - to monitor the patterns of how the naturally reclusive animals move through the dense forest.

The captive breeding regime is taking place under the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP), with participating zoos across the continent.

Nato and Sirana will have completed a long wait for a baby - as they are the only pygmy hippos currently living at the zoo, and females only breed in the wild once every two years.

Ms Bugg said: 'The European programme is a 
well-established and very successful programme and our male, Nato, is a 
genetically important animal; by default, so will be his offspring.'

'Mum... I think someone's here to see us': Visitors will soon be able to flock to the pygmy hippo exhibit to see Winnie enjoying her heated bathing pool

Too cute for words: Female pygmy hippos breed only every two or so years, though they are similar to humans - they become fertile for two or three days every month and pregnancies last for six months. Like humans and unlike other African wildlife such as buck, pygmy hippo calves are more or less helpless for the first stages of their life
