British boxer Amir Khan has visited the survivors of the deadly terrorist attack on a school in northwestern Pakistan earlier this month. 

Khan, who is of Pakistani descent, met with two injured students at the Combined Military Hospital in Peshawar during his visit to the country in support of the victims.

Nearly 150 people died when seven members of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan(TTP) stormed the Army Public School in Peshawar on December 16, with 132 of them were children.

Khan met with eighth-grader Junaid, who was shot by the Taliban insurgents and hospitalised with bullet wounds in his legs.

The 28-year-old from Bolton, Greater Manchester, asked Junaid what he would like to be when he grows up, to which the boy replied that he wanted to 'become a man like Khan who has fame all over the world'.

Khan also visited the home of the relatives of student Baqir Ali, who was killed in the terrorist attack on the Army Public school.  

Talking to his family members Khan said, 'I was deeply shocked when I received the information about an attack at school in Pakistan. That was a hard day of my life and I could not explain the pain of those moments.

'I am still deeply shocked. I know the pain families are feeling at this moment. I know this is a brave nation and will bear such a big loss with a big heart. And I know the terrorists will not let go.'

Earlier today, Khan, whose family hails from Punjab, spoke of his pain when seeing grieving parents in front of the photographs of the victims, and urged the survivors of the attack to return to school.

'I really feel distressed over the bloody terror attack in which we lost such beautiful children whose only "crime" was to go to school,' he said.

'Killing innocent children is something one cannot explain in words.

'It is really very painful to see parents looking at pictures of their martyred children outside the school building.'

The attack on December 16 saw Taliban gunmen stormed the military-run school where they held 500 people hostage before killing 148 people, including 132 children.

In support of the rehabilitation of the school and the surviving students, Khan has donated the £30,000 shorts he wore against Devon Alexander to help raise money.

'Pakistan needs to begin the immediate rehabilitation of the students who witnessed those horrible scenes. We need to ensure that the students who survived the attack can move forward and look towards future.

'I really wish that the children who are studying at the Army Public School, and other schools in the province, carry on their studies as they are the future of this country.

'We need them to build a stronger Pakistan that can bring something good to this world, instead of terrorists.

'The only way you can eradicate terrorism is to make sure your children and your whole society is educated enough to understand the problem and stand against terrorists.'

Khan travelled to Pakistan last week, and has stressed that it was 'more important than ever' for him to travel to the country.

'Talking about this stuff could be threatening for me, but I just want to speak the truth and tell people what is happening is wrong,' he said during a press conference in Islamabad last week.

'I think it's more important now than ever to go over there. I think it will send a statement to a lot of people that Amir Khan is going there to make a difference.

'I want it to be a better country. It's just a shame - I cannot believe how sick some people are.' 

During his trip, Khan announced that he would be building a boxing academy in the eastern city of Lahore.
