Families can look forward to a bargain Christmas with prices falling at their fastest rate in 12 years.

Black Friday and a raft of offers drove retail prices down by 2 per cent in November compared with a year ago, triggering the biggest rise in sales in a decade.

At the same time, supermarkets are in the grip of a price war and food bills have fallen by 1 per cent.

Retail prices were down by 2 per cent in November compared with a year ago, triggering the biggest rise in sales in a decade 

Stores are slashing prices to get customers through the doors and grab a share of an estimated £5billion that is expected to be spent between now and Christmas Day.

Promotions are being ramped up at major department stores, such as House of Fraser and Debenhams, plus the likes of Gap, H&M, Argos and Marks & Spencer.

John Lewis has been dragged into the fray because it has to match rival department store prices under its ‘Never Knowingly Undersold’ promise.

As families prepare for the biggest shopping weekend of the year, it seems the cost of a turkey dinner and presents for the family will be lower than in 2013.

The growth in retail sales hit a ten-year high in November, largely driven by special offers around Black Friday and Christmas, according to the Office of National Statistics.

The number of items going through tills in the High Street and online rose by 6.4 per cent on the same month last year, which is the biggest increase since 2004.

Heavy price cutting fuelled a 15.4 per cent rise in sales through department stores in the month, while sales of electrical goods were up 32 per cent on a year ago.

The net result was that despite significant price cuts, shoppers spent an average of £400million a week more in November than last year, taking the total up to almost £32billion.

The figures were much stronger than expected by analysts, who said the rise was largely down to promotions ahead of Christmas.

At the same time, wage rises are now beginning to outpace inflation with the result families feel a little better off and confident about their finances.

Economist Sam Alderson, of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: ‘The falling cost of essential items such as fuel and food has brightened the economic environment facing UK households in recent months and freed up income for families to enjoy over the holiday season.’

The ONS said: ‘Average store prices fell by 2 per cent in November 2014 compared with November 2013, this was the largest fall since August 2002. The largest contribution to the year-on-year fall once again came from petrol stations, however, prices in food stores showed their largest fall since June 2002, decreasing by 1 per cent.’

The head of retail at accountants Deloitte, Ian Geddes, said price cuts and promotions in November drove the spending binge.

‘This year most of the boost provided by the biggest ever Black Friday has been felt in November, and this is reflected in month-on-month volume growth and strong year-on-year increase online,’ he said.

‘The extent to which sales have been promotionally driven is highlighted by the steepest decline in store prices for 12 years.’

Economist Alasdair Cavalla said: ‘Continuing price falls, rising real wages and the Black Friday “retail holiday” combined to push the figure to its highest annual growth rate since May 2004.

‘Growing sales volumes were supported by average price falls in stores of 2 per cent.

‘Price discounts at large retailers boosted sales at department stores by 15.5 per cent and household goods stores by 16.8 per cent year-on-year. The volume of electrical household appliances sold rose at the highest annual rate since records began, gaining 32 per cent on the year.

‘Falling oil and commodity prices are certainly helping consumers to keep spending.’

Some analysts suggested families brought forward their Christmas shopping to November because of Black Friday. If that is the case, it seems stores will have to step up price cuts in the coming days to shift stock.

Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to forecasting group the EY ITEM Club, said: ‘November’s Black Friday proved a boon for retailers ahead of the Christmas period with retail sales growing at their fastest rate for over ten years. Electrical goods in particular saw a storming performance.

‘However, November’s spending splurge could presage a disappointing Christmas period for retailers. Black Friday and other temporary factors will have brought forward some sales activity so a sharp reversal in sales growth in December seems likely.

‘That said, there is reason for optimism looking forward. The fundamental drivers of consumer spending are looking more solid and growth in earnings may finally be starting to pick-up.’

The ONS said sales through web stores in November were an average of £753.4million a week, which was up by 12.9 per cent on the same month last year.

Figures published earlier this week suggest online spending for 2014 is likely to burst through the £100billion barrier for the first time.

A household income tracker published by Asda today suggests families have £11 more per week to spend on festive treats for family and friends than they did the same time last year.

The study pointed out that wages are now growing at 1.6 per cent a year, which is above the official inflation rate of 1 per cent. It said people typically have £179 per week in their pockets, after taxes had been deducted and bills paid for.

Retail expert Fraser McKevitt, of Kantar World Panel, believes food price falls are likely to continue into 2015 as the price war rumbles on.
