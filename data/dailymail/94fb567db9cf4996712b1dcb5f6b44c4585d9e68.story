The Labour leader is expected to lambast the retailer over zero-hours contracts 

Ed Miliband will today accuse a major high street firm of ‘Victorian management practices’ for using zero-hours contracts for eight in ten of its staff.

The Labour leader will lambast Sports Direct for employing so many of its 20,000-strong workforce on the contracts, despite many of them working regular shifts.

He will pledge to ban the contracts if he wins the next election, giving employees the legal right to a regular contract if they work regular hours.

But last night Tories accused Mr Miliband of hypocrisy, as several Labour-run councils employ zero-hours staff.

Doncaster Council, the authority in Mr Miliband’s constituency, has admitted it employs 300 people on the contracts.

Freedom of Information inquiries show that in 2013, Derby Council employed 1,333 people on the contracts, Gateshead 1,285 and Bury 3,418. All are run by Labour.

It came as a poll of business leaders found just 14 per cent trust Mr Miliband and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls on the economy. Nearly six in ten prefer David Cameron and George Osborne.

The YouGov survey, commissioned by the Conservatives, also found six in ten thought the Tories would deliver a ‘strong and healthy economy for Britain’ compared with just 12 per cent for Ukip. 

Sports Direct is owned by billionaire businessman Mike Ashley, who also owns Newcastle United Football Club. Mr Miliband will accuse the firm of being a ‘bad place to work’.

‘Sports Direct has predictable turnover, it is a modern company with stores on many high streets and, judging by its success, where many people shop,’ he will say.

‘But for too many of its employees, Sports Direct is a bad place to work. This is not about exceptional use of zero-hours contracts for short-term or seasonal work … This is the way Sports Direct employs the vast majority of its workforce.

Many of the company's 20,000 strong workforce are on zero-hours contracts despite working regular shifts 

‘These Victorian practices have no place in the 21st century.’

Mr Miliband is expected to say it is unfair that around 1.4million workers are on zero-hours contracts while some at the top appear to pay no tax at all.

But Tory business minister Matthew Hancock said: ‘Another rehashed policy from Ed Miliband can’t hide the fact that he still hasn’t got an economic plan … We’re already tackling the abuse of zero-hours contracts – after 13 years of Labour doing absolutely nothing about it.’

No one at Sports Direct was available for comment.
