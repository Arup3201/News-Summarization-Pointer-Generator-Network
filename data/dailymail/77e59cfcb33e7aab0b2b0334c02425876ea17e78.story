Michael Phelps, who has won an astonishing two golds and two silvers in five races during the London Olympics, is prepping for his second-to-last race tomorrow.

The Bullet of Baltimore will swim the 100-meter butterfly on Friday, with a chance to add a second threepeat to his resume, and the 4x100 meter relay Saturday before taking off his suit, cap, and goggles for the last time.

He won his first individual gold in London in the 200 individual medley on Thursday, making him the first man to win the same individual event at three consecutive Olympics.

'He didn't have it on his goal sheet,
 but for me that was important,' Phelps' coach Bob Bowman said. 'I 
always wanted him to do three just because that was cool.'

Phelps can do it again in the 100 
fly, going into the final with the fastest time of 50.86 seconds. He has
 no special strategy for the two-lap sprint. 'It's the 100,' he 
explained to the AP. 'You just kind of go for it and hopefully hang on.'

Phelps' fourth and final Olympics started out with a loss to rival Ryan Lochte in the 400 IM.

The decorated swimmer has been more 
forthcoming as retirement draws closer. His emotions are closer to the 
surface, too, with tears welling in his eyes on the medals podium.

'Going into the relay, it'll probably kick into my head more and more,' he said.

In the last clash of the swimming 
titans in London yesterday, Phelps showed why he's the greatest Olympian
 of all time as he boosted his medal count to 20 in his final race 
against rival Ryan Lochte.

The 27-year-old Phelps picked up gold
 in the 200m individual medley, as Lochte, his friend and closest rival 
came in right behind him.

The Olympic swimming sensation has made no secret about the fact that he plans to retire after the London games.

The win - his first individual gold 
medal in London - was a historic trifecta for Phelps, who is now the 
only male athlete to win the same event in three-straight Olympics.

He led the field from beginning to 
end, and touched the wall first in a time of one minute, 54.27 seconds, 
just outside Lochte's world record of 1:54.00 that he set last year in 
the final at the Shanghai world championships.

Lochte,
 close to exhaustion after winning bronze in the 200 backstroke, held on
 to finish second, just 0.63 behind his teammate.

Phelps had only kind words for his compatriot.

'Ryan
 has probably been one of the toughest competitors I've swam against, 
all-around competitors,' Phelps said of Lochte. 'We're seeing a lot more
 competitors coming up.'

Posting on Twitter after the dramatic swim, Lochte said: 'Hell of a race with @TylerClary and @MichaelPhelps.'

The race also pushed the American medal count up to 37, three above China in overall Olympic hardware.

Rumours swirled today that Phelps may be heading to a career in television after the London games.

Though
 Phelps hasn't divulged post-retirement plans, America's top TV networks
 are reportedly falling over themselves hoping to land Teams USA's 
golden boy as a sports commentator.

TMZ reports
 that NBC, ESPN and ABC are preparing to capture Phelps as a future 
Olympics commentator with huge contracts that could be worth millions - 
in a possible bidding war.

While the networks try to woo Phelps 
with dollar signs, there was only one thing on the swimming champ's 
mind: His final race today with rival Lochte.

Their
 first showdown of the London Olympics went to Lochte in a runaway on 
the opening night of the swimming competition. This one was much closer.

'We love racing against each other,' Phelps said before the race. 'Neither one of us likes to lose. I like to say we bring out the best in one another.'

Calling it quits: Phelps has said that he plans to retire at the end of the London Olympics

Hungary's Laszlo Cseh, who touched the wall after Lochte and picking up the bronze medal in a time of 1:56.22.

Cseh been the perennial also-ran in the last two Olympics, taking bronze behind Phelps at the 2004 Athens Games and silver four years ago in Beijing when Phelps won and Lochte was third.

Lochte had a busy schedule on another
 big day for American swimmers, winning a bronze medal in the 200m 
backstroke final - about a half hour before the 'duel in the pool' 
against Phelps.Â 

Though friends, the two have sparked a rivalry in the water, with many Americans split on who to root for.

But Phelps appeared to have one backer that Lochte does not - the leader of the free world.

Phelps, still reeling from the previous day's tweet, described the call as 'pretty cool'.

'I answered the phone and the voice said "Michael?" "Yes." "Please hold for the President of the United States,"' he told reporters today, after qualifying for the 100-meter butterfly semi-final.

'I was like, "wow."' The president, he said, told Phelps the country was supporting him and proud of his performance. The conversation took an awkward turn when the president said: 'Make sure you tell your mom I said hi'.'
