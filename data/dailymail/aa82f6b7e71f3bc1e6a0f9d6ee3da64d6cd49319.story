The longterm girlfriend of Steven Ercolino, the victim in last week's Empire State Building shooting, talked at length about her slain ‘soulmate’.

'When we were together, we weren’t two adults. We were big kids,' Ivette Rivera, 38, said at the funeral on Wednesday.

The emotional service was held Our Lady of Sorrows church in White Plains, New York just five days after he was shot by a disgruntled former employee outside of the busy tourist destination.

Support: Ms Rivera spoke at the service, but the eulogy was given by Ercolino's sister

'He saved me. I saved him,' Ms Rivera said at the service, though she didn't specify in what ways they helped one another.

The New York Daily News reports that Ms Rivera, who began dating Mr Ercolino eight years ago after being set up by her mother, had to stop because of tears several times during her speech.

The couple moved in together four years ago and while they had put off marriage- assuming they had more time together- Ms Rivera was thought of as a accepted member of the family.

'You fulfilled him. You were his soulmate,' Mr Ercolino's sister Mary Rashford said of Ms Rivera.

'He referred to you guys as the Evie and Stevie show.'

Mr Ercolino, 41, and shooter Jeffrey Johnson previously worked together at Hazan Import Corp before Johnson was fired over a year ago.

Johnson appeared to blame Mr Ercolino
for his economic troubles and purposefully tracked him down when he 
fatally shot him last Friday. Johnson was shot on the scene by police 
officers.

In the wake of the shooting, a group 
photo from a company gathering shows both Mr Ercolino and Johnson, 
proving that they were acquaintances well before the shooting.

Predictably, Wednesday's funeral 
focused on Mr Ercolino's warm heart and generous personality, with his 
sister talking at length about how much her brother cared for their 
family.

An avid sports fan, whose casket was 
adorned with a flower arrangement in the shape of the Mets' logo, his 
last correspondence with his father was a teasing text about an upcoming
Jets game.

He recently spoke to his mother, who 
is ailing from lung surgery, and told his sister how lucky they were to 
have such caring parents.

'He was the epitome of how a son 
should treat and respect a mother. He was my dad’s best friend,' Ms 
Rashford said according to The New York Post.

Though
he was not a father himself, he continued that tradition with his 
nieces and nephews, who he toured around the city and hosted for 
sleepovers.

Mr Ercolino's two brothers, Peter and Paul, did not speak at the service but stood beside their sister during her eulogy.

'We
will forever be chipped away at and left with a hole, but we are not 
broken. We will honor his life by living as he did: with laughter and 
with love,' she said.
