Swimmers at a gala in Hubei province, in central China were pictured dodging the corpse of a drowned citizen while taking part in a rain-drenched event in the swollen Yangtze river.

The event took place as tens of thousands of residents in the ancient town of Fenghuang, in neighbouring Hunan province, were forced to flee their homes.

There, stunning buildings and bridges dating back hundreds of years to the Qing and Ming-dynasties are under water after the Tuojiang river burst its banks following days of heavy rain.

Deadly: A total of 2,561 swimmers taking part in an annual event in neighbouring Hubei province were forced to dodge a corpse floating in the Yangtze River (pictured right)

Swimmers continue in an annual event as a corpse is seen floating next to a sign on the river. At least 25,000 homes were destroyed and 440,000 people displaced during those floods, the Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs said in a statement

Swimming past: The body was spotted drifting in the water shortly after the event got underway in Wuhan, a nine-hour drive away from Fenghuang, where floods have left the ancient town submerged

Submerged: Only rooftops and the top section of a bridge (centre) can be seen above the floodwaters in the town of Fenghuang. The Tuojiang river, which runs through the town, burst its banks after days of heavy rain

Before the rain: This picture taken of the ancient town last year reveals the stunning homes and bridges that are now deep under water. Hundreds of thousands of residents, many of whom live along the river bank, have been forced to flee their homes

The mass evacuations in Fenghuang and its surrounding countryside came after a period of heavy rainfall in south and central China.

The conditions caused the Tuojiang river to burst its banks, 
leaving thousands of Fenghuang residents trudging 
through neck-deep water in some of the worst hit areas.

Bridges have been badly damaged - cutting off some parts of the town altogether - with up to 50,000 locals and tourists affected by a near-total electricity blackout in Fenghuang.

Xinhua news agency said the Tuojiang river is currently sitting a full 1.1metres above its previous highest recorded level, with up to 1,200 search and rescue personnel currently working to evacuate those affected by the floods.

Under threat: Much of Fenghuang dates back hundreds of years and boasts stunning Qing and Ming-dynasty era architecture. The areas worst affected by the floods are understood to be the historic 'old town'

Washed away: Homes and businesses lining the river were destroyed as flood water poured in over the burst banks of the Tuojiang river

An estimated 4,000 shops have been flooded, with thousands more hotels, bars and restaurants also under water.

The areas worst affected by the floods are understood to be the historic 'old town', which attracts tens of thousands of tourists from all over the world every year.

Fenghuang is an exceptionally well-preserved town with its own languages, customs and arts. It is placed in a mountain setting, and incorporates the natural flow of water into the city's layout.

Events in Fenghuang developed as an annual swimming gala took place amid heavy rain in the city of Wuhan in Hubei, a nine-hour drive away.

A total of 2,561 swimmers taking part in the event - held in the Yangtze river, which is itself heavily swollen by rain - were forced to dodge the body of a drowned man.

The body drifted past shortly after the event got underway.

Severe flooding hits central and southern China annually, often leading to hundreds of deaths.

In May this year floods killed at least 38 people and forced half a million to leave their homes in Guangdong province, which is directly south of Hunan and borders Hong Kong.

At least 25,000 homes were destroyed and 440,000 people displaced during those floods, the Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs said in a statement.
