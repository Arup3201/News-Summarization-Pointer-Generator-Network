Hundreds of mourners have flocked to the open casket funeral of a National Guardsman who was fatally shot by a police officer to remember him as a man devoted to his family and the U.S Army.

Noel Polanco, 22, was posthumously promoted to sergeant at his funeral in Queens, New York on Friday, a week after he was killed by an officer who had pulled his car over for driving erratically.

Detective Hassan Hamdy claimed he pulled the trigger after seeing Polanco, who was unarmed, reach for the car's floorboard, yet his passenger said he never took his hands from the wheel.

Friends and family members, including 
his mother and siblings, were overcome with emotion as they paid tribute
to Polanco and sobbed as they clutched his lifeless body dressed in 
uniform.

Remembered: Pall bearers carry the casket of Polanco from the Eternal Love Baptist Church in Queens

Loss: Polanco, 22, was promoted posthumously to sergeant as colleagues remembered him as devoted

His mother, Cecilia Reyes, addressed the flag-draped coffin bearing her son in the Eternal Love Baptist Church in Corona, Queens as she paid tribute, the New York Post reported.

'My son was an amazing child,' she said. 'My son was an angel, and I'm going to miss him with all my heart.'

Of the promotion, First Sgt. Gregory Sinclair said, to cheers from the mourners: 'This is a promotion for outstanding accomplishments and service.'

'They say the Army is like a family and I can tell you that saying is correct,' added Capt. Dan Colon.

'Noel was a good soldier. Always wanted to participate and always wanted to help.'

Reverend Al Sharpton eulogized Polanco and reminded mourners he had dreamed of becoming a New York City police officer.

'Why are we here?' he said. 'No crime. No weapon. No record.

'There is nothing this young man did to be here today. He was as right as you can get. He was a right as real folk can get.'

Speaking about the police, he added: 'When you saw him you saw a suspect. When he really was a sergeant. You saw a gang member. His gang was the U.S. Army.'

Mourning: During the service, Cecilia Reyes called her son an 'angel who I'm going to miss with all my heart'

Support: Reyes was joined by hundreds of mourners at the service, eight days after the killing

Farewell: Reyes is comforted by Rev. Al Sharpton as she stands over the body of her son

Missed: Rev. Al Sharpton eulogised Polanco. 'There is nothing this young man did to be here today,' he said

After the service, Polanco's remains were buried with military honors.

'I want my brother to rest in peace,' Sgt. Jonathan Polanco, Polanco's brother, told the New York Times. 'But along with peace, you need to have justice as well.'

Justice is being worked on: Conflicting accounts of the events leading to his death have led New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly to call for a grand jury investigation into the shooting.

Polanco was killed on October 4 when Hamdy, a former Marine and 14-year veteran of the NYPD, fired a single bullet during an early-morning traffic stop near La Guardia Airport.

Hamdy's attorney, Philip Karasyk, said his client maintains Polanco ignored police orders to put his hands in the air and instead 
reached down with both hands to the car's floorboard.

But witness Diane DeFerrari, 37, a bartender whom Polanco was driving 
home from her work at a Queens nightclub, said Polanco's hands never 
left the wheel.

After the shooting, Ms DeFerrari said she and a backseat passenger, an off-duty NYPD officer, were ordered out and told to put their hands on the car.

'The cop said, "Your friend just shot himself",' said Ms DeFerrari. 'I didn’t dispute what I saw because I was afraid. They wouldn’t let me look at him.'

Crime scene: Polanco was shot near LaGuardia Airport by an officer who said the man reached for the floorboard of his car. No weapon was found and a grand jury investigation will be carried out

The officer riding in Mr Polanco’s 
car, 29-year-old Vanessa Rodriguez, was waving her police ID out the 
window just before the shooting, sources said.

Karasyk said Hamdy, who has lost his job since the shooting, is 'more than eager' to tell his side of the story to investigating authorities.

His 'pulling the trigger did not occur in a bubble,' said 
Karasyk. 'Way before that happened, the driver was acting in such a 
manner as to continuously raise the level of threat' to the police.

Queens District Attorney Richard Brown has launched an investigation into the incident, as has the NYPD.
