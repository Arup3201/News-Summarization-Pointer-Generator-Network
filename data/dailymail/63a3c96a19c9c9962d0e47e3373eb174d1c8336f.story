A cancer research pioneer used computer software to spy on his ex-wife as they went through a bitter divorce, prosecutors have said.

Dr Steven Curley, 57, from Missouri City near Houston, Texas, faces 20 years in prison if convicted of the charge of unlawful intercept.

He allegedly plotted with a computer expert, Hand Lehmann, to install a tracking program called eBlaster, which records passwords, online conversations, keystrokes and webpage use.

Arrest: Dr Steven Curley has been charged with unlawful intercept after allegedly using spying software to monitor his ex-wife online. He is pictured left in his mug shot and right in an interview in 2007

Targeted: He allegedly used the software to spy on his ex-wife, Karen, after their failed two-year marriage

The popular program, which costs $100, is used by parents to track their children's internet use, by employers to watch their workers and by spouses checking for cheating partners, KHOU reported.

Curley allegedly used the program to 
spy on his wife Karen, a physician's assistant, as they divorced after 
just two years of marriage.

System: He allegedly used eBlaster, which records key strokes and internet use

The couple had once worked together at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.

Curley’s attorney, Robert Scardino, says he believes a bitter divorce is behind the accusations and that once further information comes to light, 'he'll be vindicated'.

'He’s very concerned that something like 
this could have an adverse effect on his career,' Scardino told KHOU.

'It’s certainly a 
distraction from what he does.'

Dr Curley, a Professor of Surgical Oncology, worked at MD Anderson to develop new ways of beating hard-to-treat cancers using radio waves.

In October, a report announced he had just been named chief of surgical oncology at the Dan L. Duncan Cancer Center at Baylor College of Medicine.

MD Anderson said he left the hospital at the end of 2013.

The spying program, eBlaster, is virtually undetectable after it has been put in a system, and once in place, it can capture activity on a computer and send details to an email address.

Sidney May from the Spy Emporium in Montrose told KHOU: 'We have customers that come back and buy multiple copies because they want to spy on the laptop and the desktop.'

Tracked: Curley's lawyer said once the details of his divorce with ex-wife Karen (pictured) become public, his client will be vindicated

It is legal for parents to use the software for their children's internet use, as well as employers and educators, although monitoring personal email remains a gray area.

But it is illegal for spouses to use the systems to spy; in 2007, an Austin, Texas man was sentenced to four years in prison for spying on his wife using a similar system, SpyRecon.

Curley and Lehmann both face a charge of unlawful intercept.

This case is set to go to court on January 22.
