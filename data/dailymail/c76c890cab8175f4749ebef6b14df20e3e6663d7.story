David Cameron compared Russia’s hostility towards Ukraine with the build-up to the two world wars last night, as he warned economic sanctions could get tougher.

The Prime Minister likened the situation to Belgium and Poland ‘being trampled on’ before wars broke out in Europe last century.

Speaking to voters in Warrington, he said: ‘This year we are commemorating the 100th anniversary of the First World War, and that war in part was about the right of a small country, Belgium, not to be trampled on by its neighbours.

'Unacceptable': Russian president Vladimir Putin’s actions to ‘undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty’ were last night denounced by the G7 nations – the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States

‘We had to learn that lesson all over again in the Second World War, when the same thing happened to Poland and Czechoslovakia and other countries.

‘In a way, this is what we see today in Europe. Ukraine is a country recognised by the United Nations, a country which has and should have every right to determine its own future ... it has the right not to have its territorial integrity impugned by Russia.’

Last night the G7 nations – the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States – denounced Russian president Vladimir Putin’s actions to ‘undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty’.

‘We once again condemn Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea, and actions to de-stabilise eastern Ukraine. Those actions are unacceptable and violate international law,’ a statement said.

Threatening further measures to cripple the Russian economy, Mr Cameron said: ‘It will be a tightening of the ratchet unless Mr Putin changes his approach.’

He added: ‘We are not about to launch a European war, we are not about to send a fleet to the Black Sea, we are not looking for a military confrontation. 

'What we should do is use the economic powers we have, the European Union and the United States of America, to demonstrate to Russia that what it is doing is unacceptable.’

This week, Europe and the US agreed tough sanctions against Russian banks, defence and energy firms. Pictures emerged last night suggesting Russia has responded by moving more military enforcements to the Ukraine border.
