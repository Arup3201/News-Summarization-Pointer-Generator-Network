Just two days after the country's prime minister Nawaz Sharif promised to crack down on terror groups, a Pakistani court granted bail to the granted bail to the alleged mastermind of the 2008 terror attacks in the Indian city of Mumbai.

Horrified by the attack on the Army Public School and College in Peshawar which left 148 pupils and teachers dead, Sharif promised 'to continue the war against terrorism till the last terrorist is eliminated.'

Nonetheless, a court bailed Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, who is accused of planning the 60-hour siege on India's economic capital left 166 people dead, after 10 gunmen attacked luxury hotels, a popular cafe, a train station and a Jewish center.      

Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi is accused of masterminding the Mumbai terror attacks that left 166 people dead. He was granted bail by a Pakistani court less than 48-hours after the country's prime minister Nawaz Sharif vowed to crack down on terrorists in the country  

Mumbai was under siege for more than 60 hours after 10 gunmen gunmen attacked luxury hotels, a popular cafe, a train station and a Jewish center. The attack damaged relations between India and Pakistan

It took Indian authorities almost three days to restore order. The sole surviving gunman from Mumbai, Pakistani-born Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, was hanged in India in 2012

Relations between the two nuclear-armed rivals worsened dramatically after the carnage which was blamed on the banned Pakistani militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). 

The court's decision came less than 48-hours Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif vowed to crack down on terror groups in Pakistan, as the country reels from the attack on the Army Public School and College in Peshawar. 

At least Seven extremist gunmen who sprayed children with bullets as they sat receiving first aid tuition and exploded suicide bombs.

Sharif also announced that a six-year moratorium on the death penalty would be lifted for those convicted of terror offences.

None of this stopped a judge at a court in the country's capital Islamabad, from granting bail to Lakhvi, the man prosecutors say masterminded the devastating Mumbai attacks. 

'We had moved a bail application with the Islamabad anti-terror court on December 10, today the judge granted bail to my client after hearing arguments from both sides,' his lawyer Rizwan Abbasi told AFP.

Prosecutor Mohammad Chaudhry Azhar confirmed the court had granted bail.

The horror of the Mumbai carnage played out on live television around the world, as commandos battled the heavily-armed gunmen, who arrived by sea on the evening of November 26.

It took the authorities three days to regain full control of the city and New Delhi has long said there is evidence that 'official agencies' in Pakistan were involved in plotting the attack, something Islamabad denies. 

The sole surviving gunman from Mumbai, Pakistani-born Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, was hanged in India in 2012.

The attacks traumatised India, exposing the antiquated weapons and methods of the local police force and revealing crucial gaps in the country's defences.

They also derailed a nascent peace process between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan.

In the wake of the Peshawar massacre on Tuesday, Sharif said Pakistan would not distinguish between 'good Taliban and bad Taliban' as it seeks to crush the scourge of homegrown Islamist militancy.
