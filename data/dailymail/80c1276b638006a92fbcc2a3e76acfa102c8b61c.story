Weddings can be expensive occasions not just for the bride and groom - but for their guests too.

But it was perhaps surprising to learn that even Prince William can feel the pinch - this weekend he was spotted in economy class when he took an internal flight in the US after celebrating his friend Guy Pelly’s marriage.

Prince William, who was in America with Prince Harry, took the American Airlines flight from Memphis to Dallas on Sunday.

The photo has re-tweeted dozens of times since it was posted on Twitter at the weekend. One user commented they thought he flew economy because it kept the cost down for the security detail

The photo was taken by US television reporter Eli Ross who was on the American Airlines flight - he posted the image on Twitter writing: 'I am still amazed #Prince William flies COACH. That's pretty humble/awesome. Who knew?'

Eli Ross is a reporter for Local 24 News and CW 30 News in Memphis - the station had already been covering the wedding extensively.

The cost of the trip itself is being met privately by both the princes - Prince William is understood to have changed planes at Dallas Fort Worth to return to the UK.

On the American Airlines plane he took a
 window seat and is understood to have ordered water during the 1hour 30
 domestic flight. A similar flight was on sale today for £250.

Holding his hand luggage he boarded a plane separately to the rest of the passengers in Memphis, surrounded by security officers.

The 31-year-old was then photographed at the Dallas airport wearing jeans, a pale blue shirt, white trainers and a baseball cap as he left the American Airlines Admiral Club.

The 
princes are accompanied round-the-clock by a team of around four 
taxpayer-funded officers from Scotland Yard’s Royalty Protection Squad.

One
 senior industry source estimated the cost of guarding the princes 
during their five-day trip would be in the region of $84,000, including 
business class flights and hotels for all of the officers.

It is not the first time that the royals have tried to save money when attending a wedding.

In
 2011 passengers were surprised to see Prince William and the Duchess of 
Cambridge settle into seats with the rest of the public after boarding a
 Flybe jet in Edinburgh for their hour long journey to Manchester 
following the wedding of Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall in Edinburgh.

Meanwhile,
 a hungover Prince Harry chose EasyJet to make his way home to London - 
he also flew to the Scottish city with the airline - checking in his 
green army-issue bag for £10.

During the recession the Queen urged her family to show restraint and to avoid overt displays of extravagance.

When they are on official duties the princes travel in first or business class along with their entourage.

The
 pictures which have emerged from the party at the weekend seem to show 
the pair had a good time at the wedding which saw Prince Harry's best 
friend marry Lizzy Wilson, the granddaughter of the Holiday Inn hotel 
empire founder.

Prince Harry, who was spotted ‘twerking’ on the dance floor, was having such a
 good time at the ‘unbelievably wild’ party that he made the band play 
five encores as he kept the party going beyond the 1am finish time.

And while his brother dominated the dancefloor, it was William who jumped on the stage singing the Isley Brothers’ Shout

Jimmy Church, whose Motown band provided the entertainment, told the 
Daily Mail: ‘It was a great night, it was unbelievably wild.

‘Prince
 William was in front of the stage moving to the music, and then all of a
 sudden it got to him and he got up on the stage and was singing and 
dancing. He was getting down and I was getting down.’
