Anyone who played 2011’s Rayman Origins will know that it was one of the year’s stand-out games. And Legends is no different – proudly sticking to its 2D side-scrolling roots to provide the most polished Rayman experience to date.

This is platform gaming at its absolute best – sprinting, swimming and swinging your way through gloriously-detailed worlds – dying often but not stopping until each level’s complete.

Dynamic: It may be a side-scrolling platformer, but every little detail of each level is teeming with life

And how beautiful those intricate levels are – ranging from ocean depths to murky swamps and beyond. They all feel that they belong to Rayman's world - oozing charm and character seldom seen in other platforming games.

Add to the mix a quite magical soundtrack and every level becomes as memorable as the last – especially the musical stages unlocked at the end of each world (which are best left a surprise).

Murfy takes on a more active role than he did in Orgins, helping our hero by cutting ropes, moving platforms and pocking monsters in eye.

Clearly designed with the Wii U GamePad in mind, it’s not quite as smooth on the Xbox 360 and PS3 – and although Murphy positions himself next to objects of interest to counter this, during harder levels it becomes incredibly challenging.

But this is but a slight blip in a game where even the ingenious loading screens (where Rayman must try and collect a bonus heart) stand head and shoulders above most games of recent years.

In an age of muti-layered gameplay and an obsession with graphical fidelity, Legends is proof that keeping things simple pays dividends. 

Challenging: You'll die many times in Legends, but its charm will have you coming back for more

Rayman Legends is out now.
