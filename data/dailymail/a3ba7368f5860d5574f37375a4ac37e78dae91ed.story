A teenager says having her ears pierced could have saved her life after she went on to discover cancerous lumps in her neck.

Chloe Carter, 13, had the studs fitted as a birthday present and found the growths just days later.

The teenager, who lives in Sampford Peverell, Devon, was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, a type of blood cell cancer on Friday, December 6.

Chloe Carter, 13, was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma after finding ball-like lumps on her neck while playing with her newly pierced ears at school

She said: ‘For my birthday, which was at the end of October, I was allowed my ears pierced.

‘A few days later I was in a science lesson and I noticed weird little ball-like lumps on my neck.

‘I said to my friends and they said it could just be a muscle or something so I didn't tell my mum.

‘Then it came up even worse so I eventually said to her a couple of days later and she took me to the doctors.’

Chloe’s mother, Sue, said: ‘At first I thought it was an infection from having the piercing. I never thought it would be anything else.’

Initially doctors thought the same but as time passed more lumps appeared and Chloe was sent for a series of tests.

Initially Chloe's parents, Sue and Phil, thought the lumps on her neck were caused by an infection resulting from her newly pierced ears

Her father, Phil, said: ‘We got a phone call two days later asking us to come in the following morning and I asked whether Chloe would need treatment and they said yes, so I knew then it wasn't good news.’

After arriving at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital the family were told she had a form of cancer known as Hodgkin's lymphoma.

‘I had never heard of it before in my life,’ said Chloe, who also has an older half-brother Ryan, 20, and younger sister Lily, 9.

Doctors explained that the form of the disease affects the lymph nodes, which are found throughout the body but the most common place for it to start is in the neck and then in the chest, under the arms and in the groin.

Mr Carter said: ‘All the doctors were very reassuring.’

When Chloe told her friend she had cancer and would need chemotherapy, they agreed to have their hair cut short with her. The group are pictured before their hair cuts with Chloe in the middle

Chloe was sent for a series of scans including an MRI, an ultrasound and a heart scan.

The teenager started chemotherapy on December 17 and will receive treatment every day until Christmas Eve, when her first course will be complete.

She will continue the next round of treatment after Christmas.

Mr Carter said: ‘After her treatment she will have to go back every three months for check-ups so she will be cared for for many years to come.’

To support their friend, a group of girls from Chloe's class organised to have their hair cut short when she had her head shaved on Sunday.

Her mother said: ‘Chloe went into school on the Monday, after finding out on the Friday, and asked to take a group of 10 friends to one side to tell them what happened.

‘She was really brave and the school was really supportive and I think she became a lot stronger after that. Her friends were absolutely fantastic and now five of them are going to cut their hair, which will be donated to the Prince’s Trust.’

Just a few days later Chloe, with the help of one of her father’s friends, set up her own fundraising page on Facebook, which already has almost 1,000 likes, to raise money for CLIC Sargent and Paediatric Oncology Exeter.

She said: ‘Once I told people they started coming up with loads of different ideas. We're having a 24 hour dance in January and a bake sale in school.’

Chloe's mother, Sue, said: 'At first we were just numb and it was hard to be normal. It's been the hardest ever Christmas. We tried to do some shopping on Friday but I just felt like a zombie'

Mr Carter added: ‘Some of the girls want to do a swim at the leisure centre and the distance will be roughly how far it is from our house to the hospital, which is about 18 miles, between them.

‘The men are also having a head shave and wax in February.’

Chloe’s mother said: ‘At first we were just numb and it was hard to be normal. It's been the hardest ever Christmas. We tried to do some shopping on Friday but I just felt like a zombie and it's the hardest time for this to happen because it's about kids.’

Mr Carter added: ‘We would like to thank the GP's at Clare House Surgery in Newport Street whose prompt action led us to the paediatric oncology team for treatment, who have been so supportive in every aspect of the treatment.’

Hodgkin's lymphoma is cancer of the B lymphocytes - a type of white blood cell found in the lymphatic system.

In people with lymphoma, the lymphocytes - infection fighting white blood cells - start to multiply abnormally.

They also lose their infection-fighting properties making the sufferer more prone to infection.

The most common first symptom of Hodgkin's lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node - usually in the neck, armpit or groin.

Other possible symptoms include unexplained tiredness, nigh sweats, fever, weight loss and a persistent cough.

The condition is most common in people between the ages of 15 and 35 and in the over 50s.

More men than women are affected and nearly 1,500 people are diagnosed in the UK each year.

It is a fairly aggressive cancer than can spread quickly through the body.

However, it is one of the most easily treated cancers.

Almost all young people with the disease will be fully cured.

For older people, the cure rare is 75 to 80 per cent.
