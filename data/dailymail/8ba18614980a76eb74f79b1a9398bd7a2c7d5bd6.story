Supersonic skydiver Felix Baumgartner fell faster than he or anyone else thought 
when he jumped from the edge of space in October.

The Austrian parachutist known as 'Fearless Felix' reached 
843.6 mph, according to the official numbers released Monday. That's equivalent 
to Mach 1.25, or 1.25 times the speed of sound.

His top speed initially was estimated last October at 834 mph, 
or Mach 1.24. Either way, he became the first human to break the sound 
barrier with only his body.

He wore a pressurized suit and jumped 24 miles up from a capsule 
hoisted by a giant helium balloon over New Mexico.

Baumgartner was supersonic for a half-minute - 'quite 
remarkable,' according to Brian Utley, the official record-keeping official who 
was present for the October 14 feat. His heart rate remained below 185 beats a 
minute, and his breathing was fairly steady.

The leap was from an altitude of 127,852 feet. That's 248 feet 
lower than original estimates.

'He jumped from a little bit lower, but he actually went a 
little bit faster, which was pretty exciting,' said Art Thompson, technical 
project director for the Red Bull-sponsored project.

'It's fun for us to see reaching Mach speeds and proving out a 
lot of the safety systems,' Thompson said in a phone interview from his 
aerospace company in Lancaster, Calif.

Thompson said everything pretty much unfolded as anticipated, 
with no surprises in the final report. The updated records were provided by 
Utley, official observer for the National Aeronautic Association's contest and 
records board. Utley was in Roswell, N.M., for Baumgartner's grand finale 
jump.

In the foreword of the 71-page report, Baumgartner said he 
never imagined how many people would share in his dream to make a supersonic 
free fall from so high.

Some 52 million people watched You Tube's live stream of the 
exploit.

The scientific and engineering experts who helped bring him 
back alive 'broke boundaries in their own fields just as surely as I broke the 
sound barrier,' Baumgartner wrote.

Baumgartner shattered the previous record for a free fall 
plunge, made by Joe Kittinger, an Air Force officer, in 1960.

Kittinger did not 
quite reach supersonic speed during his jump from 19.5 miles up.

With Baumgartner safely landed, researchers were exhilarated over the 
possibility his exploits could someday help save the lives of space 
travelers in a disaster.

Baumgartner's death-defying jump yielded a wealth of 
information about the punishing effects of extreme speed and altitude on
the human body - insights that could inform the development of improved
spacesuits, new training procedures and emergency medical treatment.

A
NASA engineer who specializes in astronaut escape systems said 
Baumgartner's mission 'gives us a good foundation' for improving the 
odds of survival for professional astronauts, space tourists and 
high-altitude pilots and passengers.

Dr Jonathan Clark, a former NASA flight surgeon who lost his wife in the space shuttle Columbia accident believes the data from Baumgartner's jump can be used to improve astronaut safety

'What I would hope is that, perhaps, 
this is just the first step of many, many advancements to come' in 
emergency bailouts, said Dustin Gohmert, who heads NASA's crew survival 
engineering office at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.

In an interview after Baumgartner 
became the first skydiver to break the speed of sound, Gohmert noted 
that researchers have spent decades working on self-contained space 
escape systems, with few significant advances.

Baumgartner's feat was sponsored by 
energy drink maker Red Bull, and NASA had no role.

But Dr Jonathan 
Clark, a former NASA flight surgeon who lost his wife, Laurel, in the 
space shuttle Columbia accident and dedicated himself to improving crew 
escape systems, was in charge of Baumgartner's medical team.

And he was thrilled at how much was learned.

Clark said his team is still 
analyzing all the medical data - heart rate, blood pressure and the like
- collected from sensors on Baumgartner's body.

Baumgartner's technique for righting 
himself may prove useful for companies like Virgin Galactic that are 
developing spacecraft that will take tourists up into space and right 
back down.

These enterprises will need to have some sort of emergency 
escape plan.

As for the now-ended shuttle program, Columbia was traveling too high and too fast during its 2003 descent for a Baumgartner-style exit to have helped the seven astronauts.

The spaceship broke apart about 40 miles up while traveling more than Mach 17, unleashing forces that tore the crew members' bodies apart.

In the 1986 Challenger disaster, the crew capsule shot out of the fireball that erupted during liftoff, but there are too many unknowns to say whether any lessons from Baumgartner's feat might have applied to that tragedy, Gohmert said.

Baumgartner's pressurized suit - a close cousin of the orange suits used by shuttle astronauts and the suits worn by high-altitude U-2 spy pilots - was designed for use in a standing, free-falling position, while conventional spacesuits are made primarily for sitting. By all accounts, the new suit performed well.

'I think all of us here in our lab specifically who have dealt with the shuttle suits have looked at this in wonder and amazement, and really appreciated what they did,' Gohmert said. 'And that efficiency that they brought it forth with is also a model for us to learn from as well.'
