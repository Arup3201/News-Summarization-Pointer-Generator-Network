Rodney Clavell's girlfriend has appeared in court accused of knocking down and killing a midwife, less than a day after her partner shot himself dead at the culmination of a 13-hour siege.

Samantha Farrer, 37, entered a plea of not guilty when she attended Adelaide Magistrates Court, which is located just over a block away from where Australia's most wanted man ended his life.

Prosecutors allege Ms Farrer was driving the car that struck and killed Kathleen Heraghty, a local midwife, as she cycled along a road last December. Ms Farrer also denies an aggravated count of driving without due care and to failing to stop at the scene of a fatal accident.

Wearing a black baseball cap, a black dress over black jeans, and long black boots, she hid her face behind sunglasses as she left the building. When she last appeared at court in March, Clavell had accompanied her.

All counts are unrelated to Clavell's time on the run, the brothel siege or his suicide.

As Ms Farrer was attending court, more details emerged about the siege, which ended with the death of her 46-year-old boyfriend.

Clavell knew at least one of the women he took hostage - and may have been at the brothel for up to four days before he killed himself with a gun while watching the siege on television.

The women were barricaded into a room and the gunman blocked the entry and exit to prevent police fron storming in.

This afternoon, South Australian police revealed scenes from inside the siege,  which they said were terrifying for the four women.

Trapped in a room and threatened by Clavell brandishing a firearm, the women desperately plotted their escape over the phone with police.

SA Police Assistant Commissioner Paul Dickson said when one woman tried to escape she was threatened by Clavell and prevented from leaving.

'A barricade was put up internally and there was Mr Clavell with a firearm,' Mr Dickson said.

He said Clavell sought refuge at Marilyn's Studio after a fortnight on the run because he knew 'one or two' women.

'I think It's quite obvious he believed because of the history of the last two weeks he was virtually safe there,' Mr Dickson said.

He confirmed Clavell died by firearm in a room and his body was found with the weapon next to a switched on television.

While he wouldn't confirm the firearm was a shotgun,  he said 'it definitely wasn't a .22'.

Mr Dickson said he expected police would be arresting people over the next few weeks for helping Clavell.

While he was on the run, police believe the fugitive assaulted a woman while armed with a shotgun and stole her car on May 25, and made threats to other people.

'Some of those threats were committed with a firearm to receive money to obtain mobile phones and be able to live in these different locations,' Mr Dickson said. 'In some degree he was extorting other people in that criminal fringe.'

Clavell's death will now be investigated by major crime detectives, who will prepare a report for the coroner.

On May 20, a warrant was issued for the arrest of Clavell, who had a long criminal history, over firearm matters.

Since the warrant was issued, police raided more than 80 premises. Thursday's siege, which began at 1am, led to the lockdown of parts of the Adelaide CBD near the brothel.

Clavell, who was once seen wearing a Ned Kelly T-shirt in a picture posted on his girlfriend's Facebook page, was not always a fugitive.

The gunman was once a devout Christian and father to 11 children, who worked in various welding jobs. He did not have his first run-in with the law until he was aged 35.

Former associates of Clavell believe he was steered onto a dangerous, criminal path when he started working as a prison guard, sometime before 2002.

David Sly, who worked with Clavell at the Yatala and Mobilong prisons, said Clavell's turn from prison guard to criminal was not the first he had seen.

'A lot of his former colleagues will be thinking about this and we've seen so many of our mates, you know, go off the rails and here's another one,' Mr Sly told ABC.

'He was involved with his church, he was involved with his family, he was a promising correctional officer, he was fit, he was talented, he was articulate.

'I think exposure to the prison environment and family breakdown, I suppose a number of things could have led to this.'

Around this time Clavell was a boxing enthusiast and gym junkie who started using steroids and eventually illegal drugs.

'He became this right-wing Christian guy but he was always pumping iron. As he was doing it he had this look, like he was angry underneath,' one former associate told The Advertiser.

Clavell even got his 26-year-old son Daniel Clavell hooked on steroids when he was a teenager.

Daniel Clavell appeared in Adelaide Magistrates Court last month where he plead guilty to four random assaults on strangers.

His lawyer Nikki Conley said the 26-year-old had been on a steroid bender and blamed his former-prison guard father for introducing him to steroids at age 16.

Ms Conley said in recent months Clavell had become a Muslim.

'His new-found faith has changed his life,' she said. 

'He is a man who wants to implement changes in his life in the future.'

Back in 2002 Rodney Clavell was charged with four counts of assaulting a family member and one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

He faced court charged with allegedly assaulting his wife and some of their children. He denied all allegations.

The charges were dismissed because they could not be proved 'beyond reasonable doubt'.

In 2003 he was dismissed by the Department for Correctional Services.

But it was in 2004 that Clavell became infamous in South Australia.

He was involved in a shootout with police after he led them on a 46km chase, at one point driving behind the wheel of a 12-tonne bulldozer.

With a shotgun pointed at his own heart, Clavell led police on a slow-speed chase during which he was shot in the thigh by an officer who he had attempted to run down.

A police sniper eventually stopped Clavell after shooting him in the shoulder.

Clavell was initially charged with two counts of attempted murder and two counts of shooting at a person with intent to resist lawful apprehension but the charges were later dropped.

He was sentenced to four years and four months in jail over offences relating to theft, driving in a dangerous manner and carrying a loaded firearm.

In prison in 2008 he was involved in a three-day riot with 35 other inmates.

In 2011 Clavell was in trouble with the law again, found guilty of driving dangerously to escape a police pursuit.

In February this year he was found not guilty of over an attack on a woman who was punched in the face with a studded leather glove.

In March, Clavell attended court to support his girlfriend Samantha Farrer, 37, who was charged with causing death by dangerous driving and leaving the scene of an accident. She has yet to enter a plea.

On Thursday afternoon Clavell was found dead inside the brothel where he had been hiding out in Adelaide's CBD.

Clavell's half-brother Wayne Clavell said more should have been done to prevent the death.

'They should have got hold of his mother or his sister, got the mother here or the sister to try and negotiate,' he said.

Police Assistant Commissioner Paul Dickson said police located Mr Clavell deceased at about 1.40pm, after deploying a robot to search the premises at about 12.55pm.

'That robot took some time to search the premises but was able to locate Mr Clavell in a position which we believed he was deceased,' he said.

The matter has been determined to be a death in custody and an investigation and file will now be prepared for the coroner.
