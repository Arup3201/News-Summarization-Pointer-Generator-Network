A diligent student who had his appendix taken out was told he couldn't go to school for a week so he went in as a robot instead.

Jeffrey Kaji, a high school freshman at the prestigious Long Island School for the Gifted, couldn't afford to miss a lot of school after his surgery so he attended all of his classes and even socialized with friends at lunch as a robot.

Jeffrey’s mother works at a company called A+ Technology and Security Solutions that creates the mobile computer devices.

Hard worker: Jeffrey Kaji operates the robot from his desk at home and can participate in classes 

The wheeled creation allows users to control a traveling screen with which they can interact with others.

Jeffrey sits at his home computer which he uses to control the device and talk to teachers during his lessons.

'I missed a lot last week, but over the past two days I've made up a lot,'said Jeffrey.

Despite not being at school in person Jeffrey’s mother said that his days are pretty much the same, although at the moment he's the most popular boy-robot in school. 

'In the evening, when we sat at dinner and talked about his day at school, it was like he was at school,' mom Margie Gurwin told ABC.

'It was all the same stories, except now he's being mobbed because he's the most popular kid there.'

The device can be a great tool for people who are physically handicapped or ill and will give them more opportunities to lead normal lives and do everyday activities. 

'We see, long term, this can help with students who are disabled, people with physical handicaps' said Steve Cina, of A+ Technology. 

'I think now we can offer it as a service to schools where they can rent or lease a robot for specific situations like this.'

Class robot: Jeffrey is able to answer questions in his class from his very own room at home
