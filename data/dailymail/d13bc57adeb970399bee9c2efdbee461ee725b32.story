Lukas Podolski has not taken kindly to advice from former Germany captain Lothar Matthaus as he closes in on a loan move to Inter Milan.

Forward Podolski is set to join the Serie A side on a temporary deal after falling out of favour with Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger.

And Matthaus, who led West Germany to World Cup glory in 1990, believes the 29-year-old must devote more time to football and less to social media if he is to get his career back on track in Italy.

Speaking to Sky Germany, Matthaus said: 'Lukas has his qualities; now he must prove them by bringing them back to the pitch.

'In the past we heard how he tweets more than he plays. He needs to concentrate on football.'

Podolski decided to respond to Matthaus - via Twitter - choosing to make reference to the 53-year-old's five marriages - four of which failed. 

In German, Podolski tweeted: 'I find it very amusing that Matthaus should give me precise tips on how to behave.'

Former Bayern Munich forward Podolski took to Instagram to say goodbye to Arsenal's supporters

The former Bayern Munich man also included emoticons of a bride and love heart, plus the hashtag #Erfolgscoach which directly translates as 'successcoach'.

That is most likely a sarcastic reference to Matthaus' largely unsuccessful managerial career, which included shorts spells at clubs including Rapid Vienna, Partizan Belgrade and Red Bull Salzburg. 

Podolski, who was pictured meeting Inter boss Roberto Mancini on Saturday, has said goodbye to the Arsenal faithful on Instagram, indicating that he may not return to the Emirates this summer.
