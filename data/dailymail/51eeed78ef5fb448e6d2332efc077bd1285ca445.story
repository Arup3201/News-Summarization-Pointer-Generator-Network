George Ioannou, the British pop-artist famous for his iconic ‘Gangster Art’ is back with a new series of paintings which strip iconic celebrity culture to the bone – literally.

Ioannou first came to fame in the late 1990s when he launched a collection of ground breaking paintings depicting iconic scenes from cult movies.

His interpretations of the Al Pacino character, Tony Montana in the 1983 film Scarface created a style which made Ioannou one of the UK’s most collectable modern artists.

The Croydon-born artist's work now sells for around £30,000 for an original and his clients include singer Adele, oligarch Roman Abramovich and Dragon’s Den star Theo Paphitis.

George Ioannou, the British pop-artist famous for his iconic 'Gangster Art' exhibition is back with a new series of paintings, including Michael Jackson and Marilyn Monroe, which strip iconic celebrity culture to the bone

Ioannou first came to fame in the late 1990s when he launched a collection of ground breaking paintings depicting iconic scenes from cult movies. His latest work recreates famous people like Amy Winehouse and Freddie Mercury as ghoulish skulls

Other
striking images of popular icons through the ages such as Marilyn 
Monroe, Steve McQueen and Jimi Hendrix were followed by more movie 
images – Michael Caine in Get Carter and The Italian Job, John Travolta 
and Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction and Jack Nicholson in The Shining.

Now,
Ioannou has unveiled a new celebrity inspired collection entitled ‘Dead Famous’.

The series of thirteen paintings depict the 
skulls of internationally known celebrities from the past and present.

Audrey Hepburn. David Bowie, Marilyn Monroe and Bob Marley are among the stars given the spooky pop art treatment.

Their bones are laid bare with only small details added which make their
true identities unmistakable.

Ioannou's work has become sought after by investors and original prints can sell for up to £30,000. Images of Jimi Hendrix and Elvis as skulls are expected to be among the most popular in his Dead Famous work

‘I think the power of these paintings 
is how they give so little away yet the small details that remain tell a
full story – hopefully part of the story behind the mask of celebrity,’
says the 38-year-old artist.

‘What makes a person recognisable when 
they are stripped to the bone? Who made dreadlocks famous? Who made 
bleach blonde hair or drop earrings iconic? And who made a bow in their 
hair notorious?’ says Ioannou.

’I am fascinated by the 
influence celebrities have on our lives and how the legacy of the true 
icons continues to grow long after the real person has gone,' he says.

’The 
flesh grows old but style lasts for ever.

His client list includes Oscar winner Adele, oligarch Roman Abramovich and Dragon's Den star Theo Paphitis, but who will snap up the latest canvas's featuring late Nirvana star Kurt Cobain and singer David Bowie

The series of thirteen paintings depicts celebrities, including Sid Vicious and Madonna, with their bones laid bare and only small details added which make their true identities unmistakable

 Ioannou adds: 'People are visual by nature 
and iconic status is often defined by how celebrities stand out from the
pack in order to make a difference.

'But, which is most important – a 
manufactured look or natural talent?

Ioannou
also runs an art collective from his coffee shop in Coulsdon, Surrey.
