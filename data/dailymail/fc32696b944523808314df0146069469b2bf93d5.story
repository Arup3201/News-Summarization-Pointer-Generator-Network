An argument between a wealthy couple living in the upscale community of Boca Raton, Florida, on Sunday evening ended with both spouses dead after the man killed his wife and was then shot by police after allegedly turning his gun on them.

‘Devoted family man’ Ian Burlakoff, 41, his wife Germana, 37, and their four children had been enjoying dinner at the Boca Raton country club on Sunday night when an argument between the couple escalated out of control. 

While on the outside the couple - prominent members of the local community - looked to have it all, they were in fact engulfed in crisis, in the midst of a divorce and due to lose possession of their near $2 million home.

To the outside world Ian and Germana Burlakoff might have looked that a couple that had it all but they were engulfed in crisis - in the midst of a divorce and due to lose possession of their near $2 million home

Records show they owed between $1.4 million and $1.8 million on their home at the luxury The Oaks resort, which was set to be sold at auction next March if it wasn't paid off.

Ian Burlakoff was a general manager at King Hyundai in Deerfield Beach, earning $800,000 a year and was described by stunned employees as a devoted father who also did a lot of volunteer work.

Germana Burlakoff, who also went by the name Gemma, was a stay-at-home mother who cared for their three children – aged seven, five and one, plus his 12-year-old daughter from a previous marriage.

The Burlakoffs had married in 2005, but just two months later he had been granted a temporary injunction against his wife, although the injunction was dismissed days later.

After the couple began fighting on Sunday, Gemma Burlakoff tried to escape to her mother's condo in Boca Raton but husband Ian shot her in the street

The Burlakoffs owed between $1.4 million and $1.8 million on their home at the luxury 'The Oaks' resort in Boca Raton and the house was set to be sold at auction next March if it wasn't paid off

In June of this year Ian Burlakoff had filed for divorce, which was still pending.

Gemma Burlakoff told a court in July that since filing for divorce, her husband had refused to support their children.

She said he refused to pay the mortgage, and threatened to shut the home’s power off if she continued having her mother to the house. 

Gemma’s father Frank Villareale said his daughter had told him everything was fine between the couple when he had spoken to her two days before.

He described his daughter as friendly and personable, but told the Sun Sentinel
 that the couple had often fought over her husband's ‘gambling habit.’

Ian Burlakoff had accused his wife of 'outrageous shopping sprees' during which she would purchase hundreds of pairs of shoes 
ranging from over $1,000 per pair. Records also show she liked pricey 
purses too, spending upwards of $5,000 for a handbag.

Relatives of Germana Burlakoff, 37, embrace after finding out that she was  murdered by her husband Ian on Sunday. An aunt described Germana's husband as a mean man who deserved to be shot

In return, she had accused her 
husband of spending $1,000 a week on body waxing and steroids and 
questioned why he had booked a two-bedroom suite at the Waldorf-Astoria 
in Manhattan.

'He deserved to be shot,' an aunt of 
Gemma Burlakoff told the Palm Beach Post. 'He was a mean man. My niece 
did not deserve this. She was a beautiful girl.'

Burlakoff’s ex-wife, who didn't wish to be named, described her ex-husband as an amazing father.

She said she believed that her ex-husband was bipolar, which Gemma Burlakoff had also stated in court documents.

'It doesn't make any sense. They had four kids. He was a good guy and a family man,' Bonnie Shafter, an employee of Burlakoffs told WPTV.com.

After the couple began fighting on Sunday, Gemma Burlakoff tried to escape to her mother's condo at Chalfonte, an oceanfront highrise on Ocean Boulevard.

Ian Burlakoff was a general manager at King Hyundai in Deerfield Beach, earning $800,000 a year and was described by stunned employees as a devoted father who also did a lot of volunteer work

But her husband followed her there and shot her at about 6 p.m. across the street from the building.

Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Teri Barbera said Boca Raton police officers who responded to the shooting encountered an armed Ian Burlakoff in the northbound shoulder of Ocean Boulevard.

He ignored officers' commands and reached for his handgun, and a Boca Raton police officer fired shots at him, she said.

The incident shocked residents of the upscale community, which rarely sees much crime. The children are currently staying with their grandmother.
