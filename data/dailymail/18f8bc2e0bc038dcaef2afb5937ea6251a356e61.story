A ten-day-old clouded leopard kitten at a Tampa zoo just melted everyone's hearts by relaxing and just being cute as he was washed under a water faucet. 

The endangered kitten, who has not yet been named and is being cared for at the Lowry Park Zoo, has just began to open his eyes and hasn't even taken his first step. 

And when zoo staff members wash him in the sink and feed him with a bottle, he's as cute as ever.

The ten-day-old clouded leopard kitten, who has yet to be named, is being fed and watched over by staff at the Lowry Park Zoo in Tampa, Florida

Staff members said he has barely opened his eyes, has yet to walk and will be watched 'round-the-clock' for the next few months

The kitten is given 'round-the-clock' care where he'll be fed and watched after for about three months by staff, according toFOX Tampa Bay.  

He is expected to start walking in about two weeks, and zoo staff will determine his future home in the next few weeks.  

Four-year-old clouded leopards Yim and Malee were paired as potential mates in 2011, when they arrived at the zoo, by the Clouded Leopard Species Survival Plan, which supports the conservation of the endangered animal. 

They then conceived their first born - the kitten who was born this month.  

Vice President of animal science and conservation at the zoo Dr Larry Killmar said the birth 'signifies a milestone accomplishment' for the conservation programs.

'Species survival programs for animals like the clouded leopards take years of planning, development and staff commitment. The kitten will contribute to the long-term viability of our conservation efforts within the managed population,' Killmar told FOX.  

The kitten is expected to start walking in a couple weeks. He is the baby of two four-year-old clouded leopards at the zoo who were matched as potential mates in 2011 by a conservation group

The clouded leopard is an endangered species and it is common practice in zoos to hand-raise all new born kittens

Clouded leopards are the smallest of the 'big cats', weighing between 30 and 50lb when fully grown. 

The cat - the most talented climbers among the cats - is classified as 'vulnerable' on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (ICUN) and its total population is no more than 10,000.

This is down to factors such as deforestation, illegal trading and poaching commercially. Some parts, such as claws, skin and teeth are also consumed for decoration purposes. 

As such, it is important to do as much as possible to ensure the health and well-being of the threatened animal.

It is common practice in zoos to hand-raise all newborn clouded leopards.

The cat is most commonly found in the Himalayan foothills through mainland Southeast Asia into China.
