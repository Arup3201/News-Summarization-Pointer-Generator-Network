Animal lovers who feel bad about kicking their dogs and cats off the sofa can assuage their guilt with a new range of furniture just for pets.

But if they expect to save money on the disproportionately small beds, sofas and chaise-longues they are likely to be disappointed - the items cost up to £1,500 each.

Designer Kate May insists the price tag is worth it for pet owners to bestow luxury on their beloved animals with a leather Chesterfield sofa or a fur-lined chaise-longue.

Comfort: The chairs are ideal for pet owners who feel guilty about kicking their dogs off the furniture

Since starting her company Pink Whiskers seven years ago, the qualified furniture maker has compiled an international client list.

'I understand cats and dogs because I have got my own,' Ms May said. 'I understand that each breed wants something different from a bed, whether it's a chin rest or a deep base that they can bury themselves in.

'Every animal is different, and they want somewhere comfortable to sleep, just like we do.

'We only use high-quality materials and the best quality fabrics to give every cat or dog a little bit of luxury.'

Ms May, 50, started the business after completing a furniture production course at Burnley College, setting up a workshop and showroom in Clitheroe, Lancashire.

She completes every bespoke order entirely by herself, from building a solid wood frame to upholstering the bed in her client's chosen finish.

Each of her creations is completely unique - but one of her leather chairs has proved popular with a number of clients.

'It's a scaled-down version of a leather porter's chair with a hood. It's the type that sits in hotel foyers, and my cat Daisy loves it,' the entrepreneur said.

'She clearly felt all snuggly and secure in there and that's when I got the idea for pet beds.

'People love their animals and want the best for them. I'm often asked to match fabrics and colour schemes with home decor.

'I've made furniture for all types of dogs, but the biggest was for a Great Dane in Scotland, which measured three metres long.'

Ms May started off as a cat lover, but after setting up her business she decided she should get a dog too, and soon became a self-described 'rescue freak'.

She now has four lurchers, a mini dachsund, a cat and a horse, and uses her pets to try out new designs.

'I started off with cat beds but then I had people coming into the showroom asking for dog beds,' she said. 'I didn't have a dog, so I thought I'd better get one, and now I've got five!

'They are a big part of the business and they love lying in the beds, we've got a fair few knocking around at home.

'Many people tell me that their dog has sleeping on the bed, but they don't know how to get out of the habit. My beds do the trick.'
