A Los Angeles judge has rejected a bid by Michael Jackson's mother Katherine Jackson to secure a new trial in the wrongful death lawsuit against AEG Live, the late Michael Jackson's concert promoter.

A jury already found AEG Live not liable for over $1 billion in damages in October after a five-month trial.

The Jackson matriach had filed documents in early December asking for another chance to convince a jury that the company should be found liable, claiming a number of mistakes were made during the original trial.

Although Monday's ruling was not in her favor, Jackson isn't giving up.

She intends to take her case to the California Court of Appeal and according to TMZ has already filed legal documents with the court.

Concert promoter AEG Live urged 
Katherine Jackson to move on after losing their legal tussle over the 
death of her pop superstar son Michael as she prepared to file documents in December.

According to TMZ, lawyers for the firm argued the bid was a desperate last ditch effort and that jury instructions at the original hearing were fair and taken directly from the California Civil Jury instruction guide book.

'We couldn't be more pleased with the court's ruling,' AEG's lead lawyer Marvin Putnam said Monday, reports the New York Daily News.

'We were confident that the court would uphold the jury's verdict, the product of five months of their careful focus and attention,' he said.

A Los Angeles jury in October cleared AEG Live of negligence in the singer's 2009 death following a lengthy trial.

Katherine had accused the concert promoters of being negligent for hiring her son's personal physician, Dr. Conrad Murray.

Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for giving the King of Pop a fatal overdose of the anesthetic propofol in 2009.

The jury found that AEG Live, while promoting the singer's This Is It comeback concert, was not liable for Murray's actions.

They found that Murray was neither 'unfit' nor 'incompetent' when he was hired by AEG.

The family claimed there were numerous reasons to grant another trial, including: jury misconduct, new evidence and general procedural errors.

In her first trial, Katherine was seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages for herself and her late son's three children, Prince, Paris and Blanket.

Murray was released from jail in October after he served less than two years of a four-year sentence for involuntary manslaughter.
