Apple is preparing to launch a huge 12.9inch tablet to go alongside its new, larger iPhone 6 handsets. 

Apple Inc's suppliers are preparing to manufacture the company’s largest-ever iPad, according to Bloomberg.

It claims 'people with knowledge of the matter' say production is scheduled to commence by the first quarter of next year.

Apple currently produces iPads with 9.7-inch and 7.9-inch displays - but a new 12.9inch version is believed to be in the works. Here, Apple boss Tim Cook introduces an earlier iPad.

Google’s Android mobile operating system became the top tablet operating system last year, with 62 percent of the market, according to researcher Gartner Inc. 

IPads that use Apple’s iOS mobile software had a 36 percent market share at the end of 2013, down from 53 percent a year earlier, according to the researcher.

The new iPad will have a screen measuring 12.9 inches diagonally, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the details aren’t public.

Apple is also increasing the screen size of the iPhone.

It is believed the company is holding an event on Sept. 9 to debut new bigger-display iPhones

The iPhones will come in two new models: one with a 4.7-inch screen and another with a 5.5-inch screen. 

Apple is hoping to boost iPad sales with its new range, after they slumped 9 per cent in the last quarter.

The iPhone maker reported sales of $37.4 billion (£21.9 billion) in its third quarter ending June, falling short of expectations for about $38 billion (£22.3 billion).

The Cupertino-based company also revealed that only 13.2 million iPads were sold in the last quarter, compared to 16.3 million in the previous quarter.

The results have triggered fears that iPad sales are set to get worse once Apple launches its rumoured, large-screen iPhone this autumn.

Jitesh Ubrani, an analyst at researcher IDC, said while tablet sales growth has slowed, he projects businesses, schools and governments will become bigger buyers of the devices. 

Those groups accounted for 16 percent of tablet sales in the second quarter this year, up from 13 percent a year earlier, he estimated.

'We’re expecting larger tablets to do better' in the enterprise market, Ubrani said in an interview.

Reports claim Apple suppliers have begun manufacturing the new range of iPads ahead of an October launch.

And sources believe the devices will have anti-reflective laminated displays to make it easier to use in bright light, and outside - compared to current, reflective models.
