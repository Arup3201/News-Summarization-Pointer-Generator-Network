Officials have announced that Cole Randall and Shpresa Lieshiaj, a Minnesota couple who perform as folk duo Flora Cash, were the couple questioned at Pompeys Pillar several weeks ago after setting off a silent alarm.

It wasn't until a week later that a staff member inspecting the grounds noticed that the monument, inscribed with Captain William Clark's signature in 1806, had been vandalized.

Officials have not named the man arrested in connection to the crime, but all evidence points towards Cole Randall, who visited the monument with his partner Shpresa Lieshiaj.

Crazy in love: Cole Randall and Shpresa Lieshiaj, aka Flora Cash, visited Pompeys Pillar and left an inscription of their names on it

'Senseless vandalism': A man has been arrested for creating this graffiti, found just three feet from the 1806 signature of Captain William Clark which made Pomeys Pillar a landmark

The carving, which reads ‘Cole + 
Shpresa 10/10/2013’ with a love heart, was found by shocked deputies at 
the famous monument in Montana.

Ignoring
the warning signs, security cameras and railings, a man from Minnesota 
admitted to the crime, which has been described as a ‘senseless act of 
vandalism’.

The man now faces charges under federal law which protects national monuments.

The 1806 signature is one of the last remaining pieces of physical evidence of the Lewis and Clark expedition, the first explorers to cross the western region of America.

Jonathan Peart, the director of Friends of Pompeys Pillar, told 3KRTV.com: ‘This belongs to all of us - to you, to me to every American out there and to deface this is just a senseless act of vandalism and violence to something that has historical and cultural importance.’

A silent alarm alerted Bureau of Land Management (BLM) deputies that someone had climbed over the guard rail on October 10. A man and a woman were questioned and their contact details recorded but it was not until a week later that the love message was found by an employee.

Reviewing security footage, the suspected culprit was soon found according to Peart.

He said: ‘These National treasures should be treated with respect and those who don't need to be punished.’

The man is yet to be officially identified as the BLM continues to investigate.

According to WDEF.com, Montana/Dakotas BLM spokesman Melodie Lloyd said that the suspect had been apprehended and charges are yet to be filed.

Consequences: The couple were questioned after setting off a silent alarm but when the vandalism was discovered officials sought a more serious response

Historical importance: The man faces felony charges for defacing Pomeys Pillar (pictured), a 150-foot sandstone butte in the Yellowstone Valley

To remove the graffiti will cost between $4,000 and $5,000, according to the Friends of Pompeys Pillar.

The monument is open to the public on foot every day of the year but barriers restrict visitor access to the signature.

Captain William Clark scrawled his name and the date, July 25, 1806, on the 150-foot sandstone butte in the Yellowstone Valley after his return to America. The signature looks as it did some 200 years ago.

The monument, 25 miles northeast of Billings, Montana, attracts some 50,000 every year. It was named a national monument in 2001.

The Flora Cash Facebook site and blog have been disabled.

According to the Billings Gazette, the monument was also defaced in June 2012.
