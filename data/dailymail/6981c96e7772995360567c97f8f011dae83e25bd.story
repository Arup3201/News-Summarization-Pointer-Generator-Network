An American schooner missing for more than three weeks has failed to turn up during what officials have called the 'biggest search' ever conducted in the waters surrounding New Zealand.

David Dyche, 58, was captaining Nina, a 70-foot yacht that Dyche, his wife, their son and four other crew members were sailing from New Zealand to Newcastle, Australia, when the historic vessel made contact with meteorologist Bob McDavitt asking how to get away from a storm on June 3. A message asking for further advice the next day was the last time anyone heard from the vessel.

New Zealand Search and Rescue officer Neville Blakemore said his team turned up nothing in their extensive search for the schooner and that he has grave fears for the crew of the 85-year-old Nina.

Captain: David Dyche was at the helm of the Nina when she disappeared three weeks ago

Without a trace: Rosemary Dyche told friends she was having 'the adventure of a lifetime'

Trip of a lifetime: Rosemary and David Dyche's son, also named David, was traveling with his parents before starting university

Adventure: Captain David Dyche and Rosemary are both experienced sailors

'The areas that have been searched 
have been absolutely massive and the area searched is the biggest area 
the Rescue Coordination Center of New Zealand has ever undertaken,' 
Blakemore told NBC News.

'The
 comprehensive search by the Orion [aircraft] the last couple of days 
has indicated that if the yacht was still afloat they would have seen it
 in the search area. So we are assuming that it's not in the search area
 and thus probably had a catastrophic event.'

Dyche, his wife Rosemary, 60, and son David, 17, left Opua in the Bay of Islands in New Zealand aboard 
the schooner on May 29.

New Zealand meteorologist Bob 
McDavitt says it was Nemeth who contacted him about the storm, asking, 
'The weather's turned nasty, how do we get away from it?'

'She was quite controlled in her 
voice, it sounded like everything was under control,' McDavitt said, 
adding that the call itself indicated she was concerned about the 
conditions.

Missing: Hope is fading for the seven people aboard the American schooner, Nina, which disappeared between New Zealand and Australia three weeks ago

Extensive search: Search and rescue workers scanned the waters all the way to the Australian coastline in their search for the missing yacht

Retired: Evi Nemeth is a retired Colorado University professor and computer engineer and the last member of the schooner's crew anyone has spoken to since June 4

McDavitt said he spoke only briefly to Evi Nemeth, advising her to head south 
and to brace for a storm with strong winds and high seas. The next day 
he got a text, the last known communication from the boat: 'ANY UPDATE 4
 NINA? ... EVI'

McDavitt said he advised the crew to 
stay put and ride out the storm another day.

He continued sending 
messages the next few days but didn't hear back.

Friends of the crew got
 in touch with McDavitt soon after that, and alerted authorities on June 14.

Blakemore didn't rule out the possibility of survivors but said the 'logical conclusion' is that the boat sank rapidly, preventing the crew from sending out an emergency SOS.

He told NBC that the locator beacon onboard Nina was not activated by water pressure and wouldn’t start automatically if the boat sank.

Vanished: Maritime New Zealand called off its search in July, saying it had found no sign of the 70ft wooden vessel Nina

'If the vessel got knocked over by a rogue wave it would have happened very, very quickly and they may not have had time to, to launch any life-saving equipment,' Blakemore said.

Search and rescue teams are now looking for evidence of wreckage.

Authorities say the storm three weeks
 ago saw winds gusting up to 110 kilometers (68 miles) per hour and 
waves of up to 8 meters (26 feet).

Kevin
 Banaghan, who is spearheading search efforts by Maritime New Zealand’s 
Rescue Coordination Centre, said that on June 14, a communications 
search began in which rescue workers tried contacting the boat over 
various radio frequencies and by contacting other vessels in the area to
 see if they’d seen the Nina.

Missing: The boat left the Bay of Islands, pictured, in northern New Zealand on May 29. Authorities say the last communication was on June 4, when the Nina was about 370 nautical miles west of New Zealand

This week, he said, rescuers escalated their efforts. An Air Force plane Tuesday searched the area where the boat disappeared. A second search by the plane Wednesday went as far as the Australian coast but again turned up nothing. The team is now weighing up other search options.

Rosemary Dyche has been documenting the family's travels on Facebook. At the beginning of the trip in 2011, she wrote:  'I am now on an adventure of a lifetime going around the world with my Wonderful husband who is my best friend and our youngest son.'

'But I do Miss my 2 older sons Justin and Kevin and my grand kids Katelynn and Sean my mom. And all my friends. But we have to do it now while we can.'

The Nina hasn't been seen or heard from since asking for advice on how to get away from a

Despite fears, rescue
