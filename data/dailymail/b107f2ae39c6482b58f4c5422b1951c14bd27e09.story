Sony bosses are bracing themselves for more embarrassment in the latest wave of hacked emails. 

Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton has called on his department heads to offer a 'blanket apology' in advance of any details that come out, claim industry sources.

Insiders said that top executives at Sony Music are particularly worried about details of salaries and artists' contracts and performance riders being released  by hackers Guardians of the Peace.

Artists signed to Sony labels include Beyoncé, One Direction, David Bowie, AC/DC, Pitbull, Barbra Streisand and Adele.

Sony's movie division was rocked with scandal last month after hackers released a series of emails between Sony co-chairman Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin.

They appeared to mock President Obama, implying he only liked movies with black actors and subject matter. Rudin also launched a scathing attack on actress Angelina Jolie, calling her a 'minimally talented spoiled brat'.

Details of employees' salaries and medical records, as well as new scripts were also leaked online, in a series of hacking attacks stemming from Seth Rogen and James Franco's Kim Jong-un assassination comedy 'The Interview.'

But now it appears as though Sony Music may have become a target after recently leaked e-mails revealed that the division was working on a 'top-secret project'  to potentially sell off music publishing division Sony/ATV.

Mr Lynton and Sony/ATV head Martin Bandier have both denied Sony Music is for sale.

But insider sources  told Page Six the CEO then called a number of department heads within Sony, including Mr Bandier and Sony Music CEO Doug Morris, 'to give a blanket apology in advance for whatever else comes out,'.

However, another source close to Sony disputed the claims that Mr Lynton made a blanket apology and said he only called two top executives about a number of specific issues.

Another insider added that Sony Music execs are 'really stressed their stuff is going to get leaked,' including, 'information on salaries and artists' recording contracts.' 

If looks could kill: Sony chairman Amy Pascal ran into Angelina Jolie days after the emails discussing the actress were leaked

Last month saw a stream of emails released by hackers which appeared to attack many of Hollywood's A listers and even mocked Barack Obama.

The shocking revelations were released by hackers Guardians of the Peace, linked to North Korea, in response to the Kim Jong-un assassination comedy 'The Interview'.

The hackers began their reign of terror on November 24 by hacking into employee computers and displaying a flashing skull with a cryptic message informing workers 'we've obtained all your internal data.'

The computers remained down for over a week, and a few days later the hackers deliver their first of many shocking dumps when the leak the Brad Pitt war drama Fury as well as unreleased studio titles including Annie, Mr. Turner, Still Alice and To Write Love On Her Arms online.

Speculation began to mount that North Korea was likely behind the hack, based on the fact that the country's UN ambassador Ja Song Nam wrote a letter to UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon taking issue that a film that depicts the assassination of a sitting world leader was allowed to be made, let alone released.

In December  the hackers ramped up their attacks, releasing the salaries of the company's top executives and the script for the new James Bond film.

They also made public the now-infamous set of emails between Sony co-chairman Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin.

In them, they mock President Obama, implying the President only liked movies with black actors and subject matter such as 12 Years a Slave. 

Rudin also makes a particularly vicious criticism of Angelina Jolie who he labels 'a minimally talented spoiled brat' in one email, and in another exchange actually removes her from  the chain in order to tell Pascal that the actress is 'out of her mind.' 

The pair later made public apologies for their comments.

Other emails revealed Pascal was keen for British actor Idris Elba to become the next James Bond, while one producer says of actor Michael Fassbender 'he makes you feel bad to have normal sized male genitalia.'

The cache of confidential documents leaked from Sony's archives also included the pseudonyms actors such as Daniel Craig, Natalie Portman and Jessica Alba used to check into hotels and book car services. 

The hacking group also starts dumping employee medical records, and most notably there letter on December 8 demanding that Sony stop the release of their upcoming Kim Jong-un assassination film The Interview.

On December 13 with the scandal at near fever pitch, the group announces plans for their upcoming 'Christmas gift' which they say will put Sony 'into the worst state.'

Then things go quiet until December 16, when the group follows up their demand by threatening a terrorist attack of any movie theater set to play The Interview when it is released on December 25.

It results in the four largest theater chains in the country announcing they will not show the film, and the following day Sony cancels the film's release.

But after facing fierce criticism for canceling the release, the studio was able to declare victory over their hackers by releasing The Interview online and in certain movie theaters.
