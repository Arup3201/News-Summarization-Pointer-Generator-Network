French detectives have reopened their investigation into the murder of a British student 22 years ago after a tip-off about a new suspect.

Joanna Parrish was raped, beaten and strangled before her body was left in a river in 1990.

The 20-year-old, who was teaching at a French school as part of her university course, had arranged to meet a man who had answered her newspaper advert offering private English lessons.

Mystery: Joanna Parrish (left) was found raped and strangled in a river in 1990.Â  The new investigation will probe convicted killer Michel Fourniret (right) and a new, unnamed, suspect

The investigation will re-examine 
evidence against serial killer Michel Fourniret as well as an unnamed 
new suspect, who is also a convicted murderer and sex attacker.

Yesterday Miss Parrish's father Roger, 68, said: 'We are very pleased. They said there are now two strands to the investigation.

'One is Michel Fourniret and his ex-wife and there are many questions to be answered about that.

Roger and Pauline Parrish are still fighting for justice, 22 years on

'I personally think that they are the strongest suspects. The new lead we don't know much about.

'All I know is that it is a man who is
serving a prison sentence for violent sexual crimes and in the 
investigations an informant told the police they suspected he was 
involved in Jo's murder.'

Fourniret, 69, was nicknamed the 
'Beast of the Ardennes' after he lured seven girls, aged between 12 and 
21, to remote spots before strangling, shooting or stabbing them. He was
convicted in 2008 and is serving life.

He had been near Auxerre when Jo, from Newnham on Severn, Gloucestershire, was murdered,

But attempts to try Fourniret 
floundered because incriminating evidence from his wife was extracted 
under duress and police lost vital DNA evidence.

The
Parrishes feared any chance of justice for their daughter was lost, but
they have been have been given fresh hope by the new development - 
thought to have been prompted by a tip-off.

The new suspect has not been named, but he is believed to be - like Fourniret - a convicted murderer.

The Parrish family's lawyer Didier Seban said: 'The court has now requested the judges to
reinvestigate all aspects of the case including the Fourniret lead and a
new lead which has just emerged.

'This lead concerns another man with a
long list of criminal convictions who has been denounced.

'Joanna's parents, who have often had the 
impression of being abandoned by the French justice system, have renewed
hope of finally seeing a result to the inquiry.'
