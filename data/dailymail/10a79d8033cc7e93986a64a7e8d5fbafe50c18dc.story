George Osborne humiliated his Liberal Democrat colleagues in the Coalition by dismissing their hopes for a mansion tax.

Labour frontbenchers mocked Nick Clegg, Vince Cable and Danny Alexander sitting alongside Mr Osborne as he described their plan as ‘intrusive’.

Mr Cable, the Lib Dems’ former Treasury spokesman and now Business Secretary, has been pushing for a mansion tax ever since gaining office.

The plan would see an annual levy of 1 per cent on homes worth more than
£2million – penalising pensioners who have lived in their house for 
years.

Earlier in the year, he was still arguing for the plan, saying: 
‘A mansion tax is still very much on the agenda – it is a very good 
idea.

‘It is good for two reasons. It would constitute a tax on wealth rather 
than income, which we believe to be right, and also in economic terms it
creates the right sort of incentives for the property market.’

But Mr Osborne revealed crushingly yesterday that Mr Cable had failed to argue the Lib Dem case in Cabinet.

He said it would require a huge revaluation of homes, and would raise 
little money anyway. ‘To make sure the deficit reduction remains fair, 
we need to raise more,’ he told MPs.

‘We’ve already raised stamp duty on
multi-million-pound homes and next week we will publish the legislation
to stop the richest avoiding stamp duty.

‘But we won’t introduce a new tax on property. This would require a revaluation of hundreds of thousands of pounds.

‘In my view it would be intrusive, expensive to levy, raise little and 
the temptation for future Chancellors to bring ever more homes into its 
net would be irresistible.’

The plan would see an annual levy on homes worth more than £2million like this one - penalising pensioners who have lived in their house for years

Mr Cable told Sky News he was disappointed to have lost the battle over a
mansion tax – but said it was part of a ‘very sensible compromise’.

‘The changes that have been introduced on pension tax are substantial,’ 
he said. 

‘There was a trade-off within the Coalition. The Liberal 
Democrats would clearly liked to have done much more in terms of the top
end of the scale of income and wealth; we reached a compromise with the
Conservatives on that.’
