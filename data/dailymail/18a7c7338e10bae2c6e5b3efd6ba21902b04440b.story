The U.S. military trainers handed the new recruit, Mohammad Ismail, his AK-47 to 
defend his remote Afghan village. He turned around and immediately used it, 
spraying the Americans with bullets and killing two - the latest of nine U.S. 
service personnel gunned down in two weeks by their supposed Afghan allies.

The shooting in western Farah province was not the only such 
attack Friday. Hours later a few provinces away in Kandahar, an Afghan soldier 
wounded two more coalition servicemen.

One turncoat attack per month raised eyebrows last year. One 
per week caused concern earlier this year. But when Afghan forces turn their 
guns on international trainers twice in a day - as they now have two weeks in a 
row - it's hard to argue there's not something going on. The question is, what 
is it?

Infiltration: Inside attacks on coalition forces in Afghanistan have risen from 11 in 2011 to 29 so far in 2012

The U.S.-led alliance says it's too soon to tell what's 
behind the rash of insider attacks. The most likely explanations: Either the 
Taliban are increasingly infiltrating the Afghan police and army, or relations 
between Afghan and American forces are turning toxic - or both.

'There's no positive spin on this,' said Andrew Exum, an 
analyst with the Washington-based Center for a New American Security who has 
advised the top U.S. generals in Kabul. He said the number of Afghan insider 
attacks has risen beyond what can be explained as isolated incidents.

That's bad news for the U.S. exit strategy for Afghanistan, 
which has seen Washington spend more than $20 billion on training and equipping 
a nearly 340,000-member Afghan security force on the assumption that it would 
eventually be strong enough to fight the Taliban on its own.

The coalition has downplayed the insider attacks as 
anomalies and mostly a result of personal grievances, even as their numbers 
soared from 11 last year to 29 so far in 2012. The alliance says only about 10 
per cent of the attacks were related to infiltration by the Taliban insurgency. 
But that analysis was done before the latest furious spate of seven attacks in 
11 days, a frequency that suggests some type of coordination.

U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta 
called the recent attacks 'sporadic' and not a long-term trend

'Whether or not these specific events turn out to be 
insurgent-initiated... we're just going to have to do the investigations and 
figure that out,' said Jamie Graybeal, a spokesman for the U.S.-led 
coalition.

The problem has become so pronounced in the Afghan war that 
all U.S. forces there are now being instructed to carry loaded weapons - even on 
base - as a precaution against insider attacks, a U.S. official said Friday in 
Washington. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because policy forbids 
discussing military procedures.

Some historians are hard-pressed to find precedent for this 
in previous wars.

'I have never heard of anything in Vietnam comparable to 
what we have recently experienced in Afghanistan,' said James McAllister, a 
political science professor at Williams College in Massachusetts who has written 
extensively about the Vietnam War.

A British military expert on colonial wars, 
Martin Windrow, said the level of these types of attacks were 'almost unheard 
of' in any conflict he'd studied.

Exum said the insider attacks have 'tremendous strategic 
impact' beyond the 36 coalition forces killed this year because they damage 
morale among international troops and further weaken support for the war in the 
U.S. and other NATO nations training Afghan soldiers and police to take over 
security nationwide by 2014.

What's unclear, he added, is how much influence the Taliban 
actually have in organizing the increasing numbers of attacks.

Discord: Afghan security personnel said in a May 2011 Army survey
they found U.S. troops 
'extremely arrogant, 
bullying and unwilling to 
listen'

The insurgents have been happy to take credit. The Taliban's 
supreme leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, boasted Thursday that the insurgents 'have 
cleverly infiltrated into the ranks of the enemy' and were killing a rising 
number of U.S.-led coalition forces.Â 

Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told The Associated Press in 
an interview this week that the attacks may reflect the Taliban's use of 
unconventional tactics against a coalition force it cannot defeat on the 
battlefield. He added that U.S. military commanders say such attacks still 
remain 'sporadic' and not a long-term trend.

'The enemy is infiltrating because 
they see it's very easy'

Friday's deadly shooting in Farah, at least by the accounts 
of local Afghan officials, seemed unlikely to be a personal dispute. Mohammad 
Ismail, a man in his 30s, had joined the Afghan Local Police just five days 
earlier. He opened fire during an inauguration ceremony attended by American and 
Afghan forces in Kinisk village, Farah provincial police chief Agha Noor Kemtoz 
said.

'As soon as they gave the weapon to Ismail to begin 
training, he took the gun and opened fire toward the U.S. soldiers,' Kemtoz 
said. The police chief added that he had warned U.S. forces organizing and 
training the community not to move too fast to recruit in the village, which he 
said is heavily influenced by the Taliban.

Vulnerable: Afghan military analyst Amrullah Amman says the Taliban is infiltrating Afghan security forces 'because they see it's very easy'

Afghan military analyst Amrullah Amman has no doubt that 
Taliban infiltration of Afghan security forces is rising. He said that despite 
new methods of screening, it's simple to forge documents and invent references 
in Afghanistan.

'The gate is wide open. The enemy is infiltrating because 
they see it's very easy,' Amman said.

But the turncoat attacks may also reflect growing mistrust 
and resentment among Afghans working with international forces.

Afghan soldiers interviewed by the AP earlier this year 
offered their own explanations: The Afghans feel disrespected, the soldiers 
said. They complained of getting inferior equipment and condescending treatment 
by Americans.

In May 2011, a U.S. Army team led by a behavioral scientist 
compiled a survey that indicated many Afghan security personnel found U.S. 
troops 'extremely arrogant, bullying and unwilling to listen to their 
advice.'

'I think infiltration is easier to address, actually,' Exum 
said. 'I think the worse thing is, if your entire strategy going forward from 
the next three or four years depends on partnering with Afghan forces, then if 
relations have already devolved to this degree, you're really worried.'

The U.N. Security Council late Friday strongly condemned 
coordinated terrorist attacks in various parts of the country on Tuesday and 
Wednesday and reiterated its serious concern 'at threats posed by the Taliban, 
al-Qaida and illegal armed groups to the local population, national security 
forces, international military and international assistance efforts in 
Afghanistan.'
