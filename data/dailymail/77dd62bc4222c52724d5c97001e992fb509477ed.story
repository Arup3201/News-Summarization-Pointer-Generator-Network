Gannaro Gattuso has admitted he wants to be the next manager of Rangers after the Ibrox club finally confirmed Ally McCoist is working a 12-month notice period.

The Italian World Cup winner spent a short spell in Glasgow in the late 1990s as a teenager before moving on to Salernitana then AC Milan.

The 36-year-old revealed: ‘My wife is from Glasgow but the main reason to want to go there is because Rangers is a big team with big stories.

‘Believe me, the priority would not be my family. It would be the job and the chance to work for a big club which is in my heart. There are many reasons, not just my family.’

Currently in charge of OFI Crete, Gattuso claims he tried to quit the Greek side in October because he felt his players didn’t believe in him but changed his mind 24 hours later after talks with fans. The Heraklion-based side currently lies a lowly 15th in the Super League after a 2-0 defeat at Panionios on Sunday.

‘Two years ago I started as a manager at Sion and now I am carrying on my time in football in Heraklion,’ he continued.

Rangers confirmed on Monday that manager Ally McCoist had resigned from the club

‘My situation at Crete is not simple. I wanted to leave but the fans would not let me go and that is okay.

‘I only played for a year and a half at Rangers but it was a big pleasure to do that so, of course, I would be interested in the job there.’

Gattuso is thought to be one of a few options the Ibrox board is considering.

McCoist tendered his resignation on Thursday, although the news was leaked just a few hours before a 2-0 defeat to Queen of the South on Friday night.

After three days of silence in Govan, the club confirmed the move in a statement to the London Stock Exchange on Monday morning.
