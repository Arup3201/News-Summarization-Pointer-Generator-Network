A Turkish man accused of helping ISIS militants smuggle jihadis into Syria has also been charged with forcing Syrian refugee children into joining his paedophile prostitution ring, it has been claimed.

Turkish investigators examining the links between Ahmet Yumuşak and the terror group are said to have discovered the 29-year-old talking with potential clients about the price of sex with refugees.

He allegedly recommended certain women to his 'customers', who were inquiring about paying for sex with young females fleeing the Syrian warzone for what they had believed to be the safety of Yumuşak's native Hatay region of southern Turkey.

Yumuşak's alleged crimes came to light after local detectives launched an investigation into an attack by Islamic State militants on police officers in the Turkish town of Niğde in March last year.

11 people, including Yumuşak, have already been charged in connection with that attack, according to Turkish newspaper Hürriyet.

Investigating officers using wiretaps to investigate the case are said to have caught Yumuşak arranging for vulnerable Syrian refugee women to have sex with 'customers', even going as far as to make personal recommendations, saying: 'the 16-year-old one is terrific'.

The alleged people smuggler has since been charged with forcing underage girls into prostitution.

Another suspect in the case, named as Ayhan Orli, is accused of using his contacts in Hatay to procure 50 kg of aluminium powder, which can be used to make explosives. 

According to the charge, a local police officer then cooperated with Orli to smuggle the powder over the border into Syria, where it was handed over to members of the militant group Ahrar ash-Sham.

Terror group: Currently the majority of would-be jihadis travel to the Turkish border town of Akcakale, where people smugglers help them make the short journey to ISIS' Syrian stronghold Raqqa (pictured)

NATO member state Turkey has long been accused of not doing enough to stem the flow of Western would-be jihadis arriving in the south of the country. 

Currently the majority travel to the Turkish border town of Akcakale, where people smugglers  help them make the short journey into Syria, where they are met by militants in ISIS-held Tell Abiad.

From Tell Abiad the terror group's de facto capital Raqqa is just a 60 mile journey along Highway 6. 

Last month three schoolgirls from Bethnal Green are believed to made that exact journey, having first arrived in Turkey on a direct flight from London to Istanbul.

Scotland Yard was facing questions over how the girls – Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, centre, and a 15-year-old German girl - were able to board a flight to Turkey unchallenged, despite having no parent or guardian with them.

Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria have thrown yet another young man  to his death from a building after accusing him of being gay.

Stomach-churning photographs show a large bloodthirsty crowd gathered at the foot of a multi-storey building in the group's de facto capital Raqqa to watch the murder of the young victim.

With the baying crowd clambering on to rooftops to get a better view of the savage scene, the blindfolded man is dragged to the roof of the tallest building in the neighbourhood by bearded militants, who use mobile phones to film him being barbarically thrown to his death.

The images were released by local activist group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, who work undercover in the ISIS stronghold to expose the terror group's atrocities. 

The photographs carry the distinctive yellow logo of ISIS' propaganda wing Al Hayat Media Centre, suggesting they come from an as-yet unreleased video of the savage murder.

The photographs shows a huge crowd gathering at the foot of a run-down building in the west of the city, which ISIS captured in early 2014 amid the ongoing chaos of the Syrian Civil War.

So many people are seen in the streets to watch the man being thrown to his death that vehicles are unable to pass along the streets, although it appears the militants have erected metal railings to keep the crowds in line, giving a chilling sense of order to the savagery. 

The blindfolded victim - who is understood to be in his 20s - is seen being dragged to the top of the building by three black-masked militants while two armed but undisguised fighters stand at their side using mobile phones to film the gruesome murder.

The next image shows the man plunging to his death, falling face first from behind a white metal railing towards the ground several stories below.
