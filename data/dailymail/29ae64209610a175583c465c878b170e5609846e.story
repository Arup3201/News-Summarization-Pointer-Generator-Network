A mother-of-four has hit out at a family court after her ex-husband shot and killed her new partner before shooting himself in front of their children in an incident she says could have been avoided.

Amy Kroening has said she warned a Kenton Family Court about her ex-husband Zuriel Turk's threatening behaviour before the shooting last month.

Her new husband Mark Kroening had taken her four children, aged ten to 15, to see their father last month when police say Turk fired a gun into the car before shooting himself.

In a call from an emergency phone given to her children, Amy Kroening heard one of them cry:Â  'Mommy, Daddy shot Mark.'

Mark Kroening and Turk were both killed in the incident at the Dairy Queen, in Latonia, which Amy Kroening believes could have been avoided. None of the children in the car were injured.

She has criticised a family court judge who was asked by the children's guardian ad litem to temporarily suspend Turk's parental visits, after an audio recording emerged of Turk telling his children he would commit suicide if he did not get custody, the Cincinnati Enquirer has reported.

The judge however ordered supervised visits, with Turk able to nominate his own supervisor.

Speaking to Local 12 WKRC Cincinnati, Kroening said she had warned the courts her ex-husband had written threatening letters to her family.

She said there are 'two folders of court documents stating how afraid I was of this man.'

She said: 'I think after all the warnings
 I gave them and all the warnings he gave them, they completely failed 
my husband, Mark Kroening. They failed all of us.'

In 2006, police charged Turk with sexual abuse, but he was later found not guilty by a jury.

Earlier this year, Turk filed a lawsuit against a number of people, including the judge and his ex-wife and new husband.

He also filed a motion of domestic violence against Mark Kroening.

The motion, which alleged Kroening had threatened to shoot Turk, was dismissed by the court.

A month later the judge was asked to suspend Turk's custody visits with his children.

According to officials cited by Local 12 WKRC, Turk wrote on his blog about the difficulties of being separated from his children about a week before the shooting.

According to fox19.com, Amy Kroening and Turk were married for nine years, while she was married to Mark Kroening for just 53 weeks.
