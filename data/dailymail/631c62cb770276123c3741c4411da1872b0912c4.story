Sunbathers would not let a long winter stop them from hitting the beach in Minnesota even though the lake hasn't even melted yet.

The banks of Lake Superior were speckled with barely-clothed sunbathers on Memorial Day just like the lake was sprinkled with mini-icebergs.

Even though temperatures were in the 80s this weekend, that hasn't automatically melted the remaining ice.

Not a normal dip in the lake: Melissa Ellis and Brigitta Keyler are 'native Duluthians' and regularly sunbathe on the banks of Lake Superior but even though it was warm enough to tan the mini icebergs remained

Quite the contrast: Eager sunbathers took to the shores of Lake Superior in Minnesota and Michigan over Memorial Day weekend even though the lake itself was very icy

USA Today reports that the south shore of the lake, near Marquette, Michigan still had plenty of ice near the shore.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates that nearly 5 per cent of the lake is still covered in ice.

The situation led to plenty of unusual photo opportunities, with bikini-clad beachgoers posing on top of patches of ice on the sun-filled day, as captured by local station WCCO.

One such brave sun-seeker was Ben Ellison who went to the shores near Duluth, Minnesota this weekend.

'It's been a goofy year weather-wise, but it is finally feeling summer-ish now!' he told MailOnline.

Not a cloud in the sky: The air temperature was in the 80s but far from it in the water

Warmer than it looks: The ice is seen across the lake but, given its size, the ice only comprises of 5 per cent

Other options: Ms Baer's friend Ben Ellison opted for sports sandals when he went venturing on the ice, which still covers an estimated 5 per cent of the lake
