Zlatan Ibrahimovic will miss Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League showdown with Barcelona on Tuesday because of a heel injury.

The French champions announced in a statement that the Sweden star, who has missed the last two Ligue 1 games, has not fully recovered from the left heel problem and is out of the clash with his former club.

PSG examined the striker's foot on Monday morning but were not satisfied he was fit enough to face Barca.

The Swedish striker has already missed two matches and isn't fit enough tor return against Barcelona

Ibrahimovic last played for PSG on September 21 in their 1-1 home draw with Lyon and has since missed the 2-0 win at Caen and the 1-1 draw with Toulouse.

Paris collected one point on the first Group F matchday away to Ajax while opponents Barcelona beat APOEL Nicosia 1-0.

Ibrahimovic spent the 2009-2010 season at Barcelona, scoring 21 times in 45 matches but he didn't get on with manager Pep Guardiola and left for AC Milan. 

Worryingly, for PSG, they have only won 40 per cent of matches when Ibrahimovic hasn't played.

The French side are already without another star man in Ezequiel Lavezzi, who suffered a hamstring tear in the Caen match and will be out for three weeks.
