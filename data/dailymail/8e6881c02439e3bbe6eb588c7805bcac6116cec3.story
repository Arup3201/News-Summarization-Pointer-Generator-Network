Variety Magazine has announced their round up of this year's Power of Women honorees, all of whom grace their own covers for the May split-release issue.

Actresses Sarah Jessica Parker, Claire Danes, Susan Sarandon, model Iman, Broadway star Idina Menzel, and CEO of A+E networks Nancy Dubuc, all front the covers in a series of elegantly shot black and white photos.

The eclectic array of philanthropists are all being publicly recognized by Variety for their individual humanitarian efforts this year.

Pensive: Clare Danes joins a host of A-List philanthropists who are honored for Variety Magazine's 2014 Women of Power

Actress and fashion icon Sarah Jessica Parker is being commended for her plans to inject a 'modern, fresh feeling' into the long-established New York City Ballet.

The 49-year-old Sex and the City star is trained in ballet herself, and has been working with the company for almost 20 years, revealing she has had 'a lifelong admiration' for dance'.

'It’s important to us as people, as Americans, to allow ourselves to appreciate the art form,' she explains to the publication.

Also well-versed in the world of fashion,
 Ms Jessica Parker recently invited Valentino, and a number of new, 
up-and-coming designers to create costumes for ballet performances in 
order to shine a different light on the art.

And last November, she produced an AOL Originals documentary, which took viewers behind the scenes of the New York City Ballet - a sacred backstage area which until then had banned cameras.

'It’s about understanding a dancer’s life, and helping people who thought it was this rarefied art form understand that it’s athletic, coupled with extraordinary artistry,' she says.

Homeland 
star Claire Danes, 34, has thrown her support behind Afghan Hands, which 
helps Afghan women who have lost their husbands put their lives back 
together.

'My
 parents are artists, and one of our friends spent the 1980s going to 
Afghanistan and taking photographs of the women there,' she says. 'I’ve 
been affected by these images my whole life.'

Oscar-winning actress Susan Sarandon is well known for her dedication to helping others, and this year she has focused on a school in Uganda, Africa called Hope North

Afghan hands was founded in 2009, and puts widows in Afghanistan to work embroidering scarves and pillows, to raise money so they can rebuild their financial and emotional independence. 

'Widows are
 basically beholden to their in-laws, and after the death of their 
husbands they’re seen as a burden,' Ms Danes explains.

She
 was first made aware of the charity by her make-up artist Matin 
Maulawizada, who co-founded the organization. 'I started collecting the 
scarves pretty aggressively,' she says, adding that she is 'passionate' 
about every aspect of their mission.

Much
 as she would like to travel to Afghanistan to lend her support on the 
ground, it's still too dangerous for her to do so. 'It’s going to 
happen, though - it’s just a matter of time,' she vows.

Timeless beauty: Supermodel Iman is dedicated to the Dr Hawa Abdi foundation, which helps educate Somalian women. 'I always believed that the future of Africa is in the women,' she says

Oscar-winning actress Susan Sarandon is well-known for her dedication to
 helping others, and has been involved in a number of wide-spanning 
charities over the years.

Currently, she has her sights on Hope 
North, which assists the youngest victims of Uganda’s civil war in 
getting an education, in the form of a secondary school there.

'We’re working to keep this school afloat,' she says. Ms
 Sarandon, 67, insists that although she is 'spread pretty thin' when it 
comes to her humanitarian work, the organizations she lends time to are 
ones she can truly 'vouch for.'

'I’m in a business that leads to empathy, which leads to action,' she says. 'Having
 the ability to constantly re-frame perspective for people - that’s when 
things get interesting, because it leads to dialogue.'

Broadway star: Idina Menzel has started a summer camp in Massachusetts for young girls who need to 'find their voice'

Somalian-born supermodel Iman, 58, takes her humanitarian role very 
seriously. She and her family were forced to flee their home in Somalia back in the 
Seventies, and walk to Kenya when Africa's bitter civil war broke out.

She was later discovered by photographer Peter Beard while in Nairobi, and the rest is fashion history.

Iman,
 who is married to musician David Bowie, in an avid supporter of the Dr 
Hawa Abdi foundation - a small charity which runs hospitals and schools 
in Somalia.

'It’s a small foundation, on the ground, with people
 who making lasting changes rather than big foundations that make a lot 
of noise,' she says.

Hard working: CEO of A+E networks, Nancy Dubac, is devoted to America's veterans, and is backing two support charities, Team Rubicon and The Mission Continues

The foundation is particularity concerned 
with educating young girls, who wouldn't otherwise get the opportunity. 
'I always believed that future of Africa is in the women,' she says.

And closer to home, Broadway star Idina Menzel started A Broader Way; a summer camp held in Massachusetts for girls from urban communities, which gives them a place to express themselves in the form of songs, poems, writing and stagecraft.

 the ability to constantly re-frame perspective for people - that’s when 
things get interesting, because it leads to dialogue

'I loved being able to reinvent myself during the summer, and not be judged by the same group of kids I saw in school,' says Ms Menzel, who started the company with her husband from whom she is now separated.

Along with other stage veterans, Ms Menzel attends the 10-day camp herself, which helps a group of 60 young girls 'find their own voice' and build their self-confidence.

'There’s a beautiful intimacy about the camp. These girls get to be the authors of their own life,' she says.

Last but not least, Nancy Dubac, CEO of A+E networks, has turned her efforts to support two veteran support charities, Team Rubicon and The Mission Continues, both of which help veterans transition back into their local communities.

Both Ms Dubac's grandparents served in the Pacific in World War II, so it's a cause close to her heart.

'Veterans issues have always spoken to me,' she says. 'These men and women have served our country, and this is a way to honor their legacy and hopefully inspire others to do so as well.'

All the A-List honoree's will be attending a glitterati-packed power lunch in New York city on Friday.
