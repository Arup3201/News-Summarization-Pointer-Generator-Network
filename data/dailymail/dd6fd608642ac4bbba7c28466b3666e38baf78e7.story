Ed Miliband is making 'unforced errors' that are leaving Labour 'in difficulty', a senior MP warned last night.

Tom Watson, who was Labour's deputy chairman until last year, said Mr Miliband's controversial decision to pose for pictures holding a copy of the Sun newspaper last week was a 'serious mistake' that had damaged the party, particularly on Merseyside.

He hit out at the Labour leaders aides, saying that members of the Shadow cabinet were 'worried' about the performance of the team paid to advise him, following a series of recent errors, such as failing to identify the Labour leader while campaigning in the town, and having embarrassing photographs taken while trying to eat a bacon sandwich.

Mr Miliband, who boasted of standing up to Rupert Murdoch during the phone-hacking scandal, attempted to mend fences with the media mogul in the run-up to the next election by posing with a World Cup souvenir edition of the Sun newspaper.

He was forced to apologise for the decision less than 24 hours later following a ferocious backlash from his own MPs, shadow ministers and activists, and the resignation of a councillor in Liverpool where many people still boycott the newspaper in protest at its coverage of the Hillsborough disaster.

Former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott also criticised the decision â€“ and said Mr Miliband should take responsibility for it himself.

He told Sky News: 'I wouldn't do it, right, but the leader has to make a judgement about many things. His judgement was, on balance, to do what he did. No doubt advisers give advice, but you can't keep blaming advisers.

'At the end of the day, the leader must make a judgement, and he'll be judged on his judgements. I wouldn't have done it.'

But Mr Watson said Mr Miliband's media advisers were making 'elementary blunders' and should be sacked unless they can 'lift their game'.

He told BBC Radio Five's Pienaar's Politics show that the Labour leader was 'very badly advised' to pose for the Sun picture.

'It was his ultimate responsibility to do it but I just cannot believe that the paper ended up his office and someone ended up taking a photograph of him and it ended up of the internet,' he said.

'The people around Ed, you know, they're not Civil Servants. They are very powerful political people. They carry a lot of power in the Labour Party.

'A lot of Labour Party members raise funds to pay their very good salaries. And to make such elementary blunders like this - in the week that the Hillsborough inquests were taking place - I think is a problem and I'm sure there will be a lot of Shadow Cabinet members who are sort of holding their counsel on this but they are worried about the way Ed's office operates.

'They've either got to sort of lift their games or move on and get people who can do the job, in my view.'
