When Ollie the Weimaraner realised the dog's life was not for him, he ditched the soggy food and uncomfortable baskets for ice cream and his owners' bed.

Now the two-year-old dog lives the life of a human, taking showers and  sleeping beside his owners Mel Stokes, 39, and Eliot Alexander, 38, at their home in Forest Hall, North Tyneside.

The pet also enjoys a bowl of Sugar Puffs and will indulge in a cup of tea for breakfast.

Breakfast: Ollie, who is 4ft tall on his hind legs and weighs six-and-a-half stone dips his tongue into a cup-of-tea

Dessert: Ollie runs past all the children waiting at the Mr Whippy van so he can get his ice cream, which his owners have pre-paid for

The animal, who is 4ft tall on his hind 
legs and weighs six-and-a-half stone, also 'goes mad' when he hears the 
Benny Hill Theme tune coming from the Mr Whippy ice cream van on the 
street outside.

The pet then runs outside and skips passed all the children to the front of the queue so he can get his very own ice cream.

Ollie has become such a regular customer, his owners have had to start paying for his 50p cold treats up front.

Because of his independent lifestyle, his the couple have even considered getting him a wallet to keep around his neck.

The couple, who also have two cats, think he has taken over the house and say he has 'no manners'.

IT consultant Mr Alexander told The Daily Mirror: 'I take him out every day. When we come back, he just walks into the shower.

'He’s not a dog , he’s more like a human.'

Roll over: After a long day on the beach, the dog clambers into bed with his owner Eliot Alexander
