An injured cuckoo who was flown business class to Italy to catch up with her migration trip has now completed an emotional release back into the wild.

Idemili, a two-year-old cuckoo,  set off for her epic migration from 
Brechfa Forest in Carmarthenshire, Wales, with four male companions  but 
soon found herself in trouble.

She made it only as far as Tolworth in
Surrey, where she was discovered the worse for wear in a garden, 
malnourished and emaciated and unable to carry her GPS tag which allows scientists to track her movements.

Comfortable: Idemili was flown to Italy by British Airways to continue her epic journey

But after a month of care at the 
Wildlife Aid Centre in nearby Leatherhead, she was flown to Italy by 
British Airways to continue her epic journey, crossing the Mediterranean and 
then the Sahara desert before finally arriving in the Congo.

Cuckoos tend to leave England during 
July or early August.

Idemili was travelling in her own seat – a
business class one would have cost £379 if booked this month – and was 
accompanied on the flight from Gatwick by vet nurse Lucy Kells from 
Wildlife Aid.

Only the best: The cuckoo had to go through security and even had a taste of the business class lounge

Almost immediately after releasing her
the cuckoo called back to her travel partner - a touching moment which 
provoked a flood of tears.

Ms
Kells said: 'All through the build up to Idemili’s flight and release I
was so nervous, I just thought ‘something is going to go wrong’.

'But British Airways were amazing and everybody at the airport knew what was going on when we arrived.

'We went through the security and whizzed straight through to our business class lounge - something I’ve never experienced before.

'We didn’t have to queue to get onto the plane either - in fact everyone parted to let us through - we were treated like royalty, it was surreal.

'Idemili was very brave throughout the flight, she actually slept the whole way and it was me that was constantly leaning over to see if she was OK.

'She is such an awesome bird and a real calm character.'

The pair touched down in Turin and 
were greeted by two University of Turin students, Dan Chamberlain and 
Enrico Caprio, who had helped organise Idemili’s release.

She was let off into the wild from the Association Center for Storks in Racconigi near Turin.

The plan was to release the Idemili the day after arriving but Ms Kells  felt it was in the bird’s best interests to do it sooner rather than later.

And as the Association Centre had heard the call of a nearby cuckoo very recently, it was agreed to release that same day.

Ms Kells added:
'I am so grateful to Dan and Enrico, they knew exactly what the best 
release site was for Idemili - it was a gorgeous place.

'Actually letting her go was very 
emotional as I had got quite attached to her - there were a few tears 
shed, but it was happy crying.

'I think the sudden realisation set in that I would probably never see her again, but it was a moving experience.

'She
didn’t fly straight off but instead went and sat pruning herself in a 
tree for about half an hour and feasted on the many caterpillars on the 
tree.

'She then called back to me which was incredible as I had never heard her make a sound in the month that I’ve known her.

'It was a real goose-bump moment but it was at that point when all my previous concerns disappeared.

'Part of me, selfishly, would love to know how she gets on but she is not tagged now and of course I know that is for the best.

'It was a hell of a privilege to have dealt with Idemili because in 21 years of being a vet nurse she is the first cuckoo I have seen.

'To come back without her felt really strange but it was certainly an experience I shall never forget.'

She was not flown straight to Africa because at this stage of her migration it is too early.
