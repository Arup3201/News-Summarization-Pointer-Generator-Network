One by one, they take their turn in front of the camera; flaunting a red shirt, striking a pose, striving for a smile which smacks of pride. Some are familiar, others are little more than rumours, but each comes with the personal endorsement of Brendan Rodgers, and their collective cost is stratospheric.

When finally they are gathered together in one place, they will put on those red shirts and call themselves ‘Liverpool’.

So let’s hear it for Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren, Lazar Markovic, Divock Origi, Emre Can, and, if terms can be settled, Alberto Moreno and Javier Manquillo.

Summer arrival: Rickie Lambert left Southampton to join his boyhood club Liverpool after a brilliant season

Now some of those names will be familiar. You may recall that Southampton enjoyed a rather successful season; so successful, in fact, that Rodgers decided to buy them. 

He may have missed out on one or two players, but in Lambert, Lallana and Lovren he purchased the heart and soul of a club which was embarrassingly eager to sell hearts, souls and practically anything else which could be converted into cash.

Some of the others do not trip off the tongue. Emre Can, whose surname is destined to inspire a thousand predictable headlines, is a 20-year-old, bought from Bayer Leverkusen for £10 million. 

Markovic, also 20, cost £20m from Benfica, and Origi came from Lille for £10m. It would be unfair to suggest that his talents are not widely renowned, but the official Liverpool FC website is carrying a feature called ‘The Divock Origi Story’. It runs for 57 seconds.

Potential: Divock Origi joined the Merseyside club after a couple of impressive showings at the World Cup

International: Origi, centre, helped Belgium advance to the last-16 of the tournament in Brazil

Still, Rodgers, their manager, believes that Can is ‘exciting’, Markovic is ‘really exciting’, while Origi has the potential to become ‘world-class’. In any case, in the moment that shirt is pulled over their heads, they will instantly become heirs to the legacy of Keegan, Hansen and St John, celebrated in song and in story, revered legends of the Kop. 

For they are Liverpool’s summer signings, the best that £100m can buy.

Now, in a league which contains the two Manchester clubs, along with the likes of Chelsea and Spurs, it may seem unfair to concentrate on Liverpool’s spending. In a relatively short spell as a Premier League manager, Rodgers has espoused civilised principles and created teams who play with flair and invention.

His methods have been admirably supported by fans and board alike. In a fairer world, the club might well be entering the new season as defending champions. So we can have no quarrel with Liverpool.

Graceful: Brendan Rodgers has been effusive in his praise of Lazar Markovic, right, since he joined the club

No, it is the system which makes us uncomfortable. When Barcelona offered Liverpool £75m for Luis Suarez, Rodgers — if dear Luis will forgive the phrase — bit their hands off. But with that £75m burning a hole in their pockets, what did they decided to do? For instance, did they even briefly consider lowering admission prices to make Anfield more accessible to hard-pressed followers?

Not at all. They did what every other club does. They spent it; further enriching a flock of wealthy young men, a gaggle of grasping owners, and a plague of parasitical agents. It all felt a touch knee-jerk, automatic, the kind of thing that long ago Pools winners used to do when the man from Littlewoods came knocking. I spend, therefore I am.

Naturally, the chosen ones were at pains to declare their loyalty. Lovren described his move as ‘a dream come true’, while Lambert announced: ‘This means everything to me.’ Moreno and Manquillo have yet to effuse but Rodgers himself set the gold standard for gush when he referred to Lallana as ‘a great human being’.

Of course, all managers feel obliged to hurl superlatives at their acquisitions, in the knowledge that they will be judged by the players they have bought. I daresay that Graeme Souness paid fulsome tribute to the silken touch of Neil ‘Razor’ Ruddock and Julian Dicks when he flourished Liverpool’s chequebook in that long-distant winter.

But the description of Lallana seems a little excessive, even if you have just laid out £25m for his services.

In the midst of all this conspicuous consumption, Jordan Henderson said something interesting. Interviewed on Liverpool’s pre-season tour of America, the England midfield player declared his determination to ‘carry on from last season. To keep learning from the people around me, keep getting better all the time’.

Stuck in the middle: Jordan Henderson, one of Liverpool's stars last year, could find himself pushed out

Smiling now: Steven Gerrard led Liverpool to within a few points of the title last season

He added: ‘We can take a lot of confidence from last season because we played so much good football. We went on such a long, unbeaten run ... we were so close to winning the league.’

Indeed they were. Suarez was a huge factor, of course, but so too were names such as Gerrard, Sturridge, Sterling, Flanagan, Skrtel, Coutinho and Henderson himself.

They now enter a new season knowing their manager thinks there was nothing much wrong last time that six or seven vastly expensive new players won’t fix in the months ahead. A gesture of faith in the old guard would have been certainly cheaper and possibly more effective.

Incidentally, Brendan Rodgers is reported to be in the market for a new striker. Inevitably costly, hopefully a great human being.

 

With perfect wrist action, subtle Moeen Ali made his point

When the Test was won and the series was squared, Moeen Ali found himself at the centre of attention. Six Indian wickets had secured him the spotlight, and while he did not relish the fuss, he fulfilled his duties with appealing grace.

The noises off were fascinating. Andrew Strauss, having earlier described Moeen as a ‘part-time spin bowler’, was hurriedly reclassifying. The selectors were congratulating each other on their perspicacity and the English public was celebrating the pivotal part which Moeen had played in a rare and precious victory.

Moeen wore the air of a man enjoying a private joke, the way he had reacted three days earlier when the world was staring at his wrist. He knew precisely what convulsions he would cause by walking out to play for England while wearing wristbands which bore the slogans ‘Save Gaza’ and ‘Free Palestine’. 

Steve Harmison, the former England bowler, announced that Moeen had been ‘a silly boy’ and patronisingly informed him that sport and politics do not mix. Some of us recalled the sentiment from the days of cricket’s apartheid tours and it was as fatuous then as it is now.

More interestingly, the ECB declined to ban the bands, on the grounds that they were not a political slogan but a humanitarian statement and by the time the ICC eventually forbade the wearing of such adornments, Moeen had made his point and had tapped into the widespread sympathy for his cause.

The entire operation was conducted with the finesse of a diplomat and the fact that the wristbands were quietly set aside next day only enhanced the subtlety of his argument.

Of course, there are those who may never be completely reconciled to the sight of a man with a beard as bushy as WG Grace representing England. Mercifully, their numbers are few and are swiftly diminishing. For the fact remains that, in the space of a single week, Moeen Ali has won a reputation which far outstrips his wicket-taking or run-making abilities.

These are early days, but one suspects that before his career is done this formidable British Muslim may well emerge as one of the most significant figures in English sport.
