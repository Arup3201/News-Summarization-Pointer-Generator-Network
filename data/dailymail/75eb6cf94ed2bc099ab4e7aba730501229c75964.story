Heroic commuters saved a drunken soon-to-be doctor who stumbled onto the tracks as they waited for a train at a Boston subway station Wednesday night.

A dramatic Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority video shows the frightening moment the unnamed 33-year-old Malden man walked straight off the platform and onto the tracks, landing on his side.

Panic ensued among the amassed passengers, who were waiting for an Orange Line train at North Station at around 9 p.m.

Heroes: Three commuters, pictured, jumped into the tracks to lift the drunk man to safety

The concerned Bostonians are seen in the surveillance footage, which was uploaded on YouTube, waving down staff to help them get the man out of the path of any oncoming trains.

But, recognizing a train could be approaching at any point, three subway riders decided to take the man's life into their own hands.

Bravely, the trio jumped down onto the tracks and lifted the man to safety.

One even came from the opposite platform to help prevent the man from being struck and killed by an oncoming train.

According to a report from a responding officer, the man said he had two drinks to celebrate passing the medical boards and was waiting for a train home, but doesn't remember anything else.

The officer wrote that the man was covered in dirt and confused afterward, Fox News reported.

He was, however, taken to a hospital for a check up.

Saved: A third commuter, from the opposite platform, assisted the others to lift the man to safety before hopping up themselves. He was later taken to hospital but had no serious injuries

MTBA spokesman Joe Pesaturo said a dispatcher was notified of a person on the tracks and trains in the area were stopped so the man was never in danger.

Pesaturo added that the man was alert and had no visible injuries when he was pulled back onto the platform. But he was taken to hospital for observation anyway.

The spokesman urged subway riders to stay behind the yellow lines on platform edges.
