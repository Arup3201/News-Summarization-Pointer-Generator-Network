He is fashion's lifelong enfant terrible who created that iconic conical bra for Madonna.

And now Jean Paul Gaultier is being honoured with the first major exhibition dedicated to his work in his 40-year career.

The Fashion World of Jean Paul Gaultier 
From the Sidewalk to the Catwalk is being held in London's Barbican 
Centre, and displays some of his most controversial pieces for stars 
such as Beyoncé, Kylie, and Beth Ditto.

Last night Jean Paul Gaultier opened the doors to his new exhibition at the Barbican

Unveiling the exhibition today, the iconic couturier said it was an 'honour' to exhibit in the city of 'Eurotrash and punk' that has inspired him for so many years.

The designer said gratefully that the British capital embraced his controversial designs from the outset: 'London loved it, Paris didn't give a sh**.

'In Britain you say it is "no sex we are English" but that is so not true. It is almost the opposite in fact.'

Seated in a wheeled armchair - one of his 
own creations - the 61-year-old spun around on stage as he 
discussed his work.

He described discovering corsets with his grandmother as a child.

The designer has created outfits for some of world's most famous celebrities, including the late Amy Winehouse - one of her ensembles, pictured far right

'I was going to my grandmother's more and more. She was a faith healer. She was making beauty masks and doing tarots. She was telling me the same thing - "you will have a good life and be loved".

'She would tell women to change their hair for their husbands, it made me think how you can change the way you look.

'One
 time I was there on my own and saw a corset. And she told me she was 
wearing it, during last century, and she told me she drank vinegar to 
contract her stomach to make her waist teeny. It was quite dramatic. 
Twenty years later I made a dress like that, because of that.'

Gaultier became interested in corsets at a young age because his grandmother wore them often

The conical bra became one of the designer's signature creations

At school, while the other boys played football, he drew sketches of women in fishnet tights.

'My teacher made me put my hand out 
and hit me, she then pinned the sketch on my back and made me parade 
around the class. She wanted to humiliate me. But in the end, all the 
boys were saying "can you do a sketch for me!".

'It
 showed me that it could be a passport and it could open doors and 
people could love me. So I went on to sketch and sketch and sketch and 
then made clothes.'

His schoolboy dream led him to become a catwalk pioneer, introducing latex and S&M to the world of high fashion.

Jean Paul Gaultier originally rejected the idea of an exhibition as he wasn't sure if fashion would work in a museum

The designs on show trace the evolution of Gaultier's glittering  40-year career

The designer has always been a fan of Great Britan and invited a Queen Elizabeth look-a-like to the opening last night

Known for being inspired by strong female muses, including Madonna and Beth Ditto, Gaultier says he set out to change the image of women as passive, subservient characters.

He said: 'I always found it strange that models were told to be beautiful and shut up. I find that very scandalous. I like girls to speak during the show, not to be a robot, to express themselves.

'Women were just seen as a sex object. I wanted them to express and I wanted a man to be a sex object too.'

Jean Paul Gaultier says he was sick of women just being sex objects and that he wanted his models to express themselves on the catwalk and in photographs

Despite his extravagant creations, Gaultier has gained a wide celebrity following, from Madonna to Sarah Jessica Parker

He jokingly added: 'I think that's happened now as you get so many cougars...'

The controversial fashion genius originally rejected the idea of an exhibition.

He said: 'At first I didn't want it because a museum is for when you are dead. And I didn't think it would work in a museum, fashion.'

But once he got on board, he applied his notorious inventiveness to develop an original and fascinating show.

Gaultier's classic nautical stripe also appears regularly throughout the exhibition

Fashion today has been swept by a wave of androgyny, with girls swapping heels for trainers, dresses for boyfriend jeans.

'I have nothing against that. On the contrary, I think it is good to have it.

'Even if it looks the opposite, I am a minimalist. And also the opposite. You have to be creative with a simple thing to make an effect.

'But I try to make novelty out of things I like. To be honest, I don't think I can follow the trends. People copy each other, I don't think I can do that. For me, if you propose a different thing you can attract other people. If you are creating the same outfit as everyone else people will just say "why you"?'

Sex and bondage are regular themes in the designer's work

The exhibition will open to the public tomorrow and run until August this year

The designer, who was heavily influenced by London's dandies, punks and Eurotrash, said he has waited years to look back on his history with the city.

He said: 'This show is like an homage to everything I love about London.

'I am super excited that the show is coming to London for two reasons. The first reason is that I always want to go to London, because London, for me, is a special place.

'In England I've got so many memories and I've had so many experiences and the English were the first ones to come to my shows and appreciate my fashion.

The designer was joined by many celebrities at the exhibition's launch last night, including the heavily pregnant model Erin O'Connor, pictured here

'I like the spirit, the humour and little adventures that were funny, like Eurotrash.

'I am very proud to show it to you. Even though I am a frog, I hope you enjoy it!'

What's next? He doesn't know: 'I think I'm very lucky.

'I did fashion because there was a 1940s movie showing couturier and I said I want to do that profession. He has a muse, I wanted to have a muse and do a fashion show. 

Other celebrity guests included Janet Street Porter (left) and hat designer Stephen Jones (right)

Guests were served champagne by waiters who wore the designer's signature nautical stripe and sailor hats

'I never expected to be famous.'

'Before I started to work I was lying a lot, inventing things that were not real to make me interesting. But after I tried not to lie. And it led me to incredible things.

'I got to collaborate with ballet shows, Madonna, Kylie Minogue, directors. They were asking me to work with them. It was an honour and an adventure. I even did perfume. I still love making collections.

'I definitely want to make another show, and I do need to leave something for the next young designers.'

The Fashion World of Jean Paul Gaultier From the Sidewalk to the Catwalk is open to the public from tomorrow until 25 August 2014, at London's Barbican.
