Bill O'Reilly says God told him to write his new book, Killing Jesus: A History.

The 64-year-old Fox News anchor explains in an interview on CBS' 60 Minutes that one night he awoke with the title of the book in his head.

He says he believes he got that message from the Holy Spirit.

O'Reilly says the book is a researched, historic account. Despite its de-emphasis of religion, he is using his special gifts from God in a positive way.

The anchor, who is Catholic, says it's all part of God's plan for him.

O'Reilly's interview with Norah O'Donnell will air on the 46th-season premiere of 60 Minutes on Sunday evening.

Published by Henry Holt and Co., Killing Jesus follows O'Reilly's two best sellers, Killing Lincoln and Killing Kennedy.

O'Reilly's book about Abraham Lincoln was panned by critics in 2011 for spinning a web of mistakes about the former president.

He was criticized for the book's lack of references and footnotes to back up its claims.

The book was subsequently banned from Ford Theatre bookstores despite riding high on the New York Times best-seller list for two months.

O'Reilly has also made headlines in the past over his highly publicized divorce from Maureen McPhilmy.

The former couple, who have two children together, divorced in 2011 and became entwined in a bitter custody battle.

O'Reilly was accused in March this year of running a smear campaign against his wife of 15 years and even trying to ban her from the Catholic Church, according to Gawker blogger John Cook.

The news anchor allegedly told the church that his ex wife was receiving communion even though she'd been divorced and remarried and that she'd been telling their children that her second marriage was valid in the eyes of God.

For this, McPhilmy was allegedly reprimanded by her Long Island parish in writing.

McPhilmy remarried a Nassau County detective - whose career was also allegedly in jeopardy from O'Reilly's reported smear campaign.
