Identical twins have appeared in court charged with the rape of the same woman.

Mohammed and Aftab Asghar were arrested after DNA evidence allegedly linked one – or both – of them to the crime.

Prosecutors will almost certainly need to use other evidence to build their case.

Accused: The pair of identical twins, aged 22, have appeared in court charged with rape

Identical twins have matching DNA, 
according to the Forensic Science Service, so a case based solely on 
such evidence may well fail because prosecutors would be unable to 
isolate who was responsible for the alleged rape.

Police
 and the Crown Prosecution Service are still trying to determine whether
 they should continue to pursue the case against both men.

The twins, 
22, appeared at a preliminary hearing at Reading Crown Court on Tuesday 
when prosecutor Sandra Beck requested more time for the Crown to pursue 
lines of inquiry.

She said: 
‘It is an unusual case. They are identical twins.

Identical (monozygotic) twins happen when a single egg (zygote) is fertilised.  

The egg then divides into two embryos, creating identical twins who share the same genes as one another.

Since monozygotic twins come from the same fertilized egg, they have the exact same DNA.

Identical twins are always the same sex and blood type.

Identical twins do not run in families, contrary to popular myth.

'There is further work 
due and there is an indication which would tend to support that one was 
not at the location.

‘It may mean that only one of the defendants faces trial.’

No
 details were divulged about the circumstances of the alleged offence of
 November 5, 2011.

Neither defendant entered a plea and both were 
granted bail. The brothers, from Reading, are expected to face a trial 
on December 2.

Identical 
twins have the same DNA because they originate from the same egg, which 
divides into two embryos after it is fertilised.

They
 are always the same sex and have the same blood type – though their 
fingerprints will differ.

Twins who are not identical do not carry the 
same DNA.
