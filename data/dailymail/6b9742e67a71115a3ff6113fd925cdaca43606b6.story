Eating out when you're an A-lister can be fraught with risk. A chance meeting with a paparazzo lurking in a doorway can mean a snap of your unkempt hair or a make-up free face splashed across the papers the next day.

So it's no wonder celebrities are flocking to try out a new service that means they can have a restaurant experience in the comfort of their own  home.

Lily Allen and Stephen Fry are just two of a number of famous names who swear by housebites.com, a recently opened gourmet-to-go delivery and takeaway service that means customers - A-list or otherwise - can order restaurant quality food cooked by a top chef and have it delivered direct to their door.

The company, so far only available in London, has a list of chefs who work out of specific postcodes of London.

When a customer enters their postcode and the day and time they would like to order food, the chefs available to deliver or cook for collection appear, with their full menus detailed.

Customers can choose from a full three-course menu, which could be from any international cuisine, from French to Indian, Chinese or Moroccan.

The chefs will then conjure up the feast, package it in takeaway containers and whizz it straight to the buyer's door, or have it ready to be collected if they are out of the catchment area.

The kind of dishes on offer range from hearty homecooked Italian meatballs and lasagne to tasty Provencal fish dishes or traditional Indian cooking.

The firm has cheekily released a top five list of dishes most ordered by A-listers - and the diversity of the list illustrates the variety of food the service offers.

At the top is sea bass with new potatoes and courgettes, followed by chicken tikka masala (these A-listers are terribly traditional!), boeuf Provencal, tuna steak with vegetables, and Asian pork belly with sticky rice. 

We ordered to Kensington, and at the time we wanted to eat, French Provencal chef Laurent Rossi was available and he was close enough to deliver.

There were a further two chefs on duty, one who specialised in Indian food, one who specialised in Moroccan. Both of these could cook for us, but as they were around two miles away, our food would have to be collected. 

Chef Laurent Rossi is an award-winning French chef with 20 years experience who has worked across the Caribbean, the U.S. and the UK, and at some of the city's top restaurants including No 1 Lombard St, L'Oranger in Mayfair, and L'Aventure in St John's Wood.

He is based in the West London area, and can also offer a private dining service for dinner parties as well as running his own successful chocolatier (www.chocololo.com).

Today though, we chose from his menu on housebites.com.

We started with beetroot carpaccio, which was served with a well-dressed rocket salad, nuggets of tangy onion and cucumber caviar - tiny little palate-baffling balls of cucumber that chef Rossi had carved out. A fresh viola flower added a pretty flourish.

A warm goat's cheese salad with roasted vegetables was the perfect balance of sharp, crumbly-soft cheese and sweet red and yellow peppers, with roasted carrot and courgette adding substance.

As our main course, we had seabass fillet, pan fried to perfection, with fennel and potatoes. A chicken and tarragon fricasee, its creamy sauce, dotted with green grapes incredibly moreish, was accompanied by delicate towers of creamy dauphinoise potatoes.

Pudding was French toast with toffee apple sauce, a generous portion that we initially crowed in disbelief would feed six - then promptly ate between two.

The caramel sauce was fragrant with rosemary and orange blossom, and rich with cider. Sinfully good.

The food, which came packaged in plastic containers encased in neat cardboard sleeves, travelled well.

Our delivery slot was just half an hour long, the wait from ordering to arrival 45 minutes.

And as for the make or break question of price - well, this was no more expensive than our local Chinese takeaway - but we felt a lot better about eating it.

The seabass was £12, the chicken £10.95. Pudding was £5.95, the starters were £4.50 for the beetroot and £5.50 for the goat's cheese salad.We certainly felt the prices were more than fair, given the quality of the food and service.

There are no preservatives, no short-cuts. The menus change frequently, the ingredients are fresh. You can order fresh grilled fish; a salad. Proper vegetables that were in the ground a few days ago, not in a packet. In fact, you can put in a request for your favourite Provencal dish to Laurent and he may well just cook it for you. On his Twitter feed (@rossi_laurent) you can find out what he is cooking today.

Beautiful flavours, restaurant quality - but eaten in the comfort of your own home.

We are sold.
