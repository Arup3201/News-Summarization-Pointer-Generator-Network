Britain awoke to frosty and clear conditions this morning after a downpour which saw a week's worth of rain fall in the South.

But the country has been warned of further floods and travel disruption as a 'conveyor belt' of Atlantic storm fronts soak the country for the next week. 

The Met Office has forecast a 'succession' of fronts  with heavy rain sweeping across the country from Monday up until the weekend.

Strong winds and  60mph gales are expected to hit the West and accompany the heavy rain.

Met Office forecaster Calum MacColl said: 'A succession of fronts will come in due to an Atlantic-dominated westerly flow.

'Conditions can be bad with these heavy rain events and there may well be local impacts to travel.

'There could be localised flooding and high rivers in areas with ground saturated from heavy rain, such as south Wales and south-west Scotland.

'We're keeping an eye on rain and wind and reviewing the situation based on our warning thresholds.

'Rain with heavy bursts will push north-east through Monday, slow to clear the east on Tuesday with 40-50mph winds in the West, with 60mph possible on Scotland's Western Isles, and strong winds in the East.

Thunder is also predicted to hit on several days next week and longer spells of rain will continue into the weekend.

The Environment Agency, which raised the flood risk for the South-East today after Saturday's downpours, said it would monitor forecasts and issue alerts as appropriate.

On Monday fog patches will start slowly clearing and a band of rain and stronger winds will start moving into Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.

Forecaster Brian Gaze of The Weather Outlook said: 'A conveyor belt of Atlantic fronts will sweep east across the UK through the week, with flood-prone areas at risk.'

Unsettled and often windy weather with showers or longer spells of rain are expected for Tuesday and Wednesday.
