Bungling thief Jason Farmer was jailed for three-and-a-half years after his electronic tag placed him at the scene of a burglary

A dopey burglar who raided a house while wearing an electronic tag that tracked his every move is back behind bars. 

Bungling Jason Farmer was arrested within four hours of the break-in after police were able to place him at the scene of the crime by the gadgets satellite signal.

When officers  arrested the 23-year-old serial burglar they found his haul, including two stolen laptops and a mobile phone.

Farmer was fitted with the 'Buddy Tag' after being released on licence from a previous prison sentence in August last year.

He was jailed for three-and-a-half years at Maidstone Crown Court after he admitted carrying out the early morning burglary.

The judge was told how Farmer broke into the property in Maidstone, Kent, while the owners were sleeping on December 23, and stole two laptops worth £1,000. 

They awoke to find a candle had been lit by an intruder who got into their home through a fanlight in the conservatory.

Prosecutor Bridget Todd told the court that Farmer's tag showed he had left his home at 2.38am and was in the garden of the raided property at 3.09am.

When he was arrested police found the two stolen laptops, one of which contained a 'lifetime' collection of photos, and a mobile phone taken in another burglary six days earlier.

The prosecutor said Farmer, of no fixed abode, had a number of previous convictions, including eight for house burglaries and seven taken into consideration.

The court was told he was a 'three strikes' burglar which qualified him for a three-year minimum prison sentence.

Philip Sinclair, defending, said Farmer's first conviction was at the age of 13.

 'He has no explanation as to why he keeps re-offending,' he said.

Maidstone Crown Court, pictured, was told that Farmer was arrested within four hours of the break-in after police were able to pin-point him to the scene of the crime

 'He had been on licence for several months and was apparently doing well.

'He made himself available for satellite tracking with a Buddy Tag.

'He knew if he re-offended he would be caught. He went out in the middle of the night and committed the offence.

'He has committed a burglary knowing he would be caught. He is not giving me any clue as to why he keeps re-offending. It may be he is hiding a drug habit but he is not admitting it.

'He said he wanted to buy his mother a Christmas present. There is clearly something going on. He is not doing it because he is wicked.'

Recorder Deborah Charles told Farmer his victims were forced to spend Christmas making police statements, rather than enjoying themselves.
