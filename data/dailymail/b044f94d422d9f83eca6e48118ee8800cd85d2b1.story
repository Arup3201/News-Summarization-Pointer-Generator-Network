Comfortable? Myrtle Beach Pelicans' general manager Andy Milovich received a prostate exam during a Thursday night game that was broadcast to the stadium

Milovich earlier agreed to the public exam if the 'Fierce Fallon' Facebook page, dedicated to a young girl named Fallon with brain cancer, received 10,000 likes by noon Thursday, the team's website said.

The minor league baseball team earlier released a video with messages of support from its players for Fallon.

'It’s one of the oddest nights in probably minor league baseball, but truthfully probably one of the most important,' Milovich told The Sun.

'The attention it garnered for the franchise is fantastic, but the attention it garnered for Fierce Fallon, what we want to do for her, and for prostate cancer awareness is obviously the point, and I couldn’t be more excited to have been a part of it.'

The newspaper reported that 6,599 people were in the audience.

Meanwhile, Dr. Glen Dangi told ESPN, 'I did [prostate] exams for three years and New York City for 17 years, and this was a first.'

The exam was filmed in a radio booth, ESPN said.

Lake Elsinore Storm general manager Dave Oster promised a prostate exam 'if Fallon's page reached 12,000 likes,' the Pelican Bays' website said - and she already has 11,602.

The Myrtle Beach Pelicans beat the Frederick Keys Thursday, 5-4.
