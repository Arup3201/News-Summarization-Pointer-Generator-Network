London Welsh remain convinced that they can put up a fight for Aviva Premiership survival but the omens are not good after they were beaten 23-3 at home by relegation rivals Newcastle.

The Exiles lost their sixth successive match since gaining promotion, but head coach Justin Burnell said: ‘I don’t think the league was decided today.

‘There are still 16 games to go and we’ve got spirit. Every loss is disappointing, but this was a vast improvement after last week’s display at Harlequins.’

Welsh are bottom, eight points adrift of the Falcons, having conceded an average of 45 points per game. Burnell’s defiance is admirable but his side face a struggle to stay up.
