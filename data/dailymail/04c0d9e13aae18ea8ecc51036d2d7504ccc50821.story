Jack the Labrador refused to leave the front door of his home in Melton Mowbray with owner Judy Huddleston because he was afraid of open spaces

A dog with an irrational fear of the outside which was so bad he didn’t leave his home for a year has finally been on his first walk.

Eighteen-month-old chocolate Labrador Jack was terrified of going outside and was so scared he would physically shake, cry and even play dead to avoid leaving his house.

But thanks to a dog psychologist, Jack has managed to overcome his fear and has finally been able to go on his first walk.

Jack had stayed indoors ever since he
 was puppy and had neven been for a walk, despite how much his worried 
owner, Judy Huddleston, 42, tried to coax him outside.

The
 only fresh air Jack would get is when he went to relieve himself in a 
small patch of his back garden. Aside from that he stayed indoors.

Eventually
 after consultation with a dog-whisperer, the family deployed some 
smelly cheese to coax the dog through the front door.

Mrs
 Huddleston, from Melton Mowbray, Leics, said: 'We don’t know what 
caused Jack’s phobia, but we think he was spooked by something when he 
was a young puppy.

'When
 we would try and take Jack outside he would be visibly distressed. He 
would cling to the wall and refuse to move, while howling and crying.

'The family and I were beside ourselves as we wanted to help Jack get outside but nothing we tried worked.'

At first the mother-of-two hoped it was just a phase Jack would grow out of but after a year of Jack staying indoors, she realised his agoraphobia was a serious concern.

Eventually, Judy Huddleston sought help from dog-whisperer Lynne Marshall, right, who managed to coax Jack, centre, out of the house with the promise of cheese

She said: 'I tried a puppy trainer and all different family members had a go at helping but nothing would make Jack budge.

'It got to the stage where Jack was petrified of going near the front door. He was growing into a healthy dog and he needed to experience going outside.

'It would break my heart that I couldn’t even take him for a walk.

'He was physically unable to step outside the front door.'

Eventually Ms Huddleston So distressed owner Judy decided to call in a 'dog whisperer' - behavioural psychologist Lynne Marshall, 54, from Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire.

Judy Huddleston thought she would never be able to take her dog for a walk until she met Lynne Marshall, who cured Jack in just one hour

Through a combination of dog psychology and careful coaxing, Lynne managed to help Jack break through his phobia, and after just an hour he was bounding around outside for the first time in his life.

Mrs Huddleston revealed: 'I was just overjoyed and amazed. Poor Jack was terrified of the outdoor and didn’t dare set foot outside but within just an hour of Lynne working with him he was bounding around outside, acting like a dog.

'It was something I never thought I would see. I was just so proud of Jack.'Ms Marshall, who has worked with dogs her whole life, has been helping dogs to overcome their phobias and anxieties for the past decade with her Love Your Dog Training.

She uses her knowledge of animal and human psychology to get into the mindset of both the dog- and the owner.

After just one hour's treatment, Jack the Lab, left, was able to go to the park with owner Judy Huddleston, right, for the first time in his 18-month life

Since the treatment, Judy Huddleston said she cannot believe the change this has made to Jack's life

According to Ms Marshall: 'Jack was one of the most extreme cases I have dealt with in terms of anxiety.

'His story really touched my heart and I just thought it was so sad to have a dog that as unable to go outside.

'He was totally restricted to being in the house and had never experienced the sights and smells of going for a walk.

Ms Marshall first explained to Ms Huddleston about how her anxiety over Jack being indoors could be picked up by Jack.

'It is as much about training the owner as it is the dog. Dogs are able to pick up human body language and emotions and usually if the owner is stressed out, the dog will be as well.'

Judy Huddleston said she 'tried every trick in the book' to get Jack outside, but nothing would work

Ms Marshall had to work to build trust between her and Jack and after a few minutes of petting and playing, she tried to lead him towards the front gate, from the back garden.

She said: 'He physically stuck himself to the wall and would not budge, so I knew it was a deep rooted fear that Jack had.'

Ms Marshall used her knowledge of the dog's physiology to tempt him outside the front gate with a serving of cheese.'

She said: 'Labradors have an incredible sense of smell and I used tiny bits of smelly cheese to interest Jack.

'He was very scent orientated and managed to overcome his fear.'

After picking up the scent, the puppy stepped slowly through the front door and along the path to the gate. 

According to Ms Huddleston: 'I couldn’t believe my eyes. I had tried every trick in the book the get Jack outside, including tempting him with treats but Lynne had a hypnotic way of talking to Jack and using the cheese to encourage him.

'It was fantastic to see Jack suddenly sniffing around outside the way a dog should.

'Jack now has a whole new lease of life and we couldn’t be happier.'
