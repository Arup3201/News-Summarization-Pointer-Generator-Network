The convicted killer of three Ohio students at a high school cafeteria who escaped from a Lima prison Thursday has been taken back into custody.

Nineteen-year-old T.J. Lane escaped along with two other inmates and one of the inmates was immediately captured, Lima police Sgt. Andy Green said. 

A search was then underway in woods and a residential area near the prison, he said. Lane was discovered after 1am with the help of police aircraft hiding out in or near an area farm building.

Lane's accomplice remained at large.

Caught: T.J. Lane smirks as he listens to the judge during his sentencing in Chardon, Ohio. Ohio police said Thursday, Sept. 11, 2014,  that Lane, 19, the convicted killer of three students at a high school cafeteria, escaped from prisonand was caught hours later near a farm building

Still on the run: Authorities identified the other inmate as Clifford E. Opperud, 45, and said he was serving a sentence for aggravated robbery, burglary, and kidnapping

Authorities did not believe the two men are armed, however. They had no further information on how the inmates escaped from prison. Green said the police were notified about 8 p.m. Thursday evening. 

Lane pleaded guilty last year to shooting three students in February 2012 at Chardon High School, east of Cleveland. He said he didn't know why he did. He was given three life sentences.

Authorities identified the other inmate as Clifford E. Opperud, 45, and said he was serving a sentence for aggravated robbery, burglary, and kidnapping.  

Before Lane's case went to adult court in 2012, a juvenile court judge ruled that Lane was mentally competent to stand trial despite evidence he suffers from hallucinations, psychosis and fantasies. At his sentencing, Lane was defiant, smiling and smirking throughout, including while four relatives of the victims spoke.

Daniel Parmertor and Demetrius Hewlin, both 16, and Russell King Jr., 17, who were killed in the Feb. 27, 2012, rampage. Three others were injured. 

Reached Thursday at her home in Chardon, Dina Parmertor, mother of Daniel Parmertor, said of Lane's escape: 'I'm disgusted that it happened. I'm extremely scared and panic stricken. I can't believe it.'  

Chardon Police told CNN they offered to provide extra patrols to the families of Lane's victims and to people in the area who opt for it.

Chardon community of about 5,000 which is 190 miles away from Lima, Lane's known whereabouts before his early morning capture. 

Ohio public safety and correction officials said they began an 'extensive search,' along with the local authorities and the Ohio State Highway Patrol after the inmates escaped at 7:40 p.m. Thursday from the Allen Oakwood Correctional Institution.

Escaped: TJ Lane was serving his life sentence here at the Allen County Correctional Institution mixed security prison in Lima, Ohio. Details on how he and his fellow inmates escaped Thursday were not immediately available

Dangerous: The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation immediately released a flyer to aid in the search for Lane, who was captured hours later

In addition to at least three other offenses for which Lane has been punished in past months, the cold-blooded teen killer has been found guilty of the following disorderliness:

August 2014: Lane was cited for urinating on an Allen Correctional Institution prison wall

October 2013: Lane disobeyed a prison work order and lost 10 days recreation time

August 2013: Lane refused to follow through with a work assignment and was verbally reprimanded

July 2013: Lane was separated from the general population for 10 days as punishment for giving himself a tattoo

They did not immediately reveal how the inmates escaped.

However, recent state report on the prison revealed it's over capacity and has recently suffered from increased violence.

An April visit from a state committee found that the Allen Oakwood Correctional Institution housed 1,635 prisoners--217 over its capacity, reports the Plains Dealer. That's about 15 percent over capacity.

The recent report's concern over the 20-year-old facility appeared to focus on the higher security areas, where Lane was housed.

'Security management remains a concern, both in terms of how the higher security inmates are handled, as well as discipline for misconduct,' reads the report.

According to the report, there was a 60 percent increase in inmate assaults on staff between 2012 and 2013. 

'All available troopers from the Ohio State Highway Patrol have been joined by Allen County Sheriff's deputies and local area law enforcement in establishing a perimeter and searching the area,' Ohio Department of Public Safety Director John Born said. 'A Patrol helicopter with advanced infrared detection equipment has been deployed and is engaged in the search as well.

Born encouraged the public to call 911 of any suspicious persons or possible sightings.

APB: Police in northwest Ohio went quickly to  work searching for the escaped inmates after catching a third. The group escaped via unnamed means just after 7:30pm Thursday. After Lane's capture, Opperud remained at large

Lane fired 10 shots at students in a cafeteria at Chardon High School, east of Cleveland. He was there waiting for a bus to another school.

Prosecutors say Lane took a .22-caliber pistol and a knife to the school and fired 10 shots at a group of students in the cafeteria. Daniel Parmertor and Demetrius Hewlin, both 16, and Russell King Jr., 17, were killed.

Lane, who was 17 at the time of the shooting, was prosecuted as an adult. Minutes before his guilty plea, the judge accepted a report finding Lane mentally competent to stand trial.

Investigators say he admitted shooting at students but said he didn't know why he did it. Prosecutors say Lane took a .22-caliber pistol and a knife to the school on Feb. 27, 2012, and fired 10 shots at a group of students in the cafeteria.

Lane attended an alternative school for students who haven't done well in traditional schools. He was at Chardon waiting for a bus.

Attorney Ian Friedman, who defended Lane in the Chardon High case expressed shock when the Cleveland Plain Dealer informed him of his former client's escape.

'It's wild,' Friedman said. 'I'm sure there will be a lot of questions asked about how the correctional facility could allow this to happen.'

Friedman also warned that while dangerous in many ways, Lane also wields the weapon of intellect.

'I can't speak to what his mindset is,' Friedman said. 'But I don't think anyone would dispute the fact that he's a very smart young man.'

The frightening words of TJ Lane's attorney: Ian Friedman tweeted his take on his old client's escape Thursday night and it left many with a sense of unease

Wearing a T-shirt with 'killer' scrawled across it, a teenager cursed and gestured obscenely as he was given three life sentences Tuesday for shooting to death three students in an Ohio high school cafeteria.

T.J. Lane, 18, had pleaded guilty  to shooting at students in February 2012 at Chardon High School, east of Cleveland. Investigators have said he admitted to the shooting but said he didn't know why he did it.

Before the case went to adult court, a juvenile court judge ruled that Lane was mentally competent to stand trial despite evidence he suffers from hallucinations, psychosis and fantasies.

Lane was defiant during the sentencing, smiling and smirking throughout, including while four relatives of victims spoke.

After he came in, he calmly unbuttoned his blue dress shirt to reveal the T-shirt reading 'killer,' which the prosecutor noted was similar to one he wore during the shooting.

At one point, he swiveled around in his chair toward the gallery where his own family members and those of the slain teenagers were sitting and spoke suddenly, surprising even his lawyer.

'The hand that pulls the trigger that killed your sons now masturbates to the memory,' he said, then cursed at and raised his middle finger toward the victims' relatives.

A student who was wounded in the rampage dismissed the outburst.

'He said it like a scared little boy and couldn't talk slow enough that anyone could understand him,' said Nate Mueller, who was nicked in the ear in the shooting.

The forgotten school shooting: An Ohio State highway patrol helicopter prepares to leave the grounds of Chardon High School in February 2012 after Lane opened fire with a handgun in the cafeteria of an Ohio high school east of Cleveland on Monday, fatally wounding three students

Dina Parmertor, mother of victim Daniel, called Lane 'a pathetic excuse for a human being' and wished upon him 'an extremely, slow torturous death.' She said she has nightmares and her family has been physically sick over the crimes.

'From now on, he will only be a killer,' she said, as Lane's smile widened. 'I want him to feel my anger toward him.'

Prosecutors say Lane took a .22-caliber pistol and a knife to the school and fired 10 shots at a group of students in the cafeteria. Daniel Parmertor and Demetrius Hewlin, both 16, and Russell King Jr., 17, were killed.

Lane was at Chardon waiting for a bus to the alternative school he attended, for students who haven't done well in traditional settings.

Lane had pleaded guilty last month to three counts of aggravated murder, two counts of attempted aggravated murder and one count of felonious assault.

Life imprisonment without parole was the maximum sentence Lane faced. He wasn't eligible for the death penalty because he was 17 at the time of the shootings. Relatives of the slain students indicated earlier they wanted Lane to get the maximum sentence.
