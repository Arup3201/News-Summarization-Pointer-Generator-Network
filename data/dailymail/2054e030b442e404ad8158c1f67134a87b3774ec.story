Are you ready to experience the worst flight of your life? Virgin America will show it to you.

In an attempt to bore viewers as much as possible they've  released a six hour promotion video that's less enjoyable - and longer - to watch than paint drying.

The campaign aims to show travellers just how mind bendingly monotonous it can be to fly with one of those other 'blah' airlines.

Blah Airlines has a mock website at www.blahairlines.com where their tagline is 'You will get there'

Seen through the eyes of a passenger (stuck in an middle seat, of course) you're able to experience Flight 101 on 'Blah Airlines' in real time as it takes off from Newark Liberty International Airport and flies to San Francisco.

The journey time is five hours and 45 minutes and every excruciating second is  played out by mannequins.

Listen to mundane conversations  about a fellow passenger's love of cheese and screeching air hostesses; experience the eternal hell of a child in front incessantly bashing their chair; watch a terrible film; fall asleep and get woken up by someone listening to  rock music and inhale a cloud of hairspray from the woman next to you - the list on annoyances is endless.

Real time: the flight's journey time is 5 hr 45 mins and every  second is excruciatingly boring

Like watching paint dry: Listen to mundane conversations and chippy air hostesses from middle seat

The film is available to watch online (already more than 150,000 people have) and on Virgin America's own in-flight entertainment system. 

The unusual ad was  created by advertising company Eleven San Francisco and Blah Airlines even has its own fictitious website at www.blahairlines.com where  list three types of seat are listed, 'Aisle, Middle and Window' and the tagline is 'You will get there'.

Fake testimonials include 'I have flown BLAH airlines.' by Terry B from Nebraska and 'They got me to Seattle. I'll give them that' from Megan P in Florida. 

Virgin America and advertising company Eleven San Francisco are behind the unusual ad campaign

An integrated approach: There's even a social media channel for the airline called @BLAHAirlines

There's also a social media channel for the airline called @BLAHAirlines which is tweeting  gems such as 'We are passionate about clear aisles' and 'The best in-flight entertainment is a conversation with a fellow passenger'.

They will reply, like a real airline, to your tweets. 

Virgin told Adweek, 'The passengers have no choice but to be on 'autopilot' to get through the tedious journey. 

'Just trying to watch the video is downright painful—and that's the point. If you wouldn't sit through the entire film, why would you pay money to experience it in real life?'
