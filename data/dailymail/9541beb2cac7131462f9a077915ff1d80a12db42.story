The widow of the Oxford professor who died at a colleague’s home has told him she does not blame him for the tragedy.

Police arrested mathematician Dr Devinder Sivia after his friend, world-renowned astrophysicist Professor Steven Rawlings, was found dead following a scuffle at his bungalow.

Dr Sivia’s family say the professor’s wife Linda had called him on the night of the death because she was worried about her husband’s ‘emotional state’.

The Sikh academic then had dinner with Professor Rawlings at a pub before taking his friend of more than 30 years back to his home.

He told his family that Professor Rawlings, 50, was ‘very emotional’, attacked him and collapsed with a suspected heart attack while he was restraining him.

Dr Sivia, 49, was arrested on suspicion of murder, but later released on police bail.

Detectives believe no criminal offence was committed.

Mrs Rawlings has called both Dr Sivia 
and his family to say that she does not blame him for her husband’s 
death last Wednesday night.

Dr
Sivia’s brother, Gurdip, 59, a warehouse worker from Birmingham, said: 
‘I have spoken to my brother and he is very upset about this tragedy as 
Steven was a close friend.

Speaking out: Professor Rawlings' widow Linda (left) yesterday said she believes the death of her husband (right) was a 'tragic accident'

‘It was an accident, it was a tragic accident. Steven was out of control and in his mental state attacked my brother.

'My brother defended himself and it looks like while restraining him he had a heart attack.

‘Linda has called my brother and says 
she doesn’t blame him as she was the one who asked him to go to the pub 
and talk to Steven. She gave him instructions to talk to Steven at the 
pub because he was in an emotional state.’

During
dinner at the Bear Hotel in Wantage, Dr Sivia became increasingly 
concerned about his friend’s behaviour. Staff at the inn said the 
professor, a regular visitor, was unusually subdued.

Dr Sivia invited him to stay at his bungalow in Southmoor, near Abingdon, but when they got to his home his friend apparently became increasingly agitated and attacked him.

Dr Sivia dialled 999 and alerted 
neighbours when he collapsed, but despite their efforts to resuscitate 
him he died at the scene.

It
has also emerged that Professor Rawlings had to step down from the team
building the world’s largest radio telescope after struggling with 
mental health problems since summer last year. He had played a huge part
in developing the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), a telescope which will 
be able to look 13billion years back in time to the beginnings of the 
universe.

But he was unable to complete his project
and also dropped out of his academic work at Oxford University’s St 
Peter’s College last summer.

Lecturer: Dr Sivia worked in the maths department at St John's college in Oxford

Professor Phil Diamond, who had worked with Professor Rawlings on the SKA scheme, said: ‘He became withdrawn and dropped out of both his academic work and the SKA.

‘I was told he suffered some mental problems but I don’t know what caused them.’  

Detective Superintendent Rob Mason, from Thames Valley Police’s major crime unit, said: ‘We are mindful that ultimately the death may be a matter for a coroner’s inquest rather than a criminal court and I would ask for patience from both the media and the public while we continue our investigation.’
