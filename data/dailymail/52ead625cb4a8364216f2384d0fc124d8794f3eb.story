It should be bustling with wealthy holiday makers and business executives but instead this crumbling five star hotel lies empty after the stunning project was mothballed nearly two decades ago.

The 247 rooms of the Northern Crown Hotel have never been slept in, and the corridors of what should have been a grand lobby are filled with an eerie silence.

The luxury hotel was set to be a premier St. Petersburg destination when construction began in the Russian city in 1988.

Empty: It should be filled with hotel guests but instead this grand lobby of the Northern Crown Hotel lies empty after construction was never completed

Unused: The crumbling corridors at the five star hotel lay empty, and the 247 rooms have never been slept in

Lying dormant: The hotel was to be a St. Petersburg luxury destination when work began on the 50,000 square metre site

Mothballed: Work on the hotel began in 1988 but the project stalled after a bank helping to fund the project ran into financial difficulties

No light at the end of the tunnel: Although sunshine streams through the large windows, the finished hotel has never seen the light of day

However, workers downed tools at the hotel in 1995, with the buildingÂ  90 per cent complete after a bank which had been helping to finance the construction ran into financial troubles.

Although several attempts have been made to recommence building work have been made, the unfinished hotel was instead left dormant and is now due to be demolished.

Work had begun on the hotel in the late 80s by the firm Monteksgroeksport, based in what was then Yugoslavia, after the project was commissioned by the Soviet government.

Luxury destination: The five star hotel would have boasted five restaurants, six bars, a conference hall, sports complex, swimming pool and underground parking

Under construction: It was to have been a high-end hotel, and the first of its class in the city to be purpose built, instead of a renovation of an existing building

Left to rot: What should have been grand function rooms at the hotel have instead been left to decay

Downward spiral: Lift shafts at the hotel have been left unfinished after the project was abandoned in 1995

Regime change: Work had begun on the hotel by the firm Monteksgroeksport, based in what was then Yugoslavia, after the project was commissioned by the Soviet government

The five star destination, on the banks of the River Karpovki, was to cover around 50,000 square metres and would have boasted five restaurants, six bars, a conference hall, sports complex, swimming pool and underground parking.

In 1992 the project was privatised, with St. Petersburg Bank owning 92 per cent of the newly-created company Inter-Hotel Petrograd.

Grand designs: The hotel featured stunning archways allowing guests to see into the grand lobby

Construction came to a halt in late 1995, the date of the initial proposed opening, with the facility 90 per cent complete after the bank ran into financial difficulties and the project was frozen.

It is now waiting to be demolished, with a large residential complex due to be built on the site.

The images of the empty building were captured by Russian photographer Lana Sator, and were featured on her blog lana-sator.livejournal.com.

No grand opening: The project was halted in 1995, when the hotel had originally been due to open to the public

Room with a view: The hotel complex was built on the banks of the River Karpovki

Setting sun: The unfinished hotel has lain empty for nearly two decades

Long wait to check in: Instead of being filled with holidaymakers and business executives the hotel is now falling into ruin

Lying empty: What was supposed to have been a bustling hotel is instead eerily silent

Left to ruin: Many parts of the hotel are now overgrown with weeds

Work in progress: This grand mosaic flooring was left unfinished
