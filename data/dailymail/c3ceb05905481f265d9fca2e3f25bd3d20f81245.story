A military policeman has been praised by the legendary Scottish author Irvine Welsh after tattooing his quotes and characters onto his legs.

Joe Stanton, 21, had lines from the novels Trainspotting and Filth inked on his skin, along with a depiction of Ewan McGregor’s character Renton in the 1996 film version of Trainspotting.

He said he fell in love with the author's work after seeing the hit film, which exposes the brutality and humanity of a group of heroin addicts in Edinburgh.

The soldier, who is from Nottingham and based in Aldershot, said: 'I first saw Trainspotting a few years ago and I absolutely loved it, how it was shot, the story and just how different it was alongside other films, including the story.

'Then more recently I read the book and really enjoyed it.

'As soon as I saw Filth was being released and it was written by Irvine Welsh I wanted to see it.

'I went on to read that book, then Porno and now I’m starting his other book called Skagboys.

'I’m a massive fan due to the style of how he writes his books and the darkness of some of the stories is brilliant.

'Filth was amazing as it appealed to me due to the fact that I do military police work, albeit that shows slightly different methods of policing.'

Made into a film last year starring James McAvoy and Jamie Bell, Filth tells the story of a corrupt, sexist, homophobic, cocaine-snorting policeman who struggles to balance his drug habit with tackling Edinburgh's violent gangs.

Mr Stanton's quotes tattoo begins with a line from Filth: 'You can only live in the world you ken [know], the rest is just wishful thinking or paranoia.'

It ends with a line from Trainspotting: 'Better to live life as enjoyable and complete an experience as possible, in case death is s***e, which I suspect it will be.'

The soldier paid £100 for the quotes tattoo, which he then photographed and tweeted to the legendary author.

Mr Welsh retweeted the photo to his 114,000 followers, saying: 'Pretty amazing work there mate!'

Mr Stanton said: 'I am absolutely buzzing that he replied.'

He added: 'My girlfriend loves all my tattoos but my parents not so much.

'They didn’t really mind when it was all the family related stuff but when I started getting different ones done then that changed.

'However, my mum has admitted she loves these quotes and has said that she thought they were quite funny.

'I’ll definitely be getting more done.'

The Red Cap, who has been in the Army since he was 19, had his first tattoo a month before joining up in memory of his late grandfather.

He added: 'It started with the David Beckham angel one and I also got some quotes from the band Green Day on my back.'

Born and raised in Edinburgh, Irvine Welsh is now recognised as one of Britain's most successful authors.

When Trainspotting was published in 1993, it allegedly failed to make the Booker Prize shortlist because its unflinching depictions of drugs and sex offended the sensibilities of two female judges.
