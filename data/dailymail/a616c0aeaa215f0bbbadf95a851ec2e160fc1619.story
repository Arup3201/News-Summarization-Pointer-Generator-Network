Everyone has experienced the frustrated feeling of jabbing at an orange trying to get the peel off, only to be left with a sticky mess.

Now a new method has revealed the quickest and easiest way to to do it - and it only involves three slices of a knife.

Thanks to a new 'life hack' video from YouTube user Rumble Viral, an orange is opened up in a matter of seconds, and with minimal juice-loss and squashed segments. 

Method: Cut two opposite ends off the orange (left) and make an incision on one side (right)

Easy peasy: Then cut into one side until reaching the centre (left) and pull the entire thing apart (right)

The 39-second video shows exactly the best way to best open up the citrus fruit in simple steps.

Firstly, you cut off the top and the bottom of the orange.

Next,  you make a cut into the one side of the orange, until the knife reaches the fruit's centre.

Then, it's just a case of spreading the skin open to reveal all the intact and neat segments. Peel and enjoy! 

The viral video has already racked up 420,000 views in a short time, and many commentators are raving about the simple yet innovative method. 

'This is definitely gong to save me some time. It normally take me forever just to peel one,' says one commentator of the video.

Another has commented: 'Good tip. Next time I don't have excuses to juice the oranges instead of eating them whole.' 

Oranges are a versatile fruit and can be eaten fresh, processed in a juice, or the fragrant peel can be added to dishes for flavouring.  

The citrus fruit is great as a quick snack, an excellent source of vitamin C and also has high antioxidant properties, so it's no wonder that quicker methods of access are being attempted.

The only argument that people have against the three-slice method is that while it works swiftly in a kitchen environment, you're at a loss if you're lacking a knife and chopping board.

One commentator questioned: 'What if you don't always carry a knife on you?'  

The method only takes 30 seconds and ensure minimal juice-loss or segment bruising
