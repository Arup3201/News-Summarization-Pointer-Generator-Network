A Louisiana teenager was killed while playing a game with friends on train tracks this weekend when some equipment threw him under one of the cars.

Brandt Torres, 17, and three friends had been placing coins on train tracks to watch them be crushed early Sunday, law enforcement officials told The Advocate.

His death comes just two years after Torres almost died in a hunting accident.

Torres lay on the ground inches from the passing cars as a ladder hanging off one of the cars caught him, tossing him under the train. 

He was just south of a Union Pacific rail yard in Livonia, and he died about 1:30 a.m.

Authorities say Torres nearly died two years earlier in a hunting accident when he stood up in the path of a fellow duck hunter. 

A sheriff's spokesman, Steve Juge, called his recovery 'close to a miracle.' 

'He was critically injured to the point that they didn't know if he would make it', Juge said.

The fatal train tracks incident is being investigated by Union Pacific as part of standard policies and the other teenagers will be interviewed.
