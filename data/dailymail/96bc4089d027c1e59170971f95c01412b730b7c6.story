A bungling Romanian government staffer has been sacked after a minister mistakenly handed a gift to his German counterpart with a map of France, not Germany, inscribed on it.

Officials were left red-faced after Germany's foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier received the gift from Romania's  Bogdan Aurescu at the end of a news conference marking 135 years of diplomatic relations.

But what was immediately apparent was that the map on the brochure, filled with the colors of the German flag, was that of France, not Germany.

Pictures show the two ministers grinning and posing for photos as Mr Steinmeier receives the gift unaware the obvious error is being displayed to the world.

Today the foreign ministry said it had fired spokeswoman Brandusa Predescu, saying the incident 'projected a totally unfavorable image.'

Romania also said Mr Steinmeier had responded diplomatically, claiming he hadn't noticed the mistake.

Immediately following the mix-up, Romania's Foreign Ministry apologized, saying it had received the brochure in the morning containing the error from national news agency Agerpres.

Its statement read: 'Due to a regrettable technical error, exclusively on the cover of the booklet, the border of the maps of Romania and France - with the latter being covered by the German flag - was printed.

'The Romanian foreign minister has directly conveyed profound regret for this situation to his German counterpart.'

New agency Agerpres later apologized to both the German and Romanian foreign ministries for the mix-up, as did the printing company. 

It is the second time in just over a month that Romania's foreign ministry has had to apologise for a mistake.

In February the Romanian embassy in Paris sent out invitations for a reception and accidentally attached a spreadsheet with unflattering descriptions of guests such as 'undesirable' or 'ghastly'.
