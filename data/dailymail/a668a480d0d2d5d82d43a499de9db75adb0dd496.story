French gendarmes are hunting for the killer of a former British musician who was killed by a single bullet which passed through his neck and killed him instantly.

Glenn Miller, 65, was found slumped in a corner of his dining room in a pool of dried blood on Sunday morning by a neighbour, it emerged last night. The shocked Frenchman told them his friend was dead and that bloody footsteps were visible on the floor of the room. Another neighbour reported hearing shouting at 11pm on Saturday evening but did not hear the sound of a gunshot.

The visiting neighbour called police to the austere granite farmhouse at the hamlet of Traon Bras near the small village of Plounevez- Lochrist, only a few miles from the Channel coast in northwest Brittany close to the port of Brest.

Gendarmes sealed off the house and organised a search of the surrounding countryside by 25 officers but did not find any trace of the murder weapon or any clues to the identity of the killer.

Described as a kind and pleasant man who liked life in France and who used to walk into the village dressed wearing a leather beret, Glenn Miller had no enemies locally and was popular, said local barman Jacques Goguer, 51.

'His sister who was from England introduced him to us four years ago and said he was her brother.

'We got to know him well. He was from England had played in a band as a guitarist in Canada.

'He had lived here in his house for four years. He inherited the house from his uncle when he died. Glenn's mother was a local French woman from the village and his father was English.

'Latterly he had had a problem with his hand due probably to arthritis. He said he couldn't play guitar anymore because he couldn't move his fingers much. 'He didn't drink a lot and he didn't seem to have a girlfriend. He lived alone in the house.

Another villager Yvon Legadec, 55 said Mr Miller became known in the village for his leather beret.

'Apparently he didn't have much hair. He was a small man and seemed happy enough'.

At a press conference in nearby Morlaix prosecutor Eric Mathais said that results of an autopsy showed a gaping wound to his neck caused by a firearm and that death was instantaneous.

'It is as yet impossibe to say exactly when death occurred and how long he had lain in his house before being found on Sunday morning, 'said M Mathais.

He revealed that the victim lived alone in the house in a state of extreme untidiness.

There was no sign of a struggle with the murderer and no sign of a break in. At the time of the discovery the door of the house was open, he said.

Ten gendarmes working together with detectives from Morlaix are working full time on the case, said M Mathais.

The victim's family in southern England had been contacted and were due to arrive in France yesterday.
