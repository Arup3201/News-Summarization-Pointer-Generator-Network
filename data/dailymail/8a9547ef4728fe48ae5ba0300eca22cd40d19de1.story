She's been rocking a make-up free, low-key look this week on the beaches of Barbados, but, as if to remind us she can scrub up rather glamorously, images of Cara starring in a polished new YSL beauty campaign have just been released.

The model is the face of the beauty and makeup Spring 2014 campaign for the renowned Parisian luxury brand.

The sneak peak of the new campaign sees the 21-year-old showing off the company's new cosmetics range, with a glossy red pout, matching nails and perfect flicked eyeliner.

Standing against a bright red backdrop, Cara wears a belted black dress with a daring cut-away  polka-dot mesh panel.

Cara, who fronted the brand’s adverts for their false-effect Babydoll mascara earlier this year, is following in the footsteps of Claudia Schiffer and Jessica Chastain who have both modelled for YSL beauty.

The model is currently enjoying a break from her work-hard-party-harder lifestyle, holidaying on the Caribbean island of Barbados.

Cara also posed for YSL's Rebel Nude lip glosses this year

Cara shared a snap on Saturday night of her cuddling up to her Barbadian-born pal Rhianna, 25, who has also been staying on the island over Christmas.

The darling of the fashion world also used her holiday to show off a new tattoo.

Cara appears to have had the words 'Don't Worry Be Happy,' perhaps inspired by the 1988 Bobby McFerrin song, tattooed under her breasts.

The inking comes despite having been given a warning from her modelling agency to stay away from the tattoo parlour after getting a distinctive ‘Made in England’ tattoo on the base of her foot.

Cara has been sporting a much more low key look this week on holiday in Barbados, where she revealed her new tattoo
