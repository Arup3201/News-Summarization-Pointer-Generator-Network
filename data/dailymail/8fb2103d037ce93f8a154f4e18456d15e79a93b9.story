Swindon closed the gap on League One leaders Bristol City thanks to a 2-1 win over a Kevin Nugent-led Leyton Orient at Matchroom Stadium.

Michael Smith and Nathan Byrne scored for Town, who held on for a third straight league victory despite Darius Henderson responding for the O's deep into stoppage time.

That result leaves Swindon four points behind Bristol City with a game in hand after the pacesetters drew 1-1 at Walsall, where Romaine Sawyers equalised late on for the Saddlers after Joe Bryan had struck early.

Peterborough also had to settle for a point after a 2-2 home draw against Oldham, with Michael Bostwick and Marcus Maddison netting for Posh but Jonathan Forte and Genseric Kusunga replying for the Latics.

MK Dons took full advantage of Ben Nugent being sent off for Yeovil as goals from Will Grigg and Daniel Powell helped the visitors to prevail 2-0 at Huish Park.

Preston also made a forward move thanks to a 4-2 defeat of Colchester at Deepdale, where Scott Wiseman, Alan Browne, Paul Gallagher and Chris Humphrey all hit the target for North End.

Down at the other end of the table, Crewe remain bottom following a 2-0 loss at Bradford, with Aaron McLean and Gary Liddle doing the damage for the Bantams.

Scunthorpe also continued to struggle as Doncaster came from behind to prevail 2-1 at Glanford Park with goals from James Coppinger and Nathan Tyson, while Port Vale went down 1-0 at Fleetwood after having Jordan Slew dismissed and then conceding a Stephen Dobbie penalty late on.

Shaun Harrad bagged the only goal of the game as Notts County beat Gillingham 1-0, while Barnsley prevailed by the same scoreline at Rochdale through a Peter Ramage strike.

Josh McQuoid and Simeon Jackson appeared to have put Coventry in control against Crawley, but Gwion Edwards and Izale McLeod hit back to make it 2-2 at Ricoh Arena.
