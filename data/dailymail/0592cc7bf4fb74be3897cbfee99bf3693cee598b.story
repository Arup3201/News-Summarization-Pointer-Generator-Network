Tiffany Porter added to that medal haul in the final race of Friday night, winning silver in the 100m hurdles behind Australia's Sally Pearson in 12.80s.

Elsewhere, in the 4x400m relay England qualified with the fastest times of the night in both the men's and women's event.

Scotland made the men's final but the decision to rest Glasgow 2014 poster girl Eilidh Child after her 400m silver on Thursday night cost them, missing the women's final by just 0.24s.

England's women advanced to the 4x100m final despite a dodgy last baton change, although Wales' poor changeover between Mica Moore and Hannah Thomas saw them disqualified.

The English men qualified for the 4x100m final in a time of 38.78s, while Phillips Idowu, Nathan Fox and Nathan Douglas made the triple jump final.
