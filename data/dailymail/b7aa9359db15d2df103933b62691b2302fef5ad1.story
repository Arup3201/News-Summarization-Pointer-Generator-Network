A mother of two buried what she thought was the family cat after finding him dead outside her house - only to realise hours later that their pet was still alive.

Donna Marino found the dead tabby - which looks exactly like her own cat, Billy, on the street near her home in Braintree, Essex.

Just hours after the discovery she had buried the animal in her garden, and said a fond farwell to her companion of seven years.

But, bizarrely, she then heard Billy purring nearby, and was stunned to realise that he had been safe and well all along.

Ms Marino said: 'I thought he had been resurrected and then I thought "Oh no, I have buried the wrong cat"'.

'I gave it such a lovely burial so in a way whoever’s cat it was, at least they know it was lovingly buried'.

She continued: 'A woman knocked at the front gates saying a cat had been hit right outside my door. It wasn’t her that hit it but she wanted to let me know.

'There’s not many cats by us and I have never seen another tabby cat around here. It looked exactly like mine - it was the same size and everything. I was pretty shocked as he never goes near the road.'

Ms Marino is now appealing to find the owner of the cat, so they can be told what happened to their pet.

She said: 'We put him in a blanket. It wasn’t until about an hour later that I heard my cat meow. He was walking from the very place I had just buried him.

'I gave it such a lovely burial so in a way whoever’s cat it was, at least they know it was lovingly buried'.

Now she hopes to track down the owner so they can know what has happened to their pet.
