The war-torn Afghan capital of Kabul was once a place where cinema was outlawed under the fanatical rule of the Taliban.

However, a decade after the brutal regime fell, film makers from Afghanistan have created a celluloid tribute to their battle-scarred city.

Kabul, I Love You has been described as a love letter to the capital, rooted in the grim reality of everyday life for its citizens.

Issues
such as forced marriage, people smuggling, illegal land grabs, land 
mines and ethnic conflict is explored through 10 interwoven stories in the film.

Afghanistan's film industry was hammered by 17 years of war after the Soviet invasion in 1979 and was snuffed out entirely under the extreme rule of the Taliban.

During their 1996-2001 regime, the extremists closed cinemas and hung televisions from lampposts, regarding all images as un-Islamic. Even sculptures were targeted, with the famous giant Buddhas of Bamiyan paying the price.

Now Afghan cinema is struggling to 
re-emerge amid a wrecked economy and an ongoing insurgency against the 
Western-backed government of President Hamid Karzai.

According
to documentary-maker Malek Shafi'i, Afghanistan produces about 100 
films a year but they are usually shot on small budgets and are often 
very poor.

Kabul, I Love You has been funded by the UN mission in Afghanistan, UNAMA, as a means of giving the country's cinema a boost.

Ario Soltani, from UNAMA, says the idea was to encourage film-makers to develop their own ideas.

He said: 'We wanted to reach the film-makers, to support them, to communicate with Afghan people.

'Not with our messages but with theirs. We hope they reflect the Afghan society and the Afghan ideas of that time.'

However, funding the project was not without its problems. One of the 11 directors chosen from 200 applicants fled the country as soon as he got his hands on UNAMA's $8,000, while another left for Iran after being threatened.

However, despite these setbacks, 
shooting for the film was completed and it got a warm reception when it 
was screened at the French cultural centre in Kabul in May.

While
some of the entries betrayed the directors' lack of experience - with 
exaggerated characters, hammy dialogue and a deathly slow pace - other 
showed real flair.

Critics particularly liked the modest and restrained dialogue of Farhad Razae's bitter denunciation of forced marriage.

In the short section - titled Virgin 
Towers - the caretaker of a mosque learns that a pretty young woman in 
his place of worship has fled her family to escape marrying one of her 
relatives.

In the last five years, writers and artists have been pushing boundaries in what remains an extremely conservative society in Afghanistan

The young woman, denounced by a neighbour, ends up running from the police. Her heavy breath and field of vision restricted by the burqa she wears to hide herself allow the viewer to feel the horror of the condition of women in Afghanistan.

Rezae said he based the film on experiences he had as a young man looking after a mosque.

He said: 'During that time, a girl was coming for prayers. She would rest in the mosque two hours after the prayers. I wanted to know who this girl is, but I was ashamed and because of religion, I never asked her what her problems were.'

Shafi'i hailed Rezae's achievement, saying he had 'managed to get closer to Afghan realities' than other film-makers.

Shafi'i added that, in the last five years, writers and artists have been pushing boundaries in what remains an extremely conservative society.

He said: 'Now, people have started to realise that if they cross borders, nothing will happen to them.'

NATO forces are due to depart Afghanistan by the end of 2014 and the precarious security situation they will leave behind is not likely to be conducive to this dream of artistic growth.

It is hoped Kabul, I Love You will send out a message of hope to budding film-makers and other citizens of Afghanistan.
