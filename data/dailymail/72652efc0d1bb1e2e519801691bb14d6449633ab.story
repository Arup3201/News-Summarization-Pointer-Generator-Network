A homeless man has been given a ticket for rummaging through a trash can in the downtown area of one of America's biggest cities.

K.J. as he is known, who is on the streets in Houston, Texas is a 44-year-old Caucasian veteran who has become forced to dumpster dive in order to find food.

The summons he was issued cites his violation as: 'disturbing the contents of a garbage can in downtown central business district.'

Ticketed: A Homeless veteran known as K.J. is ticketed in Houston's business district. His crime? Looking through a trash can in search of food

There are many who are standing behind K.J. and who feel sympathy. Another resident of Houston, Joe Ablaza, has said the city's laws which ban the feeding of homeless people has made K.J. a symbol, not least for the absurdity of it all.

'What little dignity this man has continues to be assaulted by the uncompassionate leadership of this city,' Mr Ablaza writes, in a public Facebook post that has been shared almost 1000 times since the weekend.

In most other cities homeless people are able to rely on the kindness of strangers for food and those who have fallen on hard times are free to dive through the garbage at will, but in Houston even that source of food is banned.

Mr Ablaza explains the city's issues succinctly: 'As you all know, the city of Houston has made it almost impossible for good people to feed the homeless. As a result many have had to revert to searching trash cans for their meals. Apparently we can't have that either.'

Houston's strict 'feeding ordinance law' was passed last April in a 11-6 vote by the City Council.

The laws came into effect in July of last year and they now require people to give Houston City Council notice or receive written permission in order to serve food to the homeless.

Those who register are also required to obtain the consent of public or private property owners before handing out food.

James
Rodriguez, a Houston councilman told News 92 the policy aimed to 
'treat our homeless with dignity, to be more efficient and to protect 
public property.'

Mr Ablaza who is also a veteran, says the city's Mayor Annise Parker leaves the homeless with few options.

He
also calls out the police officer who issued the ticket noting cops in 
other cities have reacted differently: 'Officer J.R. Richards - Dude, 
cut these people a break! Are you a veteran? I mean we have cops in NYC 
giving the homeless boots for crying out loud!'

Houston's laws on food are clearly divisive.Â One twitter user demanded the homeless be ticketed for littering as well, but many are sharing their concern for K.J. and the others who find themselves with little choice.

One Republican Houston activist, Jason Baldwin asked for information on K.J. so he could treat him to a meal.

K.J. will appear in court to face his charges on April 10th.
