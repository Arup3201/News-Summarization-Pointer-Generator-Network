A 100-year-old New York woman has opened up about meeting the love of her life, and staying with him until his death.

In a tear-jerking YouTube video made by Humans of New York photographer Brandon Stanton, the woman, only known as Shirley, speaks lovingly of her late husband Moe.

'We didn't say we were going to get married. We just knew,' she says of their first few encounters. 'It was a meeting of the souls.'

True love: Shirley, 100 years old, has opened up about falling in love with her husband Moe in their youth, and staying with him until the day he died

Shirley is a truly charming character, with a shock of white hair and a tough New York twang to her voice, dressed in a vibrant, multicolored blouse and costume earrings.

She lives alone, but for a yellow labrador and a chocolate colored cat, in a fuchsia pink walled apartment, hung with vivid paintings and sprinkled with nicknacks and memorabilia from her late husband.

They met at a party, she says. 'We had a good time together, and then, around midnight, we were on this couch,' she recalls, indicating the very cherry-red sofa she is seated on, all these years later.

'We would just dance. Not like they're dancing today,' she chuckles, offering a little jig.

'He had very good rhythm, and it was always nice to have his arms around me.'

Three years after the couple married, Moe received an invitation from the president to be a doctor in the war, she explains, pulling out a portfolio full of old letters and drawings he sent her while he was away.

Memories: Shirley says that she and Moe sat on this very couch the first night they met, following a night of dancing, which she demonstrates (pictured) as being nothing like it is today

Perfectly preserved in plastic, one letter begins: 'The ships come and the ships go. But, I stay here, with my thoughts of you, wondering how soon I'll be once more... with my little angel.'

Shirley points at herself animatedly.

Then her voice quivers as she describes Moe's year-long illness, followed by his death.

Lovingly kept: Shirley has devotedly held onto countless letters Moe wrote for her during his time away at the war, many of which include drawings and cartoons

Close to the end of his life, Shirley says she asked of him: 'Moe, what will I do without you?' to which he gave her what can only be described as a heartrending reply.

'Take the love you have for me and spread it around...there, beauty is found.'

As the video ends, Shirley reads out the last of one of Moe's letters to her.

'The stars are joining me in sorrow, while I long without wearying,' it reads. 'To hold you once more in my arms, to embrace you and kiss you and love you.'

Photographer Brandon Stanton, who has dipped his toes into video only recently, has a strong following in New York and beyond, for his truthful photos of the real people he comes across every day as he roams the city.

His magical blend of portraits and poignant, pithy storytelling has earned him more than two million followers online.

Mr Stanton, 29, originally from Georgia and now living in Brooklyn, New York, says he dropped out of college, was fired from his first job as a bond trader and didn't own a camera until four years ago.
