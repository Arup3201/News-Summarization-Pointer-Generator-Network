Matthew Macklin believes the omens are good ahead of his fight in Germany this weekend.

The Birmingham middleweight returns to action against Jose Yebes without his regular trainer Jamie Moore, who was shot in Marbella last month.

But he is taking comfort from the fact he will have his former mentor Joe Gallagher in his corner instead.

'The last fight me and Joe had together was the Felix Sturm fight in Germany so it's funny how life turns out sometimes,’ said Macklin.

'I've enjoyed the last few weeks with Joe, I've had some good sparring.

'There's been great competition in terms of the track and the circuits.'

Macklin, who has fought for a world title three times, admitted it has been a mixed year.

'It has been a funny year. Following the [Gennady] Golovkin defeat, I got my career on track with the Lamar Russ win.

'I thought I'd really push on. I signed for the [Daniel] Geale fight but that was cancelled.

'It was frustrating but I signed with Matchroom and I was ready to fight in Ireland but then what happened with Jamie, happened!

'It's been a funny, funny year but I've put that behind me. I've got a tough fight on Saturday.'
