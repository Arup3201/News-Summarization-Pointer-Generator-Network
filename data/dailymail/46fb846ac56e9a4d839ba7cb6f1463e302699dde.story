Current fashionable family pairings already include Cara and Poppy Delevingne, Edie and Olympia Campbell and Kate and Lottie Moss.

Immy told Vogue that her sister's career had been a big influence on her own. 

She said: 'Suki has shown me that hard work pays off and rejection is a big part of it.'

She continued: 'Like Suki, I'm not typical height-wise for a model (Immy is 6ft 5) - so she advised me to just forget about those stereotypes.'
