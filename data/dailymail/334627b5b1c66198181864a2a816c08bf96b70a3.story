Public trust in David Cameron and George Osborne to steer Britain through the economic crisis has plunged to a record low following last month’s botched Budget.

A new ComRes poll has revealed that almost two thirds of British people do not trust the Chancellor to handle the  economy, while more than half have lost faith in the Prime Minister.

The dire ratings, the worst since both men came to office in May 2010, follow the most turbulent period of Mr Cameron’s premiership.

Pressure to perform: Two thirds of British people don't trust the Chancellor with the economy, while half have lost faith in the Prime Minister

Since the Budget the Prime Minister and Chancellor have faced a furious backlash over the so-called ‘Granny Tax’, the fuel crisis and plans to allow same-sex couples to marry.

The latest poll ratings are likely to fuel growing discontent on the Tory backbenches, with increasing numbers of Conservative MPs accusing Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne of being out of touch with the party and its voters.

The poll, conducted for ITV News, has found that 60 per cent of people do not trust the Chancellor with the economy – up from 52 per cent on last month. Meanwhile, the numbers saying that they would trust him have plunged to 21 per cent.

The proportion who say they trust the Prime Minister has also hit a new low of 31 per cent, down from 36 per cent. The numbers who do not trust Mr Cameron have increased from 47 per cent last month to 53 per cent – equal to the Prime Minister’s worst previous rating.

The March 21 Budget was supposed to cement the Government’s seven-year austerity plan and offer help for those on low incomes. But it triggered a furious backlash over plans to axe tax relief for the elderly and a tax rise on pasties.

Sceptical: The poll finds that the proportion of people who say they trust David Cameron has fallen from 36 per cent to 31 per cent

The proportion who say they trust the Prime Minister has also hit a new low of 31 per cent, down from 36 per cent.

Just days later, the Tories were hit by another scandal following an investigation by newspaper reporters who revealed that a Conservative treasurer offered access to the Prime Minister in return for a hefty donation to the party.

Ministers were also fiercely criticised for triggering panic buying of fuel after they reacted to a potential strike by  petrol tanker drivers by urging motorists to keep their cars topped up and hoard petrol in cans at home.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg’s ratings are also worse, with just 15 per cent saying they have faith in him to run the economy. Labour does not appear to be benefiting, though. Leader Ed Miliband’s trust rating is up just two percentage points to 18 while Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls is unchanged at 15 per cent.
