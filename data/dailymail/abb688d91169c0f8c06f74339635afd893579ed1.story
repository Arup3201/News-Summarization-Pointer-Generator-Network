The family of a 22-year-old Chicago woman gunned down by an
off-duty police detective are suing the city and the officer in connection with
her murder.

At around 1am on March 21, Rekia Boyd was shot in the head
by Det. Dante Servin as she stood with friends outside a property in Chicago’s
Lawndale neighbourhood.

According to James Montgomery the family’s lawyer, Servin
pulled up to the group in an unmarked vehicle and told them to ‘shut up’.

Gunned down: Rekia Boyd was shot and killed during an argument between a group she was standing with and a Chicago police detective

A verbal altercation then began between one of Boyd’s
friends and Servin which culminated in the Chicago policeman firing a volley of
shots at the group.

As the friends scattered Boyd was hit in the head and
39-year-old Antonio Cross was struck in the hand.

Almost 24 hours after the shooting, Boyd died in Chicago’s Mt.
Sinai Hospital while Servin escaped arrest by claiming that Antonio Cross had
approached him with a gun and that he fired in self-defence.

'(He) rolls the window down and says, ‘Hey guys, keep the
noise down.’ At that point, one of the offenders comes at him as he’s sitting
in his car,' said Chicago Fraternal Order of Police spokesman Pat Camden

Tragic: The Chicago Police have admitted that Rekia was an innocent by-stander

'The offender has a weapon in his hand. The officer announced he’s
police – ‘Drop the gun! Police!’

'The offender continues to advance on him, at that point,
the officer fires, in fear of his life.'

While Chicago Police maintain that Cross was armed and that
the shooting was justified, distraught members of Boyd's family told NBC Chicago that he
was carrying a cell-phone.

Gathering evidence: Boyd was with a group of friends around 1 a.m. near 15th Place and Albany Avenue when off-duty Chicago Police Det. Dante Servin pulled up in an unmarked vehicle

Furthermore, Cross has been charged by police with misdemeanor
aggravated assault and to date no weapon has been recovered from the scene.

‘Rekia Boyd was shot
and killed on March 21, 2012, without any legal justification,’ Montgomery said
during a press conference on Friday 6 April to announce the legal action
brought by the family against the city and Servin.

‘Her young life was snuffed out by an aggressive,
intimidating police officer who provoked the confrontation and when met with a
verbal rejoinder took the life of an innocent young woman.’

‘The police spokesperson publicly claimed that the officer
fired in defence of his life when a man approached his vehicle and pointed a
gun at him.

‘Incidentally, no gun was ever found.’

While Chicago Police have not denied that Boyd was an
innocent bystander, Servin, who lives on the same block as the shootings has
not commented.

At the end of March a protest of 200 people took to the
streets of Chicago to raise awareness of Boyd’s death and the fact that
Servin has not been charged.

Unsatisfied: Family attorney James Montgomery demands answers from the City of Chicago and Detective Servin

‘This young beautiful
girl dead in the streets. Why?’ said Boyd's brother, Martinez Sutton in an interview with ABC.

‘All we want to know is what happened?’

While Sutton and Darian Boyd, another brother of the victim
have set up a website and petition to seek justice for their sister, several
witnesses have reported that they believe that Servin was drunk when the
shooting occurred.

Speaking of an apparent history between Servin and the local
community in the Lawndale area, Darian Boyd, the victim’s oldest brother was
reported to have made comments to news outlets about the detective’s attitude.

‘He basically said, ‘What do I have to do to get some peace,
quiet and respect…shoot someone?’

With no party denying that a verbal altercation took place
between Antonio Cross and Detective Servin, the victim’s family are pushing the City of Chicago for answers.

The Boyd family lawyer James Montgomery said the shooting happened simply because
someone "mouthed off" to the officer.

Independent Police Review Authority chief administrator
Llana Rosenzweig said in a statement that they have identified several
witnesses and gathered evidence from the scene.

Investigation: Chicago Police maintain that one of the group Boyd was with produced a firearm which is disputed by witnesses

According to local CBS News Servin is still working with the Chicago Police
Department while his actions are investigated.

'I couldn't believe it,' Martinez Sutton said during the Friday
April 6 press conference.

'I saw a news story about a 22-year-old woman
who had been shot in the head. I was like, I feel sorry for that family. I come
to find out, we were the family.'
