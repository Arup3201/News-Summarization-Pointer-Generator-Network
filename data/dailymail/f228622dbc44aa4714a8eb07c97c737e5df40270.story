One in four Australians admit they do not do any exercise at all, despite the revelation exercise is one of the most powerful anti-depressants.

Dr Tim Sharp, Chief Happiness Officer at The Happiness Institute, says millions of Australians would not only be healthier but also happier if they made exercise a crucial part of every day.

People are putting their mental health at risk when they neglect to make exercise a crucial part of every day, as exercise is 'a natural drug' and a 'potent, underutilised antidepressant'.

Research from The Happiness Institute and Fitness First Australia has found that more than half of all Australians do not do enough physical activity to meet the recommended guidelines from the Australian Department of Health.

A third of those that admit they fail to undertake adequate physical activity say that they feel less happy. Some even reported they never feel happy.

Dr Tim Sharp, Chief Happiness Officer at The Happiness Institute says millions of Australians are putting their mental health at risk when they fail to exercise adequately 

Dr Sharp says exercise is just as important for the mind as it for our muscles: ‘Exercise is just as effective as an anti-depressant, if not more so because it doesn't have the negative side effects'

When we exercise, the body releases endorphins which act as mood enhancers and stress busters

‘Millions and millions of Australians are not taking advantage of the simply strategy of introducing regular exercise,’ said Dr Sharp.

‘Exercise has a profound impact.'

Dr Sharp says exercise is just as important for the mind as it is for our muscles. 

‘Exercise isn’t just about the body. Research shows it has a profound effect on the mind.

‘It is just as effective as an anti-depressant, if not more so because it doesn't have the negative side effects medication can have.’

Dr Sharp has provided tips for how to create 'happy habits', explaining that a positive attitude will lead to taking action in our lives, which results in happy feelings

On his Instagram page, Dr Sharp sends motivational messages to encourage people to have a positive attitude and take action in their lives. This message is often to get up and move

Dr Sharp says many Australians are unaware of the positive effect exercise can have, alleviating many of the psychological issues they may be dealing with.

‘As a psychologist, I’m an advocate of exercise, it does wonders,' said Dr Sharp.

'When we exercise, the body releases endorphins which lifts the mood and alleviates stress. 

‘I often prescribe it to people to improve their state of mind.'

‘Exercise is a mood enhancer and a stress buster. It’s a natural drug, so to speak.

‘There is physiological evidence that when we exercise, the natural hormones and transmitters that are released counteract stress and the damage that stress can do’

'Anyone else finds lifting weight lifts their mood?' Another motivating message from Dr Sharp's Instagram page, advocating exercise to improve one's mental health

A message from Dr Sharp: 'Exercise is the most potent and underutilised antidepressant... and it's free!'

Dr Sharp argues that physical movement is ‘a potent anti-depressant’ – and an extremely underused one

Dr Sharp, who also goes by the name ‘Dr Happy’, says incorporating exercise into a person’s diet is one of those most effective, lasting ways of improving mental health and building a happy life.

‘People often think that it’s easier to take a pill. It seems like a quick fix to take a little pill to change all their problems.’

Dr Sharp argues that physical movement is ‘a potent anti-depressant’ – and an extremely underused one.

‘One of the simplest and most profound contributors to life longevity is a healthy lifestyle.

‘It’s the things we do every day that make the difference, not now and then.’

Dr Sharp says our reasons for exercising largely determine whether or not we will successfully form long-term exercise habits

Another inspiration quote from Dr Sharp (also known as 'Dr Happy'): 'Exercise... My happiness can't live without it!' Dr Sharp says being motivated to exercise to be happy will be more likely to lead to life-long habits, whereas the motivation to exercise look good largely doesn't last long

The leading expert in happiness and positive psychology says a person’s reason for exercising is often key to whether or not they succeed.

Dr Sharp says those who work out for the sole reason that they want to look good are most likely to lose motivation. 

‘The motivation of wanting to look good tends to not last very long,’ said Dr Sharp.

‘When I ask people why they want to exercise, it all comes down to wanting to be happier. It gives them a powerful purpose.

The psychologist practices what he preaces: Dr Sharp says he regularly goes to the gym and enjoys exercising outdoors, and says it is one of the times he is happiest

‘Effective motivations are things like being able to go outside and play with their kids, or being able to enjoy life in their 60s.’

The psychologist regularly goes to the gym and enjoys exercising outdoors, and says it is one of the times he is happiest.

He says exercise is deeply personal and it is crucial that every individual finds a way to make exercise fun for themselves.

‘It we make it fun, we’re more likely to do it,’ explains Dr Sharp.

‘Whether it be adding music, working out with friends, doing a variety of goals or setting a big goal. Whatever works for you.’

Tracking your progress is also key to forming lasting habits and feeling a greater sense of achievement and happiness.

‘Watch your progress – track yourself, set goals and reward yourself,’ explains Dr Sharp.

‘Once we start to progress, we get a sense of satisfaction and pride which is linked to happiness.’

Dr Sharp says enjoying exercise is crucial, which is different for everyone. Making exercise social is a great way to make working out more enjoyable
