This is the dramatic moment Brazilian helicopter police opened fire above a residential area as they chase a suspected drug trafficker though a crime-ridden shanty town.

Video of the incident, which took place in Rio de Janiero's west zone in May last year, sparked fury and widespread criticism of the police after it was shown on Brazilian national television on Sunday.

The footage, taken by the helicopter's thermal imaging camera, shows officers firing several rounds at a car containing drug trafficker Marcio 'The Mathematician' Pereira as it speeds past residential buildings.

Airstrike: Brazilian helicopter police open fire at the suspected drug dealer's car as it speeds through a densely populated shanty town

The drama began after police who had 
been monitoring Pereira, one of Rio's most wanted drug 
traffickers, told a helicopter unit they believed he was in the
 Korea area of Rio.

After officers spotted a man who matched his description, the helicopter swooped down to intercept and opened fire on the car.

As the desperate chase unfolds, the officers can be heard talking to each another.

'It looks like him, right?' one asks.

'That’s right; it looks like him,' a second replies.

Then
 as they swoop in above the car an officer shouts: 'Get it!' and they 
open fire hitting both the car and several buildings close by.

The occupants of the car are seen running through the streets after being
 forced to abandon their vehicle. The suspect escaped but was found dead
 in a parked car the following day

The car was eventually forced to stop and the occupants are seen running through the streets in a desperate bid to escape.

Pereira managed to evade capture but he was found dead in a parked car the following day.

Brazilian authorities are now investigating claims that the officers may have used excessive force.

Martha Rocha, the head of Rio’s Civil Police force, said: 'This image leads us to admit that there could have been a disproportionate action.'

With the Pope due to visit the city in July followed by the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016, Rio is desperately trying to clamp-down on gangs and crime.
