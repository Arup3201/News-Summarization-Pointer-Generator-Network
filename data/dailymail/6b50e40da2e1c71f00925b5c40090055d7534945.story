Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti has again defended Gareth Bale after accusations of selfishness were aimed at the Welshman.

Ancelotti also assured the former Tottenham Hotspur player he still has the backing of the fans.

Bale was booed by certain sections of the Real Madrid crowd at the weekend after he took the ball off Colombian ace James Rodriguez before firing wide.

The fans reaction stems from criticism aimed at the winger last month when he went for goal from a tough angle when teammate Cristiano Ronaldo was in a better position.

Ancelotti was quick to defend his player and reminded those questioning his relationship with the fans that he was also cheered at certain stages of last weekend's win over Real Sociedad.

He said at a press conference: 'Bale being selfish? Gareth is doing everything he can to help the team. The Bernabeu also applauded him two or three times last Saturday.'

Real Madrid face fierce rivals Atletico Madrid at the weekend but have a midweek clash with Sevilla to contend with first.

And Ancelotti has confirmed that he will take each game as it comes and will not rest players for the game on Wednesday.

'I will field more or less the same team that beat Sociedad on Saturday,' said Ancelotti.

'Resting players? The most important game is the one against Sevilla. Not the one against Atletico after that.
