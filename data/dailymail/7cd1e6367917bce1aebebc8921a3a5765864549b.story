Lauren Evenden left her baby near empty alcohol bottles and a tattoo kit. She has lost custody of the child after a court heard she was more interested in playing video games than looking after him

A pregnant mother who left her baby near empty alcohol bottles and a tattoo kit has lost custody of the child after a court heard she was more interested in playing video games than looking after him.

Lauren Evenden's ground-floor flat in Southampton was filthy and unhygienic, a court heard, and when social workers visited the one-year-old baby, he was wearing a sodden nappy and his cot was full of milk bottles.

The 21-year-old, who is pregnant with her second child, failed to take care of her baby, Southampton Crown Court was told. 

Social services took action after several visits to Evenden's ground-floor flat. 

On one occasion they found the little boy in a soiled nappy, while on another he was found lying on a urine-stained mattress.

Further investigations also revealed the mother, who appeared in court wearing a baseball jacket and floral leggings, had failed to take him for his six-week-old check-up and his inoculations had either been late or missed altogether.

Rob Welling, prosecuting, referred to a statement from her previous boyfriend who claimed she was more interested in playing electronic games and watching television than looking after her son.

He said feeding was 'chaotic and disorganised' and described how he would have to force her to get up when the baby started to cry at night.

And when prosecutors discovered the state of the flat, he added: 'It was apparent the baby had been left in his room longer than he should have been.

'He had been neglected and not looked after.'

Social services carried out a further three visits. They found the baby was suffering from a sore because he had been left in a soiled nappy for too long.

They arranged for Evenden to have an appointment with the doctor where she was prescribed a cream to treat the sore but she failed to pick it up, the court heard.

Mr Welling said 'the final straw' came five days later when social services returned to the premises and got no response.

It was later discovered that Evenden had left her child while she went out shopping. When she returned social workers found the baby in his room.

She claimed that she had asked another resident to look after her baby but Mr Welling told the court this person had 'issues of her own' and the child should not have been left with her.

As a result the child has been taken into care and the court was told it was 'unlikely' Evenden would ever get back custody.

In mitigation Jamie Gammon, defending, said Evenden had struggled with child issues and had suffered depression.

However, the court heard she is now living with her mother, things had improved and her situation, with regard to the unborn child, was being carefully monitored by social services.

Recorder Marcus Tregilgas-Davey told Evenden she had failed in her obligations towards his care and welfare over a number of months and that it had not been a single neglect.

He said: 'He didn't receive the care he should have done from his mother.'
