Barack Obama last night refused to choose between Britain and France in a sign that our relationship with the States may not be as special as once thought.

The US president said both France and England are ‘wonderful in their own ways’ and - just like his two daughters - he would never choose between the two countries.

He was speaking at the White House during a state visit by unpopular French president Francois Hollande, whose colourful love life has captured the attention of the world.

Special relationship? Cameron and Obama were also seen joking around during a basketball game

'I have two daughters,' the president 
said, referring to Sasha and Malia. 'And they are both gorgeous and 
wonderful, and I would never choose between them.'

'And that's how I feel about my outstanding European partners. All of them are wonderful in their own ways.'

Obama
 was speaking during a joint press conference with French President 
Francois Hollande, on the occasion of the first State Visit by a French 
head of state since 1976.

The
 move is the latest snub of London, after Secretary of State John Kerry 
angered some in the British government by praising France as America's 
'oldest ally' and part of a coalition of the willing prepared to strike 
against Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, whom he called a 'thug and 
murderer.'

Kerry made no mention of Britain in his speech on Syria, but praised France, Australia and even Turkey.

In a coded swipe at the UK, the President said: ‘A lot of people think something should be done but nobody wants to do it.’

Rivals? UK Prime Minister David Cameron and French President Francois Hollande may both want super-best-friend status with Washington, but Obama is no longer playing favorites

Deteriorating relationship: Cameron and Obama walk side-by-side during the G8 summit last June

Insisting
 that the use of chemical weapons is the ‘kind of offence that is a 
challenge to the world,’ he confirmed the US was considering a ‘limited,
 narrow act’ intended to deter their use.

Weeks later, Cameron failed to get Parliament to vote for the use of military force in the country.

Tory MPs 
feared the vote had inflicting a devastating blow to Mr Cameron’s 
standing at home and abroad – and to the Anglo-US ‘special 
relationship.’

At the time, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said 
last night it would be deeply ‘uncomfortable’ to see the Americans and 
French working together ‘while we stand and watch’.

'The U.S.-French alliance has never been stronger,' Obama said. 'That's good for France. It's good for the United States. It's good for the world, because we share certain values and certain commitments and are willing to act on behalf of those commitments and values.'

Obama appeared to cast aside an episode from the George W. Bush administration that had France refusing to participate in a coalition effort to invade Iraq while the UK led the way.

Within weeks 'French fries' were replaced in high profile eateries – including at least one congressional cafeteria on Capitol Hill – by 'Freedom fries.' And a character on the animated comedy show The Simpsons offered a label for the French that stuck: 'Cheese-eating surrender monkeys.'

Britain, meanwhile, enjoyed favored status in Washington. Then-Prime Minister Tony Blair had famously promised after the 9/11 terror attacks in New York and the Washington, D.C. suburbs that Britain would stand 'shoulder to shoulder' with the American people against a 'new evil of mass terrorism.'

What a difference an election makes! George W. Bush and Tony Blair once personified the 'special' U.S.-UK relationship, partnering in an effort to oust Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein from power

The U.S.-France bilateral talks are happening on a global stage, with the very real possibility of putting England's collective nose out of joint

Despite his projection of a strong relationship between the U.S. and France, Obama offered no word on Tuesday about whether the result would be helpful to England.

A French journalist had noted that he 'actually praised France very warmly today' and granted our President the first state visit of your second term.'

'Does that mean that France has become the best European ally of the U.S. and has replaced Great Britain in that role?'

'Oh, my,' a smiling Obama said, to a round of laughter.

Hollande followed Obama's lead with his own family comparison.

'I have four children,' he said through a translator, 'so that makes it even more difficult for me to make any choice at all.'

'But we're not trying to be anyone's favorite. There are historic links. We share common values.'

'And I can see that our views converge on many issues. But it's not about hierarchy; it's just about being useful to the world.'

Will David Cameron be pressed on Washington's 'special relationship' with London during Prime Minister's Questions?

But the journalist's question wasn't meant to be playful. It continued with a more serious demand about the implications of whether BFF status exists between Washington and Paris.

'If so,' came the zinger, 'why not extend to France the no-spying agreement that you have with England after the big scandal of the NSA’s surveillance program?'

Obama took issue with the premise of the question, cautioning that 'it's not actually correct to say that we have a "no-spy agreement" with Great Britain. That’s not actually what happens.'

'We don’t have – there’s no country where we have a no-spy agreement,' he said.

'We have, like every other country, an intelligence capability. And then we have a range of partnerships with all kinds of countries. And we’ve been in consultations with the French government to deepen those commitments.'
