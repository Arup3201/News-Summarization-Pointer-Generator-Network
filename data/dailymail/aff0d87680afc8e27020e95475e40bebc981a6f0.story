Exploring the world’s treasures in crystal clear oceans can be an exhilarating experience.

But not if you feel like you’re drowning from wearing snorkels that are difficult to use and constantly steaming up.

A new mask that lets you breathe through your nose claims to combat this problem and make first-timers feel like they’re professionals.

The £33 Easybreath claims to feel more natural than traditional snorkeling and prevents fogging

Conventional snorkels are designed to let users breathe through their mouth – a skill that some people find difficult to master.

Rather than covering the user’s eyes with goggles, and then using a separate tube for breathing through the mouth, Easybreath covers the whole face.

This keeps the mouth and nose open so that the swimmer can breathe normally using a double air-flow system. 

Paris-based Triboard said the snorkels will be sold later this year. Designs are expected to come in transparent, blue, green, red, purple and white

The system makes sure that the moist air exhaled is quickly removed and provides the added benefit that the mask, according to its French makers Triboard, will never fog up.

The snorkel tube, which stays above water and releases the exhaled breaths, also features a special valve that seals the tube when the mask is completely submerged.

Goggles used with traditional snorkels can cut off peripheral vision, but Easybreath’s design allows the user to see a much wider view.

Paris-based Triboard said the snorkels will be sold later this year at a price tag of (£33) $54. Designs are expected to come in transparent, blue, purple, green, red and white.

A more radical design was recently unveiled by a South Korean designer Korea which claims to instantly transform the user into a human fish.

The mask, dubbed Triton, acts like a fish gill to extract oxygen from water so that the user can keep on breathing while under the sea.

To use Triton, swimmers would bite down on a plastic mouth piece.

Two arms, which branch out to the sides of the scuba mask, can then function as efficient gills to deliver oxygen.

It may be sometime, however, before the technology is ready to make James Bond-style rebreather possible.

But designer Jeabyun Yeon, who came up with the concept, innovations such as these could  change the way people approach water.
