Coca-Cola is expected to launch a new green product in Australia, made from a naturally sweet plant, in a bid to target health conscious soft drink lovers.

The new carbonated beverage provides a lower-calorie soft drink than Coca-Cola's traditional red can and has more natural ingredients than Diet Coke.

But unlike Diet Coke, which is completely sugar free, Coke Life still has sugar.

The new addition to Coke's range of 3,500 beverages, should also not be mistaken for Coke Zero, which is a low-calorie drink that is marketed at men who don't like the word 'diet' and is meant to taste exactly the same as classic Coca-Cola.

Rosie Huntington-Whiteley launched Coca-Cola Life - sweetened from natural sources with a blend of sugar and stevia leaf extract - in London in September 

Coke Life is roughly inbetween Diet Coke and classic Coca-Cola when it comes to calories – you will still find 27 in a can.

However, it has 60 per cent less sugar than classic Coke because it uses the natural plant Stevia and sugar as sweeteners, rather than just sugar.

Nutritionist Aloysa Hourigan from Nutrition Australia said that Stevia is not known to have any health risks but that doesn't necessarily mean it is healthy to drink Coke Life.

'Nutrition Australia would still say that while it's safe it's still encouraging people to want to eat sweets.

'The problem with all these artificial drinks is they still have high acidity levels and dental erosion.

Coca-Cola Life uses a mix of sugar and natural plant Stevia, which has been in Japan as a sweetener for over 30 years 

Aspartame is a man-made sweetener used as a sugar substitute in some foods and beverages.

The safety of aspartame has been the subject of several political and medical controversies.

However, the European Food Safety Authority concluded in its 2013 re-evaluation that aspartame and its breakdown products are safe for human consumption at current levels of exposure.

People with the genetic condition phenylketonuria are however told to avoid it.

'The other thing is there is some research that suggests that cola based colour drinks, whether sweetened naturally or artificially, are potentially impact negatively on insulin resistance meaning you are more likely to gain weight,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'It is not proven or definite but there is some concern around it. No matter what, the best drink is water and that’s we’d still agree.' 

If you’re wondering what the need for another low-calorie Coke drink is, the global brand which is worth an estimated $74 billion US dollars reportedly wanted a product for the growing number of people who are worried about about artificial sweeteners like Aspartame, one of the most intensively scrutinised food additives.

Aspartame is ingested every day by millions of people around the world in more than 6,000 well-known brands of food, drink and medicine. However, it has been the subject of a number of studies that appear to show harmful effects on human health.

One study linked diet drinks containing Aspartame to premature births, while another suggested it could cause cancer.

However, in December 2013, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reviewed aspartame and confirmed it as safe, so Coca-Cola have continued to use it.

Stevia is the name of the plant from which stevia sweetener (steviol glycoside) is obtained.

You can buy stevia in a powdered form as a sugar substitute that you can add to food and beverages at home – or you may find it in icecream, water-based beverages, brewed soft drinks, plain and flavoured soy beverages. 

It can be used in cooking and baking according to the Stevia Australia website, excepting that it does not caramelise like sugar. 

It has been used in Japan as the main sweetener for over 30 years and safety reviewed by both FSANZ and many other national food standard agencies in other countries e.g the EFSA and USFDA.

FSANZ has concluded that the use of steviol glycosides at proposed levels does not raise any public health and safety concerns.

Coca-Cola Life does not contain Aspartame so may be seen as healthier – but it does contain more sugar than Diet Coke.

'I guess with the other artificial sweeteners there is not a lot of evidence unless they are in very high doses that they are harmful. But because research hasn’t been done checking Stevia it seems to be quiet safe in those respects,’ Ms Hourigan said.

Coke Life is meant to taste similar to classic Coca-Cola but some have noted a slightly aniseed taste to the beverage.

The drink is already available in the UK, US, Mexico, Argentina, Chile and Sweden.

Rival soft drink brand Pepsi have also brought out a drink that uses Stevia as a sweetener in some markets. They have named it Pepsi Next.

Meanwhile, The Sydney Morning Herald has reported Coca-Cola Amatil will soon announce major job cuts to combat a drop in revenues in the Australian beverages business.

Chief executive Alison Watkins is expected to unveil a new profit-sharing structure with The Coca Cola Co in Indonesia.
