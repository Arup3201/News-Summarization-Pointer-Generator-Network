A judge has ruled that the BBC was correct to reject a request by a journalist asking about whether each of the Royal Palaces has a television licence 

A judge has ruled that the BBC should not release information about whether the Queen buys a TV licence because giving out this type of personal data is 'entirely unwarranted.'

The decision was made after an almost two-year battle between Gordon McIntosh, a journalist, and the BBC because the corporation refused to release information to him about whether any of the Royal Palaces - including Balmoral, Clarence House and Windsor Castle - had a television licence.

The lengthy wrangle has seen the request referred to appeal, the Information Commissioner and a tribunal, which all found the BBC was correct to withhold the information.

This means it will impossible to confirm if the Queen and other members of the Royal Family buy a television licence to watch their favourite programmes. 

However many would assume they do, as a number of their preferred shows have emerged in recent years.

Downton Abbey is understood to be a favourite for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. 

Allen Leech, who plays Tom Branson in the drama, revealed Prince William told him he had become a fan of the show after the Duchess of Cambridge gave birth to Prince George.

The Queen is also widely rumoured to be a fan of gentle comedy Last of the Summer Wine. 

Television aerials were also a definite fixture at the Tower of London as in 1986 one of the tower's historic ravens was dismissed from service for eating one.

Mr McIntosh initially wrote to the BBC in December 2012.

He wanted to know whether the £145.50 annual licence fee was paid for televisions at each of the Royal Palaces including Highgrove House and Buckingham Palace, as well as for Westminster.

In the request he wrote: 'I would like to know if the Royal Palaces, including Westminster, have licences for all of their televisions, and if you scrutinise and check in the same way as for residential or commercial premises. 

But the BBC rejected his request - made under the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act - insisting the details were 'personal data' and therefore exempt.

Judge Dhanji ruled determining whether TV licences are bought for the Royal Palaces including Buckingham Palace (above), Balmoral (bottom left) and Highrove (right) was an 'unwarranted' release of personal data

The argument over whether the TV licence information should be released has continued for two years

Mr McIntosh complained and asked the BBC to review its decision, stating that they should have given a list of all properties - for example all the apartments in Kensington Palace - detailing which have licences. 

This was rejected and referred to the Information Commissioner, who backed the BBC. 

The Information Commissioner upheld the BBC's decision saying there was 'a risk individuals could be identified from a full post code', given that there were so few residents in the specified addresses.

'TV Licence holders would have an expectation that the details about their licence held by the BBC would not be disclosed,' the Commissioner found, saying it was hard to see 'how disclosure would meet any specific public interest'.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are reportedly fans of Downton Abbey since Prince George was born

Mr McIntosh argued the decision and said 'a glaringly obvious public interest matter has been, in my opinion, negligently overlooked by the Information Commissioner's Office'.

He said 'reliable sources' had told him many staff and non-royal residents in palace accommodation do not pay for TV licences and that, if they were not being prosecuted due to their 'links to the Monarch', the public should know.

However, Judge Anisa Dhanji, sitting at the tribunal with fellow panel members Michael Jones and Nigel Watson today , said there was 'no evidence' to substantiate the claims, which were denied by the BBC.

She concluded: 'Even if there was a legitimate interest and disclosure was necessary, we consider that disclosure would be unwarranted by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subjects.'

The decision means we will not be able to get an answer to whether the Queen buys a TV licence 

The judge concluded by dismissing suggestions by Mr McIntosh that the Information Commissioner had a 'vested interest in protecting the royal household'.

'There is also no evidence that the Commissioner has acted with anything other than impartially in this case,' she said.

When the BBC earlier asked Mr McIntosh to clarify the addresses he was referring to, he also asked to know how many 'exemption requests' the corporation had received for these premises in the past two years.

He wanted to know: 'Are you pro-actively making, and then following up on licensing requests to these premises and how many requests were made in the last two years to how many 'properties' within the palaces/government residences?'

The BBC replied, clarifying that it was its 'duty to ensure that everyone in the UK who needs a licence has one' and stating that there had been no requests for exemptions from the specified addresses.

Almost 200,000 people are prosecuted a year – one in nine of all lower court cases - and more than 50 people were sent to prison in 2012-2013 for failing to buy a TV licence.

TV Licensing last year released some of the worst excuses for failing to pay. 

These included one person who said: 'Apparently my dog, which is a corgi, is related to the Queen's dog so I didn't think I needed a TV Licence. 

Another person said they thought they could avoid the charge because they spent a lot of time watching television at a neighbour's house.
