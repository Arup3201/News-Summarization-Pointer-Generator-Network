A genetic counsellor has helped predict the face of the teenage offspring of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

Since the couple announced the pregnancy in December, artists and forensic experts from across the globe have put forward their impressions of the how the world's most eagerly anticipated baby will look.

But South Africa-based genetic counsellor Suretha Erasamus has gone further and is one of the first to predict the face of the royal in adolescence.

Face of a royal? If the couple have a daughter it is predicted she will look like her mother and have a good chance of inheriting Kate's dark hair but may inherit William's mouth and strong jawline if it is a boy

Ms Erasamus works with families to help them understand and make decisions about genetic conditions.

But she has taken her skills and helped create a best guess of what the future King or Queen will look like.

Graphic artist Theuns Kruger developed the images based on her predictions.

With their strong jawlines and bright 
blue eyes, the resemblance between the images of the teenage girl and 
boy and their parents is clear to see.

And as well as their parents, Ms Erasamus believes the teenage royal will 
share many of the features of its paternal grandmother Princess Diana.

However she does not think it likely that the child will have her famous blonde hair. 

The mock-up of a girl as a toddler has large eyes similar to Kate's, while the young boy bears a striking resemblance to William as a small child

If the baby is a girl, Erasamus
believes she will inherit the good looks of the Duchess of Cambridge, 
including the full eyelashes and defined eyebrows.

However, instead of Kate's green 
eyes,  teenage princess is depicted with the blue eyes of
Princess Diana and Prince William.

The teenage girl in the computer 
generated image has strong echoes of both Kate and Princess Diana but also 
shares a likeness to Prince William's first cousins Eugenie and 
Beatrice.

If the Duke and Duchess have a boy, then Erasamus believes he will much more closely resemble his father as a teenager.

It is predicted the baby will have his mother's dark hair rather than the blonde hair of its paternal grandmother

However, she said the baby is likely to bear some of the facial characteristics of Princess Diana because of the strong resemblance between Prince William and his mother

In the image, he shares William's strong jawline and has his mouth and teeth.

But he will have the darker, arched eyebrows of his mother.

Such is William's strong likeness to 
his mother that Erasamus believes there is a good chance the royal baby will
also look similar to Princess Diana.

However, she said there is a good chance the baby will inherit Kate's dark hair, as dark genes are stronger than light ones.
