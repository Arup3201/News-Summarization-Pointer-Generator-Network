Next time you're swatting away a bee, it will be all too apparent what areas of the body to protect - thanks to the research of Michael Smith.

The Cornell University student has made a series of painful conclusions into stings by letting honey bees attack every part of his own person.

Smith subjected himself to several stings a day to his face, arms and genitals to map out what section of the body was most sensitive to the barbs.

After weeks of research Smith found that although stings to his penis and testicles were uncomfortable, the worst place for a bee to attack was the nostril.

Ouch: Cornell University graduate student Michael Smith subjected himself to five bee stings a day for 38 days and ranked the pain associated with stings collectively. He determined the most painful was a sting on the nose, giving it a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10 ¿ higher than on the upper lip (8.7) or penis (7.3)

Science of stings: Cornell student Michael Smith researched the most painful places for a bee to attack

His usual idea for the study came about when the bee enthusiast was discussing the problems of working with hives with his academic adviser. 

'We speculated it probably really would 
hurt to get stung in the testicles. Two days later, by 
chance, I did get stung there. It didn't hurt as much as I expected it 
to,' he told the Independent.

Smith measured the stings with a pain rating of 1 for mild and 10 for extremely painful:

1) Nostril  - 9.0             6) Cheek - 7.0

2) Upper lip - 8.7          7) Armpit - 6.7   

3) Penis - 7.3               8) Nipple - 6.7 

4) Scrotum - 7.0              9) Middle finger tip - 6.7

5) Palm - 7.0               10) Abdomen - 6.7        

Intrigued by his 'eureka' moment, Smith chose 25 locations on his body to measure the level of pain. He then held a bee to those areas and allowed it to sting him.

Like all scientific studies he needed to repeat his experiment several times so, over the course of 38 days, he administered five stings a day.

Each body part was stung three times during the experiment, and the pain level was given a mark out of 10.

Because the experiment needed a control, he also had to let a bee sting his forearm at the start and end of each day's research.

His research raised some unusual problems, including being able to maneuver a bee to the more hard-to-reach body parts.

'Some locations required the use of a
 mirror and an erect posture during stinging (e.g., buttocks),' he wrote
 in his study, which has been published in PeerJ.

The
 results were surprising, with Smith finding that although stings to the
 genitals were painful, there were worst places to be stung. 

'There’s
 definitely no crossing of wires of pleasure and pain down there. But if
 you’re stung in the nose and penis, you’re going to want more stings to
 the penis over the nose, if you’re forced to choose,' he told National 
Geographic.

Experiment: Smith held bees to his body so he could research the most painful sites for stings

Pain map: To be sure of his results, Smith administered three bee stings to 25 locations on his body

'I really don't want to get sting in the 
nose again – that's not fun. Your body really reacts. You're sneezing, 
wheezing. Your eyes are streaming,' he added.

Smith admitted that there were times when he regretted embarking on his experiment, and said he was glad his supervisor, Tom Seeley, had talked him out of testing stings to the eyes.

'He was concerned that I might go blind. I wanted to keep my eyes,' Smith said. 

The graduate's fascination with bees 
has formed the basis of his research at Cornell's Department of 
Neurobiology and Behavior, where he is studying honeybee colonies.

While
 studying molecular biology at Princeton in 2009 he founded the 
Princeton University Bee Team, which has led to the creation of two 
hives on the university campus.

He also runs the College Beekeeper group, which advises students on how to get hives up and running.

Dedication: Smith, a graduate student researching hive colonies, also promotes beekeeping at universities

While measuring pain is subjective, and the study used only one person's measure of pain, Smith has no plans to further his research into bee stings.

'I didn’t see a lot of merit in repeating this with more subjects,' he said.

And for those wanting to avoid accidentally repeating his experiment, Smith advised: 'If you have a bee buzzing around you and 
you think it's peeved, if you calm down, don't breathe a lot – they are 
attracted to carbon dioxide – and slowly walk away, you will be fine. 
Most stings are probably wasps.'
