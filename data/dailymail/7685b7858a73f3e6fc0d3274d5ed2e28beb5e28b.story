Southampton are set to miss out on Wesley Sneijder with the midfielder edging towards a move to Juventus.

Sneijder is looking for an escape route out of Galatasaray this month, news that has put Saints boss Ronald Koeman on red-alert.

Koeman admitted in December that he was keen on a move for Sneijder, who has been offered to the Saints, Manchester United and Manchester City.

But Juve have now entered the hunt for the Holland international and are now thought to be leading the race for the midfielder.

Having joined Galatasaray in January 2013, Sneijder is keen to leave Istanbul this month.

Likewise, Galatasaray chiefs are ready to consider offloading the talented midfielder as they look to ease their debt problems.

Newly appointed chairman Duygun Yarsuvat has been handed the task of easing the club's precarious financial position.

Sneijder earns in the region of £2.5million-a-year at Galatasaray; and the club have failed to pay the 30-year-old on time on more than one occasion over the past few months.

And the Turkish side have been receptive to the notion of selling Sneijder in an attempt to ease their wage bill.

It is understood Galatasaray are demanding in the region of £9million for Sneijder.
