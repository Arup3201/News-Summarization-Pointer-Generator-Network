England's World Cup winning captain Bobby Moore has been immortalised with his own waxwork model by Madame Tussauds.

The cultured defender is best remembered for leading the Three Lions to victory in the 1966 World Cup final staged on home soil at Wembley.

The figure reflects this memory with Moore appearing in the same vintage red England strip and holding the Jules Rimet Cup.

Fod memories: Bobby Moore's daughter Roberta loves the way the makers have captured his smile

It was unveiled at the home of Moore's former club West Ham United - the Boleyn Ground. The waxwork was commissioned after an overwhelming 90 per cent of people chose him in a London poll asking which footballing great should be honoured ahead of this summer's World Cup in Brazil.Moore's daughter Roberta said: 'I remember going to Madame Tussauds with my dad when I was a little girl for the unveiling of the original wax figure so this has brought back very fond memories

'Madame Tussauds have really done an amazing job, the new figure really captures his smile which made me cry! I feel very proud.'
