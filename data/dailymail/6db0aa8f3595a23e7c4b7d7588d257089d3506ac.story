American fashion label Abercrombie and Fitch has been accused of defacing its store on London's prestigious Savile Row after painting one of the upstairs rooms brown.

The leisure-wear chain met with protests when it announced it was moving to the Grade II listed store in London's upmarket Mayfair in 2013.

And now tailors from the surrounding boutiques have accused the brand of defacing the store after they painted a first floor room brown.

Abercrombie and Fitch has been accused of defacing this Grade II listed building on Savile Row after tailors on the exclusive street say they painted an upstairs room brown without the colour being agreed on

The conditions attached to a Grade II listed building mean that any colour scheme on the ground or first floor must be agreed with the council before going ahead (stock images of Abercrombie interior)

Westminster Magistrates’ Court was told that the conditions of Grade II status meant that any colour scheme on either the ground or first floor had to be agreed with the council beforehand.

Court papers accuse Abercrombie of breaching this condition on March 24 last year at their 3 Savile Row shop.

Protesters have long objected to the Ambercrombie Store, saying its all-American leisure clothing is out of keeping with the famously upmarket street of largely British tailors. 

Prosecutor Warwick Tatford, on behalf of Westminster Council, asked for a delay so a senior barrister could review the case.

He said: ‘It’s a complicated matter and needs to be looked at in the round, and which companies are the appropriate defendants.

‘We also need to consider the merits of the case, which involve a certain amount of artistic judgement that involves looking at the painting of walls.’

The fashion chain's Savile Row store has long been the source of criticism, as people feel its all-American leisurewear is out of keeping with the upmarket, traditionally British boutiques on the street

He said the barrister for the prosecution was currently ill, but added: ‘It is hard to anticipate a trial, either the case will be withdrawn, which is unlikely, or there will be a guilty plea with potential substantial mitigation.’

Abercrombie and Fitch are in the dock along with with Dorset based Castletech Construction.

They both face the same charge of failing to comply with a condition in a listed building contrary to the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.

If convicted, they face a maximum £20,000 fine.

Magistrates adjourned the case until March 25 for further assessment of the case. Both companies have yet to enter a plea.
