Support: Prince William is patron of the wildlife charity Tusk

Prince William was last night urged to cancel his visit to a wildlife park in China where elephants are forced to dance, play football and perform degrading circus tricks for crowds of tourists.

The Prince, a keen conservationist, is due to round off a solo trip to Japan and China next month with a visit to Wild Elephant Valley in Xishuangbanna. The popular tourist attraction set in a nature reserve is home to some of China’s last remaining wild elephants.

William, who is patron of the Tusk wildlife charity, will also see the reserve’s Wild Elephant Walkway, which has been credited with helping to double the wild elephant population in China’s Yunnan province in the past two decades.

What the Prince may not realise, however, is that just 400 yards away, captive elephants are forced to perform to thousands of visitors a day in a shoddy arena that draws crowds from across China.

Chained by their legs in dingy pens between performances, the wretched-looking elephants go wearily through a routine that involves kicking footballs into a goal, dancing to disco music and forming a pyramid, four times a day.

In depressing scenes witnessed by The Mail on Sunday on Friday, one elephant is spun around on a wheel to music while another is made to put on a pair of glasses, before picking a ‘girlfriend’ from the audience and kissing her with its trunk.

When the shows are over, the weary elephants – led by handlers carrying bullhooks – take tourists on rides around the arena for £8 a circuit or pick up tourists by their trunks for a few seconds for £4.

Most of the performing elephants, which experts say are subjected to brutal ‘breaking’ rituals to tame them, have had their tusks sawn off. One handler explained: ‘We do it to make it safer for people. It also stops the elephants injuring the performers or each other.’

In the breaking rituals, according to animal welfare groups, young elephants are separated from their mothers, and then beaten and deprived of food and water for up to a week to make them subservient to trainers. The shows – Wild Elephant Valley’s biggest draw – are highly lucrative, with up to 15,000 tourists a day paying £6.50 each.

Word about Prince William’s visit has spread rapidly among excited park employees. Li Wei, 36, who works as a compere at the elephant shows, said: ‘He is very handsome. I don’t know if he will come to see our show but I hope that I get the chance to meet him.’

Wretched: The animals are chained in pens and have their tusks cut off

In its brochure, the park – which is operated by a tourism company set up by the local government – says the animals used in performances are rescued wild elephants, which have been injured or abandoned in the reserve.

The news will alarm animal welfare groups, which believe rescued animals should be released back into the wild. William is due to meet one of four elephants rescued from poachers during his visit on March 4.

Yesterday, in the park’s rescue centre, we found a distressed young elephant left alone in a concrete enclosure. Wardens told us it had been rescued after being orphaned in the wild, but refused to say if it was the one William would see, or if it would be trained for the shows.

The park declined to answer questions about the Prince’s visit.

Louise Rogerson, of the Elephant Asia Rescue and Survival Foundation charity, said: ‘I applaud William for visiting China to address wildlife conservation issues, but do not feel he should be endorsing circus performances involving abused elephants. Any elephant forced to perform is subjected to immeasurable cruelty to do the unnatural tricks it has been trained to do. These barbaric performances should be brought to an end.’

Elephant shows are banned or restricted in 30 countries including Mexico and the Netherlands, which has also introduced total bans on animal performances. The RSPCA is trying to ban them in Britain but legislation has so far been blocked.

The number of wild elephants in Yunnan province has reportedly doubled to about 300 in the past few years thanks to the reserve, government-financed feeding programmes and laws which threaten poachers with the death penalty.

Excited: Li Wei, 36, who works as a compere at the elephant shows, is hoping the Prince pays a visit

A Royal source said last night: ‘The Duke’s visit is to learn about emerging indigenous Chinese approaches to conservation. His time at Wild Elephant Valley is not to judge or condone, but to gain a greater understanding of the challenges in a part of the world where developments in conservation are critical to the elephants’ survival.’

There was yet more embarrassment for Prince William last night after it emerged that HSBC and PwC – both accused of encouraging tax avoidance – are sponsoring an event he is due to attend on his visit to China.

The Prince is set to appear at next month’s The GREAT Festival of Creativity, which is designed to showcase British creativity and business.

More than 500 UK companies will use the Shanghai festival, which has been co-ordinated by UK Trade & Industry, to reach a global business audience.

Scandal-hit HSBC, which is facing an investigation over allegedly helping customers dodge tax, and consultants PwC, which the Public Accounts Committee said promoted tax avoidance on an ‘industrial scale’, are sponsoring the event.

Richard Murphy, of Tax Research UK, said: ‘Prince William is in a predicament, or people are putting him in one.

‘Why is he being asked to compromise himself in this way? This conference shows that companies which have worked to undermine the taxation revenue of this country are part of the establishment in this country. The two are inextricably linked.’
