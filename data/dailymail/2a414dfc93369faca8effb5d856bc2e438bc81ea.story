A Tory MP has claimed he would not care if fellow backbencher Nadine Dorries was eaten by a snake while taking party in I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here.

Gordon Henderson condemned her decision to abandon Westminster for a month to appear on the ITV show, and said she should be representing her constituents.

Ms Dorries was suspended from the Tory party after jetting off to the jungle without getting permission from David Cameron.

Nadine Dorries, the Mid Bedfordshire MP, angered Tory colleagues and constituents after jetting into the jungle

During the Bushtucker Trial, Rotten Rhymes, Nadine Dorries had to eat ostrich anus and camel toe

She angered colleagues and 
constituents with her claim that she would use her appearance to promote
politics, including discussing lower the abortion time limit.

Instead
viewers have watched her eating ostrich anus and performing a woeful 
stand-up routine with Linda Robson from Birds of a Feather.

Mr Henderson, the MP for Sittingbourne 
and Sheerness, was asked about her appearing on I'm A Celebrity... Get 
Me Out of Here! at a youth surgery at Sittingbourne Baptist Church.

He said: ‘I don't approve of what she's 
doing. I think Members of Parliament are elected to represent their 
constituents and you can't do that from a jungle in Australia.'

As MPs prepared to return to the Commons this week, Ms Dorries was in the jungle performing a woeful comedy routine with Linda Robson from Birds Of A Feather

He went on: ‘If she was swallowed by a python and
never came back to Westminster I wouldn't lose too much sleep over it,’
the Kent Messenger reported.

‘If she wanted to connect with people
she should have talked to people face-to-face. I don't have to go to 
Australia to do that.’

Bookies have made Ms Dorries favourite to be voted out of the show.

Tory MP Gordon Henderson told a meeting of young people he would not care if Ms Dorries did not return to Westminster

Jessica Bridge of Ladbrokes said: ‘Nadine's as popular with punters as she is with the Conservative party and the odds suggest her time in the jungle is up.’

Ms Dorries will face a showdown with Chief Whip Sir George Young when she returns to the UK.'It will be a meeting without coffee,' said a senior Tory source.

The MP for Mid-Bedfordshire triggered a storm of outrage when she jetted off to the jungle for a month when she should have been in Westminster.

Earlier this week one of her Ms Dorries' daughters insisted she was cleared to take part in I'm A Celebrity by former Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell before he resigned last month.

Jennie Dorries told ITV's Daybreak that Mr Mitchell agreed that her mother could take the time off.

She said: ‘She did ask for the month off. The chief whip gave her permission. She did all she had to do before she left. She made arrangements for someone to take her place on Remembrance Sunday.’

But Mr Mitchell is adamant that no conversation was had about being away from Parliament for a month, and certainly not to be a contestant on the ITV show fronted by Ant and Dec.

‘Conversations between the Chief Whip and colleagues are confidential,’ a spokesman for Mr Mitchell said.

‘But in this case Andrew is happy to confirm that permission to go to Australia for one month to take part in I’m A Celebrity was neither sought nor was it given.’
