Tragedy struck a newlywed couple and two of their family members as they vacationed in the Caribbean.

Kush Patel and his cousins, brothers Jay and Shivang Patel, all jumped into the water when Kush's new bride, Kajal, was swept up in the current as the group was enjoying a holiday with eight other friends and family members at Macao Beach in the resort town of Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic.

All four, whose ages ranged from 27 to 30, were killed.

'It’s really heartbreaking,' cousin Dhrupad Patel told CBS Philly.

'They were beautiful. I love them.'

And despite claims from authorities in the Dominican Republic that there were signs prohibiting swimmers in they area, the family claims there was no such thing, and that the four had no idea what could happen when they got into the water.

Furthermore, the family claims it took 90 minutes for help to finally arrive. 

All this while friends and family, including Shivang’s girlfriend and Jay’s wife, helplessly looked on.

Jay and his wife just welcomed a baby boy, who is only two months old.

Kush and Kajal had just been married in November.

The incident occurred at Macao Beach in the resort town of Punta Cana

‘I can’t say anything. I lost my son,” said Summant Patel (above), Kush's father, as he was comforted by a friend

'We saw the wedding, it was beautiful,' said Dhrupad.

‘I can’t say anything. I lost my son,” said Summant Patel, holding a photo of Kush and his daughter-in-law Kajal.

The families are now in the process of having the four bodies returned to Philadelphia.
