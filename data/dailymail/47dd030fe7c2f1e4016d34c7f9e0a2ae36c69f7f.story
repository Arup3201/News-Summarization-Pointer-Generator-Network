Despite the disturbing claims issued today against 7th Heaven actor Stephen Collins, his on-screen wife Catherine Hicks has come out in his defense  - calling him a 'good' guy.

Hicks, who played matriarch Annie Camden on the decade-long show about a pastor and his wife who have seven children, was filmed Tuesday walking in a Santa Monica hospital parking garage where she was asked about the tapes in which Collins admits to molesting several girls between the the ages of 10 and 13.

The actress smiles and says she heard news of the allegations but that there was never an indication he was an abuser from their years on set where they worked with several underage actors and actresses.

'Stephen is a good guy in my opinion,' she says.

Catherine Hicks was walking through a parking garage in Los Angeles on Tuesday when she was stopped by a reporter asking about allegations her former co-star Stephen Collins is a child molester. She said 'Stephen is a good gut in my opinion' 

Collins and Hicks played the Reverend Eric and Annie Camden on the show that ran from 1996 to 2007 (pictured kissing for the cameras at the 2001 Teen Choice Awards on the left, and with the entire case on the right)

On Tuesday, TMZ published recordings of a marriage therapy session between Collins and his then wife Faye Grant, where he talks in detail about several instances where he exposed himself to young girls, and forced at least one to touch him. 

He has since been fired from a small role in the Ted sequel, and resigned from his position on the national board for the Screen Actors Guild. 

Both the NYPD and LAPD are looking into the claims of sexual assault, and it's believed that there were at least three victims.  

Hicks and Collins played Rev Eric and Annie Camden on the hit show from 1996-2007. A few members of the central cast recently reunited for a dinner last month, and Collins posted a picture of the get together on his Twitter. 

Actress Jessica Biel got her start on the show and has since married fellow actor and musician Justin Timberlake. She attended the dinner and is pictured next to Collins in the reunion shot.
