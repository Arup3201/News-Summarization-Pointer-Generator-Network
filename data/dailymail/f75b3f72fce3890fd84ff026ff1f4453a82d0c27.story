Controversial: Tom Winsor, pictured, author of two reports calling for radical reform of police pay and conditions, has been selected for the role of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary

Leaders of rank-and-file police reacted with fury last night to the decision to appoint a civilian to be their chief watchdog.

The Police Federation – which is fighting threats to pay and perks – said the selection of Tom Winsor as Chief Inspector of Constabulary ‘beggared belief’.

The former rail regulator wrote two reports proposing a radical shake-up of policing which caused deep resentment among officers.

Mr Winsor endorsed a normal retirement age of 60 and the scrapping of a series of allowances and special payments.

And he has proposed officers who work anti-social hours should be paid more.

He also said chief constables should have the power to make officers redundant.

On Thursday he was named as the Home Office’s preferred candidate to replace Sir Denis O’Connor and was chosen ahead of two Chief Constables for the £200,000-a-year post.

John Apter, chairman of the federation’s Hampshire branch, said: ‘Tom Winsor has very little experience of policing and has attracted criticism from the rank and file over the way he has conducted his reviews into police reform.

‘The Home Secretary will have her own reasons for choosing Mr Winsor over other credible candidates – at this time I am struggling to understand what they might be.’

But ministers insisted Mr Winsor was the right man for the job and would be independent both of the police and the Government.

Cuts fury: Officers jeer Theresa May as she backs Tom Winsor's policing reforms - which would include fitness tests and pay cuts for some officers - as she appears at the Police Federation annual conference last month

Police minister Nick Herbert told the 
Today programme yesterday: ‘The direction of travel over the last few 
years has been to ensure that the inspectorate is more  independent, not
just of the government ... but also of the police service itself.’

Federation chairman Paul McKeever was
left humiliated during the interview after he suggested senior 
officers were set to resign over the appointment.

But he then admitted he had spoken to
just ‘one middle ranking officer’. Mr McKeever said: ‘He is not just 
there as a regulator, he is there to give, hopefully, sagacious advice 
from a profound understanding of policing.

‘He is going to be in some very 
high-powered meetings on occasions where the Prime Minister and Home 
Secretary say, “Tom, what do you think?”.

‘And he is not going to know. He’s going to have to say, “Look,  I’m going to have to phone one of my advisers”.

‘That is not a position we should have somebody in who is going to be giving advice to government.’

Last month thousands of police marched to protest over changes to pay, conditions and pensions.

Police shake-up: The appointment of Tom Winsor has sparked further anger among rank and file officers, just weeks after Home Secretary Theresa May was heckled at the Police Federation conference

Mr Winsor is unpopular among officers
after he proposed cutting bonuses and introducing compulsory fitness 
tests in his wide-ranging review of policing.

Among the more 
controversial proposals in his two reports, Mr Winsor recommended that 
police constables' starting salaries should be cut by up to £4,500 and 
that the retirement age should be raised to 60.

Controversial choice: Theresa May risks angering rank and file police officers by choosing lawyer Tom Winsor as her preferred choice as the next Chief Inspector of Constabulary

His
suggestion that chief constables should have the power to sack officers
were described by Federation leaders as ‘meddling with the very bedrock
of British policing’.

Mr Winsor, a lawyer and former rail 
regulator, was selected following an interview process conducted by the 
Home Secretary, Theresa May.

Thames Valley chief constable Sara 
Thornton, and the top officer in the West Midlands, Chris Sims, who is 
also a senior figure in the Association of Chief Police Officers, are 
understood to have applied but lost out.

Sir Denis O’Connor, the incumbent, is retiring this summer.

Before his appointment is confirmed, Mr Winsor faces a grilling by the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee, which has vocally criticised how his reports were compiled.

Bridget Phillipson, Labour MP for 
Houghton and Sunderland South, said she was 'stunned' by the decision, 
saying she could not even believe reports that Mr Winsor had applied.

Matt Cavanagh, of the Institute for 
Public Policy Research (IPPR) think-tank, saying he was a 'risky if not 
reckless choice' which could damage the reputation of Her Majesty's 
Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC).

'As well as putting the relationship 
between Government and the police under further strain, this provocative
choice could put at risk the growing reputation and contribution of 
HMIC at a crucial time.'

Home Office minister Lynne Featherstone said Mrs May was 'probably' right in recommending Mr Winsor for the role, but added he still had hurdles to overcome before his appointment.

'If Theresa May has Tom Winsor as her
preferred candidate then she probably has very good reason to have him 
in that way,' she said.

'The fact that he is not from a police background is innovative and it may be brilliant.'

She
told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there were 'still hurdles for Tom 
Winsor to pass' because he must prove to the Home Affairs Select 
Committee 'he has the understanding to do the job'.

'Theresa believes he can, I believe Theresa is probably, almost certainly, right.'

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Tom 
Winsor has been named as the preferred candidate for the role of Her 
Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary.

‘He will appear before the HASC before the appointment goes to the Prime Minister and the Queen for approval.’

Labour’s former home secretary David Blunkett said it was 'a very odd moment' for Mr Winsor to be named preferred candidate for the HMIC role when the police are dealing with cuts and many officers are up in arms about his reports.

Mr Blunkett told BBC Radio 4’s World At One: 'It is almost like poking a stick through the bars of the lion’s den, at a moment when the police service are most on edge and most subject to disagreement and friction.

Problems: The move has prompted anger and surprise among rank-and-file officers, with much criticism focusing on Mr Winsor's lack of policing experience

'I think the Home Secretary has taken
a deliberate decision to say to the service ‘Not only are we not 
backing off to your objections to Tom Winsor, we are not actually going 
to be listening to your cry of pain in terms of what’s happening to the 
service as a whole’.'

He added: 'I have certainly no objection personally to Tom Winsor, nor in principle to bringing him in from outside.'

But he said it was 'not the role' of the Chief Inspector to force 
through Government reforms, but to offer ministers independent advice.

'The Home Secretary needs advice,' 
said Mr Blunkett. 'She has abolished the Police Improvement Agency, the 
police authorities are being replaced by elected Police and Crime 
Commissioners, the Association of Chief Police Officers is effectively 
being dismantled. Where is that advice going to come from?

'It can’t come from someone who is not rooted in the service and is seen by the police service as antagonistic.'
