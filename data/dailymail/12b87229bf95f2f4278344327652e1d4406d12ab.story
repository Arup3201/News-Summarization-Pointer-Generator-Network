Jose Mourinho insists he had nothing to do with Diego Costa’s omission from the latest Spain squad.

Costa has been struggling with injuries this season, first with his hamstring and now with a pelvic problem.

He has been nursed carefully through games but will start at Liverpool on Saturday and then take a two-week break from competitive football after Vicente del Bosque left him out of the Spain squad.

Del Bosque's team play Belarus in a Euro 2016 qualifier on November 15 before facing Gemany in a friendly three days later.

Asked about Costa's omission from the Spain squad, Mourinho added: 'I am pleased yes, but I want to make it clear I did nothing for that to happen. 

'That 15 days finally he can rest and work properly. It’s fantastic news for us, and I want to thank the Spanish federation for the decision but I want to make it clear I did nothing for that to happen.

'He will have a period of complete rest immediately after the match. No treatment. No massacre on his muscle. Just rest. Then continue the specific work he’s doing without having a match. 

Mourinho was unhappy when Costa was selected by Spain manager Vicente del Bosque last month

'It’s very good news for him and us and also for the national team. Now he has to go in the right direction. It’s good for Spain to have a good Diego and not a so-so Diego.'

Mourinho also confirmed that forward Loic Remy is also available for selection following a groin injury, giving him a fully-fit squad to choose from.
