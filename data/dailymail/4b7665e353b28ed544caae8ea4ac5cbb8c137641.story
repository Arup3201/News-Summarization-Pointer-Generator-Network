A young filmmaker has remade one of the most successful movies ever - Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark - by putting his family puppy in the starring role.

Zach King, 23, from Portland, Oregon, used his Boxer puppy Indy to create a short homage to Steven Spielberg's action classic called Indiana Bones and the Raiders of the Lost Bark.

The five minute film recreates famous scenes from the original movie, including when Harrison Ford's character uses his whip to swing across a gap and also the moment he rescues his hat from under a closing door.

It also features Indiana Bones running to escape a giant rolling boulder.

But rather than facing evil Nazi soldiers looking for world domination, the canine Indy has to face a rather cuter enemy - kittens.

It is the latest in a number of animal based remakes that Mr King has produced including Jedi Kittens and Jedi Kittens Strike Back.

Mr King said it took him and his friend Jadon Gauthier several days to film the Indiana Bones film, which charts the puppy searching for his lost bark.

They created outfits and props for the animals out of pieces of cardboard. 

Writing on his YouTube channel FinalCutKing, he said: 'This video was created with 3 rolls of duct tape, 108 glue sticks, 18 large boxes of cardboard, a few all nighters with an adorable puppy.'

Mr King has even had a special film poster by artist Josh Kenfield made to go along with the movie.

Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, directed by Stephen Spielberg in 1981, is one of the highest grossing movies ever made and won five Oscars.

The original Indiana Jones films starred Harrison Ford in the lead role as the whip cracking archaeologist and were some of the most successful action movies ever made by combining comedy, fantasy and adventure 

Artist Josh Kenfield produced a movie poster based on the original to go with the spoof Indiana Bones film

He is already well known on Vine for his cleverly edited six second videos that appear to show him doing impossible magic tricks. 

A cinema and media arts graduate he won YouTube's NextUp Creators Contest in 2013.

Earlier this year Mr King told the Independent that he would like to move on from short films to one day direct his own action adventure feature film.

He said: 'Someday I would love to direct feature films – action-adventure titles would be the dream genre to produce.

'But I'm loving being an online content creator right now and I have a large audience so I want to keep creating content for them.'
