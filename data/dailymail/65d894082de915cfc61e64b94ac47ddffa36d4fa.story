A woman who was stabbed in a 'horrific' attack has been identified as Prabha Arun

A woman who was stabbed in a 'horrific' attack on her way home from work on Saturday night has been identified as Prabha Arun. 

The 41-year-old was discovered by three people passing by the small alleyway near Amos Street in Westmead shortly after 9.30pm, where she was on the phone when the random attack happened.

In a cruel twist, the mother of one was speaking to her husband when she cried out: 'I think I’ve been stabbed' as he listened helplessly over the phone while his wife was brutally attacked  just metres from her home,' The Daily Telegraph reports.

The IT consultant hopped off at Parramatta train station, walked along Argyle Street and then onto Park Parade before taking the footpath next to the golf course where she was attacked just metres from her Westmead home.

9News reports the working mother was expected to fly home to India in June to see her husband and their 10-year-old daughter after being apart for three years. But now, her husband is reportedly on his way from India after the tragic news.

Emergency services were called to the scene after Ms Arun was discovered lying in a large pool of blood by nearby residents and witnesses.

Nearby resident Arvand Amirian told 9News he had found Ms Arun with blood all over her body after hearing 'crying screams' that 'didn't sound normal'.

'There was blood covering her face, her neck, her chest - her chest wasn't even moving so that's when I assumed she was gone,' Amirian said.

Her  friend Sarada Angadimani, who Ms Arun is currently staying with, told 9News: 'Prabha was a really hard working, beautiful person. And, most importantly, a loving mother.'

'I hope God gives the family enough strength to endure this pain.'

She was treated at the scene before being taken to Westmead Hospital, where she later died after suffering a 'life threatening injury'.
