A Milwaukee woman accused of killing a pregnant woman, cutting out her baby and passing off the child as her own dropped her insanity plea during a final hearing today before her trial starts next week.

Annette Morales-Rodriguez, 34, had previously pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect to two counts of first-degree intentional homicide, including homicide of an unborn child.

The mother-of-three is accused of killing 23-year-old Maritza Ramirez-Cruz last October and slicing out the fetus to pass off the child as her own. The boy, who would have been Ramirez-Cruzâ€™s fourth child, also died.

Plea dropped: Annette Morales-Rodriguez, 34, is accused of killing a pregnant woman and cutting out her baby in October last year. She dropped her insanity plea on Thursday before her trial starts on Monday

Victim: Maritza Ramirez-Cruz, 23, was expecting her fourth child when she was murdered last October. Her baby boy, who she planned to call Omar, also died

An earlier defence team planned to pursue an insanity plea, but the court-ordered doctor didn't find evidence to support that argument.

Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge David Borowski said Thursday that the opinion of someone hired by the previous defence attorneys would not stand up in court.

Morales-Rodriguez changed her plea to not guilty during the hearing Thursday. She answered Borowski's questions about whether she approved and understood the change, through an interpreter, with 'Correct,' 'I remember,' or 'I understand.'

Morales-Rodriguez is accused of faking a pregnancy because she couldn't get pregnant and her boyfriend wanted a baby boy.

Tragedy: Maritza Ramirez-Cruz had three children and was expecting her fourth when she was savagely murdered after offered a ride

She allegedly panicked as her 
supposed due date grew near and scoured the suburban Milwaukee 
neighbourhood for two weeks looking for a pregnant woman whose child she
 could steal and call her own.

On October 6 2011, she saw Maritza Ramirez-Cruz - a total stranger - and offered her a ride.

When
 she got in the car, however, Morales-Rodriguez said she needed to go 
back to her home to change her shoes, and Ramirez-Cruz followed her in 
to use the bathroom.

It
 was when she came out of the toilet that Morales-Rodriguez allegedly attacked her
 with a baseball bat, striking her in the head several times.

With
 Ramirez-Cruz on the ground, her attacker choked her until she
 passed out, and cut her open using an X-Acto knife, attempting a Cesaerean section that she 
had seen done on the Discovery Channel, according to the complaint.

Ramirez-Cruz died of loss of blood and asphyxiation. The boy died as a result of the mother's death, the complaint said.

Morales-Rodriguez then hid Ramirez-Cruz's body in her basement.

Later that evening, emergency services responded to a 
call from Morales-Rodriguez, who said that she had 
just given birth to a child who was not breathing, according to the 
criminal complaint.

Paramedics were unable to revive the boy and he was pronounced dead at the scene.

Morales-Rodriguez was taken to the hospital but, 
after an autopsy of the full-term baby - and medical examinations of the
 woman herself, it was determined that she was not pregnant and had not recently given birth.

The next day, police returned to Morales-Rodriguez's home and found Ramirez-Cruz's mutilated body.

Prosecutor Mark Williams said he plans to play a videotaped confession by Morales-Rodriguez during the trial, which is expected to start with jury selection Monday and last a week.

Similar cases of women taking an unborn child from a mother's womb were reported in Massachusetts and Oregon in 2009, in Pennsylvania in 2007, in Illinois in 2006 and Missouri in 2004.

In the Oregon case, a woman obsessed with having a baby pleaded guilty last year to the murder of a pregnant woman whose unborn child was cut from her abdomen after she was bludgeoned to death.

Korena Roberts, 29, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

In Massachusetts, a Worcester woman, Julie Corey, pleaded not guilty to killing her pregnant friend, Darlene Hayes, and cutting the baby from Hayes' womb.

Corey and the baby were found in a homeless shelter in Plymouth, N.H., in July 2009, just days after Hayes was found dead with a fractured skull.
