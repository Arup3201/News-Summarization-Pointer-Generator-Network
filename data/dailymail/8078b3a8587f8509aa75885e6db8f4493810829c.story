The only Muslim member of the English Defence League has been fined by magistrates after becoming embroiled in an argument with Asian men.

Abdul Rafiq admitted using threatening language to cause harassment, alarm or distress at the demonstration in Bradford, West Yorkshire, on October 12.

The 43-year-old from Glasgow described himself as an 'outcast' after recieving the fine at Leeds Magistrates' Court today, claiming 'the Muslim community does not like me for my EDL membership'.

Abdul Rafiq was arrested by police at the demonstration in Bradford on October 12 after becoming involved in an argument with Asian men

The court heard how Rafiq claimed to have been threatened by 10 Asian men at the rally before launching into a tirade of swearing.

Prosecuting Mike Vittis said the man tried pulling a union flag from his bag before being ushered away from the scene by police.

Speaking after the case, Rafiq, whose parents moved from Pakistan to Scotland in the 1960s said: 'I got off the train and a group of Muslims started calling me a traitor.

'I told them I love my country and I pulled out the Union Flag.

'A police officer said my actions were inflammatory but I'm a very passionate person and I was just defending my country.'

The 43-year-old from Glasgow claimed the men called him a traitor for being a member of the controversial group

Though Rafiq has never experienced racism at the hands of EDL members, he recognises there may be some prejudice within the organisation.

'I think we should have Muslims and people of all types in our group, maybe we should change the name,' he said.

'I am an active pro-unionist. Ever since I was a kid I loved the Union Jack. I love living in the UK but a lot of people take it for granted.

'All I want to do is make the world a better place and where better to start than your own country.'

He was fined £110 after admitting the 
public order offence, and must also pay a victim surcharge of £20 in 
addition to a contribution to prosecution costs of £85.

Speaking of the court's decision he 
said: 'I am really pleased that I can carry on with my work for the EDL.
I am going to try and recruit more Muslims to the cause.'

'I suppose this shows that the justice system does at least have some common sense.'

Rafiq, who has eight brothers and sisters, claimed he has been shunned by his family for his involvement with the controversial group.

'I cannot go to Muslim areas any more and I get death threats online,' said the man who attended his first EDL event in 2009.

Rafiq described how members at the demonstration in Manchester Piccadilly patted him on the back as though he were a 'hero'.

'The EDL members were chanting things like "Muslim bombers off our streets" but nobody gave me any trouble.

'Then there was this guy who was 
selling union flags. I went up to him and asked for one and he didn’t 
stop me so I bought one from him.

The 43-year-old was happy with the court's decision and is eager to recruit more Muslims 'to the cause' of the English Defence League

The English Defence League (pictured here at a demonstration in 2009) have been described as Islamophobic by critics

'Within a few moments I had people all
around me patting me on the back. They saw me as a breakthrough, I was 
like a hero and it was all over the Internet within a few hours.'

'The EDL always tell me to bring more Muslims along. I have never found them to be racist.

'They say to me "if there was more Muslims like you there wouldn’t be a problem"'

'In Scotland I always carry a union flag around with me and people come up to me and say ‘why are you carrying an English flag?

'I tell them that it is not an English flag - it is a British flag.'

Rafiq decided to join the league, which has been described by critics as Islamophobic, in the wake of terrorist attacks in the UK.

'After the 7/7 bombings, Glasgow airport and the death of soldier Lee Rigby - it all made me feel sick.

'It gave all Muslims a bad name and I thought there was a need for people like me to speak out against bad Muslims.'
