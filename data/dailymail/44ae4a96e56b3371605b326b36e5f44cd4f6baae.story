Miami Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill insists he is over the spat with head coach Joe Philbin and is fully focussed on Sunday’s game against the Oakland Raiders at Wembley.

Tannehill was unhappy with a lack of support from Philbin, who hinted that the quarterback may be benched after Miami were beaten 34-15 by the Kansas City Chiefs last Sunday.

But the 26-year-old is now looking ahead to this weekend’s game in London against the Raiders, where he will retain his place as the starting quarterback.

‘It’s done,’ Tannehill said after practice on Friday. ‘It’s something we faced during the week, and it’s done. Now we’re just getting ready to play. I’m excited to be here in London.’

‘We talked, and we’re good,’ the quarterback added. ‘We’re on the same page and, like I said, we’re getting ready for this game.

Miami practiced at Saracens’ Allianz Park on Friday having spent the early part of their week preparing back home.

The Dolphins will feature in their second International Series game at Wembley having played in the inaugural contest against the New York Giants in 2007 - a game they lost 13-10.

After beating the New England Patriots in their opening game of the season, Miami have lost their previous two contests against the Buffalo Bills and Kansas City Chiefs and will be looking to bounce back at Wembley against a winless Raiders team.

Defensive end Cameron Wake backed Tannehill to lead Miami to victory at Wembley this weekend after touching down in England.

He said: ‘We know who our guy is - Ryan is our guy. He will be starting this weekend and we are 100 per cent behind him.’

Wake added: ‘It will definitely be exciting. These are two teams desperately looking for a win. Before we came here (to England) we got a good preparation in and I’m excited by this new opportunity.’
