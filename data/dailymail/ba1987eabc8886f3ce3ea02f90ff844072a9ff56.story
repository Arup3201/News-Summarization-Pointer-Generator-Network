Gesser, who served three years' probation for stock fraud from 1999 to 2002, allegedly denies Alysson's account and will dispute the claims in court on February 24.

Cooperman pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in a Manhattan Magistrate's Court last year for smashing a car window after refusing to pay the fare.

According to reports she shouted" 'You don't know who I am!'

Cooperman insists the alleged incident with Gesser was innocent.

She said she was staying with Gesser and his bride at their Beverly Hills home as a guest. 

She told Page Six: 'We were just sitting and talking. I may have put on [Alysson’s] T-shirt by mistake. They started arguing. I went to my room. The next thing I know the police are there.'

The 43-year-old was Gesser's date at Nobu 57 in 2012 to meet Jonah Hill, star of Wolf of Wall Street, to advise him on the culture of their world, Page Six's Richard Johnson reported.

Alysson, who appeared in a 2009 mobster movie called Middle Men, told Johnson she is 'afraid' of Gesser and has kept her ring.
