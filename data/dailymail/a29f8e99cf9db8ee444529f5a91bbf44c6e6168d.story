A photographer has captured these unusual images of  cats that appear to bear a more than passing resemblance to the stars of cult 1984 comedy-horror film 'Gremlins'.

With their huge, bat-like ears, wedge shaped heads and large eyes, the family of sphynx cats look positively demonic as they squabble in some of the images - and strangely angelic in other pictures.

Banbury-based IT consultant Anatoli Krassavine, 40, travelled to Plymouth to take the eye-popping pictures for his cat breeder friend.

He managed to capture images of the family of felines transform into little monsters when mother Cleo tried to discipline her naughty kittens.

In the images Cleo is shown having to protect her laid-back daughter Pinky from her mischievous brother Trouble, who was was picking on his sister.

As these pictures show, the brief fight looks positively hellish as Cleo snarls and shows her sharp teeth to her son.

Sphynx cats are known for being outgoing and sociable and love being the centre of attention 

'Gremlins' is a 1984 cult comedy-horror film about a young man who receives a strange creature as a pet which then spawns other creatures who transform into small, destructive, evil monsters.

But as other photos prove, the devilish-looking cats can turn into perfect little angels in the blink of an eye once all is forgiven.

Like any mother fed up of her children fighting, Cleo had clearly had enough of her offspring's highjinks

Following the brief spat, Cleo appeared mollified and all seemed to be forgiven as they kissed and made up

Sphynx cats are not actually hairless, although they look it. They are covered in a coat of down, have large prominent eyes and very large  ears - much like the stars of the cult eighties film.

Mr Krassavine, who jointly owns PhotoCat.co.uk, specialises in creative cat photography with a difference - taking unusual pictures of cats in action, doing things human friends might do, or even making the sort of facial expressions humans might make.
