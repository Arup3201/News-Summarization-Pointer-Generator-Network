Standoff: Edward Scott Russ, 46, allegedly planned to rob a pharmacy on Friday morning

A gunman has surrendered after allegedly attempting to rob a North Carolina CVS in the early hours of Friday and taking three employees hostage.

Edward Scott Russ, 46, from Gastonia, was taken into custody just after 7am on Friday following an hours-long standoff with authorities at the pharmacy in Belmont.

He had allegedly entered the store armed with an assault rifle just after 1am but before he could express his demands, a customer saw what was unfolding and went outside and called police.

When police arrived on the scene 
minutes later, they ordered him to drop his weapon but he opened fire 
instead from around 15-20 feet away, narrowly missing them, WCNC reported.

Police
Chief Charles Franklin explained that his men then returned fire but 
did not hit the gunman, and the officers left the store when they 
learned he was holding hostages.

He
proceeded to hold three employees - one female and two males - in the pharmacy. He eventually released two of them and then the final victim, a male, was released around 4am. None was 
harmed in the incident.

According to court records, Russ told one of the hostages to tell police that if they didn't leave the area then a hostage would be killed, the Charlotte Observer reported.

But the two responding officers called for backup and handled the situation 'exactly as they had been trained,' Franklin said.

A 
negotiator was brought on scene to communicate over the phone with the 
gunman, who was believed to be suicidal. Authorities also monitored him 
using surveillance cameras inside the store.

They allegedly witnessed him taking a number of pills from the pharmacy area of the store.

The suspect eventually laid the rifle on a counter and walked out of the door with his hands up, Franklin said. He added that Russ 'stated he was sorry'.

At least 10 agencies had responded to the scene, including a SWAT team.

Russ
is being held at the Gaston County Jail on a $5 million bond on three 
counts of first-degree kidnapping, two counts of assault on an officer 
with a firearm, two counts of attempted murder, and one count each of 
robbery with a dangerous weapon, and communicating threats.

His first court appearance will be on Monday.

Belmont is about 15 miles west of Charlotte.
