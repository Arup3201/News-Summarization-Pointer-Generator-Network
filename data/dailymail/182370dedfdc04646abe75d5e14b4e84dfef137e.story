A woman has swapped playing combat computer games for fighting for real after shedding 19 stone.

Amy Graham, 48, from Salt Lake City, Utah, weighed 470lb (33st) at her heaviest and because she was a dress size 32, she could only find men's clothes to fit her.

Speaking of her weight gain, Amy told MailOnline: 'I have always been a big girl. I was a fat child, I was a fat teenager, I was a fat twentysomething.

'There is a huge misconception about the amount of food someone eats at that size. It's surprisingly a much smaller amount than a normal-sized person. It's more about poor choices really. Eating something filled with fat and sugar instead of eating whole, natural foods. 

'I was an avid online gamer and that contributed to my sedentary lifestyle. I played various games for many years. 

'I stopped weighing myself at 450lbs because I couldn't find a scale big enough to weigh me over that. I know that I probably got up to around 470lbs at one point, and that scared me.

'I knew I never wanted to hit 500lbs in my lifetime. My dress size was probably a 32 at that point. I wore mostly men's clothes at that time because they were easier to find.'

When she turned 40, Amy realised she had to do something to change her lifestyle as her size meant she was suffering from a number of health problems.

She and her husband, Greg, had tried for a baby but she believes her weight meant she was never able to conceive. 

She said of her health at the time: 'I developed sleep apnoea to the point I could not be regulated. 

'I have PCOS (polycycstic ovaries syndrome), I had type 2 diabetes, I started to develop edema in my lower legs. 

'I carried all my weight in my middle region and because of that I was also getting lower back pain. 

'Once I hit 40, I knew things were only going to get worse for me.' 

Amy decided to have gastric bypass surgery but to qualify, she would first have to lose weight.

She explains: 'I saw my doctor who told me I would have to get down to 387lb (27st) so he would actually do my surgery. He needed room to work inside my abdomen, so I had to drop weight to even qualify for surgery. 

'I crash dieted to get the weight off to the point he was ok moving forward. It took me two months.'

Amy was than able to have the gastric bypass - and the operation was life-saving.

'Turns out having gastric bypass actually saved my life in ways I had no idea,' she said. 'When the doctor went in they found out that my liver was three times the size it should have been. 

'My surgery took more than nine hours instead of the two it normally takes, because they had to work around my enlarged liver. 

'My doctor came to me in recovery and told me that I needed to realise this surgery saved my life.

'If I hadn't had it when I did, I would have been dead in two years because I would have needed a liver transplant and I would have never qualified to even be considered to be put on the list, much less be in any situation to get a new liver. 

'I could never have lost the weight by diet and exercise to have saved my life in time. That is a sobering thought. 

'So no matter what I crave, what I want to eat or drink now, I will always remember that my life would have been much shorter than even I expected had I not chosen this path.'

Following the surgery, Amy lost 100lbs (7st) in the first 100 days and continued to lose weight over the following years so she now weighs 204lbs (14st) and is a dress size 12-14.

Her lifestyle is now completely different to how it used to be and she had discovered a love of exercise after becoming involved in an unusual sport - medieval combat fighting.   

'I went from being an online Valkyrie to a real live Valkyrie and I much prefer sword fighting for real,' Amy said. 

Amy now competes for the USA in medieval combat fighting

The hard work paid off as Amy won a gold medal at the Medieval World Championship - who allowed women from around the globe to compete for the first time last year

She now competes for the USA in international competitions where she fights in full battle armour with swords and axes.

The sport is billed as 'Game of Thrones meets Ultimate Fighting Championship' as the weapons are real and the fighters don't hold back.

Explaining why she was attracted to the sport, Amy explains: 'When I first saw a fight, something awoke inside of me and I knew I had to do this. 

'But I got told that because I was a girl, I was not allowed. But I was told in January 2012 that the USA team was going to start a league and that they would eventually allow women once we had enough interest. 

'I kept hoping and supporting the team and on May 31, 2013 it was announced that for the first time women were going to be allowed to fight.'

Amy started training so she could represent her country in the Medieval World Championship in Castillio de Belmonte, Spain, after they allowed women to take part for the first time in 2014.

She said: 'I train five to six nights a week for more than two hours a night. My body craves that. I run, I lift weights, I swim, I sword fight. I am a medieval martial artist who loves what her body has become.'

Amy said she's delighted to have gone from being an 'online Valkyrie to a real live Valkyrie' 

The combat fighter is proud of what she has achieved after losing weight and taking up the tough sport

The training paid off and Amy and team USA came home from the Medieval World Championship with gold medals.

Now Amy is keen to carry on her training and keep winning battles. 

She said of taking part in the contact sport: 'What's it like to compete in the tournaments? It is quite possibly the most adrenaline filled, satisfying, challenging yet amazing thing in the world for me. It is my bliss.

'I am proud to be a female fighter. But I am also proud to be treated with the respect and comradely just like any male fighter is.

'I no longer look for excuses to NOT work out. I have a much harder time fitting everything into my world with my training schedule but I wouldn't trade my life for anything. 

'I love how my body works. I love being 48-years-old and fighting women and men half my age.'

Amy wants to share her journey in a documentary, Iron Maidens, which is seeking funding

Amy has shared her story of medieval combat fighting with British TV company Total Wallop who are trying to secure funding to create a full documentary called 'Iron Maidens' focusing on the female fighters who compete in the brutal sport.

Producer and director Matt Ralph said the sport is full of inspirational women like Amy whose stories they want to share with the world. He has set up a crowdfunding campaign with Indiegogo to raise funds to make his documentary. 

He said: 'For Amy, competing in the Medieval World Championship it marked the moment she had achieved her ultimate goal after losing weight. Full contact fighting had given her a purpose to get mentally and physically fit. 

'I need funding to finish this documentary to show the world the jaw-dropping phenomena of medieval fighting is not just a realm for men, but that women are as tough, brutal, and as competitive as their male counterparts.'
