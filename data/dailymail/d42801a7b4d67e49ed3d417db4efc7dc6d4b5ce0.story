A dog trapped underground for four days in a drainage tunnel was rescued when its owner hired a digger to get her out.

Lulu the Jack Russell disappeared down the unused pipe last Friday at Boveney Lock in Dorney, Buckinghamshire, when owner Gina Kaiser took her for a walk.

But after darting into the 60cm-wide pipe under a car park she got stuck when she was unable to turn around because of rubble narrowing the tube.

Ms Kaiser called the RSPCA but was told if she could hear Lulu barking the likelihood was she would find a way out of the disused pipe.

They advised her to wait it out but as the days passed she became more and more anxious.

Lulu, aged five, barked non-stop for 
four days and kept herself alive by drinking the trickle of water 
collected at the bottom of the pipe.

Firefighters said there was a risk of the situation becoming hazardous so they stepped in to help with the rescue

Getting desperate, Ms Kaiser decided to hire her own JCB to cut the dog free.

However, a passerby alerted the local fire service and they stepped in and launched a six-hour operation to rescue Lulu.

A five-strong team used the digger, cutting equipment, spades and shovels to excavate a wide hole to get to the pipe which was more than eight feet underground.

They then smashed their way into the drain and lifted Lulu free.

Social worker Ms Kaiser said: 'The fire service have been brilliant, it shows there are some really good people about.'

Fire brigade station manager Doug 
Gruchy said: 'Lulu's owner had organised her own search, but the 
situation was in danger of becoming hazardous.

'We
 took the decision to carry out this rescue because of our concern for 
the safety of her search party as well as for Lulu's welfare.

'We are obviously delighted that it has had a happy ending.'

He
 added: 'It's quite understandable that an owner, when faced with a 
situation like this, will want to go to extraordinary lengths to save a 
pet.

'But our advice to pet owners is to contact the RSPCA in the event of an incident of this type. They will then liaise with us if specialist rescue skills and equipment become necessary.'

Firefighters have now closed off the entrances to the pipe and an adjacent one to prevent a repeat of the drama. 

They eventually managed to get to the tunnel underneath about four feet of earth

A rescuer had to get right into the tunnel to pull Lulu free. She had survived by lapping up water that trickled underneath her

Here she comes: Looking remarkably clean and calm, Lulu emerges from the pipe after a successful rescue

Still licking her lips, an excitable Lulu bears the the muddy paw marks that suggest she scraped away at the pipe walls but to no avail. Thank goodness for mummy and that digger!

It all becomes a bit much for Ms Kaiser as the four days' emotion finally takes it toll and she holds Lulu tight

Not letting her out of her sight, Ms Kaiser keeps a firm grip on her beloved pet after a tearful reunion and remarkable rescue. Home James!
