Two young men found dead in a pond near an Army barracks died from drowning, police have revealed.

The bodies are believed to be those of missing 17-year-old Hugo Wenn and Daniel Lloyd, understood to have been in his 20s.

The pair were discovered almost 10 hours apart in Reed Pond, near Howe Barracks in Canterbury, Kent, on Monday.

A 54-year-old man arrested on suspicion of their murders has now been released without charge, Kent Police said.

A second man has since been arrested by detectives in connection with the inquiry.

The 28-year-old, from Canterbury, Kent, 
was held at 9.30pm yesterday on suspicion of supplying controlled drugs,
 a spokesman for Kent Police said.

He said: 'Police investigating the unexplained deaths of two men in a pond in Canterbury have confirmed that the post-mortem examinations carried out on the men during the past 24 hours reveal that they both died from drowning.

'Officers are awaiting further toxicology results. The families of both men have been notified of the outcome of the post-mortem examinations.'

Hugo had been missing since Friday. He was a former pupil of the city's Archbishop's School.

Daniel Lloyd, understood to have been in his 20s, is thought to be one of the two found dead in a pond

Busking: Tributes have been paid to guitarist Daniel Lloyd, who was seen regularly playing songs in Canterbury

Hugo, who was 6ft 3in tall and said to be a busker and close friend of the other dead man, lived in the pretty village of Barham with his parents Margaret and Robert.

He has a brother, Felix, who is a student at Cardiff University and a former pupil at Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys in the city. His Facebook page was inundated with messages of support.

On Sunday another brother, Oscar, had posted on Hugo's Facebook wall: 'Hugo, mum and dad want to know where you are. Xx.'

Friends of Hugo mounted an online campaign to find him when he went missing, but the pages have now been closed.

A Facebook tribute site called RIP Hugo Wenn has been set up and has been flooded with tributes.

Emma-Jane Green wrote: 'RIP Hugo, you've touched so many people with your incredible beatboxing. Such a talent, all my wishes go to your family and hope you rest in peace. Sleep well dude! xx.'

Meanwhile, Kim Wyatt said: 'Cant believe it just wont sink in that happy young lad wont be cycling around the village anymore saying hi with his big cheesy grin R.I.P Hugo deepest thoughts for your family xx.'

Fondly remembered: Flowers are left at the entrance to the scene around Reed Pond

Another friend added: 'Dear Hugo, Can't believe this has happened. We all love and miss you buddy. Can't believe how many people loved you.

'We all knew how much you loved Beatbox as you busked with everyone in the band at some point, be it Tom playing the guitar or Jamie beatboxing, and sometimes even the whole band.'

Hugo was a former pupil at the Archbishop's School in Canterbury, and left last year after completing his GCSE exams.

Its headteacher Michael Liddicoat described Hugo as a 'gentle giant' who enjoyed more practical subjects including music, drama and sport.

He said: 'We are a very small school and there is a sense of complete shock at this loss. Hugo enjoyed many different subjects, including music, sport and drama.

Forensic examination: The investigation into the grisly discoveries is ongoing

'In doing those subjects, he had many friends across the school. We will be holding a school assembly tomorrow to remember him and to say prayers.

'In many ways, Hugo was a gentle giant who was about 6ft 3in so you couldn't miss him around school. He was fantastic with the younger students and he will be missed.'

Friends of Hugo said he was due to meet friends at the Blind Dog pub just two miles away from Reed Pond, but failed to show up on Friday evening.

The website appeal stated: ‘He was supposed to be meeting some friends at the The Blind Dog pub in Canterbury that night.

Crime scene: The first body was found in Reed Pond at midday. Police divers discovered the second body at 9.40pm

Rough ground: The terrain is so rugged the Army had to be called in to ferry equipment for the police during the search of the lake

Investigation: Police forensic officers enter the scene around Reed Pond

‘He sent a text message saying he was there, but then another message saying he was leaving and this was at 8pm.

‘This was all before any of his friends (from Simon Langton Grammar School) had got to the pub, so none of them saw him there.

‘He was then seen walking along Canterbury High Street alone beat boxing to himself, at 8.30pm.

‘He has been missing since then and has not made any contact with his family/very close school friends.’

Sorely missed: Tributes have been flooding in to a Facebook tribute page set up for Hugo

Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward to help with the investigation.

Chief Inspector Steve Barlow, the District Commander for Canterbury, said: 'We are appealing for anyone who may have been in the immediate vicinity of Reed Pond in Canterbury between 5pm on Friday 27 January and 11am on Monday 30 January to get in contact with us if they saw anything unusual or if they have any information which they think could help this investigation.'

Reed Pond is on Ministry of Defence land behind Howe Barracks but MoD officials ruled out any connection between the deaths and the armed forces.

An Army spokesman said: 'It is extremely sad news that two bodies have been discovered on the training area behind Howe Barracks in Canterbury.

'This piece of land is owned by Defence Estates and, while occasionally used by the Army, is open to the public.

'It is not thought that the deaths were in any way connected with HM armed forces.

'A number of soldiers were involved in helping with the ground search prior to the discovery of the bodies but the matter is now entirely in the hands of the police.

'Our thoughts are with the friends and families of the deceased.'

Anyone with information should call the incident room on 01303 289600.
