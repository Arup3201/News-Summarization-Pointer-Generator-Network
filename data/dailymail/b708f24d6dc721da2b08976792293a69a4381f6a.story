Controversy: James Hazell's comments have caused an uproar and forced the BBC to apologise

The BBC has apologised after a radio presenter compared breastfeeding in public to him having sex with his wife in  a restaurant.

James Hazell made his comments while hosting a debate about whether women should nurse their babies in public when a guest described it as ‘the most natural thing in the world’.

He said: ‘Next time you are out having a meal at a restaurant, on the basis that it [breastfeeding] is the most natural thing in the world, I will come in there with my wife and then make love right in front of you.

‘Breastfeeding is the most natural thing in the world, and that is fine, but there are a lot of natural things we don’t do in public.’

Laura Cardwell, a mother of two from  Ipswich, was interviewed for the BBC Radio Suffolk show which aired this week.

She said: ‘I listened to the programme later, only to find what should have been a positive affirmation for breastfeeding mothers was turned into crass and ignorant nonsense. related]

‘I was appalled. There is nothing more natural than nursing your baby.’

'Everyone is entitled to their 
opinion, but surely the point of being a radio host is to broadcast 
issues and listen to listeners' feedback, not to push the host's views 
on to us.'

Mum-of-two Nicola Hayes, 25, from Manchester, added: 'It's a baby's human right to eat and a mother's duty to attend that need.'

Mr Hazell has come under fire from breastfeeding campaigners for his comments.[

A spokesman for the Breastfeeding Network said: 'Babies get hungry  and need to be fed.

'Breastfeeding
is an entirely normal way to feed a baby and we're sure that Mr Hazell 
wouldn't want to hear a baby screaming out in public for want of a 
meal.'

Lisa Cole from the website Lactivist said: It's sad that Mr Hazell believes what he does. We are mammals after all.

''He
seems to think it's OK to risk your baby's health with artificial 
alternatives hat will never been as good for babies as breast milk is.'

A BBC spokesman said: ‘We apologise if James Hazell’s comments caused offence.

‘The comment was intended to stimulate a debate and give listeners an opportunity to discuss the issue openly.’

The controversy came as research by Brunel and York Universities showed that fathers do not like their partners to nurse in public as they fear other men may watch.

Recently, a mother was banned from  feeding her child in Oldham civic centre in case it offended Muslims.
