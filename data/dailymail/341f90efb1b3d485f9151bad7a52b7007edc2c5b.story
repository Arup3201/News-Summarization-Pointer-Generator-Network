A Washington man convicted in the brutal slaying of his ex-girlfriend after she broke up with him was given the maximum prison sentence of 33 years.

Jarod Lane, 21, learned Friday as he stood in Kings County Superior Court, in Seattle, that he will remain in prison until he is 54-years-old for violently killing Jessica Scholl, 17, two years ago. Family and friends of hers were on hand for the sentencing.

There were so many supporters, in fact, that extra seating had to be brought in to accommodate them, according to KOMO.

Fueled by jealousy, Mr Lane stabbed the young girl to death and then set her house on fire. His rage saw him first try to strangle and beat her to death.

‘He tried to strangle her with a belt, hit her head against the dresser multiple times, then he drug her to the bathroom where he tried to drown her in the toilet,’ King County deputy prosecutor Jennifer Worley said.

‘When that didn't work, he bashed her head against the toilet tank,’ she added.

Officials said he stabbed the girl so hard with knives he found in the kitchen that he broke multiple blades.

After torching the house, the murderer fled to Oklahoma and was arrested only days later.

He pleaded guilty last month to first-degree-murder and first-degree arson, according to KOMO.

Explaining that he never planned the murder, Mr Lane even tried apologizing to her family in court.

‘I can't express how apologetic and deeply sorry I am for my selfish acts on that unthinkable, unimaginable, and unforgettable day,’ said the cold-blooded killer.

The apology didn’t fly with the dead girl’s family.

Asking for the maximum sentence, mother Stephanie Scholl said that ‘he took the life of my 17-year-old daughter, who was just beginning to live her life.’

The judge swiftly handed down the maximum 33 ½ year sentence, adding that ‘Even though a sentence doesn't bring her back, I really hope that it brings resolution and ultimately some peace for each of you.’

The convicted killer’s lawyer has said more than once that Mr Lane has tried to commit suicide in prison on multiple occasions.
