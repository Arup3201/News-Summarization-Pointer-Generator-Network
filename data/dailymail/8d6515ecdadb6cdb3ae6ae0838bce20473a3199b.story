A five-week-old red fox is resting its weary head on a very bright bandage as it recovers from a broken leg.

The little cub was found abandoned and injured outside a shop in Leatherhead town centre in Surrey earlier today.

With no mother fox in sight, the struggling cub was discovered by a kind passer-by who called a nearby wildlife aid centre.

The little cub, weighing just 1.5lbs, was taken to the Wildlife Aid Foundation in Leatherhead, where its injuries were tended to.

A bright green emergency bandage was applied to its leg while the cub waited for an orthopaedic surgeon to operate, and it quickly decided to use it as a pillow.

Staff at the centre said they believe the cub may have been dropped by his mother while she was carrying him, and that the fall caused the injury.

Founder of Wildlife Aid, Simon Cowell, said: ‘The young cub was found with a broken leg outside the front of a shop door.

‘It is likely the cub's mother may have dropped him while carrying him around in her mouth.

‘Although, it is also possible his mother may have been hit by a car and killed, leaving the cub abandoned.

‘It is very rare for an animal of that age to suffer a broken leg because their young bones are still quite soft.’
