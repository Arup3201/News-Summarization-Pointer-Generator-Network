A millionaire landlord has been banned from renting property after threatening to shoot his tenants over repair bills.

Mark Fortune, who drives a Ferrari F430, failed to make the list of 'fit and proper' landlords.

Edinburgh City Council refused the application because he was fined £650 for threatening to shoot lodgers in  2010 over a £160 repair bill.

Current lodgers will be allowed to see out the end of their contracts rent-free but there are fears that Fortune, who intends to appeal the decision, will escape through a 'legal loophole'.

Threatened tenant Jaime Finn, 28, who stayed in the Lonsdale Terrace flat, said: 'He threatened everybody in the flat. He said, 'I will kick the f*** out of you,' and was boasting about having friends who had been locked up for shooting someone.

'As he left, he kicked the door in and went downstairs in a fit of rage.

'After that, we began to receive threatening phone calls.'

Councillors were told Fortune had been convicted of offences directly relating his business of letting properties.

These included an incident in March 2011 where he was fined £1,000 for operating an unlicensed House in Multiple Occupation (HMO) and September 2011 where he was fined £650 for threatening tenants.

They also heard Fortune's appeal to the Sheriff for a previous refusal of an HMO licence from the Council had been rejected in January.

Now he is removed from the landlord register it is a criminal offence for him to let properties with breaches leading to a maximum fine of £50,000.

Jon Black, secretary of Edinburgh Private Tenants Action Group, which was founded by some of Fortune's ex-tenants, said: 'We are really pleased.

'But registering the properties under a different name could easily be a loophole here. Action still needs to be taken to tighten the system up.'

In 2010 Fortune was also exposed as a blue-badge parking cheat after he left his £118,00 Ferrari F430 in a disabled bay outside the Crown Office in Edinburgh.

He claimed the badge belonged to someone else who used his car.

Fortune disputed the claims of tenant Mr Finn and insisted he had never been convicted of any offence against him.

He added Mr Finn was in arrears on his rent and an eviction order against him in 2010 had been granted.

He added: 'Having been on the landlord register since May 2006, the committee's decision was disappointing.

'Solicitors have been instructed to appeal the decision and I fully expect the appeal to succeed.'
