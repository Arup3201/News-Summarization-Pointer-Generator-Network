Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud dealt with the news he will be out for the rest of 2014 by watching his side qualify for a 17th consecutive Champions League group stage on TV with his left foot elevated on a pile of blankets.

The France international striker underwent surgery on Wednesday after picking up an injury later revealed to be a small fracture near his ankle in the dying minutes of Saturday’s 2-2 draw with Everton.

After Arsenal beat Besiktas 1-0 courtesy a goal from makeshift striker Alexis Sanchez, Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger revealed he could be without his number one marksman until as late as January.

‘He had surgery today and it went well but he will be out for competitive action at top level until end of December, beginning of January,' Wenger revealed after the match.

The absence of Giroud, who picked up the freak injury when the ball smashed into the sole of his boot forcing his foot towards his shin, leaves Wenger with a short supply of recognised strikers. But the manager says the set-back won't force him into a panic purchase.

‘I don’t know yet [on signing another striker] but we try to look around and we want quality. We have that with Walcott coming back soon - we have Podolski, Sanogo and Campbell too.

‘You can't always buy if you have a problem. If you have an injury after September 1, you have to live with it.

‘I bought Sanchez to be a striker. Walcott can be very good. Sanogo and Podolski can play there. Ask Campbell what he is, he will say a striker. They are players of quality and we will see.’

It was indeed Giroud's understudy Sanchez who delivered the vital goal for Wenger on the stroke of half-time but it would have been tough viewing for Giroud as the Gunners battled to hold on.

Giroud’s wife, Jen, posted a picture of her husband with his injured leg elevated as he watched Wednesday's game on TV.

Giroud was rushed into surgery after seeing a specialist on Wednesday. 

The injury may have an impact on Wenger's movement in the transfer market both coming in and out of the club.

Lukas Podolski was thought to be heading to Juventus but a loan move is now in doubt, while Wenger may need to strengthen the frontline further.

Yaya Sanogo was in good form in pre-season, scoring four goals against Benfica in the Emirates Cup, but Wenger refuses to panic just yet and is still looking ahead to the Beskitas clash.
