She's long been a fan of all things equestrian and today, the Duchess of Cornwall turned out for her first day at the races this year.

Resplendent in a tweed coat dress, Camilla, 67, completed her cosy ensemble with a large furry hat and a pair of on-trend over-the-knee boots.

The Duchess was at Sandown Park in Esher, Surrey for the Royal Artillery Gold Cup, an event that celebrates the bravery and dedication of the British Armed Forces with a day of horse racing.

It is one of only two military race meetings in the UK and has been on the racing calendar for more than 150 years.

In front of a grandstand crammed with soldiers, Camilla was introduced to Royal Artillery officers before joining them in the Parade Ring to watch the runners be led past.

Back in the Royal Box, she and the soldiers were treated to a parade of fox hounds from the Royal Artillery Hunt ahead of the opening race, the Jockeys' Handicap Hurdle which was won by Right Step.

Later, the Duchess presented the Royal Artillery Gold Cup to jockey Jody Sole in the Winner's Enclosure before being introduced to a group of retired Royal Artillery officers.

Not even the pouring rain could dampen Camilla's spirits as she kept the drops at bay with an umbrella

Camilla has long been a racing aficionado and is a regular sight at race meetings during the summer

The first Royal Artillery Gold Cup event was held in 1862 in Eltham, before moving to Sandown Park in 1878.

A horse owned by the Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, called Norman Conqueror won the race there in 1996.

The race is restricted to horses that are owned or have been leased by those who are serving, or have served, in the Royal Artillery. 

The jockeys must be amateurs and they must also be past or present members of any of the Armed Services.

In recent years the meeting has established an important charitable theme, with sponsors and race-goers generously supporting Help for Heroes and Royal Artillery charities.

The trip to the races comes at the end of a busy week for Camilla, who yesterday stopped to pose for a selfie with a 13-year-old boy during a tour of an arthritis centre in London.

Danny Roberts, from Maida Vale, is currently being treated for the illness but was delighted when he received a bedside visit from Camilla.

Speaking afterwards, the teenager said the Duchess had been 'really concerned' and added that it was 'very nice of her' to come and visit.

During the visit, the Duchess was shown immune cells in a microscope, which were there as part of a project working out how puberty and stress can affect the immune system.

The Duchess of Cornwall also visited  a school and met pupils taking part in a creative writing workshop

The visit came on the same day as a trip to a school, where Camilla told a class of children that they were being 'very brave' as they read a scene from Shakespeare's As You Like It in front of her.

The Duchess, who was on elegant form in a tailored black jacket and a flared grey skirt, was visiting Holland Park School in West London to present a creative writing prize to one of the children.

Mukahang Limbu, who received a certificate from the Duchess, had taken part in a competition run by charity First Story, of which Camilla is patron.

The charity aims to inspire more children to write by sending authors into schools, among them Scottish writer Kate Clanchy, who was at the school when the Duchess arrived.

Touring the school, Camilla was shown into several classes, including Latin, History, English and one of the science labs.
