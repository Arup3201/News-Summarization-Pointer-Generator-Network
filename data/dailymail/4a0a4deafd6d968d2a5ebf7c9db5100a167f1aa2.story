A photo of a child strapped to his napping mat at a Texas daycare has sparked a state investigation into the school's practices.

The image of an unidentified child at Heart2Heart Montessori Academy in Willow Park showed the boy secured to the mat with two strips of duct tape over his blanket, with one at the feet and the other over his shoulders.

The picture was taken by a now-former employee of the school.

This image of a child strapped down at his daycare has sparked an investigation by Texas child services officials

Parent Lorrie Almquist said the image led to a confrontation with academy co-owner Pam Decker on Wednesday.

Decker then admitted to her that she'd resorted to similar tactics with Almquist's son, 3, on the same day the picture was taken.

'I was honestly in such shock, I had no words to say to her,' Almquist told KHOU. 'I was immediately angry. Upset.'

She immediately removed her son from the school.

'She was very apologetic, and told me it was something that probably shouldn't have been done,' she said.

Concerned parents are already taking their children out of the Heart2Heart school after a former employee captured the disturbing image

An e-mail from academy director Ashlea Pena attempted to quash panic among parents.

'Mrs. Decker is devastated by a very foolish decision she made,' she wrote before adding that the child in the image was 'in no way harmed or caused any distress.'

Child Protective Services is investigating a complaint of prohibitive punishment naming the school.

The academy self-reported the incident.

An April CPS inspection found no deficiencies at the academy.

A Thursday night meeting to discuss the situation drew several worried parents.

'Obviously, I'm concerned,' said one mom, 'but the meeting went well.'

The school immediately self-reported the incident and is cooperating with state investigators

She said despite the image she would let her child stay enrolled.

The owner, who has not been named. is allegedly no longer allowed in the school.

'The school has an exemplary performance history, and will work with childcare licensing authorities,' the academy said in a prepared statement.
