Americans are eating more butter than they have in decades after a fear of trans fats and clean-food trends put the spread back on the menu.

As a result, butter consumption is now at a 40-year-high with U.S. citizens eating 5.6lbs a year of the yellow stuff.

This is an increase by 25 per cent in the last decade, after hitting a low of 4.1lbs per person in 1997.

Utterly butterly: U.S. citizens now consume 5.6lbs of butter per person and year, according to the American Butter Institute - the highest level in 40 years

In comparison, sales of margarine have dropped as consumers try to avoid trans fats, found in processed foods or products where the qualities of natural fats have been mimicked.

Trans fats increase cholesterol levels in the blood which can lead to heart attacks, strokes and heart disease.

As the health hazards that follow high consumption of trans-fats have become common knowledge, demand for natural dairy products has increased.

‘Consumers are changing their perception of food and looking for healthier alternatives.

'They’re moving away from highly processed foods and artificial ingredients,’ Anuja Miner, executive director of the American Butter Institute, told the LA Times.

Butter, being high in vitamins, 
beneficial saturated fats, and ‘good cholesterol’ that is vital for 
brain and nervous system development, is increasingly becoming the first
 choice for cooking and sandwiches.

‘Everything tastes better with butter,’ David Riemersma, president of the American Butter Institute and head of Butterball Farms in Grand Rapids, Michigan told the paper.

‘Consumers also want real, natural wholesome products. They want to understand all the things on an ingredient list. Butter fits perfectly. It's either just cream or cream and salt.’

Recent guidelines from the Food and Drug Administration, have all but banned trans fats, and many U.S. companies, such as Unilever, has followed suit and removed it from their products.

Meanwhile academics in Britain are comparing sugar to cigarettes, saying consumption levels must be reduced by 30 per cent to save public health.

‘Sugar is the new tobacco,’ said Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool. ‘Everywhere, sugary drinks and junk foods are now pressed on unsuspecting parents and children by a cynical  industry focused on profit not health.

Reducing added sugar to products by 20-30 per cent would be enough to halt or even reverse rising levels of obesity and associated ill-health, US-UK campaign group – Action on Sugar claimed.
