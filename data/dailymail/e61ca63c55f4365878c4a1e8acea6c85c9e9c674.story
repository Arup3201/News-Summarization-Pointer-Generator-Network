This is the shocking moment a tombstoner hurled himself off a historic Brunel bridge - plunging more than 60ft into the water below.

The young man was caught on camera leaping from Royal Albert Bridge, which was built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel and spans the River Tamar between Plymouth and Saltash, Cornwall.

Donning black swimming shorts, he scaled scaffolding surrounding the crossing, before jumping the height of two houses into the cold water.

The tombstoner is just one of many youngsters who locals claim are 'risking their lives' by throwing themselves off the famous bridge.

Shocking: This is the moment a tombstoner hurled himself off the Brunel-built Royal Albert Bridge in Saltash, Cornwall - plunging more than 60ft into the water below

Aaron Dinham, who photographed the man's daring leap, said: 'Whenever the weather is nice, and the tide is high, there can be up to 15 kids jumping from the pier and pontoon. Now they have found a way of getting onto the scaffolding that is surrounding the pillar of the Brunel railway bridge.

'They are using it as a diving board for their tombstoning. The height they are jumping from is crazy, and I guess it's only a matter of time before someone gets hurt.'

It comes as emergency services, MPs and 
city councillors have issued warnings to young people about tombstoning over the summer months.

The craze involves jumping from cliffs, piers and other structures, before entering the water below in an upright position 'like a tombstone'.

Yesterday, Alison Seabeck, Plymouth Moor View MP and former lifeguard, urged parents the region to help clampdown on tombstoning.

She said young people are seen jumping from rocks and structures on Plymouth Hoe - often into shallow water - every year, and some have even been left paralysed by tombstoning.

She added that tombstoners are not only risking their own safety but the lives of others as their exploits draw emergency services from other areas.

'We need to put an end to this tombstoning practice in Plymouth,' said Ms Seabeck. 'It's simply not safe. All we can do really is keep raising awareness of the problem.

'If you are a parent or a carer I would encourage you to talk to your sons and daughters and remind them of how dangerous tombstoning is.

'There are some beautiful areas of Plymouth's shoreline to visit and enjoy, you don't have to risk your life.'

Ms Seabeck said she believes tombstoners do not know how dangerous their actions are, saying: 'It always staggers me that intelligent young people will throw themselves off a wall on the Hoe into the water.

'They often do not know exactly how deep it is and, with the changing tides, they do not know how dangerous their actions are. We have had very serious accidents where people have been left crippled or paralysed and yet year after year it happens again.

'As a former lifeguard I can tell you there is seriously nothing more terrifying than seeing jumping into the water and not immediately reappearing.'

Royal Albert Bridge, which was opened by Prince Albert on May 2, 1859, comprises two 455-feet iron trusses, situated 100 feet above the water, giving it a total length of 2,187 feet.

Its creator, Isambard Kingdom Burnel, was an English mechanical and civil engineer whose designs revolutionised public transport and modern engineering.

A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police, today described tombstoning, which is not illegal, as a 'potentially lethal pursuit'.

'The summer holidays and warmer weather can attract tombstoners into Plymouth,' he said. 'Tombstoning is a reckless activity and even in calmer waters it can be extremely dangerous.

'We, along with the Coastguard, are trying to deter young people from this potentially lethal pursuit and we strongly advise against it.

'It may seem like fun but people are gambling with their lives against the power of the sea by jumping into unknown waters.

'It is unfortunately the case that if they carry on they are likely to end up with serious, life-changing injury or even death. This risk-taking behaviour is just not worth it.'

A spokesman for Brixham Coastguard said the issue of tombstoning is a recurring problem for Plymouth.

'Over the last few weeks we have had reports of tombstoning in Plymouth and we do look into each case,' she said.

'When these reports come in we inform the coastguard patrol boat, or the police patrol boat in the area, to have a word in the ear of tombstoners offering safety advice. It's a problem we have every year. It's something the kids will do but they are advised not to because of the dangers.

'There have been cases over the years of kids getting seriously hurt. This is something of course that we want to avoid.

Tombstoning has been linked with numerous deaths in Britain in recent years.
