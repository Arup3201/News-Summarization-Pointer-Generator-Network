Still the sweetheart: Dame Vera will be central to the festivities

Dame Vera Lynn is to play a central role in a long weekend of spectacular celebrations to mark the 70th anniversary of VE Day.

The wartime singer – who will be 98 on Friday – is to be included in events to commemorate seven decades since the end of the Second World War in Europe on May 8.

Ministers will today announce a three-day spectacular, including wartime-themed parties, the lighting of a chain of beacons, a veterans’ parade, an RAF fly-past and a 1940s-themed celebrity pop concert.

Government sources said they were ‘pulling out all the stops’ for the commemorations – which start the day after the Election – because it is likely to be the last major anniversary to fall during the lifetime of Second World War participants.

Although now too frail to travel to the events, Dame Vera – the Forces’ Sweetheart – will be consulted over the arrangements and is likely to provide either a written tribute statement or video message.

Under the plans, a service of remembrance will be held at The Cenotaph on VE Day itself, including a two-minute silence at 3pm marking the moment Winston Churchill announced the end of the war. Schools will hold VE Day-themed assemblies or tea parties, and during the evening a chain of over 100 flaming beacons will be lit across the UK.

On Saturday May 9, cathedrals will ring their bells in celebration and a 1940s-themed concert will be held at London’s Horse Guards Parade.

The concert, to be broadcast live on BBC1, is expected to feature many of the stars who appeared in a similar 60th anniversary VE Day concert, such as the singers Katie Melua and Katherine Jenkins.

May 10 will be marked by a service of thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey, followed by a veterans’ parade which will pass along Whitehall and under the HM Treasury balcony where Churchill appeared before VE Day crowds.

A reception for 2,000 veterans will be hosted by the Royal British Legion in St James’s Park, coinciding with a fly-past by a Hurricane, Spitfire and Lancaster.

Dame Vera boosted the troops’ morale by performing songs including We’ll Meet Again and The White Cliffs of Dover at concerts in Egypt, India and Burma. Last night, she said: ‘I am sorry I will not be able to celebrate the 70th anniversary of VE Day in London in person, but my thoughts are with all who take part. We must always remember those who fought and all those who gave their lives on our behalf.’

A Downing Street source said: ‘Everyone wants Dame Vera to be involved if possible.’
