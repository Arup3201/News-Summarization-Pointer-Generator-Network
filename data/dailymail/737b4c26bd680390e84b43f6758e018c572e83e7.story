Nonito Donaire picked up his fourth world title by beating Simpiwe Vetyeka via technical decision on a night of controversy in Macau.

The Philippine suffered a cut in the first round thanks to an accident headbutt and wasn't able to see properly.

That saw referee Luis Pabon stop the bout before the fifth - causing uproar and handing Donaire the WBA featherweight title against the champion Vetyeka.

Coming out swinging: The fight was stopped going into the fifth after Vetyeka's (right) first round headbutt

'After the first round there was a headbutt. The ref asked me if I want him to stop the fight. I told him I want to continue,' Donaire said.

'I wasn’t able to see his right hands, which were his power shots. I didn't want the fight to be stopped because I want to continue for the fans.'

Vetyeka - who was assured of a rematch - said: 'I didn’t think it was a headbutt. I’m terribly upset.'

Trouble: Donaire's gash from the headbutt got progressively worse and he struggled to see punches coming
