Former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond, 61, was seen out in London for the first time in months last night at a charity fundraiser at the Savoy Hotel

Former Barclays boss Bob Diamond was seen out in London for the first time in months last night, nearly a year after he resigned over the rate-fixing scandal.

The 61-year-old banker, who pocketed £2m severance pay plus a pension when he quit the bank in disgrace last July, attended a fund-raising dinner at the Savoy Hotel.

Dressed in black tie, he joined B-list celebrities including Tania Bryer, Patsy Palmer and Neil Fox on the red carpet at the Global Party, a fundraiser for disadvantaged young Londoners.

Diamond has barely been seen since he stood down as Barclays chief executive after the bank was found guilty of manipulating the interbank lending rate, Libor.

The American-born CEO, once described as 'the unacceptable face of banking' by then business secretary Peter Mandelson, initially refused to stand down when the scandal was uncovered.

Barclays was fined a record £290m a year ago for attempting to manipulate Libor between 2005 and 2009.

But days later, on July 3 last year, he resigned, after Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King apparently lost trust in him.

Despite persistent rumours of Diamond's plans to start up a new banking venture, he has hardly been seen since.

Diamond, who is married with three children, is said to have quit Britain following the scandal, and was spotted in New York last month riding the subway.

He owns a vast house with pool in London's Kensington, a £24m penthouse in New York, and also has homes in Colorado and Nantucket.

In an interview last year he admitted didn't like to dwell on how he had to quit the bank he had worked for for 16 years, saying: 'It's hard for me to talk about it - I've tried to move on.'

Diamond resigned last July in the wake of the Libor scandal, and has barely been seen in the UK since
