Squatters have moved into one of London's oldest pubs in London previously frequented by Agatha Christie, Dylan Thomas and Bob Marley - and plan to make it popular again by serving Sunday lunches.

The 300-year-old Cross Keys pub in Chelsea was boarded up by its owner Andrew Bourne earlier this year after it stopped making a profit.

Mr Bourne planned to turn the building into a £10million residential complex with a swimming pool but was refused planning permission.

But 17 squatters have taken over the building and are exempt from a new law giving the police the power to arrest them for squatting in a residential property as the pub remains commercial.

The group, all aged between 17 and 36, insist they plan to turn the property into an art gallery and public library while also serving up Sunday lunch.

Portuguese theatre student Mariana Costa, 28, said: 'This is a commercial property which is boarded up and empty so we can squat here. We have welcomed many members of the community in and everyone seems quite happy about us being here.

'I work and I'm a student. I have rented before in London recently but found that in order to survive I have to work many hours a week in order to pay the rent and my grades began to slip as I was working when I should have been studying.'

In a note attached to the outside of the building, which has been boarded up since the summer, the squatters wrote: 'Hello neighbours, we are your friendly local squatters.

'I can assure you that we are quiet and respectful and we would love to seamlessly become a part of your community. We are keeping your pub safe and tidy until it is going to be used again.'

A spokesman for the Chelsea Society, which has been campaigning to save some of the area's historic pubs, told the London Informer: 'There really is delicious irony in this as Andrew Bourne failed to turn it into a residence, but now against his will it has indeed turned into one for squatters.

'The squatters really couldn't be nicer and say they won't allow anyone in who is a nuisance. They are very courteous and polite and have offered us a Sunday roast and say they want to turn the space into an art gallery.'

But Mr Bourne said it was 'outrageous' that the squatters could move into the pub.

He told the Evening Standard: 'The notice they have put on the door is rubbish and the police have been called out by neighbours some three times already. It has brought crime to the area.

'They are professional squatters who know exactly what they are doing. They will be gone in a week or so, I think they will probably walk out after November 5.'
