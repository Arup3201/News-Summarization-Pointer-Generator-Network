The 
teenager who moved out of her parents' home and then sued them for child
 support after they ordered her to stop seeing her boyfriend appeared in court Wednesday after an incident on Sunday that prompted the couple to seek mutual restraining orders against each other.

Rachel Canning,18, from Lincoln Park, New Jersey, accused boyfriend Lucas Kitzmiller of choking her during a fight early Sunday morning.

Canning claims Kitzmiller assaulted her in the street before she jumped in her car and drove to a nearby police station to report the alleged assault.

Troubled: Rachel Canning, pictured in court in March, has been granted a temporary restraining order against her boyfriend - the same man her parents had been trying to get her to stop seeing

In court 
Wednesday, Kitzmiller asked to have the hearing postponed because his 
attorney, Steven Caputo, is out of town, NJ.com reports.

Canning told the court she was 'ready to proceed' as she appeared without an attorney, but accompanied by her parents.

Morristown
 Superior Court Judge James DeMarzo agreed to postpone the hearing until
 August 6, when Caputo is expected to return to New Jersey.

In
 addition to postponing the hearing, DeMarzo advised both parties to 
'not publicize the case,' and to 'keep your business to yourself.'

The judge specifically told the couple it would be ill-advised to discuss the case on social media outlets.

'This
 is a private matter,' Sean Canning, Rachel Canning's father, told the 
publication. 'We’re confident the court will handle it appropriately. We
 want to let everything die down and go back to our private lives.'

'Attack': Lucas Kitzmiller, left, allegedly choked Canning in the street in the early hours of Sunday

Party: Canning, pictured right with friends ahead of prom, graduated high school and starts college in the fall

She claimed her parents threw 
her out when she turned 18. But they claimed she voluntarily left their 
Lincoln Park home because she didn't want to abide by their 
household rules.

She moved in with attorney John Inglesino, and in February 
his family filed the suit on her behalf.

Though Canning went to court hoping to shame her parents into paying her child support, she was the one who took the brunt of criticism - both from her parent's lawyers and the judge himself.

'Have you ever in your experience seen such gross disrespect for a parent? I don’t see it in my house,' Family Division Judge Peter Bogaard said at a hearing.

Distraught: Her parents Elizabeth and Sean Canning, pictured in court in March, eventually reconciled with their daughter and she moved back into their New Jersey home but continued to see her boyfriend

She eventually reconciled with the parents in March, withdrew the lawsuit and moved back in to their home, where they reported that family life was peaceful.

Her parents told USA Today that they decided not to interfere with their daughter's love life anymore.

Canning graduated from Morris Catholic High School this spring and will be attending Western New England University as a biomedical engineering major in the fall on a $56,000 scholarship.
