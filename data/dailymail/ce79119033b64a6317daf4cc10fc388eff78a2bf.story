Realising at the last minute your favourite dress is dirty, or you don’t have a clean shirt for an important meeting could soon be a thing of the past.

The Swash is a washing machine and iron in one that refreshes clothes, removes odours and flattens out wrinkles at the press of a button - and does so all in the time it takes to have a shower.

Pods of liquid are sprayed directly onto the clothes, before a drier circulates air through the device, and a dirty item is ready to wear in just 10 minutes.

The Swash (pictured) is a washing machine and iron in one that refreshes clothes, removes odours and flattens out wrinkles at the press of a button - and does so all in the time it takes to have a shower. Pods of liquid are sprayed directly onto the clothes, before a drier circulates air through the device

The $499 (£292) Swash was designed by Whirlpool and P&G and is 54-inches (1.3 metres) tall and 17-inches (43cm) wide.

The Swash system uses weights to hold clothes in place, while liquid is sprayed across the clothes, on the front and back.

The
 ‘thermal drying function’ heats and circulates air through the clothes,
 and when this air hits the liquid in the fibres, it steams out the 
creases.

Swash doesn’t need water, and also doesn’t need to be plumbed in, making it portable.

It can be used on denim, wool, polyester, Lycra, cotton, cashmere, sequins, beading and lace.

Whirlpool and P&G claim the pods can also restore fibres and restore their shape over time.

The clothes hanger sits inside the machine, which is 30-inches (76cm) long when closed and 55-inches (1.39 metres) long when extended.

The companies claim this makes Swash ideal for a bedroom or closet - especially if people no longer need an ironing board.

Lights on the top of the Swash count down cycle lengths and will alert users when their clothes are ready to use.

‘We have talked to thousands of people over the years that have told us they are yearning for a better way to care for clothing in between laundering and dry cleaning,' said Charles Pierce, group president of P&G New Business Creation.

'Swash gets clothes ready to wear quickly, effectively, easily and without requiring extensive resources.'

Swash is only available to pre-order from Bloomingdale’s in the U.S., and will be fitted in select Delta Sky Club Lounges for passengers to use later this year.

It is expected to go on sale across the U.S from September, but an international release date and price hasn't been announced.
