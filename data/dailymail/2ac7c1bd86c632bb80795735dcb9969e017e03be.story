Steve Bruce has made an offer to free agent defender Joleon Lescott and held talks with Tom Ince over a possible move to Hull City.

Former Blackpool winger Ince, 22, has turned down the chance to move to Inter Milan and is talking to clubs in England with Stoke City also keen.

Although Ince is a free agent, Blackpool believe the £1.5m loan fee Crystal Palace paid for him in January means they can demand £8m in training compensation at a tribunal.

In demand: Joleon Lescott is wanted by West Ham, Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, Portland Timbers and Al Ain

That would have a huge bearing on whether Hull proceed.

Bruce has already opened talks with Tottenham over an £8m deal for Michael Dawson and Jake Livermore and has offered Lescott a two year deal with option for a third.

West Ham, Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, Portland Timbers and Al Ain have also made approaches to the 31-year-old defender.

Money matters: Blackpool could demand £8m in training compensation for Tom Ince in a tribunal
