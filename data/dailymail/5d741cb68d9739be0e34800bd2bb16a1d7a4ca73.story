Dozens of rowdy Besiktas fans marched through Liverpool city centre on Thursday afternoon, setting off flares and chanting while the police kept a close eye on them.

The Turkish side are in town for their Europa League round of 32 clash with Liverpool at Anfield, but some of the visiting supporters couldn't wait until the 7.45pm kick-off to start showing their support.

Crowds of the Besiktas supporters were spotted throughout the city, often accompanied by police, who assured local press they had the situation under control.

The fans were chanting and setting of flares, but were not reported to have caused any damage or trouble

Speaking to the Liverpool Echo, a police spokesman said: 'We are aware that there are a group of fans in that area who are a bit noisy and a bit lively but they're not running amok.

'We have got officers on duty in the city centre and at the ground. They are aware of it and they are dealing with it.'

While it is something of a rarity in England, Turkish football fans are certainly no stranger to the use of pyrotechnics either inside or outside of stadiums.

The scenes on Merseyside follow a string of embarrassing incidents involving travelling fans in European cities this week.

In Paris, Chelsea fans were caught on film singing racist songs while, in Rome, Feyenoord supporters clashed with police on both Wednesday and Thursday, leading to more than 30 arrests.
