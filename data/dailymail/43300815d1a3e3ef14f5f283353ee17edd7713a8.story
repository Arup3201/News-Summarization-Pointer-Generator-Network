A pregnant mother gave birth to twins on the hard shoulder of an Interstate after going into labour in a speeding car - then brought one to life with CPR when she realised it was not breathing.

Lynette Hales and a friend were driving along I-80 from Utah to Nevada when her waters abruptly broke three months prematurely, about 25 miles outside of Wendover.

Stranded in the middle of the desert, with not enough time to make it as far as the nearest hospital, Lynette was forced to stop by the side of the road, about a hundred miles outside of Salt
Lake City, and call 911.

JJ and AJ: Doctors in Utah say, while they need 
constant supervision given their vulnerable condition and premature 
birth, both JJ, left, and AJ, right, are doing well

Heart stopping: She even had to resuscitate one of the babies by the side of the road when his little heart stopped beating (pictured is JJ)

Under the instruction of the emergency operator, she and her friend delivered the babies by the side of the road as lorries and cars sped past.

Incredibly, when she saw that one of the boys was not breathing, Lynette then performed CPR on his little body to bring him round.

Finally an ambulance arrived to take the family to hospital where she named them J. J. and A. J.

Doctors
in Utah say, while they need constant supervision given their 
vulnerable condition and premature birth, both babies are doing well.

Lynetteis by no means the first mother to heroically give birth under extreme conditions.

Last year, Abby
Wellington, 34, from Fort Lee, New Jersey, told how she gave birth in 
the midst of Hurricane Sandy, with no electricity or running water.

Rescue: After the babies were born, they were finally taken to hospital by air ambulance

She went into labour at 10pm as the category one storm battered the East Coast, and with no medical equipment to hand, her husband, Stephen Olefson, said he was forced to improvise by candlelight, digging out 'gloves and a potato chip clip to clamp the umbilical cord'.

'No light, no heat, literally by candlelight,' he said. 'We used the same candles we used for my mother-in-law's 70th birthday party.'

To make his wife comfortable, Mr Olefson used hot water left in the pipes to make a shallow bath and created a soft covering on the tiled bathroom floor using towels and pillows, and lined up some candles in front of the toilet.

Surprise delivery: Susan Carnes holds baby Ebosalume after her mother Katherine Oyedoh gave birth to him unexpectedly at 36,000 feet

'I felt totally fine the second 
the baby came out,' she recalled. 'Before that, I was in another world.'

Also last year, first-time mother Katherine Oyedoh gave birth 36,000 feet in the
air on a Delta flight between Atlanta and Senegal.

Stewardess Susan Carnes, from Tampa,
Florida, delivered the baby to cheers from passengers.

She said:  'I saw her and just the way she was 
leaned over and moaning, I just knew. I said, do you feel like your water has 
broken and she said "Yes", and that's when I knew, okay we're having a 
baby.'
