Daniel Sturridge was forced to apologise to Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers and the Anfield crowd after marring a match-winning performance with a show of petulance.

Liverpool’s England striker destroyed Everton with two first-half goals but spurned the chance of a hat-trick by blazing a 54th-minute penalty over the bar. When he was substituted soon after, he appeared to speak out of turn to Rodgers, who promptly brought him into line with a stern rebuke that stopped him in his tracks.

‘I want to apologise for my reaction,’ he told BT Sport. ‘It was just disappointment after missing the penalty, but I let myself down and the fans. I apologise if it caused anyone any offence.

Frustration: Daniel Sturridge argues with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers after being substituted

Having words: Sturridge and Rodgers exchanged views after the striker was brought off in the second half and the England striker appeared to shake off Rodgers' attempt at a handshake (right) as he walked to the bench

Glare: The argument was clear to see but both Sturridge and Rodgers insisted that there is no problem

Pose: Sturridge put a picture of his man of the match award on Twitter saying: 'Guess I'm not good at pens!'

‘I didn't react in any way (to 
Rodgers) when I came off, I was just disappointed in how I took the 
penalty. But it's not about myself. It's about the boys in the team.’

After
 revealing Sturridge had said sorry to his team-mates in the dressing 
room, Rodgers made it clear he had given his in-form frontrunner a 
reminder of how he expects Liverpool players to conduct themselves.

‘It
 wasn’t a difficult decision to take him off at all,’ he said. ‘He 
scored with two sublime finishes and was outstanding throughout. But I 
wanted to shore the game up, after we put so much effort in. It was time
 to make a change and balance the team up, and that’s why Daniel came 
off.

‘It was just 
frustration on his part, but there is no problem. He apologised to the 
group. I always say to the players that they must show respect to the 
club and that when the manager makes a decision like this, it’s not 
because someone has played poorly.

‘Sometimes
 it is tactical or down to injury, but you accept coming off and sit 
with the rest for the remainder of the game. If you want an explanation,
 you can knock on my door the next morning, and you will get an honest 
answer. You don’t disrespect the club or its supporters. Daniel was just
 disappointed because he was desperate to get on the scoresheet again.’

Steven
 Gerrard took responsibility for Sturridge’s penalty howler after 
handing spot-kick duties to him in the hope he would complete his 
hat-trick.

‘I told him to 
take the penalty, so I have to hold my hands up and take the blame for 
that,’ said the Liverpool skipper. ‘I wanted him to experience what it 
feels like to score a hat-trick against Everton at Anfield. I’ve 
experienced it, and I wanted him to. It's a shame he missed it but he'll
 just have to go and score against West Brom now.

My responsibility: Steven Gerrard insisted it was his decision for Sturridge to take the penalty

‘But
 we've got two world-class forwards, in Daniel and Luis Suarez, and with
 them we have always got a chance. The aim all season has always been 
top four and we are very much in that now.

‘Daniel
 was disappointed but he was absolutely world class and he destroyed 
Everton in the first half. The third goal killed Everton and knocked the
 stuffing out of them.’

Rodgers added that he hoped to make ‘a major signing’ before the window closes at the end of the week.

Everton’s
 injury worries worsened after Romelu Lukaku was taken off on a 
stretcher with suspected ankle ligament damage in the first half.

‘It
 looks like a ligament injury,’ said manager Roberto Martinez. ‘We will 
assess it in the morning, but it doesn’t look good. He twisted his ankle
 after colliding with Gareth Barry when Liverpool scored the first goal,
 and it has been put in a cast.’

Martinez pulled no punches as he reflected on his side’s shortcomings.

‘I
 was particularly disappointed with the first half,’ he said. ‘There was
 a spell of 13 or 14 minutes where we lost the game through naivety. We 
were desperate to come here and be ourselves and give a performance that
 the fans could be extremely proud of, but we played a bit too much with
 our hearts at times. Liverpool wanted to hit us on the counter, and we 
should have used that to our advantage, but we didn’t.

‘We
 seemed focused only on trying to score, and, as a consequence, we left 
ourselves way too open. We haven’t done that all season, and it became a
 test of character in the second half after we let the game slip away 
from us. We looked out of sorts, and we gave the ball away far too 
cheaply.’

Rodgers insisted 
Liverpool are on course for a return to the Champions’ League and denied
 he was dissatisfied with club bosses over their failure to deliver more
 signings this month.

‘I'm 
delighted for the players and the supporters, because it was a brilliant
 team performance based on really good defensive organisation, he said. 
‘We were clinical in front of goal and outstanding on the counter 
attack.

‘I think it was a 
message. We have shown all season we are going to be in contention for a
 Champions' League place, and this was further proof.

‘We have shown great spirit. We have structured the team so we are not reliant on any one player.

‘To
 get Sturridge and Suarez into the same team is a bit of a risk because 
other players have to fill in. Jordan Henderson, for instance, had to 
work his socks off, but I would rather take that risk because they give 
us so much of a threat.

‘I 
think all wins are important, but especially against your rivals. 
Psychologically, it was a big win and one that can reinforce the 
confidence in the squad.

‘It
 puts us four points ahead of Everton now and we have to put the foot to
 the floor and go on from this. We had a real focus and concentration 
coming into the game. We knew it was massive, and to score four goals 
and defend like we did was an immense performance.

‘If
 anyone questioned whether Steven can play that deeper role, they got 
their answer. You have seen him in 32 derby games where he has been all 
action, but he was equally brilliant further back tonight.

‘He
 is such an unselfish guy and a real generous man. A local guy in the 
derby giving up a penalty like that is a mark of the man.

‘It
 is really special because of the nature of the game with two teams 
doing the city proud all season. I am more delighted for the supporters 
and the players. The fans can go away and have a beer and celebrate.

‘Hopefully
 we can have a major signing before the window shuts, I think we will 
hopefully do something over the next couple of days.

‘It
 couldn't be further from the truth that I am angry with the club. I 
came here to do a collective effort to turn around the fortunes of the 
club. The people here are very important to what we are doing and we 
want to do it together.’
