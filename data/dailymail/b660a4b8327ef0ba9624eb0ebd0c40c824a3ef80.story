A new scheme will see 100,000 houses built on so-called 'brownfield' land and reserved for sale only to young people buying their first homes

First-time buyers under the age of 40 will be offered 20 per cent discounts on 100,000 new homes under a new scheme starting next month.

David Cameron will today announce that the 'Starter Home' initiative will be fast-tracked so potential buyers can register as early as January.

Under the scheme, 100,000 houses will be built on so-called 'brownfield' land and reserved for sale only to young people buying their first homes.

The scheme was first proposed at Tory conference but not expected to begin until after the General Election. It has now been brought forward six months.

It is an extension of the party's flagship Help to Buy scheme, which aims to get people on the housing ladder. The discount for a £200,000 home would be a huge £40,000.

Housebuilders would be exempted from some taxes and property regulations, making it easier to release brownfield sites - land formerly used for industrial or commercial purposes - to build these homes on. The savings would then be passed on to first time buyers.

Mr Cameron said: 'Hardworking young people want to plan for the future and enjoy the security of being able to own their own home. I want to help them do just that.

'Under this scheme, first-time buyers will be offered the chance of a 20per cent discount, unlocking home ownership for a generation.

'This is all part of our long-term economic plan to secure a better future for Britain, making sure we are backing those who work hard and get on in life.'

A consultation document will be launched today outlining the details of the scheme, which is designed to help more young people who are priced out of the housing market buy their first property.

From next month they will be able to provide their details on a new website, putting them on a list for new homes built under the scheme.

Officials said councils and builders are already looking at sites where the scheme could operate and work on the first tranche of homes will start next year.

Property taxes and requirements imposed by councils mean house builders pay an average of £15,000 extra per home – potentially adding tens of thousands to the cost of each site.

By exempting them in specific cases from such regulations, the money will be freed up to be passed on to new buyers. The homes could then not be re-sold at market value for a fixed period.

More than 30 house builders have indicated their support for the plans as have nine local authorities.

Mr Cameron will also announce a new design panel, including architects Sir Terry Farrell and Sir Quinlan Terry to come up with plans for the properties.

Official said they would be lower cost and high quality attractive homes that 'meet the demands of modern life'.

Stewart Baseley, executive chairman of the Home Builders Federation said: 'Increasing housing supply is a huge and complex challenge and significant barriers remain. Bringing forward more land for house building, while also enabling more first time buyers to realise their ambition of home ownership would be another positive step on the way to tackling the housing shortage.

'The industry is keen to work with government to develop policies that would allow for more high quality homes to be built in the right places.'

Sir Terry Farrell, Founding Partner at Farrells, said: 'This panel has the potential to make a real difference. It builds on the recommendations of the Farrell Review, which highlighted the need for more proactive planning and better placemaking as we attempt to address the housing crisis, with radically higher priority given to landscape, sustainability and the public realm.

'Only by planning and designing our villages, towns and cities together with local communities can we create the kind of built environment we all aspire to and should be demanding.'

First time buyers will be able to combine the 20 per cent discount on the price of the new home with a Help to Buy mortgage, meaning that both the house and the mortgage will be made more affordable.
