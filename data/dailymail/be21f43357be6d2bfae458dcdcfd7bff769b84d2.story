A major clean-up is underway after thousands of people wrecked a beauty spot in a 12-hour illegal rave organised to celebrate Margaret Thatcher's death.

They left behind 45 bags full of rubbish including cans, broken bottles and food wrappers while monuments were tagged with graffiti.

Police said around 2,000 people attended the rave at the picturesque Goyt Valley near Buxton in Derbyshire.

Shocking: A major clean-up is underway after thousands of people wrecked a beauty spot in a 12-hour illegal rave organised to celebrate Margaret Thatcher's death

Wrecked: They left behind 45 bags full of rubbish including cans, broken bottles and food wrappers while monuments were tagged with graffiti

Beauty spot: The area where the rave took place is part of the Peak District National Park

The 'witch is dead' event was organised through social media, with news of the event spreading through text messages. Large numbers of youngsters made their way to the outdoor music event from Buxton railway station.

Police said they left a trail of destruction at the usually scenic spot.

Police monitored the event, which began late on Saturday night and continued until Sunday lunchtime.

But now local council officials have been left with a major clean-up operation.

A national park spokesman said: 'We have so far collected 45 bin bags full of rubbish including cans, bottles and food wrappers.

'There was also graffiti on signs that had to be cleaned.'

Unpleasant: Nitrous Oxide canisters - also known as laughing gas - littered a car park following the rave

Mess: Thousands of ravers decended on the national beauty spot of the Goyt Valley in the Peak District. However, they left a trail of damage and more than 45 bin bags of litter

Saying goodbye: On Wednesday, more than 2,300 people from 170 countries attended the former Conservative prime minister's funeral

A spokesman for the organisers of the
 rave, Gash Collective, said: 'We bagged up four vans worth of litter 
and apologise for any that we missed.

'We have arranged for a team to continue cleaning up this weekend.'

One party-goer wrote on Twitter: 'Thanks buxton for one of the best parties ever !! Sorry about the mess.'

Hundreds of  thousands lined the streets of London to salute Baroness Thatcher as she made her final journey towards St Paul's Cathedral. Many threw white roses in the path of the gun carriage that carried her.

Inside the packed cathedral, David Cameron said the Iron Lady's 'difficult decisions, led to less division, less strife at the end of it'

Lady Thatcher's only granddaughter Amanda also delivered a reading after flying in from America with her brother.

 Chancellor George Osborne was seen sobbing as the service went on, while other high-profile figures were also moved.
