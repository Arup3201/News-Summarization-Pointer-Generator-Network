We've all heard that age-old adage that travel broadens the mind - but does it really?

While today it's common practice to take that gap-year abroad, exploring new places and putting off university for 12 additional months, a survey  found that the majority didn't believe this year off had helped them positively develop as a person.

In fact, more than a third of respondents even admitted that they struggled to make the transition from carefree lifestyle to a nine-to-five work mentality.

Does a year abroad really broaden your horizons? New research of 1,000 UK backpackers says no!

Student shipping specialist, 1StopShip, conducted the research, finding that 60 per cent of those surveyed didn't believe that their time away had been particularly beneficial.

Twenty eight per cent, however, did believe they'd changed for the better - but quickly reverted back to their old attitude when they arrived back on British soil.

To add more salt to the wound, 29 per cent of people questioned confessed to growing sick of their backpacking buddy’s endless stories and 12 per cent stated that their friends returned with a false sense of superiority.

And those who are planning to travel post-university before joining the working world? Well, you may want to reconsider.

Though gap years have become increasingly popular, 60 per cent of those surveyed didn't think it had been all that beneficial to their personal development

Many felt that the travelling and partying made it more difficult to transition into a nine-to-five lifestyle

Thirty four per cent admitted that they struggled with transitioning into a nine-to-five lifestyle.

Fourteen per cent admitted their stint overseas left them dreading work and feeling unprepared and 23 per cent still felt unsettled once they had landed their first job upon return.

It seems as though those concerns are also reflected by employers.

Nineteen per cent said that their current boss viewed their time spent travelling as a negative, while 14 per cent struggled to get a job due to their lack of experience compared to non-travelling counterparts.

But 39 per cent did view their experiences abroad as a positive on their CV.  

Ian Brown, from 1StopShip, commented: 'While the research may seem a little damning when it comes to taking a gap year, we know from our customers – a good proportion of whom are young people, recent school leavers or graduates – that there can be huge benefits too. 

When it came to employers, 19% felt that their current boss viewed their time abroad as a 'negative'

'We would advise anyone looking to genuinely enrich themselves, or make a positive impression on prospective employers to consider incorporating both work and travel, such as teaching or temping overseas; this can ensure you acquire new skills, whilst also experiencing a new culture and seeing new places.'

Emily Moult, a former Leeds Metropolitan University student who spent a year teaching English as a foreign language (TEFL) in France, agrees.

She said: 'I reflect fondly on my year teaching abroad and think of it as a serious life-changing experience. 

'Not only did I get to see new places, but I was also able to improve my language skills and gain a whole host of new skills, all of which helped me enormously when it came to getting a full-time job.'
