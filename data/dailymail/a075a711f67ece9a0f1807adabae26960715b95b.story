A father of three died in front of his daughter when a gun went off during a fight with police in his bedroom, an inquest has heard.

Unarmed officers raided Colin Berry's home in Bradford earlier this month to carry out a search for illegal drugs.

They found him with his daughter in an upstairs bedroom with a gun held behind his back.

A scuffle ensued, during which the weapon was discharged, and Mr Berry was pronounced dead at the scene from a gunshot wound to the head.

The 49-year-old's death came as a shock to neighbours, who knew him as a reformed character and a born-again Christian.

Mr Berry was often seen walking the streets near his home with his dog as leader of the local Neighbourhood Watch, keeping the area free from crime.

Jude Lee, an investigator from the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), told the inquest in Bradford yesterday that police went to Mr Berry's house on April 1 with a search warrant issued under the Misuse of Drug Act.

Officers forced entry into the home, and a number of them went upstairs and entered a bedroom where they found Mr Berry with a firearm.

'His daughter was with him at the time,' Ms Lee said. 'A scuffle seemed to ensue, it's still under investigation, the firearm went off.'

The father of three was officially identified by his wife Jeanette the next day, the inquest was told.

Coroner Paul Marks asked if a second post-mortem examination had been carried out, but he was told neither Mr Berry's family nor the police had requested one.

He then authorised the release of the deceased man's body for burial.

The IPCC launched an investigation after West Yorkshire Police informed it of Mr Berry's death.

Ms Lee told the inquest: 'At present there's no evidence there was any criminality, but it is still under investigation.'

Mr Berry's family did not attend the hearing, which was adjourned pending further inquiries.

Mr Marks said: 'My condolences are with the family for their sad loss.'

It is understood that none of the three members of the Neighbourhood Policing Team who were involved in the raid at Mr Berry's home have been suspended from duties.

At the time of his death, neighbour Susan Myers said: 'Colin was supposed to be the Neighbourhood Watch organiser for this area and he would walk round at night with his Staffy.

'He was a pleasant fellow, but had a bit of a past. About two years ago he became a born-again Christian and was trying to be a better person and do the right thing.'
