Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc has refused to confirm if Angel di Maria is headed for the French capital by claiming that 'nothing is done'.

Real Madrid forward Di Maria is surplus to requirements at the Bernabeu after the acquisitions of Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez and he has been heavily linked with a move to PSG.

But other clubs around Europe remain interested in the Argentina star, with new Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal a keen admirer of the winger.

Van Gaal is keen to pursue a deal for the 26-year-old, who starred for Real during their Champions League triumph last season, if the price is right.

But when asked about Di Maria's potential move to the Parc des Princes, Blanc said: 'I'll leave you to speculate. At the moment nothing is done.

'Are there negotiations? It's not for me to say, but for the board of the club.'

Reports have suggested that Di Maria will move to PSG on an initial season-long loan before completing a £49million transfer next summer in order for the Ligue 1 champions to comply with Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules.

The club were fined this summer for breaching FFP and they have already spent £50m on Brazil defender David Luiz from Chelsea.

PSG president Nasser Al-Khelafi is believed to have travelled to Madrid to open negotiations for the transfer of Di Maria.
