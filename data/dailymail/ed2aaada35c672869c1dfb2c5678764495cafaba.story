Jose Mourinho has left Thibaut Courtois sweating on his place in the Chelsea team ahead of Tuesday’s Champions League clash against Paris St-Germain.

Courtois was left out of the team to face Everton last week in the Barclays Premier League because Mourinho claimed he had physical and mental fatigue.

Cech was exceptional in the 1-0 victory over Everton at Stamford Bridge and is desperate to re-establish himself as the first choice keeper again.

Jose Mourinho refused to admit which of his goalkeepers will get the nod to start on Tuesday night

Mourinho said: ‘Petr and Courtois don’t know who is playing at this moment, so I cannot tell you.

‘I repeat, Chelsea have the two best keepers in the Premier League. I am very happy with both. The team is very confident because they know that behind them they have a good keeper.’ 

Mourinho also confirmed that Diego Costa, who missed three domestic games in England because of his stamp on Emre Can in the Capital One Cup semi-final second leg, starts up front.

The Chelsea manager added: ‘Costa will start tomorrow (Tuesday). I don’t think it is good for a player to be without a game for three matches, so I don’t think he is in the best condition. 

‘At the same time Loic Remy and Didier Drogba played the last three matches and it is important to have minutes and confidence.’
