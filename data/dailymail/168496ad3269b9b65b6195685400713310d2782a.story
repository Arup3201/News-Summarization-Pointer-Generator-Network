Police are hunting a doctor accused of 'killing' an Ecuadorian beauty queen who had no interest in plastic surgery but whose family claims she was pestered into going under the knife.

The family of 19-year-old Catherine Cando, who dreamed of becoming a doctor and was crowned queen of the city of Durán in October, today demanded answers from the medic who they claim pestered her into undergoing liposuction as a prize for winning the contest.

Catherine, who was a healthy weight and never wanted surgery, died during the procedure despite saying in an interview shortly after the contest: 'I don't want to do it. I don't need it.'

'She never had weight problems,' Catherine's brother, Daniel Zavala told MailOnline. 'But this doctor called lots of times. He insisted.'

Today they released heartbreaking pictures of Catherine as a little girl to help warn against the dangers of cosmetic surgery. It comes as police hunt doctor accused of 'pestering' her into undergoing liposuction.

Beauty pageant: The liposuction was a prize for being named Queen of Durán in October

Catherine was said to be at ease with her figure and had no interest in surgical enhancement.

The procedure was not an official prize - a tablet computer and a new car were sponsored by the government - but Dr Gustavo Berh, who served on the beauty pageant's judging panel, offered free liposuction for the winner.

Ecuadorian media reported the doctor wanted to use the image of the Queen of Durán in publicity shots for his medical practice.

'It was a marketing strategy by the surgeon, Gustavo Berh,' a statement released by Durán city government a day after her funeral stated.

The beauty queen initially said she would donate the prize to someone more in need of plastic surgery, but Dr Berh said it was non-transferable.

As well as the phone calls to Catherine, a pre-med university student, Dr Berh invited her to watch several operations and hinted she could become his assistant, according to her mother Betsabe Cornejo. 

He finally convinced her by promising to reduce her waistline from 60cm to 57cm which might help the beauty queen win future contests.

On Saturday morning, Catherine entered a clinic in Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city, for what was supposed to be a two-hour operation. 

According to health officials, she died at about 6pm of cerebral edema - the accumulation of fluid in the brain.

But, when family members tried to find out what went wrong, the could not be reached. 

The Ecuadorian Health Ministry and the Attorney General's office have opened an investigation into the clinic and Dr Behr. 

Gen. Ignacio Benitez, chief of police of the Guayaquil region that includes the city of Duran, said the police are collaborating with the Attorney General's office in the investigation. On Friday, police and agents from the Attorney General's offfice searched a building in Guayaquil looking for the doctor. But he was not there and the investigation continues. 

Ecuadorian media has reported that Dr Behr is officially registered as a general practitioner but not as a plastic surgeon. 

However, Francisco Vera, president of the doctors association of the state of Guayas, which surrounds Guayaquil, said Dr. Behr was indeed a surgeon

Despite her mother's objections, Catherine began an exercise and diet regime and her weight went from 140lbs to 117lbs. She then beat 13 other candidates to win the pageant

'What I want is for this doctor to explain what happened,' said Cornejo, a single mom who raised Catherine and four other children largely on her own in Durán.

She said her daughter aspired to become a doctor in order to help people and despite her good looks, she never showed much interest in beauty contests.

However, while Cornejo was traveling in the U.S. last year, Catherine's aunts persuaded her to enter the Queen of Durán contest. 

Despite her mother's objections, Catherine began an exercise and diet regime and her weight went from 140lbs to 117lbs. She then beat 13 other women to win the pageant.

The beauty queen made the front cover of Expresiones magazine. The doctor finally convinced her to undergo the procedure by promising to reduce her waistline

'She was the only candidate who stood out for both her beauty and her intelligence,' explained her brother, Zavala.

He said Catherine next planned to enter the state-wide Miss Guayas pageant and even dreamed of becoming Miss Ecuador. 

Isaac Torres, who was dating Cando, said  these ambitions plus her growing friendship with Dr Behr finally tilted the scales in favor of liposuction.

The operation was performed on the same day he was due to celebrate his eight-month anniversary with her. 

Torres bought a dozen red roses to surprise Catherine that evening but she never left the hospital.

The surgery was carried out at this clinic by Dr Gustavo Berh, who served on the judging panel at the beauty pageant

Lawyer Carlos Reyes Izquierdo said: 'I was told she had died of a brain edema.

'But the clinic staff told her relatives that she had died of a cardiac arrest.

'I have ordered cytological and pathological examinations to find out what exactly happened.

'There has been no support from doctors who have failed to explain anything about the case.'
