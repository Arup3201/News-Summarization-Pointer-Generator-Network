Stoke City want Tottenham winger Aaron Lennon. The former England winger has fallen down the pecking order at White Hart Lane and they are prepared to sell to help bolster the squad elsewhere.

Manager Mark Hughes has Victor Moses on loan from Chelsea and Oussama Assaidi from Liverpool but Lennon would be seen as another step forward in plans to change Stoke's style and add more pace to their attacking play.

Tottenham want around £7million but Stoke will face competition from QPR among others.

Lennon celebrates scoring his first White Hart Lane goal in a 1-0 win over Bolton in April 2006, the winger's first season at Tottenham. He has since gone on to become the club's longest serving player

Lennon is the north London club's longest serving player having joined from Leeds as a teenager for £1million in 2005.

The 27-year-old quickly became part of Martin Jol's first-team plans and has been a crucial part of the Spurs squad for the majority of his White Hart Lane career.

However, the 2013 arrival of club record signing Erik Lamela for £30million as well as the emergence of academy star Andros Townsend have seen Lennon frozen out the first-team recently, as new Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino intends to rebuild his struggling squad.
