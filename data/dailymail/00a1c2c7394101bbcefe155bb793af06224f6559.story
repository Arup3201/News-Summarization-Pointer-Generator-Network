At least 100 families receiving housing benefit are living in luxury homes on handouts that could fund £1m mortgages, figures have revealed.

More than 30 of those families are being given a staggering £1,500 a week to live 'swanky' lifestyles - more than three times the national average wage.

Of the 100 families, 60 have their rent paid by the state to the value of £5,000 a month, according to the Department for Work and Pensions.

At a time when millions of people are struggling to get on the housing ladder, the handouts would easily cover the monthly payments on a £1m mortgage.

The handouts are allowing families to live in upmarket parts of London such as Kensington, Chelsea and Westminster alongside wealthy neighbours such as Roman Abramovich and George Michael.

The figures have been criticised by campaigners and raised concerns that the Government's plan to cap housing benefit is not being enforced.

Ministers announced last year that housing benefit, which currently costs the taxpayer £22billion every year, should be capped at £400 per week.

However, the latest figures from the DWP show there are close to 5,000 families still claiming more than the £400 cap. Although almost four out of every five people on housing benefit pick up less than £100 each week.

Public opinion has been riled by the cases of immigrants and asylum seekers who have been allowed to live in lavish flats at the expense of taxpayers.

In 2010 it emerged that a family of Somalian asylum seekers were getting £1.2m a year to live in Kensington, West London - a short walk from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's new home in Kensington Palace.

Abdi Nur, 42, an unemployed bus conductor, his wife Sayruq, 40, and their seven children moved to the three-storey home in the fashionable area of the capital after complaining that their previous home had been in a 'poor' part of the city.

In another case last year, a Somalian family moved from a house in Coventry to a £2m property in West Hampstead, north London.

The extravagant lifestyle is one that the majority of hard-working families can only dream of.

The figures will raise calls for the Government's benefit reforms to be bulldozed through the Commons - despite pleading from Liberal Democrats.

The data, made public under the Freedom of Information Act, show the areas of the UK that pay out the most in housing benefit are Birmingham (£469million per year), Glasgow (£337m), Brent (£306m), Westminster (£281m), Hackney (£267m), Newham (£264m), Enfield (£258m), Haringey (£254m), Liverpool (£254m) and Manchester (248m).

Emma Boon of the TaxPayers' Alliance said: 'This is further evidence that it is right to cap benefits. It is unfair to ask taxpayers to pay for swanky central London homes for others when they can't afford to live in those postcodes themselves.

'Many middle or low income families have to decide if they can afford to house their family in town, or if they have to move out to somewhere more affordable. It is not unreasonable to ask those on benefits to make the same choice.'

The DWP says the new rules which have been put in place mean that those families currently getting more than £400-per-week will be gradually taken out of the system and moved into cheaper accommodation.

A spokesman added: 'These figures underline exactly why our Housing Benefit reforms are so necessary'.
