More than 450 witnesses reported seeing four bright meteors -- or fireballs -- along the East Coast Tuesday, the American Meteor Society reports.

The first fireball was reportedly seen over Florida and Georgia at around 1pm Tuesday, AMS reports. 

The other three were reportedly seen within 90 minutes of one another by witnesses from Maryland to Tennessee.

Fireballs: The American Meteor Society reported that three of the four fireballs occurred within 90 minutes of one another

 'It is rare that multiple significant fireball events occur and are reported to the AMS in the same evening,' AMS reports.

AMS officials say that the fireballs were unrelated and after analyzing proximity of witnesses, time and data, it was determined that 'each event was unique.'

The AMS has reported more than 420 witnesses seeing the second fireball, occurring at 9.55pm. 

Witnesses reported seeing the fireball from states including Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Ohio.

AMS officials say they believe the fireballs will not cause harm to the earth and people do not have to worry about the sightings, Business 2 Community reports.

No fireball sightings have been reported since the fourth fireball was seen but AMS officials are urging anyone who saw the fireballs to file an 'official fireball report.'

Twittersphere: The AMS posted a photo of the second fireball tweeted by one of the witnesses on the AMS website 

Witnesses: More than 450 witnesses from Pennsylvania to Florida reported seeing one of the four fireballs
