Alberto Moreno looks set to make his Liverpool debut against Manchester City at the Etihad on Monday night after Brendan Rodgers declared the left-back 'is ready to play straight away'.

The £12million signing from Sevilla has three caps for Spain and was regarded as one of the most exciting young full-backs in Europe last season.

The Reds take the short trip to Manchester looking to cement their position as title contenders by getting a positive result at the home of the reigning Premier League champions.

And Liverpool boss Rodgers has no qualms with throwing his new recruit straight in at the deep end.

Speaking to Liverpool's official website, he said: 'He (Moreno) has got huge potential. He's a really exciting young player. When you watch him, he's very attack-minded, very quick and he serves the ball really well. 

'At 22, he's hungry to succeed. He has got improvements to make but he's one of the players we've brought in this summer who is ready to play straight away.

'We had a practice game here last week and he looked very good. He's one who is coming straight out of La Liga. He's come from the Europa League champions.

'He's done great. Last season he was one of the top left-backs in Europe and was highly sought after. He's a boy that will fit well into our way of working.'
