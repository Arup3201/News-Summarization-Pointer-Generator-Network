Towering over the skyline of the Taiwanese city of Taichung, this superstructure could become one of the most surreal buildings on the entire planet.

Huge 1,000ft high beams of steel stretch into the sky creating a giant triangular frame which will house the world's highest roof garden for visitors to enjoy.

As tall as the Eiffel Tower, the Taiwan Tower is the brain child of Tokyo based architect Sou Fujimoto, who won an international competition to design the building.

The Taiwan Tower: This steel superstructure is to be built in the city of Taichung following a competition that was won by Tokyo based architect Sou Fujimoto

Imposing: The triangular shaped structure will be around 1000ft in height, which is around the same height as Paris's Eiffel Towel

Labyrinth: Hundreds of steel beams stretch into the sky but allow a natural light in to create a semi-outdoor space, while the tower will be surrounded by parks for visitors to use

Landmark: The Mayor of Taichung has said the tower will act like a sun for the city, with the city's districts as planets

Fujimoto claims the building is his 'oasis', which he says is trying to embody the 21st century spirit of the East Asian island.

The tower project is composed of two main parts, that of the steel frame and the roof garden. The design is inspired by the Taiwanese Banyan tree.

A labyrinth of beams is designed to create a semi-outdoor space, while the garden above seemingly floats in the sky.

The garden is said to be a continuation of the vegetation from the country.

The building is also being touted for
its environmental credentials, which Fujimoto says he hopes is a model 
for green architecture of future generations.

It
will use renewable energy systems to power it, while also having 
rainwater harvesting facilities and solar panels to create hot water.

Stunning views: The roof garden, described as a 21st century oasis that floats in the sky, will house vegetation from the nation

Big budget: The building is expected to cost around 6.59bn Taiwanese dollars and is due for completion in 2017

The structure itself will be composed of numerous beams of 800mm in diameter.

A completion date in 2017 has been set for the project, which has a total budget of 6.59bn Taiwanese dollars.

Speaking about the project Taichung Mayor Jason Hu told the Taiwan News website the building will be 'a spot bright enough for the whole world to see.'

At a press conference Mr Hu made reference to the solar system, claiming the Taiwan Tower will be like the sun, with Taichung's many districts acting as planets.

Hu added that the tower will also bring a large amount of revenue to the city.
