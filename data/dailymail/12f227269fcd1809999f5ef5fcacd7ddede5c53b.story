He made headlines around the world after using his last £500 on a huge billboard advert begging employers to give him a job.

And it appears the ploy paid off after 24-year-old Adam Pacitti landed a position with a top media firm.

Delighted with his new employed status, Mr Pacitti has now used his first pay packet to fund another huge billboard in Shoreditch, London, reading: 'I spent my first wage packet on this billboard. Thank you for helping me.'

Giving something back: Adam Pacitti has spent his first paycheck putting a thank you note on a billboard a month after using the advertising stands to beg for a job

Mr Pacitti came up with the idea of the billboard advert after months and months of searching for work.

The billboard in Shoreditch, London, featured a picture of Mr Pacitti with the message: 'I spent my last £500 on this billboard, please give me a job.'

The billboard included the address of a specially created website, where potential employers could watch a video CV and find out more about Mr Pacitti, from Ryde, Isle of Wight.

The site was swamped by more than 1.5 million hits from around the globe and Mr Pacitti found himself at the centre of a social media storm.

He said: 'The original tweet I sent out, telling people what I was doing with a photo of me and the billboard had 1,600 retweets and endorsements from people like Jeremy Vine, Al Murray and Frank Skinner.

'I had thousands of e-mails and an unbelievable amount of interest.'

Mr Pacitti admitted he has been overwhelmed by the response to the Employ Adam campaign.

He said: 'Of course I was hoping it would go viral, but I ended up receiving coverage from newspapers across the country and websites around the world.

'I couldn't be more grateful for the response I've had and I'm just so grateful to all the people who shared my website. Without them, I'd still be looking for work.'

Almost immediately after launching the website employadam.com, the job offers started to roll in.

'I actually had people offering me jobs 
before the billboard went up. They liked the video CV and the website, 
but I knew the billboard would be the real selling point.

'A potential employer e-mailed me within an hour of the website going live.'

Instead of sorting through rejection letters, Mr Pacitti - who had been out of work for months, despite a first-class degree in media production from Winchester University - then found himself sifting through dozens of job offers and hundreds of e-mails from well-wishers.

He said: 'Employers ended up e-mailing me contracts before we had even spoken, it was that successful. I'd say I must have had more than 100 job offers to date.'

Mr Pacitti has now landed a job with award-winning production company KEO.

The company, which is behind TV projects such as Hugh's Fish Fight, has hired him as a viral video producer, where he will specialise in creating films for the internet.

As well as promoting KEO projects, bosses have given Mr Pacitti the green light to pitch his own ideas and one of the first will give him the chance to help others in his position.

Work has started on a series in which Mr Pacitti will work with jobseekers to find innovative ways to help them find work.

He said: 'I'm really looking forward to it. I'm working on so many projects, but this is the one that is most personal to me.

'I know how difficult finding a job is, so to be given the opportunity to help other people find employment is incredibly exciting.'

Rob Love, director of KEO Digital, said: 'It was difficult not to hear about Adam.

'He managed to do a brilliant job of making lots of noise about himself in a really innovative way - both on and offline.

'Adam did something that really made him stand out as potential talent and showed a great initiative in his campaign.

'We're delighted to welcome him to KEO digital.'
