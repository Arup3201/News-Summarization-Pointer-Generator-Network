CNN reports that the student, who has not been named, confronted Johnson and told him 'it ain't over' after an incident between Johnson and the younger brother of the former student.

While he was said to have been at a wrestling match at another school at the time of Johnson's death, lawyers are now saying the bus had not left yet at the time of Johnson's death. 

An attorney for the sheriff's office confirmed the recent interviews and released a statement saying; 'The Lowndes County Sheriff's Office initiated the interviews of the Lowndes High School wrestling team coach, the bus driver and wrestling team members in response to claims made known to the sheriff's office that the wrestling team was still on the school's campus when Kendrick Johnson was last known to have been alive.'

He then added; 'The information gathered thus far indicates that the bus carrying the wrestling team had left the school's campus prior to the time that Kendrick Johnson was last known to have been alive.'

Students have reported seeing the questioned teen on the bus at the time making the time of departure the crucial element in the investigation.

Authorities had initially said that Johnson died while trying to retrieve a sneaker from inside the mat

Accounts on when exactly the bus left are remarkably varied, with some saying 10am, some saying noon, the bus driver saying 12:30pm and the actual request put into the school by the coach saying 4pm.

Johnson is believed to have died around 1:30pm of positional asphyxia, a death authorities said they believed happened when he crawled inside the gym mat to retrieve a sneaker.

The parents of the 17-year-old hired a forensic pathologist to look into the case believing that the story was cover up, who stated that he found evidence of 'unexplained, apparent nonaccidental blunt force trauma' to the neck.

The former student in question, who is not a suspect and has been charged with no crime, and his younger brother who had been in a fight with Johnson were both advised not to speak to investigators by their attorney.
