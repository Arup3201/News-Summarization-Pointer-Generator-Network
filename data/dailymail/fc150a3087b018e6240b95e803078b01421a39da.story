It was a semi-naked ring bearer wearing Superman underpants and roller skates who stole the show at a recent Texas wedding - not the bride.

Bobby and Shanna Lockhart from Lubbock decided to mix things up at their Willy Wonka-themed marriage ceremony last weekend and booked the elegant skater as a star guest.

Video footage from their big day shows the topless male performer, known as Quis, gliding along and handing over the rings at the alter.

He appears to be lost in deep concentration as he maintains a focused gaze. The congregation sit watching, open-mouthed.

Wheely in love: Bobby and Shanna Lockhart from Lubbock, Texas, decided to book a rollerskating ring bearer for their recent wedding

As he reaches his destination, Quis makes a swift exit so the ceremony can continue.

Newlywed Shanna, who works in sales for an online real estate company, says she and her husband heard about Quis via social media and thought his eccentric nature fitted perfectly with what they wanted to do.

Sticking to the 'wacky' theme, the church organ was adorned with candy-colored decorations and bags of chocolate were scattered around.

The bridesmaids - who wore dresses in all the colors of the rainbow - were also armed with giant edible lollipops in lieu of floral bouquets.

Head-turner: The performer wore a Superman outfit as he skated along, much to the congregation's amusement 

Comical: The stunt triggered laughter and applause from those watching in the pews 

Star guest: The Lockhart's flew in the Instagram-famous rollerskater in from Florida because they wanted to make their nuptials extra special 

Novel idea: The happy couple opted for a Willy Wonka-theme - chocolates were scattered everywhere, bridesmaids carried giant lollipops in lieu of floral bouquets and even the vicar got involved wearing a candy-stripe shirt 

Meanwhile, the vicar stepped out in a colorful candy-stripe shirt and chinos.

When he's not playing the role of ring bearer, Quis likes to perform other zany stunts in his skimpy hero outfit. 

He goes by the stage name 'Superman Drawls' and to date his Instagram page has attracted more than 195,000 followers.

Many fans have deemed his recent performance at the Lockhart's December 13 wedding 'epic' and 'hilarious.'

Steve Conway, who was the official photographer on the day, described it as the 'best ring delivery . . . ever!'

The Lockharts flew Quis in from Florida in a bid to make their nuptials extra special.

Footage from their ceremony shows the groom pretending to look frantically for the wedding bands.

It seems none of the groomsmen know where the rings are. But then all of a sudden 'Superman' rolls in to save the day.

'You can tell as he starts to come up the aisle, that the back row is kind of shocked,' Shanna, 33, told Fox News. 

'Then waves of laughter, then applause, then just absolute eruption. People standing up, hooping and hollering.' 

Shanna and Bobby first met in 1996 as teenagers but it took more than a decade for them to finally pin down a rendezvous. 

'On our first date in March of 2012 I knew this was forever!' newlywed Shannon said.
