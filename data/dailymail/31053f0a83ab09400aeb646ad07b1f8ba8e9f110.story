The Seattle Seahawks football team enjoyed a low-key but heart-felt homecoming to their jubilant home town on Monday, a day after trouncing the Denver Broncos 43-8 to win the Super Bowl and the franchise's first NFL championship.

The team returned to the Pacific Northwest without the opponent-rattling rumble of 'the 12th man' as its fabled home-game fan base is nicknamed, and were instead greeted by a few dozen fans cheering and chanting the team's name on the tarmac at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.

And Richard Sherman was seen hobbling down the plane steps after he injured his ankle early in the fourth quarter.

He was taken off the field on a cart and returned later on crutches.

The sedate scenes at the airport were a marked contrast to celebrations after Sunday's historic win, when a swarm of fans who had been watching the game swarmed across the city, clambering on buildings and pounding on passing cars.

The city quickly descended into chaos as 3,000 revelers swamped the centre, climbing on buildings, smashing glass and ripping down street signs.

Fans launched fireworks, blared horns and partied across the city as the final seconds of the Super Bowl ticked away. The celebration lasted into the night.

'I can't make you understand what this means to me!' shouted lifelong Seattleite John Caro, who, with his wife Corina, both 59, partied their way down Lake City Way in North Seattle. 'We have waited so freakin' long for this!'

While the game was billed as the classic battle between the NFLâ€™s finest offense and defense, the Seattle Seahawks annihilated the Denver Broncos on both sides of the ball to win the Seahawkâ€™s first Vince Lombardi Trophy.

For the fourth time in five years, the Super Bowl set a record for the most-watched television event in U.S. history, drawing 111.5 million viewers even though the Seattle Seahawks' 43-8 victory over the Denver Broncos wasn't really competitive.

'This is an amazing team. Took us four years to get to this point but they never have taken a step sideways,' said Seattle Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll, on his team's dominating win.

'These guys would not take anything but winning this ballgame.'
