Fear: Robbie Rodgers quit football after coming out but has now signed for LA Galaxy

An American footballer who used to play for Leeds United has announced he is gay and retiring from the sport aged just 25.

Robbie Rogers, a Southern California native currently based in London, made the announcement in a heartfelt blog entry.

The winger - who also played for Stevenage - revealed how he would feared he would suffer discrimination if he revealed his sexuality.

In a blog entitled ‘The Next Chapter’,
 Rogers wrote: ‘Things are never what they seem. My whole life I have 
felt different. To overcome your fears you must be strong and have faith
 in your purpose.

‘For the past 25 years I have been 
afraid to show who I really was because of fear that judgment and 
rejection would hold me back from my dreams and aspirations.'

It comes as the Football Association 
continues to try and tackle discrimination against homosexuality in the sport.

Only a handful of footballers have ever announced they are gay as many still fear coming out will damage their careers.

Footballer Justin Fashanu was the first and only English player to publicly announce he was homosexual.

The Norwich City and Nottingham Forest player committed suicide eight years later in 1998.

Rogers, who represented his country 18 times, including at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, also told how he kept his sexuality a secret even from his friends and family.

He wrote: 'Fear that 
my loved ones would be farthest from me if they knew my secret.

‘Life is only complete when your loved
 ones know you. When they know your true feelings, when they know who 
and how you love. Life is simple when your secret is gone. Gone is the 
pain that lurks in the stomach at work, the pain from avoiding 
questions, and at last the pain from hiding such a deep secret.

‘Secrets can cause so much internal 
damage. Try explaining to your loved ones after 25 years you are gay. 
Try convincing yourself that your creator has the most wonderful purpose
 for you even though you were taught differently.

‘I always thought I could hide this 
secret. Football was my escape, my purpose, my identity. Football hid my
 secret, gave me more joy than I could have ever imagined… I will always
 be thankful for my career.’

Rogers rose to prominence at
Columbus Crew in MLS, scoring 13 goals in over 100 appearances and 
earning international colors in the process.

He then moved to Leeds United, a team
 in the second tier of English football, on the advice of USA coach 
Juergen Klinsmann. Rogers struggled with injuries and, after making only
 nine appearances in five 
months on loan at Stevenage, he has decided to call it a day.

Rogers, who has more than 75,000 followers  finishes his blog with: ‘I will 
remember Beijing, The MLS Cup, and most of all my teammates. I will 
never forget the friends I have made along the way and the friends that
 supported me once they knew my secret. 

A host of MLS players and international teammates have voiced their encouragement about Rogers' decision.

New England Revolution and U.S. midfielder Benny Feilhaber wrote: 'proud to call you my friend.'

New York Red Bulls and U.S. defender Heath Pearce tweeted: 'proud of you fam!'

Chivas USA keeper Dan Kennedy offered 'ur the man Robbie we support u bro,' while teammate Juan Agudelo tweeted: 'Respect man. Proud of you bro.'

LA Galaxy and USA center back Omar Gonzalez wrote, 'Congrats, Robbie! Really happy for you.'

Gonzalez's fellow LA defender A.J. DeLaGarza tweeted, 'good for you man! All the best! Terps.'

FC Dallas goalkeeper Chris Seitz praised Rogers' courage saying, 'really want to give a huge shout out to a great friend for being one of the bravest men I know'

D.C. United's Chris Pontius wrote, 'Much respect. Nothing but support for you.'

Vancouver Whitecaps defender Jordan Harvey chimed in with: 'Congrats brotha. Wish you the best.'

Former U.S. international Sacha Kljestan wrote: '100 percent love and support for one of my best friends Robbie Rogers. You will be missed on the pitch. Amazing talent, amazing person.'

Bolton Wanderers and U.S. midfielder Stu Holden sent: 'Much love and respect to my boy @robbierogers! Proud to be your friend bro.'

Former USA star Eddie Pope hailed Rogers as a pioneer: 'Brave men like you will make it so that one day there's no need for an announcement. That day can't arrive soon enough. #support

‘Now is my time to step away. It’s 
time to discover myself away from football.  It’s 1 A.M. in London as I 
write this and I could not be happier with my decision.

'Life is so full of amazing things. I realized I could only truly enjoy my life once I was honest.

'Honesty is a bitch but makes life so 
simple and clear. My secret is gone, I am a free man, I can move on and
 live my life as my creator intended.’

Roger played for the U.S. national team 18 times, scoring twice. He featured in all three of the team's games at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup squad.

Ruth Hunt, director of public affairs
 for UK-based lesbian, gay and bisexual charity Stonewall, said: 'It's 
great that Robbie now feels able to be open about his sexuality but it 
remains a shame that no professional player feels able to be out during 
their career.

'Homophobia remains rife in football and we must work together to stop it for the sake of the game.'

Gordon
 Taylor, chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association in the 
U.K., told Press Association: 'I'm pleased that he's come out for his 
own sake. We do have players who've said that, while they are gay, they 
don't feel comfortable enough to come out.

'It's
 not dissimilar to many black players, and we need to create a safe 
environment for them on and off the field. If there is abuse, that needs
 to be dealt with by all the football family.

'It's no bad thing that he's 
been brave enough to come out. We know of players who are playing who 
are gay who've not had that confidence as yet. But, as the rest of the 
world becomes more civilized, hopefully that will come.'

Taylor
 added that the PFA remains committed to programs of education on all 
topics relating to discrimination, but that the issue is one that needs 
to be tackled by society as a whole.

'There
 needs to be a feeling that there is a comfortable environment for 
everybody,' he said. 'We're aware through our sporting chance clinic 
that players who deal with such issues at the moment feel they would be 
targeted and the attention would no longer be on them as a footballer.

'That's a real challenge. But the 
game has to be up to that. If we're going to claim to be the major sport
 in the world, both in terms of spectators and participation, then we've
 got to use that to create a better example.'

Another American player, David Testo,
 came out after retiring from football in 2011. He also played for 
Columbus Crew, albeit before Rogers, later moving to Canada where he 
played for Vancouver and Montreal.
