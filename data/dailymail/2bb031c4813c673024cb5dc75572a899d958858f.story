Bizarre hats made out of wooden planks, models with 'blacked out' faces, and some ankle swinging sportswear were among some of the truly outlandish designs which kicked off Men's fashion week.

As models dressed in outlandish outfits stalked the catwalk, British Fashion Council member David Gandy said he wants to make London the menswear capital of the world.

The ambassador for Men's Fashion Week said the event would be 'bigger than ever' this year.

While the day started sensibly enough, with
 Royal College Of Art graduate Lou Dalton's collection featuring boiled 
wool and tartan trousers, things took a slightly odd turn when  models dressed in dark workhouse greys 
paraded down the catwalk wearing hats and bizarre facial contraptions 
made of splintered planks of wood.

This being fashion week, however, everyone towed the line and applauded politely.

Jonathan Saunders and Christopher Kane will be showing their menswear 
this week.
