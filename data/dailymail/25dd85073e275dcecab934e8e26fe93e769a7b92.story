Unbowed: John Tulloch, 63, was a victim of the 7 July London bombings but faced deportation because he was born to British parents in India

A survivor of the July 7 terror attacks spoke yesterday of his relief after border officials dropped plans to deport him.

Professor John Tulloch, who was born to British parents in colonial India, had had his passport confiscated and faced expulsion from the country.

The 70-year-old university lecturer was told that as ‘a British subject without citizenship’ he was no longer entitled to remain.

But after a public outcry he has been granted indefinite leave to stay and invited to apply for citizenship. He will then be able to get a new passport.

Professor Tulloch said he was ‘thrilled’ by the U-turn. The threat of deportation had hurt him more than the 7/7 attack, he said.

His bloodied and bandaged face became one of the defining images of the 2005 London bombings.

Prince Charles visited him in hospital and said he exemplified the ‘resilience of the British people’.

The decision to deny him the right to remain in the UK provoked widespread anger.

MPs said it was ‘utterly wrong’ at a time when the likes of hate preacher Abu Qatada are allowed to stay on the grounds that deportation would infringe their human rights. Professor Tulloch – who married a British woman, has two British sons and can trace his British ancestry to the 14th century – called the decision to let him stay ‘incredible’.

He said: ‘It’s just extraordinary. I am absolutely thrilled. I was banging my head against a wall trying to get this sorted out – I’d never before encountered so much frustration. It was like Kafka.

‘I phoned the UK Border Agency 15 times in one month alone, getting a different young person each time. You could never get anybody on the phone who understood the issues.’

Professor Tulloch’s British father served in Burma as a major in the Army, and his grandfather and great-grandfather both worked for the British government in India.

Yet he was told there was no prospect of him being allowed to stay in the UK, let alone being considered for citizenship.

Professor Tulloch was raised and educated in Britain from the age of three after his parents returned to the country with him.

After a degree at Cambridge he embarked on an academic career and has held a series of posts at British universities. He owns the flat where he lives in Penarth, near Cardiff. But unknown to him his birth in colonial India meant he was classed as a ‘British subject without citizenship’.

When Professor Tulloch was first issued with a British passport he said he was never told he did not have citizenship.

He later accepted a job in Australia and was granted Australian citizenship.

But
 when he applied to renew his  passport it was confiscated and he was 
told his right to live in Britain had been cancelled when he was granted
 Australian citizenship.

He was only able to return to the UK under a work permit. Professor Tulloch, head of the School of Journalism at Cardiff University, was later informed that he could not remain permanently. He was also denied the right to apply for naturalisation as a British citizen.

Of the U-turn, he said: ‘The indefinite leave to remain is as much as I needed to function, but the passport is symbolic.

‘As much as anything, it’s what is due to my family.

'They would be so delighted that the service they gave is finally recognised.’

Last night the Home Office declined to comment.

Professor Tulloch had been sitting opposite July 7 ringleader Mohammed Sidique Khan when the  suicide bomber detonated his explosives on a Tube train at Edgware Road.

The academic suffered serious injuries to his ear drums and still has post-traumatic stress disorder.
