Militant teachers put themselves on a collision course with the Government yesterday, calling for a boycott of school inspections and backing a spate of strikes.

Delegates at the National Union of Teachers conference voiced their fury at school reforms introduced by Michael Gove. Several said the Education Secretary  had lost the confidence of teachers as delegates chanted: ‘Gove must go, Gove must go.’

Others said they had no confidence in Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw, whose school inspection regime is widely resented and blamed for raising teachers’ stress levels and suicide rates.

Delegates later confirmed plans by the NUT and the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers to hold joint strikes, starting with regional action in June and escalating to a national walkout in autumn.

Teachers agreed to strike over pay and pensions this week, despite Mr Gove insisting that both issues were 'fixed'.

Both the Education Secretary and the teachers' unions have refused to back down from the stalemate.

At the National Union of Teachers annual conference, general secretary Christine Blower said: 'We are not rowing back... We have put these reasonable demands and we want to talk to him about them, not just have him send us a letter.'

She also rounded on Mr Gove for previously calling his critics ‘enemies of promise’.

‘I think people were astonished when Michael Gove used the expression "enemies of promise",' she said. ‘It seemed to teachers whom I have talked to about it that he has no idea what goes on in schools up and down the country.

‘If you’ve ever been into a primary or secondary school on a normal 
working day, you will find teachers working extremely hard, even in the 
face of Government interventions, and children being taught incredibly 
interesting and exciting lessons.’

Her comments in Liverpool came after Mr Gove wrote to unions saying he was willing to meet but the 'direction of travel' on key issues was 'fixed'.

The NUT and National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers last week announced rolling strikes from June 27, with a national walkout before Christmas.

Speaking at the NUT annual conference in Liverpool today, general secretary Christine Blower warned Mr Gove that the unions stand firm in their position.

This week, Mr Gove wrote to the NUT and the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT) to say he was willing to meet the unions to discuss the issues, but insisting that the ‘direction of travel’ on both pensions and pay is ‘fixed’.

Ms Blower said: ‘Negotiation is about sitting across the table having an exchange and listening to people.

‘What he’s saying is pay and pensions are done and dusted, and there’s no reason to talk about it. That’s not our view.’

The unions put a list of demands to Mr Gove, calling on him to suspend the introduction of performance-related pay, due to be brought in later this year, and to publish an evaluation of the Teachers’ Pension Scheme.

They also wanted him to ‘commit to genuine engagement’ by setting up a series of meetings to discuss the dispute.

In his letter to the unions, Mr Gove said he would be ‘very happy’ to meet them, but he warned: ‘While I am happy to discuss any issue you have, I shall stress in advance that on changes to teachers’ pension and pay arrangements, the direction of travel is now fixed.

In both cases, there has been full consultation with trade unions including the NASUWT and the NUT.’

In
her response to the letter, NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates said:
‘This is a serious situation which requires a more measured response 
than this display of arrogance and belligerence from the Secretary of 
State.

‘As far as we are 
concerned we remain committed to engaging in genuine discussions and our
original demands still remain on the table.’
