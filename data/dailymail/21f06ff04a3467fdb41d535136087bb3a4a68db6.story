Syria's First Lady Asma Al Assad is pregnant according to Beirut-based al-Akhbar newspaper

Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad’s British-born wife is pregnant, according to reports.

The dictator is said to have told mysteriously anonymous Arab 'visitors' to Syria, who passed it on to Beirut newspaper al-Akhbar, generally regarded as sympathetic to his regime.

The London-born mother of three, Asma Assad, 37, once described by Vogue magazine as a 
‘rose in the desert’, has not been seen in public in recent months, making the claim hard to substantiate.

Efforts by MailOnline to confirm the report with her father Dr Fawaz Akhras, a Cromwell Hospital and Harley Street cardiologist failed.

The al-Akhbar article focused on Assad's take on the ongoing civil war that has gripped Syria for the last two years and his confidence in his army's ultimate success.

It said: 'On the personal level, the man seems 
calm and in control.

'His confidence level stands out. Also there’s the 
news of the pregnancy of his wife Asma, which could not be dealt with as
a simple personal matter between a couple.'

Though a Muslim, Asma Assad went to a Church of England school, where she was known as Emma.

After
studying computer science and French literature at King’s  College 
London, she worked as a banker at JP Morgan in the Nineties when she met
her future husband.

At the time, Assad was training at a hospital in London to become an eye surgeon.

It is not the first time rumours of the First Lady's pregnancy have circulated.

In November a Syrian news agency called Akhbar Shabab 
Soriya (Syria Youth News) said she was five months pregnant. Should this be the case the baby would be due in March.

Earlier this month Assad and his family were reported to be living on a warship guarded by the Russian navy.

The embattled dictator was said to 
have moved with his family and a select band of aides to the warship off
Syria's coast while he travelled by helicopter to Damascus to attend meetings in his presidential palace.

The move was said to have come about after the president lost confidence in his own security detail.

Emails obtained by WikiLeaks and reported in the mainstream media last year revealed that Mrs
Assad, 36, spent £270,000 buying furniture from an exclusive London 
store for one of her presidential palaces in 2011 – as Syria was 
descending into a bloody civil war.

Her order included five 
chandeliers costing £8,800 at upmarket furniture store DN Designs in 
the King’s Road, Chelsea, West London.

In September 2011 international condemnation of the Syrian regime grew and sanctions were imposed against the country by the US and the EU, although Mrs Assad was still preoccupied with her furnishings.

Hands bound behind them and shot in the head: Merciless executions of 65 people dumped by a river in Aleppo

By 
Jill Reilly

A horrifying video has been released showing dozens of corpses with their hands tied behind their backs lined up by a river in Syria.

The bodies of at least 65 men and boys, apparently shot 
in the head, were found in a district of the
northern Syrian city of Aleppo earlier today.

Blood was seeping from their heads 
and some of them appeared to be young, possibly teenagers, dressed 
in jeans, shirts and trainers. 

A Free Syrian Army captain said that many more bodies were still being dragged from the water.

Opposition activists posted a video of a
man filming at least 51 muddied male bodies alongside what they said 
was the Queiq River in the rebel-held Bustan al-Qasr neighbourhood of 
Aleppo.

The British-based Syrian Observatory 
for Human Rights, which says it provides objective information about 
casualties on both sides of Syria's war from a network of monitors, said
the death toll could rise as high as 80.

It was not clear who had carried out the killings.

The Queiq River rises in Turkey and travels through government-held districts of Aleppo before it reaches Bustan al-Qasr.'They were killed only because they are Muslims,' said a bearded man in another video said to have been filmed in central Bustan al-Qasr after the bodies were removed from the river.

A pickup truck with a pile of corpses was parked behind him.

It is not clear who carried out the killings - human rights groups have accused both government forces and the rebels of carrying out summary executions.

Government forces and rebels in Syria have both been accused by human rights groups of carrying out summary executions in the 22-month-old conflict, which has claimed more than 60,000 lives.

Rebels pushed into Aleppo, Syria's most populous city, over the summer, but are stuck in a stalemate with government forces.

The city is divided roughly in half between the two sides.

The revolt started as a peaceful protest movement against more than four decades of rule by President Bashar al-Assad and his family, but turned into an armed rebellion after a government crackdown.

More than 700,000 people have fled, the United Nations says.

Syrian rebels stormed a government intelligence complex in the oil-rich east of the country on Tuesday, freeing at least 11 people held in a prison at the facility, activists said.

After five days of heavy clashes around the intelligence compound in the city of Deir el-Zour, rebels finally overran the complex early Tuesday following intense fighting overnight, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

Opposition figures were reportedly being held at the jail on the complex's grounds, but it was not immediately clear whether those freed Tuesday are fighters or activists.

Government forces responded to the rebel advance by unleashing a series of airstrikes on the compound, trying to push the opposition fighters from the facility.

The aid group Doctors Without Borders said last month that government forces are shelling and bombing Deir el-Zour almost daily. It said tens of thousands of Syrians, many of them wounded, remain trapped in the city.

Also Tuesday, regime warplanes also carried several airstrikes on rebel positions in restive towns and villages around Damascus, including eastern Ghouta and Yalda, and hit other suburbs with artillery, the Observatory said. The group relies on the reports from activists on the ground.

After capturing several major army bases and government outposts, the rebels control large swathes of land in northeastern Syria.

Assad's troops, however, continue to hold a tight grip on the capital after nearly two years of conflict.

The areas on the capital's doorstep have been rebel strongholds since early on in the revolt. In recent months, the rebels have used them as a base from which they have been trying to push into central Damascus, the seat of Assad's power.
