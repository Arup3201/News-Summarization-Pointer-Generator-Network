A British security team was sent to the popular Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh to assess the terror threat ahead of the tourist season.

Every year thousands of British holidaymakers travel to the resort on the Red Sea but with the Easter holidays approaching, the government is reviewing advice to those heading to the southern Sinai region.

After a tourist bus carrying 30 holidaymakers was attacked in Taba in South Sinai, close to the border with Israel in February, a team thought to include armed forces personnel was sent to investigate the vulnerability of nearby Sharm el-Sheikh.

The Egyptian bus driver was killed, along with three tourists from South Korea, who had been visiting Christian sites in the region, in the bombing on February 16.

According to Egyptian Interior Ministry spokesman Hani Abdel-Latif, the driver and two tourists had got out of the bus to check the cargo hold but as they were re-boarding, a suicide bomber pushed through the open door into the bus and detonated his explosives.

Militant Islamic group Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, Arabic for Champions of Jerusalem, which had previously only targetted police and the military, claimed responsibility for the roadside attack, saying one of its â€˜heroesâ€™ carried out the bombing.

Several holiday companies stopped sending tourists to the area following the bombing, and operators Thomas Cook and Tui decided to fly German tourists home early on the advice of the government in Berlin.

The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office updated guidance given to tourists after the blast, warning against travelling
 to other Red Sea resorts including Taba, Nuweiba and Dahab, and advising against taking excursions to historic sites including St Catherine's 
Monastery and Petra in Jordan.

It said tourists should stay within the Sharm el-Sheikh resort area, where enhanced security measures were in place, including Egyptian military check points around the resort including at the airport. 

The Egyptian government believes that safety concerns have now been addressed and yesterday the country's ambassador to London said the FCO restrictions did not need to be tightened, despite a number of attacks by Islamist groups protesting the overthrowing of former President Mohammed Morsi - the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood.

'We have had a team from the security 
forces of Britain in the tourist areas to monitor the measures and see 
what measures are in place that are satisfactory,' Ashraf Elkholy told 
the Daily Telegraph.

'The security team has been there and we have cooperated and we hope that the decision taken will be the right one.'

Officials from the FCO have said there would be no immediate change in travel advice for Sharm el-Sheikh, but that the situation was being monitored and the information would be updated if necessary.

Elections are due to be held to elect a new president next month, after President Morsi was deposed by the Egyptian military, and protesting groups are expected to target the polls.

The country's powerful former military 
chief Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who led the overthrow of Islamist President
 Morsi last summer, has announced his bid for office and is 
widely expected to win.

'What we have to expect during 
this procedure is an increase in terrorist action as they have to prove 
themselves and unfortunately Egyptians and non-Egyptians will be the 
targets of this,' said Mr Elkholy.

Companies including Thomas Cook and Tui continue to provide package holidays to the area - which is popular with many British tourists who flock to its many beaches, due to the year-round warm climate and clear waters.

Loss: It was revealed last month that Egypt had seen a 28 per cent drop in the number of tourists visiting the country this year

However, it was revealed last month that Egypt had seen a 28 per cent drop in the number of tourists visiting the country this year.

According to the statistics released by Egypt's Ahram newspaper, there has been a 24 per cent drop in European tourists visiting the country in January and February this year, when compared to 2013 figures.

They contribute to an overall 28 per cent decrease in visitor numbers when visitors form other key markets, such as the Middle East and Arab countries, are taken into account.

One of the biggest losses was from the Asia and Pacific markets, with 42 per cent less visitors venturing to Egypt than during the same period last year.

The country's tourism sector accounts 
for roughly nine per cent of GDP, but has experienced several setbacks 
since President Hosni Mubarak was forced to step down in 2011.

In
 2010, Egypt received 14.7million visitors, which was a record high, but
 numbers dipped to just 10million in 2011 before climbing again to 
11.5million in 2012.
