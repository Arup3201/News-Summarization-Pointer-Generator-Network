Morrisons is slashing the price of 1,200 everyday food essentials by up to 60 per cent, triggering a bloody price war that will force rivals to follow suit.

The move by Britain’s fourth biggest supermarket is part of a £1billion plan to permanently reduce prices in a bid to see off the threat posed by budget rivals Aldi and Lidl.

However, the price re-set will also drag the other members of the grocery big four – Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s – into the fray.

All these rivals have price pledges which means they will have to match – or beat – the reductions offered by Morrisons if they want to keep their promises to shoppers.

The price cuts represent a huge gamble for Morrisons, however bosses see a permanent shift to discount prices as the only way to reverse a long running fall in shopper numbers, sales and profits.

The fall-out of the battle for customers means that millions are in line to see significant savings which should hasten the end of a five year cost of living squeeze that has brought real hardship.

The average price cut on the 1,200 lines is 17per cent, however a number of high profile products are down by between 25per cent and 60per cent.

Morrisons British butter is down by a third from £1.49 to £1, its 500g packs of beef mince are down by 20per cent, bacon by 15per cent, Huggies wipes by 60per cent and an eight-pack of Diet Coke by 40per cent.

One former executive has warned that the change in strategy is so serious for Morrisons’ finances and future that it has become a ‘supertanker headed towards an iceberg’.

If that is the case, it may well also drag down its much bigger rivals by forcing them to accept lower prices and profits for years to come.

The chief executive, Dalton Philips first announced a shift to permanent low prices in March, however the chain is now putting flesh on to the bones of its initiative.

He said: ‘Morrisons is now cheaper.  We are cutting prices not corners.  We are making great food even more affordable and, in doing so, giving more reasons for customers to shop with us.’

In the past, all the major supermarkets have launched price cut promotions, boasting of bigger and better offers. However, these have often not offered the savings claimed, leaving shoppers sceptical and confused.

Morrisons is to challenge this problem by launching a website in May that will show the price history of products on its shelves to offer reassurances that they are showing genuine reductions.

Mr Philips said: ‘We’re serious about getting cheaper and setting new standards in transparency of pricing.

'We want our customers to be proud of the products they buy and be reassured that they are cheaper.  We have nothing to hide.’

The chain will back up the cuts by a new marketing campaign under the strapline ‘I’m Your New Cheaper Morrisons’.

The first TV commercials will run tonight around Coronation Street and Emmerdale.

Morrisons has an advantage over some of its big name rivals in that it processes and manufacturers a lot of food it sells, rather than relying on third party suppliers.

The firm said: ‘We will be leveraging this vertically integrated structure to control to quality of products and to keep prices down, cost which competitors will find it hard to match.’

City analysts have long predicted that only significant price cuts by the ‘big four’ stores will allow them to fend off the challenge of the German budget chains Aldi and Lidl.

Recent industry figures show Aldi sales rising at 35.3per cent a year, while those at Lidl are up 17.2per cent as both make a concerted effort to expand and move into Middle Britain towns

By contrast, sales at Morrisons were down by 3.8per cent on a year ago, Tesco by 3per cent, Sainsbury’s by 1.7per cent and Asda, which is owned by Wal-Mart of the USA by 0.5per cent.

Earlier this year, Morrisons dismayed City analysts with a report of a pre-tax loss of £176million for the year to February 2, compared with a pre-tax profit of

£879m the year before. Turnover fell by 2per cent to £17.7bn.

The firm has suffered because it was late to follow rivals and open smaller convenience stores, while it delayed launching an internet grocery service. It is now addressing these, while it has also signed an expensive advertising deal featuring Ant and Dec.

The Morrisons change to prices is enormously risky and controversial. Former executive, Roger Owen, a property director with the supermarket for 22 years until 2009, recently claimed that the chief executive, Mr Philips, was ‘out of his depth’, while he said the chairman, Sir Ian Gibson, should stand down.

It has emerged that he wrote a letter to Sir Ian spelling out his ‘increasing sadness at the unarguable decline of the company I helped build’, while he suggested it was a supertanker heading for an iceberg.

The chain described his attacks as ‘unhelpful’ and ‘unwelcome’ and suggested Mr Owen should take some responsibility for the problems the current management are wrestling with.

A source said: ‘He might be better served taking more of a thoughtful view of his role as a director of a board that left Morrisons, uniquely amongst the big grocers, with no online and no convenience offer.’
