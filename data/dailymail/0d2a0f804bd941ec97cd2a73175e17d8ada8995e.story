Manchester City, who thought they would escape the Allianz Arena with a hard fought draw, succumbed to a late Bayern Munich winner, scored by Jerome Boateng.

Here, Sportsmail's Joe Bernstein gives his verdict on the performances of both sets of players.

BAYERN (4-3-3)

MANUEL NEUER  - Made everything look ridiculously easy including a near-post save from Edin Dzeko. 7

Thomas Muller had an opportunity to score in the first couple of minutes but put his shot inches wide

RAFINHA - Plenty of energy as a right wing-back but not always the highest quality. 6.5  

JEROME BOATENG -Excellent reading of the game. His wasted season at City is a mystery and after being foiled by Hart, he broke their hearts with a late, late strike. 7.5 

MEHDI BENATIA - Didn't take any prisoners, appearing to knee Silva in the back at one stage. 6.5

JUAN BERNAT - Dangerous on the left-hand side, with fantastic delivery from wide areas. 7.5

Fernandinho played well for Manchester City and set the tone in the centre of the park

PHILIPP LAHM - The man is a machine. Nothing spectacular but always a leader. 6.5

XABIO ALONSO- Seems to have got over his World Cup loss of form. Neat and tidy. 6.5

DAVID ALABA - His pace and movement caused City problems. Always a threat. 7

THOMAS MULLER - Excellent movement but left his prolific World Cup scoring form at home. 6.5

ROBERT LEWANDOWSKI - Looks ungainly but he gave the Bayern attack a focal point. 6.5

Mehdi Benatia, who was making his Champions League debut against City, challenges Samir Nasri 

MARIO GOTZE - Denied by Joe Hart when set to add to his famous goals collection. 7 

SUBS 

Robben 76 (for Muller) 5.5 - The best and worst, great dribble followed by Olympic dive as Fernandinho came across to challenge 

Claudio Pizarro 84 (for Rafinha), 

Dante (for Benatia 85) 

PEP GUARDIOLA - Got it right tactically, though the win was late in coming. 7.5 

Robert Lewandowski has endured a slower than expected start at Bayern Munich since his summer move

Man City (4-5-1)

JOE HART -Back to his best with a string of saves particularly from Muller, Gotze, Bernat and Boateng. He didn't deserve to end up on the losing side. 9

BACARY SAGNA - Given the nod at right-back and survived early penalty shout on Muller. 6.5

VINCENT KOMPANY- The sort of dogfight he loved. A great battle with Lewandowski. 7

MARTIN DEMICHELIS - No reason for Pellegrini to use £32m Mangala with Demichelis steady. 6.5

GAEL CLICHY - Over-worked and no surprise when he was booked for foul on Rafinha. 6

Jesus Navas enjoyed a rare start as Manuel pellegrini opted to begin the match with a five-man midfield

SAMIR NASRI - Speed of game seemed to pass him by. Replaced by James Milner. 5.5

FERNANDINHO - Couldn't stem Bayern fully and relieved his handball was judged accidental. 6

YAYA TOURE- Rested at weekend to recover from Ivory Coast duty. Hasn't recovered. 5.5

JESUS NAVAS - His blistering pace was a good outlet. One sprint and cross set up Silva. 6

Bacary Sagna played well in his first Champions League match for Manuel Pellegrini's side

DAVID SILVA- What a player. Set up Dzeko with a pass of beauty & nearly headed a winner. 7.5

EDIN DZEKO - Tried manfully in lone striker's role and took the hits, but blew his goal chance. 6

SUBS

Milner 58 (for Nasri) 6 - The discipline you'd expect from Milner in a central midfield role 

Aguero 74 (for Dzeko) 5.5 - City on the backfoot by the time he came on

Kolarov 87 (for Navas) 

MANUEL PELLEGRINI - Outplayed but can claim his tough love to Joe Hart has worked. 6.5

REFEREE

UNDIANO MALLENCO - Did well to control a full-blooded match. 6.5

In-form Bosnian forward Edin Dzeko was preferred up front to Sergio Aguero for Manchester City
