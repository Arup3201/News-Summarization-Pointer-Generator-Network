The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge could be waking with sore heads on Monday morning after they attend an exclusive wine-tasting event during the royal tour.

William and Kate will be heading to Central Otago in Queenstown on Sunday where 30 wineries will be showcasing selections of their finest produce.

With a focus on Pinot Noir, the variety the region is famous for, the royal couple will also be able to sample Riesling, Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, as well as sparkling wines.

The Duke and Duchess - along with Prince George - are on a three-week tour Down Under, which started in New Zealand on April 7 and ends in Australia on Anzac Day.

Winery Amisfield, which is idyllically located overlooking the stunning Lake Hayes with its vineyard overlooking the Pisa mountain range, will be hosting the royal couple on Sunday for the event, which is being billed as the ‘most important wine tasting of the century’.

Central Otago Winegrowers Association president James Dicey will be escorting the Duke through the tasting, while Central Otago Pinot Noir Chairwoman Lucie Lawrence will accompany the Duchess.

Mr Dicey called it ‘an absolute privilege’, adding he was ‘nervous’ about spending time with the royal couple.

‘My friends have been teasing me about what I am going to wear on the day,’ he said.

‘It’s a fantastic opportunity and once-in-a-lifetime chance to have one-on-one time with William and talk him through our region’s wines.

‘I’m excited and a little nervous about the event given the level of international interest surrounding their visit.’

Kate and William will also have the chance to tour the wine facility, which is usually open to the public, learning about what makes the wines so unique.

Mr Dicey said: ‘It will very much be an informal event with us walking around chatting to the various winemakers, growers and owners representing each of their wineries.

‘The Royal couple have asked to meet people of a similar age and those at the forefront of winemaking and they seem to have a real interest in wine.’

Thirty wineries will be represented with wines available from each for the royal couple to sample – and each variety will be matched with food crafted by the award-winning team at Amisfield.

‘The special menu is being kept under wraps until the day but suffice to say the Royals will be treated to a wonderful local food and wine experience which we hope they will remember forever,’ Mr Dicey added.

‘The eyes of the world will be on Central Otago wine this weekend and we’re just over the moon to be a part of the royal visit.’

And in terms of a tourism boost, Mr Dicey said: ‘We certainly expect interest in the region to significantly increase following the royal visit.’

Kate and William arrived in New Zealand on Sunday, and have been staying at Government House in Wellington. Their first official duties included attending Plunkett's Parent's Group with Prince George.
