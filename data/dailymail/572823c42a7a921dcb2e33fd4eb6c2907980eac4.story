Swingers in tech-obsessed Silicon Valley have tuend to apps to help aid them in their sex partner swaps and alternative lifestyle parties.

Where once there were random key exchanges, entrepreneurs like Ben Fuller have created technology to bring together San Francisco Bay engineers who fancy other techies' husbands and wives.

At Fuller's Bronze Party, he says some attendees first chase away their inhibitions with a cocktail while others show up already confident about who they plan to approach thanks to something members use to prep for the event called Auto-date.

'[It] allows you into the party itself, to choose the people that you're interested in, and if you choose and they choose, you get a notification,' Fuller told CNN.

And by virtue of his clientele's profession, Fuller says he's always getting helpful hints and tweaks to the technology he uses.

CNN's Laurie Segall, who interviewed Fuller, said in a recent Reddit AMA:

'Lots of engineers, a mobile developer who worked at a big Silicon Valley company, a lawyer - all types. 

'What was interesting was the guy who started the bronze party (swingers event I attended) said a lot of startup people would come to events and then help him with his website and getting around gmail filters.'

So what happens at a Silicon Valley sex party?

According to husband and wife engineers who've been together 10 years, it's a lot like a typical night out.

'Whereas you might go to a bar, pick up somebody and take them home for the evening if you're single, here it wouldn't be unheard of to do that even if you're married,' said the couple's husband half.

He also said it's not just Fuller's apps he and his compatriots use to find like-minded people.

'We just heard from a threesome -- two women and a man -- who said "Oh, we heard about it on [anonymous posting site] Secret."'
