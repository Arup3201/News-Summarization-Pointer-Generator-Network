They may appear cute and cuddly, but as one alligator soon learned, otters can be vicious predators.

These photos show an otter overpowering a juvenile gator and despite the reptile doing its best, it was no match for the fanged weasel-cousin.

The animals were spotted at Lake Woodruff National Wildlife Refuge in Florida, where it soon became clear that the otter was in it to win it.

P-otter and Voldemort: Although an alligator would traditionally be seen as the superior predator in this fight, it did not stand a chance against the otter

oh, snap: The animals were photographed at Lake Woodruff National Wildlife Refuge in Florida, where the otter attacked the juvenile alligator, completely overpowering the reptile

The otter attacked the relatively young gator by biting it over the neck, ensuring it could not turn around and bite back.

After a short struggle, the otter was able to drag the reptile onto a riverbank and out of sight.

It then proceeded to eat the animal alive, validated by the ‘crunching noises’ that could be heard from the bank.

Despite their adorable appearance, otters are the apex predator of many freshwater species.

Otterly terrifying: The photographer said he was certain the otter ate the alligator because of the 'crunching noises'

Although
 they mainly feed on fish, they often add shellfish, crabs and small 
mammals to their diet and it is not unheard of that they go for larger 
animals and reptiles such as juvenile or small alligators.

North American river otters can grow to be three to four feet long and weigh between 10 and 30lbs and must eat the equivalent of 15 per cent of their own body weight each day to keep warm.

The attack took place at a 21,574 acre wildlife refuge along the St. Johns River near DeLeon Springs.

Its
 geographical location, which overlaps subtropical and temperate 
climates allows for a high diversity in types of animals, including 215 
species of birds, 22 species of amphibian and 50 species of reptiles.
