A girl of seven was secretly bitten by a tour guide in Thailand when she refused to let him kiss her.

The girl's mother is suing her travel agency in China over the attack, which occurred during a six-day trip to Thailand that was a reward for the girl's good grades in school.

Chen Ting, 36, said daughter Chen Yin had seemed unusually quiet during the trip, and on the final day as they waited at the airport before flying home, the girl began crying and complaining that her arm and stomach were hurting.

Mrs Chen then found bite marks on her daughter, and discovered that Chinese tour guide Zhou Fang was allegedly responsible. 

'At the time I clearly saw some teeth marks on my daughter's left arm, the skin in the area was abraded, the same with her belly,' she told People's Daily Online.

When Ms Chen complained to the guide, she claimed he refused to apologise and simply walked away.

Once she returned to China she complained to the travel agency, and an investigation in Thailand allegedly found that another tourist saw the the guide ask the little girl for a kiss.

In her complaint letter, the mother said: 'When I saw my daughter in tears and listened to her story, I checked and found obvious bite marks in places where she couldn't have done it herself.

'She said the guide had bitten her after telling her: "You are very pretty. You're leaving soon and it's hard to see you go. Come here and let me give you a kiss".'

When she refused, he had grabbed her anyway and then bit her on the stomach. She managed to break free and run behind some luggage where he grabbed her again, and this time bit her on the arm.

The girl's mother has had her daughter tested in case she was infected with any diseases by the bites

Other passengers questioned in the investigation confirmed that they had often seen the guide pestering little girl when he thought her mother was not looking.

She added: 'I was particularly worried that he might have some disease and my kid would be infected.

'My child is introvert. She has hidden in her bed and cried [because of the bites].'

She added that the girl even said she regretted getting good grades at school – because without them she would not have gone on the trip and met the man. 

The daughter also mentioned she 'never wanted to travel with groups anymore.'

Chen has now taken the local Chongqing travel agency to court where the agency confirmed that the guide been fired, but they said they were powerless to force him to take a medical test to prove he did not have any diseases.
