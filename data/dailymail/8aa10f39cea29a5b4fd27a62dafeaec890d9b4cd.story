John Carver could stay in charge of Newcastle United until at least the end of the season should he impress over the coming two matches.

The caretaker boss would love the chance to prove his worth at the helm of his hometown club and will communicate as much to owner Mike Ashley, with whom he has a good relationship.

Carver fits the bill of 'head coach' which the club are looking to appoint and he is popular within the dressing room.

His future could well be determined by the outcome of matches against Burnley on New Year’s Day and the FA Cup tie at Leicester City 48 hours later.

But with Newcastle in the relative comfort of mid-table, there is a feeling that Ashley could take a chance on someone like Carver until the end of the campaign, especially if efforts to bring in an external candidate prove troublesome.

The 49-year-old has served on and off at the club in a coaching capacity since the early Nineties having been a reserve-team player with the Magpies before injury curtailed his career.

Steve Bruce, meanwhile, appears to have ruled himself out of the running for the position at St James’ Park, although were an approach forthcoming that stance could well change.

Derby boss Steve McClaren is thought to be another name the United hierarchy are considering.

Any appointment, however, is not expected until next week at the earliest.
