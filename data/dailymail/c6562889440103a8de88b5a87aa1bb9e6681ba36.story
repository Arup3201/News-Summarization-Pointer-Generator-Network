Astronomers have watched as a black hole woke up from a decades-long slumber to feed on a nearby giant planet.

The discovery in galaxy NGC 4845, 47 million light-years away, was made by ESA's INTEGRAL space observatory.

A similar feeding event, albeit on a 
gas cloud, will soon happen at the black hole at the centre of our own 
Milky Way Galaxy, astronomers say.

Astronomers were able to capture a black hole waking up from a decades-long slumber to feed on a low-mass object - either a brown dwarf or a giant planet - that strayed too close.

The flaring event in NGC 4845 can
be seen as a warm-up act for a similar event expected in the 
supermassive black hole at the centre of our own Milky Way Galaxy, 
perhaps even this year.

While
there are no brown dwarfs or planets on the menu this time, a compact 
cloud of gas amounting to just a few Earth masses has been seen 
spiralling towards the black hole and is predicted to meet its fate 
soon.

'The observation was completely 
unexpected, from a galaxy that has been quiet for at least 20–30 years,'
says Marek Nikolajuk of the University of Bialystok, Poland, lead 
author of the paper in Astronomy & Astrophysics.

Astronomers were using INTEGRAL to study
a different galaxy when they noticed a bright X-ray flare coming from 
another location in the same wide field-of-view. Using XMM-Newton, the 
origin was confirmed as NGC 4845, a galaxy never before detected at high
energies.Along with 
Swift and MAXI, the emission was traced from its maximum in January 
2011, when the galaxy brightened by a factor of a thousand, and then as 
it subsided over the course of the year.

By analysing the characteristics of 
the flare, the astronomers could determine that the emission came from a
halo of material around the galaxy's central black hole as it tore 
apart and fed on an object of 14–30 Jupiter masses.

This size range corresponds to brown 
dwarfs, substellar objects that are not massive enough to fuse hydrogen 
in their core and ignite as stars.

However,
the authors note that it could have had an even lower mass, just a few 
times that of Jupiter, placing it in the range of gas-giant planets.

The black hole in the centre of NGC 4845 is estimated to have a mass of around 300 000 times that of our own Sun.

It also likes to play with its food: 
the way the emission brightened and decayed shows there was a delay of 
2–3 months between the object being disrupted and the heating of the 
debris in the vicinity of the black hole.

'This
is the first time where we have seen the disruption of a substellar 
object by a black hole,' adds co-author Roland Walter of the Observatory
of Geneva, Switzerland.'We
estimate that only its external layers were eaten by the black hole, 
amounting to about 10% of the object's total mass, and that a denser 
core has been left orbiting the black hole.'
