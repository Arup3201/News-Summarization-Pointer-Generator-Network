A benefits cheat who claimed he couldn’t walk without excruciating pain was caught on camera stock car racing, a court heard today.

Peter Wilkes, 45, said he was unable to get out of the bath because he had a bad back - but he was caught racing his vehicle and pushing a car up a ramp.

The fraudster, who hobbled into court today in a grey suit was filmed on six separate occasions racing his beaten-up stock car at Trent Raceway in Needwood, Staffordshire, between August 22 and October 17, 2010.

Benefit cheat: Peter Wilkes, 45, is caught carrying two tyres - even though he said a back injury left him in excruciating pain and unable to work

Racer: Wilkes was seen on six separate occasions at Trent Raceway in Needwood, Staffordshire, between August 22 and October 17, 2010

Fraud: Peter Wilkes posted videos of himself racing on YouTube

Today he escaped a jail sentence and was fined just £300. He was immediately able to repay the money because of an inheritance.

Burton Magistrates Court was shown footage of Wilkes driving a red stock car with the number ‘39’ emblazoned on its side and a banner reading ‘Pete Wilkes’ plastered across the windscreen.

Prosecutor Paul Kay told magistrates that Wilkes competed in up to three races each day at the fortnightly meetings.

Wilkes was also caught on film climbing backwards out of a passenger window and walking around the raceway’s grounds.

In one video he can be seen speeding around the circular course, his car bouncing up and down as it careers along the bumpy ground.

He also posted his own videos on YouTube - which he wrote were filmed by his son.

After several laps, Wilkes collides with another car and spins out before driving into a pit area in the middle of the track.

He then unbuckles himself and clambers backwards out of the car with apparent ease.

Accompanied by his son, he can also be seen walking around the raceway without a limp, laughing and joking with friends and buying hamburgers from a race-side vendor.

The court heard that Wilkes, who damaged several vertebrae in a footballing accident in 1991, had no feeling below his left knee.

On his latest Disability Living Allowance claim form, dated December 10, 2008, he claimed that he could not walk on uneven ground without stumbling, could not bend over and often struggled to dress himself without assistance.

In interviews with Department for Work and Pensions officials in December 2010, Wilkes said that he was 'permanently in severe discomfort, every step hurts.'

He fraudulently claimed £4,439 in Disability Living allowance between September 2009 and December 2010.

Today he was found guilty of failing to notify the DWP of a change in circumstances affecting his entitlement to benefits.

Sentencing Wilkes, magistrate Andrew Nelson said: 'We have considered the defendant’s original claim for disability allowance to be genuine.

'The defendant was seen racing a stock car, getting in and out of it and even pushing it along with others.

'Therefore it is clear that while his doctor confirms the condition remains, it has improved and he failed to notify the Department for Work and Pensions of this.'

Guilty: Peter Wilkes, 45, arrives at court today where he was ordered to pay the money back and was given a fine. He says he has no income

John Walsh, defending, said: 'Because of an inheritance, rather than any saved income, he was able to repay it straight away.'

Wilkes, from Lichfield, Staffordshire, was fined £300, and ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £15 and costs of £250.

Speaking outside court he called the decision 'completely unfair' and vowed he would do the same again.

He said: 'I didn’t know in this day and age you needed to get permission to do something.

'I have no income, none at all, so what am I expected to use to pay this fine?

'When I went racing my son was my mechanic. Because of the experience he got there he now has a job as a mechanic.

'So to help my son like that I’d do it all over again.'
