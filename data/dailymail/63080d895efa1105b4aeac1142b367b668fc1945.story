David Cameron found himself at odds with schoolfriend Charlie Brooks yesterday over extraordinary claims that he snubbed a call from Barack Obama to carry on a game of tennis.

Mr Brooks, a member of the so-called ‘Chipping Norton set’, caused turmoil at Number Ten by suggesting the Prime Minister had been too involved in a match at his country residence, Chequers, to speak to the President.

Mr Cameron flatly rejected the claims, insisting he and Mr Brooks had played tennis only once at Chequers and official logs showed no calls from Mr Obama at any time that weekend.

On the back foot: The PM playing an exhibition shot earlier this year. But did he really tell Obama to call back just so he could finish a set?

Downing Street said that officials always scheduled calls between the Prime Minister and the President in advance, with the White House giving 15 minutes’ notice even when Mr Obama woke Mr Cameron up in the middle of the night to tell him Osama Bin Laden had been assassinated.

The episode is particularly sensitive since relations between Mr Cameron and the racehorse trainer husband of former News International boss Rebekah Brooks, have been in the deep freeze since the couple were arrested and charged over the phone hacking scandal.

Racehorse trainer Charlie Brooks is an old friend of David Cameron's from their time as pupils at Eton

Mr Brooks, who was at Eton with the Prime Minister, said in an interview with the Racing Post that the pair were ‘pretty good friends’.

He went on: ‘I played tennis with him at Chequers one day. I won the first set easily, then he won the second set, and then someone came up to him and said, “Er ... Mr Obama is on the phone for you, Prime Minister”.

‘He said, “I think we’ve got time for a third set – tell Mr Obama I’ll ring him back.” He obviously thought he had me on the ropes, and I beat him two sets to one.’

Mr Brooks said that despite the hacking scandal, he hoped he would remain friends with Mr Cameron – who he said was known as the ‘fat, noisy one’ at Eton. ‘We can’t see each other now, of course, but I’m sure that will pass.’

A senior Downing Street source said: ‘We are baffled. Charlie Brooks has been to Chequers on three occasions and there are simply no calls from President Obama logged around that time.

‘It is not the case that the President rings up on the off chance that the Prime Minister is free. Calls are always scheduled by officials, even when there is an international emergency.

There is an agenda and the Prime Minister prepares for the call. There has obviously been some misunderstanding because this account cannot be true.’

Another source said the one tennis match between Mr Cameron and Mr Brooks at Chequers was on a Saturday morning in August 2010. ‘Obama would have had to be calling in the middle of the night US time.’

Mr Cameron’s links with Mr and Mrs Brooks came under scrutiny this year when it emerged that the Metropolitan Police had lent the ex-newspaper executive a retired police horse. He was forced to admit he might have ridden the horse with Mr Brooks.

Claims about David Cameron's tennis playing emerged today whole the Prime Minister was on a trade visit to Brazil. He arrived in Sao Paulo with a large entourage of 40 business men and women

Gordon Brown’s former spin doctor Damian McBride suggested aides might pretend Mr Obama was calling to give Mr Cameron an excuse to get out of a potentially boring meeting or social encounter.

‘We used to put blank post-it notes into GB. If he wanted to carry on a meeting, he’d ignore them. If not, he’d say, “Netanyahu? Now?”.’

Tony Blair’s biographer John Rentoul said he remembered Mr Blair doing something similar at a leaving party at Number Ten for his political secretary Phil Wilson, now MP for Sedgefield.

He said: ‘The Prime Minister was giving a generous speech when someone put a head round the door to say that the White House was on the line. “I’ve always wanted to do this for you, Phil,” said Blair. “Tell them I will call them back”.’
