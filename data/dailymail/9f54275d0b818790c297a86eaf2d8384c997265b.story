Usually it's the dogs that do the fetching, but that wasn't the case this weekend when emergency crews were brought in to retrieve a dog that became stranded on a cliff face in Northern California.

The black-and-whie Labrador named Oreo needed rescuing after she wandered 40 feet down a 90-foot cliff face Saturday afternoon at Portugese Beach in Sonoma County.

'It was kind of like a billy goat trail the dog went down,' Cpt Todd Rollings of the Bodega Bay Fire Protection District told the Press Democrat. 'Even the dog realized it was a dumb move.'

Helping out man's best friend: A dog named Oreo was rescued by a helicopter crew after wandering 40 feet down a 90-foot cliff face Saturday in Northern California  

Firefighters got a call about Oreo at 1:47pm and the Sonoma County Sheriff's Department was brought in to help with the rescue mission. 

Rescuers initially tried calling at the dog to come back up the hill, but scared Oreo wouldn't budge.

They also considered a rope rescue over the cliff's edge, but had a hard time maneuvering the necessary vehicles close enough to the ledge.

Eventually, they settled on using a helicopter with a sheriff's deputy attached on a 100-foot line to hover over the scene and collect Oreo.

Helicopter pilot Paul Bradley took a few low passes over the area so Oreo wouldn't be too spooked when they come in for the rescue.

Back on level land: Oreo's owner, a woman from San Pablo who drove up for the day, was relieved to be reunited with her dog

Then Deputy Henri Boustany strapped on to the end of a rope and was picked up off the ground and flown over to Oreo.

Not sure how the dog would react to a stranger wearing a flight suit and helmet, Deputy Boustany brought a towel with him to throw over the dog's head in case she decided to bite.

Luckily, there was no need since it was obvious that Oreo was more than happy to be rescued.

'The dog and I got to know each other real quick,' Boustany said. 'I think the dog just wanted to be out of there.'

Footage taken from the helicopter shows Bosutany swooping in and bear-hugging Oreo before kicking off from the face and dropping the dog off back on the level ground.

The crowd gathered to watch Oreo's rescue broke out in applause when she was handed off the firefighters, and eventually back to his relieved owner - a San Pablo woman who had driven up for the day.

'She was stoked,' Boustany said. 'She was very happy lady.'
