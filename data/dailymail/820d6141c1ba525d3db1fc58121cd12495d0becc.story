Max Verstappen, the 17-year-old prodigy, pulled out of the garage and turned into the pages of Formula One history.

To bright sunshine here in Suzuka, he become the youngest driver to take part in a grand prix weekend.

He immediately looked at ease in the Toro Rosso on the most demanding of all F1 tracks, providing evidence that he is a special talent. However, whether he will live up to his boss Helmut Marko’s lofty claim that his ability is reminiscent of Ayrton Senna remains to be seen.

Max Verstappen completed 22 laps on his Formula One debut during practice for the weekend's Japanese GP

All eyes were on the 17-year-old debutant who turned in an assured performance to post the 12th best time

He was 12th fastest in his one practice session, only half a second behind his team-mate Daniil Kvyat.

But after 22 assured laps, he had to pull off the track before the one-and-a-half hour period was completed, his contribution ending with a puff of smoke.

Verstappen said over the radio: ‘I have smoke out of the engine – what do I have to do?’ He was told: ‘Stop the car.’ 

Watching him in the garage was his father Jos, a veteran of 107 races. ‘The first lap I was a bit nervous, but now I’m calm,’ said Verstappen senior.

‘What he is doing now is more than enough. He has to drive as much as he can. I am very proud.’

Verstappen Jnr batted any questions about his age being a factor moving forward. 

'I'm not focused on the age, it doesn't matter to me,' he said.

'I think at the end, age doesn't make any difference - if you are ready for it and you have prepared well, age is just a number.

'Sebastian (Vettel) started when he was 19 and look at him now, some people can make it and some cannot.'

Verstappen, went on to suggest people could race in the sport as young as 14 - but is not looking at early comparisons between himself and four-time world champion Vettel.

'I focus on what I have to do at the moment,' he said. 'I have to prove myself in F1 but it is always nice to hear those things.'

His session may have been cut short but the Dutchman was happy with his maiden outing at a bonafide race weekend.

'I can't complain really, I enjoyed it a lot and that was the main thing today - just to get experience and make a lot of laps,' he added.

'I think in general it was more about learning the car, there is quite some difference compared to the 2012 car so I just build it up lap-by-lap and by the end you get used to it. It is always good to drive an F1 car.'

Toro Rosso team principal Franz Tost has confirmed Verstappen will compete in free practice at all of the remaining races, with the exception of the Russian Grand Prix next weekend.

'We want to run him in Austin as well as in Sao Paulo and Abu Dhabi - this is how we want to prepare him for next season,' Tost said. 'We all know that this race track is quite difficult to learn so we gave him the opportunity to go out. He is doing a good job.

'We have changed it so he has a little less front downforce and I hope that he can do as many laps as possible. 

'He has to learn the track so when he comes next year he can just go out and knows all the tricks you need to know here.'
