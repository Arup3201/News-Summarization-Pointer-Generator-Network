A seriously burned father hurled himself into an inferno in a desperate attempt to save his wife and five of his children, it emerged today.

Yelling out for his wife, Bassam Kua, 51, tried to reach them, but couldn't.

His daughters Amal, nine, and Hanin, 14, their younger brothers Yehya, two, and Mustafa, five, and also their mother Mona, 41, died in the blaze.

The family's eldest daughter Nur, 16, survived by jumping out of an upstairs window and the father escaped through the back door.

But Nur is still in a critical condition, officials said. Father Bassan is stable.

Thirty firefighters were called to 
the semi-detached property in Sonia Gardens, Neasden, north-west London during the early 
hours of yesterday morning after a blaze took hold of the ground and first 
floors.

The fire ravaged both the ground and first floors of the semi-detached house in Neasden, north-west London

A picture posted on a Facebook tribute page identifies a young girl wearing red as the 13-year-old victim Basma.

The family are believed to be Palestinian refugees who came to Britain seeking a better life. They were renting the semi-detached house.

The fire is being treated as 
unexplained, and the Metropolitan Police and London Fire Brigade have 
begun an investigation, a police spokesman said.

Matthew Gardner, Met Police borough commander, said it was 'not being treated as suspicious'.

At a press conference this afternoon, he said officers would be making 'reassuring patrols' across the area in the coming days.Â 

Neighbour Mary O'Keefe, 54, told The People: 'There was a loud woosh like a gas canister had blown up and I heard a man shouting over and over again, "My wife, my wife'.

'After that all I could hear were children crying and screaming. It was terrible.'

A neighbour, who wished to remain anonymous, said: 'I was in my room and the window was open.

'I heard a loud bang, it was literally like an explosion, almost like a bomb.

'I thought it was really strange and 
within four minutes I heard sirens and police cars and we looked out the
 window and the fire had literally reached the top within five minutes.

'We all went outside and we saw firemen looking out the window and shouting "there's people in there".'

'It was horrific, my dad says he's never seen anything like it in his whole life, honestly I was so shocked.'

Tia
 Hirani, 13, said in the immediate aftermath: 'I'm not 100 per cent sure
 if it was Basma in the fire but from here it looks like it was her 
house.

'She's one of the most caring people 
I've ever met, she helps everyone.

'I've known her for two years roughly,
 we go to Crest Academy together.

'I've known her from year seven, we've had a few falling outs but that's just what friends do.

'She's got an older sister called Noor, I think she just finished year eleven but I'm not sure.

'I'm quite scared in case it is 
actually her house, I'm just worried in case it's her house because me 
and her are quite best friends.'

Tia said she had tried calling her friend but had not been able to get through.

Another friend of Basma Kua, Lareb 
Nasar, 13, was at the scene and said: 'I got here and found out that it 
might have been her house. I'm really worried and really upset as well, 
it's a very tragic incident.'

Asked what her friend was like, Lareb
 said: 'Basma was really good at English and she loved writing, she was 
good at science as well.

It is not yet known how the fire, which left six dead, started

'She
 was always one of the smartest in our years and she was a really good 
person as well.' Both girls said they thought that the Kua family are 
originally from Palestine.

The fire brigade said the blaze was under control by 2.50am.

An
 LFB spokesman said: 'It is understood that there were six fatalities - 
it is thought that this may be three children, two teenagers and one 
adult, but we await confirmation.

'Two further people escaped from the 
house before firefighters arrived at the scene, both were injured and 
were taken to hospital by ambulance.'

An
 LAS spokeswoman said that the two injured victims, a 51-year-old man 
and 16-year-old girl, were taken to Saint Mary's Hospital in Paddington.

She said: 'We were called at 12.51am 
by the LFB to reports of a fire at Sonia Gardens.

'We sent the air 
ambulance doctor in a car, four ambulance crews and a hazardous area 
response team.

'Sadly 
four youngsters and an adult were dead at the scene.

'Our staff treated a
 five-year-old boy in cardiac arrest but despite extensive efforts they 
were unable to resuscitate him.

'We treated two further patients for burn injuries, a man, reported to be 51 and a 16-year-old female. They were both taken to St Mary's hospital as a priority.'

A Met Police spokesman said the girl was understood to be in a critical condition while the man was less serious.

He
 added that they were awaiting official confirmation of the six deaths 
and that post-mortem examinations would be scheduled in due course.

'We
 are working with the fire brigade to establish the circumstances of the
 fire but it is currently being treated as unexplained," he added.

Tragedy: Six people died in the house fire in Sonia Gardens, Neasden

Station manager Glen Gorman, who attended the scene, said: 'There's no doubt, this is an absolute tragedy.

'My thoughts, and those of my colleagues at the London Fire Brigade, are with the friends, family and loved ones of those affected at this extremely sad and difficult time.

'We are now working with the police to ensure a full and thorough investigation is carried out.'

He added: 'Crews worked extremely hard in some very, very, difficult conditions and were able to prevent fire spreading to adjoining properties and causing further injuries or even further tragedy.'
