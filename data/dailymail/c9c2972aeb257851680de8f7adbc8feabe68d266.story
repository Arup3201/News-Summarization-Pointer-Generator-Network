Air passengers could soon be offered super-fast broadband to use the internet while flying.

The service, using new satellite technology, could even be faster than most people get at home, allowing travellers to enjoy online activities such as streaming films and music.

Even if it does not reach the highest possible speeds, it would still be ten to 20 times faster than the limited internet services currently offered by a handful of airlines.

The broadcast regulator Ofcom is 
considering whether to approve use of the new technology – called Earth 
Stations on Mobile Platforms – which would also be available on trains 
and cruise ships from next year.

It could offer broadband at 50mbps 
(megabits per second) – compared with 14.7mbps for the average home 
connection – although technology experts believe 10mbps is more 
realistic.

It uses advanced receivers to pick up
signals from high-frequency satellites, even when the vehicles they are
fitted to are travelling fast. It is not known how much the service 
would cost and companies are likely to sign up to offer it only if there
is a high demand from customers.

Satellite internet does not use telephone lines or cable systems to link customers to the web but instead uses a satellite in space to transmit data.

Almost all ships have terminals in built that can send data to satellites which in turn connect to earth stations or mobile platforms on land which are connected to the internet.

Planes can use antennas placed on the craft which operate in the same way to allow people on-board to connect to the internet.

After the antennas have transmitted data to a satellite, it is then sent to the nearest earth station.

Once there, the internet request is dealt with in the same way it would be if it were on a land-based internet connection before the information is pinged back to the web user on the plane via the satellite. 

This service is already available or being trialled by different airlines but is incredibly slow.

Satellite operators now hope to launch satellites with new technology which will be placed in geostationary obit.

They operate on a different frequency to those already in use and transmit significantly more data at faster speeds.

Companies such as Inmarsat own their own earth stations so they will be able the data's entire journey from being transmitted to the satellite on to a land base and back again.

Ofcom has launched a consultation on the new technology which could be up and running by the beginning of next year.

It will then be up to individual airlines if they want to pay the satellite operator for the service so their customers can access super-fast broadband.

Current in-flight offerings are 
extremely slow. On some BA business-class flights, for example, 
passengers can send texts and receive limited data on 2G mobile 
networks. They are charged international roaming rates by their mobile 
phone carriers.

Even a broadband trial on Virgin 
Atlantic’s A330 aircraft to the US and India only offers speeds of 
around 432kbps (kilobits per second). The airline has yet to decide how 
much to charge.

Ofcom’s policy director, Charles 
Jenne, said: ‘Recent innovations in satellite technology mean that it’s 
now possible for planes, ships and trains to access the internet at 
speeds closer to what you’d expect from home broadband.

‘Ofcom is proposing to allow the use 
of this technology in the UK, which could benefit business users and 
holidaymakers who want to stay connected while travelling.’

The reason the broadband service will
be so much faster than those already on the market is because the new 
satellites work on a higher frequency than those currently in use and 
are capable of carrying more data to individual receptors placed on 
moving vehicles.

Satellite
companies hoping to offer this technology claim they can offer speeds 
of up to 50 Mega-bits per second (mbps) - a significant improvement on 
the average 430kbps broadband service currently being tested by some 
airlines.   

In comparison, the proposed 50mbps service would be more than three times the average home broadband speed of 14.7mbps.

If
Ofcom clears the way for the new broadband technology, it will be up to
satellite providers to open up the service so private companies such as
airlines can decide if they want to pay for it.

Private companies can then offer the 
super-fast broadband service to their customers. But it will be up to 
the companies how much they will charge for the high-speed access.

As the satellites will initially 
provide the broadband directly to jets, boats or trains, the technology 
will not immediately impact on individual's broadband services.

But
in theory, the satellite companies could offer their faster satellite 
broadband to homeowners as well as large corporations in the future.

Airlines have welcomed the consultation on the new technology - entitled Earth Stations on Mobile Platforms.

Companies such as Virgin Atlantic are already trialling on-board Wi-Fi to see how much demand there is from their customers.

But the current Wi-Fi available is much slower than service the new satellite technology would offer.

It
is not known how much this service will cost and companies are only 
likely to sign up to the satellite service if there is a high demand for
it from customers.

Big interest: Airlines, including Virgin Atlantic, pictured, and British Airways, have welcomed the consultation

A Virgin Atlantic spokeswoman said: 'Virgin Atlantic has noted this Ofcom consultation with interest.

'We
welcome any developments that can enhance the passenger experience and 
are always looking for new and innovative ways to do this on our 
aircraft. If these proposals become a reality we would be interested in 
looking into this further.

'However
our current focus is a WiFi trial across some of our long haul flights,
which we hope to roll out more widely next year.'

British Airways also welcomed the consultation 

British Airways inflight 
entertainment and technology manager Richard D'Cruze said: 'We are 
always interested in employing new technology to improve the service 
that we can offer our customers, and are closely monitoring developments
in the connectivity market in both the satellite and direct 
air-to-ground technology areas.

'We
are about to embark upon a year long connectivity trial using one of 
our Boeing 747's fitted with a broadband satellite system.

'Customers
travelling on our international routes will be able to access the 
internet as well as stream media content including live television 
channels to their personal devices. The trial will allow us to test 
customer demand for such services to help inform our product strategy.'

While
companies in the UK are still trialling offering internet access 
on-board their flights, American Airlines offers its passengers a day 
Wi-Fi pass on its domestic flights at a cost of up to $21.95 (around 
£14). An international duration of flight pass costs $19.

But the company does not list the speed of its Wi-Fi access on its website.

The consultation  is likely to involve some of the world's biggest satellite operators such as Inmarsat and Eutelsat.

If it proves to be a success the technology could be available as early as next year.

Immarsat hopes to launch three of these new satellites at the end of the year.

They will be placed in geostationary 
obit over the equator and, the company claims, will be able to provide 
super-fast broadband anywhere in the world.

Miranda Mills, Vice President of Aviation at Inmarsat said: 'Inmarsat’s Global Xpress (GX) will be the world's first global super-fast broadband service and it is going to revolutionise mobile connectivity on land, at sea and in the air.

'We have invested $1.2bn in GX and the first of our three spacecraft is scheduled to be launched later this year, followed by a further two satellites in 2014. 

'Based on Ka-band technology, each satellite has a combination of fixed narrow spot beams that enable us to deliver higher speeds through more compact terminals; and steerable beams so additional capacity can be directed in real-time to where it's needed.

'Through GX, airline passengers can remain connected wherever they fly. GX will enable them to connect their smartphones, tablets and laptops or any other WiFi-enabled device to the Internet and enjoy a broadband experience akin to what they have at home or in the office.'

Ofcom policy director Charles Jenne said: 'The internet has fundamentally changed the way we live our lives, with many people wanting to stay connected when they are travelling.

'This might be updating their Facebook status, sending a work email, or checking the latest news headlines.

'Ofcom has been working with its European counterparts for the past two years to create a framework to allow the introduction of new satellite technology that will significantly increase the connection speeds for these travellers.' 

He added: 'Recent innovations in satellite technology mean that it’s now possible for planes, ships and trains to access the internet at speeds closer to what you’d expect from home broadband.

'Ofcom is proposing to allow the use of this technology in the UK, which could benefit business users and holiday makers who want to stay connected while travelling.'
