Manchester City are looking to freshen up their ageing squad by signing Lazio midfielder Felipe Anderson this summer, but the Brazilian is said to be happy with his current life in Rome and not looking for a move away.

Anderson's agent claims City have sent scouts to the Stadio Olimpico to keep an eye on his client ahead of a possible bid - even though he has recently signed a new contract keeping him at Lazio until 2020.

City have struggled to keep the pace in the Barclays Premier League title race this season and are out of all three cup competitions with critics noting that their first-choice starting XI has not changed much since Roberto Mancini's spell as manager.

And according to Anderson's agent Stefano Castagna, the 21-year-old has been identified as a potential reinforcement in midfield.

Castagna told Rome radio station Radiosei: 'The rapport with the club has always been excellent and in this case our interests coincided with those of the directors.

'It was not difficult to reach an agreement for a renewal. The president and his staff deserve praise and we are very happy with the faith shown in us.

'It's a good sign that Manchester City are coming to see him, as that means he is doing very well. He has just signed a new deal and is very happy in Rome.'

Anderson has also been linked to City's local rivals Manchester United, but Castagna sees no reason for him to leave Rome even if Lazio fail to reach the Champions League. 

'I see no particular problem in keeping him, even without Champions League qualification. Playing in that tournament would be ideal, but the Europa League is good too.'

Stefano Castagna said that even if Lazio did not qualify for the Champions League, he would happily stay
