In between planning her wedding, supporting her fiance on Strictly Come Dancing and filming for her new TV projects, Michelle has managed to design and model her new collection for Lipsy.  

Michelle, 27, has been busy in the design studio curating her Spring range for the high street giant and has unveiled it in all its glory.

Speaking to MailOnline about the latest drop, she said: 'This is my fifth collection for Lipsy and it includes classic favourites of mine that I have reworked using Spring/Summer's hottest trends and colours, as well as some brand new looks I hope everyone will love just as much as I do.'

There's plenty of the flattering bodycons that Michelle loves to wear, as well as bright new colourways for the warmer months.

'This is my debut Spring collection,' she explained. 'It's such a fun time in fashion. I loved introducing new styles that are guaranteed to get you excited about the new season. I loved injecting flashes of fluro pink for the first time as well.'

Svelte: Michelle, who shows off her toned size 8 figure in the campaign shoot, says she goes through phases with the gym and loves to indulge in festive food in December (dress, £65)

While she's getting into the Spring spirit in her new campaign, Michelle is looking forward to getting glammed up for Christmas. 

'Christmas is the one time of year you can’t go wrong with a touch of sparkle,' she said of her festive style. 

'I like to go for an outfit that has sequins, glitter or some kind of embellishment. Also, I love to wrap up in an oversized knit for a more casual look.' 

Michelle says that she'll be getting together with friends and loved ones, drinking and 'eating whatever she likes' this December. 

'I love my food,' she said. 'I think everyone sticks to the mantra that it’s OK to overindulge at Christmas. If you can't in December, then when can you?'. 

Michelle, who showcases a super svelte physique in her new campaign, believes in 'everything in moderation' when it comes to diet.

'I go through phases with the gym. I always feel better for working out but I don’t make myself feel guilty if I treat myself occasionally either,' she said.

The star, who found fame on Coronation Street, has been extremely busy recently. Not only has she been in the Dominican Republic doing a photoshoot, but she's been filming for a new drama, too.

'There’s always time for fashion,' the dedicated designer said of her hectic schedule.

'I’m fortunate that it doesn’t feel like work. I always make space in my schedule to fit in design and fitting time with Lipsy to ensure that the collections are the best that they can be. 

'Even if it means jumping on a train and getting there on Sundays.'

Michelle has also been busy planning her wedding to TOWIE and Strictly star, Mark Wright.

While they are keeping the exact date of their big day under wraps, Michelle insists everything is on track. 

As well as getting married, Michelle has clearly got big plans careerwise for 2015.

She teased: 'I’ve always been interested in fashion so when I got the chance to launch my own collection I jumped at the opportunity. 

'It’s definitely something I’d like to continue to pursue in the future. However, there are a number of new challenges which will also be taking place next year.'
