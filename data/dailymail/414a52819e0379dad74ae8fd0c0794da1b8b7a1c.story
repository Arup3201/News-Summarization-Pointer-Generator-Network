Linebacker: Andrew Sweat, a standout at Ohio State University, says he won't play in the NFL

A college football standout is causing a fan frenzy after deciding that he would rather hit the books than opposing players.

Andrew Sweat, a talented linebacker at Ohio State University, was brimming with excitement when he was offered a free-agent deal with the Cleveland Browns last month, but has since changed his mind.

Sweat, 23, announced that he is now declining the offer, saying that he cares more about his own well-being than a career in the gridiron.

He took to Twitter on Monday morning, telling his followers: 'Concussion symptoms didn't want to risk it.. Thanks to the Browns for the opportunity. Health trumps football any day'.

Instead, Sweat will enroll in law school - and he's got five to choose from, The Columbus Dispatch reported.

While many football fans praised Sweat for his decision and offered their support, others could not help but shake a finger at the young athlete.

Among them was Elie Mystal, an editor at AbovetheLaw.com, who wrote in a blog post that Sweat was making ‘the biggest mistake of his life.'

Mystal also drew comparisons between a lawyer drowning in student loan debt to a rookie football player making at least $390,000 a year.

With the shocking suicide of former NFL superstar Junior Seau earlier this month, and revelations of a brutal New Orleans Saints 'crush for cash' bounty program, debates have erupted about the brutality of football.

More than 100 NFL players have donated their brains to research in the hope that scientists can explain head trauma from their playing days.

At just 31 years old, St Louis Rams offensive guard Jacob Bell made the decision to retire from the sport days after Seau's death.

Speaking to StlToday.com two weeks ago, Bell said: 'I don't want to be at the point where I'm jeopardizing my true health for money pretty much - for money and for celebrity.'

Likewise, health is a major concern for Sweat, who was sidelined for most of last season with a concussion and an injured elbow.

He told the Cleveland Plain Dealer last month: 'I was hurt my whole senior year… I'll let my actions speak for themselves and go out and play.'

Sweat graduates from Ohio State on June 1.
