A Dutch artist has produced an stunningly lifelike piece of 3D street art to highlight the plight of endangered African and Asian elephants.

Remko Van Shaik, 45, chose the pavement outside a Buddhist temple in Bangkok, Thailand, on which to showcase his stunning chalk work to coincide with the meeting in the city of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.

According to a new report entitled 'Elephants in the Dust – The African Elephant Crisis' presented to the summit, increasing poaching levels, as well as loss of habitat, are threatening the survival of African elephant populations in Central Africa as well as previously secure populations in West, Southern and Eastern Africa.

The report says systematic monitoring of large-scale seizures of ivory destined for Asia is indicative of the involvement of criminal networks, which are increasingly active and entrenched in the trafficking of ivory between Africa and Asia.

The forest elephants of Africa have lost almost two-thirds of their number in the past decade due to poaching for ivory, a landmark new study revealed on Tuesday.

Eight key ivory-trading nations, including the host nation Thailand and biggest market China, have been put on notice of sweeping trade sanctions if they fail to crack down on the trade.

'The analysis confirms what conservationists have feared: the rapid trend towards extinction – potentially within the next decade – of the forest elephant,' said Samantha Strindberg of the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), one of 60 scientists on the research team.

There are about 100,000 forest elephants remaining in the forests of central Africa, compared with about 400,000 of the slightly larger savannah elephants. The total elephant population was over 1m 30 years ago, but has been devastated by poaching driven by the rising demand for ivory ornaments in Asia.

Mr Van Shaik, who collaborates with Planet Street Painting, has displayed his pieces in Europe and the America.
