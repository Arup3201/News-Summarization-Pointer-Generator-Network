Hashim Hanif Ibn Abdul-Rasheed, 41, of Columbus, was shot dead at an Ohio airport after lunging at a cop with a knife

A bomb squad found containers of frozen urine in the vehicle of man who police said lunged at an airport officer with a knife and was fatally shot.

The suspicious material was confirmed as urine after the confrontation on Wednesday at Port Columbus International Airport, said the local police union leader, Jason Pappas. It's not clear why the man had the containers.

Investigators said he had tried unsuccessfully to buy an airline ticket using a woman's ID, then got into the fatal confrontation with airport police after returning to his illegally parked vehicle.

Police identified the man as 41-year-old Hashim Hanif Ibn Abdul-Rasheed, of Columbus. No one answered the door on Thursday at a Hillard address listed for him.

Police were investigating the man's background and why he was using a woman's ID.

After the first shots were fired, he got up and headed back toward the terminal, and a second airport officer shot him, Columbus police Sgt. Rich Weiner said. He was shot multiple times.

Pappas said three officers were involved in the confrontation. 

He said two uniformed airport officers approached the man, and one struggled with him and fired before retreating, at which point a detective came out of the airport and fired at the attacker.

Abdul-Rasheed had multiple knives on him, police said. 

The first officer who fired suffered scrapes and bruises, but the police weren't seriously hurt, Pappas said.

The officers will be on administrative leave for at least two days and will have counseling with a police psychologist, per standard procedure, he said.

Columbus city police are handling the investigation. They have not released surveillance video that is expected to show what happened.

Court records in Cuyahoga County show Abdul-Rasheed was indicted in Cleveland in 1999 on charges including attempted murder, aggravated burglary and aggravated robbery - all with firearms specifications.

The court determined he was mentally ill subject to involuntary hospitalization and found him not guilty by reason of insanity in June 2000. 

He was committed to the maximum security unit of a psychiatric facility in Dayton.

He remained under court supervision for more than a decade, transitioning to a different behavioral health care facility, then a group home with full-time supervision in 2002, semi-supervised housing and eventually independent living. His commitment ended in December 2012, and the case was closed.

County records indicate the same defendant had been convicted of attempted felonious assault in 1995 under a plea deal. 

His five-to-10 year prison sentence was suspended, and he was put on probation and sentenced to community service and counseling.

Online court records don't indicate details of the crimes, and calls seeking more information from a division of the court clerk's office rang unanswered Thursday.

Neighbors at Abdul-Rasheed's apartment complex in suburban Columbus said they saw a man outside his apartment two nights ago screaming and pounding on the door. The man fit Abdul-Rasheed's description, but they couldn't say if it was him.

'He was just screaming, ''Why? Why?''' Tim Butts, whose apartment is across the parking lot, said Thursday.

Butts, a technology manager in the Columbus area, said at first he thought the man was joking around.

'It went on and on for about 10 minutes,' Butts said. 'He was just outside the apartment there, banging on the door a couple times, then starts screaming, looking everywhere with his hands in the air.'
