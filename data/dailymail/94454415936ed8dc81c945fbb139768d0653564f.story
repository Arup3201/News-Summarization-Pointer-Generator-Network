Ben Davies is the young Swansea defender being chased by Liverpool and Tottenham. Reds boss Brendan Rodgers has had an £8million bid rejected with the Swans holding out for £12m.

Sportsmail takes a closer peek at the player whose career path is very much on the up.

Who is he and what position does he play?

Davies was born on the April 24, 1993 and is a Welsh left back who came through Swansea City’s youth system to become a regular first-team starter.

Exciting prospect: Ben Davies has already played 84 times for Swansea despite only turning 21 in April

No nonsense: Davies is a tough tackler as well as providing an attacking threat from left back

What’s all the fuss about, then?

Davies, 21, is best known amongst the Swansea fans for his consistency. They could count the mistakes he’s made on one hand and, in playing 43 games for them last season, he showed no signs of burnout. He is calm and composed on the ball and a threat going forward.

So he’s another Luke Shaw?

He’s very similar. Davies, like Shaw, came through the ranks at his first club to become a regular starter and has international experience with Wales as well.

Davies is an attacking full back, too, but has scored three goals while Shaw is yet to register a senior strike. Davies' passing accuracy is much better than Shaw's at 83 per cent compared with 70 per cent.

He has the ability to become a centre back later in his career, according to former Swansea manager Michael Laudrup.

Shaw thing: Davies has been compared to England and Manchester United left back Luke Shaw

Goal threat: Davies nets against West Brom in the Premier League back in September 2013

Swansea want £12m for him. Is he worth it?

If Shaw is worth £30m, then why not? He’s experienced for his age and has played in Europe seven times. Davies can also boast League Cup success in 2013... what a bargain!

Is he leaving?

Possibly. He’s a Swansea fan, so he obviously has emotional ties to the club and Garry Monk seems reluctant to let him go, but if his price tag is met we could see him in Liverpool colours by September.

Do Liverpool even need another left back?

Yes, desperately. With only Jose Enrique and Jon Flanagan at their disposal to play there Liverpool have no time to lose this summer. They have also expressed interest in Sevilla's Alberto Moreno and Ajax's Daley Blind, but Davies would be an important addition to Brendan Rodgers' squad.
