Final steps: Kellie Maloney, pictured yesterday, will undergo breast and genitalia surgery in January

Kellie Maloney, formerly known as boxing promoter Frank Maloney, was this week told that doctors plan to carry out the operations that will complete her transformation from a man to a woman early next year.

Maloney, who has three daughters from two marriages, is now 18 months into the transition period - learning to live as a different gender.

And she revealed today that she has just one final consultation with doctors before her final operation is booked for January 13.

The mother-of-three was with her eldest daughter Emma, 32, when she found out on Wednesday that doctors had the date set aside for her genital and breast surgery.

Under NHS guidelines, transsexuals have to live as a woman for two years before they are allowed corrective surgery. Private clinics recommend one year to ensure that their patients can cope with the change.

Kellie has already received hormone therapy, hours of hair removal electrolysis, voice coaching and counselling.

She will now have an operation that will involve 'the realignment of her male genitalia to become female genitalia' as well as having breast implants - which doctors said could be up to a B or a C cup. 

The procedures will leave Kellie bed-bound for 10 days and require a further 12-week recovery period. 

But the 60-year-old insists that she is not nervous about undergoing the painful procedures, saying that it is something she has 'always wanted'.

She told the Daily Mirror: 'As soon as I get out of that bed, I'm going to look in a full-length mirror at myself and for the first time ever, I will see the person I should have been all my life staring back at me'.

She added: 'When I was born, the midwife just got me wrong. If you're born without an arm or a leg, you can have it medically corrected. I was born with the wrong body to match my brain.' 

The January surgery, which Kellie has chosen to have done at a private clinic, will come after more plastic surgery to her face next month. 

Sharing her plans yesterday on Lorraine, Kellie revealed that she's having an operation in Belgium to have her nose made slightly smaller.

She said: 'My youngest daughter told me my nostrils were too big.

'I was always concerned about my chin but they tell me it's within the female parameters and the gender doctor can do the full operation, hopefully, and breasts in January.' 

Kellie, who has been married twice, shocked the sports world - and her family - when she announced that she had embarked on a new life as a woman. 

But the news, as well as her appearance on Celebrity Big Brother, led to greater understanding from her estranged daughters - so much so, that they now want her back in their lives on a daily basis after a two-year rift.

However Kellie said that she wanted to be alone for the moment that she sees her new body for the first time. 

She added: 'I want that moment to be personal and private'.  

The former boxing manager, who guided Lennox Lewis to the world heavyweight title, retired in October – claiming she had fallen out of love with the sport. 

But yesterday even revealed that she's toying with the idea of getting back into boxing to prove that women can do it too.
