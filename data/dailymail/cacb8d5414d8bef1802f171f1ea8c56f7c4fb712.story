Cardiff City are showing an interest in Hamburg defender Muhamed Besic.

Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wants a replacement for Steven Caulker who is attracting interest from Arsenal, Swansea, Southampton and Liverpool.

Berlin-born Besic, 21, is a member of Bosnia's World Cup squad and can also play in midfield.

Cardiff have been busy since being relegated from the Premier League with the signings of strikers Javi Guerra, Federico Macheda and Adam Le Fondre and midfielder Guido Burgstaller already completed.

In an interview with BBC Radio Wales, chairman Mehmet Dalman said that defence and midfield were now the club's priority in the transfer market and hinted that another signing could be completed soon.

'I wouldn't be surprised if we had another one announced by the end of this week,' he said.

'One of the criticisms we had last year was the fact we didn't have enough firepower upfront.

'I think we rectified that with the latest signings and obviously what we want to do now is pay attention to the midfield and the defence.

'That's where I think we'll be focusing our efforts in the next couple of months.'

Swansea, meanwhile, are monitoring Atalanta playmaker Luca Cigarini, 27.
