Philip Green has vowed to undercut Tesco with his new company BHS Food. BHS Food will be launched in Staines and Warrington

The British retail baron behind Topshop and BHS has entered the supermarket price war by vowing to undercut Tesco.

Sir Philip Green said BHS Food, which is about to be tested in two stores with plans to open in more than 140, will be 10 per cent cheaper than the UK’s largest grocers when it launches.

The big four supermarkets, which also include Morrisons, Asda and Sainsbury’s, are poised for a price slashing drive to take on discount rivals Aldi and Lidl.

This was sparked by Morrisons, which earlier this month vowed to spend £1billion lowering the price of many basic foods after losing ground to the smaller cut-price competitors.

The move led Asda to pledge a similar sum towards cutting price tags.

BHS, which is loss-making and has struggled in recent years against rivals such as Debenhams and Marks & Spencer, announced plans to start selling food at the end of last year.

But over the weekend the billionaire retailer behind the group said he would slash food prices to become more competitive than major established supermarkets.

‘We know what we’re getting into - the most competitive food landscape for some time,’ said Sir Philip.

‘There’s no point opening up and getting torn apart because we haven’t got competitive prices.’

The group has planned to cash in on the growing demand for convenience stores, which are the most thriving area of the High Street.

Around 10 per cent of a large BHS store could be devoted to food halls, Green has said.

The trials, in BHS stores in Staines and Warrington, are due to begin imminently and will see branded products such as bread, cakes, fizzy drinks and some frozen items.

It is thought that he plans to sell these at parity with some supermarkets, but lower than others.

For example a two litre bottle of Pepsi would be sold for £1 - the same as Asda but almost half the price of Morrisons and Sainsbury’s.

A 170g jar of Bisto gravy granules would be sold for £1, which is in line with Morrisons but cheaper than Tesco, Asda or Saisnbury’s.

He added: ‘On the basis that everyone is going into the high street and convenience maybe it’s an opportunity.

‘If you don’t buy a ticket you can’t win the lottery.’

He hopes the venture will turn around the fortunes of the chain, which last year posted a pre-tax loss of £71 million.

Although industry analysts are sceptical of the potential for BHS to make a major dent in the market on its own, it is thought the foray into food might tempt one of the larger players to enter into a deal with Sir Philip.

With a network of 180 stores across the UK, a tie-up with the tycoon would give any large supermarket instant access to a wide range of locations, analysts say.

But if the venture fail he could be forced to sell the chain.

Aldi and Lidl, both German companies, have thrived in the downturn as families look for ways to cut their weekly shopping bills.

They have been the fastest growing of all the supermarkets, according to industry data.Now it is thoughts that everyday items could fall by a quarter as the established grocers try to catch up.
