A woman has participated in a nude photo shoot after getting out of an unfaithful, tumultuous marriage, conquering a debilitating illness, and losing a hundred pounds.

Stephanie Athena-Marie, 29, of Crestone, Colorado, allowed  photographer Beth Sanders to shoot her as part of journalist Shannon Bradley-Colleary's Love Your Body Now: Healing Body Image Issues Through Fine Art Nudes series. She also received life-coach services from Marlene Zaleznick as part of the project. Ms Athena-Marie credits her miraculous weight loss to a 'return to emotional health' she experienced after moving to Colorado to 'be closer to nature' following her divorce.

Full of joy! Following her divorce, Ms Athena-Marie moved to Colorado, where she lost 100 pounds without even altering her exercise and diet. She attributes the loss to her 'return to emotional health'

Not ashamed! Ms Athena-Marie said she decided to pose nude 'to show myself that my physical body didn't have to be an obstacle to me living a life I love'

For years, Ms Athena-Marie was ravaged by the effects of Hidradenitis Suppurativa (or 'HS'), a non-contagious illness that causes size-able, painful lumps to form under the skin. The lumps frequently result in lesions and scarring, making her decision to bare it all that much more significant. 

Her HS is worsened by stress - and was exacerbated during her year and a half long marriage to her ex-husband, who occasionally wouldn't want to touch her because of her illness.

'HS people who aren't already in relationships find it difficult to begin new relationships because of what other people will think,' she said. 

She found out he was cheating on her - and when she went to file divorce papers, she discovered he had filed separation papers a year earlier.

'I could either drink and whore myself out for the rest of my life or I could get up, get angry, cry and figure out why this happened,' she said. 

She opted for the latter and moved to Colorado, to 'be closer to nature.' 

Proud! Since her early twenties, Ms Athena-Marie has suffered from Hidradenitis Suppurativa - a disease that caused the scars visible under her arms and on her breasts 

Grin and bare it! The subject was nervous at first for her shoot, but felt at ease after the first few shots 

Nesting! Ms Athena-Marie wasn't embarrassed about her scars being visible in the shots and said 'You can either fight it or welcome it. Either way, it is there'

In Colorado, as she healed, she miraculously lost a hundred pounds - without altering her diet or exercise routines.

At the same time, her HS flare-ups decreased to the point of almost disappearing entirely.

'Healthy/balanced feeding of my physical body as well as my mental, emotional and spiritual self is the key for my whole-body health and my relationship with HS,' she told MailOnline. 

Now, years later, Ms Athena-Marie is happy with her life -  and considers her decision to pose for nude photographs an expression of her 'blossoming.'

Taking a deep breath! Ms Athena-Marie loved 'being naked outdoors' and said she 'felt honored to share my body with the elements in such a natural way' 

Although she was nervous at first during the shoot, Ms Sanders quickly put her at ease.

'I loved being naked outdoors. It was such a beautiful sunny day - and yes I was so sunburnt afterwards,' she said. 'I have a deep connection with land, animals, trees and water so I felt honored to share my body with the elements in such a natural way.'

After the pair had taken a few pictures, Ms Athena-Marie began suggesting different shots and 'asking to lay in the flowers or stand in the creek.' 

Her scars were but a passing thought - and she wasn't worried about them being visible in the photos. 

'I have lived with those scars for many years now that I don't remember any different,' she said. 'When your body changes you can either fight it or welcome it. Either way, it won't change the fact that it is there.'

Inner peace! Now that Ms Athena-Marie has 'returned to emotional health' her HS flare-ups are few and far between

A transformative experience! 'There is much more to us than just this body,' Ms Athena-Marie said. 'When we all realize this, we can begin to get to the real depth in our lives and connections.' 

Now that the photos are published for the world to see, Ms Athena-Marie doesn't regret taking part in the project - and has learned a lot about herself from the experience. 

'The main reason I chose to participate in the project was to show myself that my physical body didn't have to be an obstacle to me living a life I love,' Ms Athena-Marie said. 'So many people, men and women, are afraid of their bodies. They put living on hold because of their fears and judgements.If more people would do what they want to do, what inspires and heals them, we would all see a world much different than the one we see now.'

'There is much more to us than just this body. When we all realize this, we can begin to get to the real depth in our lives and connections, and move on from the surface.'
