A mother taking pictures of her children playing in the garden unwittingly snapped an amazing cloud formation shaped exactly like the British Isles.

Hollie Lindley, 29, had just returned to her home in Leeds, West Yorkshire from shopping on Sunday afternoon after a day of unpredictable weather.

She started taking pictures of her two children playing in the garden when she noticed a cloud in the background shaped exactly like the UK set against a clear blue sky.

And after her husband agreed that he too saw the similarity, she took another snap of the formation just to make sure.

The sales customer co-ordinator said: 'I don't go out looking forÂ  things to photograph, but I just happened to see it when I took a photo of my children.

'We had just come home from food shopping, the usual for a Sunday afternoon, and the children were in the garden playing.

'The weather has been on and off recently. We've had sun, rain and hail, a bit of everything really, so it was nice to get some blue sky.

In 2009  teenager Jessica Wild while walking home from school captured a cloud shaped like Great Britain over Droitwich

'The cloud looked exactly like Britain. I told my husband to have a look and he saw it too, so I took another picture of just the cloud.'

The image is similar to another snapped in 2009 by teenageer Jessica Wild while walking home from school, showing a cloud shaped like Great Britain over Droitwich.

The unpredictable weather of showers followed by blue skies and sunshine sometimes brings with it unusual cloud formations.

A cloud shaped like a duck, left and another in the shape of an elephant, right have also been spotted above the UK recently

Earlier this month, an amazing duck-shaped culumus cloud was spotted in the skies above York by by York University student Ben Hopkins, 21, as he walked through the city's Rowntree Park.

The History and Politics student said: 'I was pretty surprised when I looked up and saw it.

'In films you see clouds looking like things but you don't expect to see it in real life.'

And last autumn, retired GP Margaret Worrall spotted a cloud shaped just like an elephant as she walked her dogs along the banks of the River Forth in Scotland.

Cumulus clouds are a type of low-level cloud known for their puffy shapes and clearly-defined edges.
