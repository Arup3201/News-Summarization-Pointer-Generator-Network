Prolific abuser: Simon Wood at a fundraising event in a BA uniform

Victims of a paedophile British Airways pilot claim that a colleague at the airline helped him to abuse vulnerable children in at least three countries in Africa.

They say Simon Wood was helped and protected by a network of associates, including a male airline colleague, another British man and a female manager at one of Nairobi’s orphanages.

The trio are not believed to have been directly involved in sexual abuse against children, but lawyers are probing claims they helped the 54-year-old, who killed himself last month, to access his victims and to cover up his crimes.

Up to 50 alleged victims of First Officer Wood are now considering legal action against BA over the paedophile pilot’s crimes, details of which were revealed in yesterday’s Daily Mail.

They say they were molested by the £100,000-a-year pilot during his stopovers and charity work in Kenya.

It is feared Wood – now suspected of abusing hundreds of orphans and slum children in Kenya – also targeted youngsters in Uganda and Tanzania.

The suggestion that Wood was aided by a colleague will be of enormous concern to BA.

Martyn Day, a partner at UK law firm Leigh Day, said it was in contact with 40 to 50 families who believed their young daughters were molested by Wood.

Twelve have so far given interviews to lawyers about their ordeal and some have named a second British Airways employee and another British man.

Mr Day said his firm was working with British police to investigate the claims, and was considering launching legal action on their behalf against Wood’s estate and BA.

He said: ‘One man we are looking  at is a British Airways staff employee and there’s another who is British but not a BA employee.

‘There are allegations they were involved in some way in facilitating Wood’s activities, but not in the abuse itself.

‘There is a big question about British Airways and the extent to which they had a vicarious responsibility.’

Scotland Yard declined to comment on claims a second BA employee helped Wood.

Officials at the Tulia Kidzone orphanage in Nairobi say one of their managers was dismissed in January this year after she was found to have allowed Wood access to vulnerable children.

In return, it is claimed the BA pilot bought her a car, helped her to get a mortgage and enrolled her own child in a charity ‘sponsorship’ programme.

Accountants were called into the orphanage earlier this year and were said to have uncovered a ‘myriad of financial issues’ in Wood’s handling of charitable donations to the centre.

Managers said it was still unclear whether Wood used his own money to pay off his network of associates.

They contacted Leigh Day earlier this year to beg them to investigate, after official complaints about Wood in Kenya appeared to have stalled.

Wood, who claimed he was carrying out charity work for BA, was stopped only after he was charged over separate child sex offences in the UK last month.

The pilot threw himself under a train near his home in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, last month, just days after appearing in a court in London accused of the offences.

Wood first came to the attention of British police when he was accused of an indecent assault on an eight-year-old girl. He met her while volunteering for Diabetes UK at a summer camp in North Yorkshire in 2000.

Wood was investigated over the sex attack the following year, but the Crown Prosecution Service ruled there was insufficient evidence to charge him. He then stepped up his charity work overseas.

Wangui Mbatia, from the children’s rights group Organising For Kenya, revealed someone had sent an anonymous note to BA earlier this year, telling them Wood had molested children in Kenya.

Three BA officials visited a children’s centre in July to discuss the claims. ‘They wanted us to understand that BA wasn’t involved,’ she said.

‘BA came to tell us they had nothing to do with it but we think they had everything to do with it. Now BA are missing in action.

‘We told them a pilot had gone bad and they told us to be quiet. They should be here to help us.’ BA insists it has never tried to cover up the scandal.

Asked about claims a second BA employee might have helped Wood, the airline said last night: ‘We continue to give the Met our fullest cooperation on this investigation.’

In a statement, the CPS said there was originally ‘insufficient evidence’ to charge Wood over the sex attack in North Yorkshire.

But new evidence prompted them to authorise police to charge him over the allegation and child porn offences last month.

A Diabetes UK spokesman said they were continuing to support police inquiries, adding: ‘Our thoughts are with all those affected and we have offered our support to the family of the complainant.’

Wood’s mother Christine, 77, refused to comment at her home in Cumbria yesterday.

The freephone NSPCC helpline 0808 800 5000 is available for anyone to report a concern or seek advice relating to this incident.  Where appropriate the charity will work with the Metropolitan Police.  Calls can be made anonymously.
