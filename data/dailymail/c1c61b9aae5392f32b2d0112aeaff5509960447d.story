Two great white sharks were caught on video lurking in the waters off the coast of a resort town in Cape Cod.

Scott Koerner, who works at the Marine Biological Laboratory, was on the water in Chatham Saturday when the dorsal fins of two sharks appeared.

As Koerner films, the sharks thrash their tails in the shallow water before slipping back beneath the surface of the water.

Lurking: Two great whites were caught on video swimming in the shallow waters off the coast of Cape Cod on Sunday

Though their numbers were once on the decline in New England, great whites are no longer as exotic as they once were.

Earlier this year, scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration published a study in PLOS ONE saying that the great white population had rebounded from low numbers.

The recovery could be seen beginning in 2000, spurred by conservation laws like a 1997 ban on the fishing of the shark, which can grow up to 5,000 pounds.

The sharks were also helped by a growing abundance of prey, and one of the sharks' favored meals, the grey seal, makes its home off the coast of Cape Cod.

Great whites tend to be elusive, but there have been times the shark has come too close for comfort to humans.

According to National Geographic, of the 100 or more shark attacks every year, between a third and a half can be blamed on great whites.

Boston Magazine reports that a great white upended two kayakers in Cape Cod in September, taking a bite out of one of the boats but leaving the paddlers unharmed.

There's no fear in Koerner's video and the boaters are elated to get to see two specimens of the elusive species.

'Double shark!' yells someone in the background of the video.
