A bungling car thief died when he crashed a high-powered classic sports car into a tree - just 100ft from the garage he stole it from.

The crook and an accomplice broke into the property and were attempting a getaway when the black 1964 Mercedes-Benz 230 SL - worth £70,000 - smashed into a tree seconds after fleeing the property in Osielsko, north Poland.

The dead burglar's accomplice drove off with a 1959 Mercedes-Benz 190SL - worth about £50,000.

 The classic sports car, worth about £70,000 was severely damaged in the crash which killed the crook

 A man walking his dog near the crash ran over to help and found the car thief slumped over the steering wheel

A man who was walking his dog nearby at the time said: 'I saw the car crash and ran over to see if I could help.

'The other car had driven off and when I looked inside the crashed car I saw a man slumped over the steering wheel wearing a balaclava and gloves.

'He was dead. I guess God was watching and decided to punish him.'

The owner of the two Mercedes-Benz classic cars, Maciej Borkowski, thought the thief may have crashed because he was used to cars with power steering. 

He said: 'These are powerful old cars and they don't drive and steer like modern ones. You need to know what you're doing.'

A police spokesman said: 'We are trying to identify the driver which is proving difficult as we have no record of him in our files and no one has come forward to claim the body.

'He is a bit of a mystery.'

But one local added: 'The bigger mystery is how his accomplice is going to sell the car now, as everyone will know it was stolen and that someone died in the other one.'

The 'mystery' thief may have crashed the black vehicle because he was not used to driving classic cars

Polish police are still hunting the dead man's accomplice, who got away with a 1959 Mercedes-Benz 190SL
