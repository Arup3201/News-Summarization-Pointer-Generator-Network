A pre-op male transsexual has been sent to one of Britain's most notorious all-female prisons after robbing a man and attacking three police officers.

Katelyn Findlay, 18, who was born Stuart Kelly, is being held at Cornton Vale prison near Stirling, which in recent years was officially Scotland's most violent jail.

Findlay was sent to the female-only institution
 because she has been actively living as a woman - but has not physically started the sex change process.

Controversial: Katelyn Kelly, who was born Stuart Kelly, has been sent to an all-female prison after she has admitted robbing a man and assaulting police

Jail: Cornton Vale women's prison in Stirling, which became notorious for violence in Scotland

Two years ago it was revealed Cornton Vale had more fights and assaults per prisoner than any male jail north of the border.

The teenager, of Airdrie, Lanarkshire, was born male but has been dressing as a woman for at least two years and is hoping to have a sex-change operation.

She was sentenced to six months in prison at Airdrie Sheriff Court after already having spent a month at the prison on remand.

Her solicitor Robin White told the court she had experienced a 'difficult' time in the jail because she was a transsexual and was desperate not to go back there.

But the court refused to the request because of the seriousness of her crime.

Trouble: The pre-op transsexual has been held on remand in the same prison but has had a 'difficult tine', her legal team said

Life: Katelyn has not officially started the sex change process, however, she has been dressing as a woman for two years

'This is her first time in custody and it's an experience which has not been particularly good for her,' Mr White said.

'She has had a very difficult time in Cornton Vale given her present circumstances and it's not a situation she wants to find herself in again.

'Her lifestyle has been extremely chaotic and she has suffered difficulties in her social life.

'She does not want to go back to Cornton Vale.'

However, Sheriff Dickson said there was no alternative to custody as Findlay had been an 'active participant' in a robbery.

She admitted robbing David Aitken of house keys and a mobile phone sim card at an address in Airdrie on April 12.

She also admitted resisting arrest and shouting, swearing, spitting at and violently struggling with three police constables on the same date.

Sitting in the dock, Findlay wore no make up and had her hair tied in a bun.

A prison source said: 'She is being held at Cornton Vale because she insists she is a woman.

'However she is actually still a man and it has caused quite a stir.

'Staff are having to refer to her as Katelyn and she is being recognised as a female.'

Findlay's Facebook page is littered with suggestive comments from men and she refers to herself as a single female.

She has uploaded over 300 pictures of herself posing as a woman and posted that she 'needed a boyfriend.'

Colin MacFarlane, director of Stonewall Scotland, who campaign for transgender equality, said: 'We would expect Cornton Vale prison to act very sensitively with this issue.

'A person who is transsexual does not need to have any surgery to obtain a gender recognition certificate and be recognised legally in their acquired gender.'

A Scottish Prison Service spokesman said: 'We cannot comment on individual inmates.

'The Scottish Prison Service has established policies in place for such occasions.'
