A Brooklyn who sent $67,000 to al-Qaida and pledged his support to the terror group has been sentenced to 15 years in prison.

Wesam el-Hanafi, who was born in New York, has admitted to providing technical supplies, including encryption devices and surveillance cameras, along with tens of thousands in cash to terrorist leaders in Yemen.

He and an accomplice also cased the New York Stock Exchange for a possible attack from operatives working for al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). 

Wesam el-Hanafi 'turned his back on his country' when handed over tens of thousands of dollars and technical equipment to al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula

'He was living the American dream. Then he turned his back on his country and pledged allegiance to our greatest enemies,' Manhattan Assistant US Attorney John Cronan said. 

'The defendant was all in with al-Qaeda.' 

Federal Judge Kimba Wood in Manhattan sentenced Brooklyn-born Wesam El-Hanafi  on Tuesday. The sentence was less than the 20-year maximum term prosecutors had sought, and three years less than his co-defendant received.

He received leniency because he suffers from deep-vein thrombosis, a condition that creates blood clots in his legs that can be painful and even cause death.  

El-Hanafi pleaded guilty in June 2012, two years after he was brought to the United States from Dubai.

Prosecutors say El-Hanafi pledged loyalty to al-Qaida and sought to teach the group how to evade detection on the Internet. He went to Yemen in 2008 and met with al-Qaida representatives.

El-Hanafi said he regrets his actions and is embarrassed.
