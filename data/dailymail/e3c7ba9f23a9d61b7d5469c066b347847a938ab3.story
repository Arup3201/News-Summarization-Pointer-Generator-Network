Perhaps it was a game of fetch, the promise of a walk or a rummage in the kitchen bin.

But these dogs have not been able to contain their excitement – grinning from ear to ear after their elation became too much to keep a straight face.

They were among hundreds of animals competing to be named Britain's smiliest pet.

A 10-year-old Staffordshire Bull Terrier called Harvey was handed the top prize.

Proud owner April Gargiulo said: 'We're so excited that Harvey has won this prize and is getting some recognition for how amazing and happy he is - he really deserves it.

'Even though he's getting on a bit at the grand old age of 10, Harvey still runs around like a puppy and is in amazing shape for his age.'

April, from Horley, Surrey, was happy to reveal the secret behind Harvey's happy smile.

She said: 'He is a 'fetch' fanatic and will keep going for hours if given the opportunity.

'He enjoys long walks and is also a fantastic swimmer, regularly fetching sticks from our local doggie-dip pond.

'We feed him a varied diet of quality dog food and fruit and veg to keep him happy and healthy.'
