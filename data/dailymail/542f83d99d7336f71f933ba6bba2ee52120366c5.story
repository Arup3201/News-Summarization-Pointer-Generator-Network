President Barack Obama and the first family have lit the national Christmas tree. 

And this time, his daughters Sasha and Malia remembered to smile.

Flanking their father, their mother Michelle, and their maternal grandmother Marian Robinson, the teenagers beamed as they clustered around the light switch just feet away from the White House.

Joyful joyful! The entire first family looked full of Christmas spirit at the annual tree-lighting ceremony

The big moment: Malia, 16, beamed out at the crowds and Sasha, 13, stared excitedly at the light-switch as their father told citizens to remember those on military service when they look at the tree, a symbol of hope

Not so spritely: The first daughters' sullen expressions on Thanksgiving prompted a wave of reaction

It was a welcome change after the pair appeared less than festive at the annual turkey pardon for Thanksgiving, which prompted former Republican communications officer Elizabeth Lauten to call them 'classless'. 

Her controversial comments sparked outrage and Lauten's subsequent resignation.

There was no sign of sullenness on Thursday night's event though - both girls, wrapped up warm in J Crew coats, were seen smiling and giggling. 

Michelle read from The Night Before Christmas at the event hosted by Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson, while the major musical performances came from singers Patti LaBelle and Steve Miller

In his address, Obama said the national tree is a 'symbol of hope and holiday spirit.' 

He urged Americans to remember members of the U.S. military serving overseas, as well as their families. 

Glittering: The ceremony was the 92nd to be held outside the White House, with crowds gathered to watch

Joking around: The scene was a change in tone from Malia and Sasha's somber attitude on Thanksgiving

The moment: The girls, both wrapped up warm in J Crew coats, pushed the button together to turn on the glittering red, white and green light display

Hundreds gathered to watch the 47-foot tree light up before speeches and festive story-telling

Support: The Obama girls were accused of failing to show their father support on Thanksgiving but their jovial attitude on Thursday night, walking arm-in-arm with their father, sent a clear message to their critics

'As we hold our loved ones tight, let's remember the military families whose loved ones are far from home,' Obama said. 'They are our heroes.' 

There followed performances from artists including singer NE-YO, pop performers Nico & Vinz, singing group The Tenors, and country singer Chely Wright.

This year's ceremony marks the 92nd annual lighting of the Christmas tree just steps from the White House. 

The tradition was started by President Calvin Coolidge in 1923, according to the National Parks Service.

A festive kiss: Tom Hanks planted a kiss on Michelle Obama's cheek as they celebrated the annual event

Nativity fun: Michelle and Mo'ne Davis looked animated as they read from The Night Before Christmas

Success! She high-fived her fellow performer, the famed 13-year-old baseball player, when they finished
