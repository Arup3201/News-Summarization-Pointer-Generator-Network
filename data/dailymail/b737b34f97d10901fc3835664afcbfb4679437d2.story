In the five seconds it has taken you to read this sentence, Samsung has earned a staggering $32,430.

This converts to £20,200 and is what the average university graduate in the UK earns in a year.

To highlight the obscene amounts of money the world’s major tech companies earn, a money-saving website has created an interactive infographic that shows exactly how much each firm makes in real time.

The site, designed by UK-based Happier, is also interesting because it highlights how successful the companies are in comparison to one another.

Phone makers Samsung, Apple, BlackBerry and Nokia all make the list, as do other hardware and software manufacturers Microsoft, Google, HP, Dell, Foxconn, IBM, Oracle and Cisco.

Facebook is the only social network on the list, earning $230 (£143) a second, and Amazon is the only online retailer and earns $1,996 (£1,247).

Samsung earns the most, by a considerable amount. According to the graphic, the Korean firm makes $6,486 (£4,051) per second.

Apple is in second place, earning $4,539 (£2,835) per second, with BlackBerry floundering at the bottom of the list earning a relatively small $205 (£128) every second.

The figures are all based on the companies¿ official respective earnings from the most recent quarterly reports available. Website Happier took these earning amounts for each firm and worked out exactly how many days had passed in that quarter

Apple, right, is in second place, earning $4,539 (£2,835) per second, with BlackBerry floundering at the bottom of the list earning a relatively small $205 (£128) a second

Samsung: $6,486 (£4,051) per second

Apple: $4,539 (£2,835)

Foxconn: $3,815 (£2,383)

HP: $3,459 (£2,160)

IBM: $3,166 (£1,978)

Cisco: $1,594 (£995)

Oracle: $1,068 (£667)

Nokia: $941 (£587)

Facebook: $230 (£143)

BlackBerry: $205 (£128)

In fact, BlackBerry, Nokia and Facebook were the only companies to make less than four figure amounts.

The figures are all based on the companies’ official respective earnings from the most recent quarterly reports available.

Happier took these earning amounts for each firm and worked out exactly how many days had passed in that quarter.

This can vary slightly between 90 and 92 days depending on when a company files their report.

To get to the amount each company makes per second, Happier divided a company’s earnings by days in this quarter.

This ‘day’ amount was then divided by 86,400 - the number of seconds in 24 hours - and the final figure was rounded.

According to the graphic, Microsoft makes more money than Google - $2,331 (£1,456) compared to $1,873 (£1,170)

Technology firm IBM does well, earning $3,166 (£1,978) a second, while Taiwanese electronics firm Foxconn is shown making $3,815 (£2,383) a second, and chip maker Intel makes $1,628 (£1,017) every second. 

When a user first clicks on the site, the counter next to each firm is reset to zero. As a visitor stays on the site, seconds tick by at the top of the page.

The amount each company makes - based on Happier’s figures - is updated in real-time in conjunction with this counter.

The size of the company, based on how much money they make, is indicated by the number of logos pictured next to their name.

The figures are all based on the companies' official respective earnings from the most recent quarterly reports available. Facebook, pictured, is the only social network on the list, and make $230 per second
