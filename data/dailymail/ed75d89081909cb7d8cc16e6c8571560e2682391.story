The president of the Oxford Union has been arrested on suspicion of rape and attempted rape.

Ben Sullivan, a history and politics student at Christ Church, Oxford, was yesterday questioned by police over the allegations, which relate to two female students at the university.

The 21-year-old was arrested yesterday morning after the two women made complaints about the alleged incidents which both happened more than a year ago. He was released on police bail until June 18.

Case dropped: Ben Sullivan, 21, will face no further action over allegations of rape and attempted rape

Ben Sullivan had planned to work as a researcher for former BP chief executive Lord Browne when his term ended

The banker’s son, a third year student whose final exams start next month, was elected unopposed to the illustrious post of president of the Oxford Union and took office last month.

The debating society has been a breeding ground for future prime ministers and politicians since it was founded in 1823, with William Gladstone, Herbert Asquith and Edward Heath among its alumni.

In more recent years, it has been a stepping stone to success for Foreign Secretary William Hague, Education Secretary Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London.

Westminster-born Mr Sullivan – a former pupil at £22,000-a-year St Paul’s in central London – also appears to have political ambitions.

On his LinkedIn page he claims that he is working as a project manager on a book for the controversial former BP boss Lord Browne.

The rape is alleged to have happened in January 2013, while the attempted rape is alleged to have happened a few months later in April.

One former student said: ‘This seems totally out of character. He seemed a really nice guy.’

Yesterday, David Nowell, senior censor at Christ Church, sent an email to students saying: ‘We have unfortunately received information that a Junior Member of Christ Church has been arrested and that this may become the subject of interest from the press.

‘Junior Members are reminded of the guidance in the Blue Book that they should be extremely cautious about talking to representatives of the media (including the student press) and that it is easy for information to be quoted out of context in a manner which may be unhelpful to individuals or to the Christ Church community.’

The Very Reverend Christopher Lewis, Dean of Christ Church, said: ‘As this matter is in the hands of the police, all we can say is a 21-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of rape and attempted rape and it is a member of this college.’

The Oxford Union did not respond to requests for a comment.

A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said: ‘A 21-year-old man from Oxford was arrested this morning on suspicion of rape and attempted rape.’

They would not confirm how many women were involved but said that the rape allegedly occurred in January 2013 and the attempted rape allegedly occurred in April.

The Oxford Union is the world's most 
famous debating society, famed for hosting all manner of speakers.

Founded in 1823, its presidency has acted as the training ground for three British prime ministers - Edward Heath, WE Gladstone, and Herbert Henry Asquith.

More recently, Boris Johnson, Michael 
Gove, and William Hague have taken the revered post of president.

Speakers have ranged from the Dalai Lama to Katie Price.

Yasser Arafat, Bobby Kennedy, Michael Jackson and Shakira have also spoken.

The Union controversially hosted Malcom X in the 1960s and President Richard Nixon's first speech after Watergate.

In 1996, O. J. Simpson came to the union to make his only speech in Britain regarding his criminal trial.

In 1933, just as Hitler came to power in Germany, the Union caused national outcry by controversially voting that they would not 'fight for King and Country'.

The motion was passed by 275 votes to 153.

Winston Churchill denounced the result as 'that abject, squalid, shameless avowal' and 'this ever shameful motion'.
