The Nebraska doctors treating an American aid worker infected with Ebola said today he has responded well to aggressive treatment in the past week.

Dr Rick Sacra received blood transfusions from Ebola survivor Dr Kent Brantly shortly after he arrived at the Nebraska Medical Center last Friday, Dr Phil Smith said on Thursday.

The 51-year-old Sacra, who had been working at a hospital in Liberia, also received an experimental drug that doctors refuse to identify. And he has received supportive care including IV fluids.

Smith says doctors wanted to treat Sacra with everything available to give him the best chance of recovering.

The doctors treating Sacra are talking with doctors at Emory University Hospital who have treated three other Ebola patients. 

They hope to develop to develop new treatment plans based on the experience.

Dr Sacra's wife Debbie spoke of her deep gratitude to Dr Brantly for donating his blood to help her husband. Mrs Sacra said that she and Dr Brantly's wife Amber had marveled that both their sick husband's shared a blood type.  

She said: 'It really meant a lot to us that he was willing to give that donation so soon after his own recovery.'

Dr Sacra, who is being treated in a special biocontainment unit at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, received two doses of plasma from Brantly, which doctors are calling a convalescent serum.

'I don't know how much of his recovery is due to the drug, how much is due to the convalescent serum and how much to the aggressive intravenous fluids,' Dr Smith said.

Brantly's blood likely contains protective antibodies that may help buy Sacra some time while his body tries to fight off the infection, Smith said.

The hospital tried a number of potential donors, but Brantly's blood type turned out to be a match for his friend and fellow missionary Sacra. 

The worst-ever Ebola outbreak, which has already killed at least 2,296 people in West Africa, has triggered a scramble to develop the first drug or vaccine for a deadly disease that was discovered nearly 40 years ago in the forests of central Africa.

Smith said he has been asked not to disclose the name of the experimental drug Sacra is receiving because it is still in the early stages of development and there is no data on whether it works.

Sacra arrived at the Nebraska hospital from Liberia on Friday, September 5, and has since shown a 'remarkable improvement,' Dr. Angela Hewlett told the briefing.

Smith said Sacra's first day was 'pretty rocky' but he began improving by the third day of care. His wife, Debbie, said she is 'amazed' at how quickly Sacra has 'turned around since he arrived.'

She said Sacra contracted Ebola on August 29 while working at a hospital in Liberia on behalf of the North Carolina-based Christian group SIM USA. Sacra had worked in the obstetrics ward at the ELWA Hospital of SIM in Monrovia.
