Madcap footballer Mario Balotelli has been linked with the purchase of an extravagant £4.75m 'Teletubbies' mansion after he moved back to the Premier League.

The £16m striker, who signed for Liverpool last month, is rumoured to be interested in the Cheshire property, complete with its own swimming pool, football pitch and helipad.

Current owner, the entrepreneur Steve O’Connor and his wife Clare have insisted that the property remains on the market with Chester estate agents Savills.

Fit for a footballer? Mario Balotelli, 24, is believed to be considering this Cheshire home, complete with football pitch, as he prepares to move from Milan to the north west

Helipad: The helipad, overlooking 10 miles of countryside, allows the owner get to London in an hour, which will be welcome news to notorious party-goer Balotelli

Retreat: The mansion is a long drive from Anfield Stadium but it could act as a haven for the Premier League star who attracts plenty of attention in the UK

Balotelli, 24, is known to be house hunting in the area after returning to the country from AC Milan in Italy. He played for Manchester City between 2010 and 2013

The home, in Frodsham, includes five 
bedrooms, four of which are described as suites, as well as an indoor 
swimming pool, sauna, gym sports hall, sports bar, offices, a helipad 
and large gardens.

Much of 
the property is built below ground, with grassed roofs covering the 
property, with windows reminiscent of the Teletubbies home in the 
children’s TV show.

Balotelli,
 24, is known to be house hunting in the area after returning to the 
country after starring for Inter and AC Milan in Italy. He played for 
Manchester City between 2010 and 2013 earning as much interest in his 
off-the field antics and his exploits on the pitch.

Green: No doubt the Italian striker will enjoy the luscious grass surrounding the property as he jets back from a stint at the sunnier club AC Milan

Light: The previous owners made sure to put windows wherever possible so that the
 underground property is filled with light and does not have damp

Before: This is the two-storey cottage perched on a sloping hill that current owner Steve O'Connor transformed into a modern estate that delves underground

The property is described on the 
estate agent’s website as 'a discreet and private house, perfectly 
aligned to contemporary living, in a stunning position'.

It
 reads: 'It embraces the functional aspects of neo modern architecture 
and key attributes of modern technology to provide a versatile and 
comfortable living environment.

'The
 relaxed, free-flowing nature of the property belies the sophistication 
of the design. A substantial section of the property lies beneath the 
original ground level and yet the light, air quality and views are 
exceptional.

'The fully 
integrated technology includes keyless doors, some with fingerprint 
recognition, an audio/visual system supporting various satellite feeds, 
lutron lighting both mechanical and natural climate control.

Work site: The couple spent years working on the land to create a home that fits their exact interests and activities

Modern: Liverpool's new signing will no doubt be enticed by this unusual, long 
swimming pool and adjacent sauna with French windows that open onto 
grass

Living space: Underneath the sprawling garden there is a 100ft hallway that leads onto a kitchen, dining area, and access to five bedrooms

'There
 are both large and small spaces within the structure, with the main 
living area being largely open plan. The leisure facilities are 
exceptional and range from an indoor sports hall to a gym, indoor pool 
with a sauna and jacuzzi, to an outdoor 3G surfaced 5-aside football 
pitch.'

The enormous estate, carved into a cliffside, started life as a two-storey cottage.

Despite heavy planning restrictions, 
the couple worked closely with an architect to transform their home into
 something 10 times the size. The house is surrounded by a network of caves which help control the temperature. 

And thanks to the addition of a 
helipad, the couple and their two sons Stevie, nine, and Ryan, four, can
 get to London in an hour.

Mr O'Connor, who owns Widnes Viking Rugby League team, said: 'It is essentially a
 modern day country house in size, but if you took out our indulgence, 
the swimming pool, it would have the same energy costs as a three bed 
semi.'

Temperature in the 
home is controlled using a unique air tower which releases hot air in 
the top and lets in cold air at the bottom.

Dining room: The £16 million striker could soon be dining in this minimal, 
purple-and-white-themed room which is separated from the living room 
with a free-standing wall

Activity: The property will suit buyers with many interests as there is space for a grand piano alongside the football pitch and swimming pool

Innovative: The underground home is heated by a network of caves, which 
helped the previous owners get around planning 
restrictions

Open space: This living space and kitchen area, complete with a breakfast bar, is set in the space above the 100ft hall way

Cutting edge: Property developer Mr O'Connor said he has worked for years with an architect to develop the home from a shabby cottage into a modern complex

Despite the vast amount of open space, the home has the same energy 
costs as a three-bedroom semi-detached cottage
