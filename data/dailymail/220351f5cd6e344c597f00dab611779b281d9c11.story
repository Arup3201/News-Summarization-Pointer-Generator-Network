It is rapidly becoming tradition at this time of year for men to sprout moustaches as part of the increasingly popular Movember charity campaign.

But the latest fundraiser to let their facial hair grow wild in the name of a good cause is a 36-year-old woman.

Brave Siobhain Fletcher, 36, who suffers from polycystic ovary syndrome and has spent years trying to hide her facial hair, has ditched her clippers for the month of November to grow a moustache and beard for charity.

Good cause: Siobhain Fletcher has spent her life trying to hide her facial hair, but has ditched the clippers to raise money for charity as part of the Movember campaign

The Movember campaign encourages men to quit shaving for the month of November to raise awareness and funds for men's health - specifically prostate cancer and testicular cancer.

Mrs Fletcher, who usually shaves every other day, is already sporting a wispy beard and the beginnings of a moustache after deciding to take part.

Having struggled with facial hair since puberty, the housewife was finally diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) 12 years ago when she and her husband Jim struggled to conceive.

Inspiring: Mrs Fletcher said growing her facial hair would be worth it if it encouraged just one man to get a life-saving health check

Mrs Fletcher said the problem had driven her to depression in the past, but that she was prepared to overcome her embarassment if it meant more men would address potentially life-threatening health issues.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), is a hormonal imbalance in which women’s ovaries produce excessive amounts of the male hormone testosterone.

This results in the formation of small harmless cysts on the ovaries.

Excessive hair growth - known as hirsutism - is just one of the symptoms of the condition, alongside erratic periods, weight gain, acne, and fertility problems.

The condition, which affects one in ten British women, should not be confused with polycystic ovaries, which merely describes the appearance of small cysts on the ovaries. Roughly 20 per cent of women have this condition with no effects at all and no problems conceiving.

Women with PCOS have both the cysts and the symptoms caused by excess testosterone.

'If I can go out on the street with a beard or moustache for a month, then surely men who are experiencing health problems can go and get themselves tested.

'I think it is awful that some men are too embarassed to have a simple test which could save them from prostate or testicular cancer.

'My facial hair used to contribute to depression and anxiety but this is for a good cause and I want to highlight that people shouldn't judge you on what you have on your face, it's what is inside that matters.'

The 36-year-old has already raised £200 on her Movember fundraising page, on which she has included a message describing how she hopes 'to use my PCOS as a tool for raising awareness for men's cancers - if I get just one man to get checked out it will be worth it'.

Mrs Fletcher's page has been inundated with posts from donors impressed by her decision to reveal the embarassing side-effect of her condition for a good cause.

One comment said: 'I think you are fab for doing this!! Very inspiring!!'

Another read: 'As a fellow PCOS sufferer I know I'm nowhere near as brave as you but you rock - great kudos to your courage.'
