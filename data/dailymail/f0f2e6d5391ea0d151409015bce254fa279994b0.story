Prime Minister Tony Abbott has defended himself against the suggestion in a live radio interview that he is guilty of bullying behaviour.

ABC radio host Jon Faine probed Tony Abbott while the prime minister was on his way an anti-bullying conference in Melbourne on Friday morning.

Mr Faine questioned Mr Abbott's credibility on speaking about the topic when he had been accused of being a bully himself.

Mr Abbott released a video this week addressing Australian youths and pledging his allegiance to victims of bullying.

'What credibility do you have on bullying - you've been accused of it so often yourself?' Mr Faine asked.

'You yourself admit you have an aggressive streak - isn't that the core of bullying?'

Mr Abbott responded by saying the comment was 'without foundation.'

'Obviously when I feel strongly about things I argue strongly for them but of the things I've always tried to do is give credit where it's due,' Mr Abbott told Mr Faine.

In another segment, the broadcaster asked the prime minister about a string of controversial comments. He mentioned Mr Abbott's recent comment about Aboriginal people living in remote communities as being 'lifestyle choices' and his comparing of Labor leader Bill Shorten to Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebells.

'Mr Abbott, for a Rhodes scholar, how come you say so many stupid things?' he asked.

In another segment, the Prime Minister was asked why he continues to make ill-advised comments despite his esteemed education

'All of us from time to time in the heat of debate, and you know how heated the Parliament can get, sometimes can go too far,' Mr Abbott said.

It comes after Mr Abbott sparked outcry on Thursday when he likened Labour Party leader Bill Shorten to the Germany WWII propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels.

One month earlier, Abbott had referenced the Nazi's another time when he claimed job losses in the Defence industry under the former Labor government amounted to a 'Holocaust of jobs'.

Last week, Mr Abbott prompted furore for indigenous communities when he backed a plan in to close more than 100 remote communities saying 'what we can't do is endlessly subsidise lifestyle choices'.
