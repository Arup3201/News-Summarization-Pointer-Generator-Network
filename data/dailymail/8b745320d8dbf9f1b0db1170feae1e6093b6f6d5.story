With England’s autumn series kicking off on Saturday, Sir Clive Woodward sets the scene for their four crucial matches. Sam Peters asks the questions.

Sam Peters: How do you see the QBE series going for England and where are Stuart Lancaster’s team compared to yours at this stage 12 years ago?

Sir Clive Woodward: The current group of English players is just as talented as the 2003 squad, but I just don’t think we’ve seen the right XV on the field playing the style of rugby required to win a World Cup. You need to create a team that can outscore any side in the world. Let’s be very clear: to win a World Cup you have to be able to outscore the southern hemisphere sides and not just the Six Nations teams.

Can England beat New Zealand on Saturday? Yes. Can they win four out of four games? Absolutely.

Peters: You beat the southern hemisphere’s top three in 2002. What did you say to the players before that series of matches?

Woodward: At the beginning of a series like this everyone tries to figure out what an acceptable set of results will look like and what impact they will have on our chances at the World Cup. But ultimately it is all about the here and now and that was the approach we took in 2002. I made it clear to the players that there wasn’t going to be any selection based on ‘development’. Every team was picked to win the next game and nothing else.

We staged the autumn tests as a series of ‘knockout fixtures’ to create that must-win-match attitude. We knew that if we won all three we would become the IRB’s No 1 ranked team, which would make for a great Christmas. In public we played it down, but privately that was the goal at the end of these three ‘knockout games’.

Peters: What do you put England’s injury crisis down to?

Woodward: During my time, there were all sorts of battles going on between clubs and the union over the management of the players and, specifically, how much rugby they were playing and how they were managed when they became injured. I was determined to be at the front of the discussions in order to get what I felt was best for the players and the England team.

Post-World Cup, my first major disagreement with the RFU came when it was decided, without my input, that the clubs would not only lead on the medical well-being of a player, but it was their decision whether they played or not.

The RFU’s medical team believed they could ensure the player’s well-being by simply working closely with the club doctors. I totally disagreed with that philosophy. Players come under peer pressure. They are left in an impossible situation and end up playing when injured because they want to do what’s best for their club.

England’s current injury list has gone beyond simple bad luck. I would need more details before commenting on an individual basis, but Joe Launchbury’s problem surprises me. It appears from the outside as if he’s been carrying the injury for some time while continuing to play for Wasps. Why is he now missing England games?

Are we now in a position where, because England are going to have all their top players from May, there is an acceptance the clubs are the priority until then? That can’t be right. We have five of the starting XV injured and Mike Brown looks like he needs a rest, too.

I always encouraged the players to take individual responsibility for their well-being. Collectively the players understood the bigger picture and the effect playing with injuries at club level had to our England ambitions. We should not be facing the three biggest teams in the world with so many injuries, and it’s no surprise they are arriving with fully-fit squads.

Peters: So how does Lancaster approach the series?

Woodward: Frustrating though these injuries are, England have depth — and now is the time to prove that to New Zealand, South Africa and Australia.

I would be seriously concerned leaving Twickenham for the last time before the World Cup having been beaten by an England team depleted by injuries. England players won’t need reminding how great an opportunity this is to make the shirt their own, but privately I would still be winding players up. It’s wrong to play down the New Zealand game and suggest that with our injuries it’s merely a good chance to develop the squad.

It’s times like this that Lancaster will see everything he needs to from the peripheral players. Can they cut it at the very top of the international game? By the end of this series he’ll know all he needs to know about guys such as Semesa Rokoduguni, Dave Attwood and Kyle Eastmond.

Let’s not hide behind development, team culture or valiant efforts. We’re at Twickenham. Let’s beat these teams and be bold about it.

Peters: Which players excite you most going into the series?

Woodward: It’s a worry for me that no players immediately leap off the team-sheet as real X-factor types. Rokoduguni is a fantastic story and I’m looking forward to seeing if he can translate his club form on to the international stage but, make no mistake, he’s going to be targeted by the All Blacks on Saturday.

If he can withstand that and come through in credit then it will give him enormous confidence going into the rest of the series.

But Rokoduguni is keeping some top-class wings out of the side in Christian Wade, David Strettle and Chris Ashton — so he’s got plenty to prove.

Peters: What about from the opposition?

Woodward: Israel Folau is such a powerful and destructive runner and absolutely superb under the high ball. He gives Australia a completely different attacking option with his pace and physicality. He’s a brilliant player who will excite anyone who watches him.

Whoever the Wallabies play at 10-12 will also be a threat. They went for Quade Cooper and Matt Toomua against the Barbarians, but they have such an array of talent, with players such as Christian Lealiifano waiting in the wings, that their midfield combination is bound to be dangerous. Then there’s Handre Pollard. The 20-year-old fly-half was absolutely outstanding for the Springboks as they beat the All Blacks when the sides last met. With a traditionally monstrous Springbok pack in front of him, he looks a huge prospect.

I’m also a huge admirer of lock Eben Etzebeth. He’s a hugely powerful athlete who walks like a gunslinger and has an attitude to match.

Peters: Sorry for repeating myself, but can England really beat the All Blacks?

Woodward: Of course they can. The great thing for them is that public expectation levels are low because of the players missing. There’s almost nothing to lose. They can cast off the shackles and play with a pace and tempo that gets the Twickenham crowd on their feet. I’m excited by that prospect and I really hope the players are, too.
