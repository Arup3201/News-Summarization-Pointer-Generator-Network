Some of the passengers' whose luggage was

They were arrested at the San Francisco airport on July 25, 2013, as they were about to board a flight to Hawaii. Some of the items Crudup and Thomas stole from other people's luggage was found in their possession.

A subsequent search of their home found even more stolen items, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.

Thomas will surrender to custody in December to start serving time, while Crudup will follow in December.

The Asiana crash on July 6, 2013 killed three Chinese students on board the flight from Seoul. More than 200 other people were injured. The accident wreaked havoc on the San Francisco airport for days, cancelling flights and diverting others.
