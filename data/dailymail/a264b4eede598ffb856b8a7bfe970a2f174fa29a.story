Just a quarter of eighth and 12th grade students in the United States have solid writing skills, even when allowed to use spell-check and other computer word processing tools, according to results of a national exam released on Friday.

Twenty-four per cent of students at each grade level were able to write essays that were well developed, organized and had proper language and grammar. Three per cent scored as advanced and the remaining students had just partial mastery of these skills.

Students who took the writing test 
inn 2011 had an advantage that previous test takers did not: a computer 
with spell-check and thesaurus.

'It is important to remember this is first draft writing,' said Cornelia Orr, executive director of the National Assessment Governing Board, which administers the Nation's Report Card tests.

'They did have some time to edit, but it wasn't extensive editing,' she added in comments to the Associated Press.

Previously, students taking the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)
 writing test had to use pencil and paper, but with changes in 
technology, and the need to write across electronic formats, the 
decision was made to switch to computers.

She said word processing 
tools alone wouldn't result in significantly better writing scores if 
students didn't have the core skills of being able to organize ideas and
 present them in a clear and grammatical fashion.

Still,
 students in both grades who used the thesaurus and the backspace key 
more frequently had higher scores than those who used them less often. 
Students in the 12th grade who had to write four or five pages a week 
for English homework also had higher scores.

Because
 this was the first version of the computerized test, the board 
cautioned against comparing the results to previous exams. In 2007, 33 
per cent of eighth grade students scored at the proficient level, which 
represents solid writing skills, as did 24 per cent at grade 12.

The results at both grade levels showed a continued achievement gap between white, black, Hispanic and Asian students.

At
 the eighth grade, Asian students had the highest average score, which 
was 33 points higher than black students on a 300-point scale. At the 
12th grade, white students scored 27 points above black students.

The NAEP is a congressionally 
authorized project of the National Center for Education Statistics 
(NCES) within the Institute of Education Sciences of the U.S. Department
 of Education.

Orr said 
students use technology and tools like spell-check on a daily basis. 
'It's as if years ago we had given them a pencil to write the essay and 
took away the eraser,' she said.

The numbers: A significant achievement gap was found between white, black, Hispanic and Asian students

There was also a gender gap, with 
girls scoring 20 points higher on average than boys in the eighth grade 
and 14 points higher in 12th grade.

Those
 who qualified for free and reduced price lunch, a key indicator of 
poverty, also had lower scores than those who did not; there was a 27 
point difference between the two at the eighth grade.

For
 the 2011 exam, laptops were brought into public and private schools 
across the country and more than 50,000 students were tested to get a 
nationally representative sample. Students were given prompts that 
required them to write essays that explained, persuaded or conveyed an 
experience.

Kathleen 
Blake Yancey, a professor at Florida State University who served on the 
advisory panel for the test, said one factor to keep in mind is that 
research shows most students in the United States don't compose at the 
keyboard.

'What they do 
is sort of type already written documents into the machine, much as we 
used to do with typewriters four decades ago,' she said.

Yancey
 said for this reason, there was some concern about having students 
write on the computer as opposed to by hand.

Likewise, having the 
advantage of spell-check assumes students know how to use it. And in 
some schools and neighborhoods, computers are still not easily 
accessible.

Technology: In the first version of the computerized test, students still didn't have the core skills of being able to organize ideas and present them in a clear and grammatical fashion

'There are not so many students that actually learn to write composing at the keyboard,' she said.

Yancey
 added that many kids who do have access to computers are not 
necessarily using them to write at school, but to take standardized 
tests and filling in bubbles.

'Digital
 technology is a technology,' she said. 'Paper and pencil is a 
technology. If technology were the answer, that would be pretty simple.'
