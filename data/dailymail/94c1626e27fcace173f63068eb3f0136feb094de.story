Mario Balotelli's agent has revealed the striker is 'very disappointed' with his time at Liverpool but has no immediate plans to leave the club.

The former AC Milan striker has failed to score a single Premier League goal since arriving at Anfield for £16million and has faced considerable criticism from supporters.

But Balotelli's agent, Mino Raiola, said the striker is not ready to turn his back on Brendan Rodgers.

'The plan is to continue at Anfield,' Raiola told Gazzetta dello Sport. 'I saw him Monday and told him: "You have a four-year contract and I won't bring you away. Or you leave Liverpool at 60-70 million, and I won my bet, or you'll die there."

'It's the first time I've made a speech like that to a player. I've seen him quiet, changed, different than Milan.

'He's very disappointed with himself, too. He's going through a bad time like he never had. In Liverpool he hasn't his spaces: if you don't make things as they want, you stay out. Then he was broken for eight weeks, he lost the rhythm.'
