This ordinarily cute-looking bird doesn't seem so friendly any more! Amazing pictures taken in a park in India show a tiny kingfisher bird devouring a snake, after having swooped down to catch it.

The White-throated Kingfisher munches on the snake as it sits atop a tree at the Keoladeo National Park in Bharatpur, Rajasthan.

The White-throated Kingfisher is widely distributed throughout the Indian sub-continent and can be spotted away from water bodies where it feeds on small amphibians, rodents, birds and even reptiles such as snakes.
