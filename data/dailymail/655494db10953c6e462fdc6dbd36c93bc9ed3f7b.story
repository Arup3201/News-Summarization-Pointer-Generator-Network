It might not be the most flashy of cars in which to perform a ram raid - but this criminal got what he wanted, even though he was caught four months later and jailed for life.

Wayne Colligan, 43, drove his Nissan Micra into the Halifax building society in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, to grab almost £70,000 as staff loaded the cashpoint, before driving off.

One bank worker was left on the floor with damaged ligaments after she was forced to jump out of the vehicle’s path, before Colligan shouted ‘This is a f****** raid’ and stole £68,450 in less than a minute.

Ram raider: Wayne Colligan, 43, drove his Nissan Micra into the Halifax building society in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, to grab almost £70,000 as staff loaded the cashpoint, before driving off

Scary: One bank worker was left on the floor with damaged ligaments after she was forced to jump out of the careering vehicle's path, before Colligan shouted 'This is a f****** raid' and stole £68,450

Sentenced: Wayne Colligan (left) was jailed for life, while his accomplice David Cope (right), 49, who played 'a minor role' by acquiring the vehicles for the raids, was given four years

Julia Faure Walker, prosecuting, said:
 ‘Colligan’s method was to ram a car into the bank doors at speed while 
bank staff were replenishing the cash machines. A Ford Ka was used for 
observation.’

She said 
during the robbery on January 24 last year, Colligan ‘reversed a Nissan 
Micra into Halifax and stole £68,450’. While inside, she said he moved 
to the passenger side and got out.

He
 shouted: ‘This is a f****** raid - no-one say or do anything, then 
no-one will get hurt’. Colligan then ‘picked up the ATM cartridges from 
the floor, got back into the Nissan Micra and drove away’.

Colligan
 was caught by armed Flying Squad officers on May 8 last year after 
attempting an identical ram raid at an HSBC bank on Wanstead, east 
London, using a specially-adapted Citroen Berlingo.

The
 internal cage had been removed and a plank as large as ‘a railway 
sleeper’ ran the length of the van, to increase its ramming potential.

Gone: The thief speeds away from the high street bank along the pavement, before rejoining the road

Colligan, who was wearing two sets of 
gloves and armed with a loaded pistol, admitted he was ‘bang to rights’,
 adding: ‘It’s a fair cop’.

He was sentenced to life imprisonment and ordered to serve at least seven years and eight months.

Accomplice David Cope, 49, who played ‘a minor role’ by acquiring the vehicles for the raids, was given four years.

Judge
 Nicholas Cooke QC said: ‘Attacks on high street banks in broad daylight
 terrify the public and bank employees. The offending at the heart of 
this indictment amounts to professionally planned commercial robbery.

‘You
 are a professional criminal, and as carrying a semi-automatic pistol 
clearly illustrates, potentially a very dangerous man. It is agreed by 
all parties that you are liable to a mandatory life sentence.’

Colligan
 had been released early on licence from an 11-year sentence for robbing
 a Halifax bank in Harold Hill, Essex, back in 2003.

The
 judge commented: ‘The reality is it [the gun] has a round in the breach
 and the slide is back, therefore it is very close to firing condition’.

He added that the failed raid in Wanstead was ‘in literary terms at least, within the shadow of Snaresbrook Crown Court’.

In
 2006, Colligan was accused of involvement in the shooting of Cameron 
Black, a close friend of ex-prime minister John Major, who had tried to 
foil a raid in Southgate, north London.

Previous case: In 2006, Colligan was accused of involvement in the shooting of Cameron Black (pictured), a close friend of ex-Prime Minister John Major, who had tried to foil a raid in Southgate, north London

Mr Black, a godfather to Mr Major’s son, James, survived his injuries and prosecutors dropped their case against Colligan after a jury failed to agree a verdict.

Colligan’s then associate, career criminal Wayne Ellis, 39, of Manor Park, east London, later received 15 years for the point-blank shooting.

Colligan, of Grays, Essex, admitted two counts of conspiracy to rob, one count of possessing a firearm with an intent to commit an indictable offence, possession of an imitation firearm, possession of ammunition without a licence and possession of a firearm.

Cope, of Dagenham, east London, admitted two counts of conspiracy to rob.
