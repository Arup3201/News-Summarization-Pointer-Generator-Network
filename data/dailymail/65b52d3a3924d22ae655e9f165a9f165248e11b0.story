A daughter whose mother was raped and murdered is facing a lifetime of never knowing where the killer buried her - because it would breach his human rights.

Both Martin Stafford's prison and the European Union are stopping mother-of-one Tracy Richardson, 30, of Swinton, Greater Manchester, from contacting him.

Stafford, 45, was found guilty and jailed for the murder of Michelle Gunshon and sentenced to life in prison. He was also found guilty of false imprisonment, rape and preventing the burial of a body.

Although the crimes were committed in 
2004, Stafford evaded arrest when he fled the country and was only 
brought to justice in 2012 after a trial at Birmingham Crown Court.

He
 was extradited from Ireland, where he had been serving time in jail for
 rape and false imprisonment. But Stafford has never disclosed where he 
left the body of Mrs Gunshon.

Ms Richardson told the Sunday Mirror that the unidentified jail would not hand the 
murderer a letter from her because the governor thought it would be 
'intrusive' and in breach of his human rights.

She
 then discovered police cannot ask Stafford where Mrs Gunshon’s body is 
buried, because he has to give them consent to ask him, according to the
 terms of his EU extradition from Ireland.

Ms
 Richardson can now only find out where her mother is buried by asking 
Stafford to tell her in person - but she must get a visitation order in 
order to do this, and that must be signed by Stafford.

In memory: Now the only way Ms Richardson can find out the truth is to beg Stafford to tell her in person

‘I'm
 in total shock,’ she told the newspaper. ‘He should have lost his human
 rights the second he decided to commit those evil crimes.

'He's not a 
human in my eyes, he's a monster. All
 I want is to lay mum to rest and give her the dignity she deserves.

'But
 I have no hope of doing that unless someone gets Stafford to admit 
where she is.’

Mrs Gunshon 
was aged 38 and working as a security guard at Birmingham's NEC when she
 went missing in 2004. Traces of semen and blood were found in 
her car following her death.

Stafford
 worked in the Dubliner pub in Digbeth, Birmingham, when he met Mrs 
Gunshon. He had murdered her before 'spiriting her body away' and 
fleeing the country, a court heard.

He
 was issued with a European Arrest Warrant and extradited to be charged 
with her murder after completing a rape sentence in 2012 - but was never
 asked by police where he put the body, as a condition of this warrant.

Ms
 Richardson said: ‘They won't even tell me what prison he's in. I have 
no hope any more. It doesn't make sense - he's a convicted murderer. Why
 is everyone protecting him?’

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘We are committed to supporting crime victims and are looking into this.’
