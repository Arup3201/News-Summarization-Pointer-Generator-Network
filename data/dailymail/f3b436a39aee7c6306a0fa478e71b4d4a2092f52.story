Arsenal are set to explore a move for Manchester United forward Danny Welbeck to help ease the loss of injury victim Olivier Giroud.

As Sportsmail revealed on Tuesday, Giroud is facing an extended period on the sidelines after sustaining an ankle injury against Everton on Saturday.

Arsene Wenger will move to strengthen his forward line before next week's transfer deadline, and Welbeck features on the club's list of options.

Sportsmail understands the Gunners were keen on Welbeck prior to Giroud's injury, but fears over the Frenchman has seen their interest intensify.

It is believed Welbeck would give serious consideration to a move to the Emirates Stadium.

But whether United would sell the England international to a rival remains to be seen.

Queens Park Rangers frontman Loic Remy is also a realistic option for Arsenal.

Paris Saint-Germain striker Edinson Cavani is a long-term target for the club, but a move for the Uruguayan seem remote given the vast cost of any deal.

Option: QPR's Loic Remy is also being considered by Arsenal, but his wage demands could be an issue 

Priced out: Uruguayan striker Edinson Cavani is highly rated but will likely be too expensive for Arsenal
