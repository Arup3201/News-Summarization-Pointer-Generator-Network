Modern professional wrestling contains many theatrics and sometimes pre-determined outcomes.

But although the lurid costumes might be new, there is now proof that ancient wrestling matches were fixed too.

Historians have deciphered a delicate Greek papyrus dating from 267AD, which shows that the outcome of a wrestling match between two teenagers was predetermined.

Oxyrhynchus lies south west of Cairo and is considered to be one of the most important archaeological sites in Egypt.

It has yielded a huge collection of papyrus texts from the Ptolemaic and Roman periods of Egyptian history and among them are fragments of plays and the Gospel of Thomas.

The city was built around a system of canals and inhabitants dumped their rubbish at nearby sand hills, including lots of written material as Oxyrhynchus was governed bureaucratically by the Greeks and the Romans.

Archaeologists have discovered tax returns, census material, receipts, letters about religion, politics, military action and diaries, giving them a thorough picture of everyday life.

In 1896, two young excavators - Bernard Grenfell and Arthur Hunt - from the University of Oxford began to excavate the site and combed through the rubbish.

While they were concerned with finding works of high literature, they realised the importance of the discarded everyday material.

Some 500,000 papyrus fragments are now kept at the university's Sackler Library; among them the account of match fixing.

The contract is the first proof of match-fixing ever discovered.

It was made between the father of a wrestler called Nicantinous and the trainers of Demetrius who were set to wrestle in the final of the 138th 'Great Antinoeia', which was a series of games held during a religious festival in Egypt.

The contract says that Demetrius must ‘when competing in the competition for the boy [wrestlers]...fall three times and yield’ and in turn he would be rewarded with ‘three thousand eight hundred drachmas of silver of old coinage.’

The ancient bribe also contains a clause that Demetrius would still get his money if the judges picked up on the fact the match was fixed and refused to grant Nicantinous victory.

To make absolutely sure of a win, Nicantinous’ father arranged in the contract that if Demetrius backed out of the deal and went on to win, his trainers would have to pay a larger sum of money to his son.

Dominic Rathbone, a professor at King's College London who translated the papyrus, told Live Science that 3,800 drachma - the cost of the original bribe - was not a large amount of money and could have bought a donkey.

In a fair match, wrestlers fought to throw each other to the ground three times, using a number of holds and throws, some of which reportedly resembled body slams seen in modern professional wrestling.

The contract was discovered in Oxyrhynchus, in Egypt - around 100miles (160km) south west of Cairo - more than a century ago and has only been recently translated, with the document kept at the Sackler library at the University of Oxford.

Professor Rathbone explained that ancient people made such brides to reduce their losses as the training of athletes was expensive and there were no prizes for runners-up.

‘If you were confident you would win, normally you would go for it. If you're not sure you would win, maybe you're cutting your risk by saying, “At least I get the bribe,”’ Professor Rathbone said.

It was not unusual for winners to be paid large amounts of money or to receive lifetime pensions.

However, experts are baffled as to why a written contract was drawn up as it would have been difficult to take to court if either side backed-put of the deal. They do not think that it was specially drawn up by a scribe with legal knowledge.

While the papyrus is the only known written record of match fixing in ancient times, there are references to it in accounts of the times and the practice was relatively common in the Roman Empire.
