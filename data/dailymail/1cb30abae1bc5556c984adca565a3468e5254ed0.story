More than half of London's top property sales last year went to overseas buyers, with Russian nationals topping the league after UK house-hunters.

Russian nationals are understood to have acquired £266million-plus homes in the capital, spending a staggering £429million.

People from the UK purchased 2,183 of the 4,510 homes sold in this price bracket in 2010, according to the data.

Steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal's £70million property in Kensington Palace Gardens was bought in 2008

In addition, research from Lloyds TSB earlier this month found that sales of homes worth at least £1million recently reached their highest level since the peak of the housing market in 2007.

Strong demand from wealthy cash-rich 
buyers, both in the UK and from overseas, as well as limited supply of 
such properties is thought to have boosted sales.

It is the latest evidence that Britain is increasingly seen as a save haven for assets during the worsening financial crisis.

A number of the world's most wealthy people, including non-Britons Indian steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal and Roman Abramovich have properties in London.

And many of the 86 residential properties at the Candy Brothers' One Hyde Park, marketed with prices starting at around £20 million, have been snapped up by foreigners.

Here are the top 10 purchasers of £1 
million-plus properties London in 2010, the estimated number of 
properties purchased and their worth, according to HBC:

1. UK 2,183 £3,517,122,197

2. Russia 266 £428,740,103

3. UAE 198 £319,738,382

4. US 167 £268,870,912

5=. Singapore 135 £218,003,442

5=. France 135 £218,003,442

7. India 126 £203,469,879

8=. Hong Kong 104 £167,135,972

8=. Italy 104 £167,135,972

10. China 90 £145,335,628

Other 1,002 £1,613,225,470

Total 4,510 £7,266,781,399

Aircraft manufacturer Hawker Beechcraft Corporation (HBC), which partly based its analysis on Land Registry data, believes that the large number of foreign buyers of prime property in London has contributed to an increase in business flights to some of the region's main business airports.

Sean McGeough, HBC president, Europe, Middle East and Africa, said: 'As one of the most desirable cities in the world, it's no surprise that London's property market is attracting a large number of overseas buyers.

'Given that many of these individuals lead busy lives and often travel a huge amount, this helps explain the rise in flights to London's business airports.'

HBC found that the number of business flights to Biggin Hill, London City and Farnborough increased by 46 per cent, 38 per cent and 34 per cent respectively between January and September.
