Sam Burgess said an emotional farewell to his girlfriend Phoebe Hooke and brother Luke  as the new Bath signing left Sydney for the UK to start his rugby union career as a centre for the Aviva Premiership club.

It was an emotional day for all involved as Burgess said goodbye to  his loved ones at the airport.

Fortunately for the injured star, his Australian girlfriend Hooke will be joining him in Bath in a couple of weeks.  Luke, meanwhile, will remain Down Under playing for the South Sydney Rabbitohs - the club his brother Sam  has just left.

Burgess fractured his cheekbone and eye socket during South Sydney's NRL grand final win earlier this month, but hopes to be back in action soon.

Pointing to the nasty scar under his eye where the surgeon had to enter to get to his cheekbone he said: 'It's alright, it's healed up pretty well. It's two and a half weeks post surgery.'

Hooke admitted: 'There were a few sponge baths' after the nasty injury. 

The 25-year-old Burgess went on to reveal that he was feeling 'a bit of a weird' about the move but said, 'once I get on the flight I should be OK.'
