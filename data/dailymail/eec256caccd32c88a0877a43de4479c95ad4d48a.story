The man wanted for driving the car that killed a pregnant woman, her husband and their child in Brooklyn has said his 'heart goes out to' the young family.

Julio Acevedo, 44, has eluded authorities since fleeing the crash that killed Nachman and Raizy Glauber, both 21, on Sunday. Their son, who was delivered by caesarean section, died on Monday.

But on Tuesday he vowed to turn himself in as he spoke out for the first time since the deaths.

'My
heart goes out to them,' Acevedo said of the couple as he spoke to the New York Daily News over the phone. 'I didn't know they died until I saw the 
news.'

Killer: Police are looking for Julio Acevedo, 44, in connection with the deaths of an expectant couple in Brooklyn. He previously served time in prison for shooting Kelvin '50 Cent' Martin, right, to death in 1987

Origins: His name inspired rapper 50 Cent, pictured, whose real name is Curtis Jackson

He added 
that he had been fleeing from gunshots when his car smashed into the cab
carrying the couple to hospital. He said he is making contact with a 
lawyer before contacting police.

It also emerged on Tuesday that Acevedo served eight years for a 
first-degree manslaughter charge for the 1987 shooting of his one-time 
associate Kelvin Martin, who went by the nickname of '50 Cent'.

Martin was the inspiration for the moniker assumed by platinum-selling rapper Curtis Jackson.

Acevedo has a long criminal record that includes time in Attica prison for Martin's death, two arrests for drug possession and arrests for robbery and reckless endangerment. His record also includes a 1997 robbery in the Bronx.

Just two weeks before the deadly crash in Williamsburg, he was stopped by police for driving erratically and his blood alcohol level was far above the 
legal level at .13.

Tragic: Nathan and Raizy Glauber, both 21, were on the way to hospital when they were killed in a hit-and-run car crash. Their son, who was delivered by emergency C section, has also died

Kelvin Martin lived at a housing project in Fort Greene, Brooklyn and terrorized the streets throughout the 1980s until his death aged 23.

He made a living through robberies and allegedly murdered local hustlers. Friends estimate that he sustained 24 bullet wounds and murdered at least 30 people in his life.

According to legend, Martin also stole from rap stars, such as LL Cool J. He allegedly robbed a gold chain from the rapper's neck in a parking lot in Brooklyn.

He was nicknamed '50 Cent' by his associates, but there are different theories over its origin.

It has been claimed the name came from his small stature - he was just 5ft 2 and weighed 120 pounds. Others say it referred to his robbery habit and how he would steal from someone, even if it were just for 50 cents. Another theory is that he once put down 50 cents in a dice game and won $500 back.

He was shot by Julio Acevedo on October 20, 1987 on the stairway of his girlfriend's building and died from hemorrhaging four days later. Acevedo was convicted of first-degree manslaughter and sentenced to a minimum of eight years in prison for the death.

In an interview with Vanity Fair last month, the rapper 50 Cent said: 'There was actually a guy from the Fort Greene projects [in Brooklyn, New York] who called himself 50 Cent. I used it as a metaphor for change. Musically, I had my own way of doing things.'

He told police he had drunk just two beers at a baby shower before he was pulled over. He was charged with a DWI but released the next day 
without bail.

A friend of Acevedo's from prison said 
Acevedo has called him seeking guidance at least four times since the 
crash, according to the New York Times.

'He has remorse,' the friend said. 'He wants to turn himself in.'

Isaac Abraham, a spokesman for the 
family's Orthodox Jewish community, called Acevedo a 'coward' before his arrest and demanded he be charged for three deaths.

'We in the community are demanding that 
the prosecutor charge the driver of BMW that caused the death of this 
couple and infant ... with triple homicide,' Abraham said in a 
statement. 'This coward left the scene of the accident not even 
bothering to check on the people of the other car.'

The Glaubers had been heading to 
hospital in a taxi early on Sunday morning after Raizi, who was seven 
months pregnant, felt an unusual pain.

Nachman and Raizi were traveling in the
black 2008 Toyota Camry livery cab to Long Island College Hospital in 
Cobble Hill when a BMW smashed into the car and fatally injured the 
would-be parents.

The Glaubers both were pronounced dead 
at hospitals, and the medical examiner said they died of blunt-force 
trauma. It's not clear if they were wearing seatbelts.

The cause of the crash remained under
investigation on Monday. The driver of the BMW was expected at least to
face charges of leaving the scene of an accident.

The
livery car, which the Glaubers had called as they did not have their 
own vehicle, was at a stop sign, but it was unclear if it had stopped, 
police said.

The taxi driver, Pedro Nunez Delacruz, 32, was not injured in the crash. He had an up-to-date license but an application to use the Toyota as a livery cab was still pending at the time of the crash.

This means it should not have been sent to collect them, according to the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission, but his union insisted he had done nothing wrong.

In New York City, yellow taxis are 
hailed on the street, but residents may call car services, and are 
picked up by drivers in everyday vehicles.

Meanwhile, police said the registered 
owner of the BMW, Takia Walker, 29 who was not in the car, was charged 
with insurance fraud on Sunday in a scam involving the car.

A
person familiar with the investigation said Walker bought the car 
legally - or willingly used her identification for the purchase - then 
gave the car to another man. The middleman wasn't driving at the time of
the accident, and had either lent or rented the car out to the driver, 
the person said.

Deadly: Acevedo was allegedly driving this BMW when it smashed into the taxi carrying the Glaubers

Scene: Police still do not know the cause of the crash but believe Acevedo was travelling at 60 mph

A spokesman for the Orthodox Jewish community described the couple's death as 'a tragedy beyond (belief) just coming off a joyous holiday as Purim' as they were getting ready to welcome their first child

The impact from the t-bone smash sent
Raizi out into the street where her body came to rest under a trailer, 
while first responders had to cut the roof off the taxi to rescue 
Nachman and the taxi driver.

Both the Glaubers were pronounced dead at hospital. The
couple's child was born by C-Section at Bellevue Hospital in 
Manhattan, and had been in critical condition before his tragic passing.

Doctors had delivered the baby by 
cesarean section. Neighbors and friends said the boy weighed only about 2
pounds.

Ellen Borakove, spokeswoman for the 
city medical examiner's office, said the baby's death was caused by 
extreme prematurity due to maternal blunt force injuries.

Paramedic Yisroel Altman 
said he initially believed both husband and wife could survive, but 
their head injuries were just too much.

Missed: A person walks towards the graves of Nathan and Raizy Glauber at the Satmar Cemetery. In keeping with the Jewish tradition of holding a burial as soon as possible, they were buried on Sunday

'I’ve
seen worse cases [car accidents], it was the knock on the head that 
killed them,' said Altman to the New York Post, adding that Raizi was 
responsive in the ambulance until a few minutes before she arrived at 
Bellevue.

Jewish law calls for the burial of 
the dead as soon as possible and at least 1,000 people gathered at Yetev
Lev D'Satmar synagogue in Brooklyn on Sunday to pay their respects to the 
Glaubers.

The sound of wailing filled the 
street as the two black-draped coffins were carried from a vehicle.

There will not be a similar funeral 
for the baby boy; Hasidim do not perform funerals for newborns who do 
not survive 30 days, according to Mendel Rosenberg, of Chesed Shel Emes.

Heartbroken: The Glaubers were mourned at an emotional funeral hours after their deaths on Sunday

Missed: The young Orthodox Jewish couple, both 21, both died of blunt force trauma from the crash

Mourning: Rabbi Zalman Teitelbau, leader of the Satmar Orthodox Jewish community, speaks during the funerals in Brooklyn on Sunday, surrounded by members of the community

The baby was placed in a tiny coffin 
and buried early on Monday afternoon in a separate area of the cemetery 
in Kiryas Joel where his parents were laid to rest Sunday.

At the funeral on Sunday Rabbi Zalman Leib Teitelbaum addressed the mourners in Yiddish.

'It's
a great tragedy for the community,' said Teitelbaum. 'We have to hold 
on together and see what we can do to make things better. This is a 
very, very big tragedy.'

Raizi's brother, Yitzchak Silberstein, spoke of his devastation at his sister's tragic passing to the New York Daily News.

'She was the crown of the family,' said Silberstein. 'We were sitting together last night and today she’s gone.'

The young couple were in this livery cab when they were involved in the crash

He
was full of praise for his brother-in-law too. 'We can all learn from 
him how to treat a wife,' he said. 'The way he treated her was special.'

The funerals took place in Brooklyn, which is home to the largest 
community of ultra-orthodox Jews outside Israel, more than 250,000.

The Glaubers were married about a 
year ago and had begun a life together in Williamsburg, where Raizi 
Glauber grew up in a prominent Orthodox Jewish rabbinical family, Sara 
Glauber said.

Raised north of New York City in 
Monsey, N.Y., and part of a family that founded a line of clothing for 
Orthodox Jews, Nachman Glauber was studying at a rabbinical college 
nearby, said his cousin.
