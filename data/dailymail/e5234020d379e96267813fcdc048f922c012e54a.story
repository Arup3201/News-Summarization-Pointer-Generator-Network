A falconer is so obsessed with birds of prey that he now soars through the sky with them by parachuting and hang gliding through the air.

Jonathan Marshall, who has reared the hunters all of his life, flies across the Devon coastline near his home whenever the conditions are right but admits to being jealous of his Harris Hawk and Peregrine Falcon who can fly whenever they please.

Along with learning how to fly, he has also taught Samson - a nine-year-old Golden Eagle who he rescued - how to take to the skies.

Jonathan Marshall, a falconer, is so obsessed with birds of prey that he now soars through the sky with them by parachuting and hang gliding through the air

Mr Marshall, who has reared the hunters all of his life, now soars across the Devon coastline near his home whenever the conditions are right but admits to being jealous of his Harris Hawk and Peregrine Falcon who can fly whenever they please

Mr Marshall, who trains the birds on his pet horse Tulio, said: 'The paragliding and the hang gliding give you the ability to experience what it's like to fly like the birds.

'They have a perfect design which has evolved over millions of years - they just stick their wings out and they have everything they need.

'Sometimes when I try to fly the wind does not work for me and I reckon the birds have a laugh at me.

'I reckon they think what the hell are you waiting for but as humans we are stuck on the floor.Â 

Mr Marshall, who trains the birds on his pet horse Tulio, said: 'The paragliding and the hand gliding give you the ability to experience what it's like to fly like the birds'

Mr Marshall, who lives with his partner and two children, added: 'I think I'm incredibly lucky to share my life with these beautiful creatures. 'When I see them soaring on a nice day I get a lump in my throat and often feel quite emotional'

Top speed of eagle flying: When hunting the bird can reach speeds of up to 190 km/h (120 mph)

Top of man hang gliding: Speeds of 30 mph are normally considered 'fast' in the sport

How far an eagle can fly: As far as their wings can carry them - on average can fly (123km) 77 miles in a day

How far man can hang glide: The UK record for distance currently stands at 277km (172 miles)

Weather an eagle can fly in: All weather

Weather man needs to fly: Rain, low cloud and strong winds (more than 30mph) will make hang gliding unsafe

'We get some wonderful views of the cliffs and the countryside but it's even nicer and prettier when you're up there.

'Some times the winds blow in the right direction but they can still be a bit strong or too weak.

'Not for the birds - everything is perfect for them but for me I usually have to wait for the right conditions.

'My birds love it when it's windy but sometimes it's just the birds that get to fly and I'm left on the ground feeling left out.'

When the wind gets too strong Mr Marshall has to put away Crouch the Harris Hawk and bring out his Peregrine Falcon - Morgan.

Mr Marshall added: 'If it's blowing a howling gale then I bring out Morgan.

'Nothing can fly like a Peregrine Falcon in the wind.

'I love to fly but looking at him makes me feel like picking up my stuff and going home because for him it's just easy.'

Mr Marshall admits that many people will find his pets strange adding: 'There has to be a lot of trust. Particularly between Samson the Golden Eagle and me.

'He is a big bird at nearly a metre tall but he also knows when someone is gentle. He was abandoned and found in a wardrobe in Yorkshire after he spent around four months in there.

'He had plucked out all of his own feathers and was close to death when I got him. He couldn't fly so I took him up on to the cliffs in north Devon.

'He looked really nervous - like a child on rollerskates but he eventually picked it up.'

Mr Marshall, who lives with his partner and two children, added: 'I think I'm incredibly lucky to share my life with these beautiful creatures.

'When I see them soaring on a nice day I get a lump in my throat and often feel quite emotional.

'But all the time and effort I have put into them over the years they give back over and over.

Mr Marshall's story is one of several which features in new Animal Planet series Preposterous Pets, which continues on Thursday April 17th at 8pm.
