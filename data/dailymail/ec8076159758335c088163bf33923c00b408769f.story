A Florida church that hosted naked paint parties and slumber-party Sundays featuring the 'sexiest ladies on the beach' has lost its tax-exempt status.

The News Herald of Panama City reports The Life Center: A Spiritual Community has been operating a seven-day-a-week party called Amnesia: The Tabernacle since February 28 as thousands of college students arrived in the Florida town for the spring break season.

A sign on the door says events are alcohol and drug free, but Sheriff Frank McKeithen calls the party atmosphere a 'blatant slap in the face' to taxpayers. He says church officials are 'trying to get around the laws.

A Panama Beach City, Florida church has lost its tax-exempt status as police investigate the parties held nightly at the religious building for college students on spring break

The company that organizes the events at the Life Center church (called the Tabernacle for parties) says they are completely drug and alcohol free. Above, a view inside The Tabernacle on Saturday

Patrons are charged a 'donation' of $20 at the door. On the walls inside are T-shirts emblazoned with obscene gestures and signs that say 'I hate being sober.'

Additionally, Amnesia was staying open until 5am thanks to its church status, which is not under the city ordinance that clubs and bars close at 2am.

This led Property Appraiser Dan Sowell to change the tax exempt status.

'A bottle club, charging $20 at the door and selling obscene T-shirts is not being used as a church,' Sowell said. 'A God-fearing, God-honoring church in January does not sponsor this type of debauchery in March.'

Mark Q Bishop, the former pastor at Faith Christian Family Church, is the owner of the building.

In 2004, Bishop was hit with another tax issue when county officials challenged him listing his 10,000-square-foot house as tax-exempt as a parsonage. The rulings were mostly in favor of Bishop, but he has allagedly changed the tax status of the property.

The issue for authorities isn't so much the parties themselves, but the fact that the church continues to not pay property taxes as a religious buildings despite holding several club-like events . Above, the line to get into Tabernacle on Tuesday

SpringBreakAmnesia.com, the website for the company that organizes the events at Tabernacle, briefly took down their website in the aftermath of the tax decision.

But on Tuesday, the site was back up and running with some of the more explicit t-shirts taken down and the descriptions of the parties tamed down.

They also posted a statement which reads: 'The Tabernacle is a drug and alcohol free community for the youth to go for spring break at night to interact with each other in a fun safe environment,'

'iDrink sponsors this community reach out program with their non-alcoholic bottled water product only. We thank all of our patrons that have attended and will be attending our safe environment.'
