Kremlin president Vladimir Putin today demanded visa-free travel between Russia and all EU countries including Britain as the price of an oil-fuelled rouble boost for Europe.

He wants governments all over the continent to tear down their strict entry requirements for Russians, and says he will do the same in return. 

With up to 400,000 Russians already in Britain, the fear of such a policy is a flood of new employment and social security migrants,  and the arrival of criminal and mafia elements as well as spies. 

Tough talks: Russian President Vladimir Putin (C), European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso (L) and President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy (R) pose during an EU-Russia summit in Strelna, outside St. Petersburg

But the Moscow strongman - back in the Kremlin hot seat after a four year absence - rammed home the message at an EU summit in St Petersburg that he sees this goal as an essential pre-requisite of closer co-operation and the opening of the lucrative Russian market. 

He called on Britain and other EU countries to shed their 'stereotypes' and ideological prejudices concerning Moscow and instead adopt a 'pragmatic, businesslike approach'.

'A true partnership is impossible when there is a visa barrier,' he said at the start of the talks with European Council President Herman Van Rompuy and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.

He taunted Britain over fears of a criminal influx by implying it has already given a safe haven to those wanted for crimes in Russia. 

He has a major gripe with London over political asylum and residency  given to dozens of Russians he regards as money launderers, embezzlers, crime kings and even terrorists. 

'I believe the fears about an inflow of labour migrants from Russia are exaggerated,' he said.

'The criminal elements who want to go to Europe, they all are already there. And they are travelling back and forwards without any visas using their own instruments.'

Demands: Putin called for a 'pragmatic, businesslike approach without any ideological or other stereotypes', a veiled warning to the EU to treat Russia as an equal and steer clear of preaching on political issues

Russia and the EU are deeply intertwined, with Europe relying heavily on Russian energy exports and Russia buying EU products from German cars to Italian olive oil and Scandinavian furniture for the middle class         

Moscow has blunted Western efforts to condemn Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and push him from power during 15 months of bloodshed Western nations blame on his government, whose forces have killed at least 9,000 people.

Both Russia and Europe say they still support Kofi Annan's U.N.-backed peace plan, but EU nations would like Russia to press Assad harder to abide by a ceasefire demanded by the plan.       

EU foreign policy chief Catherine Aston said on Sunday that the crisis had reached a 'critical point' and that Russia's role was 'crucial.'

Russia says it is not protecting Assad, who has given Moscow its firmest Middle East foothold, but that the Syrian leader's exit cannot be a precondition for political dialogue.

Putin ceded no ground on Syria in remarks during visits to Berlin and Paris on Friday, placing an accent on rebel violence, criticising sanctions and saying political decisions could not be forced upon the country from outside.               

Ashton, who met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Sunday, said the EU wanted to 'work closely with Russia to find a way to end the violence' and that 'Russia's role is crucial for the success of Annan's plan'.           

The statement said she and Anan agreed the crisis had reached a 'critical point'.        

However, when asked whether he expected the summit to narrow the gap on Syria, Lavrov told reporters: 'I don't think so.'

He claimed the main visa curbs hit 
'lawful businessmen, reporters, and those who would like to support 
personal relations with their friends and relatives in European 
countries or in Russia'.

In a swipe at France and Germany, he 
claimed visas issued to his travelling media corps last week were for 
one day only which meant that when his Berlin press conference overran 
and midnight approached, journalists risked becoming overstaying 
illegally in the EU.

'Their visas were under threat of running out. Were they supposed to stand up and leave? he asked. 

Diplomats saw his new demand as part 
of a new uncompromising approach in negotiating with the West which 
badly needs an economic boost from Russia. 

A British source said: 'The Russians 
are piling on pressure on visas but there is no way we can allow open 
entry. If it would happen tomorrow we could imagine an influx of people 
arriving to immediately claim asylum from Putin's regime.'

It is only two months since warnings 
were sounded over the rising level of Russian spying in Britain, with 
one estimate suggesting at least 40 agents operate in the country at any
one time. 

Yet pressure is also likely from the 
EU where Van Rompuy calls visa-free travel a 'common goal' and Antonio 
Tajani, the European Commissioner responsible for tourism, is in favour 
of a massive easing of visa curbs on Russians. 

'Of course it's important to work for
security, but at the same time our economy is very important,' he said 
earlier this year.
