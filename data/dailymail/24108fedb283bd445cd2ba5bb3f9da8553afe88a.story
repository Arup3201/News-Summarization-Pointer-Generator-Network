Dead: Shele Danishefsky Covlin was found dead in her bath tub on New Year's Eve 2009

The husband of a wealthy UBS executive accused of her murder has been blocked from gaining further access to the $1.6million life-insurance-policy payout she left for their children.

Shele Danishefsky Covlin, 47, was found dead in the bathtub at her Manhattan apartment by her daughter with a large cut to her head on New Year's Eve 2009.

Though her death was ruled an accidental falling at the time, her body was later exhumed and a medical examiner said in July 2010 she had been strangled.

Today it emerged her husband Rod Covlin filed papers in Westchester County Surrogate’s Court in April asking to be named guardian of the cashed-in Aetna policy that his wife had left for their children Anna, 11, and Myles, five.

Court papers state Covlin wrote: 'I am Anna’s father, I have her best interests at heart, and I am in the best 
position to determine her current and future needs.'

Today, Westchester County Surrogate’s 
Court Judge Anthony Scarpino temporarily stripped him of the right to 
control the account.

The order will remain in place until 
at least next Wednesday, when an emergency hearing is scheduled to 
review the circumstances surrounding how he obtained access to the the 
money.

A source told The New York Post Covlin had been listed as the beneficiary of the insurance policy but Shele changed it to her children four weeks before she died.

Covlin’s bid was successful and he filed a similar petition to control Myles’ half of the payout.

Although both children stand to inherit the money when they are 18, the 39-year-old does have the power to invest and can apply for the court to withdraw cash.

Court papers show Colvin left blank the answer to a question about whether the children's custody had ever been the subject of a court order.

He also failed to divulge that an order of protection had been filed against him before and after his wife’s murder, allowing him only supervised visits with the pair.

And the unemployed father wrote 'n/a' under a question asking for the name and address of the children's maternal grandfather and grandmother, who have been fighting to keep him from getting their daughter’s money in a separate court case.

It emerged yesterday the Manhattan public administrator has filed a wrongful death civil lawsuit against Roderick Covlin, a former stock trader, according to the New York Post.

Mrs Covlin's Orthodox Jewish family refused an autopsy at the time and she was buried immediately, following religious tradition.

But when the district attorney's office looked into the case, they learned  she had scheduled a meeting with her lawyer to remove her ex-husband from her will.

Scene: Her body was found in the bath tub of her apartment in the Upper West Side of Manhattan

According to the Post, a suit has been
filed in Manhattan Supreme Court by Public Administrator Ethel Griffin,
a little-known county official who handles estate complications.

The
suit charges that Covlin 'intentionally, deliberately, willfully, 
wantonly, maliciously, brutally and without provocation or just cause 
did strangle, choke, strike, injure, assault, abuse, beat and murder' 
his wife.

Mrs Covlin left an estate of at least $1million which her husband is to split 50-50 with their two children Anna and Myles.

A judge appointed the public administrator as executor at the time and she is now seeking to stop Mr Covlin from taking half of his wife's assets.

There is still an active criminal investigation in the case.

Covlin lives in Westchester County with his children. Shele’s brother Philip Danishefsky is seeking custody of the kids.

If he is indicted and found guilty of
killing his wife, he will lose his share of her estate, all of which 
would go to the children.

He has never been arrested or charged in her death.

At the time of her death, the unemployed Covlin was living across the hall from his former wife and their daughter and son, all of whom had an order of protection against him.

After the daughter found Shele in the bathroom, she went to get her dad and let him in the apartment.

Sources told The Post that in the aftermath of Shele’s death, her purse and smart-phone went missing. Both contained her schedule for meetings with a lawyer to discuss removing Rod from her will.
