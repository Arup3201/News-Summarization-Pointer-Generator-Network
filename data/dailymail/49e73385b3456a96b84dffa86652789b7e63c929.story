Car owners could be traced and fined for litter seen thrown from their vehicles under new plans

The sight of cigarette butts, crisp packets 
and other kinds of litter being thrown out of car windows is a sadly 
familiar one.

But under tough new plans to clampdown 
on litterbugs, car owners could be traced and fined up to £80 for any rubbish thrown 
from their vehicle - whether they were driving at the time or not.

Bringing those responsible for littering from cars to justice is currently a tall order for councils who often struggle to prove who the perpetrator was.

If introduced, the new proposals - 
tabled in the House of Lords - will enable them to pursue vehicle owners who can then be handed a penalty or required to name the person responsible.

They will be liable even if they have no idea who threw the rubbish.

Britain
currently has some of the most rubbish-strewn roads in Europe, which
councils in England alone spend more than £860 million a year to clear up.

Last year, nine million drivers threw 
litter from their cars.

Lord
Marlesford has introduced a Private Member’s Bill to get the law changed 
so that councils can try to recoup some of the cash they spend cleaning up litter by issuing fines directly to
car owners.

He also wants councils to report to the public each year on how much they have spent 
on contracts for clearing rubbish and which streets they clean in order to make the process more 
accountable.

The public would then be able to complain direct to councils and contractors if their streets were still dirty.

The plans have been backed by Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman.

CCTV cameras could be used by councils to enforce the new law, while fines would also be issued by Civil Enforcement Officers.

Councils in London already issue £100 for 
littering from cars but this could be extended to the rest of England.

Littering is a criminal offence which can lead to a fine of £2,500 if taken to court.

Councils also hand out fixed 
penalty notices of up to £80 to those caught dropping rubbish in the street.

'Nothing degrades a road more than litter,' Lord Marlesford told the Telegraph.

'The roads in England are some of the dirtiest in Europe. And it can so easily be dealt with.'

American author Bill Bryson, a former president of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, last month described the country's roads as 'an informal linear tip.'

The AA has also welcomed the bill which Lord Marlesford hopes will be adopted and brought into law as quickly as possible.

He told the Telegraph, 'I want action, not words.'
