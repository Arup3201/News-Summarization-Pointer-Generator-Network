A suburban Philadelphia woman from Norristown, Pa. has been banned from using Twitter as part of her sentence for a stalking conviction on Wednesday.

Montgomery County Judge William Carpenter barred 34-year-old Sadiyyah Young of Pottstown from tweeting for at least five years.

Authorities say Young used derogatory and harassing tweets against people involved in a custody case regarding her children, including a judge who ruled against her, lawyers, social workers and foster parents.

Young's threatening tweets included the addresses of social workers and of a county judge

'I canâ€™t imagine this is the first time this has ever happened, but it just felt like it was an appropriate remedy to punish her for what she did,' District Attorney Matthew Quigg told CBS Philly.

Quigg says Young tweeted the home address of social workers and of a county judge. Court records also show that Young faked her identity in order to file complaints against the judge assigned to her case.

The month long battle included a tweet that read, in part: 'Somebody should pay all these people a visit, bust out windows and cut tires!'

Young pleaded guilty Wednesday to misdemeanor charges of stalking, forgery, and identity theft. She also was sentenced to 11 1/2 months to 23 months in jail and three years' probation.

Assistant District Attorney Matthew Quigg said Young's tweets were threatening and gave out too much personal information of people involved in the custody battle over her children
