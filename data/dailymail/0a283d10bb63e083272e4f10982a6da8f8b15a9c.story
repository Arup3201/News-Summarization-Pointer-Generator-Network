Gerald 'Skip' Murphy, 38, was shot after holding his girlfriend's three children hostage for three days

Police stormed a New Jersey home early on Sunday and fatally shot a registered sex offender who had held his girlfriend's three children hostage, ending their 37-hour ordeal and recovering the bodies of the captives' mother and another sibling, authorities said.

Officers initially went to the home in South Trenton on Friday afternoon after a relative of 44-year-old Carmelita Stevens said she hadn't spoken to her in weeks and was worried, authorities said at a news conference today.

Upon further investigation, authorities then discovered her children hadn't been to school in 12 days.

Police entered the home through a 
rear door and smelled an odor consistent with that of a decomposing 
body, Trenton Police Director Ralph Rivera Jr said. The officers also 
noticed maggots throughout the residence.

They found 38-year-old Gerald 'Skip' 
Tyrone Murphy in an upstairs bedroom and he told them he was armed with a
gun and explosives and had three children with him, Mercer County 
Prosecutor Joseph L. Bocchini Jr said.

Officers noticed one of the dead 
victims before they retreated from the second floor and rescued Stevens'
19-year-old son from the basement, who said he hadn't seen her or his 
siblings since about April 24.

Pushed out: Residents from Grand Street in South Trenton were evacuated and waited in fear for the standoff's ultimate conclusion

Armed: SWAT police personnel stand guard outside the South Trenton home where a man held several children hostage, having killed their mother and 13-year-old brother

Homes on the surrounding block were evacuated as a precaution, and police tape cordoned off the street in front of the house.

A SWAT team was called, and an arson 
bomb unit was also on the scene. Police said Murphy could be seen from a
window holding a black handgun.

Police remained in contact with 
Murphy throughout the standoff and passed food into the home through an 
upstairs window, state police Col Rick Fuentes said.

Murphy kept the captives with him inside the roughly 10-foot-by-11-foot bedroom throughout the standoff, authorities said.

As the standoff stretched into a 
third day, officers entered the home around 3:45am on Sunday after 
noting Murphy's 'deteriorating state of mind' and deciding it was 
necessary to enter to help ensure the captives survived, Fuentes said.

An officer shot Murphy because he was threatening one of the children, he said.

Murphy was taken to a hospital and 
later died of his injuries. No law enforcement personnel were injured 
during the standoff or the confrontation with Murphy.

'This was a very complex matter, 
considering the space (where the hostages were) and that three children 
were involved,' Fuentes said. 'Our mission over those 37 hours was to 
save innocent lives.'

Authorities found the bodies of 
Stevens and her 13-year-old son in separate bedrooms. Stevens' body was 
in an advanced state of decomposition, and police said she and her son 
may have been killed two weeks ago.

Police didn't say which of the bodies they had seen inside the home Friday afternoon.

Three of Stevens' children - an 
18-year-old woman, a 16-year-old girl and a four-year-old boy - were 
rescued and taken to a medical center for evaluation and treatment.

Murphy had abused and assaulted the captives, Bocchini said.

Evacuated: Police evacuated the area and used flash bombs to secure the home, firing a single shot at the suspect before paramedics were called

Murphy and Stevens had been dating 
for a few months, and both lived in the house, police said. He was not 
the father of any of her children.

Authorities wouldn't comment on a 
possible motive or say how the victims died, citing the ongoing 
investigation. They also would not say whether any bombs or other 
explosives were recovered at the residence.

Attempts to contact the victims' relatives and neighbors were unsuccessful on Sunday.

Murphy had a long criminal history including convictions for aggravated assault and criminal conspiracy, Bocchini said.

He had previously been arrested for 
robbery and weapons offenses and child endangerment. He also had an 
arrest warrant in Pennsylvania for failing to register as a sex 
offender.

On
Saturday, family members of a woman they said was among the hostages 
grew angry, with some of them going under police tape and briefly 
confronting officers about the situation.

'Do something! Do something!' screamed a man who said he was the woman's nephew. 'Make something happen!'

Police presence: Police were first called Friday afternoon, when they entered the home and found the mother Carmelita Stevenson and her 13-year-old son dead

Watching & Waiting: New Jersey police officers stood guard on a street in Trenton, New Jersey. The gunman held two teen girls and a 4-year-old boy along with the dead mother and son

Drawn out: Police were called just before 3pm on Friday and were still in position early on Saturday morning until the ultimate conclusion early Sunday

Tense: Negotiations continued, but top no avail and police eventually chose to enter the home

Shock: Neighbours were stunned by the news that a woman and her child had been shot. The couple had moved to the neighbourhood just four months ago
