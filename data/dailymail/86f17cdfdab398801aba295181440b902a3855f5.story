Neil Lennon’s four-year reign as Celtic manager is over.

The Northern Irishman has opted to cut his ties with the Parkhead club with a brief statement on Thursday afternoon.

He said: 'I have parted company with Celtic. The club are in a very strong position and I wish the fans and the club all the very best for the future.

Going out on a high: Neil Lennon has ended his four-year reign as Celtic manager

'I can't thank Peter Lawwell and the board enough for their backing and support during my time as manager.'

'I have supported Celtic all my life and the Club will always be part of me. It was an absolute honour to play for this great Club, to captain the team and of course to become Celtic Manager, a position which I cherished dearly. However, I feel the time is now right to move on to a new challenge.

'Of course, I am very pleased that I will be leaving Celtic as Scottish Champions and with the Club in such good health. I wish the Club nothing but good fortune going forward.

'I would like to send my sincere thanks and best wishes to Johan Mjallby and Garry Parker who have supported me magnificently, to all the players and staff at the Club who I have worked with over so many years and, of course, to our magnificent supporters who have been with me through everything. I would also like to thank Dermot, Peter and the Club’s Board of Directors for their support.'

Grateful: Lennon thanked all of his Celtic players as well as the 'magnificent' supporters

'I also want to thank my family for all they have given me. I could not have been Celtic Manager for four years without their wonderful support.

'Serving the Club was always a privilege. I have always given my best and aimed to do all I can to ensure success for Celtic, as a supporter it was all I wanted.

'I will now assist the Club in appointing my successor. As ever, we will need our fans’ support and I am sure they will give the Club and the new Manager the same great backing which they gave to myself.'

And the man the Scottish champions want to replace him is former Parkhead defender Malky Mackay.

Lennon’s stint in charge is now history with only the formalities left to be tied up.

Since taking control in 2010 the Northern Irishman has won three Scottish Premiership titles, two Scottish Cups and taken the club to the last 16 of the Champions League after toppling Barcelona.

Returning hero? Henrik Larsson has been installed as favourite to become new boss

Keen to test himself in English football, however, his resignation offers the 42-year-old the freedom to speak to other clubs without seeking permission from Parkhead powerbrokers.

Speculation has surrounded the future of the former club captain for some time.

Concerned Celtic plan to sell the key duo Virgil van Dijk and Fraser Forster this summer, the issue came to a head amidst concerns that qualification for the Champions League is becoming more and more difficult.

Aside from facing three qualifiers to make the group stages, Celtic will have to play those games at Murrayfield due to Celtic Park being used for the Commonwealth Games – putting them at a distinct disadvantage.

The recent departure of trusted deputy Johan Mjallby has also persuaded Lennon that this is the right time to move on.

Lennon has been heavily linked with a move to managerless Norwich City, but has been hamstrung by the need for the Carrow Road club to seek permission to speak to him. That path has now been cleared.

On Wednesday night bookmakers Paddy Power suddenly slashed the odds on Henrik Larsson – currently in charge of Swedish club Falkenbergs - becoming the new manager.

Former Celtic defender and Cardiff City boss Mackay met Carrow Road directors last Thursday and is favourite for the job. Mackay, however, also tops Celtic’s list for a potential replacement for Lennon.

Sportsmail has learned that a Celtic representative has already made informal contact with a member of the Mackay camp to establish if he would consider a return to his native Glasgow.

Mackay holds the club in huge regard and has ambitions to manage at Parkhead one day – but has ambitions to return to management in the English Premiership sooner rather than later.

David Moyes, recently sacked by Manchester United, is free to consider a return to his first love but that option seems unlikely.

Steve Clarke, the former West Brom manager, is also in the mix together with ex Swansea deputy Morten Weighorst.

Jackie McNamara, the Dundee United manager, would be a popular choice with supporters although the acrimonious nature of his departure in 2005 might count against him.

Whoever is appointed the next Celtic manager has a tough act to follow.

Lennon served Celtic as a player between 2000 and 2007 before returning as first team coach the following season.

He was demoted to reserve team manager after Gordon Strachan made way for Tony Mowbray but was asked to take charge of the team after the latter was shown the door after an inglorious spell in charge.

After being given the job on a permanent basis in 2010, Lennon built his own side by snapping up the likes of Gary Hooper, Fraser Forster and Joe Ledley.

His side narrowly missed out to Rangers in the 2010-11 SPL yet defeated Motherwell to win the Scottish Cup that season.

The following season, Lennon, boosted by the acquisition of Victor Wanyama, finally got his hands on the title and the following term his men took the scalp of Barcelona as they qualified for the last 16 of the Champions League.

Successive league titles were added last year and this – together with another Scottish Cup in 2013 and another Champions League qualification last year.

But facing the likelihood of losing Forster and Van Dijk this summer, Lennon has now opted to hand the task of rebuilding the squad to someone else.

Former Celtic winger Aiden McGeady 
has warned whoever succeeds Neil Lennon as manager will have to win two 
trophies a year if he wants to be considered a success.

The
 Republic of Ireland international, who played both with and under 
Lennon during his time at Parkhead, knows the new incumbent faces a 
tough task.

Asked how much 
of a blow the Ulsterman's departure was to the club, the Everton winger 
said: 'It's a big blow. Now Celtic will obviously be looking to replace 
him with someone, but the big question is who do you replace him with?

'That's the first question, which candidates are out there? You start looking straight away.

'It
 will be a difficult job because Celtic is a massive club and success is
 a way of life, you have to go and win every game, you have to go and 
win every trophy you compete in, apart from the Champions League.

'If you are not winning two trophies a year, you are seen as a failure.'

Warning: Everton wideman Aiden McGeady believes the next Celtic manager will need to win two trophies a season to be considered a success

McGeady, however, admitted the news did not exactly come as a shock, even if the timing of it may have done.

The 28-year-old said: 'To be honest, it's not really come as a surprise because of some things I've heard from a few people, that he was a bit unsettled and had probably kind of done all he thought he could do with the club and maybe was looking for a new challenge down in England somewhere.

'Maybe the Celtic fans wouldn't be shocked by it either, but obviously to just hear 10 minutes ago that he had resigned was a little bit of a shock in that sense.

'Ever since he took over at Celtic from when I was there, he was brilliant. I played with him - he was difficult at times to get on with as a player, but as a manager, I can't speak highly enough of him.

'He was fantastic when I was there and led the club to many trophies in the last four years.

'Maybe he just thinks it's time for himself to get down to England somewhere and have a new challenge.'

Meanwhile, another former Celtic winger, Davie Provan, says the absence of Rangers from the Scottish league cost Neil Lennon the chance of a top job in England.

Lennon has left without another job to go to and Provan says that’s an indication of how far Scottish football has fallen in the esteem of English chairmen.

'It’s fair to say the Celtic job no longer has the prestige it once had,' observes Provan.

'At the time Martin O’Neill and Dick Advocaat were going head to head and Rangers had players like Ronald do Boer and Henrik Larsson and Chris Sutton.

'The job does not have the cache it had then. I think Neil may feel that he has achieved all he possibly can in Scotland and has now hit the glass ceiling. It’ s time to move on.'
