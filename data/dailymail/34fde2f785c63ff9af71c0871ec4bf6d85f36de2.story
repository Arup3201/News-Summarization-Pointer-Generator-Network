Since the emergence of the militant jihadist Islamic State last summer the popularity of the name Isis has had an unsurprising nosedive.

The list of things unfortunate enough to share a name with the terrorist group known as ISIS include an Egyptian goddess, a dog on Downton Abbey - and a street in London. 

However, despite its unfortunate name, Isis Street in Earlsfield, South West London is lined with million-pound properties.

How unfortunate! Isis Street used to be associated with an Egyptian goddess, but now, the world knows ISIS as something completely different

Earlsfield, a residential area in the London borough of Wandsworth, is located on the fringes of an area nicknamed Nappy Valley due to its large population of affluent young families.

This in combination with the 12-minute train-ride to central London has contributed to property prices skyrocketing in recent years - even on Isis Street. 

A one-bedroom flat on Isis street sold for £365,000 three years ago, is now estimated to be worth £500,000, according to Zoopla.

A two-bedroom maisonette wold for £436,000 in August 2012, is now worth more than £605,000.

A house with four bedrooms a bit further down Isis Street was sold for £610,000 in 2007, but is now worth £1.09million.

As upper-middle as it gets: Isis Street in Earlsfield is located on the fringes of Nappy Valley in south London

Big money: Despite its unfortunate name, houses on Isis Street sell for up to £1million and a two-bed maisonette will set you back at least £500,000

You give love a bad name: Since the rise of the Islamic State in June, the word Isis has a bad ring to it

Since emergence of ISIS last year, the name now has other connotations

However, the rise of ISIS seems to have had little effect on Isis Street
