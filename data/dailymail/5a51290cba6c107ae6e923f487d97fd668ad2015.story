If you’re running low on fuel beware of filling up on the M42 because it charges drivers the ‘consistently highest’ motorway petrol prices in Britain, an exclusive new seven month study revealed.

Motorists on the M42 to the South and East of Birmingham in the West Midlands regularly face the most expensive unleaded costs, while those on the M61 in the North West of England face the highest prices for diesel.

Details emerged in new investigation for the Daily Mail by fuel experts PetrolPrices.com who tracked fuel prices at 133 motorway filling stations in the period from June until the end of December just as prices nationally were beginning to plummet.

Motorists on the M42  in the West Midlands regularly face the most expensive unleaded costs

It reveals that motorists forced to play the M-way lottery could be paying up to 18p more per litre of unleaded – or around £9 per fill-up - on these most expensive motorways than on the cheapest ones. For diesel the gap can widen to 20p adding £10 to a fill-up.

But compared to the average prices for unleaded fuel across the UK, the difference can be up to 23p per litre – or £11.50 per fill up. Drivers routinely pay up to 10p a litre more on average than off the motorway in a practice that ministers have condemned as ‘a rip-off’.

By contrast, the best-value motorway outlets are on the M65 in the North West of England and M8 in Scotland, where prices are often less than the national average for unleaded and diesel.

The detailed investigation follows the Government’s announcement of plans to force motorway filling stations to display their prices – and those of subsequent outlets – on giant roadside poles so motorists can choose whether to fill-up now or drive on to a cheaper outlet.

The PetrolPrices.com report does not name individual outlets, but highlights the costliest motorways as a whole.

It notes: ‘Every motorway with a service station was included, and the maximum and minimum price of standard unleaded and standard diesel was recorded, along with the price difference for these fuels between the most and least expensive outlets on each motorway.’

Drivers on the M61 in the North West of England face the highest prices for diesel, the study found

The figures show that, of the 26 motorway-class roads with service stations, the most expensive average price for unleaded petrol was found on the M42 which snakes around Birmingham in the Midlands.

It was the costliest in five of the seven months studied – with prices tracked at 142.4p per litre in June, 142.9p per litre in August, 146.9p in September, 134.9p in November and rising to 139.9p in December as prices nationally began to drop in line with falling oil prices. Ironically three nearby independent Harvest filling stations in the Birmingham and Worcestershire area were the first to smash the £1 barrier by selling unleaded at 99p a litre.

The most expensive spots were charging 18p per litre more for unleaded and 20p for diesel 

The M61, which runs between Manchester and Preston in the North West, was costliest for petrol in two of the months tracked - 142.9p in July and 142.9 in November.

:: Diesel was also dearest on the same two motorways – the M61 in five months from June to October inclusive when the price was static at 151.9p, and the M42 in the two months of November at 139.9p and December at 141.9p.

On Thursday the most expensive unleaded on the M42 cost 130.9p at a time when the average price cross the UK was 107.74p – a difference of 23.16p. The most expensive diesel on the M42 was 134.90 compared to a national average of 115.05p – a difference of 19.85p.

:: At the other end of the scale, the cheapest average price for unleaded petrol in four of the months surveyed was on the M65 near Preston, Blackburn and Burnley, and for the other three months on the M8 between Glasgow and Edinburgh.

The M65 was cheapest for unleaded in July (130.9p per litre), October (126.9p), November (123.9p) and December (119.9p) The M8 was cheapest for unleaded in June (129.9p), and in August and September (both 128.9p).

Diesel users found the best deals on the M65 in the five months of June (136.9p), July (135.9p), October (131.9p), November (128.9p), and December (125.9p), and on the M8 in the two months of August (133.9p) and October (131.9p). It concluded that overall the M65 and M8 motorways, as well as the M56 on Merseyside, were ‘consistently among the cheapest motorways’.

The report said the biggest gap between the most expensive and cheapest petrol stretched to 18p in September – the difference between 146.9p on the expensive M42 and 128.9p on the cheaper M8. That can make the difference of £9 to fill up the average family car.

The biggest gap between the most expensive and cheapest motorway diesel stretched to 20p in September and October – the difference between 131.9p on the cheapest M65 and 151.9p on the dearest M61. The report notes: ‘The fact that one of the dearest (M61) and cheapest (M65) motorways are linked suggests the location of a motorway is not the reason for price differences. And, of the least expensive motorways, one (M65) is in England while the other (M8) links Glasgow and Edinburgh.’

The best value motorway outlets were found on the M65 through Lancashire and the M8 in Scotland

The biggest price difference between the most and least expensive outlets on an individual motorway was 14p for unleaded on the M5. That was followed by 12p a litre for unleaded, found on both the A1(M) and M4 motorways. For diesel, the biggest difference between the most and least expensive outlets on an individual motorway was 13p per litre, also on the A1(M) and M4.

The differences mean drivers could save £6.00 on a single tank of unleaded and £6.50 on a tank of diesel leading to savings of hundreds of pounds a year.

Pete Zaborszky of PetrolPrices.com which tracks prices at more than 10,000 UK filling stations said: ‘There is clear evidence of motorway service stations exploiting the convenience factor for motorists. Most drivers fill up because they have to and may not realise there is cheaper fuel close by off the motorway.

‘What these figures show is that, even if you do buy your fuel on a motorway, you can save a small fortune simply by taking a few seconds to check where the best deals are. If you don’t seek out the best prices, you could be giving hundreds of pounds away needlessly every year.’

RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ‘It’s no wonder that motorists feel held to ransom with prices on the motorways inflated to such an extent. It is totally unacceptable.’

The Daily Mail photographed an Esso filling station on the M42 at Tamworth services selling unleaded at 130.9p a litre and diesel at 132.9p.

Some 30 miles to the South West on the ame M42, the Hopwood Park service area at Alvechurch near Redditch was selling Shell unleaded at 118.9p, some 12p cheaper. Diesel there was retailing at 125.9p, some 7p cheaper.

The average price across the UK, according to Experian Catalist was 107.46p for unleaded and 114.81 for diesel.

That means the Tamworth Esso filling station was selling unleaded at 23.44p per litre more than the average UK price – adding £11.72 to the average family car fill-up. It was selling diesel at 18.09 more than the average UK price, adding just over £9 to each fill up.

The Department for Transport begins work early next year trialling a new fuel-comparison sign at five service stations on the M5 between Bristol and Exeter, with a view to introducing them nationally by the end of 2015.

Transport Minister Robert Goodwill said: ‘For too long drivers have been ripped off by petrol prices on motorways.’
