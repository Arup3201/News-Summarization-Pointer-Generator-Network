Sixteen people in LA County are being monitored by doctors after fears they may have been exposed to the deadly Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS.

They all shared a flight with a man being treated for the disease in Florida, said CBS Los Angeles quoting the California Department of Public Health.

The disease emerged two years ago in Saudi Arabia and like its cousin, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), causes coughing, fever and sometimes fatal pneumonia.

Mystery: Scientists still have no idea how people are getting infected with MERS

More than 650 people worldwide have been infected with it, and MERS is reaching new victims every day in the Saudi kingdom, killing around 30 per cent of them.

Scientists say what stands out about the MERS virus is just how little the world knows about it, even though for almost two years it has been viewed as one of the top potential pandemic threats by a global network of specialists who keep tabs on all emerging viruses.

So far, much evidence points to camels as a possible infection source - with the virus staging a so-called zoonotic event by jumping from animals to people.

But scientists still have no idea how people are getting infected, whether by eating camel meat, or drinking the milk, touching blood or other body fluids, or simply being nearby when they cough or sneeze.

There is also no good data on how many people may be catching the virus but showing no or few symptoms, or how to successfully treat patients who get sick with MERS.

'There is so much missing in our knowledge of this infection after 20 months - whether it be the epidemiology, the transmission routes, the virology, or behavioural change,' said Jeremy Farrar, an infectious disease specialist and director of the Wellcome Trust international charity.Â
