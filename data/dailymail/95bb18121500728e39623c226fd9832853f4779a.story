HMV chief executive Trevor Moore has been made redundant just weeks after saying he was 'convinced' the chain's future could be secured

HMV boss Trevor Moore today became the latest casualty of another swathe of redundancies at the failed music chain.

Chief executive Mr Moore is one of 60 staff let go by administrators Deloitte across HMV's head office network at Eastcastle Street in London, Marlow and Solihull.

The job losses come on top of yesterday's announcement that 66 of its 220 shops are to close over the next two months, impacting 930 staff.

Mr Moore's exit comes weeks after he said he was 'convinced' the future of the chain could be secured.

On
the day HMV went into administration, he said bosses remained 
'passionate' about the retailer and would 'like to be involved in the 
business going forward if the opportunity presented itself'.

Talks
are continuing between Deloitte and restructuring firm Hilco - the 
group behind HMV Canada - which has already bought the company's debt.

But any rescue attempt will see HMV emerge as a far smaller business.

Nick
Edwards, joint administrator, said today's redundancies were a 
'difficult decision, but a necessary one in restructuring the business'.

'We would like to express our gratitude to staff for their continued support during the administration,' he added.

It comes after staff hijacked the firm’s Twitter account to post a blow-by-blow account
of mass sackings at head office.

Latest casualties: The HMV boss is just one of 60 staff from across the music chain's head office network to be let go

Angry staff gave live updates of the ‘mass execution’ at the beleaguered music firm’s London headquarters.

Around 190 workers both there and across its distribution centres were fired.

The incident triggered panic among HMV
executives who were seen marching around the office pleading for advice
on how to delete the tweets and shut down the @hmvtweets feed.

'Execution': Tweets from HMV's official account slammed the firing of 60 employees in one meeting recently

The first read: ‘We’re tweeting live 
from inside HR where we’re all being fired! Exciting!!’ One minute later
came the update: ‘There are over 60 of us being fired at once! Mass 
execution of loyal employees who love the brand.’

Poppy Rose Cleere, Online Marketing & Social Media Planner at HMV, was behind the tweets

Another followed: 
‘Just overheard our marketing director (he’s staying folks) ask “How do I
shut down twitter?”.’

One message, spread over two posts, 
read: ‘Under usual circumstances, we’d never dare do such a thing as 
this.

'However, when the company you dearly love is being ruined and 
those hard working individuals, who wanted to make HMV great again, have
mostly been fired, there seemed no other choice.’

The company managed to delete the tweets by mid-afternoon, however not before they had been re-tweeted thousands of times.

Poppy Rose Cleere, who described 
herself as HMV’s social media planner, said she was behind 
the tweets.

The 21-year-old said senior managers ‘never seemed to grasp’
the importance of social media.

‘I hope they’re finally listening,’ 
she said in a message from her personal account.

‘Since my internship 
started, I worked tirelessly to educate the business of the importance 
of social media – not as a short-term commercial tool, but as a tool to 
build and strengthen the customer relationship, and to gain invaluable 
real-time feedback from the consumers that have kept us going for over 
91 years.’

Staff at HMV, which employs more than 
4,000 people, have been afraid for their future since the chain went 
into administration last month.

Final stand: The rebellious tweets went on to say the firm was being 'ruined' so they had no other choice

HMV later deleted all its tweets then added these two tweets later, saying there have been job losses but 'not in our stores'
