The Baby of Cambridge may not be born yet, but he (or she) has already received his (or her) first musical dedication - a lullaby.

A composer who wrote a piece of music for Prince William and Kate Middleton's wedding has written a lullaby for their baby, due in July, to be sung by classical superstar Hayley Westenra.

Paul Mealor, who also wrote the chart-topping Wherever You Are for Gareth Malone's Military Wives choir, said he has written the tune Sleep On because it seemed a natural progression to accompany the next stage of their married life.

The Duchess of Cambridge, due to give birth in July, has had a lullby written for her baby by composer Paul Mealor, who also composed a piece of music for her wedding to Prince William

Paul Mealor also composed music - the song Ubi Caritas - for the wedding of Prince William to Kate Middleton

Westenra has included the song on a new album of lullabies and a copy is to be sent to the couple to help them through any sleepless nights with their new arrival, and she has dedicated the album to the royal baby.

Mealor, who also wrote the chart-topping Wherever You Are for the Military Wives choir, was commissioned to write Ubi Caritas for the wedding two years ago and was regarded as one of the musical highlights.

The 37-year-old said: 'After writing music for the Royal Wedding it seemed natural to provide the musical accompaniment for the next stage of the royal couple's journey together.'

Westenra's new album, called Hushabye, is designed to calm parents and children alike with calming tunes such as Hushabye Mountain and Twinkle Twinkle Little Star and is being released in June.

Westenra, who has performed for the Prince of Wales, said: 'Paul and I got together to work on a song called Sleep On in honour of William and Kate's new arrival as it's such a joyous occasion which we can all celebrate.'
