British travellers are deserting the beach in favour of seeking out more cultural holiday experiences, new research reveals.

Almost half of holidaymakers now describe themselves as 'culture vultures' and prefer delving into museums and historic sites rather than just lounging on the beach.

According to a new survey, trippers are heading to more off-the-beaten track destinations to explore local history and traditions thanks to the rising value of the pound, with Eastern Europe offering some of the best deals.

Warsaw Old Town: The cost of six cultural excursions in Poland's capital city costs just £69.95

The Cost of Culture report by Post Office Travel Money reveals tickets for national ballet and opera performances in Warsaw can be picked up for £20 thanks to a 13 per cent rise in sterling over the past five years.

Comparing a basket of six cultural items including a museum trip, visit to an art gallery and a classical concert, the Polish capital came out cheapest in a league of 12, costing just £69.65 in total.

Museum entry is around £2.82, while a night at the ballet or opera will set trippers back around £20.13 each.

The Hungarian capital of Budapest came out second cheapest with six cultural treats costing just over £80.

In third place is Prague at £92.59 followed by Dublin, Rome and Berlin.

The report comes as figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) show that last year 5,333,000 Britons went abroad on a break of one to three nights - spending around £1,635 million.

Rome is ranked as the fifth cheapest city on the list with visits to six cultural attractions costing £132.01

'With almost half of holidaymakers seeking a helping of culture while on a leisure break, it seems that people are now looking to add an extra dimension to their trips abroad', said Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money.

'The latest figures suggest that UK tourists are already spending many millions of pounds on short breaks abroad but culture vultures can cut their costs by doing their homework in advance and swapping to a city like Warsaw or Budapest where prices are significantly lower than better known cultural capitals like Paris or Amsterdam.'

The research shows it may even be cheaper to go abroad for a taste of culture with London coming out as the most expensive city.

London was the most expensive city with the total of six cultural trips costing £256.25

Although museum and art gallery entry is usually free, high costs of ballet and opera performances push the cultural basket price to more than £250.

A 23-per cent strengthening of the pound against the Czech koruna means a cultural trip to Prague costs around the same as it did in 2009.

Dublin and Rome emerge as best value for a cultural break in the Eurozone with prices in the Irish capital 19 per cent better than five years ago.

Going to see the ballet in Warsaw costs just over £20 while in London it can be in excess of £90

Mr Brown added: 'We based our report on the idea that people would want to visit galleries and museums every day on a short break and spend evenings at music-based events.

'What we found was that while every city surveyed boasts world-class cultural attractions, prices vary dramatically.

'This means culture vultures can save hundreds of pounds by doing their homework before booking and swap expensive cities for cheaper ones.'
