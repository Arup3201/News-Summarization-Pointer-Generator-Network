A woman has been left in a critical condition after she was charged at by a cow which rolled and sat on her.

Emma Moody was crossing a field in St Martin, Cornwall, when her dog disturbed a herd of cows and their young calves.

After the cow began to charge at her, a terrified Ms Moody attempted to run away but tripped and fell into its path.

Horror: A woman was airlifted to hospital after a cow charged at her before rolling and sitting on her. The accident happened in a field in St Martin, Cornwall. The village is pictured

The cow then trampled and rolled on her - breaking most of her ribs and leaving her with severe chest injuries.

A Navy search and rescue helicopter from nearby RNAS Culdrose was dispatched to the farm where crews found her lying badly hurt in a meadow.

She was airlifted to hospital where she today remains in a critical condition.

Ms Moody’s mother Sue said her daughter had done everything she could to stop her dog scaring the herd and had kept it on its leash.

She said: 'We feel the legislation needs looking at with regards to cows and young calves in fields where there is a public right of way.

'It’s not as if she was in a strange area or somewhere different where she didn’t know the farm or the walk

'We are eternally grateful for the speed she was taken to hospital and treated - it was second to none.'

The attack was revealed at a meeting of St Keverne Parish Council by Cornwall Councillor Walter Sanger.

He said: 'People, although they can be legally on the public footpath, have to be aware and be cautious where there are cattle and especially cattle with calves.'
