It is a busy photographer's hurriedly composed snapshot of a puppy-faced teenager in a Hollywood backstreet.

But this photograph was the very first step in Marilyn Monroe's journey to international superstardom. Now the original negative has been sold at auction for more than £3,000.

Joseph Jasgur took the picture of smiling Monroe, her then-brunette hair loose in soft curls, in March 1946. Weeks later he took her for what's regarded as her first modelling shoot, on California's Zuma Beach.

Fresh-faced: Joseph Jashur's very first hurried photograph of Marilyn Monroe, then a 19-year-old  factory girl called Norma Jean Dougherty, after she turned up at his studio and told him she wanted to be a model

Stripling: Another early picture of Monroe, this one by an unknown photographer, showing her light brown hair and slim but plump figure in a bikini on a California beach. It was taken in 1949

Transformation: This photograph by Laszlo Willinger, taken around the end of the 1940s and beginning of the 1950s, shows Monroe as she transformed into the blonde bombshell she became known as 

To those of us more used to seeing Monroe as a blonde bombshell in such Hollywood classics as Some Like It Hot and The Seven-Year Itch, this picture of the star is almost unrecognisable.

Jasgur was commissioned in 1946 by the Blue Book agency to take pictures of various aspiring models, among them a 19-year-old factory girl called Norma Jeane Dougherty.

Strapped for time when the aspiring model visited his studio in Hollywood, he photographed her on the run, in an alleyway behind Beverly Boulevard using a Rolleiflex camera.

Afterwards, the story goes, Monroe went to a nearby diner for a hamburger and fries.

Over the following weeks Jasgur snapped Marilyn in a number of locations, most famously on Zuma Beach in a swimsuit, before presenting the portfolio to Ben Lyon, casting director at 20th Century Fox, who signed the wannabe and turned her into Marilyn Monroe.

The pictures are believed to give the truest depiction of Monroe, who went on to become one of Hollywood's biggest stars and is still widely regarded to be one of the most-beautiful women to have ever lived.

Changes: Monroe photographed in bed in November 1961, aged 35, less than a year before her death

America's favourite: A still from a Pathé newsreel showing Monroe in South Korea, where she travelled in 1954 to appear in USO shows entertaining American troops after the Korean War ceasefire 

The auctioneer said the true value in the image sold yesterday lies in the fact that it is sold with the copyright to reproduce and distribute the image as the winning bidder wishes.

It was sold to a private collector for £3,100 in an auction at Henry Aldridge and Son in Devizes, Wiltshire, on Saturday, smashing the £2,000 pre-sale estimate.

Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge said: 'The image was taken on March 6, 1946 as part of some informal test shots that proceeded a formal shoot.

'This image is a true genesis as it is one of the first professional images ever taken of Marilyn.

'Jasgur first photographed her on a small street in West Hollywood behind Beverly Boulevard, where this image was taken.

'He didn't have time in his studio so went outside in the street. It is a very candid picture and she is looking very young with a bit of puppy fat still in her face.

'Over the next few weeks Jasgur photographed her on top of Don Lee Towers, above the Hollywood sign and at Zuma Beach.

'This photo offers a unique glimpse of the young girl who was to become the global phenomena that was Marilyn Monroe.'
