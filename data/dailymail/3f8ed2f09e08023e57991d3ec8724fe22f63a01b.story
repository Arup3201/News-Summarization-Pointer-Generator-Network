A California woman's road rage landed her in jail twice in just five days.

Deidre Orozco, 50, is back in Roseville Jail after she allegedly attempted to run two young women off I-80 just northeast of Sacramento on Saturday.

Days earlier, she had been arrested and released because of another hit-and-run accident.

The victims of Saturday's event filmed Orozco yelling and honking as she swerved her huge silver truck into the women's tiny Mazda.

At one point, the video shows Orozco pulling her car in front of the victims — forcing them to stop — and claiming to be a highway deputy.

One of the victims, passenger Delanie Strykul, says the incident started after Orozco cut them off twice, then slowed down to drive alongside their car.

'When she did that, I threw up my hands and flipped her off,' Strykul told CBS Sacramento. 

That got Orozco enraged, said the women, who 'feared for their lives.' 

'She pulls in front of us and then pulls her car horizontal and stops us,' Strykul told CBS.

The woman then gets out of her car and repeatedly knocks on Strykul's window, claiming to work in law enforcement. 

The young women manage to pull away — but Orozco gets back in the truck and begins to follow them, they said.

'She did the whole zig-zag in three lanes with her flashers on, kind of like what a police officer would do if they were trying to slow down traffic,' Strykul told CBS.

Orozco allegedly hit the women's car and tried to push them off the road, but they were able to get away again.

'We were so scared,' Strykul told CBS. 'If she had a gun it would have been way worse.'

They eventually called 911 and were told where a California Highway Patrol officer would be waiting for them.

Orozco followed them off the road and was arrested, CBS reported. She's charged with reckless driving, resisting arrest and assault with a deadly weapon.

Five days earlier, Orozco had been arrested for an alleged hit-and-run in nearby Roseville.

After the accident, police told the Auburn Journal, Orozco 'proceeded to drive to her relatives’ house where she threw rocks through the windows, vandalizing the home and issuing threats of bodily harm.'

Orozco is being held on $25,000 bond at Placer County Jail.
