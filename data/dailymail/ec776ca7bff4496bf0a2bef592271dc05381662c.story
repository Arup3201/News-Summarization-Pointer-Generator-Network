A schoolboy who suffered the worst brain injury 'medics had ever seen' has stunned doctors after waking from a two week coma.

Harry Davies, 11, was cycling home from school when he was knocked down by a car and thrown head first on to the road.

The pupil suffered a large six-inch fracture in his skull, despite wearing a bike helmet, which neurologists described as the worst head injury they'd ever seen.

Harry, from Pencaitland, East Lothian, in Scotland, was rushed to hospital where he was placed in a medically-induced coma on June 3 while doctors inserted a bolt in his skull to reduce the swelling of his brain.

But two weeks later, Harry amazed doctors when he woke up on Sunday and he is now sitting up, eating and drinking, and talking to friends and family. 

His mother Lisa, 46, said: 'He was knocked off his bike and hit his 
head. He had a six-inch crack in his skull and he had a fractured 
cheekbone. But it was the opposite side of the brain that was damaged 
because of the ricochet effect.

'The neurologist said he had not seen this level of trauma in the brain of a child before. He's been quite lucky and he's a fighter.'

The bolt, which Harry's parents say the schoolboy jokingly refers to as his 'Dalek bolt', will remain his head until his skull has almost fully healed.

Mrs Davies, who works for a mobile phone 
company said: 'After about a week we were told that they expected Harry to recover.

'He
was woken up from the coma after one week but he wasn't able to handle 
it, so doctors put him back to sleep for another week to let his brain 
recover. After that he woke up and was able to cope with it.

'He is really making progress. He's talking to people and
he recognises his family and friends. 'He's sitting up and is able to 
eat and drink. He is looking really well.'

His father Nick, 46, said added that he couldn't have wished for a better Father's Day present when his son woke up on Sunday.

Since waking, the schoolboy has made 
such a quick recovery he was even able to bypass the high-dependency 
unit at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh and go 
straight to a neurology ward.

His mother continued: 'He should have gone from intensive care to high dependency, but he's on the neurology ward.'

Harry had been cycling home with his 
best friend, 12-year-old Douglas Simpson, when he was struck by the car.
Douglas, who was on foot, was also hit but landed in a soft verge and 
escaped unharmed.

Harry was fortunate not to be killed outright - with doctors claiming his helmet is the only reason he survived.

Mrs Davies added: 'Medical staff told us that if Harry 
hadn't been wearing a helmet he would have died. He's always been very 
safety conscious and he wouldn't have got on a bike without a helmet.'

Police Scotland said they were continuing to appeal for witnesses over the incident.
