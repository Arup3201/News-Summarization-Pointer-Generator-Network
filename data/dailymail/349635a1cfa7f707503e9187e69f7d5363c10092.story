History will show Wayne Rooney to be a certain starter for any all-time Manchester United XI anyone cares to draw up. And whether people like it or not, he will edge Sir Geoff Hurst out of an all-time England XI to start up front alongside Gary Lineker in our traditional 4-4-2.

Rooney currently sits third in United’s all-time goalscorer list, behind Denis Law who played less games, and record holder Sir Bobby Charlton, who played far more games.

The Scouser is well on course to become the No 1. It should happen in the next couple of years, if Rooney’s return in recent seasons is anything to go by.

One of the best: Wayne Rooney stands on the brink of breaking records for club and country

Rooney has his detractors – as do Manchester United – but if and when he does sit proudly at the top of United’s list of all-time scorers, it will take some twisting and distorting of facts from those detractors to make that sound meaningless.

Rooney’s goals have been scored in an era of unprecedented success for Manchester United. Up until recently United dominated domestically and with three Champions League finals in four years were second only on the continent to Barcelona, arguably the best team European club football has ever seen.

Rooney’s goals were crucial, and helped United achieve trophies and glory.

The Rooney-sceptics will point to the transfer requests, but that stuff doesn’t affect legend status. The great Bobby Moore once wanted a move to Tottenham, but that doesn’t stop him being a West Ham legend, does it?

Rooney is on course to have more goals and more medals at club level than Charlton, Law and George Best. Only an unwillingness to face facts could lead anyone to suggest when he finally breaks the record at Old Trafford, Rooney will be a Manchester United legend, and arguably their greatest player of all time.

For his country Rooney’s story is different. He hasn’t scored a hat-trick in a World Cup final like Sir Geoff Hurst – in fact he hasn’t ever scored a hat-trick for England. Rooney hasn’t won a World Cup Golden Boot like Gary Lineker.

But Rooney is on course to be England’s all time record goalscorer, and I loved to hear him talk at the weekend about his desire to be the No 1 for England. That’s passion for your country!

It would be a huge achievement and if it happens, will make him an England great.

Lineker and Charlton are the top two, and they scored their goals for England during periods of great success.

Charlton won the World Cup on home soil, Lineker played in a World Cup semi-final as well as a quarter-final.

Third on the list, and the only other player above Rooney, is Jimmy Greaves. He was in the 1966 squad of course, but his record at World Cups isn’t good at all. Just 1 goal in 7 appearances in the finals, no goals in the ‘66 tournament, and not considered vital enough to the team for him to return for the final against West Germany when fully fit.

In 1962 in Chile his main contribution was to pick up a pitch-invading dog during England’s defeat to Brazil. The animal then urinated all over Greaves’ England shirt. You can add your own punchline.

Good record: Jimmy Greaves has a good goalscoring record for England - but not at World Cups

Greaves did score six hat-tricks for England, but as will as sitting only third in the list, that lack of impact at World Cups – at a time when England lifted that trophy – holds Greaves back from being a true international great, although at club level his statistics are incredible.

Rooney’s lack of goals has been part of England’s problem at World Cups of course, but he has been our main striker during a period of relative failure, which makes the number of goals he has chalked up for his country all the more remarkable.

For some players to achieve greatness on the international scene they have to do it at a World Cup. That’s the real test. But it’s not the only way to become a great for your country. Sitting on top of the all-time record goalscorers list will make Rooney an England great. He’s already scored more goals in competitive games than any other England player in history.

Only injury will stop Rooney from breaking the record and achieving greatness.
