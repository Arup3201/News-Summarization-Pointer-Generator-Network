Two young boys in Southern California have been hospitalized after ingesting methamphetamine in separate incidents which police believe may both be due to tainted Halloween candy.

The parents of one unnamed two-year-old took their son to an Orange County hospital on Saturday night after he started experiencing nightmares and wouldn’t go back to sleep.

Lab tests confirmed that the boy had been exposed to the dangerous drug.

Parents in Southern California are warned to check their children's Halloween candy after two separate incidents of kids ingesting meth were reported

Prior to getting sick, the boy had eaten a packet of Smarties candy he had received while trick-of-treating on the 25000 block of Calabria Way, Moreno Valley, on Halloween night. The boy is expected to be released from hospital on Tuesday.

Investigators are exploring whether the drugs came from tainted treats or another source. Pieces of candy tested as controls - or 
'safe' sweets - also tested positive for meth, police said.

The results are now being sent to the 
U.S. Department of Justice, which will conduct further tests to determine whether any of the police department's results were 'false positives.' Those tests could take months to complete.

Police have already probed the family's home from another source of the meth and the boy's grandfather told NBC that his family have ‘nothing to hide.’

A second boy in Huntington Beach was also hospitalized on Saturday after eating Halloween candy and he also tested positive for methamphetamine.

Detectives have confiscated all the six-year-old's trick-or-treating take-home and are testing to see if any of the sweets were laced with meth.

‘We know it was one of the things he was doing before he became sick, or under the influence,’ said Lt. Mitch O'Brien of the Huntington Beach Police Department.

The six-year-old, who is currently recovering, collected his candy near Beach Boulevard and Atlanta Avenue, officials said.

Parents in both Huntington Beach and 
Moreno Valley are advised to check all candy or other treats to assure 
that packaging hasn’t been opened and that they haven’t been tampered 
with before children eat them.

The Huntington Beach Police Department is recommending that parents carefully check any candy or other food items before they allow their kids to eat them after a two-year-old ingested meth

'In an effort to exercise extreme caution, the Huntington Beach Police Department recommends that parents carefully check any candy or other food items before they allow their kids to eat them,' said Sgt. Michael Metoyer.

The possibility that someone may have handed out drug-laced candy has been enough for some families to throw away all the goodies their children collected on Halloween.

Moreno Valley resident Joey Ramirez told NBC that he and his wife were 'not taking any chances' when it comes to their son’s safety.
