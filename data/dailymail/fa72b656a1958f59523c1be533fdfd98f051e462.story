Four members of the same family are suspected forming a real-life British Muslim 'band of brothers' by travelling to Syria together to join the so-called Islamic State insurgency.

Two siblings, aged 17 and 20, from Camden, north London, and their cousins, aged 19 and 22, from Wednesbury, West Midlands, are alleged to have run away from home to join the jihadists.

All four are believed to have flown together from London via Milan to Istanbul, before apparently making their way across the border into Syria, The Sunday Times reports.

Two of the men were named in the paper as Mejanul Islam, 22, and his brother Kamran, 19, brothers from the Black Country.

They and the London pair - who are not named - are said to have travelled in September, just as a U.S.-led coalition of Western and Arab states started bombing Isis positions in Syria.

Scotland Yard began investigating after the brothers from Camden were reported missing by their parents.

Mejanul and Kamran's father, Saydul Islam, a restaurant worker, told Sunday Times reporter Dipesh Ghader his sons vanished after telling him they were off to visit relatives in London.

'We've had no news at all,' the 43-year-old said. 'I don't know where they've gone. We're very worried.'

It is not the first time that sets of siblings have travelled together to Syria to join the Islamist-inspired Sunni insurgency over there. British medical student Nasser Muthana and his younger brother Aseel, from Cardiff, travelled to Syria over the summer.

Nasser is believed to have since featured in a gruesome video showing the decapitation of Syrian servicemen.

In July Zahra and Salma Halane, both 16, of Chorlton, Manchester, also ran away from home to travel to Syria where they married fighters after being radicalised online, earning them to sobriquet the 'terror twins'.

However, the case of Wednesbury's Islam brothers and their cousins from London is believed to be largest number of fighters from a single British family to travel abroad to join Islamic State.

The father of a suspected jihadist from Cardiff went on a daring mission to Syria to snatch his teenage son from Islamic State, the Sunday Times reports.

Karim Mohammadi reportedly travelled 2,000 miles from his home in Cardiff to Turkey before travelling across the border with the help of locals.

He is believed to be the first British father to have successfully rescued his child from the forces of the Islamic State.

His 19-year-old son Ahmed was friends with Nasser Muthana, 20, and Reyaad Khan, 21, two jihadists from Cardiff who appeared in an IS recruiting video in June.

Mr Mohammadi, who is of Iraqi-Kurdish origin, is understood to have been helped by guides from the region's Kurdish community. 

A police intelligence source said: 'There is a great sense of honour and family value in what Mr Mohammadi did.' 

Ahmed was arrested on his return to Britain in July but released without charge and referred to the government's deradicalisation programme. 

Security services say more than 500 Britons have travelled to Syria and Iraq to join the Islamic State, but a leading Muslim Labour MP says the true figure could be as many as 2,000.

Khalid Mahmood, MP for the Birmingham Perry Barr constituency, claimed last week that official figures on the numbers of British jihadis is grossly underestimating the size of the problem.

Many Britons who have travelled to join Islamic State have made the ultimate sacrifice by choosing to become suicide bombers for the fanatically devout movement.

The Sunday Times suggests the Islam brothers may have been radicalised by an extremist who turned up at a Wednesbury mosque a month ago and began extolling the virtues of holy war.

An apparently 'informed source' told the paper the man was talking about war in the time of Muslim prophet Mohammed, then mentioned 'Isis' - another name for Islamic State - and 'jihad' before he was kicked out.

Police were reportedly called to intervene after the man continued preaching in the street.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Two males, aged 17 and 20, from north London, were reported missing on September 4. 

'Officers from the counter-terrorism command searched two addresses in London and one in Wednesbury. Inquiries continue.'
