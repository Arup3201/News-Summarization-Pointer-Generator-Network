The Home Office risks accusations of political correctness  after saying that foreigners sneaking into Britain should not be referred to as illegal immigrants.

The department said those trying to get into Britain unlawfully should be referred to as 'clandestine entrants'.

The debate about the correct term to use was ignited after John Vine, the independent immigration watchdog, described them as 'irregular migrants'.

John Vine, the independent immigration watchdog, described people trying to enter the country as 'irregular migrants'

It comes after it emerged almost 3,000 attempts to enter Britain are made each month by illegal immigrants.

The number, which has almost quadrupled in just three years, does not take into account those who made it into Britain undetected.

From April to July this year, 11,920 attempts were made to enter the UK.

Each day, almost 100 illegal immigrants try to enter Britain, the statistics released following a freedom of information request sent by The Daily Telegraph newspaper reveal.

If current rates continue, by the end of the year, there could have been more than 35,000 attempts by immigrants to sneak into Britain.

That would be a huge increase on previous years. In the year April 2013 to April 2014, 19,000 attempts were made, in 2012/13 it was 11,731, and in 2011-12 the figure was 9,632.

Mr Vine appeared on BBC Radio 4's Today to discuss how the number of illegals attempting to reach Britain had soared in 2014 and described them as 'irregular migrants'.

Referring to inspection reports on the immigration system, the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration said: 'We found that people found in lorries were being released to the French authorities but no record was being kept of who they were.

'And of course these people when they try again and very often succeed in getting into the UK as irregular migrants, the authorities in Britain have no record of who they are.'

The Home Office later said that the preferred term for 'illegal immigrants' was 'clandestine entrants'.

A spokesman said: 'If you say 'illegal immigrants' there is a presumption and connotations that they have done something wrong. There are other reasons people come to this country by illegal methods, for instance because they are trafficked or organised crime groups.'

On Wednesday, Mr Vine, the chief inspector of borders and immigration said in his final report that the Home Office was still failing to 'get the basics right' on immigration.

The report added that it was 'frustrating and disappointing' to encounter the same problems 'over and over again', he added.

Attempts: Almost 100 immigrants have been trying to enter Britain illegally every day, statistics reveal

Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migrationwatch, warned that the rise was likely be caused by increased pressure on Britain's borders.

He told The Daily Telegraph: 'The sharp rise in the number of clandestines might reflect more effective detection, but an increase on this scale is more likely to be due to increased pressure on our borders.

'Part of that may be due to deteriorating conditions in the Middle East and Africa, but there is little doubt that the freedom of our society, the existence of a black market in labour and the presence of relatives and friends add up to making the UK a very attractive destination.

'The Government is seeking to make it more difficult to live in Britain illegally but it will take some time for recent measures to take effect.'

Around 2,500 migrants are camped in Calais, France, wanting to try to travel to the UK.

The Government has already earmarked £12m to improve security and has urged lorry drivers and tourists to take extra precautions to stop would-be migrants boarding their vehicles.

Immigration and security minister James Brokenshire said: 'We continue to strengthen the security of our borders to stop those who have no right to enter the UK. We have made significant investment in ports in Northern France to improve security and infrastructure.

'Using some of the best technology in the world, our officers prevented more than 18,000 attempts to cross the Channel illegally in the year to April 2014 - a rise of more than 60 per cent on the previous year.

'We have also committed £12 million to further bolstering security at Calais and driven down the cost of back-office functions, allowing us to invest more in front-line operations.'

David Hanson, shadow immigration minister, said: 'The Government has ignored repeated warnings from Labour and hauliers about the growing crisis at Calais.

'David Cameron needs to realise how serious this problem is and take urgent steps to work with our allies in Europe to sort it out. Under this Government, illegal immigration is getting worse. That's why Labour has put forward funded plans for 1,000 more border staff to help sort the problems out.

'It is unacceptable that the same people are trying night after night to enter Britain illegally. If they do not have the right to remain in Europe, why are the French authorities taking no steps to remove them?'
