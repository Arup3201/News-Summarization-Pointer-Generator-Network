A man sporting two rows of horns implanted into his forehead and a '666' tattoo has been convicted of murdering three men and chopping up their bodies today. 

Caius Veiovis screamed at the Springfield jury that convicted him Friday, saying: 'I'll see you all in hell every f****** one of you. I'll see you all in hell.'

They had considered his case for the past week in Massachusetts.

Veiovis also was convicted of three counts of kidnapping and three counts of intimidation of a witness in the killings of David Glasser, Edward Frampton and Robert Chadwell. 

Their remains were buried on private property in Becket.

The two other men charged in the killings have already been convicted.

Authorities say one of those co-defendants wanted Glasser dead so he couldn't testify against him in another case. 

The others were killed to eliminate witnesses.

The trial was moved from Berkshire County.

Veiovis along with Adam Lee Hall and David Chalue kidnapped, killed and dismembered David Glasser, Edward Frampton and Robert Chadwell with the help of an instrument resembling a machete. 

Caius Veiovis had pleaded not guilty to counts of murder, kidnapping and witness intimidation. 

Under Massachusetts law, he faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison with no chance for parole following his first-degree murder convictions..

Earlier this month, an employee at the Home Depot in Pittsfield, took the stand as a witness for the prosecution to recount how Veiovis came to the store looking to buy saws.

Veiovis also was convicted of three counts of kidnapping and three counts of intimidation. A witness remembered him buying saws for the grisly murders thanks to his distinctive appearance

Worker William Gregory recalled that even though on August 24, 2011, the store was packed with customers, he was struck by Veiovis' appearance 

According to Gregory, Veiovis and a man who accompanied him, Eric Fox, asked him to point them in the direction of saws, which he did.

The pair stopped by the aisle where wrenches were being sold before moving on to to the area containing handsaws, hatchets and hammers.

Gregory testified that he witnessed Fox pick up a hatchet and pretend to chop something. Eventually, the two men paid for a Starfold wrench set and left.

Veiovis served almost seven-and-a-half years in prison in Maine in 1999 for charges including elevated aggravated assault.

Then known as Roy Gutfinski, he and his 16-year-old girlfriend cut a teenager’s back with a razor and kissed as they licked the blood. 

The injury required 32 stitches to close.

The Kennebec Journal reported Gutfinski claimed to be a vampire and a Satan worshipper. His name was changed while in prison.
