A 10-year-old boy in Detroit shot his own father in the back while trying to stop him from fighting with his mother.

Police say the father and his long-time girlfriend, who share custody of the boy, began fighting in the early hours of Monday morning.

The 10-year-old grew concerned about his mother's safety and found a 9mm handgun inside the house about 3:30am.

'He stated that he picked up a gun and it accidentally went off at that time," said Captain Nick Kyriacou, of the Detroit PD, according to WJBK.

The boy's family told local reporters they also believe the shooting was an accident.

'He loves his daddy,' one paternal aunt told Local 4. 'They got a real good bond.

'He has been in his kids' life all their life. He loves his kids.'

The father, 33, was rushed to a local hospital in critical condition.

He may be possibly paralyzed, WJBK reported.

'It shouldn’t happen,' the aunt told WWJ.'It wasn’t that he was in there beating her.

'They had an argument and they got to fighting, and I don’t know where that gun came from,' she added. 'I don’t know where that gun came from and it shouldn’t have been in the house.'

The boy is in the custody of a family member.
