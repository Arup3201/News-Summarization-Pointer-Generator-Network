Survivor: Eleanor, two, lost her fingers and a leg to meningitis B

It is a devastating disease that can kill in hours and leaves victims with severe disabilities or brain damage.

Yet while the repercussions last a lifetime, meningitis can strike suddenly and without warning – as mother-of three Alison Coneybeare learnt to her terror.

When her gorgeous daughter Eleanor fell ill, she could only watch helplessly  as doctors fought to save her.

Tragically, Eleanor, now two, lost a leg and fingers and the family is still discovering the lasting impact of her illness.

But last month NHS advisers refused  to introduce a vaccine that could protect children such as Eleanor from meningitis B, the deadliest and most common form.

Each year it infects about 1,870 people – one in ten of whom will die.

Those who survive suffer side effects ranging from deafness and blindness to amputations.

Yet the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said the jab – licensed for use in infants by the European Commission in January – was not cost-effective and should not be provided  on the NHS.

Alison, 43, is sharing her story to highlight just how important the vaccine is.

‘I wouldn’t wish on anyone the harrowing days and weeks we spent with Eleanor fighting the disease,’ says the accountant, who lives in Reading with husband Duncan, 44, and their children.

‘We were told to prepare for the worst several times and thought we’d lose her – so although the side effects were devastating, we’re just so grateful she is still with us. Meningitis is an awful disease and I hate to think of other children suffering.’

Eleanor was just eight months old when she suddenly became ill. She had cold-like symptoms – a high temperature that paracetamol didn’t bring down and she was vomiting and refusing milk and food.

Alison was staying with her parents in Cheshire with Eleanor and her sons Ben, now ten, and Nathan, five. When Eleanor didn’t improve, she took her to a GP.

‘He suggested it was nothing more sinister than a viral throat infection,’ Alison says. ‘I questioned him about the vomiting, which didn’t seem to tally with his diagnosis, but was told that was probably just because of the high temperature.’

But the next evening Eleanor’s breathing became laboured, her skin turned grey and her eyes became ‘spacey’.

If only: Eleanor, pictured at home with her mother Alison, 43, and father Duncan, 44, could have been saved had the vaccine been provided for her

‘My mum phoned her on-call doctor and held the phone by Eleanor’s mouth so he could hear her breathing. Then we were told to call 999 right away,’ says Alison.

Paramedics rushed Eleanor to Macclesfield hospital, with Alison following behind the ambulance. ‘At one point the ambulance screeched to a halt and the driver ran round and into the back. I thought it was all over then – I still don’t know what that paramedic did, but they got her into A&E alive.’

Alison waited in the parents’ room with a nurse, ‘utterly terrified and shaking uncontrollably’, then was taken to see Eleanor, finding her with countless lines going into her tiny body, half her head shaved and surrounded by an array of medical staff.

Alison was told  she had a severe bacterial infection, to get Duncan to the hospital straight away – and prepare for the worst. ‘Duncan didn’t know if he’d see his daughter alive. I asked if she was going to die, and all they would say was that she was very, very poorly.  I went into shock and started vomiting.’

The decision of the vaccine committee to reject the meningitis B jab is truly disappointing.

We are lucky enough in the UK to vaccinate our children  against other forms of the disease, including meningitis C and pneumococcal meningitis, but meningitis B is still the UK’s leading cause of bacterial meningitis and the one doctors  fear most: it can kill within 24 hours.

Of course the committee must weigh up the safety and the financial implications of the vaccination before allowing it to become part of the national immunisation schedule.

But the safety has been verified as the vaccination now has a licence for use from the European Medicines Agency.

And I question how the cost-effectiveness has been  evaluated – it is difficult to put a price on saving a child’s life or protecting them from lifelong disability.

After the introduction of the meningitis C vaccination in 1999, it is estimated that 9,000 cases of meningitis were prevented, as well as 1,000 deaths. How can these benefits be evaluated in terms of money?

The UK has one of the highest rates of meningitis B, affecting 1,870 people a year.

One in ten of those who become ill will die, and one in three of them will be left with a life-changing injury such as brain damage or limb loss. The impact of the disease is immense.

So it is extremely frustrating to know there is a safe vaccine that we cannot give our children. If it is made available, I will be first in the queue with my children.

Hours later, at 3am, the tell-tale meningitis rash finally appeared, as Eleanor was transferred to a paediatric intensive care unit at Alder Hey Children’s Hospital in Liverpool

. She had meningitis B, which accounts for about 90 per cent of cases.

The meningococcus B microbe usually lives harmlessly at the back of noses and throats of one in ten people, mainly older children and adolescents.

But for reasons not fully understood, it can invade the blood and brain, affect the lining of blood vessels, inflame the membranes round the brain and spinal cord, and overcome the immune system.

Eleanor was severely affected; on arrival at Alder Hey a consultant said she was as ill as it was possible to be. ‘We went into intensive care and could hardly recognise her,’ Alison says.

‘She was very swollen from all the fluids being pumped into her and had a ventilator mask on. My main memory is how noisy it was, all the machines beeping and whirring and so many staff coming and going.

'I wanted to pick up my precious little girl and hold her tight, but I was too frightened to go near her.’

The next day the family was told that, while Eleanor wasn’t deteriorating, a pulse could not be felt beneath her elbows or knees so she might lose all four limbs.

‘It was devastating, but we just wanted her to survive as we’d thought we were going to lose her,’ Alison says. ‘We were offered a blood-thinning drug that might reduce the chances of her losing her limbs but could result in a fatal bleed. We chose not to go for it. It’s the kind of decision I never imagined taking as a parent.’

Over the next few days Eleanor’s condition slowly improved, but she had to lose her right leg from the knee down.

The family assumed it would then be a gradual process of steady recovery, but learnt that that doesn’t happen with meningitis. Days later an infection in Eleanor’s back needed emergency surgery, and four weeks on some of the fingers of her left hand had to be removed.

Finally, after seven harrowing weeks, Duncan and Alison took Eleanor home.

Alison says: ‘We were as open and honest with the children as we could be. Duncan and I have had counselling, as has Ben, and it will be available for all of us, including Eleanor, as she grows up.’

A team of plastic surgeons, physios and other medics are ready to help in future. They found out this year that Eleanor has profound hearing problems in one ear.

‘Hearing her laugh and watching her take her first steps with her prosthetic leg, I just feel so incredibly lucky to have her with us,’ says Alison. ‘And to know there’s little in life she won’t be able to do is beyond my wildest dreams. We just hope more parents know the warning signs of meningitis – and that the vaccine will one day be introduced for all children.’
