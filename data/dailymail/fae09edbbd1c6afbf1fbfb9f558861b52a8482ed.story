Fans of the Clangers will be relieved to see they have not changed much as they return to our screens

With their pink woolly noses and whistling speech, the Clangers were among the most memorable children’s TV characters of the 1970s.

And fans will be relieved to see they have not changed much as they return to our screens.

Last night, the BBC gave viewers the first glimpse of the Clangers, which have been reinvented for a £5million series due to be broadcast in spring.

The Clanger family – Major, Mother, Small, Tiny and Granny – are still knitted from wool and look similar to the original series’ characters.

They also still live together on the moon in the new series, which will be narrated by actor and presenter Michael Palin. 

Advances in animation since The Clangers first aired more than 45 years ago will mean some slight differences.

‘We are able to give them more personality – a little twitch of the ear which can say so much,’ said Jackie Edwards, the series’ executive producer.

‘But she added: ‘The new series is very faithful to the original. It is still made with wool and love… there is a magic about The Clangers that’s enduring. You can tell what they’re saying.’

Fans of The Clangers were immediately taken with the teaser, declaring the creatures just as ‘adorable’ as the originals.

‘My four-year old was entrances,’ said one viewer on Twitter.

‘Now this takes me back!’ said another.

The original series of The Clangers aired in 1969, and ran for 26 episodes until November 1972. There was also a four-minute election special broadcast in 1974.

Last night’s episode explained to children what a solar eclipse is, ahead of the eclipse expected to take place this morning.

It stressed that viewers should take care of their sight, only viewing the phenomenon through special goggles.

The series has had heavy involvement from Daniel Postgate, the son of Oliver Postgate, who co-created and narrated the original version of The Clangers.
