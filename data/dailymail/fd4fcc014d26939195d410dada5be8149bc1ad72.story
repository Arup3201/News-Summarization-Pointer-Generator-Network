New research suggests that aspirin may not have any heart-health benefits for older people who long believed a small daily dose of the drug might prevent heart attacks and stokes.

Using a pool of more than 14,000 Japanese people ages 60 to 85, researches saw no major differences in heart-related deaths and strokes between those regularly taking aspirin and those who didn't bother.

However, the study's authors caution people to talk to their doctors before leaving their pills behind.

'Patients need to discuss this with their doctor, because I think it's difficult to do that calculation of benefit and risk without consulting a health care professional,' said Dr. Michael Gaziano, a Harvard Medical School professor who co-authored commentary on the study, tells CBS News. 

He suspects that due to the differences between Japanese and American populations, there is little chance the study will have lasting impacts on aspirin use in the U.S.

The study was performed by doctors randomly prescribing low-doses of aspirin to older patients who suffered from high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes and tracking those who experienced health problems compared to people not taking the drug. 

The patients were tracked on an average of 5 years.  

The study's co-author, Dr. Kazuyuki Shimada, of the University of Shin-Oyama City Hospital in Japan, presented the findings Monday in Chicago at the American Heart Association's annual meeting.

Doctors suspect that due to the differences between Japanese and American populations, there is little chance the study will have lasting impacts on aspirin use in the U.S.

'It indicates that primary prevention with daily low-dose aspirin does not reduce the combined risk in this population,' he tells CBS News.

During his presentation he added that: 'the possibility that aspirin does have a beneficial effect cannot be excluded,' as the trial ended earlier than anticipated due to the low number of heart attacks or strokes. 

People who avoided aspirin were more likely to experience 'mini-strokes' and chest pains but people using aspiring were more likely to have dangerous bleeding. 

Those that have a high risk of heart problems could still benefit.  

'For all those people, they should take aspirin for the long haul, because the benefits outweigh the risk,' Gaziano said. 'But if you're very low risk, the benefits of aspirin likely don't outweigh the risk.'
