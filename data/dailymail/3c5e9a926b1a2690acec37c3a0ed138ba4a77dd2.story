Boris Becker's Spanish villa is being auctioned off for £6million after the tennis star lost a court case involving an unpaid builder's bill.

The 46-year-old former tennis player purchased the property on Majorca 17 years ago and has been embroiled in court cases over it ever since.

Now the nine-bedroom holiday home is set to be confiscated and sold at auction after Becker failed to pay £340,000 for carpentry, plumbing and layering a basketball court.

Boris Becker's Spanish villa is to be confiscated and auctioned for £6million to cover a £340,000 unpaid builder's bill and £20,000 in court costs and interest

In 2003 a court ruled that part of the villa had been constructed illegally and ordered rooms to be torn down

Becker also owes a further £20,000 in court costs and interest, bringing the total to £360,000.

Seven years ago Becker tried to sell the villa for £12.5million but failed to find a buyer. By 2012 the property value fallen to £7million.

The hope that it would turn into a dream holiday retreat on the island came to an end in 2003 when a court ruled that it had been built in part illegally and ordered the extra rooms to be demolished.

In June 2012 the German Grand Slam champion nearly lost the property in a dispute over an unpaid debt to a local gardener.

On that occasion Becker managed to pay £285,000 just as the villa was about to go under the hammer.

The Wimbledon winner, who has also had to pay divorce and paternity settlements in excess of £20million, was then slapped with a £340,000 bill from a builder in a separate settlement.

That bill remains unpaid and the villa will now be sold off to cover the money he owes in interest and court costs.

Lawyers for the tennis star argued that the estate agent who sold him the house, Matthias Kuhn, should foot the bills, but this argument was thrown out.
