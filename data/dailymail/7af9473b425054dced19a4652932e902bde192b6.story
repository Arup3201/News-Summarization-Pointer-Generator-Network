Walking in the annual Victoria’s Secret show, which is watched by millions of people worldwide, is already considered the greatest honour in lingerie modelling.

But not only will Candice Swanepoel strut her stuff as an Angel in this year’s showcase, she will also carry $10m (£6.2m) worth of bling around her bust.

The 23-year-old will take to the catwalk wearing the iconic Royal Fantasy Bra and Belt designed exclusively for Victoria's Secret by world-renowned jeweller, Mouawad.

Now that's some serious bling! Victoria's Secret Angel Candice Swanepoel has been given the honour of modelling the $10m (£6.2m) fantasy bra

The Royal Fantasy Bra and matching belt 
are adorned with over 4,200 precious gems from around the world 
including rubies, diamonds, and yellow sapphires.  

Hand set in 18 carat gold, the bra also features a 52 carat, pear shaped centre ruby. 

As well as wearing the luxurious lingerie in the show in December, the blonde bombshell - who hails from South Africa - will also don the design in the 2013 Victoria's Secret Dreams & Fantasies Catalogue.

This is the first time Candice has been given the honour of wearing a Victoria's Secret Fantasy Bra and she follows in the footsteps of the likes of industry heavyweights Miranda Kerr, Tyra Banks, Gisele Bündchen, Heidi Klum, Alessandra Ambrosio, Adriana Lima and Claudia Schiffer.

'So excited to be wearing the fantasy bra this year in the @victoriassecret fashion show!' - Swanepoel via Twitter

‘They had to make a mold of my body to be able to make [the bra], I was really excited,’ Swanepoel told People magazine.

‘I tried to imagine after they’d done the mold, how would they make it, how it would look. My imagination didn’t do it justice. My favourite part is this beautiful 52-carat pear-shaped ruby. Every part of it is exquisite.'

‘I’ve never worn anything this pricey, and we have to put gloves on when we put it on. It’s kind of a big ordeal. The bra comes with two bodyguards and we have to handle it with a lot of care!’ she added.

As the blonde bombshell prepped for the show, she tweeted to her followers: 'So excited to be wearing the fantasy bra this year in the @victoriassecret fashion show!'

The first ever Fantasy Bra was made 
in 1996 for Claudia Schiffer, but the most expensive Fantasy Bra 
produced was the Ruby Fantasy Bra worn by Gisele Bundchen in 2000, which cost an eye-watering $15m (£9.3m) to hand make.
