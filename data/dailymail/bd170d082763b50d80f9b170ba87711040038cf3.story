Prince William appeared visibly moved yesterday as he was asked to add his signature to an historic Bible, next to that of his late mother.

The royal had attended an Easter Sunday service at St Andrew’s Cathedral in Sydney when he was presented with the priceless First Fleet Bible and Book of Common Prayer.

The Bible was used in the first Christian service ever held in Australia  - in 1788 by the Chaplain of the First Fleet, Reverend Richard Johnson.

Family tradition: The signatures in the bible - including that of the late Princess Diana

Over the last 100 years it has been signed by several members of the Royal Family, including the Queen in 1954.

William’s parents, the then Prince and Princess of Wales, added their names in 1983, the Duke and Duchess of York in 1988 and Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother in 1958.

The second in line to the throne looked closely at the signatures as he was shown the books by the Rev Justin Moffatt, rector of St Phillip’s Church in Sydney, where they are kept under lock and key.

William and Kate signed their names in the Bible on the same page as Charles and Diana.

Afterwards Rev Moffatt said: ‘I am sure the prince was very well briefed but he seemed surprised that so many members of his family had signed the Bible.

'He seemed genuinely touched to see so many of their signatures there.’

Rev Moffatt added: ‘Prince William also joked to me ‘It’s in very good nick!’ and I told him that it was very well looked after indeed.

‘He also seemed rather touched when I turned to the page of the Solemnization (c) of Matrimony which was covered with ink blots from the signatures of the first Christians to marry in Australia.

‘I explained to him that the first convicts to settle here held those pens.

‘The prince seemed fascinated.’

The family later visited the Taronga Zoo to view a Bilby called George after the baby Prince

The Duchess wore an elegant dove grey Alexander McQueen coat with Jane Taylor Hat and Gucci shoes to the service in the heart of the city.

Her hair had been elaborately coiffed underneath her hat in an attractive half up, half down style.

After their day’s engagements were over, the couple flew to Canberra, where they will base themselves for the rest of their stay in Australia.

Kate, 32, stepped off the plane in a blue Stella McCartney dress from her existing wardrobe.

Her son, Prince George, had also changed into £55 navy shorts and cardigan by Rachel Riley.
