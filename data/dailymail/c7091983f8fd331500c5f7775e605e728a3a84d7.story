A rookie policewoman has 'set pulses racing' among the boys in blue after posing in her underwear in a bid to become the new face of a plus-size lingerie firm.

Sophia Adams, a trainee officer in the Met, entered the Star in a Bra competition for Curvy Kate, a lingerie firm specialising in D-K cup bras, knickers and swimwear.

The firm does not use professional models and picks women to model their lingerie by running a Star in a Bra competition, with the winner handed a one-year modelling deal.

Voting for the winner begins next month, but Miss Adams, who has a 32JJ bust, is apparently already causing a 'sensation' among colleagues

Miss Adams, 21, fought off challenges from 1,000 women from all over the world to get down to the last 10 in the competition.

Voting for the winner begins next month, but Miss Adams, who has a 32JJ bust, is already causing a 'sensation' with the boys in blue.

Writing about herself on the Curvy Kate website, Miss Adams, of Northolt, north west London, says: 'I'm entering Star in a Bra because I finally have the confidence and would love to model for Curvy Kate.

'I used to have so many body hang ups, hated my size and wanted to change myself.

'But as I get older I'm realising it's all about self love and treating your body like the temple it is.'

The winner of the competition - chosen by online vote - will win an all-expenses Mediterranean holiday with £1,000 in spending money as well as a one-year modelling contract for the firm.

Speaking this week, a police source said the photos online were 'causing a sensation' among officers.

He said: 'Sophia is the talk of the nick - obviously it's gone round that she's in the last 10 of this competition and some colleagues get hot flushes when they see her.

'She's really set pulses racing around here.'

He added: 'She's taking it all in her stride - we're all hoping she'll win, but hopefully she won't leave the force to become an international superstar.'

In 2013 a former contestant in Bra for a Star, West Midlands teacher Laura Butler, spoke out after her A-Level pupils recognised her from her photo shoots for the firm.

She said she did the modelling in 2008 before becoming a teacher, adding: 'I am not a shy girl, so confidence was never something I was lacking.

'Star In A Bra seemed to cement that confidence and it really shines through now in all I do.'

A spokesman for Curvy Kate said the online vote for a winner from the top 10 would take place at the end of the month, adding: 'This year we're having a worldwide curve celebration.

'We make beautiful lingerie and swimwear that looks amazing on a wide range of figures and sizes, so we want models who represent this.

'We're looking for our next Star in a Bra queen - all of the models you see in our brochures are discovered through our annual Star in a Bra competition and they're chosen by you.

'With the public outcry for the use of more realistic images in the media, Star in a Bra champions the use of relatable role models and promotes a positive approach to body image.

'We want to show you exactly how our lingerie will look and fit on a variety of body shapes, cementing that there isn't one type of 'perfect body'.'
