Three independent reviews commissioned by then health minister Lord Darzi were produced by top consulting firms

Labour was accused yesterday of suppressing damning reports revealing a ‘culture of fear’ in the NHS five years ago which critics say could have saved lives.

Months before the scandal at Mid Staffordshire was uncovered, three independent reviews commissioned by then health minister Lord Darzi were produced by top consulting firms.

However, they were never published after they heavily criticised management culture and relentless pursuit of targets.

One involving interviews with dozens of individuals across the Health Service, by the US-based Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI), described in raw terms how ‘the NHS has developed a widespread culture more of fear and compliance than of learning, innovation and enthusiastic participation in improvement’.

It said: ‘The patient doesn’t seem to be in the picture. We were struck by the virtual absence of mention of patients and families in the overwhelming majority of our conversations.’ 

One NHS worker told the authors: ‘The risk of consequences to managers is much greater for not meeting expectations from above than for not meeting expectations of patients and families.’ 

Most damningly, it noted: ‘Because of the fear of what will happen if targets are not hit, it’s not uncommon for managers and clinicians to hit the target and miss the point.’  

Charlotte Leslie, the Tory MP for Bristol North West who is calling for NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson to resign, tackled David Cameron about the ‘dangerous’ culture they revealed at Prime Minister’s questions yesterday.

She called for an investigation into why the reports were not published, saying: ‘Had they not been suppressed, thousands of lives could possibly have been saved.’ 

Mr Cameron said: ‘I will look carefully at the issue. Where there is bad practice and where things are going wrong, we need to shine a very bright light on it and make sure not only that we deal with it but that we hold people to account.’ 

Miss Leslie, who has attacked Sir David for presiding over a ‘catastrophe’ at Mid Staffordshire, now has more than 30 MPs backing her early day motion calling for his resignation.

She said the reports – which were commissioned for the 60th birthday of the NHS and produced in January 2008 – had been ‘covered up’.

‘They commissioned them to be published, expecting it to be a fantastic news story. But they found that beneath their gleaming language and some rigging of statistics, patients had suffered in a very bad way. 

‘So they swept these reports under the carpet and pretended these catastrophic failings, leading to thousands upon thousands of unnecessary deaths, were not happening.’ 

The IHI report noted that while NHS funding had nearly trebled over the previous decade, in many areas it had failed to raise standards.

Another report by the highly-respected Joint Commission International, an independent consulting firm, identified ‘a pervasive culture of fear in the NHS and certain elements of the Department of Health’.

A third report, by the Rand Health group, said that while mortality statistics prepared for staff to look at were high quality, there seemed to be no awareness of them.

When the reports were uncovered by Freedom of Information requests in 2010, the Department of Health insisted they had never been intended for publication and had fed into a number of recommendations for the Health Service published by Lord Darzi a year later – although none was mentioned by name. 

An adviser to Labour’s health spokesman Andy Burnham said yesterday: ‘They fed into the Darzi review which was published and was a key moment of our latter years, and new quality controls were enacted as a result. There was no sinister cover-up.’ 

Lord Darzi, an eminent surgeon, wrote of the need to restore quality to the NHS. He quit the following year in a move seen as a major blow to Gordon Brown.
