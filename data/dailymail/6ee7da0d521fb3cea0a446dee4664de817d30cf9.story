SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft - designed to be the first-ever commercial space flight to dock with the International Space Station - has been delayed.

The unmanned craft was due to fly to the ISS on February 7 - carrying a payload of non-essential supplies in case of failure.

SpaceX has now postponed the launch to allow for more engineering tests. The company - run by PayPal co-founder Elon Musk - has already put a capsule in orbit and retrieved it safely.

SpaceX has said that it aims for manned flights by 2014.

'In preparation for the upcoming launch, SpaceX continues to conduct extensive testing and analysis,' said SpaceX spokesperson Kirstin Grantham.

'We believe that there are a few areas that will benefit from additional work and will optimize the safety and success of this mission.'

No new launch date has been announced.

The SpaceX launch is unique because the rockets are reusable - and will return to Earth once the Dragon capsule has been released into orbit. The ISS astronauts will grab it with a robotic arm

SpaceX will work with Nasa to set a new date for Dragon's rendezvous with the space station.

'We are now working with NASA to establish a new target launch date, but note that we will continue to test and review data. We will launch when the vehicle is ready,' said Grantham.

NASA 
has turned to industry to help stock the space station now that the 
space shuttles are retired, investing hundreds of millions of dollars in
this start-up effort.

The station currently is supplied by Russian, 
European and Japanese vessels.

SpaceX's
Dragon capsule will fly within two miles of the space station, for a 
checkout of all its systems.

Then it will close in, with station 
astronauts grabbing the capsule with a robotic arm. The Dragon 
ultimately will be released for a splashdown in the Pacific.

Hard at work: The SpaceX Dragon completed a significant milestone on November 16 when the capsule was mated with the trunk inside the company's launch processing hangar in Cape Canaveral, Florida

None of the other cargo carriers come back intact; they burn up on re-entry.

If
the rendezvous and docking fail, SpaceX will try again. That was the 
original plan: to wait until the third mission to actually hook up with 
the station and delivery supplies. SpaceX wanted to hurry it up.

None of the supplies on board the Dragon will be one-of-a-kind or crucial, in case of failure.

SpaceX
– run by PayPal co-founder Elon Musk – is one of several companies 
vying for space station visiting privileges. It hopes to step up to 
astronaut ferry trips in perhaps three more years. In the meantime, 
Americans will be forced to continue buying seats on Russian Soyuz 
spacecraft.

SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said on Friday at a forum in Seattle about NASA's future: 'Every decision that we make at SpaceX is focused on... taking crew to space.'

Success: On February 7, 2012, SpaceX will attempt another orbital flight from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. This time, the unmanned Dragon capsule will fly to the space station and dock with a load of supplies

Trial run: NASA announced the news on Friday - one year and one day after SpaceX, became the first private business to launch a capsule into orbit and return it safely to Earth

She said the company is 
'thrilled' at the prospect of delivering cargo to the space station 
early next year, and noted that the company is shooting for 2014 with 
astronauts.

Congress 
has appropriated $406million for the commercial crew effort for 2012, 
considerably less than NASA's requested $850million.

'It is nevertheless a significant step,' Ms Garver said at the forum, televised by NASA.

She
said NASA is evaluating whether it can speed up when U.S. companies 
'deliver our precious astronauts to and from the space station.'
