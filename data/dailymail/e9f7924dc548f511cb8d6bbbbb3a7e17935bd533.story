Google's rearguard battle to keep people interested in its Facebook rival Google Plus continues with a $100m purchase of social sharing site Meebo.

Meebo's chat toolbar allows for easy sharing of social links - and crucially, advertising, which is where Google makes its money from its AdWords search engine.

‘We are always looking for better ways 
to help users share content and connect with others across the web, just
as they do in real life,’ a Google spokesperson said.

Google Plus has so far failed to reach the huge numbers of rival Facebook, and has been dogged by reports that even its signed up users rarely use the service

Meebo works as a chat and sharing toolbar which lets users chat as they browse the web.

The Meebo service is also available as an app.

California-based Meebo provides software
that lets users share pages on social networking sites, including 
Facebook , allowing publishers and advertisers to promote products in 
interactive ways.

he world's biggest search engine, Google Inc, will buy Meebo Inc, a startup that helps online publishers connect their websites with social network sites, Meebo said on its blog.  

Last month, technology blog All Things Digital reported that Google was in talks to buy Meebo in a deal worth about $100 million.   

‘We look forward to closing the transaction and working with the Meebo team to create more ways for users to engage online.’  

Meebo, founded in 2005, says it 
reaches half of the U.S. Internet population, allowing users to build 
their own web experiences around the things that interest them the 
most.
