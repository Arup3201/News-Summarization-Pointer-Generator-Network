Darren Ferguson has expressed his sadness following his departure from Peterborough on Saturday.   

The League One side parted ways with Ferguson following his side's 3-0 defeat to MK Dons.

Ferguson issued a statement on Monday night and stated: 'The great times will stay with me and my memories of the club are nothing but positive.'

Ferguson's side found themselves three goals down at half time on Saturday with William Grigg and a brace from Ben Reeves sending the Dons into a commanding position which they never relinquished.

The club has also parted ways with Gary Breen, Gavin Strachan, Jimmy Walker, Stewart England and Marc Lindsey.

Peterborough have been victorious just once in their last five league games and currently sit 15th in the table – four points off the play off places.

Son of former Manchester United boss Sir Alex, Ferguson will be remembered fondly by fans during his two stints as manager at London Road Stadium. 

Ferguson guided the club from League Two to the Championship between 2007 and 2009. 

He returned for a second spell in 2011 and helped Peterborough secure a return to the Championship once more. 

It is with great sadness and regret that my time at Peterborough United has come to an end.

The great times will stay with me and my memories of the club are nothing but positive.

My sincere thanks to all my staff who worked tirelessly to achieve the success that we had and I wish all of them good luck for the future.

I would like to thank all the players who showed courage and passion during my time which of course included leading the club to three promotions and winning The Johnstone's Paint Trophy. I have taken great pleasure in watching so many of them developing their careers and playing great football in the higher leagues.

Thank you to Bob Symns and Barry Fry for their help, advice and support.

Thanks to Darragh MacAnthony, a great Chairman who had faith in me, supported me and gave me my first role as a manager. The Posh are very lucky to have such a dedicated Chairman and I am sure he will have success again.

Finally, and most importantly, thank you to the brilliant Posh fans who have been there all the way. The days we had at Hereford, Colchester, Old Trafford and Wembley will be etched on all our minds as some of the greatest Posh moments and I am extremely proud to have been part of that. The support from the fans during my last game at MK Dons was outstanding, the defiance they showed in the midst of being beaten by our greatest rivals tells its own story.

I would like to wish Peterborough United the very best of luck for the future and thanks again for having me.
