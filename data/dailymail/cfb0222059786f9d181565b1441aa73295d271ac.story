An Oregon man who turned a Boeing 727 
into his home has now set his sights on an even bigger model in the 
hopes of building a second home in Japan out of a retired 747.

Bruce Campbell made the 727 his home in the suburbs of Portland and spends six months of the year there.Â 

Complete with wings, and landing gear resting on pillars, it is where Campbell spends six months of the year.

In 1999, the former electrical engineer had a vision: To save retired jetliners from becoming scrap metal by reusing them.

Slightly built and with a charming smile, the 64-year-old Campbell sees the task as part of his goal in life.

'Mine
 is to change humanity's behavior in this little niche,' he said as he 
stood beside the plane, lamenting the need to power wash its exterior 
and trim the dense foliage.

Campbell
 is one of a small number of people worldwide - from Texas to the 
Netherlands - who have transformed retired aircraft into a living space 
or other creative project, although a spokesman for the Aircraft Fleet 
Recycling Association was unable to say precisely how many planes are 
re-used this way.

AFRA, an 
organization made up of industry leaders including Boeing that focus on 
sustainable end-of-service practices for airframes and engines, 
estimates that 1,200 to 1,800 aircraft will be dismantled globally over 
the next three years, and 500 to 600 will be retired annually over the 
next two decades.

'AFRA is happy to see aircraft fuselages re-purposed in a range of creative ways,' said AFRA spokesman Martin Todd.

'We would want them to be recovered and be re-used in an environmentally sustainable fashion.'

Campbell
 was in his early 20s when he paid around $23,000 for the 10 acres on 
which his plane rests. His original plan was to make a home from freight
 vans, but then he decided a plane would be better. A van still sits 
nearby, covered in growth.

He purchased the 727 after hearing about a Mississippi hairdresser who had done it.

Now,
 about $220,000, many years of work and several hard-learned lessons 
later, Campbell is ready to do it all over again, this time with a 
Boeing 747 he hopes to buy and move to Japan, where he also spends half 
of the year.

Campbell is 
working to restore some of the plane's original features, from the 
cockpit to flight stairs, a working lavatory, LED lighting and some of 
the seats.

'For him to be 
running electricity and flashing beacons is kind of amazing,' said Katie
 Braun, a pilot and flight instructor who came to see the airplane home 
after learning about it in 2012.

'It
 makes perfect sense that they use those airplanes for something,' she 
said. 'It's a fascinating concept. I think it could take traction if 
people were more environmental.'

The
 transition wasn't easy. While restoring the plane, Campbell spent years
 living in a mobile home. When that became infested with mice, he moved 
into the aircraft, despite lacking a building permit.

On
 board, Campbell leads a modest life. He sleeps on a futon, bathes in a 
makeshift shower and cooks with a microwave or toaster, eating mostly 
canned food and cereal.

A 
shoe rack with numerous pairs of slippers greets visitors, and he asks 
that everyone wear slippers or socks to avoid tracking in dirt.

While
 Campbell has created a website with details on rebuilding planes, he's 
not the only one with such a vision as aircrafts have been made into 
homes in Texas, Costa Rica and the Netherlands. Taking it one step 
further, there is an airplane boat in Florida.

'I think most people are nerds in their hearts in some measure,' Campbell said.

'The point is to have fun.'
