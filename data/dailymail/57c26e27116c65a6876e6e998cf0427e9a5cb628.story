The moment police heard gunshots inside Sydney's Lindt Chocolat café they made the decision to storm the building.

An Iranian-born gunman Man Haron Monis was killed, along with a 38-year-old female and 34-year-old male hostage after a dramatic firefight brought an end to his almost 17-hour siege.

At 2.14am on Tuesday, teams of heavily armed police swooped on the cafe in a hail of gunfire, ending a tense stand-off where the self-styled sheik had been holding 17 people captive – including five people who escaped on Monday.

NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said police entered the building after they heard gunfire and feared hostages had been hit.

'They made the call because they believed at that time if they didn't enter it would have been many more lives lost,' Mr Scipione said.

'I understand there was a number of gunshots that were heard, which caused officers to move straight to what we call an EA – emergency action plan – and that caused them to enter.'

Mr Scipione said of the 12 hostages still being held captive in the early hours of Tuesday, two were killed and four had suffered traumatic injuries or from existing medical conditions.

A police officer was wounded by a gunshot to his face, he added.

'I have talked to that officer, he is in good condition. He is well and grateful to be alive,' Mr Scipione said.

Mr Scipione said just six hostages were not injured physically, along with the five that escaped the siege on Monday afternoon, and they were being assessed as part of a hostage reception plan.

'They're part of this investigation - we need to talk to them,' Mr Scipione said.

'They're being looked after in terms of their psychological needs at the moment.

'We will then work with them but at this stage they're being well cared for.'

He added that they were with their families, who were assisting them in the process.

Mr Scipione made the solemn pilgrimage to the shrine of flowers and tributes which has been building near the Lindt cafe on Tuesday morning.

'I've got to say I don't think I could be sadder but I'm incredibly proud of our police and what they've done to keep us safe. I've got nothing but praise for them,' Mr Scipione said.

'I've come to have a look at what Sydney's done, they've started to pour out their hearts and I am sure that it is only going to grow.'

When told people were arriving in tears he responded with 'we'll, I'm not far from it'.

At least three victims were treated at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Camperdown on Tuesday morning, but have since been discharged.

It is understood at least one more victim is being treated at Royal North Shore Hospital in St Leonards.

Mr Scipione said the Lindt café premises had now been 'secured', and at this stage no explosive devices had been found.
