Moving on: Dawson has been at Tottenham for nine years since joining from Nottingham Forest

'Michael Dawson has completed a move from Tottenham Hotspur, the club are delighted to announce,' read a statement on City's official website.

Dawson, the Tottenham captain last season, played over 300 times for the North London club after joining from Nottingham Forest in 2005.

'The season Hull had last year was incredible,' he told Hull's official Youtube channel. 'To get to the final of the FA Cup, secure the Premier League position and now we've got to look to build on that and that's what we're going to do.

'The chance to be in the group stage of the Europa League with a game on Thursday, all we can do is build on it and look forward to the season ahead.

'You need the squad and the manager is getting the squad together to compete in both or all competitions. The players and the quality we've got in this dressing room, I'm sure we can manage that.'

Dawson's older brother Andy spent 10 years with the Tigers as they rose through the divisions and the younger Dawson admits he feels like he knows the club already.

'I know the club well with my family history, with Andy being here,' he said. 'I'm just excited to get started.

'The attraction is the whole football club, the manager the squad of players.

'I know the fans gave me plenty of stick last year when I was playing for Tottenham. Hopefully I'll get a nicer reception now but it was all good fun.

'I'm just ready and raring to go.'

Hull manager Steve Bruce has already bolstered his squad with the signings of two forwards and two defenders this summer. 

Robert Snodgras and Tom Ince have been brought in to provide attacking impetus, although the former has already sustained a long-term injury, while Harry Maguire and Andrew Robertson will provide defensive cover. 

Hull have also made Jake Livermore's loan deal from last year into a permanent signing. 

The Tigers face KSC Lokeren at home on Thursday night needing to overturn a one-goal deficit to reach the Europa League group stage.

They have made a promising start to the season in the League, beating QPR on the opening day before drawing at home to Stoke City with 10 men.
