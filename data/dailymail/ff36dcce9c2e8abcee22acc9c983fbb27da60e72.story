Miami Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill’s model wife left an assault rifle in a rental car.

Lauren Tannehill, 26, somehow left an AR-15 in the back of a rented Nissan SUV earlier this month, it was found by a mother and daughter using the car during a visit from New York.

The dynamic duo doesn’t face criminal charges because they legally own the gun, and declined to comment through a team spokesperson, according to a Sun Sentinel report.

Bombshell: Lauren Tannehill, wife of Dolphins QB Ryan Tannehill, left an AR-15 assault rifle in the back of a rented SUV

Ms Tannehill rented the white Nissan Rogue Jan 4 for only a few hours before she swapped it for another car. The fully loaded was then rented to Judith Fleissig, 58, of Rochester, New York.

Ms Fleissig drove around southern Florida for two days before her daughter discovered a bag in the back of the vehicle.

Ms Fleissig’s daughtrer opened the bag expecting to find an ID, she instead found the firearm.

‘We got out of the car, we were kind of freaked out,’ she told the paper. ‘I didn’t want to touch it.’Both women were stunned.

‘Oh my God, it’s a gun,’ Ms Fleissig’s daughter said.  ‘I said, ‘I think I’m going to throw up,’ she recalled.

They took a picture and headed to the closest police station to turn the gun over, she explained.Authorities eventually traced it back to the Tannehills after valuing it at $2,000.

‘Though dangerous if it would have landed in the wrong hands, it’s not criminal,’ Broward sheriff's spokeswoman Keyla Concepción told the paper. ‘They simply forgot it.’

The only snafu faced by Ms Fleissig was having to wait for cops to make sure the weapon wasn’t stolen.

Had the gun been stolen, police would have had to impound the SUV, she added.

‘[I thought] ‘this vacation is getting better and better,’ the mother recalled.

She was eventually let go and Ryan Tannehill was advised to pick his AR-15 up at the Hillsboro Beach Police Department.

An E-Z Rent-A-Car spokesperson told the Sun Sentinal that cars are cleaned before being given to new customers and that he was ‘not sure how that could get past.’
