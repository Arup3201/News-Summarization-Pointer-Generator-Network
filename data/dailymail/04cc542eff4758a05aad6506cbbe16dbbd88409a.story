Arsenal defender Mathieu Debuchy is hoping to resume full training next month after a frustrating start to his career at the Emirates.

The French right back signed from Newcastle United in the summer after 18 months with the Magpies but has been sidelined since suffering an ankle injury in Arsenal’s 2-2 draw with Manchester City in September.

Arsenal’s problems in defence were underlined last week when they threw away a 3-0 lead against Anderlecht in the Champions League, then lost 2-1 to Swansea last Sunday despite being 1-0 up with 15 minutes left.

Debuchy, who spent nine seasons with French side Lille, is making good progress with his recovery and is targeting a comeback with the Gunners next month.

‘My injury is now better,” Debuchy told Arsenal.com. ‘I work hard every day with the physio and I want to be back on the pitch in December. I’m looking forward to it.

‘I was really proud when I signed for Arsenal and it has been frustrating getting injured so soon, but I am focused on coming back stronger. I am very positive about that.

‘Training at Arsenal is an extremely high standard. I’m nearly 30 but I’m still improving by training with players who are of such a high quality, like everyone at Arsenal.’
