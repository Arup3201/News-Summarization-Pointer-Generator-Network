Twitter user Laura Evans posted a picture of this Karen Millen mannequin to Twitter and pointed out that it looked dangerously thin

Fashion store Karen Millen has come under fire for featuring a mannequin in their shop that appeared to be seriously underweight. 

Laura Evans, from Hampshire, tweeted a picture of one of the plastic models which featured ribs clearly protruding from the chest.

She wrote: 'Karen Millen, why've you chosen to make collar bones & ribs so central to the marketing of this dress? Dangerous!'

The medic's picture was quickly picked up by outraged women on the social media site, who called for the mannequin to be removed from the stores. 

One user called @WitchBrain wrote: 'Ewwww! I buy Karen Millen quite often, but I DO NOT want to look like this! What on earth is this about?' 

Another called ‏@JoLiptrott said: Shame on @KarenMillen for this normalising of the super-skinny. What a terrible message to send to our young women.'

Women weren't the only ones disgusted by the mannequin's skinny frame though - men also voiced their distaste.  

A user called ‏@seanmurphy2711 wrote: 'Almost beyond belief. Someone has made conscious decision to do that.'

A spokesperson for the British eating disorder charity BEAT said: 'It’s very concerning that well respected and influential high street fashion retailers persist in using obviously underweight mannequins.

'Unhelpful in fuelling the continuous exposure of thinness as the ‘ideal’, retailers should consider very seriously the messages that they put across and we should all play a part in giving a generation of young people confidence in their bodies, their appearance and their sense of wellbeing.'

The spokesperson continued: 'People who are at risk, or already affected by an eating disorder can be triggered or maintained in the disorder by the images they see everywhere. 

'The constant portrayal of a very slender look as the only aspirational ideal for young people needs to be challenged if a generation are to grow up with a robust sense of their self worth.'

Laura Evans posted the picture of the mannequin on Twitter along with a photo of the dress on the runway

Twitter users were quick to voice their disgust at the pictures 

Karen Millen has responded to the criticism on the social media site, with a spokesperson saying: 'As a brand we celebrate a range of body sizes within collections and offer size 6 through to 16. 

'Both the mannequin and model you have seen representing Karen Millen are size 10 which is industry standard. 

'No offence was meant and the intention is not to advertise a negative body image but to focus on the style of the garment in both instances. 

'We are so sorry for any disappointment and upset this may have caused.'  

The model who wore the dress on the catwalk also had a very slender frame

The furore comes just a few weeks after the high street store Whistles were criticised for featuring a super skinny mannequin in one of their stores.  

With a protruding chest bone and super skinny arms, this is the incredibly slim mannequin being used by high street store Whistles. 

The shocking picture was taken by a passer-by of a window display of the brand's Angel store in London. It shows the thin-looking mannequin wearing a floaty white top.

In response to the photograph below, which was taken in February, eating disorder charities have called for shops to take more responsibility for setting standards.

Mary George from Beat, the UK's leading charity supporting those with eating disorders, said: 'It is disappointing to see such an obviously underweight mannequin in the high street. 

'This stereotype can be extremely harmful to some and while the fashion industry doesn't directly cause eating disorders- it has a powerful influence that is highly toxic to some vulnerable young people. 

'We call on retailers to recognise the responsibility they have to use this influence in positive, life enhancing ways. Fashion can be fantastic- creative, aspirational and fun. 

'What we need is a mixture of different heights and widths of mannequins in our shops to reflect the reality of people's different shapes and sizes, heights, widths and build.'

Amina Hays, who took the photograph of the mannequin after spotting it in Upper Street brand of Whistles, said she found it 'revolting'.

The 32-year-old said: 'There has been so much uproar with the fashion industry not representing 'real' women I thought idiocies like this had been abolished. 

'I'm a size eight and this made me feel fat which is just not acceptable.'  

Controversy: Whistles has come under fire from eating disorder charities for using super slim mannequins

Marg Oaten MBE, the secretary and co-founder of SEED Eating Disorder Support Services, told FEMAIL: 'Without doubt the mannequin is not a realistic reflection of a body size and shape.

'It is outrageous to portray this as acceptable – people may aspire to this body shape whilst people with an eating disorder, may in fact consider themselves not thin enough.

'I really do think the retailers have a duty of care to its shoppers to be more realistic in the size of the model or mannequins that they use to showcase their goods.'

Marg went on to say: 'Often people who are low in self-esteem have a false belief that by managing body weight and shape they will be happier, in truth they may plummet to dangerously low levels in weight that may cause them to be medically at risk.

'People need to be comfortable in the skin they are in – and celebrate the difference in body weight and shape.

She added: 'Promoting clothing in this way can be highly dangerous to potential sufferers of anorexia nervosa. 

'An eating disorder has the highest mortality rate of any other mental health illness with a staggering 20 per cent of people dying each year from their illness or through suicide.

'Manufacturers and retailers need to take more responsibility for their actions and consider the consequences of how this may impact on people suffering from an eating disorders.'

Gina Hutchings, a part time plus model said: 'I do not think the fuller figure has made its way to high fashion yet which is sad as fuller figured women can be just as stylish as slimmer women.

'The high street usually means clothes everyone can wear so it’s disappointing to see this mannequin used by Whistles. 

'Skinny shaming is now as bad as fat shaming and as talked about but Whistles are failing to show a healthy figure.'

MailOnline also contacted Whistles for comment. 

In October student Becky Hopper posted this image of her friend standing next to a Topshop mannequin with stick thin legs

More women with normal sized legs posed next to the Topshop mannequin. The store said it was not meant to represent a real woman

In October, Topshop was slammed for using using mannequins with stick thin legs with student Becky Hopper sharing a picture of her friend posing comparing her legs to those on the model.

The image was shared more than 7,000 times .A Topshop spokesman said the mannequin was ‘based’ on a size 10.

‘The form is a stylised one to have more impact in store and create a visual focus,’ said the spokesman.

‘Mannequins are made from fibreglass, so [they] need to be of certain dimensions to allow clothing to be put on and removed. This is therefore not meant to be a representation of the average female body.’ 

Over the last decade, campaigners have been fighting back against a series of fashion and online trends they say encourage eating disorders.

A row over so-called 'size zero' models was sparked in 2000 when the British Medical Association linked an obsession with 'abnormally thin' models on TV and in magazines with the rise in conditions such as anorexia and bulimia.

Madrid Fashion Week banned models with a body mass index below 18.5 from its catwalks in 2006 in what was seen as a victory for campaigners against size zero.

But later that year, Paraguayan model Luisel Ramos was found dead from a heart attack linked to malnutrition and six months later her sister, model Eliana Ramos, 18, died in similar circumstances.

Their deaths were used to highlight the pressure on models to meet a demand for unnaturally thin young women.

Campaigners have hit out over the use of 'size zero' models on catwalks and have linked the desire among women to emulate the so-called 'thigh gaps' of models like Cara Delevingne (right) to eating disorders

Last year, internet craze 'thinspiration' - where people post photographs of their emaciated bodies on social media to 'inspire' weight loss - was also blamed for encouraging eating disorders.

Susan Ringwood, from charity Beat, said: 'Those pictures are very unlikely to be real.

'They are digitally manipulated to make the bodies shown appear extremely emaciated. Altered pictures of famous people are often included too.'

A further craze by girls to emulate model's 'thigh gaps' erupted earlier this year when experts warned it was further fuelling the issue.

Nancy Albus, head of a facility which deals with sufferers in St. Louis, USA said: 'The intrusion and presence of social media in our lives really does make it very difficult.

'The important distinction about thigh gap is it gives you an actual visual to achieve, this visual comparison of how your body does or doesn't stack up.'
