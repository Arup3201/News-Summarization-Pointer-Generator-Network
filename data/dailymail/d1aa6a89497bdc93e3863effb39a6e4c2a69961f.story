Celtic 'hid' from calls and emails from Legia Warsaw about the ineligible player that cost the Polish club their place in the Champions League, according to the chairman of their country's FA.

Celtic were gifted a place in the play-off round of Europe's top tier competition despite losing 6-1 on aggregate to Legia in the third qualifying round - courtesy of an admin mistake with the victors bringing on an ineligible player.

Legia were stripped of their Champions League status and Polish FA chairman Zbigniew Boniek claims Celtic were unreachable as the saga unravelled, with calls and emails that could have seen their opponents put through ignored.

Keep your heads down, boys: Celtic have been accused of ignoring calls and emails from Legia Warsaw

Ineligible: Bartosz Bereszynski (right) was deemed to be playing illegally, seeing Legia stripped of their place

Bartosz Bereszynski is a Polish international who has won two caps for his country. He started his career at Lech Poznan in 2009 before joining Legia Warsaw in 2013.

The 22-year-old was suspended for the match having picked up a three match ban last season after being sent off against Apallon in the Europa League.

He could have served two matches of his suspension in the second round against St Patrick's but Legia failed to register the defender for those matches allowing Berg to choose from his full compliment of 25 players.

Boniek claims that the Glasgow club's consent would have seen Legia allowed to stay in the competition but Celtic simply disappeared off the radar on the day.

'Had Celtic officially given up their place, Legia could have stayed in Champions League,' Boniek said in quotes translated by  Polish journalist Robert Blaszczak.

'Celtic were unreachable that day. Didn't return the calls or reply to e-mails. They just hid and waited.'

The Champions League play off round paired Cletic with Slovenian side Maribor while Legia are left to face Aktobe of Kazakhstan in the Europa League play off.

The Polish club will be hoping to reach the final in their home city at the end of the season - although they are also expected to launch an appeal against UEFA's decision. 

'We will definitely appeal,' manager Henning Berg said of the verdict. 'We will appeal it all the way.

'How far? As far as we can because we don’t think this is the right decision.'
