An Indian teenager sliced off his tongue with a blunt blade in an extreme act of devotion to his Hindu God.

Lalmohan Soren, 17, was sitting at Mahedevgarha Temple, in Dugda, Jharkhand, when worshippers spotted blood splattered across the floor as they filled the temple for their morning prayers.

Lalmohan's tongue was inside a bowl next to his feet with a note saying: ‘I have cut off my tongue and offered it to Lord Shiva.

'Please do not throw me out of the temple, I just want to sit here at the feet of the Lord’.

Horrific: Lalmohan Soren, 17, was sitting at Mahedevgarha Temple (above) when worshippers spotted blood splattered across the floor as they filled the temple for their morning prayers

The temple leader was informed and eventually he managed to persuade Lalmohan to go to hospital.

Doctors tried stitching his tongue back together but failed and eventually Lalmohan was discharged after a few days.

This area of India is infamous for its superstitious Santhal tribes who practice unusual rituals to please their Gods.

Lalmohan is now at home recovering - unable to talk and feeding on a liquid diet - but proud of his actions.

'His future is up to the Gods': Lalmohan is now recovering at home with his family - unable to talk and feeding on a liquid diet - but proud of his actions

His family are both shocked but accepting of his actions.

Mother Lalmuni Soren said: 'My son has been involved in religious practises since childhood.

'He takes a keen interest in rituals, but I never believed he’d one day severe his tongue to please the Gods.

‘I don’t know what will happen to him now, he’ll never be able talk properly again, so what future he will have is up to the Gods.'

However, the mother-of-four was sure her son would be blessed.

She added: ‘My son has sacrificed his tongue to please the God so we’re sure the God will fulfil his wishes and give him a good life.’

Locals are surprised at the media attention Lalmohan's actions have attracted as this kind of ritual is normal in their community, saying 'there’s nothing new in it'.

Manoj Sharma, a local resident, said: ‘The tribal people are very superstitious and have always practiced weird rituals. In 2011 a boy severed two of his fingers and offered it to the God at the same temple.

'This incident is nothing new to us but yes, it is bizarre to many other people.’
