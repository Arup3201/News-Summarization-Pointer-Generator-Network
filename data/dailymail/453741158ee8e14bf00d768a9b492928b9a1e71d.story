It's one of the most successful awareness campaigns that has ever run online, with people from Giselle Bundchen to George W. Bush to Bill Gates taking part.

The ALS Ice Bucket Challenge has raised almost $US100 million ($A106.8 million) for people suffering with the condition better known as Lou Gehrig's Disease since it kicked off in late July.

And while countless videos of celebrities, public figures and ordinary people have flooded the internet over the past month it has been hard to tell how this viral video campaign spread so far so quickly.

Until now.

David Hooker, a content manager who works for Hungarian presentation software company Prezi, created a detailed interactive that tracks the Ice Bucket Challenge from its inception in Florida to its spread throughout Hollywood.

The challenge started with Charles Kennedy, a golfer from Florida, who was responding to a friend who told him 'pour ice over your head and I'll donate to the charity of your choice'

The challenge started with Charles Kennedy, a golfer from Florida, who was responding to a friend who told him 'pour ice over your head and I'll donate to the charity of your choice'.

He chose ALS because his cousin is a sufferer of the disease.

He then challenged his cousin's wife, and the challenges eventually reached New York-based ALS activist Pat Quinn who documents his battle with the disease on the website Quinn 4 The Win.

Through Mr Quinn's network it spread to former Boston college baseball player Pete Frates, also an ALS sufferer, whose friend Corey Griffin reportedly raised $US100,000 on behalf of his friend before he died in tragic diving accident almost two weeks ago.

After the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge spread around Boston sports teams, Giselle Bundchen (model and wife of New England Patriots player Tom Brady) took part

The challenge then spread around athletes all over Boston including New England Patriots player Julian Edelman.

He nominated teammate Tom Brady, and it eventually spread to his model wife Giselle Bundchen as well as singer Justin Timberlake.

From there, it exploded.

Bundchen challenged US Vogue editor Anna Wintour, photographer Mario Testino and pop star Shakira.

Justin Timberlake was also one of the first celebrities to take part in the challenge

Tom Hanks captioned an ice bucket video of himself shared on Facebook as 'Who Dares Wins. Hanx.'  

Since then celebrities including James Franco, David Beckham, Selena Gomez, Ryan Seacrest, Taylor Swift, Gwyneth Paltrow, Lena Dunham, Emma Stone and Ben Affleck have been nominated to do the challenge and they've all taken part.

Although the rules state you either donate to ALS or pour an ice bucket over your head, many have done both, and the awareness raised by the celebrities' videos has translated into millions of dollars for the ALS Association.

On Wednesday an association spokeswoman, Carrie Munk, told AP the trick now is figuring out how to spend the windfall wisely. Research, care and advocacy are the group's three main missions.

'We realise there are responsibilities that come with being good stewards of these dollars,' she said.

Reese Witherspoon did the challenge for her friend Nanci who was just diagnosed with ALS
