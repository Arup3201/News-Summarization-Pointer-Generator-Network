Thousands of British troops may have withdrawn from Afghanistan after the 13-year conflict came to an end last October.

But demand for traditional English food has remained sky-high and one entrepreneur has capitalised on this by opening British-style chippy Mr Cod in war-torn Kabul.

The fish and chips shop, which is the first of its kind in the country, is the brainchild  of Afghan-Canadian entrepreneur Bashir Halimi.

He said bringing a British flavour to the country battered by more than a decade of conflict would 'serve a new taste, the taste of the UK, to the Afghan public'.

'Fish, and chips, are both common in Afghanistan, but I wanted to serve them in a better quality, to international standards,' said the 29-year-old, who opened the business a week ago.

The food is served wrapped in paper and a large picture of a fish adorns the wall along with an aquarium which boasts colourful live fish.

A wide-screen television shows Afghan music videos and blue and white balloons hang from the ceiling. In one corner is a small play section for children.

'Customers seem to be happy so far. The number of the guests has increased since we opened,' said Mr Halimi, who studied business in Vancouver.

The restaurant is priced to attract middle-class Afghans with the average medium meal costing 240 Afghanis (£2.73)

It is currently attracting around 250 customers per day, mostly local young people and families.

'I am not expecting profit for now. My rent is 6,000 dollars per month and I also have 22 employees to pay.'

'Once people knew about it, I will earn by increasing the number of the customers not raising prices,' Mr Halimi told dalje.com.

He has invested $400,000 (£259,000) in the restaurant and is hoping to open up other outlets.

Diner Abdul Qader, 53, said: 'I will come here at least twice a week with my family and friends. 

"The food here is tasty and they have a good service.'

Foreign-style restaurants have boomed in the capital since the ousting of the Taliban in the 2001 US-led invasion, despite repeated attacks on establishments frequented by expats.
