A drunken asylum seeker who killed a model in a head on crash as he drove the wrong way down a motorway was jailed for eight years today.

Rebecca Caine, 20, was thrown from a friend's car and died instantly after Wilfred Museka ignored no entry signs and drove east along the west bound carriageway of the M62 near Rochdale in Greater Manchester.

His Renault Megane ploughed into the Chevrolet Matiz car which was taking Miss Caine and three friends back to their homes in Leeds after a night out clubbing in central Manchester in September.

Museka, 31, from Clayton, Manchester, had earlier been to a party where he had drunk cans of lager and rum and Red Bull.He was over twice the legal limit when he gave a blood sample over an hour after the accident.

He pleaded guilty at Manchester Crown Court to causing death by dangerous driving, driving with no insurance or valid licence and driving with excess alcohol.

Judge Adrian Smith told him: ' No sentence can possible reflect the loss of the life of Becky - a young, bright and hugely popular young woman who was about to finish her University education.

'She had a bright and happy future to look forward to and you have left a huge hole in the lives of her family. This was a flagrant disregard of the basic rules of motoring caused by your inability to exercise any judgement through the consumption of large amounts of alcohol.'

The court heard that father of two Museka came to the UK in 2000 and claimed political asylum which he was granted until 2016 when his case will be reviewed.

Members of Miss Caine's family wept as prosecutor Tina Landale told the court that Becky was not wearing a seat belt in the rear of the Chevrolet which was driven by friend Parvinder Singh.

Rebecca Caine was a back seat passenger in the Chevrolet suffered fatal injuries in the impact and died at the scene

She was sitting in the rear with another friend when the car was struck by Museka's Renault which was travelling at around 70mph in the wrong direction in the central lane.

Museka had driven past no entry signs on the slip road at Littleborough near Rochdale and had ignored the warnings from a broken down motorist who shone his torch and waved his arms to attract his attention.

He had travelled 1.5 miles at around 70mph when the front of his car hit the rear of Mr Singh's car as it tried to avoid a collision.

Miss Caine's mother Susan said: 'Becky had many plans for the future and was just starting out on her adult life.'

Miss Caine was thrown through the rear nearside window as the car rotated after the impact toward the central reservation of the motorway.

Miss Landale told the court: 'Her body was seen to fly through the air and hit the ground. The rearside of the Chevrolet drove over body. The passengers in the Chevrolet could see her blonde hair on the carriageway.

Miss Caine's father Timothy said: 'We miss her smile, her love and her carefree attitude.'

Museka told police at the scene: 'I do not know what happened. I was driving and then - bang.'

The insurance company worker said he could not explain why he was on the motorway as he had been to a party in Openshaw, Manchester, and lived in Clayton a short distance away.

In a victim impact statement, Miss Caine's mother Susan said: 'Becky had many plans for the future and was just starting out on her adult life. She was a beautiful young woman inside and out. It has totally devastated our family.'

Miss Caine's father Timothy in his victim impact statement said: 'She attracted people to her with her infectious laugh and beaming smile. We have lost a daughter and a beautiful shining light.

'We miss her smile, her love and her carefree attitude. There are some people in life who are very special and Rebecca was one of those people.'

Nicola Gatto, defending, said Museka was 'consumed with regret and remorse' for the death and for the 'considerable pain' he knew he had caused his victimâ€™s family.

'He is living in a never ending nightmare but he does not ask for sympathy or pity. He realises that nothing he can say can bring adequate solace to the family.'
