A police officer was forced to smash a woman's car window after she passed out drunk and came to a halt while driving along a highway.

Amber Dlaine McKinney Morgan, 25, was heading north on the I-805 in San Diego, California, at around 1am on Friday when she fell asleep at the wheel.

California Highway Patrol arrived at the scene and tried to get into the vehicle, but when the woman woke she took her foot off the brake, and the car started to roll.

Extraordinary footage captured by ABC 10 shows the officer running alongside the vehicle shouting 'stop, stop' at the woman before smashing the glass on the passenger side.

He then opes the door and turns the emergency brake on to stop it from moving any further.  

When officers searched the car, they allegedly found a bottle of liquor and a collection of other drinks.

They arrested McKinney Morgan on suspicion of drunk driving.

She was booked into LCDRF Las Colinas Detention and Reentry Facility in Santee, California, and is being held on $250 bail. 

The authorities were forced to close several lanes on the highway to avoid other motorists hitting the stopped car or their officers who were on the road dealing with the situation.
