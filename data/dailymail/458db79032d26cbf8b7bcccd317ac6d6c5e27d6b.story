In an age where women are liberated, have choices and careers and (better) economic equality, why are we still putting up with men behaving badly?

What’s with Kim Kardashian putting up with new dad Kanye’s blatant unavailability - both emotional and physical - when he should be beaming by her side, being proud and protective.

Rihanna giving Chris Brown a zillion second chances when she has visual evidence - her smashed up face - of what ‘love’ means to him.

Simon Cowell’s mini-tribe of exes all sobbing that they should have been the one to father his love child. Why exactly? Yes, I get the yacht/jet/diamond appeal but seriously, who really wants to spend their life with a man who collects their exes rather than puts them in the past, where exes are supposed to be.

Why is Cara Delevingne sniffing around Kate Moss’s ex Pete Doherty? What am I missing?

Yes, we should all be entitled to make and learn from our mistakes but what message is this sending teenage girls, who we know are obsessed with celebrity?

What’s wrong with going for the nice guy?

Women have always been brainwashed into the appeal of the ‘bad boy’.

The drama of it all is seen as exciting. There’s the ‘hot’ make-up sex after the fights; the heady rebellion of going for someone who only thinks about now, doesn’t care about the future.

When you’re 18 and tentatively exploring life and sex and relationships, this can be appealing.

But as an adult, who can be bothered with the reality of dating a guy who’s never on time (if he bothers turning up at all), who has no money, drug or alcohol problems, an inability to plan ahead, an allergic reaction to a mere whiff of commitment, no real goals or ambition and loathes your friends and family (but not half as much as they loathe him).

My definition of a bad guy is this: it’s someone who doesn’t treat you nicely.

The stereotype that nice equals weak is false. Studies show nice people are not necessarily less assertive or competitive than ‘difficult’ people.

Tracey says women have been 'brainwashed' into liking bad boys and that nice doesn't equal boring

‘Nice is boring’ also doesn’t stand up to scrutiny.

Unless ‘boring’ means calling when they’re supposed to and being where they’re supposed to be, with the person they’re supposed to be with.

‘Nice is average looking’ is shot to smithereens by Jon Hamm topping Sexiest Man Alive polls worldwide and also being a nice guy.

‘Nice’ isn’t just an throwaway word by the way: it’s measurable.

Psychologists define nice people as those who score high on a personality trait called agreeableness.

If you’re nice, your over-riding concern is having happy, positive relationships with other people.

You like harmony and you don’t like upsetting people.

Nice people are generous, trustworthy, reliable and considerate.

They don’t play games because they don’t like to make other people feel uncomfortable.

The ability to be able to ‘put yourself in someone else’s shoes’ or ‘see how your partner sees’ is a hugely positive factor in relationships. This is the automatic default for the average nice guy.

Studies show agreeable people also stay married longer, are more intimate in their marriages, have better relationships with their kids and - not surprisingly - are more satisfied with their lives overall.

Case closed for any female who has even a hint of intelligence and high self-esteem.
