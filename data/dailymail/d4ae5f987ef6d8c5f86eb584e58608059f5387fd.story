On a typical day, in the height of summer, around 30,000 flights travel through European airspace.

To showcase the complex and detailed routes these flights take, and how they manage to fly across the continent without crashing into each other, NATS (formerly known as the National Air Traffic Services) has created a beautiful timelapse video.

This video tracks the movement of flights over the course of 24 hours last summer and has been condensed to just two minutes.

The visualisation, pictured, was created by the UK air traffic controller NATS (formerly known as the National Air Traffic Services). It used UK radar data from June last year, combined with European flight plan information from July, to showcase a day's worth of air travel in just two minutes

The data visualisation is an amalgamation of UK radar data, taken on 21 June 2013, combined with European flight plan information from 28 July last year.

Paul Beauchamp, a NATS spokesman, told MailOnline: 'Airspace is an incredibly valuable asset - just as important as the rail, road and utility networks that everyone relies on everyday.

However, most people aren’t aware of the work that goes into managing and safely guiding aircraft through our skies.

'That’s why we created this visualisation to highlight the complexity of that work, the skill of our air traffic controllers and the UK’s strategic importance as the aviation gateway to Europe and North America.'

To create the video, viualisation experts from a company called 422 South combined 24 hours worth of flight radar data from all UK flights on one of the busiest days of last year, and blended it with flight schedules and routing information for the rest of Europe - reaching out into the North Atlantic.    

On 21 June 2013, 5,675 aircraft departed or arrived from UK airports, this included 847 from Gatwick and 1,041 from Heathrow. The rest travelled to and from other UK airports. A total of 1,532 were classed as overflights, which travelled over the country. This still from the video shows the level of traffic around Heathrow and Gatwick during a single morning

Computer artists then used specially 
developed programmes to convert the longitude, latitude and height data 
into luminous dots, which were accurately positioned over satellite 
images of Britain and mainland Europe, by day and by night.  

Beauchamp
 continued: 'European airspace is some of the busiest and most complex 
anywhere in the world. Every day thousands of air traffic controllers 
guide millions of passengers safely to their destinations.

'Yet
 to most people, the choreography going on above them is entirely 
unnoticed - it quite literally goes over their heads. Some might say 
that is how it should be. But, that ignores one very important point. Getting it right matters and we all have a stake in it.'

According to NATS, of the 30,000 flights that travel across European airspace on a typical July day, approximately a quarter fly within UK controlled airspace.

This data also extended into the North Atlantic, pictured. Computer artists then used specially developed programmes to convert the longitude, latitude and height data into luminous dots, which were accurately positioned over satellite images of Britain and mainland Europe, by day and by night

The total distance flown by these 
aircraft is 25 million nautical miles - the equivalent to 998 
times around the Earth or 104 trips to the Moon.

were classed as overflights which travelled over the country. The NATS video is 1440x faster than real time.

'A few highlights include the North Atlantic tracks that connect Europe with North America, the airways that run up the spine of the UK, the holding stacks at London's capacity stretched airports and the military manoeuvres off Anglesey in Wales,' said NATS in a blog post.

NATS is the main air navigation service provider for the UK that provides air traffic control services to flights within the UK Flight Information Regions as well as the Shanwick Oceanic Control Area.

It also provides traffic control to fifteen airports in the UK airports, plus Gibraltar Airport.
