Liverpool have paid tribute to Steven Gerrard's glittering 16-year career at the club with a commemorative programme cover of him for their game against Stoke City on Saturday.

Gerrard, who made his debut for the Reds as a substitute against Blackburn Rovers on November 29 1998, is a club legend among the Anfield faithful.

The veteran midfielder has won the likes of the Champions League, three League Cups and two FA Cups during his glorious stint so far with his boyhood club.

He still remains an ever-present in the current Liverpool side, with Brendan Rodgers still regarding him as an integral part of his first-team squad.

Liverpool's programme cover this weekend includes images of him throughout his career at the club, with the main inset of him in the current day, as well as some from his time as a youngster at the club and memorable moments - such as the thrilling comeback in Istanbul to win the Champions League in 2005.

In the past week a number of Gerrard's team-mates have paid tribute to him in the build-up to the historic landmark, with vice-captain and fellow midfielder Jordan Henderson hailing the former England midfielder. 

Henderson told FATV: 'I'd have to say Steven Gerrard has been my biggest influence in my career so far.

'I watched him when I was younger and then to go and play and train with hime every day was massive for me, and still is now.'

Summer signing Emre Can has also been hugely complimentary of the Reds skipper, labelling him as his 'big brother'.

Can said: 'He is the greatest captain the club have ever had - it's as simple as that. 

'And I feel comfortable on the pitch because I always know Gerrard is ­behind me. If I make a mistake he is helping me out.

 'He is like a big brother looking out for me if something goes wrong. 

'He isn't in the team just because his name is Steven Gerrard – he's there because he brings performances on the pitch.'

The 34-year-old will have no problem looking back on memorable moments in his career when he finally hangs up his boots.

Whether that be prompting his side's heroic comeback in Istanbul against AC Milan in May 2005 to lift the club's fifth-ever European crown or his stunning last-gasp equaliser against West Ham in the FA Cup final  at the Millennium Stadium as they won on penalties to lift the Cup just a year later - before later being awarded an MBE for his services to the game. 

The word legend gets thrown around too loosely in the modern age in football, but Gerrard is certainly one of those and Liverpool are rightly paying tribute to their inspirational captain this weekend, as they look to get their season right back on track.
