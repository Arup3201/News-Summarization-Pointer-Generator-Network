Concerns have been raised after one of Britain's best loved steam trains was filmed during a trip apparently on fire.

Fears were raised after a video was caught on webcam showing Tangmere passing through Dawlish in Devon on Sunday in flames.

The video shows the heritage locomotive speeding through the resort with what appear to be orange flames and smoke pouring out of the driver's cab.

Fire or a trick of the light? YouTube video looks like the train is on fire

One person even commented about the flames on a YouTube video showing the incident, posting: 'Yowch!!!!! I really hope the crew weren't too badly injured in this!

'Something tells me the poor sods may have had a trip to A&E. No way anyone could escape the amount of flames ripping their way through the cab!

'I wonder how they got that under control too? It looks to be flickering up on the drivers (sic) side. Some poor beggar would have to get close enough to either shut the firebox doors or something else?'

However, the operators of the train The Railway Touring Company, said that this was not the case.

Rachel Jackson, Operations Manager, said: 'There was no fire, no one was hurt and the locomotive owners believe it was a trick of the light through the camera.'

Tangmere is one of the Battle of Britain class locomotives.

It was completed in 1947 at Brighton Works and named after a military airfield in Sussex and was for use across the entire Southern Railway.

The Battle of Britain class were built post war, in a tight financial climate, and as a result of this were amongst the first to be fitted with steel fire boxes instead of copper.

Tangmere was used on both freight and passenger trains until withdrawal in November 1963 after covering almost 700,000 miles.

Rescued from Barry Scrapyard in 1980, from which 213 steam locomotives were saved for preservation, Tangmere moved through various bases during its restorations until finally returning to mainline steam in 2003.

Was the train on fire as it rushed through the resort of Dawlish in Devon?

The locomotive has 3 cylinders, 6 driving wheels and a firebox of almost 40ft2 and is currently painted in Brunswick Green.

While limited to 75 mph, Tangmere is capable of a top speed around 100mph.

The railway line at Dawlish was wrecked by storm earlier this year and it took weeks of work by a 300-strong team to repair it
