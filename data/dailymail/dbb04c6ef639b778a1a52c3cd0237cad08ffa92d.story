Andros Townsend has pleaded with manager Mauricio Pochettino to keep him in the side against Burnley in the FA Cup third round – so that 2015 can be the year he finally makes himself a Tottenham first-team regular.

Townsend, whose spectacular goals helped England to qualify for the World Cup, but whose 2014 was blighted by an ankle injury which caused him to miss the World Cup, scored for Spurs on Thursday night in the spectacular 5-3 win over Chelsea, the first time he has started successive Premier League games under Pochettino.

And even though the Argentinian is likely to make changes to the team that beat Chelsea so comprehensively, Townsend hopes he is not among them. He has been a regular in the Capital One Cup and Europa League but now wants a long run of games to convince Pochettino that his future remains at Spurs.

‘That’s the aim,’ said Townsend. ‘I’ve played the last two Premier League games. I cannot remember the last time I did that. I’m not looking for a rest and I want to play every game I can and stake a claim for a regular place.

‘Everyone wants to play 90 minutes every game but you have to accept that’s not going to happen. I have played in every cup game and that has helped me build up my confidence. Hopefully I can get a run in the Premier League side and stay there.

‘I’ve been here since the age of eight. If I can stay at Spurs and get a run in the Premier League team then of course I don’t want to look anywhere else. I have played the last two Premier League games so that’s where my focus is and doing well for Spurs.

The 23-year-old is confident that his injury problems are now behind him

‘For the manager to trust you and to throw you in against two of the best teams shows great confidence. Hopefully I can repay that faith in me. He is happy with how things are going. You can see that as I have played the last two games he is not looking to ship me out at the first opportunity. That has given me confidence and hopefully now I can get a run in the team and show what everyone what I’m capable of.’

Pochettino says that Townsend is too important to the squad to be allowed to leave and the player himself is convinced that now his injury problems are over he will rediscover the form which in the autumn of 2013 saw him hailed as one of the most exciting English talents in the Premier League. An ankle injury in April meant he missed the World Cup and disrupted his start to this season.

‘2014 was not a good year for me with form, fitness and injuries,’ said Townsend. ‘Hopefully I’m over the worse of it now and the performances are going to be better and I can get back to the form I had in 2013. I’m not going to look back. You can’t do that. But injuries did come at the wrong time. Now that’s over and in the past, it’s a new year and new start.’

Tottenham travel to Burnley on Sunday for the FA Cup third round, a repeat of the 1962 Final, which Spurs won 3-1. Despite struggling for form at times, they have now lost just two of their last twelve games. They are in the Capital One Cup semi, the Europa League last 32 and sit fifth in the Premier League, two points off Champions League qualification.

‘We’ve got great confidence from our league form in recent weeks,’ said Townsend. ‘Everyone wants that to continue. The Christmas period is a tough time anyway but to play Manchester United and Chelsea back-to-back is extremely difficult. So we will take heart from that going into our next game.

‘We have a big squad. We have seen this season we have rotated in the Europa League and Capital One Cup competitions. We have a squad who can challenge in four competitions in on four fronts.’
