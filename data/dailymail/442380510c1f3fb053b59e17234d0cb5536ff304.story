This is the moment a brand new fleet of Ford cars were wrecked after a transporter driver's unfortunate short-cut ended with him becoming wedged under a low bridge.

The  driver had attempted to take a quicker route to avoid queuing traffic when he collided with a 14.5ft (4.4m) high bridge.

Witnesses described hearing a 'crunch' as the top tier of five brand new Ford Focus cars, which had not yet had the chance to clock up a single mile, were virtually flattened in the crash.
