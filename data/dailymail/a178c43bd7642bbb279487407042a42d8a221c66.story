The masked intruder knocked on the door of the newsagents in Wootton, Bedfordshire and forced the shopkeeper to empty the shop's safe

Detective Inspector Jerry Waite said: 'This was a terrifying experience for the member of staff who feared that she was going to be seriously harmed if she did not empty the safe.'

The raid took place at around 7.45am at Dillon’s Newsagents in Cause End Road, Wootton. 

The member of staff was expecting a delivery when she heard a knock at the back door.

When she opened it, she was confronted by a man armed with what appeared to be a handgun.

The man, who appeared to be carrying a handgun, fled from the store with 'a substantial amount' of cash. In CCTV released by police, he is seen wearing grey jogging bottoms and a hooded top

He marched her into the store’s office and forced her to empty the safe. After he left through the back door, the worker set off a panic alarm.

CCTV showed the man arriving at the shop on a unique-looking silver and red mountain bike. 

The man was wearing a mask, grey jogging bottoms and a hooded top with two stripes down the arm and the number 53 on the front. 

DI Waite said: 'Wootton is a close knit community and I hope that someone will recognise the clothing being worn or the bike being ridden by the offender who escaped with a substantial amount of cash.'
