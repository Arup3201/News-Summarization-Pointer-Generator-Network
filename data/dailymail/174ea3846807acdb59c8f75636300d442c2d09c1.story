Animal behaviour experts had warned that this morning’s eclipse could make owls more alert, sheep feel sleepy and change the flight of moths.

And while some animal lovers have taken to Twitter to describe how their cat ‘went nuts’ or dog looked confused, some say pets and farm animals didn’t react at all to the astronomical phenomenon.

The partial eclipse saw skies across the UK darken at around 9.30am as the moon travelled in front of the sun, casting a shadow over Earth.

Before the event, Dave Clarke, Head of Invertebrates at ZSL London told MailOnline: ‘A solar eclipse, especially a full eclipse, could affect the flight of nocturnal moths and diurnal butterflies - who use the light for navigation.’

While the zoo had prepared by amending the lighting slightly in Butterfly Paradise, it said that in the end, it was ‘pretty underwheming’ with no strange behaviour seen.

An expert from ZSL London told MailOnline that the eclipse could affect the flight of nocturnal moths and diurnal butterflies (an owl butterfly is shown)

This may be because the skies of London were grey and cloudy.

The Royal Zoological Society Scotland said there was also no unusual activity at Edinburgh Zoo either.

However, many people took to Twitter to say it was eerily quiet during the eclipse, with birds falling silent, as predicted.

RizkeyG in Staffordshire, tweeted: ‘It went cold and dark and the wind changed. There were no birds flying, then they started to tweet again in the trees. Brilliant #eclipse’, while Robert Thompson said: ‘Eclipse is weird even though cloudy the sky has almost a lilac haze, the birds have gone and the wind has stopped eerie out there.’

Kitty Gallannaugh in London said: 'It's just kind of dusky flat light here and all the birds have gone silent. It's eerily peaceful!', to which Laura Amy replied: 'There is a hazy feel to everything, no birds flying and no wind at all! Very eerie.'

Donald Broom, Emeritus Professor of Animal Welfare at the University of Cambridge, told MailOnline earlier this week that the most people would notice that many of the common birds stop singing and some may move to higher perches or more secluded spots to feel safer.

'Farm animals out in the fields might stop grazing and move to a more sheltered place as they do at night,' he said, before adding that because all animals have 24 hour body clocks, they know it is not night time but that something unusual is going on,’ he added.

A Twitter user called €va said: ‘It's REALLY calm. No animals make sounds out there. It's STILL, like NATURE is holding its breath. :-) #eclipse The mood is ODD’ and Yvonneridley tweeted: ‘Animals on farm are acting a bit weird #eclipse’.

Professor Broom also said that pet dogs and cats would probably be 'slightly disturbed' by the eclipse and some Twitter users seem to have confirmed his theory.

‘They'll notice it will get dark,' he said before adding: 'Although night happens every day, you don't have a substantial change in light intensity in the morning, so it's a bit disturbing for them.'

He predicted that dogs would probably be more alert and pay more attention to what's going on around them more than usual because they will be 'slightly surprised'.

There were reports of pet dogs howling and running around on Twitter, although Battersea Dogs and Cats Home in London ‘saw absolutely no changes in behaviour in our animals’.

Kat Williams tweeted: ‘Did anyone else's animals get proper weird over the eclipse? Rachel [a dog] was chewing the armchair & generally acting like a little weirdo, to which Jason A Leaman replied: ‘Our hens went to bed!’ 

Zoos in London, Chester and Edinburgh said that animals did not behave particularly strangely during the eclipse, but these lemurs at Chester Zoo, seem to be admiring the strange sight

Professor Broom also said that pet dogs and cats would probably be 'slightly disturbed' by the eclipse and some Twitter users seem to have confirmed his theory, however, this dog waiting for the event with its eclipse glasses on, looks quite relaxed

The eclipse saw up to 84 per cent of the sun covered in London and around 94 per cent in Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh. A partial eclipse was visible across Europe, North Africa and Russia for about 90 minutes. This suggests that animals living nearer the arctic circle  reacted more strongly but this is hard to prove

Charlotte Vermeulen, a biologist at the Artis Zoo in Amsterdam told Nasa that animals tend to act strangely when the sky turns dark, because they are disorientated by the sudden appearance of ‘night-time’. For example, sheep (stock image) may find a place to sleep tomorrow

Projection: Place a pinhole or small opening in a card, and hold it between the sun and a screen – giant sheet of white paper works – a few feet away.

Filters: The sun can be viewed directly only when using filters specifically designed for this purpose. Such filters have a thin layer of aluminum, chromium or silver on the surfaces.

Telescopes with solar filters: There are sun-specific telescopes available for sale - or perhaps through a local astronomy club - that are also safe for viewing a partial eclipse. 

However, other pet owners were underwhelmed by their animals’ response to the partial eclipse.

Hand Troleman in Aberdeen, where the eclipse was meant to be more striking, tweeted: ‘Not gonna lie was expecting more from the eclipse: total darkness, folk walking into lampposts, animals howling, the end times being upon us and Pokusevski's, a deli in Salford said: ‘They say animals can feel solar eclipse. Don't think my cats are bothered,’ along with a picture of two ginger cats relaxing. 

Charlotte Vermeulen, a biologist at the Artis Zoo in Amsterdam told Nasa that animals tend to act strangely when the sky turns dark, because they are disorientated by the sudden appearance of ‘night time’. 

She said: 'Diurnal animals - those that are awake during the day - do what they usually do at night: sleep!

‘Dragonflies hide under a leaf, ants return to their nest, sheep walk back to their sleeping place, cattle egrets (heron-like birds) return to their nocturnal roost, diurnal grasshoppers chirp more slowly and then stop.’

‘Nocturnal animals become active: owls hoot, bats fly, blackbirds sing like they do in the early morning, cocks crow, nocturnal grasshoppers start chirping, and so on.’ 

It was also predicted that bees may become more active during the partial eclipse, based on a study conducted in India.

Experts at the Zoological Survey of India studied rock bees during an eclipse in June 1955 and found that when the sun was hidden behind the moon, 150 bees buzzed out of a hive, instead of the normal 25 or so, The Atlantic reported. 

‘It would appear that during the partial solar eclipse on the 20th June, the rock bees became distinctly restless and more active,’ ML Roonwall, who led the study said.

During a partial eclipse in 2001, desert cicadas in Arizona fell silent in a break from their normal calling,but there have been no reports that similar insects like crickets, did the same in the UK.

Birds were reported to go silent during the partial eclipse, like the crow shown above in Bridgwater, Somerset

Many people took to Twitter to say it was eerily quiet during the eclipse, with birds falling silent, as predicted. Here, a group wear protective glasses as they watch the partial eclipse in Madrid

Experts think this may have happened because of a drop in temperature under the eclipse’s shadow and because calling takes a lot of energy, it was impossible for the insects to keep up their method of communication.

In 1973, researchers found that captive squirrels became restless in the run up to and during an eclipse. In the study, the animals increased the length of this ‘non-stop running sessions’. 

During a 2001 solar eclipse in Africa, self-proclaimed eclipse chaser, Todd Thompson witnessed strange animal behaviour in Zambia.

‘Nocturnal animals become active [during an eclipse]: Owls hoot, bats fly, blackbirds sing like they do in the early morning, cocks crow, nocturnal grasshoppers start chirping, and so on,’ one expert said

He said in a blog post that birds went to roost as the sky darkened, crickets and cicadas fell silent and even mosquitoes vanished. 

Paul Murdin, visiting professor of Astronomy at Liverpool John Moores University, collected observations from 250 members of Wildlife and Environment Zimbabwe (WEZ) during the same eclipse.

He wrote that hippos looked nervous and alert in a river, unsure if it was dawn or dusk and once the eclipse ended, there was a ‘crescendo of loud dawn chorus-like calls’ from turtle doves, after they had fallen silent though the event.

‘By contrast frogs in the river called at totality and ceased calling when the light reappeared,’ he wrote.

Observations of previous eclipses said nocturnal animals such as owls  become more active, while daytime creatures went to sleep
