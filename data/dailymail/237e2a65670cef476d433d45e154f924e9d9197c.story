David Cameron was today accused of making 'pathetic excuses' for not wanting to take part in TV debates during the election campaign.

Ed Miliband said the Prime Minister was 'frit' after joining Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage in insisting the Tories must not be allowed to block the clashes.

In an unprecedented alliance, the Labour, Lib Dem and Ukip leaders have written identical letters to Mr Cameron suggesting he be 'empty chaired' by broadcasters if he does not give ground.

Downing Street insists that the Green party should be allowed to take part, but this is being seen as an attempt to stop the debates happening at all.

Downing Street insists that the Green party should be allowed to take part, but this is being seen as an attempt to stop the debates happening at all. 

The Prime Minister said he would not sign up to a proposal from Britain's main broadcasters for the TV debates unless it was changed to include the Green Party. 

in bruising clashes in the Commons, Ed Miliband deployed Margaret Thatcher's famous barb by branding Mr Cameron 'frit'.

The Labour leader pointed out that in 2010 Mr Cameron had condemned 'feeble' reasons for backing out of debates, and said 'no-one believed'

his protests were genuine now.

'It is frankly a pathetic excuse. It is not for him, it is not for me, it is not for any party leader to decide who is in the debate. It is up to the broadcasters, that is the country we live in,' Mr Miliband said.

'Is he really telling the people of Britain that he is going to seek to deny them the TV debate if he doesn't get to choose who is in them?'

Mr Cameron hit back that Mr Miliband was 'chicken' for being unwilling to face off against Green Party leader Natalie Bennett as well as Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and Ukip's Nigel Farage.

'I'm all for these debates but you cannot have two minor parties without the third minor party. Why is he frightened of debating the Green Party?'

The debates form a traditional part of US Presidential elections, but critics say they risked sucking the life out of the wider campaign. 

In October the main broadcasters set out plans for three debates, with Ukip leader Nigel Farage offered a slot in one contest for the first time. 

Under the plans, Channel 4 and Sky News would host a debate between Mr Miliband and Mr Cameron, hosted by Jeremy Paxman.

The BBC is planning to host a debate, chaired by David Dimbleby, between Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg – a repeat of the three-way format seen in 2010.

ITV would host the four-way debate, including Mr Farage for the first time, chaired by ITV presenter Julie Etchingham.

But last week Mr Cameron ruled out taking part unless the Green leader Natalie Bennett was included.

When asked if it was correct that would not take part as it stands, Mr Cameron told ITV News: 'Correct.'

The Tories pushed for the debates to happen in 2010, when Mr Clegg was seen to have have triumphed over Mr Cameron and Gordon Brown

More than 20million people watched the TV debates in 2010, the first time political leaders had gone head-to-head in Britain. 

Today's letters to Mr Cameron point out that he had 'enthusiastically endorsed' the idea when in opposition.

Mr Miliband, Mr Clegg and Mr Farage add: 'I believe it would be a major setback to our democratic processes if these debates were not repeated in 2015 because of one politician's unwillingness to participate.

'I hope you will agree that the decision as to who should take part in the televised debates should not be in the hands of any party leader, each of whom inevitably has their own political interests to defend. It must be a decision independently and objectively arrived at.'

The leaders insisted the broadcasters were under strict obligations of political impartiality and had made an 'objective determination' about who should participate.

'While each of the other parties invited to take part in the debates has their own views on the proposal and the levels of participation offered and will continue to make their case in this regard, we all accept the independence and impartiality of the broadcasters and have committed to take part in the debates,' the letters added.

'It would be unacceptable if the political self-interest of one party leader were to deny the  public the opportunity to see their leaders debate in public.

'Therefore, if you are unwilling to reconsider, the three party leaders who have committed to participate will ask the broadcasters to press ahead with the debates and provide an empty podium should you have a last minute change of heart.

'These debates are not the property of the politicians and I do not believe the public will  accept lightly the prospect of any politician seeking to block them.'

Downing Street said its position on the debates 'hasn't changed', insisting any multi party format must include the Green party and should take place outside main election campaign.

A Conservative source said: 'It shows how desperate Miliband is to keep the Greens out - and stop them taking Labour votes - that he is prepared to team up with Nigel Farage and agree an identical letter they could both send.' 

Lib Dem election chief Lord Ashdown accused Mr Cameron of being 'frit'.

He told BBC Breakfast: 'Is it perfect for the Liberal Democrats? No, it's not, but in the interests of having these debates, we go ahead. 

'What Mr Cameron is trying to do is hold us to ransom because it's not in his interests to go ahead with the debate. The idea that it's about the Greens is complete nonsense.

'Mrs Thatcher had a word for this: it's that he's frit and that's exactly what it is. Can you imagine Mrs Thatcher refusing to go and debate and using the Greens as cover to do so? 

'I mean, even Gordon Brown, who didn't want to do this, in the end did it. So we can only draw the conclusion that Mr Cameron, frankly, has got less confident in his own ability to make his case than Gordon Brown had.'

Mr Farage insisted there was no regulatory barrier to broadcasting without Mr Cameron.

'It is pretty clear that from the BBC's own editorial guidelines, you would be within your rights to hold these debates whether Mr Cameron turned up or not,' he told Radio 4's Today. 

'In 2010 David Cameron did very badly in these debates and was seen to be the loser. And I have seen this week that he has launched the six main priorities for the Conservatives' general election campaign and he has completely ignored the issues of Europe and immigration.

'I feel very strongly he would rather not debate these things with me on national television.'

A chicken hired to chase Tony Blair over his refusal to take part in a TV debate with John Major almost defected to Labour after seeing the party's leader close up, it emerged today.

Former Conservative party aide Daniel Finkelstein said the actor hired to dress as a chicken was so impressed by Mr Blair during their encounters there were fears he would jump ship.

Now a Tory peer and columnist, Lord Finkelstein made the revelation has proof that voters will take little notice of whether David Cameron takes part in the debate or not, adding: 'After all, even the chicken himself was resolutely unimpressed.'

The Tory party hired a chicken in 1997 to stalk Tony Blair over his refusal to take in a TV debate with John Major

Writing in The Times, Lord Finkelstein said that in 1997 the Conservative party hired an actor to dress up as a chicken and follow Mr Blair around. 

'Unfortunately, the more the actor saw of Mr Blair, the more he liked him. And so the idea took hold that the chicken might, as it were, cross the road. 

'This would have been a PR disaster even greater than having involved ourselves in such a stupid stunt in the first place.

'So I was given a job. I was to have lunch with the chicken on a regular basis and keep him onside. I proved myself worthy of the trust placed in me.'
