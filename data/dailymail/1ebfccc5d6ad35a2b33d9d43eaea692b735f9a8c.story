There has been an intriguing fall-out from Inter Milan’s latest attempt to prise Bacary Sagna away from Arsenal, with suggestions in Italy that the experienced right-back may remain in the Barclays Premier League but not at The Emirates.

After tieing up the signing of Manchester United centre-back Nemanja Vidic on a two-year contract with an option for a further 12 months, Inter have turned their attention to recruiting a full-back, central midfielder and striker in an effort to spark an overdue revival in their fortunes.

Sagna is their first choice to fill the full-back position, and Sportsmail understands a delegation from the San Siro visited London in the last few days for negotiations about a summer move.

Linking up: Inter have already snapped up Manchester United stalwart Nemanja Vidic for their new back-line

They left disappointed, and the talk 
in Milan is that Sagna will either sign a new deal with Arsenal or join 
another Premier League club, with Chelsea and Tottenham being mentioned.

Galatasaray have not 
given up hope, but a source close to Inter said: ‘The impression that 
came out of the talks was that Sagna and his wife are settled in London 
and want to stay there.

He
 is hoping Arsenal come up with an acceptable offer, but there is 
interest from other Premier League clubs. We are hearing Chelsea and 
Tottenham.’ After securing Vidic’s signature, Inter have distanced 
themselves from claims they may move for Arsenal defender Thomas 
Vermaelen.

Hands up: The right-back could yet stay at the Emirates and sign a new deal

Politics could 
play a part in Arsenal’s pursuit of Julian Draxler after his club 
Schalke found themselves caught up in the escalating crisis over 
Russia’s military movements in Crimea.

While
 the rest of Europe condemns Russia’s involvement in eastern Ukraine and
 calls for tough sanctions against Vladimir Putin’s regime, Schalke’s 
top brass continue to enjoy a close relationship with the Russian 
president.

The 
Bundesliga club have been sponsored by Gazprom since January, 2007 and 
wear the Russian government-backed gas company’s name across the front 
of their shirts, much to the dismay of not only Greenpeace activists but
 leading German politicians.

Increasingly,
 influential political figures in Germany are calling on Schalke to cut 
their ties with Gazprom, so far to no avail.

Schalke
 chairman Clemens Toennies admitted he has a direct line to Putin, and 
is on friendly terms with the Russian leader, but was adamant he will do
 all he can to resist pressure to end the partnership: ‘Are we still 
friends? I am not a politician, but he shows his interest in our club by
 always asking about our results whenever we speak. It is a good 
relationship.’

However,
 with little indication political tension is about to ease over Russia’s
 activities in Ukraine, pressure is likely to mount on Schalke to seek 
alternative means of funding.

It
 can only have a destabilising effect on the Bundesliga club and 
increase Arsenal’s prospects of convincing Draxler he would benefit from
 a fresh start, when they resume their efforts to sign him in the 
summer.

Fernando Torres 
is not Chelsea’s only bargaining tool in their attempts to pep up their 
attack next season with the summer acquisition of Atletico Madrid 
striker Diego Costa.

A 
return to his former club and spiritual home could be on the cards for 
Torres, but Atletico are much more likely to be swayed into sanctioning 
Costa’s departure for Stamford Bridge if Thibaut Courtois was included 
in the deal.

And it 
does appear ever more likely that Courtois would be happy to go along 
with it. Now in his third season on loan at Atletico, he is so enamoured
 with the lifestyle over there that he has been going out with a Madrid 
girl for the past 12 months and has even bought a house in the Spanish 
capital.

Between the sticks: Atletico want to sign keeper Thibaut Courtois on a permanent deal

Chelsea have 
responded by offering him contract talks, but the outcome of those could
 hinge on his prospects of being installed as first choice ahead of Petr
 Cech.

Sportsmail 
understands the Belgian keeper may ask for a guarantee that he will 
start as number one next season before committing himself to a new 
improved deal.

If that 
proves a stumbling block, he knows he can count on just such an 
understanding at Atletico, where his place has never been in doubt. ‘My 
future is unclear, and I do need to sit down with Jose Mourinho and 
discuss it,’ he admitted.

With
 Nemanja Vidic bound for Inter Milan and Rio Ferdinand possibly heading 
for retirement, Thomas Vermaelen could provide a short-term solution to 
Manchester United manager David Moyes’ defensive requirements after 
stalling over the offer of contract talks at Arsenal. 

Moyes
 is scouring the market for top-quality candidates who can serve 
United’s defence for years to come but may consider Vermaelen’s wealth 
of experience a useful addition to the ranks.

The
 Belgium defender, who can operate at centre-half or left-back, shares 
the same agent as Robin Van Persie and is a close friend of the United 
striker. Of even more interest to Moyes is the response Vermaelen gave 
to news that Arsenal are ready to begin discussions with him about 
renewing his agreement with them.

As
 he considered his lack of starting opportunities this season, due to 
the form of Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny, he said: ‘Now is not 
the time for talking about new contracts. We can speak after the season 
has finished. I did not expect to play as little as I have, but the two 
defenders in front of me have played well and maintained their fitness. I
 just have to accept that.’
