An anonymous Wikipedia editor may have tried to reveal David Petraeus's extramarital affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell.

In January, the biographer-turned-mistress appeared on the Daily Show to pitch her book about the CIA director titled 'All In.'

The day after 
Wikipedia editor Vanobamo created a page for the author, which is common practice on the user-contributed online encyclopedia. 

But less than an hour later an anonymous editor logged on to the website and wrote: 'Petraeus is reportedly one of her many conquests.'

Confident: Paula Broadwell appeared on The Daily Show with John Stewart in January to promote the book

Accusation: On January 26, an anonymous editor logged on to Paula Broadwell's page on the website and wrote 'Petraeus is reportedly one of her many conquests'

It was 
the anonymous user's first and only Wikipedia edit, reports Gawker.

Their post, with the IP address 64.101.72.113, was deleted 
within an hour by editor Dsutton, who flagged it as 'libel/vandalism.'

At the time news of their affair had 
not surfaced and Wikipedia reserves the right to delete libelous 
material posted on the website. 

Public profile: Before last Friday Paula Broadwell's Wikipedia page was quite bare, but now it details her affair with former CIA director David Petraeus

Cringing: Looking back on it, Jon Stewart's interview with Paula Broadwell on The Daily Show was more than a little awkward

But now in hindsight, is unknown if Broadwell's Wikipedia outing was speculation by a Daily Show viewer, or if the poster had secret knowledge of Petraeus cheating on Holly his wife of 37 years

Since news of the posting was reelased, several attempts have been made to track the  IP address and determine the poster.

An IP address is an address assigned to every
computer and other devices are logged onto the  Internet to
uniquely define them.

Close: Broadwell first met Petraeus when he visited Harvard University, where she was a student

Face Time: Paula Broadwell and General David Petraeus

When Gawker ran it through the American 
Registry for Internet Numbers, they failed to come up with a name, but 
the result showed a company called Cisco Systems, Inc.

They explained that this means 'Cisco, the tech giant based in San Jose, was given that IP address, but anyone could have been using it, and it could have been ported to another location around the world.'

Before last Friday  Paula Broadwell's Wikipedia page was quite bare, but then former CIA director David Petraeus 
resigned.
