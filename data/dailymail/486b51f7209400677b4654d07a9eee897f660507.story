A cop killer on death row, who is set to be executed on Tuesday, has made an 11th-hour appeal not to be put to death after his defense lawyer admitted to downing vodka during his trial.

Robert Wayne Holsey was sentenced to death for shooting dead a sheriff's deputy, Will Robinson, in 1995 while he robbed a store in Milledgeville, Georgia. 

The killer had appealed for clemency after it emerged that his defense attorney was drinking a quart of vodka a day during his trial and later admitted  that he was in no fit state to represent anyone at the time.

Holsey's new legal team has argued that because his lawyer was an alcoholic, he never received adequate representation at trial.

The jury did not hear about Holsey's intellectual disability or his horrific childhood during his 1997 trail, according to NBC.

The killer's trial attorney was disbarred in 2006 because of his drinking problem and also for stealing from a client.  

Holsey's lawyer said that he will take his appeal to the high court if the clemency request is struck down by the parole board. 

The killer shot 26-year-old Deputy Robinson once in the right arm and once behind his right ear during a traffic stop following the robbery. 

He was arrested three hours later. The suspect was found guilty of all charges in February 1997 and sentenced to death.

Deputy Robinson is survived by his parents and two brothers.

On a memorial page for the fallen officer, his mother recently wrote: 'We are nearing the end of the 19-year journey through the State of GA and the US Justice Systems. 

'We have an execution date, December 9, 2014, and your family will be there to see end.'

She added: 'Closure? There is none. Ever. However we will finish the arduous appeals process and justice will be served. We will then celebrate the memories and happy times. Mom'
