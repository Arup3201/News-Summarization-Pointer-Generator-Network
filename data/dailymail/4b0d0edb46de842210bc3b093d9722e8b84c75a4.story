Pablo Zabaleta reckons Sergio Aguero can become Manchester City's first Ballon d'Or winner - but only if he can stay injury free.

The Argentina striker hit 19 goals in 20 games this season before suffering a knee ligament injury in December - the latest in a long line of setbacks.

And his international and club team-mate thinks that if he can repeat the form but not the setbacks he could be crowned the best footballer on the planet.

'Sergio is one of the best strikers in the world, for sure – he is in the top five,' Zabaleta told the Manchester Evening News as part of City in the Community's new Walking Football programme.’

'As a City player I would love to see one of our players get nominated for the Ballon d'Or, and we have a very strong squad with top players.

'We know that (four-times winner) Lionel Messi and (back-to-back winner) Cristiano Ronaldo are probably the best two in the world, and Real Madrid and Barcelona are very lucky to have them.

'But we also have very good players and if Aguero can keep 100 per cent fit for the whole season, he will have a chance to be there one day.'

Aguero was on the bench for City's 1-1 draw with Everton last weekend and is expected to start in Sunday's Premier League clash with Arsenal at the Etihad Stadium.

Zabaleta is also looking forward to the challenge of facing the Gunners' Alexis Sanchez, a player his own manager Manuel Pellegrini described as 'player of the moment'.

'He has had a very big impact on the Premier League, and has probably been Arsenal's main player,' he added.

'He is fast, his technical ability is fantastic and he scores and assists goals – the complete player.'
