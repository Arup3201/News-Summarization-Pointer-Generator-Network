This is the shocking moment a former Taiwanese marine kills a burglar after arriving home with his pregnant wife to find the intruder lurking in his bathroom.

He Bohai pinned the thief to the floor of the shower cubicle with a military hold after his 'training just took over' to protect his wife and unborn child.

He held the burglar in that position until the police arrived.

Officers, who took the photograph, found the intruder had fallen unconscious and he was later declared brain dead at hospital.

He Bohai was subsequently charged over the death - a decision that has provoked outrage across the country and from his relatives who have praised him for protecting his family.

'My training just took over and I floored him': A former Taiwanese marine pins a burglar to the floor in the shower cubicle after arriving home with his pregnant wife to find the intruder in his bathroom

There has been public outrage after He Bohai was arrested and charged for negligent manslaughter over the death which he claims was an instinctive act of self-defence to protect his wife (top left)

He, 29, had been out with his eight-months-pregnant wife Li Sun, 28, when they returned to their home in Beitou District of northern Taiwan's city of Taipei and spotted the thief in the bathroom.

He said: 'He came at us and there was no way I was letting him get past me to my wife. My training just took over and I floored him and put him in a military hold. 

'Once I had him restrained, I told her to call police and I kept him pinned down. 

'I didn't want to kill him but there was no way I was letting him go with my wife and our unborn child to protect.'

Police discovered that the man was unconscious by the time they arrived and was declared brain dead at hospital. 

His family have consented to turn off his life support machine.

After the story was posted online by local media, he was eventually granted a 50,000 Taiwanese dollar (£1,020) bail, but police have said he will still face trial

He was subsequently charged with negligent manslaughter. 

After the story was posted online by local media, he was eventually granted a 50,000 Taiwanese dollar (£1,020) bail, but police have said he will still face trial.

He's father said the whole family supported his son and added that they were proud of him for protecting his family.

A police spokesman said: 'A man was killed by another man, it is not up to the police to decide whether he is guilty. He will have to stand trial.'

But the former soldier has received massive support across the country after it was revealed the crook had known exactly whose family he was robbing. 

Video footage shows that he had been to the property several times to check out its potential as a target and then had finally broken in when he saw that the man and his wife were away.

But they came back earlier than he expected and the fight took place.
