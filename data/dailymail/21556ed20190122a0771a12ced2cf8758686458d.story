Celebrities may finally have a way to ward off unwanted street photographers' roving camera lenses once and for all thanks to a clever new clothing collection which is designed to ruin any images taken using flash photography.

Paul McCartney's DJ, Chris Holmes, has debuted The Anti-Paparazzi Collection, a line of reflective clothing that intentionally ruins shutterbugs' highly-coveted photos by deflecting the light from their cameras.

The collection includes a hooded jacket, an infinity scarf, and a blazer that look like everyday pieces, but essentially act as a mirror when hit with bright light, rendering the wearer practically invisible in flash photography.

Invisible man: Mr. Holmes said the line is 'perfect for those who don't want their picture taken'

Mr. Holmes said he was inspired to create the collection for Betabrand's Think Tank competition after he realized the reflective outfits he was wearing to his performances were causing the camera flashes to bounce off his clothing and wash out the pictures. 

'While I wasn't thrilled that many of these photos were ruined because of my clothing, it gave me the epiphany that perhaps I could use this technology for a greater purpose,' he wrote on the site.

'That's what lead me to create the Anti-Paparazzi Collection, which uses reflective threads to render paparazzi-shot photos worthless - perfect for those who don't want their picture taken.

The contest allows voters to decide which clothing items deserve to be funded and made.

Bright idea: The items look like everyday pieces, but essentially act as a mirror when hit with light, rendering the wearer practically invisible in flash photography.

Model off duty: Cara Delevingne tested out the Rochambeau 3M Paparazzi Blocker silver jacket back in November

The Anti-Paparazzi Collection is currently unavailable for purchase, but fans have 20 more days to vote for the item of their choice in the hopes that it will eventually make it onto shelves. 

And one person who will no doubt be thrilled to see the concept turned into a reality is trendsetting model Cara Delevingne, who is renowned for being one of the most photographed women in the world. 

In November, the model was actually spotted sporting a similar reflective silver coat, a one-of-a-kind design made especially for her. 

Page Six reported that the silver jacket, dubbed the Rochambeau 3M Paparazzi Blocker, was given to the star for testing to see whether it actually worked in the face of the world's most persistent paps.

Last spring, the 22-year-old took to Twitter to slam the London paparazzi, saying they 'act like they're assassins with their telescope lenses.'
