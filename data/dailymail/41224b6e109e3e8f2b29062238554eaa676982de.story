It has been a summer of bank breaking transfers. At almost all of Europe's major clubs, there has been a changing of the guard, and an expensive one too.

Barcelona have shelled out £75million for Luis Suarez, Real Madrid over £80million for James Rodriguez and Toni Kroos, and Manchester United and Liverpool have spent millions plundering Southampton.

In all the commotion, only Bayern Munich have remained quiet. And yet, In Robert Lewandowski, they appear to have pulled off the coup of the year.

Quality: Lewandowski has settled in well to life at new club Bayern Munich

Hot property: Luis Suarez is one of the best strikers in the world

Golden boy: James Rodriguez was outstanding at the World Cup

After a disappointing campaign for Barcelona last term it has been no surprise to see them therefore splash the cash, with the £75million purchase of Suarez the stand-out deal of the summer so far.

The former Liverpool striker brings his baggage but at the same time undisputed quality, and with Alexis Sanchez departing the Nou Camp for Arsenal, he'll provide timely assists and goals when he returns in November from his four-month ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini.

However, it was most certainly a surprise to see their arch-rivals spend £63million on Rodriguez. Granted, he had a superb World Cup with Colombia and was one of, if not the player of the tournament.

But with the plethora of attacking options at Carlo Ancelotti's disposal including the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema, there is no guarantee the former Monaco striker will be guaranteed of much first-team football at the Bernabeu.

Pedigree: The 25-year-old was outstanding for Borussia Dortmund during a four-year spell

Bearing in mind Madrid won the Champions League and Copa del Rey last season, it could be seen that the signing of Rodriguez is more a signal of intent to sent out to their rivals, rather than one that was a necessity.

So with that all mind Bayern could have come out of this with the top trump - that in being Robert Lewandowski on a free transfer. The 25-year-old had four prolific years at Borussia Dortmund and after rejecting their offer of a new contract in January, Bayern finally had their man after a four-year hunt.

After a league and cup double in Pep Guardiola's first season at the club Bayern could have been forgiven for letting their foot off the gas and sticking put with what they already have, but their capture of Lewandowski signals a real statement of intent and at a bargain price.

Prolific: Lewandowski has been a success on the international stage as well as domestically

Guardiola was clearly enchanted with Lewandowski. He said: 'He is a top, top player. He's just got everything. Congratulations to Bayern for signing him!'

£75m - Luis Suarez (Liverpool to Barcelona)

£60m - James Rodriguez (Monaco to Real Madrid)

£50m - David Luiz (Chelsea to PSG)

£32m - Diego Costa (Atletico Madrid to Chelsea)

£30m - Luke Shaw (Southampton to Manchester United)

£30m - Alexis Sanchez (Barcelona to Arsenal)

Free - Robert Lewandowski (Borussia Dortmund to Bayern Munich)

Congratulations are indeed in order. Bayern had spent the best part of three years trying to prise Lewandowski away from Borussia Dortmund, and in the end they played their hand expertly. It could prove to be one of the greatest bargains in Bayern's history.

At 25, Lewandowski arrives in Munich with his prime years right in front of him.

More importantly, though, Lewandowski is Guardiola's man. The Catalan's attitude to the striker is in stark contrast to his relationship with the Lewandowski's predecessor, Mario Mandzukic.

As many players have found to their chagrin over the years, a clash of egos with Guardiola can see anyone frozen out of a team.

Mandzukic fell out of favour last season, with the player not even travelling to Berlin to celebrate Bayern winning the Double.

The Croatian's style of play was also less suited to Guardiola's philosophy. A surprising amount of Bayern's goals last season came from crosses, set pieces and headers.

At times, they looked muted when trying to pass through the gaps of their opposition. Lewandowski will add a dynamism to that forward play which Mandzukic lacked.

Lewandowski, it would seem, is one of the last, crucial pieces in the Guardiola's jigsaw.
