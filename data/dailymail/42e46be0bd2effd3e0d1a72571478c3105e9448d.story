Lawsuit: Joe Rogers Jr. is suing his former housekeeper over claims she secretly recorded a sex tape of the two together and tried to extort him over it

The married CEO of the Waffle House restaurant chain who claims his former assistant tried to extort him with a sex tape of them together appeared in court in Atlanta on Wednesday.

Joe Rogers Jr. is suing Mye Brindle and her three attorney's claiming that his ex-housekeeper tried to blackmail him to settle her own sexual harassment claims.

The legal battle is being fought over a video of a sex-act between Rogers and Brindle which the fast-food chief claims was recorded without his knowledge and set-up by his assistant at the instruction of her legal team.

A Cobb Country Superior Court judge heard the lawsuit, which was filed on May 30 in which Rogers accuses attorneys David Cohen, Hylton Dupree and John Butters of colluding with Mye Brindle to obtain evidence illegally.

'As part of their scheme, Defendants decided that a video clearly depicting the sexual encounters would enable them to force Rogers to pay exorbitant sums under the threat that they would disclose publicly the sexual encounters which had occurred between Brindle and Rogers,' the lawsuit states according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution.

The lawsuit alleges that Brindle, who served as Rogers' assistant and housekeeper from May 2003 to June 2012 did have 'infrequent consensual sexual encounters' with him.

However, he completely denies any sexual harassment and claims that Brindle launched her sexual suit to extort money from him.

Waffle House has over 2,100 locations across the United States, predominantly in the South and was founded by Rogers.

The family is estimated to be worth upwards of $400 million.

All three attorneys named in the suit and Brindle deny the claims that Rogers has made.

'Mr. Rogers’ baseless allegations are an act of desperation,' Dupree told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

'We will respond in court at the appropriate time.'

Accusations: Rogers' housekeeper, who cannot be identified, worked for the businessman for almost a decade before handing in her notice in June of 2012

Last year a  judge took custody of the DVDs recorded in secret, which included a video and about 15 audio recordings, and viewed them in a closed court hearing.

During those proceedings, Cobb County Court Judge Robert Leonard II ruled that the housekeeper was a willing participant in the sexual encounter and was not a 'victim of sexual battery'.

Leonard II wrote in the order: 'The defendant's arguments that she was a victim of the crime of sexual battery and was permitted to record plaintiff's actions to gather evidence of a crime is extremely unpersuasive to the court.

'The video recording makes it clear that defendant was a willing participant in the sexual encounter and is not the victim of sexual battery.'

Also last year, details of how the woman recorded the sexual encounter were revealed, ABC reported.

The court document states that the woman's attorneys met with her in a private investigator's office where she was ordered a 'spy camera' disguised as a cellphone.

The lawsuit stems from accusations made by Rogers' former employee, who cannot be identified, who says she was forced into sex.

The former employee filed a police report saying Rogers demanded she perform sexual acts to keep her job.

Rogers said they had a consensual sexual relationship and that the woman is attempting extortion.

Claims: The 43-year-old housekeeper told Atlanta police in 2012 that the Waffle House CEO demanded she perform sexual acts in exchange for keeping her job

The 43-year-old woman told Atlanta police in September 2012 that Rogers demanded she perform sexual acts in exchange for keeping her job and that he also tried to force her to have sex with him despite her repeated protests.

She said that he touched her breasts, tried to remove her clothes, made lewd comments, appeared naked before her and insisted she perform sex acts on him at least once or twice a month.

She said this occurred for nearly a decade, from 2003 through June of 2012 until she handed in her resignation.

Rogers said she is not telling the truth.

He released a statement at the time saying: 'Over an almost eight-year period when I was separated, single and re-married, I had a series of infrequent, consensual sexual encounters with my housekeeper.'

He said the woman worked for 15 hours a week from 2003 until she was let go in 2008. He said she later was rehired as his house manager and quit her job in June

'Shortly thereafter, on July 16, 2012, I received a letter from her attorney containing false allegations and strong threats,' Rogers said. 'According to her attorneys, she now wants millions of dollars from me.'

Rogers said he shared the letter from the woman's attorney with his wife and they hired lawyers to look into the situation. Rogers and the woman sued each other, but documents in those cases were sealed.

Rogers' attorney, Robert Ingram, said a Cobb County judge lifted a gag order in Rogers' lawsuit Tuesday 'so Joe could get his version of the story out'.

'They were tapes that [she] recorded, which is a crime in the state of Georgia to record somebody when that person had an expectation of privacy and doesn't consent to the recording,' Ingram said.

David Cohen, the woman's attorney, said: 'We understand he's obviously trying to spin his wrongful actions in some positive light.

'We believe attempting to attack the victim will only make matters worse and that the parties just need to let a jury decide the issues. Our position and facts as they have evolved thus far are stated in our verified counterclaim filed in the courthouse, which is part of the record unsealed by the court today.'

In the police report, the woman identified herself as a single mother. She said she stayed in the job and submitted to Rogers because she couldn't find other employment with comparable pay.

She said she gave Rogers a letter of resignation in June after her son secured a full college scholarship.

Rogers said he was wrong to have sex with the woman during a period when he was separated and later remarried.

'That was wrong of me and I am very sorry for the pain and embarrassment I've caused my wife and family. There is no excuse for what I have done,' he said.

He added, 'As personally embarrassing as this situation is for me, I am committed to the legal and law enforcement process to expose the motives of my former housekeeper and her attorneys.'

Rogers' opened his first waffle house in Atlanta in 1955, growing the company into a major chain of  restaurants throughout the South.
