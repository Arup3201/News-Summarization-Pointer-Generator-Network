This is the incredible moment a fearless mother bravely wrestled with a carjacker who tried to steal her Audi when she left the engine running for a few seconds.

Deborah Fielding had left the car to open the barrier at her work in Oldham, Greater Manchester, when the would-be thief jumped in the driver's seat and tried to make off.

But when she saw the thief reversing away in her car, the 52-year-old instantly raced over and began grappling with the man, refusing to let him leave.

Deborah Fielding had left her vehicle for just a few seconds when the would-be thief jumped in the driver's seat and began reversing off - but she wasted no time racing to fight him off, despite tripping over 

When Mrs Fielding sees the man attempt to drive away, she throws herself towards the car and tries to prise open the door

The man keeps trying to reverse, but Mrs Fielding clings onto the driver's door and begins wrestling with him

In the extraordinary footage, which was captured on CCTV, Mrs Fielding is even seen tripping over as she races towards the vehicle to fight off the man.

But, determined to reach him, she immediately gets up and throws herself towards the car, where she begins prising open the door.

Brave: Deborah Fielding refused to give up 

As the man tries to reverse, Mrs Fielding is seen clinging onto the door, as it slams open and shut against her.

Despite the man fighting back, the determined mother is seen wrestling with him as she hangs half in and half out of the car.

At one point, the man reverses so forcefully that Mrs Fielding is almost dragged under the front wheels. 

But Mrs Fielding soon regains her footage and carries on clinging to the vehicle as drives back and forth several times.

The astonishing grapple continues for at least 30 seconds before the man eventually leaves the car and runs away from the scene.  

Today her daughter Louise Fielding said: 'She's a little warrior.

'She's bruised all over but she wouldn't let go. she was saying "It's my car, you can't have it".

'Her passport was in her bag on the back seat because she was going on holiday this afternoon so she was determined not to let him get away with it.' 

The clip was taken from security CCTV at Rhinos Gym, which is near to Green Care Pest Control, where the incident took place.

Miss Fielding, who works for the pest control company where her mother is managing director, said her mum was left 'badly bruised' and 'shaken' by the incident.

She said: 'Mum had gone into the office a little early because she was going on holiday to Tenerife later today and wanted to get some work done.

'I don't know whether the guy was watching the entrance to the car park or was an opportunist, but he took advantage when she got out of the car to open the barrier to leap in.

'She told me she saw him and the adrenaline kicked in, she would not let the car go, she was like, "That's my car, you're not having it" especially as it had her passports in her handbag on the back seat.

Mrs Fielding is seen clinging on to the door, wrestling with him as she is half in and half out of the car.

At one point, the brave woman loses her footing and is almost dragged under the wheels of the car as the man reverses

But she refuses to let go, clinging on right until the man has reversed into the nearby road 

'She refused to let go even though at one point she almost went under the car.

'This is not something she would normally, do, she is a little warrior, I'm so proud of her, though she was stupid to risk being hurt.'

Miss Fielding, who arrived at work an hour later to find her mother being interviewed by police, said: 'I was so shocked when I came into work and heard what happened.

'My mum is bruised all over her body and in a lot of pain. She didn't want to go on holiday, and I think she will be in too much pain to enjoy it much.' 

She carries on as the man drives forwards again but - after a 30-second grapple - the carjacker eventually gives up and jumps out of the driver's seat

He then flees from the scene, leaving Mrs Fielding shocked and bruised - but with her car in tact 

Miss Fielding said police were now trying to trace the thief. She begged anyone who might have seen anything to come forward.

She said: 'There were lots of people waiting in their cars who saw the whole incident, although none of them bothered to get out of their cars to help or even called the police. If they had done, maybe he would have been caught in the act.

'My mother did not see his face, which he was trying to cover, and he didn't speak. He was wearing gloves so there's no fingerprints. But maybe someone recognises his clothes or the way he ran.

'He was an aggressive thief, he hurt her and I hope he's caught.'
