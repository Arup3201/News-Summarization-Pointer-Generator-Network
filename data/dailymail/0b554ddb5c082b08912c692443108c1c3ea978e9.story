A 24-year-old single mother in Mt Clemens, Michigan has become America's newest millionaire after turning in her winning $66million lottery ticket.

On Thursday, Kelsey Zachow spoke about her win at a press conference, and later posed with her check and 7-month-old baby boy Benjamin.

At the press conference, Zachow talked about how she plans to spend her winnings and how she went more than a week without knowing about the valuable Mega Millions lottery ticket tucked in her purse.

Payday: Zachow bought her winning ticket on the way to work on Friday the 13th, but didn't know she won until 11 days later

Zachow says she has been buying lottery tickets two times a week for the past five years, spending an estimated $10,000 on tickets.

So as part of her usual habit, she stopped by the Sonny's Market in Mt Clemens on her way to work on June 13 and picked up four tickets with her regular numbers, and one easy pick. .

'Friday the 13th has always been a really lucky day for me,' she said. 'I went home that night and I’m like nothing really good happened. (I thought) that’s weird.'

It wasn't until 11 days later, on June 24, that she realized she won.

She stopped back at the market and checked her numbers at the stand, but she was prompted to take the tickets to the teller.

The cashier then broke the news that Zachow 'won big'.

She couldn't believe it, so she ran back to her car, locked the door and checked her numbers on the phone.

'I couldn't breathe,' she said.

When she realized that she indeed had the winning ticket, won with the easy pick numbers, she rushed home to tell her boyfriend of the three years, Billy Bartlett.

He says she came speeding home at 100mph and kept screaming though he didn't know what the news was about.

When he double checked her tickets, Bartlett says his jaw 'dropped to the floor'.

Since it was a Sunday, Zachow couldn't turn her ticket in until the next day, so she kept it in a relatives safe for security.

Then, after consulting with a lawyer and financial consultant, she went to the Michigan Lottery office to claim her winnings.

Zachow has decided to accept her jackpot in a lump sum, which amounts to about $27million after taxes.

'I wanted to be smart with it. I’ve been playing for five years so I kinda had a plan if I ever did win,” she said. “You watch those (TV) shows. People go bankrupt and lose it all. So, financial adviser, lawyer, taxes -- just getting everything straight beforehand. We have our ducks in a row and now we can have fun.'

She has since quit her two jobs as a bartender and medical assistant, which she previously worked to support her son and also her boyfriend and his 5-year-old daughter Evelyn. 

Spender: Zachow plans to spend her money on a new house and college tuition for some of her younger family members, including her 7-month-old son

Barlett, has been laid off from his job in construction for about a year.

Zachow says she first plans to spend her money buying a new SUV, perhaps a Jeep, and then a electric blue Mustang GTR convertible with dual exhaust and leather seats.

She also wants to but the house of her dreams in the St. Clair area. Some place with acreage where she might one day be able to open a no-kill animal shelter.

From there, she plans to treat herself to vacations in Europe, the Caribbean and Ireland - where most of her boyfriend's family are from.

The money will also go to pay the college tuition for her son, boyfriend's daughter, and her 2-year-old little brother Gus Schmidlin.

Zachow's winnings were the largest ever won by a Michigan lottery player on a Friday the 13th.
