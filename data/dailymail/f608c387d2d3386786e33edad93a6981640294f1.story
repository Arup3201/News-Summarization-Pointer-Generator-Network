Mexico officials are offering Sony Pictures Entertainment and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. up to $20 million to portray a positive image of the country in the upcoming 'James Bond' film, 'Spectre.'

Among many private documents leaked by hackers in the recent Sony hack were emails between Sony and MGM officials regarding the upcoming 'James Bond' film, looking for ways to save money, according to Tax Analysts. 

As part of, what the e-mails referred to as, the 'Mexican Deal,' producers are making several changes to the film to secure up to $20 million from Mexican officials including script rewrites and casting changes.

In one email, Jonathan Glickman, president of MGM's motion picture group, wrote that producers are facing a budget for 'Spectre' far beyond what was expected. 

Now more than $300 million, Glickman said producers are under 'immense' pressure to reduce the film's budget to $250 million.  

'This is not about 'nickel and diming' the production,' Glickman wrote. 'As of now, our shooting period is $50M higher than 'Skyfall' and the current gross budget sits in the mid $300Ms, making this one of the most expensive films ever made.'

Desperate to save money, producers have reportedly given up a measure of creative control. 

They are so desperate in fact, that the studio allowed Mexican officials to dictate characters' ethnicities, make casting decisions, and change the occupation of an unnamed character that never appears on screen, the Independent reports.

Changes: Mexico officials requested that the villain in the film be an international ambassador rather than a Mexico City mayor and that Mexican police be depicted as a 'special force'

Among the changes, Mexico officials requested that the villain in the film be an international ambassador rather than a Mexico City mayor, that Mexican police  be depicted as a 'special force,' and that a Mexican actress be cast as a Bond Girl.

As was recently announced, Mexican actress Stephanie Sigman has joined the cast of 'Spectre' as Estrella. 

The film received $14 million for roughly four minutes of footage in the film's opening, Business Insider reports. 

Mexico officials would reportedly give another $6 million to the film if producers highlighted the skyline and 'modern' features of Mexico City -- the film's first shooting location. 

Amy Pascal, then chair of Sony's motion picture group, encouraged Glickman to move forward with the changes to increase the project's eligibility for Mexico's film production incentive programs.

'We should insist they add whatever travelogue footage we need in Mexico to get the extra money,' Pascal reportedly said in an e-mail.

Insider reports that Mexico officials' involvement in the film is an effort to repair the country's image amid a drug war that has claimed more than 100,000 lives since 2006.

Mexican director Guillermo del Toro spoke at a film fest recently saying that the drug war has left the country in 'social decay.' 

However, Ioan Grillo, author and expert on Mexico’s drug war, told Insider that the country's appeal through the Bond film won't help significantly and he is not surprised by the country's effort to attract tourists and investments through the film.

'It might help to improve Mexico’s image a little, but if the government really wants a better image, it needs to change the reality and stop mass disappearances and massacres,' Grillo said.
