Not content with the tight security in place at many of the nations airports, the TSA is now funding the roll-out of exit pods at major airport terminals across the country.

The pods temporarily detain passengers before they are allowed to leave.

Travelers are forced through the pods as the leave the airport terminal before a robotic voice gives instructions to wait inside the pod until a green light is shown and the door opens.

Beam me up! These new exit 'pods' have been put in place for passengers to pass through as they leave the baggage claim at Syracuse airport

Detention: Passengers enter the pods and have to wait for a green light before they can be released

Savings: The introduction of pods mean that there is no need for the presence of TSA security guards or police any longer and will save the government agency money

Once travelers exit the pods, they are unable to re-enter the terminal.

The pods have already been installed at Syracuse International Airport as part of a $60 million dollar renovation.

There are plans for the pods to be installed at other major airports soon.

'We need to be vigilant and maintain high security protocol at all times. These portals were designed and approved by TSA which is important,' said Syracuse Airport Commissioner Christina Callahan. to CNY Central News.

Narrow: Sometimes the pods close on passengers who are wheeling through luggage

The pods allow for a reduction in police or security guards to be stationed at the airport. Usually, there would be a person standing at the exit.

The move to introduce the glass exit pods may ultimately delay passengers' exits from the airport but it will also save the TSA money.

Critics: Some bloggers have declared the pods to be 'detention' pods
