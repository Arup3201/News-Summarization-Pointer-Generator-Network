A 27-year-old woman who allegedly bit her boyfriend's penis through his pants during an argument yesterday morning has been charged.

Georgia's Sade Rene Greene is accused of scratching her live-in lover's face and neck and chomping on his manhood at their Magnolia Terrace, Athens, home about 12.45am.

The woman's father, 52-year-old Ricky Levell Greene, has also been charged after allegedly punching the victim in the mouth.

Athens Banner-Herald reported Athens-Clarke
County police found the unidentified victim shirtless in the 
street after he called for help.

Police said he was covered in scratches and bleeding from a split lower lip.

Ricky Greene told officers his daughter and the victim had been arguing earlier in the day at the residence where the trio live.

The dad then left with a friend after telling the fueding couple to cut it out.

Ricky claimed that when he returned home highly intoxicated, his daughter told him her boyfriend had pulled her by the hair and pushed her onto a bed.

Ricky also told police the victim threatened him with a gun before Sade tried to get between them - a claim Sade denied.

Ricky said the victim fled after he told him 'if he was going to point a gun on him that he needed to pull the trigger'.

Sade told police a gun wasn't involved.

It is not clear what triggered the fight.

The Greenes have been charged with battery and were released from the Clarke County Jail after posting $1,500 bond.
