Mike Tyson swore at a television presenter live on air after he brought up his conviction for rape.

The former  world heavyweight champion had been expressing his support for Toronto mayor Rob Ford when the presenter suggested that Tyson's 1992 conviction may actually harm Ford's bid for re-election.

After initially saying he had 'no comment' to make, the 48-year-old said to CP24 news anchor Nathan Downer: 'You're being negative. I met the mayor and there's nothing they can do about it.'

Tyson was jailed in the 1990s for raping 18-year-old beauty queen Desiree Washington in an Indianapolis hotel room which he has always denied.

He received 10 years for each charge on which he was convicted - one count of rape and two of criminal deviate conduct. After suspending four years from each, the judge ordered the sentences to run concurrently and he served three years of a six-year sentence.

In the interview Tyson said to his interviewer: 'You come across like a nice guy but you're really a piece of s***. F*** you, that (question) was a piece of s***.'

Downer then puts up his hands and says 'Hey, come on. We're doing live TV now.' 

In a tweet after the incident, Downer told his followers he was 'not taking it personally'

Tyson responds: 'I don't care. What are you going to do about it?'

Downer then asks Tyson about his one-man show 'Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth.' Tyson appeared on CP24 with the Canadian promoter of the show. 

Tyson tells Downer the show it 'speaks for itself' before the promoter talks about it. 

When asked about whether he found acting or boxing more nerve racking, Tyson responded: 'It's more nerve-wracking talking to a rat piece of s*** like you.' 

 'Come on, Mike,' Downer responds.

Tyson insults him again before Downer wraps up the interview and thanks Tyson for coming as Tyson swears at him.

In a tweet after the incident, Downer said it was unfortunate his question hurt Tyson's feelings and that it wasn't his intention.

'I'm okay everybody,' Downer tweeted.

Downer apologized for the language and followed that up with another tweet.

'No ill will toward Mike Tyson. He lashed out at me and that's okay. Not taking it personally.'

In his turbulent life Tyson has been married three times, fathered eight children and became the youngest heavyweight champion the world has ever seen at just 20. 

But fame ruined him and his troubled upbringing - his mother was a prostitute and he never knew his pimp father - came back to haunt him.

He used to keep a white Bengal Tiger named Kenya in his backyard. It cost him around £2,000 a month just to care for him, and the story goes that one day Kenya got loose and caused quite a commotion in Southington, Ohio.

He was also in the grip of numerous addictions; to sex, often with strippers and prostitutes, even though he was married with children; and to spending on an improbable scale.

He spent around £200million, much of it on gifts to people he barely knew, on cars he never drove, and on bad business deals which he barely troubled to understand.

He was also addicted to alcohol and drugs, having a long dependence on marijuana and a fondness for cocaine and Hennessy brandy.

Three years ago, he was jailed for driving under the influence of cocaine and was found with three bags of the drug in his car.

At times, he has used prescription drugs like Zoloft for depression, too. 'I'm on the Zoloft to keep me from killing y'all,' he once announced at a press conference. 

After years of controversial headlines, at the age of 39, Tyson retired in 2005 – but he admits he’s ‘the same guy – I just grew up a little bit’.

He has spent his recent years trying to reconnect with his six children by four different mothers.
