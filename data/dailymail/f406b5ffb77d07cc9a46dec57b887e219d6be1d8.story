The votes are in and this year's top jokes from the Edinburgh Fringe comedy festival have been decided upon. But one thing is noticeable by its absence: women.

Despite shows from hundreds of exceptionally talented female comedians in Scotland over August - including Janeane Garofalo, Gemma Whelan, Sarah Millican, Sandi Toksvig, Lucy Porter, Caroline Rhea and Bridget Christie - not one woman made Dave's Funniest Joke list, so named thanks to sponsorship from the channel Dave.

Dave's top joke list was startling in its absence of female performers, including Sandi Toksvig, left, and American actress and comedian Janeane Garofalo, right

The honour of top spot went to 30-year-old Rob Auton, a former paintbrush salesman from York, who won 24 per cent of the votes with his gag: 'I heard a rumour that Cadbury is bringing out an oriental chocolate bar. Could be a Chinese Wispa.'

(One, Lou Sanders, appeared in last year's top 10, two in 2011. The Guardian's comedy editor Brian Logan said: 'The omission is particularly galling, because most of the funniest and most creative shows at this year's fringe are by female comics.'

He added that there is a certain 'male-pattern nerdiness' to the kind of punning wordplay that wins on a list like this, while 'most of the best jokes - from men as well as women - aren't reproducible out of context.'

Tim Vine's joke about Italy made the list, but Lucy Porter, right, was another woman who did not

It was sole-destroying.'3. Alfie Moore - 'I'm in a same-sex marriage... the sex is always the same.'4. Tim Vine - 'My friend told me he was going to a fancy dress party as an Italian island. I said to him "Don't be Sicily".'5. Gary Delaney - 'I can give you the cause of anaphylactic shock in a nutshell.'6. Phil Wang - 'The Pope is a lot like Doctor Who. He never dies, just keeps being replaced by white men.'7. Marcus Brigstocke - 'You know you are fat when you hug a child and it gets lost.'8. Liam Williams - 'The universe implodes. No matter.'9. Bobby Mair - 'I was adopted at birth and have never met my mum. That makes it very difficult to enjoy any lapdance.'10. Chris Coltrane - 'The good thing about lending someone your time machine is that you basically get it back immediately.'
