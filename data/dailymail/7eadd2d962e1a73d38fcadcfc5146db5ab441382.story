A 12-year-old boy who died after a 
schoolyard attack was punched two or three times in the face and refused
 to fight back, investigators confirmed yesterday.

An initial investigation into the 
tragic death of Bailey O'Neill, from Darby Township, Pennsylvania, has 
confirmed claims by his parents that he was the innocent victim of 
bullies and an honors student who wanted to avoid trouble.

Bailey suffered a concussion, broken 
nose and other injuries on January 10 at Darby Township School when two boys jumped him in recess - with one pushing him and the 
other landing the blows.

Days later he started suffering violent seizures causing doctors to put him in a medical coma. 

He had a long battle in hospital but sadly died on Sunday - just a day after his 12th birthday.

Since the incident his father, Rob 
O'Neill, has started an anti- bullying campaign which has been backed by
 Baltimore Ravens player Ray Rice.

His mother Jini Risoldi has spoken about 
how the brief altercation destroyed his health and ultimately claimed 
the life of her child.

'He was a perfectly healthy boy before January 10,' she told NBC.

'He was an honor roll student. He was 
smart. He was loving. I asked him why he did not fight back and he said 
he didn’t want to get in trouble,' she added

'No more phone calls, no more hanging out, no one to say daddy - it's the worst thing,' Rob O'Neill told ABC News.

'He didn't want to fight that day. He 
wanted to walk away. And that's it. He wanted to walk away. It shouldn't
 have ever happened. I'm at peace at the fact he doesn't have the pain 
anymore - I feel he's safe now, he doesn't have to suffer anymore.'

Fan: Bailey, who lived in a suburb of Philadelphia, was a keen sportsman

'I don't ever want another kid to end up like Bailey,' he added to WPTV. 

Witnesses at the school had previously reported that Bailey wanted to avoid the fight.

But investigators say there is no evidence so far
 that the sixth-grader had been builled by the boys in the run up to the
 attack. 

They believe it could have been a one off incident. 

They say the next stage of their 
inquiries will further examine the relationships between the boys and to
 decide whether Bailey's seizures were directed related to the injuries 
he sustained in the fight.

That will decide whether the boys 
involved face charges ranging from harassment and simple assault to 
involuntary manslaughter. 

'We're having trouble showing there was 
bullying, as a course of conduct as we define it, intimidation or 
harassment between these two boys over a course of time,' Delaware 
County District Attorney Jack Whelan said.

'We have not been able to 
establish that.'

'The question is, what degree of charge 
are we filing? Are we going to be able to establish the seizure disorder
 that caused his death is directly related to the punches thrown in the 
school yard that particular day?'

Bailey's parents say the fight was the 
cause of his illness. They took him to the emergency room days after the incident saying he seemed different 
and not himself in the days after the concussion before the seizures began.

The boys involved also aged 11 have not been identified.

The father of the boy who threw the 
punches has expressed his sadness for the Bailey family but denied the categorization of his son as a bully.

'I feel sorry you know,' he told NBC10. 
'I don’t know the family, but no one wants death on anybody. I feel 
sorry for the young man and I feel sorry for my son because my son’s 
depicted as a bully.'

He added that his son was 'not the monster everybody is trying to make him out to be'.

The two boys were suspended from the school for two days while Bailey was given an ice pack and sent back to class.

The Roman Catholic teenager was due to be confirmed on March 18. 

A tribute from his family said he loved 
sports and his family - he has two step siblings, brother Joshua Risoldi
 and sister Allyson Risoldi.

'Bailey loved being with his family, he 
enjoyed playing and watching sports with his Dad. Bailey also loved 
spending time at the beach and on other family outings. Bailey touched 
so many lives and was loved by many friends and family. He enjoyed 
riding his skate board, scooter, playing video games, baseball with 
Briarcliffe A.A. and football with his friends.'

His funeral will take place at St. Joseph Church, Woodlawn Ave on Saturday. 

The Philadelphia Medical Examiner's Office is expected to rule on the cause of his death later this month.

Southeast Delco School District 
Superintendent Stephen Butz said the school is cooperating with the investigation.

'We
 take bullying seriously,' he said.  'We are very concerned about the 
medical condition of the student and our thoughts and prayers are with 
the family and students.'
