They say money can't buy you happiness. But it certainly get you a yacht on which to take your mind off any worries.

Billionaire businessman James Packer has been pictured soaking up the sun on a luxury vessel with friends Lachlan and Sarah Murdoch during a break in Greece - just days after it emerged he had split from his model wife Erica Baxter, 36.

The tycoon, 46 - ranked one of the richest people on earth - was clearly enjoying the distraction from personal issues at home as he climbed aboard a speedboat headed to an giant yacht moored off shore.

Son of Rupert Murdoch, Lachlan and his wife, Australia's Next Top Model presenter, Sarah, entertained Mr Packer and a host of other guests on a luxury boat on Sunday evening.

The
son of the late media mogul Kerry Packer - a fierce 
opponent of Rupert Murdoch - is rated 198th on the Forbes magazine list 
of the world's richest people following his investments in casinos in 
Asia and Australia.

Miss
Baxter, 36, mother of Mr Packer's three children, has moved out of 
their £30million home - completed just eight weeks ago - on the shores 
of Sydney harbour and has travelled to Los Angeles with children Indigo,
five, Jackson, three and Emmanuelle, who will be one later this month.

Announcing the split, a statement issued to Sydney's Daily Telegraph said simply: 'It is with great sadness that Erica and James Packer announce their separation.

'We remain deeply close friends and incredibly proud parents and our children are our priority going forward.'

A source told Fairfax Media that there were no third parties involved.

The source said: 'Erica and the kids are in LA and James is planning to spend a lot of his time there over the next few months.

'They're friends and they want to make sure they will stay friends. The kids are their priority. It's that simple.

'Any separation is traumatic but because this will attract so much publicity, they're determined to do their best to shield the kids and look after them, first and foremost.'

While Sydney's Daily Telegraph referred to the couple as having already divorced, Fairfax said they had separated.

But friends agreed that the split was permanent, even though the couple say they will remain friends.

The announcement comes two months 
after Mr Packer, who has an estimated personal fortune of £4billion, won
a government licence to build a £1billion casino-resort beside Sydney 
harbour.

Celebrity-watchers had first spotted 
Miss Baxter in Los Angeles without Mr Packer in July and a few days 
later she flew alone to Paris.

The couple married in a multi-million
pound ceremony in the South of France in 2007, with Tom Cruise and his 
then-wife Katie Holmes in attendance along with a number of high profile
people, including Rupert Murdoch.

Miss Baxter had once had a relationship with Mr Packer's friend, British casino heir Damian Aspinall.

Mr Packer has had colourful relationships, having dated a number of models while in his 20s.
