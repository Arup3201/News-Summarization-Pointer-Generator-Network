More than 200 surfers dressed as Santa Claus, elves and snowmen were surfing the Christmas Eve waves off central Florida's Atlantic coast.

Cocoa Beach Mayor Dave Netterstrom took in the view from the sand on Tuesday, declaring the fourth-annual gathering 'the largest surfing Santa event on the planet'.

Organizer George Trosset says he may move the holiday event to downtown Cocoa Beach next year to accommodate growing crowds.

The brave surfers crashed into the Atlantic's three to four foot waves under gray skies and rain.

Mr Trosset started the tradition in 2009 with a few family members after seeing a TV commercial featuring people surfing in Santa Claus attire.

More friends joined them the following year, and in 2012, nearly 160 surfers participated.

Mr Trosset says the event 'has gone from being a little family party to being a community event'.

Donations at the event raised $4,000 for Grind for Life, a non-profit that helps cancer patients with travel costs to treatment centers.

Matt Scales, 18, dressed in red board shorts, suspenders and Santa cap, told Florida Today: 'They’re a little choppy today, but they’re pretty solid for Cocoa Beach.

'It’s pretty cool. It’s kind of crazy seeing so many people dressed up in the water.'
