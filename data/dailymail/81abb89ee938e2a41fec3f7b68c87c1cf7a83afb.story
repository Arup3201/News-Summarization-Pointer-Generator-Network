Owen Farrell and Sam Warburton are among the stars who feature in a new inspirational advertisement for Dove. 

Farrell and Warburton, who are joined by Ireland's Cian Healy and Greig Laidlaw of Scotland, recite an adapted version of Rudyard Kipling's poem 'If'.

The rugby stars go through their pre-match preparations - including their journey to the stadium - before entering the tunnel while gearing themselves up for an upcoming match.

'If you can bear out your enemy when the battle has lost,' recites Farrell. 'Then you will know the taste of real victory.'

'If you can belt out a national anthem and be proud to shed a tear,' says Healy.

The advertisement comes to an end when Saracens star Farrell links hand with a mascot before reciting the rest of the 1895 poem.
