This week’s heavy rain has not put an end to the drought gripping swathes of the country, the Environment Agency said today.

While the April showers across England and Wales will have been welcomed by farmers and gardeners, who were hit with a hosepipe ban earlier this month, the rain has to make the soil fully wet before it can start to recharge supplies.

The worst of the drought has been centred in the south of the country - but further north, residents in York faced a wet walk to work as the River Ouse burst its banks this morning.

Call this a drought? A damp commute to work along York's River Ouse, which has bursts its banks in the centre of the city, after days of torrential rain and more heavy showers forecast over the weekend

In the capital, meanwhile, stormy conditions last night caused chaos after a rush hour lightning strike saw many trains cancelled.

Services in and out of Victoria station were the worst affected after the strike at south Wandsworth, near the central London transport hub, caused a fire that badly damaged a substation, leading to a power failure and serious signalling problems.

All Southeastern services were suspended last night and some services into London saw minor delays this morning.

The wet weather in the past week means that the North East and Anglian regions have already had more than 90 per cent of the average annual rainfall for April, while the South East has had 60 per cent of the rain it would normally expect for the month.

The Met Office predicts virtually the whole of the UK will get rain this weekend, setting the scene for a soggy London Marathon on Sunday.

Runners have been told the race will start amid sunny intervals, but they can expect to be drenched in the afternoon.

Even still, groundwater levels are similar to what they were last week, and many river levels remain below normal.

There are reports the River Wylye in Wiltshire and a brook at Pixley, in Herefordshire, are drying up.

In its latest update on the drought, the Environment Agency said rainfall was only likely to replenish groundwater supplies if there were large amounts of steady rain in the next month or two - the chances of which were 'very slim'.

As the UK moves into summer, most rainfall is taken up by growing plants.

More areas slid into drought this week, with 17 counties in the Midlands and South West now officially in a state of drought, and the Environment Agency warned the situation could last until Christmas or beyond.

And heavy rain could lead to flash 
flooding, as dry soils do not absorb the water easily, so it runs off 
and causes floods, the agency has warned.

Polly
Chancellor, national drought co-ordinator for the Environment Agency, 
said: 'While we’ve had some welcome rain this week, the environmental 
drought affecting large parts of England could last until Christmas.

'The
soil is so dry that only steady rain over the winter will restore 
rivers and groundwaters, so we would urge everyone - right across the 
country - to help by using less water.'

She
added: 'We are working with businesses, farmers and water companies to 
plan ahead to meet the challenges of a continued drought.'

Umbrellas out: Anyone planning break in the UK this weekend should take note as virtually the entire country will get rain. This prediction from the Met Office shows rain and cloud in blue and red at 1pm on Saturday

Wet weekend: The Met Office predicts the downpour will carry on late into Saturday afternoon, with rain still falling by 4pm
