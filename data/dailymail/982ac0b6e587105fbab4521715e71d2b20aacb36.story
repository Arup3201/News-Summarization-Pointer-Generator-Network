A man who hit a badger at 50mph was shocked when it was prised out of his car's radiator grille and scurried back into the forest.

Borgar Kristensen, 50, stopped on the E18 in Telemark, Norway, when he found the animal curled up inside the front of his Peugeot.

But when he and three colleagues unwedged what they thought was the dead animal with a stick, instead of collapsing into the road it ran off almost unharmed.

Furry lucky: This badger survived being hit by a Peugeot at 50mph in Norway and scurried off almost unharmed

He told MailOnline: I drove maybe half a kilometre and stopped and it was still there. I was amazed it was still alive.'

Mr Kristensen, from the southern city of Porsgrunn, was inspired to reveal the photo after a British Peugeot driver arrived home to find a baby deer in her radiator grille.

The unnamed woman hit the Muntjac deer as she drove through Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, and found it embedded in the front of her Peugeot 207 after driving for two miles.

She called the RSPCA and firefighters dismantled the front of her car to free the deer, which survived.

Mr Kristensen, who had the photo on 
his phone for a year before revealing it, was unable to avoid the badger
 because there was a car coming the other way when he spotted it.

He told The Local: 'After four or five minutes, the animal went down the road. It was not badly injured.'

To Norwegian newspaper VG, he said: 'When we started to poke away at it, revived it.

'We spent some time trying to get it loose, and it remained for a few minutes on the tarmac before it arose.

'When it got to his feet, it staggered toward the grove. It was probably really knocked out.'
