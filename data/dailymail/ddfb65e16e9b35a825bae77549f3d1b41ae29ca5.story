For some parents it can feel like their children are never going to leave home, but spare a thought for adult giant armadillos. 

New research, using automatic camera traps, has shown at these rare and elusive scaly-skinned mammals have to put up with some extremely clingy offspring. 

Scientists had thought that young giant armadillos struck out on their own to find their own territory at six weeks old, but research shows this is closer to 17 months.

Remotely triggered camera trap pictures showed that Alex the young giant armadillo was still interacting, often in quite tender moments, with his mother more than a year after he should have become independent

The four year study of the termite-eating creatures revealed the youngsters continue sharing dens with their mothers long after they are capable of looking after themselves.

The findings suggest that giant armadillos may be nature's equivalent of human parents who suffer from so-called 'full-nest syndrome', where their adult children stay at home well into their thirties.

Dr Arnaud Desbiez, head of the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland's Giant Armadillo Project, made the discovery while studying an adult female armadillo and her baby.

Night time camera traps set up in the Pantanal tropical wetlands of Brazil captured the never seen before intimacy between the mother and her son, which scientists called Alex.

Dr Desbiez said: 'We discovered that young giant armadillos continue to interact and share dens with their mothers for much longer than previously thought.'

He added that although the youngster began exploring and foraging on its own after six months, it continued to share a burrow for at least year after that.

Giant armadillos live in burrows in wetland habitats in South America and although normally solitary, mothers seem to allow their offspring to continue living with them for at least a year after they can care for themselves

Dr Desbiez first captured pictures of the wild baby armadillo with his mother in 2012 and was able to watch as he grew up.

While spending short amounts of time away from home foraging, Alex continued to regularly interact with her and either share her burrow or stay in another close by.

It is still unclear exactly what age young armadillos finally break their ties completely from their mothers as Alex is continuing to cling to his patient mother.

Giant armadillos are 'ecosystem engineers' that help to protect other wildlife in the Brazilian wetlands from the searing tropical heat, according to previous work by Dr Arnaud Desbiez.

Using camera traps in front 70 giant armadillo burrows to take pictures of animals that came to use the burrows.

Published in the journal of Biotropica, the study found that the mounds attracted pumas, tapirs, a type of wild pig called Peccaries along with insects and amphibians.

The burrows are thought to provide shelter for the animals from the heat during the day, and cold at night, by providing a stable temperature below ground.

Dr Desbiez said: 'Think of them like wine cellars.' 

Armadillos are the largest members of the Xenarthra order of mammals that includes anteaters and sloths, part of a family that goes back at least 65 million years. 

Covered in a flexible armour that consists of up to 17  bands of horn and bone, they can grow nearly five feet in length, weigh up to 110lbs and live up to 15 years. 

They have large powerful claws for tearing into termite mounds.

However, observing these creatures in the wild is extremely difficult as they are nocturnal and spend much of their time in their burrows.

Giant armadillos are currently categorized as Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List as habitat loss and hunting has reduced their numbers. 

Dr Desbiez, a French researcher who lives in Pantanal, started studying giant armadillos in 2010, using radio trackers and camera traps in an attempt to learn about their hidden lives.

They found that gestation lasts five months instead of four and that they only give birth to one baby at a time, instead of two as had been believed.

Dr Desbiez believes the animals only give birth once every two years, meaning they invest huge amounts in raising their young. 

His findings could also have a dramatic impact on attempts to conserve the mammals, as it means their population growth rates are extremely slow. 

With such a low birth rate, they can easily go extinct in local areas, he warned.  

Dr Desbiez was able to follow a mother giant armadillo and her baby, named Alex, from the moment of birth using specially designed night vision cameras that filmed their intimate parenting behaviour

Giant armadillos are rarely seen in the wild as they are nocturnal and tend not to live closely together so most research has been carried out on captive animals that have been kept in zoos

Dr Desbiez said: 'We have made lots exciting discoveries about their ecology and behaviour and interactions with other species and how their burrows are used by other species.' 

Now he hopes his camera trap images of the giant armadillos can help to raise awareness of the secretive creatures.

The pictures he has captured have been awarded a runner up prize in the New Behaviour and Rare Species categories of the BBC Wildlife Magazine Camera-trap Photo of the Year 2014 competition.

Dr Desbiez said: 'The worldwide recognition of these rare photographs helps share the wonder and passion we feel for the mysterious giant armadillo.

'Due to its low population density, nocturnal activity and secretive nature, the giant armadillo could become locally extinct without anyone noticing.'
