Bayern Munich look set to end their activities in this summer’s transfer window, despite having only made one major signing in Robert Lewandowski on a free transfer.

Speaking in Munich on Thursday, Bayern coach Pep Guardiola declared that he is happy with his squad, and that he will not be signing any more outfield players

On Monday Bayern struggled to a 1-1 draw against third-tier German side MSV Duisberg but Robert 
Lewandowski got off the mark for Munich after netting in his 
first appearance for the club since his move from Borussia Dortmund.

The only position left to fill, 
Guardiola said, is that of third choice goalkeeper, with youngster Lukas
 Raeder having left the club.

‘We will maybe need another goalkeeper, but otherwise there’s no need for any more transfers’ said Guardiola.

After securing former Borussia Dortmund star Robert Lewandowski on a free transfer, Bayern have brought in only two players: defender Juan Bernat from Valencia, and midfielder Sebastian Rode from Eintracht Frankfurt.

While Rode is largely expected to be a squad player, Bernat looks set to take over David Alaba’s left back position, with the Austrian moving back to midfield to replace Toni Kroos.

Neither Bernat nor Rode are transfers which have been greeted with euphoria from the Bayern fans, though, especially with Kroos having left for Real Madrid.

‘I am very honoured to have been (Kroos’) coach,’ said Guardiola, ‘we did everything to keep him, but he wanted a new challenge’.

Guardiola has also described Holger Badstuber as ‘like a new signing’, with the defender returning to the first team squad after spending eighteen months side-lined by injury.

Badstuber’s return will certainly strengthen Bayern’s defence, but there are concerns in some corners of the Munich media that the squad needs a little more if Bayern are to stay on a level with their major European rivals.

With Real Madrid, Barcelona, Chelsea and others all having added new superstars to their squads, some have criticised Bayern’s inactivity.

But to Guardiola’s credit, he is sticking by the principles which brought him success at Barcelona. He told press on Thursday that he will be looking to bring through a number of younger players into Bayern’s first team this season.

‘We are working with the younger players, and getting to know them. They will play if we need them”, he said.

Bayern certainly have a wealth of young talent at their disposal. Danish starlet Pierre-Emil Hojberg impressed as a surprise member of the starting eleven during the German Cup Final in May, and has a close relationship with Guardiola.

Players such as Gianluca Gaudino and Lucas Scholl, son of former Bayern legend Mehmet Scholl, are also looking to break through from the youth system. Both appeared for the first team in this week’s pre-season friendly against MSV Duisburg.
