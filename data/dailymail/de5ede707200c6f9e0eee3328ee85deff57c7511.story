Anderson may be a million miles away from being on the same pitch as Cristiano Ronaldo, but the Manchester United castaway did at least catch up with his former team-mate this week.

Ronaldo and his Portuguese team-mates are in the city for a friendly with Argentina at Old Trafford on Tuesday night.

And Anderson, who hasn't played for the club since August, met up with the Real Madrid sensation, along with Ricardo Quaresma.

The Porto winger posted on Instagram: 'Força Portugal! Together we are a great team. Go Portugal! #RicardoQuaresma #portugal'

Anderson, a Brazil international, also played with Quaresma during his time with Porto before a big-money move to United.

The midfielder has not been included in the squad of late, having looked unfit during a Capital One Cup performance against MK Dons, a 4-0 defeat.
