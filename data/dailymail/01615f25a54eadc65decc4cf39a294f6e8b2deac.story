Up to a million people living near Heathrow suffer from aircraft noise – more than four times official estimates, research shows.

The study says residents become ‘annoyed’ by aircraft noise at a much lower level than has previously been claimed, and that policies are being based on ‘out-of-date’ information.

The Airports Commission is currently considering a proposal to add a third runway at Heathrow, using a benchmark of 57 decibels as the level at which communities suffer ‘significant annoyance’.

A new study has revealed that residents become 'annoyed' by aircraft noise at a lower level than was previously thought. The research has shown that up to one million people living near Heathrow suffer aircraft noise

London Mayor Boris Johnson, pictured at a protest calling for no third runway at Heathrow, said expanding the airport would be 'indefensible' in light of the new evidence. The Airports Commission is considering where a new runway should be built to serve London

But last night London Mayor Boris Johnson said the new evidence on noise meant expanding Heathrow was indefensible.

The report, conducted by acoustician Dr Ian Flindell from the University of Southampton, says communities start to become irritated by noise as low as 50 decibels – which would mean that around 750,000 additional people are being adversely affected.

It goes on to say that using old data would ‘considerably underestimate the extent of reported community annoyance around UK airports’. 

An Airports Commission spokesman said: ‘A noise assessment will  be needed to take forward the appraisal of proposals to improve airport capacity. 

‘We are currently consulting on the framework for the assessment and will consider this contribution.
