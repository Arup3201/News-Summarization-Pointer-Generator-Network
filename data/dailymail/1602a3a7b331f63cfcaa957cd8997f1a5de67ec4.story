State police were trying to calculate the exact weight of a too-heavy water tanker that caused the deck of a historic bridge to partially collapse in Pittsburgh.

The tanker truck owned by Bucccaneer Enterprises of Buckhannon, W.Va., partially fell through the 136-year-old Pollocks Mills Bridge in Greene County on Sunday night. 

The bridge spans Ten Mile Creek between Morgan and Jefferson townships.

The driver, identified as Jason Wayne Strawderman, 38, of Beverly, W.Va., told police he didn’t see a weight limit when his GPS led him across the bridge, which has a 4-ton weight limit.

A representative of Buccaneer told a trooper the water tank itself holds a maximum of 4,200 gallons, though a company representative does not believe the truck was filled to capacity, according to the Washington Observer-Reporter.

Too heavy: This water tanker could have weighed up to 17,500 tons. The Pollocks Mills Bridge in Greene County, Pittsburgh, can only carry 4 tons

Lucky escape: The driver managed to dump the load of fresh water the truck was carrying, potentially stopping it from crashing into the creek below

Historic: The truss bridge was built in 1878 and spans the Ten Mile Creek near Clarksville

The truck was hauling water to a natural gas drilling site owned by EQT, for whom Buccaneer is a subcontractor. The tanker holds up to 4,200 gallons — which alone would weigh more than 17 tons — though the company has said the tractor-tanker wasn’t completely full.

The truck was removed Monday.

A 65-ton tow truck and 45-ton Peterbilt Slider tow had to be used in tandem to pull the truck off the bridge, according to the Washington Observer-Reporter.

The removal required a temporary gas shut off by People’s Natural Gas Co. to a line that crossed the bridge and supplies gas to about 4,500 residents, a gas company spokesman said.

Greene County Chief Clerk Jeffrey Marshall told the Observer-Reporter that inspectors will determine whether the bridge can be repaired, and that the county will seek damages from Buccaneer Enterprises Inc. of Buckhannon, W.Va., owners of the truck, for reimbursement of repair costs. 

Damage: A gas line that runs alongside the bridge had to be turned off as a result of the incident

Steel beams were welded to the ends of the bridge Monday afternoon as a safety precaution to prevent anyone from entering it.

Mr. Strawderman, 38, of Beverly, W.Va., told the Observer-Reporter that his GPS led him to the 136-year-old bridge and he did not see any weight restriction signs for the bridge.

Mr. Strawderman said the truck, bound for the Nicoloff, EQT well site on Pollocks Mill Road, was loaded with fresh water. 

Buccaneer is a subcontractor of EQT.

It is not known how long it will take to repair the major damage done to the bridge. The driver told police his GPS system lead him to the bridge and that he did not see a weight limit
