The photographer accused of kicking Lara Bingle during a scuffle outside a New York bar on Sunday claims that the model attacked him first.

Paparazzo Sheng Li's defence lawyer Ron Kuby says the 26-year-old lashed out at his client when he tried to take her picture, according to news.com.au.

Speaking in Manhattan Criminal Court on Monday during Li's arraignment, Kuby said that Worthington then approached his client and punched him in the face four times.

'She attacked me': The photographer accused of 'kicking' Lara Bingle says model sparked scuffle and reveals that her partner Sam Worthington punched him in the face four times

'Ms. Bingle was the one that attacked him,' Kuby said.

'She claims that Mr. Li was following her for four hours and then runs up and kicks her in the shins. In what world does that make any sense?'

'He was on the job taking pictures and Ms. Bingle got upset and ran half way up the block and attacked him.

'Her large famous boyfriend ran up and punched him four times in the face and Worthington doesn’t even get charged.'

Relocation: Sam and Lara are currently staying in New York for what is thought to be a long period of time

Meanwhile, court papers state that Li allegedly tried to purposely trip the model up in an effort to get her picture.

'The defendant followed her on a public street for approximately four hours, kept getting in her way as she was walking down the street and was trying to trip her, which caused her to fear for her safety,' they state. 

The incident, which saw both Worthington and Li arrested, occurred outside the Cubbyhole bar in the West Village.

Serious: The couple have been dating since last year but there have been rumours that they married in secret earlier this year

Speaking out: Lara posted this quote from Amy Poehler on her Instagram page on Tuesday

During the scuffle, Sam was said to have referred to Bingle as his 'wife', yelling at the photographer, 'you kicked my wife.'

However, a friend of Lara's told the MailOnline on Monday: ‘He would have been speaking figuratively. They are definitely not married, as far as I know.’

Several reports earlier this year suggested that the couple had secretly married in Western Australia ahead of a romantic trip to the Maldives.

Protective: The photographer claims that Worthington punched him four times in the face

They have since been seen wearing matching rings on their wedding fingers.

Before Worthington was taken away in a police car following his arrest on Sunday it is said that the actor asked officers if they knew 'that movie Avatar?'

New York Police Department Lieutenant John Grimpel confirmed Worthington's arrest on Sunday, New York time.

He told the Daily Telegraph: 'It happened at 5.30pm this evening.

'The photographer kicked Lara and then Worthington punched him causing the photographer to have lacerations to his nose.

So in love: Sam and Lara have been virtually inseparable since they began dating last year

'He has been charged with assault. He punched the photographer.'

Worthington was later issued a desk ticket and released, while Li was charged with assault, reckless endangerment and harassment.

MailOnline have contacted both Bingle's and Worthington's spokespeople for a comment.

This is Worthington’s second run-in with a photographer - he was arrested and pepper sprayed in Atlanta in 2012, following an argument outside of a restaurant.

Several people who witnessed the attack on Sunday (New York time) took to Twitter to describe the scene.

'Pretty sure I just saw Sam Worthington getting arrested in Greenwich Village. Definitely in a cop car. Ok. #nyc #samworthington @OmiScott,' wrote @MiriamEliseMP.

Sharing the love: Lara posted this snap of the pair together on Valentine's Day

'Just saw Sam worthington and Sara (sic) bingle get in physical fight with paparazzi outside cubby hole... Cops just got here,' tweeted @harrisonjobe.

Meanwhile, @eemmmmaa wrote: 'Just saw Sam Worthington get arrested. Hashtag New York moment.'

The Cubbyhole, is a popular gay bar located in the West Village of Manhattan. 

Worthington and his Australian model girlfriend have been in New York since the beginning of Fashion Week where they attended a number of shows together.

They were photographed strolling hand-in-hand through the city on Friday looking very much in love with the pretty blonde smiling widely as she paused to gaze into her Avatar beau’s eyes.

Lara last week told social media followers that she hopes to relocate to the Big Apple permanently saying she was in NYC and 'here to stay!'

Don't you know who I am? Following his arrest, Sam was said to have asked police officers if they knew 'that movie Avatar?'

A spokesperson later confirmed to MailOnline that she is looking to spend more time there.

Last month the Cotton On Body designer told Woman's Day magazine that she wasn't happy living in Australia because she and Worthington 'don't get any peace'.

'Sydney's my home but I don't like it,' she said.

'I can't even go to the supermarket without getting papped (snapped by paparazzi). I don't like the attention.'
