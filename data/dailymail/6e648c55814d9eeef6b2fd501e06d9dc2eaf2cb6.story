At the biggest Premier League clubs, specifically at Manchester United, Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal, with Liverpool on their tails, it is expected that the average first-team wage in five years' time will be £10million per player per season, or £200,000 per week. 

And while the average 'top club' player will routinely be earning the kind of sums reserved at the moment for the best of the best in English football, it is entirely plausible that the best of the best will be on £500,000 per week or more. 

The best young players in the division - the likes of Raheem Sterling, Eden Hazard and Ross Barkley - appear among the most likely candidates to command half-a-million pounds per week in the coming seasons, a figure which equates to £26m per year.

The Premier League will continue to be shown on Sky Sports and BT Sport until 2019 in a £5.136bn deal

By 2020, the average player in the Premier League will be earning around £5m per year, or £100,000 per week - and that stunning figure will be applicable even down to many of the 'smaller' teams, which might by then include the likes of Bournemouth or Brentford. 

And this is not idle fantasy, but a prediction using hard data based on what has happened over the 23-year history of the Premier League - and what is likely to happen next in the wake of the latest staggering TV deals.

The League announced on Tuesday that they have sold the UK live rights to matches for the three season from 2016-17 to Sky and BT Sport for a combined £5.136 billion.

When the foreign rights, near-live rights, clip rights and other commercial deals are done for the same period, it is expected the Premier League will have income of almost £9 billion for that three-year period, or close to £3bn per year.

A large majority of that money will go to the clubs, and the biggest single expenditure of any club is, and will continue to be player wages.

As the accompanying table shows, the rise and rise of Premier League wages has closely tracked the rise and rise in TV income.

In the 1992-93 season the League as a whole earned £50.7m per year from TV deals, and the average first-team wage was around £120,000 per year, or £2,300 per week.

The first Premier League UK TV deal with Sky last five years, and the second one lasted four years. 

By the third deal, TV income for the division was £520m a year - a tenfold increase on the first season. And the average first-team wage was approaching £1m a year.

The numbers show us that player salaries among the elite have been rouhgly doubling every seven years up to now. 

The Premier League's current income is almost £2bn per year and the average first-team wage is £2.3m a year, and more than double that at the top clubs.

With the new money announced yesterday arriving in club coffers from the 2016-17 season, acceleration of wages is expected after that, although there will also be year on year increases until then. 

 

Arsenal's Thierry Henry and his fellow professionals earned an average of £680,000-a-year back in 2001

Premier League players earned an average of £1.6m a year  in 2009, more than £1m less than they do now

Sky Sports have invested a huge amount of money into TV rights since the Premier League's inception

In three years' time, the rights for 2019-22 will be sold. The Premier League are famously reticent to make predictions over whether they will gain even more next time, but the trend remains upwards, not least with so many overseas markets still coming to maturity.

Transfer spending has also grown significantly as TV income has grown. But it is wage packets that use the most cash each year - and they will continue to do so.
