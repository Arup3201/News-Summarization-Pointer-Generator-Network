One of Albert Einstein's stranger ideas has led to the identification of a new planet twice as heavy as Jupiter, orbiting a star some 2,000 light-years from Earth.

‘This is the first time that this 
aspect of Einstein's theory of relativity has been used to discover a 
planet,’ said Tsevi Mazeh, of Tel Aviv University.

The discovery made use of the beaming effect which occurs when light from the parent star brightens as its planet tugs closer to Earth, and dims as the planet pulls it away.

Einstein's planet, formally known as Kepler-76b, is a 'hot Jupiter' that orbits its star every 1.5 days. The planet is tidally locked to its star, always showing the same face to it, just as the Moon is tidally locked to Earth

The warping of space-time caused by this
motion forces light particles into a narrower, more focused beam that 
looks brighter than it really is.

The newfound world, nicknamed ‘Einstein’s planet’, orbits its star every 1.5 days. It is located about 2,000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus.

Formally known as Kepler-76b, the planet is tidally locked to its star, always showing the same face to it, just as the Moon is tidally locked to Earth. 

As a result, Einstein’s planet broils at a temperature of about 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit.

The team found strong evidence that the planet has extremely fast jet-stream winds that carry the heat around it.

This is the first time optical observations have shown evidence of alien jet stream winds at work.

Detection of planets via the beaming effect was predicted in 2003 by Professor Avi Loeb at Harvard University and Professor Scott Gaudi, now at Ohio State University.

Back then, the idea was met with scepticism.David Latham, a Harvard astronomer who collaborated on the discovery, originally doubted it was even possible to do.

‘I thought it was silly,’ he told Time magazine. ‘I thought the effect was so small we’d never detect it.’

The technique requires measurements of changes in brightness as small as a few parts per million, which could not be achieved a decade ago.

But since the NASA’s Kepler spacecraft went into orbit in 2009, the researchers had the extremely detailed observations necessary to put theory into practice.

The diameter of Einstein's planet is about 25 per cent larger than Jupiter and it weighs twice as much. It orbits a type F star located about 2,000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus

Alongside Einstein’s beaming effect, the team looked for signs that the star was stretched into a American football shape by gravitational tides from the orbiting planet.

The star would appear brighter when observed the football from the side, due to more visible surface area, and fainter when viewed end-on.  The third small effect was due to starlight reflected by the planet itself.

‘We have been searching for this elusive effect for more than two years, and we finally found a planet. It is amazing that already a decade ago Loeb and Gaudi foresaw this happening,’ said Mazeh.

Einstein's planet, formally known as Kepler-76b, is a ‘hot
Jupiter’ that orbits its star every 1.5 days.

The planet is tidally locked to its star, always showing the
same face to it, just as the Moon is tidally locked to Earth.

As a result, Kepler-76b broils at a temperature of about
3,600 degrees Fahrenheit.

Its diameter is about 25 per cent larger than Jupiter and it
weighs twice as much.

It orbits a type F star located about 2,000 light-years from
Earth in the constellation Cygnus.

The hottest point on Kepler-76b isn't the sub stellar point
(or high noon) but a location offset by about 10,000 miles.
