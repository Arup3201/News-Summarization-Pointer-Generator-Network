A pet dog who was chased over a cliff by two deer survived the 60ft-fall after landing in thick brambles.

Pebbles, a Yorkshire terrier, was in her cliff-top back garden in Weymouth, Dorset, on Monday night when the two wild animals came in and chased after her.

The 16-year-old plunged down the cliff face and disappeared into the undergrowth and bushes below.

Pebbles, a 16-year-old Yorkshire terrier from Weymouth, Dorset, had a lucky escape when she fell off a 60ft cliff into some undergrowth after being chased by two deer

This shows how far Pebbles fell during the incident. Pebbles's owner Rob Cox tried to rescue the dog when he heard her whimpers from the bushes below but could not navigate the steep cliff in the dark

But when her owners, Rob and Lynne Cox, peered over the edge, they were relieved to hear their pet’s barks.

Mr Cox, 68, then used a torch to find his way down the cliff path in a bid to find the dog. But he was forced to give up after struggling to get through the bushes.

He said: 'We do get deer in our garden quite often and the other 
night while Pebbles was outside two of them chased her.

'She
 has got failing eyesight and she just fell over the edge of the cliff. 
It is a sheer drop but it is a bit of a jungle at the bottom.

Pebbles was said to be like a 'walking bush' after he was rescued by coastguard officers

'It
 was dark so I couldn’t see her but I could hear this whimpering bark. I
 went down the path with a torch but the batteries ran out and I ended 
up getting stuck in the bushes and badly scratched.'

The couple phoned the coastguards who set up search lights at the bottom of the cliff and cut a 15ft path through the brambles.

The team had attempted to reach Pebbles from the top of the cliff but decided to carry out the rescue from the bottom after finding it too risky.

They discovered Pebbles, buried in a prickly bush. And, despite looking like a 'walking bush', the dog was relatively unscathed.

Mr Cox said: 'After she was rescued pebbles was covered in brambles and twigs - she was like a walking bush.

'If it wasn’t for the coastguards I don’t think we would ever have found her.'

Tony Goss, the station officer for Wyke Regis coastguard, said: 'We cut a path through the undergrowth towards the barking and found the dog buried in it.

'It was pretty much a sheer drop from the top and the brambles must have cushioned her fall.'
