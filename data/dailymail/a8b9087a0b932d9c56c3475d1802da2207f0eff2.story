Airlines affected by a massive disruption at London airports are to be financially compensated after they were forced to cancel flights and pay for hotel rooms for stranded travellers, who are being denied compensation of their own.

Last Friday’s air traffic control computer glitch created chaos for passengers as 120 flights had to be cancelled and a further 500 were delayed by an average of 45 minutes while London airspace was shut.

It was all due to an 'unprecedented' computer failure at the headquarters of UK air traffic control company Nats at Swanwick, Hampshire.

In a statement provided to MailOnline Travel, Nats did not say how much the airlines will receive.

The agency said: ’NATS confirms that there will be a financial consequence for the company from the delay caused by the technical problem at Swanwick on 12 December 2014.

‘Under the company’s regulatory performance regime, customers will receive a rebate on charges in the future.

‘The amount is being is calculated and will be notified to customers in due course.’

Cancellations and delays were reported across the UK, and Heathrow was the worst-hit airport with 100,000 passengers affected. 

Passengers whose flights were cancelled or delayed are set to be denied compensation because of an EU loophole that allows airlines to claim the disruption was 'beyond their control', The Mail on Sunday reported. 

But Louise Ellman, who chairs the Commons Transport Select Committee, said passengers should be entitled to compensation.

British Airways provided hotel accommodation to passengers who were caught up in the disruption.

And passengers who were scheduled to travel last Friday evening from Heathrow, Gatwick or London City Airport were offered the option to either rebook their flight for a later date or claim a full refund.

Nats’ announcement comes a day after the agency’s bosses appeared before the House of Commons Transport Committee to explain the computer failure.

Nats chief executive officer Richard Deakin apologised to travellers and said his company’s contingency and back-up plans worked well.

He told the committee: ‘Any complex system will have failures,’ adding that it would be ‘unrealistic’ to expect there would be no failures.

Mr Deakin appeared alongside Nats operations managing director Martin Rolfe and Andrew Haines, chief executive of the Civil Aviation Authority, which has already launched an independent inquiry into the computer failure and is expected to report back by the end of March.

Mr Rolfe told MPs that the piece of equipment that failed last week dated from the mid-1990s and had dealt with 20 million flights and had been upgraded continually.

Earlier this week, the committee heard testimony from Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, who described the flight delays as ‘unacceptable’ and promised a ‘highly independent’ inquiry.

Asked if he agreed that the failure was ‘unacceptable’, Mr Deakin said: ‘For the passengers who got caught up in all this, yes, it was unacceptable, and by implication it was unacceptable for us as well.

‘We are not proud of what happened. We are proud of how we responded.’

There have been calls for Nats chief executive officer Richard Deakin to lose his bonuses

Mr Deakin denied a suggestion that he was ‘very, very complacent’ over the matter.

MP Paul Flynn is among those who have called for Mr Deakin to lose his bonuses. 

During questioning Mr Deakin confirmed that he received a £1.05million pay package, including a £272,000 bonus, for the 12 months ending last March.

But the bonus was cut by 12 per cent due to a flight disruption caused by another Swanwick problem in December 2013.

He said bonuses are linked to performance and Nats’ remuneration committee will decide if this year’s bonus will be cut over last week’s disruption.

He told the committee: ‘I can guarantee that this particular problem will not happen again but I cannot honestly sit here and say we will never have a computer glitch again.’

Mr Deakin said the latest figures showed 99.7 per cent of flights using UK air space face no delays. Of the 0.3 per cent that do, the average delay is 26 minutes.

Mr Rolfe, meanwhile, disagreed with a suggestion that Nats’ systems were ‘fundamentally flawed’.

Following last week’s disruption Business Secretary Vince Cable had questioned Nats’ investment levels.

Mr Deakin said there was no question of putting profit before investment and that investment levels were between 1.4 and 1.9 times higher than before the company was privatised.

He denied any suggestion that Nats’ systems were ‘ancient or antiquated’.

He said: ‘Just because technology is “old”, it does not necessarily mean that it is not fit for purpose.’
