The Tall Ships Festival kicked off in the Port of Los Angeles Wednesday with the arrival of an unusual guest - the world's largest rubber duck.

The canary-yellow 61-foot-tall bathtub toy sailed into port crowded with ships and filled with admiring crowds eager to catch a glimpse of the iconic artwork. It will remain in the harbor through Sunday.

Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman debuted the photogenic duck in 2007, and versions of it have been seen around the world in places including China, Hong Kong, Belgium, Japan and New Zealand.

A Tall Ships Festival spokesman said the duck is just one of the features of the weeklong event that comes to L.A. every three years.

On Wednesday morning, early risers rushed to Los Angeles’ San Pedro harbor just after dawn to witness the arrival of the 11-ton vinyl mallard, which sailed under the Vincent Thomas Bridge.

Hofman's larger-than-life piece of flotsam was greeted by a gaggle of excited onlookers armed with cameras trained on the inanimate celebrity.

Some guests even turned up at the event dressed in yellow and red - Rubber Duck's signature colors - to celebrate the festival’s guest of honor.

The giant floating sculpture was later towed to the Angels Gate Lighthouse to head a ship parade featuring more than a dozen vessels.

Some of the Tall Ships fired cannons as they made their way into the Main Channel following in the duck's wake.

More than 250,000 people are expected to take part in the maritime festivities headlined by the iconic duck.

‘This is 61 feet, 11 tons, about 85 feet wide and about 110 feet long [duck],’ festival spokesman Craig Samborski told ABC7. ‘I was shocked when I saw the size of it right in front of me.’

Organizers say Rubber Duck will be tied to a massive barge to keep it from floating away and will be lit up until 11pm each night through Sunday.

According to a poster board placed in the harbor telling the story of Hofman’s super-sized creation, the duck was inspired by a 1992 accident in which a shipment of bathtub toys fell overboard on its way from Hong Kong to Washington, reported The Daily Breeze.

Over the next 20 years, the rubber duckies and frogs from the doomed shipping crate washed ashore in Hawaii, South America, Alaska, and some even landed on icebergs in the Arctic.

The humble toys, dubbed by flotsam and jetsam collectors 'Friendly Floatees,' helped shed light on our understanding of sea currents and the North Pacific Gyre – a mammoth patch of floating garbage in the middle of the ocean.

The incredible adventure of the rubber duck flotilla was documented by journalist Donovan Hohn in his 2011 non-fiction book Moby-Duck: When 28,000 Bath Toys Are Lost at Sea.

As for Florentijn Hofman, the artist behind the famed duck is convinced that his vinyl creation can play an important role in the world.

'The friendly, floating rubber duck has healing properties: it can relieve tensions as well as define them. The rubber duck is soft, friendly and suitable for all ages!' he previously stated.
