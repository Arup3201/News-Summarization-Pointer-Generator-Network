Chelsea's players are back in the familiar surroundings of the clubs Cobham training ground, but one particular player has come back looking a little different.

Branislav Ivanovic has had the summer off after his native Serbia failed to qualify for the World Cup and it looks as though he might have had his razor blades confiscated from his luggage on the way back from a holiday.

And the versatile defender's facial fuzz bears a resemblance to that of new Roma signing Ashley Cole during his final few weeks at the Stamford Bridge club.
