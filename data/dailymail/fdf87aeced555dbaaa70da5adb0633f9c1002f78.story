A single mum successfully juggles the contrasting worlds of caring for her daughter and writing gay erotic fiction. 

Not only did Toni Griffin hate English when she was at school but she had never even considered writing a book until an idea popped into her head on the way to pick up her daughter from school about five years ago.

An avid reader, the Darwin resident went home and instead of picking up a book, she opened her laptop to see if she was capable of writing a book which was when her love of writing gay erotic fiction was born.

Not only did Griffin hate English when she was at school but she had never even considered writing a book until an idea popped into her head on the way to pick up her daughter from school about five years ago

The 32-year-old, who released her 20th book on Valentines day, has always been into reading straight erotic fiction and one day decided to give gay erotic fiction a go.

'I really enjoyed the story and have never looked back since,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

Surprisingly, many women feel the same way as at least two thirds of Griffin's fan base are in fact females.

'I find it difficult to explain what the attraction is - it's just something that is for me,' she said.

'Maybe it's the naughty aspect or just being able to escape the pressure of their lives into a little fantasy world.'

Griffin makes a point of keeping her career as separate as possible from her 11-year-old daughter, Adara.

'I like to spend as much time as I can possibly can with her so when she goes to bed - the laptop comes out,' she said.

'She knows she isn't allowed to read them until she is 18 but I'm not sure she knows the full extent of the content in the books.

'So she doesn't really ask any questions but she's proud of what I do.'

Griffin can't imagine ever writing anything other than gay erotic fiction novels

Griffin said she has only ever received positive feedback in the correspondence she receives from readers.

'When I tell some people what I do they often get a stunned look on their face but then ask lots of questions - while others think it's incredible and have a bit of a chuckle then also start asking questions,' she said.

It's not just humans who feature in Griffin's books with story lines including werewolves, hellhounds and vampire characters  - and even a necromancer series set in and around Darwin.

But Griffin doesn't expect to have any of her series of books to be the next Twilight series or even 50 Shade of Grey.

'I think there is much better writing out there before they would even thinking about mine,' she says modestly.

Griffin can't imagine ever writing anything but gay erotic fiction novels.

'My parents and lot of other people ask if I would ever write straight erotic fiction but I don't know if I even want to try to be honest - it doesn't draw me in as much.'
