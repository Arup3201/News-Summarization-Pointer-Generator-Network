Sir Mick Jagger's eldest son has posted a picture of himself online along with the caption 'stoned again'. 

James Jagger, 29, uploaded the picture on his Facebook profile pouting in front of the camera and wearing a big pair of dark sunglasses. 

The actor then captioned the photograph saying 'stoned again! How'd that happen??' 

Sir Mick Jagger's eldest son, James, posted this picture of himself with the caption 'stoned again!'

In the comments below, his friends laughed at his apparent reference to the class B drug cannabis. 

One said: 'Your days are backwards. Waking up tired and going to bed wide awake. Lol.' 

Another wrote: 'I am in no way judging you for taking drugs...I used to take drugs myself but I have been drug free for four years now.' 

James is the eldest son from Mick Jagger's marriage to former model Jerry Hall. 

The couple also had two daughters, Lizzie, 30, and Georgia, 23, and son Gabriel, 17, from their marriage of nine years. 

Jagger has three more children from other relationships and five grandchildren. He became a great-grandfather in 2014. 

Ms Hall claimed in an interview last year her children were put off drugs for life because they spent their childhood with Jagger's Rolling Stones bandmate Keith Richards, 71, 'passed out on the couch'. 

Asked why her children have not been known for alcohol and substance abuse, the 58-year-old said: 'Well, my kids are just very grounded, that's just never been an issue.

'I mean they spent their life looking at Keith Richards passed out on the couch, you know.'

James has worked as a model and been in several movies including Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll and Mr Nice in 2010. He is currently filming Gangster Kittens alongside his mother.

He will also play the singer of fictional punk band Nasty Bits in a TV series co-produced by his father for HBO in the US. 

James - who was an exemplary student during his GCSEs, achieving 5A*s, 5As, a B and a C (the C being in drama) - served as the frontman for a rock band called Turbogeist.
