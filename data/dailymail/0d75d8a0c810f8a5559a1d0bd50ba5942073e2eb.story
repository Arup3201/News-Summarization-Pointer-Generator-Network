A man who sparked an Ebola scare on board a flight from Milan to Dublin has been spared a criminal record and ordered to donate £2,000 to charity.

Fifty-six-year old Roberto Binaschi was arrested on Thursday, along with two women, after making a sick joke about the worldwide epidemic. The trio were taken to Ballymun Garda station.

A member of the cabin crew, on clearing away rubbish, was alarmed to find the words 'Attenzione Ebola' on the lid of a coffee cup, and it was discovered that Binaschi had written it while sharing 'a joke' with his daughter.

An Aer Lingus flight from Milan to Dublin was placed under emergency lockdown after Mr Binaschi's actions

After the air steward notified the captain and the Airbus A320 was put under emergency lockdown when it landed at Dublin Airport as medics were called to the scene. 

Binaschi, from Corso Argentina, Vigeavano, near Milan, was held overnight and brought before Dublin District Court on Friday morning. The two women were released without charge.

He admitted engaging in threatening, abusive, or insulting behaviour on an aeroplane contrary to the Air Navigation and Transport Act.

He made no further comment on the case, but judge Anthony Halpin called the incident 'a sick joke' and in light of the seriousness of Ebola, likened it to a bomb threat.

The judge accepted the apologetic nature of the Italian man, and ordered him to pay €2,500 which converts to around £2,000.

IT company director Mr Binaschi was travelling to Ireland with his family to attend a conference. 

Cabin crew discovered a coffee cup with the words ‘Attenzione Ebola’ written on it

Around 150 passengers and crew were forced to remain isolated on board flight EI433 on the runway apron for an hour while three of the passengers were medically examined.

Airport police placed a cordon at the aircraft, which was parked at a stand. 

Ireland's health service, the Health Service Executive, was also called in but an examination in consultation with experts established there was no evidence of a health risk.

Crew and passengers were allowed to disembark and the cordon was removed once the incident was determined to be a hoax. 

Thursday’s incident is the latest scare to occur aboard an aircraft as airports around the world screen passengers for the deadly Ebola virus.

Medical professionals are struggling to contain an outbreak in West Africa that has sickened more than 13,000 people and killed nearly 5,000 of them.
