The Mercedes F1 driver arrived at GQ Men of the Year event at the Royal Opera House alongside beautiful girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger.

Upon collecting his award, Hamilton said: 'I want to receive this for my family and for my team. I've been very fortunate to be in F1 for eight years now and I'm extremely grateful.'

The 29-year-old currently lies second in the world drivers' championship 29 points adrift of team-mate Nico Rosberg with the pair enduring a testing relationship this season that culminated in the German deliberately crashing into Hamilton at the Belgian Grand Prix.

The pair have since cleared the air with Hamilton insisting he will continue to give everything to win a second world championship title.
