Known as the City of the Century, it was once the centre of the country's booming steel industry.

But now Gary, Indiana, lies in ruins as a tragic example of American industrial decline.

Authorities are desperately looking at new ways to combat the city's crippling recession - one possiblity could be halving its size.

Decline: It was once the centre of the country's booming steel industry and known as the City of the Century. But now Gary, Indiana lies in ruins as a sad example of American industrial decline

Drastic: The mayor is now trying to come up with a drastic solution to save the city founded in 1906 by the US Steel Corporation

Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson believes letting vast expanses of the city, founded in 1906 by the US Steel Corporation, return to nature might be a solution.

'I’d like to see 100,000 folks in Gary. That’d be great,' the mayor said reported NBC News.

'We could probably do it in 35 square miles.'

That equation would see 25 percent more residents on nearly 40 percent less land.

Solution: An administration building in the decaying city. Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson thinks letting vast spanses of land return to nature might be a solution

Desolate: Deconstruction of a storage facility in Gary, Indiana. Gary's heyday was in the post-war boom of the 1950s when almost 200,000 people lived and worked in the bustling city, 25 miles from Chicago

The city now owns 7,000 properties in Gary - many of them have been taken for non-payment of taxes. 

Redevelopment Director Joe Van Dyk has worked out that 6,500 them are abandoned.

In the next few months the city is planning to auction off the housing for $1 each.

The homes would each need $15,000-$30,000 in repairs.

Buyers would have to agree to renovate their purchases as quickly as possible.

If buildings are beyond repair, NBC reports that a 'deconstruction' program could be initiated - to take apart  buildings and recycle materials.

Gary's heyday was in the post-war boom of the 1950s when almost 200,000 people lived and worked in the bustling city, 25 miles from Chicago.

As the American manufacturing sector contracted, Gary's population fell by over 50 percent and no one now uses the once bustling train stations, churches and auditoriums that are now decaying as they are left to the elements.

Booming in 1966: Gary Steel Works covered approximately 1500 acres of the Indiana shore of Lake Michigan and operated around the clock.

Cuts: This modern American ghost town began life as home for workers at the United States Steel Corporation plant until economic competition from abroad forced a 90 percent job cut

Frequently rated one of the ten most dangerous cities in the United States, Gary once boomed with jobs and opportunities but now faces the acute difficulties of America's growing rust belt, with 22 percent of families in the once-great city now lying below the poverty line.

This modern American ghost town began life as home for workers at the United States Steel Corporation plant until economic competition from abroad forced a 90 percent job cut.

Thirty-thousand jobs were gone in a flash and the flight of people away from Gary led to whole swathes of buildings being abandoned such as the once proud City Methodist Church which was built in the 1920s.

U.S. Steel paid $385,000 towards the $1 million construction costs of the church, which used to hold 950 people every Sunday and boasted a total congregation of 3,000.

The church also had a large school, gymnasium and an auditorium named the Seaman Hall where the city would hold community meetings, plays and musical events.

By 1970 the number of attendees for Sunday mass had fallen to 100 and in 1975 the church closed for good and began its long decent into despair.

Lying dormant and unused since then, many plans have been mooted to restore the place of worship including turning the vast empty spaces into a centre for performing arts or even to gracefully culture the ruins into an open garden.

However, with no funds and no concrete interest, the City of Gary has allowed the crumbling building to become a symbol of the decline of northwest Indiana and American industry.

Other building's such as the city's Union Station are potent reminders of the heights that Gary has fallen from.

Constructed to feed the growing city in 1910, the station lasted only another five decades before being closed and left to nature to take its course.

In fact, in 2008, the station was used as an example of what would happen to a Chicago building if no people were around to tend to its upkeep in the series 'Life After People'.

The 10,000 Gilroy Stadium on the western edge of Gleason Park in Gary, Indiana has laid in ruins since 1976, only 20 years after it opened.

With no one around the watch the football games in the city, the stadium was shut, but not before it had hosted Gary's most famous son's, the Jackson Five for a 1969 concert.

Ever since the 1990's successive mayor's of Gary have pledged to revitalize the city, but to date nothing has been realised.
