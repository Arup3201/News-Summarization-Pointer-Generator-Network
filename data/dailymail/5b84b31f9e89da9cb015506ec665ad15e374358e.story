Every day Sportsmail takes a look at the European papers to see what are the biggest stories creating talking points on the continent.

The Italian papers are dominated by transfer talk as the summer window begins to hot up in Serie A.

La Gazzetta dello Sports claim that Juventus are closing in on three new signings, with Manchester United defender Patrice Evra, Real Madrid striker Alvaro Morata and Verona forward Juan Iturbe reportedly on the verge of moves to Turin.

However the same newspaper also say that other clubs are making moves for Juve's talented midfield pairing of Arturo Vidal and Paul Pogba.

Tuttosport go big on Morata's potential move to Italy, although they say that the champions have not yet offered enough cash for Real to part with the 21-year-old Spaniard.

They also claim that Sampdoria are keen on free agent Esteban Cambiasso after his release from Inter Milan and that Atletico Madrid are interested in Torino winger Alessio Cerci.

Corriere dello Sport lead with quotes from Roberto Mancini, who says it would be an hour to take over from Cesare Prandelli and manage the Italian national team.

They also have an interview with Napoli striker Gonzalo Higuain, who says he will not be leaving Rafa Benitez's side this summer despite links with Spanish giants Barcelona.

Il Romanista use their entire front page to welcome Ashley Cole to Roma after the former Chelsea defender signed a two-year deal with the Serie A side.

The 33-year-old is aiming to win the Scudetto after his new side finished as runner-up last season.

Over in Spain the newspapers are dominated by the death of Real Madrid legend Alfredo di Stefano.

Mundo Deportivo go with the headline 'Goodbye to a legend', while AS opt for 'Always Don Alfredo, thanks for everything'.

The former striker, who is Real's leading goal-scorer of all time, passed away on Monday after suffering a cardiac arrest.
