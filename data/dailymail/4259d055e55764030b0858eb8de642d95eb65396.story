Arsenal winger Theo Walcott and his wife Melanie have spoken out over the distressing ordeal they had to go through following the birth of their son Finley.

The couple, speaking to Hello! magazine, learned their newborn baby had a heart defect shortly after his birth just under a year ago.

Walcott's wife said it was 'the longest two and a half hours of our lives' during Finley's operation to correct the problem with his heart.

Melanie said: 'Finley had a routine check and they found a murmur, which, again is normal. But it should go after 24 hours.

'But it didn't and it was discovered he had a valve that wasn't working properly.

'Basically, the heart was having to work really hard to get the blood to his lungs, which meant that the right side of his heart was getting bigger.

'Theo and I were so new to it all, you suddenly feel so vulnerable because it is all taken out of your control.' 

She continued: 'You've got this little person who is the most precious thing in the world and who you have this overwhelming urge to protect. It was a scary and emotional time.

'It was the longest two and a half hours of our lives but the staff were fantastic. Theo and I just tried to keep strong for each other.'

Finley, who will turn one on April 10, has made a full recovery since the operation at Royal Brompton hospital in London. 

During the interview, Melanie revealed that Finley is following in his father's footsteps by kicking footballs from his baby walker. 

She also said the pair have matching dimples and that they both scrunch up their toes when they are relaxed. 

Theo married Mel, his childhood sweetheart, in June 2013 at Castello di Vincigliata, near Florence in Italy.

The footballer had the castle location tattooed on his arm as a romantic reminder of their special day.

The couple started dating in 2004 after meeting at the WestQuay shopping centre in Southampton - when he was playing for the seaside town's youth team.

Melanie was billed as 'the new Coleen McLoughlin' by the media when Theo was selected by Sven-Göran Eriksson for the England squad in 2006.

However, Melanie never courted the press and kept a relatively low-profile compared to other WAGS and focused on her career as a sports physiotherapist.

The couple got engaged on New Year's Eve 2012 at their Hertfordshire home.
