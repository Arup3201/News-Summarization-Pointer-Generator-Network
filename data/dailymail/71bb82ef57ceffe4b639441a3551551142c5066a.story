Arsene Wenger has criticised Stoke forward Marko Arnautovic for his ‘unnecessary’ push on Mathieu Debuchy that has ruled the defender out for three months.

Debuchy has undergone surgery on his dislocated shoulder following a collision with the Potters forward in the 3-0 win at the Emirates last Sunday. 

Wenger refused to criticise Arnautovic after the game, but having watched the replays he says the nudge  was unnecessary.

Wenger said: 'He is destroyed because he is such a keen player, so professional, so willing. 

'It is his first year here and of course he is embarrassed. But it is not his fault. He was pushed. The push was not needed. 

'I watched it again and in that situation he was a bit unlucky as well because there is a little divot just after the touchline and maybe that made it worse.'

Asked whether he felt action should be taken against Arnautovic, Wenger added: 'I don’t know. I just think that Arnautovic had no chance to get the ball. That’s what I mean. I don’t think it was malicious but it was not needed because he had no chance to get the ball.

Debuchy will miss three months of the season following surgery on his shoulder

The 29-year-old was treated for six minutes before being substituted in the first half 

'I am not a specialist and these subjects are always very sensitive because I don’t really know what his intention was. It is difficult. It is not obvious. I don’t think he wanted to hurt him but it was not needed.' 

Wenger will also be without Mikel Arteta after the midfielder had surgery on his ankle. 

He added: 'Both had surgery. Debuchy for a shoulder problem that you saw last week against Stoke and Arteta for an ongoing problem with his ankle that provoked certain injuries in his calf.' 

Arsenal will also be without Danny Welbeck, who is two weeks away from being fit after a thigh injury, for the trip to Manchester City on Sunday but will have Aaron Ramsey, Mesut Ozil and Theo Walcott available.
