For 13-year-old Jacob Wisnik it was always going to be one of the biggest days of his life, but what he couldn't have imagined was the sybolism his Bar Mitzvah ceremony was going to carry.

While other teens would be celebrating their coming-of-age in synagogue halls across the United States, Jacob decided he wanted to honor his grandather by having his in the Polish town his grandfather fled in 1935.

There hadn’t been a Jewish service in the Zamosc Synagogue since before the Holocaust so it was fitting that Jacob decided to return to honor the struggle of his family.

The way it was: There hadn't been a Jewish service in the Zamosc Synagogue since before the Holocaust, until earlier this month when a 13-year-old New York boy came to the city his grandfather fled in 1935 to celebrate his Bar Mitzvah

Tribute: Jacob’s maternal grandfather escaped the Nazis when he was just a small child to the Soviet Union

Zamosc synagogue: Now 400 years old and once the spiritual center of a vibrant community, it is the city's sole link to its Hebrew heritage

'My grandfather, Abram Szlak, who was born in this town, would have become a Bar Mitzvah in this very synagogue if not for World War II,' said Jacob Wisnik to Fox News.

Jacob’s maternal grandfather escaped the Nazis when he was just a small child to the Soviet Union.

He, along with 6,000 of the 12,000 Jews living in Zamosc near the Ukrainian border fled.

The Nazis murdered those who remained.

Family portrait: Jacob¿s dad, Robert, said that all of the the family's ancestors were from Poland. His family came to America in the 1920s

New experience: 70 guests made the trip over to Poland to celebrate with Jacob. The majority were gentiles with most having never been to a Jewish service

Making a point: People have tried to destroy the Jews for thousands of years, Jacob said in his speech, as the Nazis tried during the Holocaust. But the Jewish people survive

Jacob's Bar Mitzvah is not just a milestone in his own life but also for the synagogue in which prayers and Torah chanting had not been heard in 75 years.

Jews had been in Zamosc since 1588, and nearly half of its 25,000 citizens were of the faith before the Nazi occupation.

Today, Zamosc has no Jews.

Its synagogue, once the spiritual center of a vibrant community, is the city's sole link to its Hebrew heritage.

The synagogue, more than 400 years old, was severely damaged and vandalized during the Nazi occupation.

Now restored, it is a cultural center used for lectures and concerts. 

There were 3.3 million Jews in Poland before the Holocaust. Only 10,000 remain.

Proud of his roots in history, Jacob looked to the future with optimism. 'Perhaps my Bar Mitzvah is the first of many more in Zamosc,' he said.

Rabbi David Holz, the Wisnik family’s rabbi from Westchester County, led the service, accompanying the songs with a guitar.

People have tried to destroy the Jews for thousands of years, Jacob said in his speech, as the Nazis tried during the Holocaust. But the Jewish people survive.

That was the message in his Torah reading, and his Bar Mitzvah in Zamosc was proof the attempted destruction hadn’t succeeded.

'Jake, you are the newest link in the unbroken chain of Jewish tradition through three thousand years, from Moses to this day,' the rabbi said.

Jacob’s dad, Robert, said that all of the the family's ancestors were from Poland. His family came to America in the 1920s.

His mom, Eva, and her parents arrived in the United States in 1968 when the Polish communist government launched an anti-Semitic campaign.

Spiritual: The sounds of prayers from the Torah had not been heard in the synagogue for 75 years

From generation to generation: Proud of his roots in this history, Jacob looked to the future with optimism. 'Perhaps my Bar Mitzvah is the first of many more in Zamosc,' he said

70 guests made the trip over to Poland to celebrate with Jacob. The majority were gentiles with most having never been to a Jewish service.

It was a new experience for high school teacher, Beata Pisarczyk-Zabicel. 'I thought it would be more formal,' she said. 'I was surprised by the guitar … and the clapping and singing. It was so joyful. I wanted to sing along.'

Pisarczyk-Zabicel’s student, Ewa Broszko, 18, said she’d read about Judaism, but actually seeing the Bar Mitzvah made her studies real.

In present-day Poland, many young Poles have never met a fellow Jew and are unaware about the vibrant Jewish past.

There are still anti-Semitic incidents in the country and graffiti appeared on the Zamosc Synagogue last fall.

A Polish non-profit is helping to promote tolerance in the country through education.

The Forum for Dialogue attempts to educating Poles about the Jewish religion and the country’s rich Jewish history.
