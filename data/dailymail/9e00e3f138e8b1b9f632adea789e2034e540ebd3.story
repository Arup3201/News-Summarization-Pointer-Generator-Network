She made her name starring in A Town Like Alice, but actress Virginia McKenna is still best known for the film Born Free.

It told the true story of pioneering conservation work being carried out in Kenya by Joy Adamson (Virginia) and her husband George (played by her real-life husband Bill Travers), and their efforts to return lion cub Elsa to the wild.

Virginia and Bill's experiences with the Adamsons and their growing concern for the plight of endangered African animals eventually led them in 1984 to establish the Born Free charity.

It works throughout the world 'to stop individual wild animals suffering and to protect threatened species'.

Thirty years on, Born Free has become a global charity with 100 employees, a £2million-a-year budget and a proud record in rescuing animals and rehoming them in sanctuaries.

Now aged 83 (her husband died 20 years ago), Virginia continues to wage a tireless battle on behalf of wild animals.

Recent terror activities in Kenya, which led to a toughening of Foreign and Commonwealth Office advice on travelling in the country, are also causing her great concern.

'A big fall in the number of UK tourists to Kenya will have serious implications for the wildlife,' she says. 

'It would be such a tragedy if a small number of extremists, doing such harsh and terrible things, brought about the end of tourism - the industry accounts for about 12 per cent of Kenya's economy.

'Without tourism, what will happen to the country and the livelihood of the indigenous people? One has to think about that too.' 

Virginia believes that the presence of tourism in Kenya's national parks is vital for the safety of wildlife.

Rangers and drivers provide constant monitoring - without that monitoring, there must be a concern about the welfare of those animals facing threats from poachers.

'Perhaps the advice to travellers ought to differentiate between travel in the parks and travel elsewhere in Kenya,' says Virginia.

'The violence in Nairobi, for example, has not been in an area perhaps that most of the tourists go to.' She is hopeful the country's troubles will be short-lived. 

'I'm always optimistic. I would just hate anything to destroy Kenya, this wonderful country.

'There's something about Africa, about the skies, the clouds, the silence, and yet it's filled with sound. It isn't human sound. It's usually birdsong and animal sounds. 

'A break in Kenya is an uplifting experience.'
