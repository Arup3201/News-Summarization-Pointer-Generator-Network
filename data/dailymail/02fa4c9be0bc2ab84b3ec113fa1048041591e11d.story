They are the U.S. Navy's flight demonstration squad, and judging by how they fly during practice, these daredevils are worth watching.

A video showing four Blue Angels pilots steering their planes dangerously close to each other has emerged on YouTube.

The pilots fly their F/A-18 Hornets fly in a tight diamond formation, one which the squadron has made their trademark move.

The job of piloting in the Blue Angels does not come without risk, and throughout its 68-year history, 26 pilots have been killed in air show or training accidents, giving the job a 10 per cent fatality rate.

The video emerged just days after a former commanding officer of the Blue Angels precision flying team was relieved of duty because of unspecified alleged misconduct.

Capt. Gregory McWherter was removed from his post as executive officer of Naval Base Coronado, where he had served since November, officials said in a statement.

An investigation continued into recent allegations of an ‘inappropriate command climate’ at the Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron based at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, the statement said.

The allegations refer specifically to the period when McWherter served as Blue Angels commanding officer, from November 2008 to November 2010 and again from May 2011 to November 2012.

The probe, led by an admiral who the Navy declined to identify, began in March and results from a complaint filed by one person, said Commander Mike Kafka, a spokesman for the Naval Air Force Atlantic Command based in Norfolk, Virginia.

Kafka said in an interview with the Pensacola News Journal that there are no changes to the Blue Angels 2014 air show and practice schedule ‘at this time.’
