Samuel Eto'o and Romelu Lukaku will be desperate to prove a point when Everton play Chelsea at Goodison Park on Saturday  after Jose Mourinho let both strikers leave the club during the summer transfer window.

Eto’o, who signed a two-year-deal with the Toffees on Wednesday, could make his debut against the side where he scored 12 goals in 34 appearances last season.

In February, Mourinho was caught questioning the striker’s age but the 33-year-old responded by calling his old boss a ‘fool’.

He left the club when his contract expired in July.

Lukaku was also deemed surplus to requirements by Mourinho. 

Chelsea paid around £20million for him in 2011 but he played just 15 times and, after a successful loan spell at Goodison Park last season, joined permanently for £28million in July.
