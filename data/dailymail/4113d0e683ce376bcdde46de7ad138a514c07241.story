Forensic staff could not find any conclusive evidence of Mr Assange¿s DNA on a torn condom given to Swedish police by one of the alleged  victims

Lawyers for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange have revealed that a key piece of evidence does not contain his DNA.

A torn condom given to Swedish police by one of the alleged  victims was examined by staff at two forensic laboratories but they could not find any conclusive evidence of Mr Assange’s DNA on it.

The same forensic teams found DNA thought to belong to the WikiLeaks boss on another condom, which was submitted by the second alleged victim.

The revelation is contained in a 100-page police report that was written after witnesses were  interviewed and forensic evidence had been examined.

The report, which has been seen by Mr Assange’s lawyers, has led to the Swedish authorities requesting his extradition from Britain to stand trial, though he is yet to be charged with any offence.

Mr Assange, who denies allegations of rape and sexual molestation, has been fighting extradition to Sweden for the past two years. He claims it is a ruse to send him to the United States where he could face trial for espionage.

The 41-year-old is currently holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London after being granted asylum by the country’s president, Rafael Correa.

In the report, the first alleged 
victim, now 33, claims she was sexually molested by Mr Assange at her 
flat in Stockholm on  several occasions.

She
 also claims that Mr Assange deliberately ripped a condom before 
wearing  it so that he could have unprotected sex with her against her 
will.

Julian Assange is currently holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London after being granted asylum by the country's president, Rafael Correa.

His lawyers have said that the fact no DNA could be found  conclusively on an apparently used condom suggests a fake one may have been submitted.

The report also appears to cast doubt on the claim made by the second alleged victim, who told police that she was ‘raped’ by  Mr Assange when she was asleep.

But during a police interview,  the woman, now 29, apparently suggests that she did not mind  him having unprotected sex  with her.

The Swedish prosecutor’s office refused to comment on the report but said the case was ongoing.
