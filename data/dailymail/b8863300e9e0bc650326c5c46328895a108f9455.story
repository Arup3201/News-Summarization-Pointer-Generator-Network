An intricate watch concealed within a gleaming £5 gold coin that was a love gift from King Edward VIII to his first mistress is expected to sell for thousands when it goes under the hammer next week.

The young Prince of Wales gave the beautiful token of his affection to Freda Dudley Ward some years after he had a passionate affair with the married socialite in 1918.

The pair had romantically met in a doorway in London’s Mayfair as they sheltered from a Zeppelin raid during the First World War.

Intricate: This watch hidden inside a gold coin which King Edward VIII gave to his first mistress Freda Dudley is expected to fetch at least £15,000 when it is auctioned in London next week

Artistic: The beautiful front and back of the coin watch. Edward had met Freda Dudley-Ward in doorway as they sheltered from a bombing raid

Beautiful: Prince Edward was presented with the wafer-thin watch created inside the 1902 £5 gold coin when he opened the Scottish Motor Exhibition in 1927

The Prince of Wales broke off the relationship in 1934 when Wallis Simpson came into his life - the relationship which sparked the dramatic abdication crisis.

Prince Edward was presented with the wafer-thin watch, created inside the 1902 £5 gold coin, when he opened the Scottish Motor Exhibition in 1927 and had it engraved with the initials ‘F’ and ‘D’, for his pet name David, and presented it to his secret lover.

Auctioneer James Grinter said: 'This watch is a unique piece of Royal history linked to the man who became the Duke of Windsor and we are expecting a lot of interest from collectors around the world.'

The watch is due to go under the 
hammer a week tomorrow at Colchester auctioneers Reeman Dansie’s sale of
Royal memorabilia which includes items from the Queen, Princess Diana, 
the Queen Mother, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and other monarchs. It is estimated to reach between £10,000 and £15,000.

Mr
Grinter said: 'The watch has a beautifully-made, extremely thin 
18-jewel movement by Stablis of Switzerland so it can actually be closed
on a hinge inside the £5 coin.

'The
Prince was obviously impressed by the concept because he later bought a
very similar £5 gold coin watch from Cartier for Wallis Simpson and 
that sold two years ago at Sotheby’s for £27,500.'

The Prince of Wales and Freda Dudley Ward were both 23 when they met in 1918 and began their affair.

She had already been married for five years and had two daughters by a husband 16 years her senior, but that didn’t stop the Prince bombarding her with extravagant gifts - including the watch.

Next week’s Royal sale also includes a rare dinner menu from the Canadian steamship RMS Lady Somers signed by the Duke of Windsor and Wallis Simpson as they sailed to the Bahamas in August 1940, where the Duke was due to take up his post as Governor.

The signed menu, which is estimated at £250 to £350, shows the couple dined on dishes including Canapes de Langouste Rossini and Roast Quarters of Lamb a la Menthe.

Reeman Dansie’s Royal memorabilia sale is in Colchester on June 19.
