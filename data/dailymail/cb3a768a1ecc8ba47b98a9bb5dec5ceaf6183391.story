A designer has launched a line of cheeky jewellery for women with ample assets.

In an attempt to inject some humour into the way jewels adorn the body, the line of necklaces depict tiny figurines enthusiastically 'diving' into the wearer's cleavage.

While a diver model appears to be free falling at will, others seem to be carefully lowering themselves down a rope while others climb down the chest. All appear to be male.

Dubbed Tanima Divers, the collection is the brainchild of Japanese designer Takayuki Fukusawa, head of EkoD Works (of Error Code Works).

He insists that he's trying to challenge 
the norms of society through his 'art', and says his life's goal is to 
create funny and playful designs that brighten people's days.

According to his design firm he wants to continue to create objects that make people say 'he made another ridiculous thing'.

The new range of cheeky pendants follow the firm's mantra, 'to make a world full of humorous art and design'.

Fans are warned the provocative and eye-catching necklaces are prototypes, and EkoD Works hope to release them at the end of the year at a yet-to-be-disclosed price point.

They are currently trying to raise 400,000 yen (about Â£2,310) by the end of this month for the project on Japanese crowd funding website camp-fire.jp

And this is not the first breast-obsessed design the company has come up with.

Last year Takayuki, 30, created his Delusion Mapping Project - a series of T-shirts with hyper realistic prints of women's bras.

Called the 'peek-a-boo', the printed tops aim to, in the words of the designer, 'bring to life the world of delusion that people secretly envision'.

'The time when our imaginings can be kept private in our minds has long passed. So, everyone don a delusion mapping t-shirt and jump into a new world of ambitious dreams!'

Sure to attract a giggle or lustful look if worn out in public, you can even chose a variety of colours for the bra underneath, and there are different breast shapes available - though all are a generous size.
