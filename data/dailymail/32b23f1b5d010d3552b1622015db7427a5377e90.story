A 6-month-old puppy is currently recovering after being hit by a speeding train—and veterinarians say it was that very speed that saved the animal’s life.

Last week, Jessie, a Border Collie mix, was hit by a train in Denver, Colorado’s light rail fleet.

The Light Rail called Denver animal control on Friday to report they’d hit a dog. It wasn’t until Saturday that Jessie was finally spotted.

Recovering: Jessie, a 6-month-old Border Collie mix, is now healing after a train all but amputated her left hind leg last week

She was alive, despite her left hind leg hanging limp and partially amputated from her body.

According to a veterinary surgeon, Jessie was saved by the train’s high speed and the heat of tracks.

Dr. Brian Van Vechten of the Veterinary Referral Center of Colorado (VRCC) said Jessie’s wound was cauterized by the extreme impact, which allowed her to survive until her rescue.

Surgeons at the VRCC had to completely amputate the leg, however.

Lucky: Jessie's injuries look gruesome, but veterinarians say the extreme heat and speed of the train that hit her May 17 cauterized her wound and allowed her to live through the night

But, says Van Vechten, Jessie is going to be just fine.

‘Three-legged dogs do really well,’ Dr. Van Vechten told KUSA. ‘She's young. She will adapt quickly to this, and she will still be faster than any of us on three legs.’

Though it has been only a handful of days, footage of Jessie shows a nimble, healthy dog ready to take a bit out of life.

Jessie’s owner says the dog had been missing for days prior to the accident.

Thriving: Jessie is already active again after she was hit by the Denver light rail (pictured) and veterinary surgeon Brian Van Vechten says 'She's young. She will adapt quickly to this'

Major loss: Once Jessie was found, her hind leg was fully amputated, as seen in this x-ray. Vets say she will continue to live a full life

He was reportedly out of town when the accident occurred, having left the dog in the care of a friend, when Jessie escaped.

The owner says he’s still looking forward to taking Jessie on camping and hiking trips during the summer.

Jessie, meanwhile, could still require more surgery, depending on how her injury heals.

Still happy: Jessie escaped while her owner was out of town and someone else was watching her. Now, her owner looks forward to a summer of hiking and camping with his lucky puppy
