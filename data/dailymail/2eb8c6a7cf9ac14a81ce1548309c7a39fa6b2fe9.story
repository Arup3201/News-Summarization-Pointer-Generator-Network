There's always one show-off in a gang and it seems dolphins are no exception.

This bottlenose certainly takes the biscuit – or in the case the fish – with its acrobatic display.

Fins and tails above the rest, the creature shoots metres into the air before twisting and diving down to grab a salmon near Fortrose on the Moray Firth.

The bottlenose dolphin is well known for being a friendly creature, but this is the moment an entire pod showed another side to their playful nature

The pod of 20 dolphins had been 
laying in wait for the annual 'salmon run', where they can be guaranteed
a tasty snack as hundreds of fish swim from the sea back to freshwater 
to spawn.

There is believed to be around 300 bottlenose dolphins in the area, which is the most northern colony in the world.

The pod of 20 dolphins were spotted hunting their supper at Chononry Point near Fortose on the Moray Firth in Scotland.

There is believed to be around 300 bottlenose dolphins - Tursiops truncatus in Latin - in the area, which is the most northern colony in the world.

Amateur photographer Alister Kemp, 47, was watching from the shore and managed to captured a series of stunning shots.

Alister, from Evanton in Ross-Shire, said: 'I took these pictures when the salmon were returning to the river to spawn during low tide.

The clever animals had been laying in wait for the annual 'Salmon Run', where they could be guaranteed a tasty snack as hundreds of fish made the upstream struggle

As schools of salmon swam from the sea back to freshwater to spawn, a group of dolphins showed off their predatory skills and began to hunt them

'Once the dolphins have got a fish they will throw it out of the water and then you will see them leap out after it.

'We get lots of people here coming to watch the dolphins and everyone thinks they are very cute but they do have those wild instincts.

'I have taken hundreds of pictures of the dolphins over the years but I think these could be my best so far.

'Sometimes I have waited two to three hours to see them but I have also been there at just the right time to spot them, when the tide has just started to come in.'
