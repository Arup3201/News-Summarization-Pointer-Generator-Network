Theresa May said the issue of tax credits for migrants was 'being looked at' 

Migrant workers could be stripped of up to £100million a week in tax credits under Tory plans to seize the initiative from Ukip on immigration.

Home Secretary Theresa May has told the Daily Mail that the Treasury is conducting detailed work on ways to restrict access to tax credits, which are seen as a major ‘pull factor’ for migrants to the UK.

'The tax credits issue is something the Treasury has looked at and the Treasury is continuing to look at it,' she said.

Britain spends £5billion a year on tax credits to migrants – from both inside and outside the EU.

The subsidies – which are available upon arrival and top up lower-paid jobs – can treble the take-home pay of a worker with a family on minimum wage.

Any attempt to restrict the right of EU nationals to in-work benefits will spark a ferocious row with Brussels.

The dramatic plan emerged as David Cameron warned he will campaign to quit the EU unless it agrees to let Britain curb the free movement of workers to this country. 

Visiting Rochester, where the Tories face a must-win by-election against Ukip, the Prime Minister warned he was willing to give the EU 'one last go'.

He called for a wholesale retreat from the principle of ‘ever closer union’ and a return to the founding purpose of the EU as a Common Market, declaring he did not want ‘a European army, European flag or a European country’.

Ministers are pushing for a so-called ‘emergency brake’ on arrivals from EU states if numbers exceed expectations.

In a public meeting with locals yesterday, Mr Cameron was asked if he ‘could really win back powers from Europe’.

He said: ‘I think we can get what we’re looking for because the fact is it’s worth one last go trying to get a better relationship with Europe. 

'I think it is worth one last go. I’m not happy with how things are at the moment – but I also think the rest of Europe actually wants us to stay.’

Speaking in Rochester ahead of a by-election triggered by Ukip defector Mark Reckless, the Prime Minister urged voters to consider 'one last go' of improving relations with Brussels 

David Cameron said the Tories still could get what they wanted out of the EU. His comments came during a visit to Rochester where the Tories go against Nigel Farage's Ukip

Amid signs of growing Tory panic about the impact of Ukip, it also emerged Chief Whip Michael Gove was floating the idea of withdrawing from the European Arrest Warrant to prevent a damaging revolt. 

More than 100 Tory MPs are threatening to rebel on the issue, which is set to come back to the Commons next month. The scheme allows foreign police to demand the arrest of suspects here.

Ministers have already acted to restrict access to out-of-work benefits for migrants in and outside the EU. But many experts believe the lure of in-work benefits is far greater.

According to the Government’s Migration Advisory Committee, 415,000 foreign nationals are benefiting from the perk – worth the equivalent of almost £100million a week.

The MigrationWatch campaign group found a migrant with no dependants earning the minimum wage has their net income of about £184 a week boosted to £254 by tax credits and housing benefit. 

If they have a partner and two children, it rockets from £184 to £543. The benefit increases depending on the size of a family. State handouts can constitute 66 per cent of a total annual income of £28,241.

Compared with back home, a family from Romania and Bulgaria could multiply their take-home pay by eight.

Mrs May said: ‘This is an example of the sort of thing where you constantly look to see if there are more steps you can take. It is something we look to see if, within the current arrangements, there is anything we can do.’

Mr Cameron yesterday made the first of five expected visits to Rochester, where the Tories are battling to defeat former MP Mark Reckless, who defected to Ukip. 

He said: ‘We need to get back, frankly, to what we were told we were going to join in the first place and that’s why I’m very passionate about getting Britain out of what’s called ever-closer union.’
