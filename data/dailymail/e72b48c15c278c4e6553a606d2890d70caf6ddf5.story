He was the flawed genius who was famous for his exuberant approach to fashion, his love of the theatrical and his clever grasp of cut.

Now some of Alexander McQueen's most striking designs are to go on display at the V&A in London, among them 30 previously unseen pieces.

Savage Beauty originally went on display at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art in the wake of McQueen's death in 2010 but will relocate to London in the Spring.

New sections will include one that focuses on the early years of his career in London, as well as garments lent by stylist - and McQueen's close friend - Katy England, the Isabella Blow Collection and the House of Givenchy.

The Cabinet of Curiosities will be expanded, with pieces created by McQueen in collaboration with milliner Philip Treacey and jeweller Shaun Leane included in the display.

McQueen, who was found dead on the 11th February 2010, was one of the UK's most influential designers and the owner of a little black book that encompassed everyone from royals to first ladies and fashion editors.

The son of a taxi driver and a social science teacher, the glittering world he came to inhabit was a far cry from the humble terraced home in Lewisham, south London, where he grew up with his five brothers and sisters.

Clever: As this SS04 collection reveals, McQueen never lost his passion for the theatrical

After leaving school at 16 with a single O-Level in art, the fledgling designer went on to do an apprenticeship at Savile Row tailors Gieves & Hawkes, before a stint at theatrical costumiers, Angels and Bermans. Both would have huge influence on his later career. 

McQueen's big break came following a spell in Milan working for Romeo Gigli. On his return to London, he applied to Central St Martins for work as a pattern cutter.

Impressed by his portfolio, Bobby Hilson, the head of the master's course, persuaded him to enrol as a student instead. His faith in McQueen paid off. The designer's graduate collection earned him rave reviews and the entire thing was bought by Isabella Blow.

From there, McQueen went on to become one of the most influential designers of his generation, designing David Bowie's tour wardrobe in 1996 and following up with his infamous 'bumsters' - which then sparked a craze for low slung jeans.

The same year, he was appointed creative director at Givenchy, replacing fellow Briton John Galliano, and relocated to Paris.

Genius: Alexander McQueen, who died in February 2010, was one of Britain's most influential designers

But despite his success, McQueen never forgot his London roots, often speaking of his love for the British capital.

Indeed, he once spoke of how inspiring he found the V&A itself, saying: 'The collections at the V&A never fail to intrigue and inspire me.

'The nation is privileged to have access to such a resource... it's the sort of place I'd like to be shut in overnight.'

The museum repaid the compliment, first by including the designer's work in Cutting Edge: 50 Years of British Fashion in 1997, and then again in its Fashion in Motion series.

But it is Savage Beauty that will be the largest retrospective of McQueen's work hosted by the museum, with more than 200 different pieces set to go on show.

Wonderful: Philip Treacey and Shaun Leane were regular collaborators and made these spectacular hats

Legacy: Although the designer is gone, his label lives on in the capable hands of designer Sarah Burton

Among the pieces included are gowns from his 1992 postgraduate collection, as well as some of his A/W10 designs - the last he would ever create.

His final collection was never completed, with just 16 dresses shown to fashion editors in Paris a month after he died.

But while McQueen might be gone, his brand lives on and, in the capable hands of his former assistant Sarah Burton, continues to go from strength to strength. 

'Lee was a genius and a true visionary who pushed boundaries, challenged and inspired,' she explains.

'He believed in creativity and innovation and his talent was limitless. Savage Beauty is a celebration of the most imaginative and talented designer of our time.'
