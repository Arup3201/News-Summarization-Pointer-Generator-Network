Rory McIlroy allowed himself a two-day celebration after winning The Open at Hoylake. After winning his first World Golf Championship title on Sunday, it was more like two hours.

Monday lunchtime and the Northern Irishman was back at work, on a scouting trip for the season’s final major, the US PGA Championship at Valhalla this week.

Greatness waits for no man.

We have seen wondrous golf from him before, and stretches of rare brilliance. But what we are seeing right now is on another level. It is not what very good or even top-class golfers do. It is what men who define eras do.

‘I just want to see how many titles I can win and then enjoy them at the end of the year,’ he said. ‘I know I’ve have had some success this season but I do feel I’ve a few more left in me.’

There has only been one golfer in my working lifetime for whom Open Championships were not enough or WGCs, and so the symmetry at the Bridgestone Invitational on Sunday was perfect, if somewhat poignant. As poor Tiger Woods was being led from the scene crocked, his days of thinking like this shattered forever, his successor strode into the arena looking the epitome of athleticism.

Not since Woods was in his prime have we seen a mood descend like the one over the back nine at Firestone on Sunday. The margin between McIlroy and the luckless Sergio Garcia was only a stroke for much of the time, yet the final outcome did not feel in doubt.

‘I’ve never felt so comfortable trying to close out a tournament,’ said McIlroy. ‘It felt like the first or second round rather than the fourth.’

When a player reaches that stage, he is in the happiest place of all. And when you combine it with McIlroy’s gifts and single-minded pursuit of maximising them, we are back in Tiger territory, where the opposition feel intimidated before they begin.

Garcia is playing as well as he has for a decade and began with a three-stroke lead. But never did you sense a player who felt he could truly win.

The Spaniard has been one of the best drivers of the ball for 15 years but looked positively cowed next to the awesome McIlroy. 

Watching on television, Tony Jacklin, no mean driver of the ball himself in his heyday, came to a momentous conclusion: ‘In all my time in the game, I’ve never seen anyone drive the ball like Rory did last week.’ 

Jack Nicklaus defined his era by dominating the opposition with the elixir of power and accuracy from the tee, and when he managed to putt well into the bargain, he won.

That is how McIlroy will do it as well. OK, the fairways at Firestone last week were soft, and the ball was not rolling into the rough. That will certainly improve a man’s driving-accuracy stats.

Against that they were narrow targets, particularly if you are flying the ball more than 325 yards through the air. Yet McIlroy missed just two fairways per round, and not one all week by a sizeable margin. It was stunning to behold.

Why has it all gone right for McIlroy? The bottom line is he has fallen head over heels back in love with his sport. He has ditched all the baggage and re-dedicated himself.

Winner: Rory McIlroy has won his third Grand Slam at the age of 25, becoming only the third to do so

Rory McIlroy's success at the Bridgestone Invitational owed a lot to his driving. The 25-year-old led the field in driving distance with an average of 334.8 yards, and, remarkably maintained a high level of accuracy at 60.71 per cent (tied 12th) missing just nine out of 56 fairways.

Typically, someone who hits it as far as McIlroy ranks low down in terms of accuracy. Bubba Watson is No 1 for distance this season with an average of 314.8 yards but 98th for accuracy. 

Was his former fiancee Caroline Wozniacki’s remark in April that she would like children a turning point? McIlroy was not ready for children. He is 25 and wants trophies, not babies. ‘I never wanted to be a normal person growing up,’ he said last week. ‘I wanted to be the golfer who wins majors.’

After Caroline went, the next thing was the Olympic question that had been hanging over him, and who he would represent at Rio.

Then he had a long sitdown with Nicklaus, the man who has come to look upon Rory with the same affection as one of his many grandchildren. Do not underestimate that 90-minute conversation the pair had at the end of May in all we are seeing now. Nicklaus always recognised that McIlroy was a once-in-a-generation talent. He was only too happy to dwell on the fine details to help bring it out.

I know I have banged on about McIlroy ad nauseam over the years, to the annoyance of some readers.

‘Why do you keep writing about him? He is not that good,’ was the gist. But the point always was that he is that good.

Lead from the front: McIlroy now only needs to win The Masters to complete a career Grand Slam

Now, with everything pointing in the right direction, there is every chance the next few years will be the most exciting in the history of European golf. No, he will not dominate to the extent Tiger did. He will not end up with 79 PGA Tour victories. 

But if he can keep all the melodrama at bay — a big if, admittedly, on the evidence of the past few years — he should be winning five times or more each season and quite a few of them should be majors.

Back in March, McIlroy sat down with a few golf writers and made a comment that now carries particular resonance. ‘I think the game is crying out for someone to take it by the scruff of the neck and dominate and, of course, I’d like that golfer to be me,’ he said.

Now someone has and, yes, it is him. So settle back. Rory has got the aura and when a golfer acquires that, an era surely follows.
