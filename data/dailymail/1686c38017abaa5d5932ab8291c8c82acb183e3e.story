Is Yaya right to be angry over birthday snub?

Yaya Toure's agent has claimed the midfielder could quit Manchester City this summer, with the Ivorian feeling the club is not giving him enough attention.

Toure has backed Dimitri Seluk's bizarre attack on Manchester City for forgetting the midfielder's birthday and says he will clarify his future after the World Cup.

Seluk told talkSPORT: 'If you ask 100 per cent or 50-50 [if Toure will stay], better 50-50 than 100.

Going back? Toure could return to Barcelona this summer, the club he played for between 2007 and 2010

'Of course it's not the question of 
money, it's more importantly about the relationship. Normally everything
 is good, yes they win Premier League.

Seluk said that the club should have given Toure a prize after he missed out on the PFA Player of the Year award to Luis Suarez.

'Okay,
 Suarez wins best player, his decision is his decision. But Yaya did not
 win. Normally the club must say something, make a prize to him, 
something a little bit more, like 'Okay Yaya you had a great season' or 
something special, a cake.

When
 asked if Barcelona are a possible destination for Toure this summer, 
Seluk said: 'Barcelona we know are a former club of Yaya, and all the 
staff at Barcelona, and players, liked him and supported us. He had a great time there and it’s like another home for him.

'It's
 possible to find solutions, and the player will be happy. It's not a 
question of money or no money. Always more attention must be given to 
player, more motivation for the future. This is my opinion and the 
opinion of course of Yaya.

'Of course it's not the question of

 is good, yes they win Premier League.

'When
 he plays in the team, like any player, he says "I will be in team where
 the team loves me, if people or supporters don't love me I can leave."

'This
 is very important because he fights for Man City but he fights for Man 
City and they don't fight for him. He is very upset.

Happy birthday to you! City posted this on their Twitter on May 13

'The
 main thing is attention. Somebody in their job, in newspaper or in 
radio, if the company will shake his hand and congratulate him on his 
birthday he will be happier and life will be better and nicer.

'If people don't give attention to us we will forget about these peopole and work with other people.

'Some
 people can say what they want, but i tell you this is not about cake, 
more importantly it is about attention. Yaya can buy cake for everybody 
and it's no problem from him.

'Believe me, I bought him everything [for his birthday].'

And
 Toure earlier tweeted: 'My agent was trying to make a point here on my 
behalf, joke aside.It seems important for me to make a statement.. I am 
going to do so.

'Everything dimitry said is true. He speaks for me. I will give an interview after world cup to explain.'
