Russian fashionistas are famous for their love of bling. But even the most ostentatious Muscovite might find the gold bodice and body paint get-up that appeared at Moscow Fashion Week last night a touch over the top.

The brainchild of British designer duo, Fyodor Golan, the odd creation was one of the most outrageous looks from the fashion event so far.

It wasn't the only bizarre outfit to appear on the catwalk either, with everything from lilac lace face masks to ammonite-inspired collars cropping up on the runway.

Bizarre: The British duo also sent this extremely odd look down the catwalk during their Moscow show

Fyodor Golan came up trumps with another strange look, which included a lilac and blue lace face-covering hat, teamed with yet another bodice and a spangled all in one.

But although the British pair led the brash pack, they had plenty of competition from homegrown designers.

Designer Gera Skandal lived up to her name, taking Spiderman as her inspiration and sending a succession of eccentric sheer monochrome jumpsuits down the runway.

Other male models to suffer from the creative whims of local designers included the chaps at Ekaterina Sidelnikova, who sent her long-suffering runway stars down the catwalk in odd modern caveman type creations, and those at TaiDo, who wore fur coats with what looked like a deluxe version of a dog collar.

Long-suffering: TaiDo's collar and coat combo, and Ekaterina Sidelnikova's modern caveman

Ruban: Lovely dress, shame about the hat

Pirosmani: Is this the world's most bouffant fringe?

Ekaterina Vasilieva: A novel collar inspired by an ammonite fossil

Show stopper: Ukrainian actress Olga Kurylenko showed Moscow's fashionistas how its done

The girls didn't escape the weirdness either, with Ruban sending models out in chic tailored dresses teamed with bizarre gnome-like hats.

Equally odd were the bouffant fringes at Pirosmani which looked witchy peeking out from voluminous black hooded capes.

Meanwhile, Ekaterina Vasilieva appeared to take inspiration from ammonite fossils, with a strange set of collars that strongly resembled the prehistoric mollusc.

But not every look was a bad one. Gold body paint aside, the rest of Fyodor Golan's collection included some wonderfully wearable dresses, among them a standout red brocade shift.

Taya Dodina's wonderful pansy photo prints were good enough to be confused with Erdem, while Tatiana Sulimina offered up a collection crammed with delicate maxi dresses.

Also worth a second look was Dasha Gauser's riff on monochrome that resulted in quirky black and white candy stripes splashed on everything from boots to coats.

But even Gauser couldn't hold a candle to the truly fashionable Olga Kurlyenko, who wowed the Muscovite fashion pack with her bold choices at the Moscow premiere of Oblivion.

Appearing with co-star, Tom Cruise, the Ukrainian actress' wardrobe choices included a stunning dusty blue lace dress and a flattering deep purple printed coat.
