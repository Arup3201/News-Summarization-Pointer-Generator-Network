Police are probing a borehole in a cemetery containing the remains of murdered concentration camp victims which they believe was dug by Nazi treasure hunters searching for the fabled Amber Room of the tsars.

Ever since a book called 'The Puzzle of Poppen Wood' by Mario Ulbrich was released two years ago the search for the fabled treasure has lured legions of hunters to the scene of old mine workings in eastern Germany seeking the fortune estimated at over 150 million pounds.

Ulbrich interviewed foresters, policemen, miners and old Nazis for his work which chronicles two decades of largely unreported quarrying in the wood near Zwickau in east Germany.

But now a borehole has been discovered in the village of Bad Schlema in Saxony which mayor Jens Mueller says is a dig too far.

‘This is a place of rest for 42 victims of the Nazis,’ he said.  ’It is too much.  It is the work of the treasure hunters.’

Ulbrich goes into detail in his book about old silver, cobalt and uranium mine workings that, at nearly 6,000 feet underground, were the deepest in Germany with some shafts and galleries dating back to the middle ages.

Eyewitness reports from the time speak of a special S.S. commando unit turning up at the wood early in 1945, sealing it off and dumping a secret cargo in it.  With German shattered and its transportation infrastructure in ruins, believers say it must have been a singularly important cargo they hid there.

Searchers have found rotting wooden storage crates from WW2 in the woods but none have discovered the entrance to the cave system where the treasure allegedly lies.

Crafted entirely out of amber, gold and precious stones, the Amber Room, made of numerous panels, was a masterpiece of baroque art and widely regarded as the world's most important missing art treasure.

When its 565 candles were lit it was said to 'glow a fiery gold'.  It was presented to Peter the Great in 1716 by the King of Prussia and, later, Catherine the Great commissioned a new generation of craftsmen to embellish the room.

She had moved it from the Winter Palace in St Petersburg to her new summer abode in Tsarskoye Selo, outside the city. The room was seized by marauding Nazi troops during their onslaught on Russia in 1941.  Prussian count Sommes Laubach, the Germans' 'art protection officer' and holder of a degree in art history, supervised the room's transport to Koenigsberg Castle in what was then East Prussia.

In January 1945, after air raids and a savage ground assault on the city, the room was lost, many believing it was burned to pieces in the fighting.

Koenigsberg became the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad and ever since the Amber Room has become the new El Dorado for those who choose to believe it survived; a quest that enthralled the wealthy and the poor alike.

The Maigret author Georges Simenon founded the Amber Room Club to track it down once and for all. Everyone had a different theory of what might have befallen the work.

The German official in charge of the amber shipment said the crates were in a castle that burned down in an air raid.Others think the room sank to the bottom of the Baltic Sea in a torpedoed steamer used by the Nazis, or that it was hacked up by Red Army troops and sent home like sticks of rock as souvenirs of their conquest.

A 2010 dig by a Russian treasure hunter in Kaliningrad failed to turn it up.  Now all eyes are on the wood in eastern Germany that has become the new magnet for those who never stop dreaming of gold.
