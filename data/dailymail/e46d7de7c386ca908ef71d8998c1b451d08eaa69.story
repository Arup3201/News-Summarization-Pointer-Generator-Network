Jailed: Anthony Arevalos was sentenced to eight years and eight months in 2012

A police officer who sexually assaulted women he pulled over for allegedly driving while under the influence in San Diego could get off on a technicality. 

Footage never seen before which was presented during the trial against Anthony Arevalos shows him admitting guilt while on the phone to one of his victims. 

Officer Laurie Adams asks the victim to write down everything she remembered about the alleged assault in 2011. 

But the victim's notes were never presented at the trial which convicted Arevalos of several sexual assaults. 

The attorney said: 'The defense - paid for by the police department for Officer Arevalos - is going to use (the notes) as a pretext excuse for Arevelos to be turned out of prison and go back onto the streets.'

Arevalos is expected to ask for his criminal conviction to be overturned based on the 'notes' technicality.

Arevalos was arrested in June 2011 after several women accused him of sexually assaulting them while in uniform.

He was convicted of eight felony and four misdemeanor charges involving five women, including multiple counts of sexual battery by restraint, asking for a bribe and assault and battery by a police officer.

He was sentenced in February 2012 to eight years and eight months in prison.

Seven women have filed claims against the city in connection with the Arevalos case.

It was claimed that the officer stuffed his hand down the trousers of a female motorist who he had stopped for suspected drink driving and he only let her go if she showed him her breasts.

The victim said San Diego police officer Anthony Arevalos put her through a two-hour ordeal during which he asked if her breasts were real and whether she had participated in any wet T-shirt competitions.

She told the court she had been driving along Fourth Avenue near Island Avenue in San Diego when Officer  Arevalos signalled for her to stop.

She said: 'He thought I was sitting at the stop sign too long.'

She claimed the officer, who served 18 years, repeatedly asked her to get out of the car and take a breath-test but that she had declined to do either.

Later he said he would let her go if she showed him her breasts.

The woman said she eventually lifted her top and 'flashed' officer Arevalos.

She explained how she had felt 'upset' as Arevalos stood in the open doorway of her Honda Civic and asked questions about her body.

She claimed he brushed his hand against one of her breasts as he held the breath machine close.He then put his hand down her low-rise jeans, touching her bare skin.

One alleged victim, a nursing student, said she had offered Arevalos cash to let her go and that he had declined and had asked her what else she could offer that was 'out of the books'.
