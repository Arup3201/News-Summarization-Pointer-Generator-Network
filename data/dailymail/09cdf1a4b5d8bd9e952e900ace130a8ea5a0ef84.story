Feisty: Sara Elizabeth Hellawell was said to have been offended by the senior officer's comment

A female Royal Navy Royal Navy officer killed herself after her boss called her ‘sweetheart’, an inquest heard yesterday.

Lieutenant Sara Hellawell, 26, took an overdose in her locked cabin on board HMS Edinburgh.

The ‘feisty’ marine engineer had become upset with line manager Lieutenant Commander Philip Boakes when they had a cigarette together on the deck of the Type 42 destroyer.

In a statement, Lt Cdr Boakes said: ‘We had a discussion about how some people had not showed themselves in the best light on a sun downs (a break on land) and maybe they should be cancelled.

‘Later Sara appeared to be  distressed. I asked her what was the matter and she said it was her mum. I said if she wanted to go home  it could be arranged, but she  said “No”.

‘I said “Listen, sweetheart” which I meant to be a term of endearment, but she said it was condescending.’

Lt Hellawell stormed off the deck and was found dead at 8am on June 16 after crewmate Helen Wright forced open her locked cabin door.

A post-mortem examination revealed Lt Hellawell, who grew up Ampthill, Bedfordshire, died from drug toxicity caused by amitriptyline, an anti-depressant used to treat irritable bowel syndrome, and codeine, a painkiller.

Lt Hellawell had been given a 
six-month supply of medication before HMS Edinburgh set sail on a 
seven-month deployment from Portsmouth on May 25.

The vessel was taking part in an anti-piracy operation off the coast of Angola before travelling on to the Falkland Islands.

Dunstable Coroner’s Court heard there
was nothing in Lt Hellawell’s medical history to suggest she was 
suffering from depression.

Lieutenant Commander Tony Day, who 
conducted the Royal Navy Police investigation, told the inquest: ‘No 
specific factor has been determined as the catalyst for this tragic 
event.’

But he added: ‘She placed high demands on herself and worried how she appeared to others.’

Bedfordshire coroner David Morris 
said Lt Hellawell’s grieving family believed calling her ‘sweetheart’ 
would have been ‘like a red rag to a bull’.

He said: ‘Sara was sometimes feisty and perhaps if things  didn’t quite go her way she would get angry.

‘What made her mad was calling her “sweetheart” in her own mind.

‘She was obviously a highly able officer and wanted to be respected at her level and irrespective of the fact she was a woman.’

In a statement her uncle, Peter 
Tubberdy, said that some of the officer’s personal belongings had been 
destroyed or not yet returned.

Mr Morris said he ‘shared concerns’ that some of Lt Hellawell’s bags had been removed from her cabin after her death.

‘Nothing was completely itemised, 
which is what you would expect in a criminal investigation or on shore,’
he said. ‘Lessons may be learned.’

The coroner recorded a verdict  of suicide.
