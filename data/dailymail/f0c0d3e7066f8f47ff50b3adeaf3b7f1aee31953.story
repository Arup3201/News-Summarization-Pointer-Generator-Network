Google has partnered with the Israeli government to put 5,000 images of the Dead Sea Scrolls online in full colour and high resolution.

More than six decades since the discovery of the scrolls - and thousands of years after they were written - they are now finally available for anyone with an Internet connection to see.

The digital library contains the Book of Deuteronomy, which includes the second listing of the Ten Commandments, and a portion of the first chapter of the Book of Genesis, dated to the first century BC.

Online for the first time: The Dead Sea Scrolls are now available to researchers across the globe thanks to Google which worked in partnership with Israel to upload them to an online database

Israeli officials said this is part of an attempt by the custodians of the celebrated manuscripts to make them broadly available.

They have been often criticised for allowing the artefacts to be monopolised by small circles of scholars.

'Only five conservators worldwide are authorised to handle the Dead Sea Scrolls,' said Shuka Dorfman, director of the Israel Antiquities Authority.

'Now, everyone can touch the scroll on screen around the globe.'

Ancient meets the modern: The scrolls are the work of an ascetic Jewish sect who fled Jerusalem into the desert 2,000 years ago and settled at Qumran, near the shore of the Dead Sea

Considered one of the most significant archaeological finds of the 20th century, the scrolls are thought to be the work of an ascetic Jewish sect that fled Jerusalem 2,000 years ago and settled at Qumran, near the shore of the Dead Sea.

Google says the new digital library took two years to assemble, using technology first developed by Nasa.

The multimedia website allows users to zoom in on various fragments, with translations and Google maps alongside.

Valuable: The scrolls are considered one of the most important archaeological finds of the 20th Century, and Israel had been criticised for allowing them to be monopolised by a small band of scholars

Google hopes to further expand its project. Two months ago Google launched a 'Cultural Institute,' a digital visual archive of historical events in cooperation with 17 museums and institutes around the world.

'We're working to bring important cultural and historical materials online and help preserve them for future generations,' said Yossi Matias, head of Google's Research and Development Center in Israel.

'Our partnership with the Israel Antiquities Authority is another step toward enabling users to enjoy cultural material around the world.'

Discovered between between 1946 and 1956, the Dead Sea Scrolls are a collection of 972 ancient manuscripts containing parts of what is now known as the Hebrew Bible, as well as a range of extra-biblical documents.

They were first found by shepherd Muhammed Edh-Dhib, as he searched for a stray among the limestone cliffs at Khirbet Qumran on the shores of the Dead Sea in what was then British Mandate Palestine - now the West Bank.

The story goes that, finding a a cave in the dark crevice of a steep rocky hillside, Muhammed hurled a stone into the dark interior and was startled to hear the sound of breaking pots.

Rich archaeological seam: Qumran cave 4, in which 90 per cent of the scrolls were found

Venturing inside, the young Bedouin found a mysterious collection of large clay jars, in some of which he found old scrolls, some wrapped in linen and blackened with age.

The texts are of great historical and religious significance and include the earliest known surviving copies of biblical and extra-biblical documents, as well as preserving evidence of diversity in late Second Temple Judaism.

Dated to various ranges between 408BC and 318AD, they are written in Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, and Nabataean, mostly on parchment, but with some written on papyrus and bronze.

The scrolls are traditionally divided into three groups. 'Biblical' manuscripts, which are copies of texts from the Hebrew Bible comprise 40 per cent of the haul.

Other religious manuscripts, including known documents from the Second Temple period like the books of Enoch, Jubilees, Tobit, and Sirach, that were now included in the Bible comprise 30 per cent of the identified scrolls.

The so-called 'Sectarian' manuscripts - previously unknown documents that shed light on the beliefs of Jewish groups of the time - like the Community Rule, War Scroll, Pesher on Habakkuk, and the Rule of the Blessing, make up the remaining 30 per cent.

While some of the writings have survived as nearly intact scrolls, most of the archive consists of thousands of parchment and papyrus fragments.
