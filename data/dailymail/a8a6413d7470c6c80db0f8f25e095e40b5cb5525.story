Fears that consumers are reining in their spending ahead of Christmas were fuelled yesterday after it emerged that sales volumes failed to rebound last month.

A predicted return to growth did not materialise, with official figures from the Office for National Statistics revealing flat sales volumes between October and November.

It comes after a much-worse-than-expected drop in October when retail sales volumes fell 0.8 per cent month on month.

The Confederation of British Industry said that sales for the Christmas season had been ‘below par’ as families try to make their budgets stretch as far as possible.

Excluding fuel, the ONS figures showed the total value of sales was up 2.5 per cent in November compared with a year ago, below inflation of 2.7 per cent in the same period.

The ONS said new models of tablet computers drove a 3.8 per cent boost for household goods stores, but this failed to offset a 0.1 per cent drop in food sales.

Clothes and shoes sales were also down by 0.1 per cent, with department stores also seeing sales volumes fall.

But the ONS estimated that the proportion of retail sales online increased by 1.4 per cent between October and November, with the average weekly spend in November at £711million.

Across all retailing an estimated £7.3billion was spent weekly in November, around the same as last year.

James Knightley, an analyst at ING Bank, said the headline growth figure was a disappointing outcome following a decent bounce in consumer confidence in November. He expects overall GDP to be flat in the fourth quarter.

British Retail Consortium director-general Helen Dickinson, said the figures suggested that Christmas shoppers were slow out of the blocks as pressures on budgets and the outlook left people reluctant to commit to spending early.

But she said there were signs that shopper numbers had been building at a respectable pace throughout December, especially in recent weeks.

She said: ‘With Christmas falling on a Tuesday this year, this weekend will be the critical one - I’m expecting a last-minute rush but overall in sales terms it will be neither a bumper Christmas nor a disaster.’

Meanwhile Christmas 2012 is expected be the busiest ever for online retailers in the UK, with visits to British retail websites expected to reach 126million on Boxing Day - 31 per cent up on 2011.

It would also be an increase of 14million visits from the recent record breaking Cyber Monday, and consumers are expected to spend £472.5 million as they snap up sales bargains, analysts said.

Christmas Eve and Christmas Day are also expected to be big transactional days, with consumers expected to spend £225million and £307million respectively, Experian and IMRG said.
