Struggling cell phone manufacturer Blackberry today fired its CEO and announced that the sale of  the company to a billionaire's investment group has fallen through.

The Canadian pioneer of the smartphone industry expects to make a loss of a billion dollars this year after disastrous sales of its new handsets and plans to lay off 4,500 staff.

Directors had been trying to rescue the firm with a sale to its largest shareholder Canadian investment consortium Fairfax, headed by billionaire Prem Watsa.

But Fairfax reportedly struggled to finance its $4.7bn takeover, and Blackberry now plans to replace its CEO Thorsten Heins and raise about $1 billion from institutional investors.

German-Canadian Heins had been CEO of the firm since January 2012 and oversaw the release of a new series of poorly-received handsets running the Blackberry 10 operating system.

Axed: Blackberry President and CEO Thorsten Heins, pictured, attempted to boost the Canadian firm's poor sales over the past year through a series of releases, including the Q10, pictured. But it wasn't enough.

It is another dramatic development in
the decline of the cell phone manufacturer, which has seen its devices 
eclipsed by smartphone Apple and Samsung. Shares 
of BlackBerry dropped 19 percent to $6.33 in premarket trading.

Fairfax
announced a tentative $9-a-share offer for the Waterloo, Ontario-based 
company in late September. But Reuters said on Friday that Fairfax was 
struggling to finance the $4.7 billion bid.

They never had any money beyond the Fairfax money," BGC analyst Colin Gillis said. "It's an under $5 billion market cap company with $2 billion in cash, you put up a $1 billion and you couldn't get the rest?"

Heins will be replaced temporarily by John Chen who was formerly CEO of Sybase, a database software company while the company searches for a new CEO.

BlackBerry
began trading in 1999 as an arm of Candian firm Research in Motion. The
company changed its name to BlackBerry earlier this year.

It
carried out a high profile launch of two new handsets at the start of 
the year - the much delayed Z10 touchscreen and Q10 with a qwerty 
keyboard.

A new phone, the touchscreen Z30, was unveiled  in September.

BlackBerry announced its new Z30 handset, pictured, in September before announcing losses of a billion dollars and plans to lay off 4,500 - or 40 per cent - of its workforce.

They
were designed to see it catch up with Apple, Samsung and other 
smartphone makers after falling behind in terms of new technology after 
the launch of the iPhone in 2007.

But the new handsets failed to win over critics and sales were far below what the firm was hoping for.

Its market share in the first quarter of this year was 2.9 per cent, according to analysts, down from 41 per cent in 2007.

Commenting
on the news, Nic Bulois, director of Added Value said: '  It all went 
wrong for Blackberry when they tried to go away from their core business
of providing simple, reliable and safe Business to Business mobile 
communication and ventured into the world of personal communication with
subpar technology.

'The hardware and software that ran on Blackberry devices was simply left behind.

'This
is a sad story of a brand trying to stretch too far from its core and 
losing it all – it probably could have stayed the expert of professional
mobile communication and shut down the Samsungs and Apples from this 
part of the market. Knowing your segments of the market and delivering 
to it well is what makes brands strong.'
