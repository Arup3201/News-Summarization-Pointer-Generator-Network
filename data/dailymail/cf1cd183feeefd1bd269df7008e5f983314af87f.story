Ice-cream vans can play their chimes for longer after the Government relaxed rules for operators for the first time in 31 years.

Van drivers will be allowed to play their famous songs, such as Greensleeves or Teddy Bears Picnic, for up to 12 seconds at a time - instead of the previous four.

Vendors can also chime every two minutes while driving, up from just one every three minutes.

Ice-cream van drivers can now play music every two minutes and for up to 12 seconds at a time

The announcement yesterday by the Department for Education and Rural Affairs will be seen as a victory for ice-cream van vendors, who have struggled in recent years.

But frustratingly for operators, the changes will not be implemented until after the summer, meaning they cannot capitalise during their busiest months.

The changes to the Code of Practice on Noise From Ice Cream Vans means drivers will also be able to chime once when they are parked for the first time.

However, the Government decided not to extend the hours of chiming.

Allowing music to be played until 8pm had been considered but was scrapped after strong opposition from The Noise Abatement Society.

The Government said it was a 'particularly contentious issue'.

Sales of 99s and cornets have hit a record low. 

In the past three years, traditional cones and other stick lollies have dropped by almost a third.

Rising prices have also contributed to the drop.

Only one in four people will buy ice-creams from a van. In 2010 the figure was 40 per cent, The Telegraph report.

Ice-cream tub sales have hit 333million litres but market research analyst Mintel said they expect that to fall by nine per cent by 2017.

The
 department also decided not to scrap the code altogether after a 
consultation, in which just 35 members of the public responded.

Van drivers will also not be able to chime 
within 165 feet of schools, hospitals or places of worship and no more 
than once every two hours on the same street.

The Noise Abatement Society opposed any change to the code, saying it 'establishes a balance between noise 
makers and noise sufferers'. 

However, the ice-cream van industry backed making the little-known clause of the Control of Pollutions Act 1974 less restrictive, which it is hoped will help drivers advertise themselves better. 

Since the 1950s, the number of vans on 
the road has dropped from 20,000 to just a quarter of that figure, 
according to the Nationwide Caterers Association.

The decline is partially down to a reliance on warm weather, but also ice-cream vans have been targeted by health campaigners.

The
 cost of running a van has also escalated. Buying a new vehicle can cost
 more than £60,000, while people pay £12,000 for a second hand van.

Many
 local authorities also stopped vans from operating near schools, which 
the NCA said 'hit dying businesses run by lone men in vans, while the 
supermarkets carry on selling choc ices in value packs.'

The consultation into the code came after the Government launched the Red Tape Challenge, a campaign to review all potentially unnecessary business regulation in April 2011.
