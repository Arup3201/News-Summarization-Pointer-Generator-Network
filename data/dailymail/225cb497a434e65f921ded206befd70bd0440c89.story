A paranoid schizophrenic  who stabbed a nurse to death in a low security mental hospital to avoid being sent to a non-smoking facility without wifi  will never be released, a judge has said.

Ryan Matthews, a patient at Wotton Lawn Hospital in Gloucester, stabbed 53-year-old Sharon Wall in the back with a smuggled kitchen knife in July. 

The 62-year-old had previously been admitted to Broadmoor Hospital and sectioned under the Mental Health Act after murdering two people in 1983.

On July 9, he stabbed Mrs Wall in the back with a Sainsbury's kitchen knife to the horror of other health workers and patients. 

His motive, Bristol Crown Court heard, was to avoid being moved to another facility which did not allow smoking and did not have wifi. 

Sentencing Matthews to a whole-life order today, Mr Justice Davis told the victim's family he would never be released. 

'Obviously that man will never be released. 

'Let us hope that he does not kill someone else in some other setting when he does not get his own way.'

It comes as it was revealed the 62-year-old was serving a double life sentence for the murders of two people in 1983 when he killed the nurse. 

After serving 16 years behind bars, the mental patient was admitted to the notorious high security hospital for men, Broadmoor. 

Hospital chiefs have admitted they have 'no idea' how psychiatric patient Matthews smuggled the Sainsbury's kitchen knife (pictured above) into the facility

On the morning of Mrs Hall's death, he was seen calmly smoking a cigarette in the hospital's yard. Moments later a knife had been plunged into the nurse's back. 

She was pronounced dead shortly afterwards, after beginning rounds in the hospital ward. Questions have been raised over whether the nurse should have been working alone at the time of the attack. 

'The practice was that when the night shift ended and the day shift started, what was supposed to be a pair of healthcare assistants would check the patients were in place and well,' said Richard Smith QC.

'There was some doubt as to why Sharon was going through that process on her own that day.'

Following her killer's sentencing, Detective Chief Inspector Steve Porter said authorities were still at a loss as to why he murdered the 'compassionate' nurse. 

Staff at the mental health hospital where Sharon Wall was killed have vowed to step up security after admitting they have 'no idea' how her murderer smuggled a Sainsbury's kitchen knife into the facility.

Shaun Clee, chief executive of the 2gether NHS Foundation Trust, said searches would be beefed up at the 'low secure' Montpellier Ward at Wotton Lawn Hospital. 

It comes as staff admit they still do not know how Matthews smuggled the murder weapon into the hospital.  

'What we know for a fact is we have no idea where the knife came from,' Mr Clee said. 

'Our policies previously were in line with many other organisations’ policies but we feel at this stage now, in the light of what has happened, that it would be appropriate to enhance those further.'

While it is not known how Matthews brought the weapon into the facility, he had fashioned a plastic sheaf to contain it, the court heard. 

The 62-year-old is said to have brought the blade into the facility in November 2013 - some nine months before using it to kill Mrs Hall, his lawyer said. 

'Mr Matthews has told those who care for him that he purchased the knife some months previously,' Mark Sharman said.

'He purchased it for his own personal protection in November of the previous year.'

'We interviewed Ryan Matthews over three days, seven interviews, and he never answered a single question,' he said. 

'Shortly before the attack, Matthews had made it known that he did not want to be transferred to Ty Catrin (Hospital) in Cardiff. 

'On the day of the attack it was the very same day he was going to be moved to that hospital.

'The day before he did make specific mention that he would not be going.

'And that is why I do not believe that Sharon was the targeted individual he wanted to murder.

'She just happened, unfortunately, to be the wrong person in the wrong place at the wrong time.'

He added the case had struck a chord with investigators working in the public sector. 

'With myself and the investigation team this whole incident really hits home in the heart because as public servants we all come into work in the morning, we can hopefully do the best we can do.

'But we all go home to our families and Sharon’s family don’t have Sharon coming home any more.'

Relatives and colleagues have paid tribute to the nurse, describing her as 'one in a million'.

'We would like to thank everyone for their support and such kind words that have been said about Sharon.

'She was nothing less than one in a million and to say that she will be missed is an understatement,' a family statement read. 

Meanwhile staff at the hospital expressed their shock over the sudden horror, describing Mrs Hall as 'a amazing person'. 

The woman's death shook the healthcare system, with the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt describing it as 'devastating'. 

'The events in Gloucestershire are devastating and our thoughts are with the family, friends and colleagues of the staff member involved,' he said in a statement in July. 

Wotton Lawn Hospital is an 88-bed acute mental health hospital near the centre of Gloucester which provides inpatient services for the county.

While chiefs say it is predominantly a hospital, one unit - in which Matthews was being treated - has a security fence. 

Those held in low secure units can include patients previously admitted to high or medium secure units, the chief executive of 2gether NHS Foundation Trust said.

Chilling footage of Ryan Matthews smoking a cigarette in the yard of the mental hospital where he was a patient moments before killing nurse Sharon Wall has emerged. 

Pacing across the concrete square, the 62-year-old appears relaxed on CCTV footage taken at around 7.30am. 

No more than a minute afterwards, he is believed to have plunged a Sainsbury's knife into the  53-year-old's back twice. 

After stabbing the woman, Matthews waited patiently in his room where ringing alarms brought other staff members running to the crime scene. 

Today it emerged the patient was already serving a double life sentence after murdering two people in the 1980s. 

Following a stint in prison, he was admitted to Broadmoor hospital for men before being released and admitted to Wotton Lawn in Gloucester. 

A judge told the psychiatric patient today he would never be free again.

It helps such patients 'move down through medium secure and low secure before being discharged,' said Shaun Clee.  

'Depending on the individual’s presented circumstances, there will be times when people have leave from the unit, and that can be both escorted leave and unescorted leave.' 

On the day of Mrs Wall's death, staff were preparing to escort Matthews to a different facility in Wales. 

Speaking after today's sentencing, Mr Clee said: 'Our internal investigation has concluded that this attack could not have been predicted or prevented.

'Our first priority following Sharon's death was to make sure we understood how the tragic incident occurred and what changes need to be made to our policies and procedures.

'We launched a serious incident review within hours of the event occurring and an internal investigation followed shortly after.

'During the investigation, we have focused a great deal on how the weapon used in this crime was on the Montpellier Unit.

'Neither we, nor the police, know how Mr Matthews gained access to a knife and unfortunately we may never find that out.

'Robust control and monitoring of sharps within the low secure unit exist and all the unit's sharps are properly accounted for.'

Paying tribute to the nurse, he added: 'Sharon was a highly compassionate, well-respected and dedicated colleague.

'Everyone who knew her speaks about her warmth, caring nature and good sense of humour and colleagues across the trust feel her loss every day.'
