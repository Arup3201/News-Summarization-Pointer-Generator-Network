Michael Carrick has suffered another injury blow after being ruled out of England’s Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia with a groin problem.

Carrick’s withdrawal from the squad  after a scan confirmed the injury will also be a major disappointment for Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal.

The midfielder, who was in line to play against Slovenia at Wembley on Saturday, faces an anxious wait to see whether he will recover in time for United’s game against Arsenal on November 22.

Carrick trained for 20 minutes at St George’s Park on Wednesday before limping off with the injury. He was sent for a scan in the afternoon which ruled him out of Saturday’s clash and the friendly against Scotland at Celtic Park on Tuesday.

Carrick later tweeted: '2 steps forward 1 step back Gutted to miss the next 2 @england games, hopefully no more than that though. Missed too much already!!' 

Tottenham winger Andros Townsend will be assessed  after failing to train for a second successive day because of an ankle injury.

The England forward was dragged off at half-time during Spurs’ 2-1 defeat at White Hart Lane against Stoke City on Sunday.

Carrick was making a comeback for England after going over a year without playing for Roy Hodgson's side 

Hodgson has given Townsend another 24 hours to recover before making a decision on whether he should remain with the squad for the next five days.

Carrick was given permission by Van Gaal to join Hodgson’s squad after making his first start of the season against Crystal Palace at Old Trafford last Saturday.

Instead the United manager will assess his player when he returns to Carrington on Thursday for a scan. England medical staff believe it is only a minor tear.

Twenty-four hours before his withdrawal, Carrick had spoken of his pride at earning a recall to the national squad. 

Asked if he considered retirement following his World Cup snub, he replied: ‘I am only 33 so hopefully I have got a few more years left. It was never something that crossed my mind. I am enjoying things at the moment and I feel good.’

United’s next game is against Arsenal and Van Gaal has a crippling injury list. Defenders Marcos Rojo, Rafael da Silva, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans are all struggling with problems and striker Radamel Falcao continues to be plagued by knee trouble.
