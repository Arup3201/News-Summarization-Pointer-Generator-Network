A primary school teaching assistant plunged 330ft to her death while on a walking holiday in the French Alps.

Felicity Ward - who was known as Fizz - was a teaching assistant for children with special needs in Tavistock, Devon.

The 52-year-old is believed to have been hiking on her own in the Valjouffrey valley in the Isere region of eastern France when she fell.

Tragedy: Teaching assistant Felicity Ward, 52, plunged 300ft to her death while hiking alone in the French Alps

Felicity Ward was hiking in the Valjouffrey valley, France, when she fell

It is thought she tumbled off a steep path leading up to the Col De Vaurze and plunged around 330 feet.

There
were no emergency calls and her body was only discovered when other 
walkers found her earlier this month. It appears 'she was walking out 
alone'.

Mrs Ward worked at the St Peter's Church of England junior school in Tavistock, west Devon.

A school statement read: 'We regret to inform you that Mrs Fizz Ward has died tragically during a walking holiday in France.

'Although we are awaiting more information from the relevant authorities, if anyone wishes to send cards of condolence please send them care of the school and we will ensure they are forwarded to her family.

'Fizz was a much respected and valued member of staff who will be sorely missed. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family at this sad time.'

Sue Weatherhead, deputy head of Tavistock Church Schools Federation, said: 'She was a teaching assistant and very dear colleague.

'She was highly professional, very enthusiastic and she will be very hard shoes to fill.'

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said they were made aware of her death 10 days ago.
