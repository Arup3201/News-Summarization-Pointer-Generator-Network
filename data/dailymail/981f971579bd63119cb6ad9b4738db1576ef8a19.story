Prostate cancer drugs taken by thousands of men have been linked to fatal heart attacks in a study.

US academics found the treatment trebled the likelihood of death among men with existing heart problems.

However, cancer experts pointed out that the benefits of the life-extending treatment normally outweigh any possible risks.

Some 41,700 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer in Britain each year, with most cases in patients over the age of 50.

This is an age when they are also at increased risk of heart disease.

It is estimated that more than 16,000 men in this country receive hormone treatment called androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which was the focus of the Harvard University study.

Researchers looked at 5,077 men with prostate cancer who were treated from 1997 to 2006, and particularly the risks of ADT drugs, which work by reducing the levels of certain hormones that fuel tumour growth. They found that in healthy men, or those with raised blood pressure or cholesterol, there was no link to deaths from heart attacks.

But in men who had already suffered a heart attack or heart failure, which would weaken the heart muscle, the risk was three times higher.

The researchers theorised that changes in hormone levels could also affect the heart.

They concluded that the treatment should be avoided in patients with existing heart problems who have tumours which are slow growing and lower risk.

Lead researcher Dr Paul Nguyen, whose study is published in the journal BJU International, said: ‘While androgen deprivation therapy can be a life-saving drug for men with prostate cancer and significantly increase the cure rates when used with radiation for aggressive disease, this study also raises the possibility that a small sub-group of men who have significant heart disease could experience increased cardiac death.

Men who sleep with more than one woman in their lifetime are less likely to develop prostate cancer, research shows.

Those who had 20 or more female sexual partners over their lives reduced their risk by 28 per cent compared to those with one.

And virgins were twice as likely to be diagnosed than sexually experienced men.

The study involved 3,208 men who had answered questions about their lifestyle and sex lives. The Canadian researchers said that a higher frequency of sexual encounters could help prevent the cancer.

Lead researcher Professor Marie-Elise Parent, from the University of Montreal, explained: ‘It is possible that having many female sexual partners results in a higher frequency of ejaculations, whose protective effect against prostate cancer has been previously observed in cohort studies. We now know that the number and type of partners must be taken into account to better understand the causes of prostate cancer.’

Other experts have speculated that having lots of sex could reduce the concentration of cancer-causing substances in the semen.

Despite the findings, published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Professor Parent cautioned against men using the findings to be promiscuous.

 

‘I would still say that for men with significant heart problems, we should try to avoid ADT when it is not necessary – such as for men with low-risk disease or men receiving ADT only to shrink the prostate prior to radiation. However, for men with high-risk disease, in whom the prostate cancer benefits of ADT likely outweigh any potential cardiac harms, ADT should be given even if they have heart problems, but the patient should be followed closely by a cardiologist to ensure that he is being carefully watched and optimised from a cardiac perspective.’

Dr Iain Frame, director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, said: ‘It is well known that men over 50 are at increased risk of developing prostate cancer. If also overweight, this same group are also at increased risk of heart disease and Type 2 diabetes.

‘We therefore welcome research which looks at taking these other diseases into account when considering prostate cancer treatments.

‘However, although this study suggests a potential link between ADT hormone therapy and increased risk of death in men with an existing heart problem, it does show that the risks are in fact relatively small and that the benefits of taking this for treatment outweigh any possible harmful effects.

‘We would not therefore wish to see men currently on this form of therapy stop their treatment as a result of these findings.’
