It is a renovator's delight. The sign, that is. Not the house.

A helpful citizen has taken issue with a real estate sign riddled with errors outside a property for sale in Melbourne, Victoria. 

The 'For Sale' sign was first spotted by Felicity Humann in Balwyn, east of Melbourne's CBD, but the identity of the well-meaning vandal is unknown.

'My grandfather saw it during a walk around the neighbourhood and came home to tell us all we had to go and see it,' Humann told Daily Mail Australia. 

Armed with a red marker, the anonymous grammar fanatic clearly couldn't help themselves, adding their own corrections to the poorly-worded copy.

'A renovator's delight': An anonymous grammar fanatic took to a poorly worded 'For Sale' sign with lavish, using red pen to amend errors and leave an honest appraisal

Despite the helpful corrections, the original copy is still on the realestate.com.au website

Real estate agent Lucy Ren has her face, name and number on the sign but insists she didn't write it, nor did she see the sign before it was 'edited'. She says the buyer and seller were both 'very, very happy' 

'Perfect located one of the famous street in Balwyn, school zone of Balwyn high second colloge,' the first line of the poster read jarringly. 

'It is only walking minutes to shopping mall, 109 tram and the Eastern Freeway,” the listing reads.

'The house features with classical style, stable construction; offers 3 generous size bed rooms with built in wardrobes, plus study space. Two townhouse permit!' 

Red pen was used to remove unnecessary letters and add in crucial words to try and form a more legible sentence.

The wannabe teacher gave a harsh appraisal of the real estate agents' effort, giving them a dismal grade of D+.

The sign for the house was first spotted by student Felicity Humann who took a photo and put it online

The agents were also implored to take more care with their proof-reading.

'Well presented work, girls,' the wordsmith wrote, admitting that they were impressed by the use of photos and glossy finish.

'Next time, a little more care with proof-reading please.'

Agent Lucy Ren has her name and face on the sign but she insists she did not write the copy.

'The buyer and the seller were both very, very happy with the sale,' Ms Ren told Daily Mail Australia.

'The red pen was only on the sign for a couple of hours. I came by at 6pm and cleaned it off. But somebody must have already taken a photo.'

'The house features with classical style, stable construction; offers 3 generous size bed rooms with built in wardrobes, plus study space. Two townhouse permit!'

'I have many, many years of experience and I am the best seller in the company. I did not write that sign. I did not see it.' 

The property was sold on January 20 but the house description remains on the website, without the helpful corrections provided on the sign.

Felicity Humann, a 29-year-old student, says she and her grandfather were both in stitches when they saw the sign.  

She has a knack for grammar as she is an aspiring English teacher herself. 

She points out that the owner of the red pen was less thorough than she would have liked.

'It was a bit harsh because the person correcting it missed out on a whole lot of errors anyway,' she laughed.

'It's a case of pot, kettle, black!'

'It is only walking minutes to shopping mall, 109tram and the Eastern Freeway,” the listing reads
