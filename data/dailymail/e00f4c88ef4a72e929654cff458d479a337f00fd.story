Cult Dutch lingerie label Marlies Dekkers is the go-to purveyor of power underwear and we’re not talking Spanx.  

Previously a trade secret for those in-the-know, her under the radar status is rapidly diminishing with a newly opened four week pop-up in Harrods following her concession launch at Selfridges last year.

The brand's eponymous founder Dekkers makes borderline bondage underwear for women who mean business and know exactly what they want – both in the bedroom and out of it.

And yes that means Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Victoria Beckham, Mila Kunis and Dita von Teese.

In fact, Dekkers is one of three preferred suppliers for Gaga’s tour outfits, most recently dressing the queen of pop for her New York Born This Way promo and a sultry performance on this side of the pond at last summer’s Radio One Big Weekend concert. 

But there's more to come and Dekkers is currently working on a secret Gaga collaboration set to be revealed later this year: 'It's a secret,' she says, 'you'll see it in a few months.'

According to Dekkers, Lady Gaga is 'a woman who follow her dreams and dares to grow and be'.'Gaga is a very talented lady and come a long way and that's exactly what the brand stands for.'

The designer, whose mantra is 'I am as beautiful, as sensual, as 
desirous as I believe myself to be,' set up her company from her bedroom
nearly 20 years ago and her signature cage-like Dame de Paris bras (above left) now 
enjoy cult status.

She became frustrated with old-fashioned lingerie thinking, 'there's something for my mother, something for my grandma, but not for me.'

Other celebrity fans of Dekkers' include Nicki Minaj and Christina Aguilera and her sexy lingerie even made a cameo appearence in Duran Duran's Girl Panic video featuring supermodels Cindy Crawford, Helena Christensen, Eva Herzigova, Noami Campbell and Yasmin Le Bon.
