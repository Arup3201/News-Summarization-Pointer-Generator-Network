Nathan Cleverly says he will beat Tony Bellew in the latter rounds when they face each other again on Saturday, and he wants a title fight with cruiserweight champion Marco Huck next.

Cleverly and Bellew will meet in Liverpool in a rematch of their WBO light-heavyweight title fight - a bout the Welshman won on points. 

And 27-year-old, who would be happy to travel to Germany to go up against Huck, claims his next opponent should retire when he is through with him.

Nathan Cleverly, celebrating his win back in 2011, says he will beat Tony Bellew again on Saturday

The fighter from Liverpool will be in his hometown to welcome Cleverly for a huge rematch

'I think the fight will be similar to the first, but more explosive. I believe my stronger fitness will wear him down, and I'll get the late stoppage,' Cleverly told 666BET.

'If I get a repeat win against him, this time at cruiserweight, he should just retire and admit that he's lost to the better man. He's put himself up on a pedestal but I'm going to beat him again.'

As well as referencing Huck, Cleverly was also asked about Sergey Kovalev, who knocked Cleverly out last year. 

He added: 'I would jump at the chance to fight for a second world title in a second division, that is my goal. I'd have no problem going to Germany to fight Marco Huck.

'With Kovalev, I've said for a long time that he's a different breed. He's an exceptional fighter and a great boxer. I'd love the opportunity to have a rematch against him and avenge the only defeat I've had in my career. 

'It would have to be at a catch weight, I couldn't do light heavy now. It would have to be somewhere between light heavy and cruiser.'
