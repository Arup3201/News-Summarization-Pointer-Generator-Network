After quietly and privately marrying several weeks ago, Felicity Blunt exchanged vows with The Hunger Games star, Stanely Tucci, for a second time over the weekend dressed in a custom-designed Nanette Lepore wedding gown.

The bride's famous 
actress sister Emily, was her bridesmaid, along with youngest sister Suzie Blunt and friend Amy Dixon, who all wore near-matching white dresses also designed by Ms Lepore.

The designer, who was also in attendance, joined a star-studded guest list which included Mr Tucci's fellow Devil Wears Prada 
co-star Meryl Streep, Patricia Clarkson, Julianne Moore, Colin Firth and
 Kenneth Cole.

Boardwalk Empire star Steve Buscemi acted as best man for the wedding, held at London's Middle
 Temple Hall, and then the restaurant L’Anima.

According to Women's Wear Daily, it was Emily who introduced her 
sister, a literary agent, to Mr Tucci several years after they worked 
together on The Devil Wears Prada.

And as a surprise, the newlyweds were presented with a wedding cake made out of wheels of cheese.

Earlier in the week on Friday, Mr Tucci 
was seen beaming standing outside pre-wedding celebrations at Shoreditch
 House in East London with a drink in hand, with Emily and her husband 
John Krazinski.

'Stanley is very happy with her,' a source told Us Weekly at the time.

'Emily loved Stanley on the set of Devil, and just thought they would hit it off, so she set them up,' the source added.

This is Mr Tucci’s second marriage. His first wife, Kate, with whom he had three children, died from breast cancer in 2009.
