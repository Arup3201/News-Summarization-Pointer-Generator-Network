Bayern Munich midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger has been caught on video singing rather a rude song about rival club Borussia Dortmund.

The German World Cup-winning hero was recorded singing 'BVB, sons of b******s' at what seemed to be a rather rowdy shindig.

It should only serve to intensify the rivalry between the clubs, who have shared the last five Bundesliga titles between them.

Rivals: He is a club legend for Bundesliga opposition Bayern Munich

Schweinsteiger has been granted extended leave following his World Cup exertions but will head to New York with the rest of the squad for Bayern Munich's summer tour at the end of July.

Bayern will stage a public practice session at the Red Bull Arena before taking on Mexican side Chivas on 30 July and finishing with a game against a team of MLS All-Stars on 6 August.

SchweinsteigerÂ  will be joined by fellow World Cup winners including Manuel Neuer, Philipp Lahm and Mario Gotze in the States - while star midfielders Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery and new signing Robert Lewandowski are also expected to feature.
