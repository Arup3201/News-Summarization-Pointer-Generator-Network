Speaking about her new collection, which is designed to be worn from day to night, the plus-size designer told MailOnline: ‘I love a splash of colour and I love seeing girls embrace their curves in the summer sun.

'I’ve brought out this collection to give plus-size women some confidence by combining flattering silhouettes with summer trends. GC loves her fashion!’

Gemma says her high summer range is ideal for all your summer events and she's injected a bit of catwalk fashion into the plus-size pieces to give them some seasonal flair.

‘I added a bit of sparkle into my new pieces as I think everyone should shine this season. I love my new Dallas piece - it’s a bit glitzy, a bit Gatsby and I absolutely love it’, she added.

As well as designing her range, Gemma has been spending time with her jailbird ex-boyfriend Alex Moss, following his release from prison.

The
 Only Way Is Essex star reunited with her former flame last week 
after he completed a five-and-a-half year jail sentence for conspiring to supply cocaine in 2008.

The
 on-off couple were reported to be dating again two months ago, with reports suggesting Moss 
headed straight to Gemma's house on being released last week.

The TOWIE star was keen to reunite with 
her 'gangster' ex-boyfriend, as the pair could previously only enjoy short stints 
together while Alex was on day release.

A spokesperson for Gemma told MailOnline the pair had known each other for many years.

They said: 'They are just good friends and enjoy spending time together.'

The duo first started dating over a 
decade ago but the blonde beauty hinted that things weren't over between
 them in April when she described Alex in her autobiography 
'Basically...: My Life as a Real Essex Girl' as 'a bit of a gangster but
 with a big heart.'

Reports on The Mirror suggested that, now Alex is free, the pair have started things back up. 

A
 source told the newspaper: 'Gemma is open-minded, and though she knows 
he's not the greatest guy, she believes people deserve second chances.

'She's very understanding. Hence why it was Gemma he turned to first when he was released.'
