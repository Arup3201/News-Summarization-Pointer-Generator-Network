Double trouble: Twins (from front) Jack and Joshua Davis, Charlotte and Emily Kaur, Adam and Jack Richards, Jake and James Murphy, Catherine and Elizabeth Ormian are all in the same year at school

Teachers and pupils are seeing double at a school which has a record-breaking 20 sets of twins.

De Aston School in Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, has beaten the British record, with 12 sets more than previous record holder, and is now applying to Guinness World Records to confirm if it has smashed international records.

Incredibly, six sets of identical twins started at the school in September with the newest intake of year seven pupils.

Teachers at the 907-pupil school are staggered by the phenomenon and said there must be ‘something in the water’ in town.

The chances of 20 sets of twins attending the same school are 400,000 to one and having six in the same year group is 175,000 to one. 

Elizabeth Humphrey, English teacher and year seven tutor, said: ‘I have two sets of identical twins in my tutor group alone and when I first found out, I thought it was ridiculous.

‘The number of twins we have in the school is surprising.

‘A couple of the girls wear their hair differently but other than that it's really tricky to tell them apart.’

Victoria Davies, head of year seven, said: ‘We are looking to get little name badges for their blazer lapels so we can tell who is who.

‘In my 12 years at the school I have never known any more than one set of twins in a year group.

‘I have managed to tell the difference between four of the six but I'm still working on the other two.’

Headteacher Ellenor Beighton said: ‘All of our twins are delightful young people who we treat as individuals and we're very happy to have them here.

‘There's something in the water around Market Rasen, that's for sure.’

The twins have also found it confusing, with their classmates and teachers having troubles telling them apart.

Confusing classmates: De Aston School in Market Rasen, Lincolnshire has broken the record for the most sets of twins at one school, with 20 sets at their school, eight more than the next biggest

Charlotte and Laura Wilson, 17, are both studying maths and physics at the sixth form.

Charlotte said: ‘The teachers can usually tell us apart but other people get it wrong all the time so after sixth form we want to try and be separate so we're looking at different universities.’

The previous record holder for the most twins at one school was Netherthorpe School, near Chesterfield in Derbyshire, who had eight sets in the same year group.

400,000 to one: Teachers cannot believe how many twins are in attendance, with one saying there must be 'something in the water.' The odds of 20 sets attending the same school is 400,000 to one

According to the Guinness World Records website, the most sets of twins in the same academic year at one school are 16 sets. 

The record is held by three schools, grade nine at Valley Southwoods Freshman High School in Iowa, the graduating class at the Maine South High School in Illinois and grade 10 at Staples High School in Connecticut.

Maine South High School also had three sets of triplets in the graduating class.
