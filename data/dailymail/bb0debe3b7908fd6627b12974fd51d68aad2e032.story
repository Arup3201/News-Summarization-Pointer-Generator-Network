For decades, the promise of sunny 
weather, a family-friendly lifestyle and affordable property has driven 
hundreds of thousands of Britons to make the move to Australia.   

But it seems, for many, their dream life Down Under has turned into something of a disappointment.

A record number of Britons left  
Australia last year, many bored with  their ex-pat life and keen to 
spend  more time with family in the UK, research has revealed.

Britons celebrate Christmas Day on Bondi beach in Sydney. But for many the Australian dream has faded - the attractions that led them to start a new life on the far side of the world just aren't enough to keep them there

Nearly 107,000 people arrived there from the UK between 2005 and 2010. 

But more than 30,000 Britons left over
the same period. And last year a record of more than 7,000 Britons 
departed Australia permanently.

Researchers Mary Holmes, a senior 
lecturer in sociology at Australia’s Flinders University, and Roger 
Burrows, of the University of York, studied why so many ‘ping-pong Poms’
are returning home.

They said: ‘A better life is not about good jobs, sunshine or bigger houses.

‘What is most important is  feeling close to family and feeling “at home”.’

The researchers added that ‘pursuing this dream life can result in disappointment’.

Spacious: Australian properties tend to be large and offer good value for money when compared with British homes

Cramped: British houses tend to be smaller and older... and cost a lot more

Exotic land: Researchers agreed that some Britons who returned home could fairly be described as 'whinging Poms'

A number of returning Britons left 
because of ‘boredom’ in Australia, the pair found, complaining of 
stressful daily routines such as three-hour commutes on hot, crowded 
trains. 

Dr Holmes and Professor Burrows said 
that while some who left could be described as ‘whingeing Poms’, 
complaining about the heat and insects, most had better reasons, with 
family being a common one. Many wanted their children born in Australia 
to get to know grandparents and other relatives in the UK, even if it 
meant sacrificing a better quality of life.

And for others, not ‘feeling at home’ in Australia was a crucial factor in their decision to leave, the research showed.

One Briton who had left Australia said: ‘Coming back has been a bit like slipping into an old pair of shoes.’   

Another told the researchers that since returning to her old home town she had ‘come alive again’ despite having to move into a smaller house, drive a smaller car and having less money.   

She said: ‘I love walking everywhere, wrapping up warm, politeness, greenery, quality TV.’

However the researchers did note  that some who returned kept their options open by obtaining Australian citizenship before doing so.

One Briton told them: ‘That way, when your duty to your children and grandparents is finally done you are free to go back to make your home in Australia.’
