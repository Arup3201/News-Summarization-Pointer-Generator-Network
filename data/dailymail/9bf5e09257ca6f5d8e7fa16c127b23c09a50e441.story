A benefits cheat who scammed more than £13,000 after claiming he couldn't walk more than 230 feet unaided was caught out after being filmed playing football.

Paul Frazer was rumbled after he was caught having a kick about - despite claiming that he could not walk unaided for more than a few metres.

Frazer, from Askam, Cumbria, had been legitimately claiming disability living allowance since July 2000 but failed to notify the Department of Work and Pensions when his condition improved.

Paul Frazer, pictured, was caught on camera playing football despite claiming he could not walk more than 230 feet unaided

In April 2006, Frazer, pictured, said he wasn't able to walk distances greater than 985 feet without discomfort, and in 2007 he said he could not walk more than 230 feet unaided

In April 2006 he said he wasn't able to walk distances greater than 985 feet without discomfort, and in 2007 he said he could not walk more than 230 feet unaided.

Claire Thomas, prosecuting, said: ‘Over two months, a surveillance operation observed Frazer on 36 occasions.

‘He was observed walking at a moderate pace, unaided, taking his daughter to school, being picked up by a van and playing football.

‘He was interviewed on July 17 last year and denied that his condition had improved.

‘He said that he had not played football but when the evidence was put to him he accepted he had been playing football regularly.

‘He also accepted working with his brother, who runs a central heating business.’

After being shown evidence of himself playing football, Frazer admitted he had been playing football regularly and working with his brother, who runs a central heating business

Claire Thomas, prosecuting, said: 'Over two months, a surveillance operation observed Frazer on 36 occasions. He was observed walking at a moderate pace, unaided, taking his daughter to school, being picked up by a van and playing football'

Miss Thomas told the court Frazer, 46, had falsely claimed a total of £13,316.40.

Andrew Scott, defending, said: ‘His doctor informed him the best thing would be to do something and get more exercise, he accepts there was a change in himself and he felt better.

‘He had been a hard-working, industrious man but suffered a nervous breakdown in 1998.’

Claire Thomas, prosecuting, added: 'He was interviewed on July 17 last year and denied that his condition had improved. He said that he had not played football but when the evidence was put to him he accepted he had been playing football regularly'

Recorder Mr John Benson QC, who handed Frazer a three-month suspended prison sentence and an £80 statutory surcharge at Barrow Crown Court, said: ‘You have claimed in the order of £13,000.

‘When surveillance of your activities was undertaken you were seen playing football; working with your brother who runs a business, providing assistance as a second man.

‘The false claim is wholly inexcusable and unforgivable.’

Roy Paul, the Department of Work and Pensions fraud manager in the North West, said: ‘It is our duty to ensure that benefit payments go to those who really need them and we are committed to cracking down on those who play the system. Our welfare reforms are vital to close the gaps that cheats take advantage of.

‘It is unfair that some people get support when they do not have a disability, while many people depend on the benefits system to provide a safety net.

‘Deliberately not informing us of a change in your condition that may affect your claim is a crime.’
