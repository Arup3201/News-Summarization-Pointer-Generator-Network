The lengths Taliban are prepared to 
go to to gain access to coalition forces shown as two militants dressed in women's clothing are arrested

U.S. military commanders in Afghanistan have assigned 'guardian angels' - troops who watch over their comrades even as they sleep - as part of a series of increased security measures to protect troops against possible rogue attacks.

The added protections are part of a directive issued in recent weeks by Marine General John Allen, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, to guard against insider threats.

And they come in the wake of a spike in attacks on U.S. and coalition forces by Afghans, including the point-blank shooting deaths of two U.S. advisers in Afghanistan's Ministry of Interior.

The lengths the Taliban are prepared to 
go to in order to gain access to coalition forces was illustrated 
yesterday when local police arrested seven men dressed in women's clothing
 in Mehterlam, Laghman province, east of Kabul.

Tensions have increased in recent 
weeks, most noticeably after Staff Sergeant Robert Bales wandered off a 
U.S. military base in southern Afghanistan and allegedly killed eight 
Afghan adults and nine children.

Some of the security changes have been subtle, others not so much.

In
 several Afghan ministries, Americans are now allowed to carry weapons. 
And they have been instructed to rearrange their office desks there to 
face the door, so they can see who is coming in, said a senior military 
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

While
 General Allen did not detail the new measures in a briefing earlier 
this week, he acknowledged that changes had been made.

He
 said: 'We have taken steps necessary on our side to protect ourselves 
with respect to, in fact, sleeping arrangements, internal defences 
associated with those small bases in which we operate.'

He added that now someone is 'always over-watching our forces'.

The
 security measures came after the U.S. military mistakenly burned Qurans
 and other religious materials in February, triggering anti-American 
demonstrations and riots.

That same month, two U.S. military 
advisers were gunned down at their desks in one of the most heavily 
guarded ministry buildings in Kabul.

As
 a result of the shootings, more than 300 advisers were pulled out of 
the Afghan ministries. So far, several dozen have returned, but many 
will not go back until additional security measures are put in place by 
the Afghans.

That would include better vetting procedures, background checks and physical security measures at the ministries.

The military official also said some advisers may not return, since commanders have determined that some may no longer be needed in the jobs.

The military official said Allen issued the directive 'to get every single troop in the war zone to read it and think' - and to emphasise that troops should be aware of their surroundings as they go about their jobs.

U.S. commanders and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said the killings do not represent a trend, and that less than half of the killings have been by Afghans associated with the Taliban.

Instead, General Allen said these types of attacks come with fighting an insurgency and happened in Iraq and Vietnam. The enemy, he said, will do what it can to disrupt efforts to train and grow a nation's indigenous security force.

Still, the recent spike in Afghans gunning down troops they are serving alongside reflects increased tensions between the two countries just as the coalition escalates efforts to train Afghans to take over their own security so that most Nato forces can leave by the end of 2014.

Officials insist the killings have not hampered the U.S. mission in Afghanistan.

But they come at a time when new, small advisory teams are heading into Afghanistan to beef up the training program, requiring them to work closely with Afghan military units.

So far this year, 16 Nato service members have been shot and killed by Afghan soldiers and policemen or militants disguised in their uniforms. That equals 18 per cent of the 84 foreign troops killed this year in Afghanistan.

Of the approximately 80 Nato service members killed since 2007 by Afghan security forces, more than 75 per cent were in the past two years.

In two separate incidents on Monday, Afghan security forces shot and killed one American and two British troops.

In one incident, two British service members were killed by an Afghan soldier in front of the main gate of a joint civilian-military base in southern Afghanistan, the coalition said.

And in the second, a U.S. service member was shot and killed at a checkpoint in Paktika province in eastern Afghanistan by a man who was believed to be a member of a village-level fighting force the U.S. is fostering in hopes of countering the Taliban insurgency.

According to the military official, the so-called guardian angels provide an extra layer of security, watching over the troops as they sleep, when they are exercising, and going about their day.

General Allen noted that the Afghans have also taken some similar steps to provide guards for their own forces.

The Afghans have also inserted their own intelligence officers into their units to help try and ferret out possible insurgents or rogue soldiers.

Since the ministry shooting, the Afghans have taken a number of steps to increase building security in the ministries and to improve the vetting of their workers.

General Allen said: 'They are helping the troops to understand how to recognise radicalisation or the emergence of extremism in some of those, in individuals who may in fact be suspect.'

He noted that there have also been some arrests by Afghan forces when they identified possible attackers within their ranks.
