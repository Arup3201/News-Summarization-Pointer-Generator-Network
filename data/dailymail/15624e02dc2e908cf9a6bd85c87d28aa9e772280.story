One Australian reporter has discovered first-hand the perils of chasing down a difficult interview when she was attacked with a cooler full of water on Thursday, leaving her soaked from head to toe.

Nine News' Alex Bernhardt was at a Gold Coast man's home in Queensland's south east after police allegedly found a hand grenade at the address during a raid earlier in the day.

Bernhardt arrived at the residence with her camera crew as the man was filling up his cooler. But when she asked about the hand grenade, the man made it very clear that visitors weren't welcome.

She told Daily Mail Australia that it was her last day on the job, admitting: 'It was a way for me to go out with a splash'.

The man told Bernhardt he didn't want to be recorded, the man warned that he was going to hurl the water-filled cooler at the reporter

The man offered an explanation for his actions, confessing: 'I smoke a little dope'

After he told Bernhardt he didn't want to be recorded, the man warned that he was going to hurl the water-filled esky at the reporter.

While she responded in disbelief, Bernhardt was soaked before she even had a chance to run for cover.

The man later offered an explanation for his actions, confessing: 'I smoke a little dope'.

It was certainly a day to remember for Bernhardt as it was her last day at Nine Gold Coast News.

Bernhardt, who will be starting at her new post in Brisbane next week, says the man went back to refill the esky and yelled: 'Do you want to go for round two?'

'I guess it was a way for me to go out with a splash,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'I didn't think the video would take off like this.

'We were just having a good laugh about it back at the office and thought it'll be funny to put it up online.'

Bernhardt, who will be starting at her new post in Brisbane next week, says the man went back to refill the esky and yelled:Â 'Do you want to go for round two?'

The man was charged with weapon and drug offences.

Thursday was Bernhardt's last day at Nine Gold Coast News. She will be moving onto a new post at Brisbane
