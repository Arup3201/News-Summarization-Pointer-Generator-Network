A retired New York radio personality has been charged in a sting operation accused of trying to transport a seven-year-old girl to the U.S. Virgin Islands for sex.

'Age 6 is the perfect time to start her being loved that way,' Herman allegedly wrote to the undercover cop.

'I find girls that age incredibly sexy, soft and their innocence is also a huge turn on for me.'

According to the criminal complaint: 'Herman promised that he would not hurt "Lexi" though he might have to be "forceful" with her. Herman suggest that they could give "Lexi" some alcohol to relax her'.

The U.S. attorney's office confirmed Herman had worked at FM radio station WNEW, where he was a pioneering rock 'n' roll disc jockey for 25 years from 1972 to 1998.

The station started as a free-form rock station and gradually evolved into the ultimate home of rock radio in New York.

During his years as a DJ, Herman interviewed the likes ofÂ  Mick Jagger, Bruce Springsteen, David Bowie, and Pete Townshend.

Herman was scheduled to make an initial court appearance Friday in St Croix.

Prosecutors said they had not been notified as of Thursday afternoon whether Herman had a lawyer. No phone listing was found for him in Airmont.

Herman allegedly tried, in multiple 
telephone and online conversations, to arrange illegal sexual encounters
 with the child in New York and Bergen County, until indicating he 
wanted to fly the pair to St Croix so he could engage in sexual activity
 with the child there, prosecutors said.

Herman
 purchased airline tickets September 30 for the woman and her child to 
fly from LaGuardia airport to St Croix, according to prosecutors.

He
 arrived at the airport Thursday to pick up the woman and child, 
according to the U.S. attorney's office, but was instead met by special 
agents of U.S. Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement, who placed him under arrest.

Herman
 is charged with a count of attempting to transport a minor in 
interstate commerce with the intent that the minor engage in illegal 
sexual activity.

If convicted, the charge can carry up to life in prison and a maximum $250,000 fine.
