An inventive pet owner has created the world's goldfish walking device - because he was worried his pet was bored.

Mike Warren-Madden spent weeks designing his unique 'Aquatic Perambulator' as a way to help pet fish Malcolm have a more exciting life.

Former sheet metal worker Mr Warren-Madden, 60, came up with the plan around seven years ago.

Sadly, his beloved goldfish has since died.

But the fish lived to the grand old age of 11 thanks, Mr Warren-Madden says, to his adventurous lifestyle - which included trips to the pub and walks around town.

Despite Malcolm passing away he hopes his pioneering legacy will now see an entrepreneur come forward to invest in the invention.

Mr Warren-Madden, from Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, said: 'We had some right looks around town, we stopped traffic, but everyone has got into it now. It's not every day you see someone taking a fish for a walk.

'If a fish is in a bowl on a shelf swimming in circles it must get bored. I decided it would be fun to take it out with me down the pub.

'People have said to me the fish couldn't see what was going on, but I always said "how do you know?"'

The contraption even allows fish owners to share a drink at the local with their pet, as Mr Warren-Madden enjoyed to do with the late Malcolm

He said: 'If a fish is in a bowl on a shelf swimming in circles it must get bored. I decided it would be fun to take it out with me down the pub'

'Malcolm lived to almost 12-years-old, I think he was getting something out of it.'

The Aquatic Perambulator - which is now a Mark III - stands around four-foot tall and is made from laser-cut mild steel.

Mr Warren-Madden, who lives with wife Shirley, 58, said: 'My wife has learned to live with me, I have been tinkering around with this idea for around seven years.

'With the first designs I didn't take into account how heavy water is so I have modified it over the years.

'I've added better elastic to take the shock out of the water and I hope to get better wheels.

'Because of my background as a sheet metal worker I have been able to build this at little cost - but for someone else it would cost hundreds to make.

'I think I'd like someone to come forward and help me motorise it perhaps with a remote control.'
