Tory chairman Grant Shapps last night defended the party’s by-election candidate after she said she was considering sending her son to private school.

And he warned Nick Clegg against trying to exploit the comments by Maria Hutchings for political gain.

Mrs Hutchings, Tory candidate in the Eastleigh by-election, became embroiled in controversy after saying she may put her son William into private education.

The outspoken mother of four said: ‘William is very gifted, which gives us another interesting challenge in finding the right sort of education for him – impossible in the state system. He wants to be a cardio-respiratory surgeon.’

The Lib Dems and Labour seized on her remarks as evidence that she was out of touch with voters.

Labour leader Ed Miliband wrote on Twitter: ‘Comments from Maria Hutchings totally wrong. An insult to every state school in the country. And all of their pupils.’

But Mr Shapps yesterday warned rivals against making a political issue out of what was a personal choice.

He pointed out that Mrs Hutchings, her husband and three of her children attended state schools.

‘I really believe that as politicians we have to be responsible and not try to drag children into by-elections,’ he said.

‘Every parent wants the best for their child, and whether that’s Nick Clegg or Ed Miliband or Maria Hutchings or myself, I mean, I think it’s perfectly reasonable to look for the best option for your children.

‘But she’s got four children and two or three of them are in the state system. I think that rather illustrates that she believes in it.’

Grant Shapps said children should not be 'dragged into by-elections' and said Hutchings just wanted best for her child

Tory sources accused the Lib Dems of dirty tricks, pointing out that their leader, Mr Clegg, went to the leading public school Westminster and is  considering sending his eldest son to a private school.

Mr Clegg, who has spoken about the ‘corrosive’ influence of private schools on society, said he did not want his own son’s education to become a ‘political football’.

But a Lib Dem source insisted the criticism of Mrs Hutchings was legitimate. ‘As a parent she is perfectly entitled to send her children to a school of her choice,’ he said.

‘What she should not do is say it is impossible to get a decent state education in the area.’

The by-election in the seat vacated by disgraced ex-Lib Dem minister Chris Huhne is on February 28.
