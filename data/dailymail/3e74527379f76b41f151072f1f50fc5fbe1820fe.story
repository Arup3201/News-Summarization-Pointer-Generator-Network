Should Liverpool sell Luis Suarez to Barcelona?

Barcelona are poised to formally open the bidding for Luis Suarez this week.

Club intermediaries believe they already have an accord in principle with the player and his representatives but Barca must now match Liverpool's £80m valuation.

Although Liverpool have an interest in Alexis Sanchez, the Chile star is keen to stay one more year at Barcelona which may also frustrate other suitors Arsenal, Manchester United and Juventus.

Real Madrid maintain an interest in Suarez but they have opened preliminary talks with Monaco over a deal for Radamel Falcao.

Liverpool are pressing ahead with deals for Southampton's Adam Lallana, Benfica's Lazar Markovic and Lille's Divock Origi. Although Tottenham have made a late move to sign the Belgian striker he is expected to sign for Liverpool for £9.8m.

Liverpool are unperturbed by Real Madrid's interest with Raheem Sterling. The England international signed a long-term contract 18 months ago which incorporates annual increments.

Former Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish, meanwhile, believes Liverpool should not wash their hands of Suarez in the wake of his latest biting controversy.

Suarez, who was initially brought to Anfield in 2011 by Dalglish for £22.8m, has been banned from any football-related activity by FIFA for four months after he appeared to bite Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini in last week's World Cup Group D clash.

Suarez finally apologised to Chiellini on Monday, with some, including Gary Lineker, insisting he was forced to say sorry by his agent to push forward a move to Barcelona.

Although the ban has the potential to rule out last season's PFA and FWA player of the year for a significant chunk of Liverpool's 2014-15 campaign, Dalglish believes they will stick by their man.

'I think you will find that Liverpool will not turn their back on Suarez, whatever the ban FIFA have decided he must serve. Of course it will be a heavy blow if the club has to do without him for the opening months of the season,' he said in his Daily Mirror column.

'That will seem harsh, particularly as he has been in someone else's care for the last few weeks and Liverpool have had no control over him.'

It is the third time the 27-year-old has been involved in incidents of biting.

While at Ajax, the Dutch FA banned him for seven matches for biting PSV Eindhoven midfielder Otman Bakkal and last April the FA gave him a 10-game suspension for nibbling on Branislav Ivanovic's arm.

Liverpool stood by Suarez after the Ivanovic incident - just like they did after he was accused, and later found guilty, of racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra in 2011 during Dalglish's second spell managing the club.

Dalglish, who came out strongly to defend Suarez in the press at the time, feels that when a club buys a player 'he becomes your responsibility'.

The controversy has not deterred new Barcelona boss Luis Enrique, however, with the Catalan giants ready to tempt Liverpool with a big-money offer.
