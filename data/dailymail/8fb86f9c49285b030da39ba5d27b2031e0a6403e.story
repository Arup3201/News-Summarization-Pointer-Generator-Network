Faye Stone, 54, outside Chelmsford Crown Court today. She waited a week after she found her lodger's body before she told police about the death

A landlady left her dead lodger lying in his room for more than a week because she wanted to 'tidy up' before reporting his death.

Faye Stone, 54, waited a week before telling police about the death of Terry Brett, 60, after she discovered him dead on his bed in the house they shared in Elsenham, Essex, last year.

She said that her chronic fatigue syndrome rendered her unable to tidy up his belongings, which she said she needed to do before officers could enter the property.

Stone, who pleaded guilty to preventing the lawful 
burial of Mr Brett, was given a six month jail 
sentence suspended for two years with 12 months supervision at Chelmsford Crown Court today.

The 54-year-old, from Essex, was understood to have had 'some form of relationship' with Mr Brett, who moved in to her house two months before his death in June last year.

The court heard that Stone was a friend of Mr Brett for several years before he contacted her about becoming her lodger.

Stone's Counsel, Peter Barlex, told the court: 'He was out 
of work, short of money and had health problems.

'He moved in during 
April and she had helped him with his shopping and given him a lift to 
the station.'

He explained that when Stone returned from visiting her mother, she entered Mr Brett's bedroom and found his body on the bed. The court heard how he died of a drug overdose.

The exact date of Mr Brett's death is not known.

Mr Barlex said that she was 'distressed' because her chronic fatigue syndrome meant 'she couldn't tidy up for the authorities to gain access'.

He said: 'She remained in that property and is 
remorseful. She knows she should have contacted the police much earlier,
 it was a reaction to finding his corpse in his bedroom.'

Sentencing, Judge Patricia 
Lynch QC said: 'This is a serious matter and a very unpleasant offence but you didn't really understand how serious the offence was and how relatives, if he had them, felt about him lying there several days more than he could have.'

Referring to Stone's explanation of chronic fatigue, Judge Lynch continued: 'On the face of it strikes as fanciful. But I can give it some credibility because of her condition.

The court heard how Stone returned from visiting her mother to find Mr Brett dead on his bed in the home they shared in Elsenham, Essex, pictured. She blamed the delay in her reporting on her chronic fatigue syndrome

'We're talking about a week at the absolute most and there are no aggravating features.'

Stone, who the court heard was of previous good character, had admitted preventing the lawful and decent burial of Mr Brett's body between 13 and 21 June last year.

Prosecutor Richard Stevens said Mr Brett had been there 'a week or so' before she reported his death to the police.

He continued: 'She contacted police about midnight on 21 June and later said she had done so at night because she didn't want the neighbours to know exactly what was going on.'
