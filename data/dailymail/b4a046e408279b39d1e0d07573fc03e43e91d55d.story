Day after day this week Nigel Farage’s Ukip has endured accusations of fakery and racism... and yesterday even more gaffes continued to surface.

It emerged that a ‘British builder’ featuring in a poster complaining about cheap foreign labour was in fact an Irish actor.

And there was further embarrassment after a senior Ukip party manager posted an advertisement in his local newspaper suggesting Muslims take multiple wives so they could get extra benefits.

Ukip faced embarrassment after it emerged the builder in its latest anti-immigration advert was an actor, Dave O'Rourke, who is from Ireland

Never rains then it pours: Ukip leader Nigel Farage admitted something had gone wrong with the party's vetting system

Still smiling: Nigel Farage is faring well in the polls ahead of the European elections next month

A week that started with Ukip looking 
forward to unveiling its £1.5million European election poster campaign 
was ending last night with the party firmly on the back foot.

It
 has spent days defending itself against a barrage of complaints that 
its posters were ‘racist’ and that a ‘voter’ featured in the ads was in 
fact a Farage aide, Lizzy Vaid.

Then
 yesterday it emerged that one of the poster stars, who appeared to be a
 British builder ‘hit hard by unlimited cheap labour’, was actually an 
Irish actor, Dave O’Rourke.

In
 his profile on the acting website StarNow, Mr O’Rourke said he could 
speak in several accents including Irish, South African, English, 
Scottish and German.

The launch of the anti-immigration poster campaign on Tuesday was supposed to mark the start of a new, more professional era for Ukip.

The award-winning Edinburgh-based advertising agency Family - which has worked for the BBC, Debenhams and the Conservatives - helped produce the campaign funded by ex-Tory donor Paul Sykes.

But critics branded the slogans 'racist', even before revelations about the people in the poster and TV adverts plunged the party into turmoil.

Builder in TV advert posts racist tweetsZimbabwean
 decorator Andre Lampitt posed in a builder's hard hat to complain that 
‘lads from Eastern Europe’ were undercutting him.

But on Twitter he 
posted a series of offensive comments,  claiming Ed Miliband is ‘not 
British’, condemned Islam as ‘evil’, branding the Prophet Mohammed a 
paedophile and saying he wanted Africans to ‘kill themselves off’.

UKIP RESPONSE: Nigel Farage: 'Repellent was the word we used, and I will 
stick with that. We have put in place a vetting procedure and something 
has gone wrong.'

Lizzy Vaid appears in a full-page 
photograph as a voter from Devon, but is actually Ukip’s events manager 
and an assistant to the party leader.

UKIP RESPONSE: Nigel 
Farage: 'The fact that Lizzie Laid is half-Indian and works for us is as
 far as we are concerned a non-issue. Most parties use actors. We use 
Ukippers.'

Eye-catching poster shows a builder 
begging on the street with the message: 'EU policy at work. British 
workers are hit hard by unlimited cheap labour.'

But he is Dave O'Rourke, an actor from Ireland who moved to Britain 10 years ago.

UKIP RESPONSE: Director of communications Patrick O'Flynn: 'The vast 
majority of people used in political poster campaigns are actors. It is 
totally standard practice.'

He 
said: ‘I’m originally from Dublin, Living in the UK 10 years. I’m 
currently acting full time and looking to build my portfolio.’

His CV includes a part as 'a troubled 
youth with psychotic tendencies' in Saltwater, a 2001 Irish drama with 
In Bruges and Harry Potter star Brendan Gleeson.

He has since taken part in two drama courses in Edinburgh and played an HMRC officer in the 2008 drama Adulthood.

People from Ireland are able to move freely to the UK under the immigration rules which Mr Farage is campaigning against.

To add to the embarrassment, only this week Mr Farage boasted: 'Most parties use actors. We use Ukippers.'

It followed the revelation that 'Lizzy 
Vaid from Devon' who featured in the party's manifesto is actually 
Ukip's events manager based in London.

Another
 row blew up yesterday after David Challice, a leading party activist in
 the South West, placed an advert in his local newspaper for his 
discount store business which offered a ‘money spinner’ ‘for ‘any 
cash-strapped Moslem [sic] reading this’.

It
 went on to suggest that men could take a ‘harem’ of wives to get an 
extra £33.65 a week in  benefits from the Department for Work and 
Pensions for each of them.

He also made sexist comments suggesting women should not go out to work, that they were  natural home makers.

Mr
 Challice said he had discussed this issue with his wife Hilary and that
 ‘since the snow came back all she’s done is look through the window. If
 it gets any worse I’ll have to let her back in again’.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage yesterday admitted 'something went wrong' with the party's vetting system.

As
 Ukip struggled to get its election campaign back on track, Conservative
 MP Bob Neill said of the poster using an Irish actor to depict a 
British builder: ‘Here is another example of Ukip being cynical and not 
being straight with the British voters.’

Ukip
 director of communications Patrick O’Flynn said: ‘The vast majority of 
people used in political poster campaigns are actors. It is nonsense for
 the Conservative Party to try and depict this as anything out of the 
ordinary.’

The party 
defended Mr Challice’s comments in his advert, saying there were ‘quite 
legitimate concerns about the interaction of the benefits system with 
men who have multiple wives’.

A
 spokesman added: ‘Mr Challice’s remarks about women in the workplace 
and his wife were intended as a joke and indeed were understood as such.
 He does not seriously believe women should not work. Given that his 
wife works in the same office as he does, it would be curious if he 
did.’

Mr Challice also made derogatory remarks about Greeks and Turks in a book he published.

On another front, Mr Farage last night faced accusations that he was changing his tune on having his expenses audited.

The Ukip leader had earlier suggested that he would be happy to have a probe into his allowances as an MEP.

But
 in an interview with the Guardian last night, he denied he had ever 
suggested it. ‘I said if every other British MEP wants to, then I would.
 I am not going to be one out of 73 that is held up as an example of all
 that is wrong with the European Union.’
