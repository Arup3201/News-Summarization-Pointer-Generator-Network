A family has spoken of their shock after spotting an animal more at home in the rainforests of Brazil than their garden in an English market town.

Anna Shearer first noticed the unusual creature – thought to be a South American coati -  being chased by the family dogs round their garden in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, this afternoon.

At first, she thought her pets - a Springer Spaniel and Jack Russel - were playing with another dog.

But then she realised the animal was a little more unusual.

Anna Shearer was surprised to see the creature in her back garden on the banks of the Thames in Marlow, Buckinghamshire

She first noticed it when her dogs began going 'mental', chasing the animal around the garden

'I thought they were playing with a baby bear,' she said. 'They were going mental - I think they probably would have tried to eat it if it was any smaller.'

Anna, 23, called for help from her father Dave, and the two rushed out into the garden - just in time for the bear-like creature to disappear up the tree.

'It shot up a really tall tree,' she said.

They quickly called for reinforcements - and nearby animal charity Tiggy Winkles sent out a volunteer to help try to catch the 'bear'.

But even with the help of a net, they were unable to catch the animal - which fled towards the banks of the Thames.  

'They said it was probably someone's pet bear which had escaped,' Anna said. 'It is definitely not from around here.'

The RSPCA confirmed it had also had a call about the animal a couple of days ago - described by a concerned resident as either a badger or a bear.

But they were unable to find it. 

She thought the animal may have been a small bear - but it seems it may have been a South American coati

A closer inspection of the video seems to reveal it is not a bear at all, but a South American coati, a small animal weighing between two and 7.2kg, and measuring just 33 to 44 inches.

Half of their length is made up by their tail - but, in this case, the tail appears to have been severely shortened.

This breed of coati was first discovered in Brazil, and lives in the jungles and rainforests of South America.

If right, it is not the first time the coati has been spotted in Marlow: two years ago, a group of ramblers spotted an animal later confirmed as a coati in a wood near the market town.

On that occasion, it was thought the coati had escaped from a sanctuary on an estate at Fawley Hill, Henley on Thames, owned by Lady Judy McAlpine, of the McAlpine construction empire.

The creature could be a South American coati - a small, racoon-like animal

 It wouldn't be the first time a coati was in Marlow - one was spotted in 2013
