QPR director of football Les Ferdinand has admitted that appointing Chris Ramsey as Harry Redknapp's successor until the end of the season was a 'gamble' by the Premier League club. 

Ramsey took permanent charge of QPR in February following Redknapp's departure but the relegation-threatened club have lost six out of seven games since the full-time appointment which leaves them four points adrift of safety.

But Ferdinand has backed the QPR boss after admitting any manager taking charge of the Loftus Road outfit would find it a challenge.

'No regrets at all because I know what a great coach he is,' Ferdinand told Sky Sports. 

'It's a gamble, any manager coming in would have been a gamble.

'There's no guarantees that anyone would have kept us in the division or anyone would have done any better than Chris Ramsey’s doing at the moment, so I’ve got no regrets whatsoever.

'Most people say when a manager comes in you need to give him time to build his own team – Chris hasn't had that. He's come in and done us a favour but he's doing a job with someone else's hand.'
