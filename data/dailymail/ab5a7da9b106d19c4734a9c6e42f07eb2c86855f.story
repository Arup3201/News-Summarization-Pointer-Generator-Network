It's a scheme that saw Waitrose face a middle-class backlash over complaints that its stores were being invaded by less well-off shoppers.

And now the retailer has decided to introduce a stricter policy on its free tea or coffee option for myWaitrose loyalty card holders when drinking at its in-store cafés, as a retail expert claimed it could cost as much as £150,000 a week to provide the perk.

It has trialled a scheme at six stores in Bedford, Hitchin, Exeter, Weston-super-Mare, Nailsea and Chester whereby free drinks are only available at the café till to customers buying food as well.

This could be anything from a cake to a sandwich or even a full meal - but at these stores you can still get a no-strings-attached free drink from the self-service machine.

Changes: From February 9 all members will be asked to buy food if enjoying a free drink in a Waitrose café

And from February 9 cardholders will be asked to buy food if enjoying their drink at all of its cafés.

The offer - introduced in 2011 - has allowed anybody with a card to pick up a free Americano, cappuccino, latte, tea, mocha or espresso every day - even if they do not spend anything in store.

In some stores, including at Bloomsbury in central London, the free coffee cups are stored at the tills - although customers with a myWaitrose card do not have to make a purchase to receive one. 

Today The Times newspaper reported that customers do need a shopping receipt at the Bloomsbury store to get their free tea or coffee, but this was denied by Waitrose.

The popularity of the myWaitrose card offer has made the retailer the second largest provider of coffee in the UK, with its stores shifting one million cups a week.

Popular: The loyalty scheme has five million members, with Waitrose giving out an estimated one million free teas or coffees every week. Shoppers can also get a free newspaper when spending more than £5

Phil Dorrell, director of the retail consultancy Retail Remedy, told MailOnline: ‘It was a very good commercial marketing ploy that has over the last few years become a little bit abused.

‘It costs them money to do it and they’ve got to ask themselves is it worth it? [Northern supermarket chain] Booths do exactly the same thing. Does it really benefit the actual Waitrose customer?

‘The execution of it at store level has been a little poor and allowed people to come in, get a free coffee and then not really shop - and a lot of these people would tend to do that on a frequent basis.

‘That was not the intent of the card. The intent was a thank you from Waitrose. I think Waitrose when they did it were under pressure from all the other supermarkets doing a price war.

‘They wanted to make a statement to their customers saying “we’re different too”. It’s just a sort of expression of the fact that they were different.’

The loyalty scheme has five million members, with Waitrose giving out an estimated one million free teas or coffees every week. Shoppers with the card can also get a free newspaper when spending more than £5.

Mr Dorrell said he estimated that the ingredients of the tea or coffee available at Waitrose would come in at between 12p and 15p, meaning that it could be costing the supermarket as much as £150,000 a week to provide the perk.

But he added: ‘Some of that will be extremely beneficial to them as they’re getting new customers, but we don’t how much of that is being abused. That’s the unknown quantity.' 

A statement on the Waitrose website said: ‘From February 9 we will be asking myWaitrose members who wish to enjoy their free tea or coffee in one of our cafés to also purchase a treat - such as a sandwich, cake, biscuit or piece of fruit.

‘This change will enable us to continue to offer our customers the enjoyable service they expect.’

And a Waitrose spokesman told MailOnline today: ‘A complimentary tea or coffee while shopping with us is one of our ways of saying thank you to our customers.

‘Most people who have their myWaitrose free drink in the café understand that they should buy something from the café to have with their tea or coffee, and so we are simply confirming that.

‘MyWaitrose members who would like to drink their free tea or coffee in the café will also need to buy something, in the café such as a sandwich, cake or piece of fruit to go with their drink. Customers can still buy a drink in the café too.

‘Of course myWaitrose customers can still get their free hot drink from the self-serve machines whilst they are shopping with us.’

Last September Waitrose reported operating profit  fell 9.4 per cent to £145million because of - among other factors - 'substantial' investment in stores, its website and the myWaitrose scheme.

In December 2013 the Mail reported how regular Waitrose customers claimed the supermarket's offer of free cups of tea and coffee in all its stores was attracting the wrong type of clientele.

Long-standing customers said at the time that the move was encouraging large numbers of myWaitrose cardholders who have no intention of shopping and merely get in the way. 

Waitrose boss Mark Price said he believed that shoppers want instant rewards, such as free coffee, rather than the 'meaningless' benefits offered by conventional supermarket loyalty cards.

And in March 2014 the Mail told how a woman had to go to the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton after drinking a free coffee from a Waitrose store that contained cleaning fluid.

Paramedics were called to the branch of the supermarket in Lewes, East Sussex, and advised her to visit a burns unit, although she is thought to have attended a local A&E instead.

Waitrose apologised for the 'unfortunate incident' and sent her a £25 voucher. A spokesman said: ‘We have confirmed that the cleaning fluid does not have any long term impact on health.'

The next month MailOnline revealed how a second customer had fallen ill after drinking a free coffee from Waitrose that was contaminated with cleaning fluid.

Father-of-two David Sack, 49, was in a rush when he grabbed a free cappuccino at the branch in West Byfleet, Surrey, but felt sick after drinking it.

The supermarket chain apologised to Mr Sack, and offered him £25 compensation, but he returned the money because the amount was 'insulting' - and was then presented with £100.

A spokesman for Waitrose said at the time: ‘Mr Sack should not have been able to pour a drink while the machine was being rinsed - and we have taken action to prevent it happening again.'
