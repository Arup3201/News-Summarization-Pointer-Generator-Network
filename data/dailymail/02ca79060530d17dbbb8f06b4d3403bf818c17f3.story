UFC's undefeated Bantamweight Champion 'Rowdy' Ronda Rousey has dismissed claims that mixed martial arts is too dangerous a sport or that it degrades women. 

The 28-year-old told Good Morning America, 'There are so many ridiculous arguments that MMA is somehow anti-woman. Fighting's not a man's thing, it's a human thing. To say it's anti-woman, is I think, an anti-feminist statement. In the UFC, I mean, I'm the biggest draw in the sport and I'm a woman!' 

Rousey, who won a bronze medal for Judo at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, also feels that MMA is unfairly stigmatized.

 The 28-year-old fighter believes that MMA is an unfairly stigmatized sport that does plenty to help women

She said, 'I'm a two-time Olympian, Olympic medalist, and when I was doing judo, the exact same things I really apply in MMA, I was celebrated as an American hero. Somehow, when I do it for money, I'm a barbarian?' 

Rousey also commented on how MMA has helped to improve the way women are treated in popular culture. 

In terms of UFC directly working towards that end, Rousey explained, 'Just this last weekend, women were introduced walking to the Octagon not as women's bantamweights, they were just bantamweights. They were just introduced as fighters, and that's it. It's the first sport in the world to do that.'

Rousey has recently signed a new long-term contract with UFC.
