Adulterers are texting their way into trouble over Christmas - with divorce lawyers saying the festive season is one of the most dangerous times for getting caught out.

Family get togethers mean cheating partners often rely on their mobile phones to stay in contact with their lovers.

But that increases the risk of illicit relationships being found out through phones left carelessly lying around, or partners becoming suspicious of texts or calls.

Ayesha Vardag, named the UK’s top divorce lawyer by the Law Society, said ‘Christmas text message bustings’ have become increasingly common due to constant use of mobile phones - even during family occasions.

‘People are suddenly holed up with their family but those in any other relationship are very conscious of being shut out.

‘They are going off up the garden to try to make calls and sending messages and then the phone ends up lying around the house.’

Miss Vardag, who has acted in splits including the £100 million divorce of German heiress Katrin Radmacher, added that she first noticed the growth of ‘text message bustings’ at Christmas last year.

Patricia Robinson, a senior associate in family law at Manchester-based Pannone Solicitors, said: ‘If someone is texting a lover during Christmas lunch with their partner and family then it could be said that they are asking for trouble.

‘In my experience, though, it is unusual for evidence of adultery to suddenly come to light.

‘It is more often the case that a husband or wife will become suspicious and then investigate further by checking their partner’s mobile phone and social media pages.

‘It is true that the notion something may not be right does sometimes originate as a result of Christmas parties, particularly those involving work colleagues.’

Philanderers’ problems are compounded by alcohol and heightened emotions, according to Voula Grand, a psychologist and novelist whose book Honor’s Shadow charts marital betrayal.

‘It is a perfect storm – everybody has had a few drinks, everybody is talking more, you haven’t got time alone when you could communicate and the temptation is too great,’ she said.

‘You have got his intense family time but you have got two families in effect.

‘You can imagine the pull – you would want to make some contact over that period and I think people would take greater risks.

‘The other side of it is that families are home and all together, you haven’t got that time apart where it is easier for you to make contact with your lover.’
