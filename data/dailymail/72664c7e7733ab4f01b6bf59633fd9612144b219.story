From cute animals to Benedict Cumberbatch and even the Queen, it seems that virtually everyone has managed to get in on the photobombing craze.

And now it seems even the spirits of the dead are making an appearance after two teenagers spotted what seems to be a ghostly girl in the background of a Snapchat selfie.

Bethany Harvey, from Northern Ireland, took a picture of herself, her baby nephew and her sister to show friends, but later noticed what seemed to be a little girl's torso in the background.

Closer inspection revealed what looked like a young girl wearing a purple dress sitting down with her hands folded neatly in her lap.

Miss Harvey told the Daily Mirror: 'I was taking a picture of my nephew and I, but my sister jumped into the background so I captioned the picture "photo bombed!"

'A friend of mine came to my house that night and pointed out what looks to be a woman with her hands folded on her knees in the background, baring in mind the picture was taken facing the living room door.

'Although we can't see the face of the figure the rest of it is as clear as day. There was nobody else in the living room at the time, except for the ghost girl in the purple dress.'

She added that she is now terrified of going into her living room in the dark in case she catches another glimpse of the spectre. 

It is not the first time that a lost soul has apparently wandered into a Snapchat photograph.

Kayley Atkinson, 23, and Victoria Greeves, 22, from Newcastle, were on a night out in the town centre when they decided to take a snap to send to friends.

They were having drinks in the Slug and Lettuce on Quayside, which they said was virtually empty, when the image was captured.

But when they looked closer at the image, they saw what appeared to be the tormented face of a ghostly woman dressed in Victorian clothing between their heads.

Miss Greeves, who works as a nurse, said: ‘We took the picture in the bar as we usually would, we are both fans of a selfie.

'I uploaded the picture to Snapchat and thought nothing more of it. But later that night Kayley rang me in a panic and told me to have a closer look. 

'She said there was a figure in the background, and I am quite sceptical about things like that so I just laughed at the time.

Kayley Atkinson, 23, and Victoria Greeves, 22, from Newcastle, also appeared to have captured a picture of another lost soul while on a night out (pictured between their heads)

Kim Davison and Jessie Lu, who were with their three children when they took the image, noticed the ghostly apparition in their photograph, before discovering a girl drowned in the swimming hole 100 years ago

‘But when I looked back at the picture I could not believe what I was seeing. It is terrifying. 

'I couldn't look at the picture at the beginning as I was too freaked out. It is so clear, and it looks like what can only be described as a Victorian woman, laughing behind us.’ 

Local authority worker Miss Atkinson added: ‘The bar was dead when we went in. It was only when I got home later on that I noticed the photo.

'I couldn't believe it. I was absolutely terrified and Victoria was so scared that she deleted the photo off her phone. A lot of people have said we must have photoshopped the picture.

'I can't blame them, but neither of us would even know how to do that. I didn't believe in ghosts at all before, but I'm not so sure any more.’

The image also comes just days after an Australian family apparently photographed the spirit of a young girl who drowned in a swimming hole while they were taking a dip there.

Kim Davison and Jessie Lu say they were with their three children when they took the image, but another child can be seen in the centre of the picture.

After the image attracted a lot of attention online the pair did some research and found that a young girl drowned in the same spot 100 years ago.
