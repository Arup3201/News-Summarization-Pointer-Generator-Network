TV presenter Piers Morgan last night called arch-enemy Jeremy Clarkson a chicken after the Top Gear man refused to face him in a boxing ring.

The chat show host challenged Clarkson to a punch-up to settle their 14-year-long feud.

Morgan, 48, said that the match would be in aid of Help For Heroes with the loser paying £100,000 to the Forces' charity.

When Morgan was the editor of a tabloid newspaper he published pictures of Clarkson, 53, getting friendly with a female work colleague - after Clarkson had denied any wrongdoing.

Four years later, Clarkson  punched Morgan at an awards ceremony in London.

Recently, Clarkson teased Morgan on Twitter and in a newspaper after his CNN show Piers Morgan Live was by CNN.

However Morgan tweeted: ‘He talks a good game, let's see if @JeremyClarkson has the b***s to walk it too. £100k charity fight – yes or no, Fatboy?’

Clarkson refused to rise to the bait: ‘I'm not going to box Piers Morgan. I'm too busy’ later adding ‘Leave me alone. I’ve got a job to do.’

Morgan responded: ‘Cluck, cluck cluck.’

The battle between Piers Morgan and Jeremy Clarkson began in November 2000.

Morgan was the editor of the Daily Mirror when he was sent a set of paparazzi photos showing Clarkson in an embrace with TV producer Elaine Bedell. Morgan rang Clarkson and offered a deal if Clarkson co-operated.

Clarkson claimed Bedell was just a friend and, according to Morgan, added: ‘I’m not physically capable of having an affair. You can ask my wife.’ Morgan published the pictures anyway. Clarkson was not happy.

In May 2002, at a wedding Clarkson and his wife Frances lay into Morgan for publishing the photos. Morgan apologised.

Five months later, more photographs appeared of Clarkson and Bedell together and Clarkson again insisted they were innocent.

A year later, Morgan and Clarkson were on the last flight of Concorde. Despite the fact that Clarkson told other passengers that Morgan ‘is a little ****’ and he was going to ‘punch his lights out,’ BA put Clarkson in the seat directly in front of Morgan.

As Clarkson took his seat he said, ‘oh, ******* hell, I’ve got a **** behind me.’ ‘And I’ve got one in front of me, too,’ Morgan replied. Morgan taunted Clarkson: ‘Come on big man, show me what you’ve got.’ Clarkson then tipped a glass of water over Morgan.

In March 2004, they both attended the British Press Awards. Clarkson swung at Morgan and hit his temple and forehead.

The next day, Morgan announced: ‘I think it’s fair to say he was a little inebriated. I’ve frankly taken worse batterings from my three-year-old son.’ Clarkson admitted: ‘He’s won really. This is just one in a long line of clashes. We’ll have to kiss and make up.’

Clarkson, however, did the opposite. The following month, he appeared on Michael Parkinson’s TV show, and said: ‘I don’t get on with Piers Morgan, so I punched him,’ adding, ‘Every woman I meet asks me, “Why did you hit him?” And every man asks, “Where did you hit him?”’

In December 2012 in the wake of the shooting of 20 pupils and six staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, Morgan called for a gun ban, leading pro-gun Americans to call for him to be deported from the U.S.

On Christmas Eve Clarkson tweeted: ‘Americans. It took us 40 years to get rid of Piers Morgan. Please don’t send him back.’

Clarkson also tweeted repeatedly when Morgan had his nightly show dropped by CNN, then used one of his newspaper columns to launch a long attack on the host.

If he had hoped to offend Morgan, he failed. 'Dear old @JeremyClarkson warned I wouldn't like what he's written about me tomorrow. I just read it, and LOVED IT! Quite fabulously b*tchy,' he Tweeted.
