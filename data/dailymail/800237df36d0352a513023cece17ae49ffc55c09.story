Manchester United's new home shirt appears to have leaked online - with new images doing the rounds claiming to show the new Chevrolet-sponsored jersey.

The Reds were set to unveil the latest edition of their iconic red shirt on Monday but fans may have already seen the final design.

The Chevrolet logo - appearing on the shirt as part of a record £53million deal - looms large across the middle, while the Reds have gone with a black and white striped detail on the shirt's collar and sleeves.

Authentic: The new images claim to show the Reds new shirt, complete with close-up shots

The back of the neck includes a small detail of a black devil from United's crest but looks to be otherwise plain except for the names of the players - including new signings Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera.

An official teaser video was released yesterday but fans don't appear to have been teased much - if the new images prove to be the shirts to be worn by Wayne Rooney and co next season.

And the shirt isn't the only thing new at Old Trafford: alongside their two new signings and new manager Louis van Gaal, the 'Theatre of Dreams' will also be sporting a revamped turf.

United published an image of green grass of home on Instagram - and it looks perfectly set for Van Gaal's expansive style to flourish as the Reds look to move back up the table after a disappointing campaign last time round.
