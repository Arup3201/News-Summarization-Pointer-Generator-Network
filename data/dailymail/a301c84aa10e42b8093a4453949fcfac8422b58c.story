A 24-year-old California woman has died from a suspected drug or alcohol overdose at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival last weekend.

Kimchi Truong, of Oakland, was rushed to John F. Kennedy Memorial Hospital early Sunday morning after suffering 'an unknown injury,' according to information from Riverside County Coroner Stanley Sniff.

The young festival-goer was later transferred to Desert Regional Hospital, where she was pronounced dead at around 2.30pm Thursday.

Police say Troung had sought medical treatment at around 2am last Sunday at a festival tent and later collapsed at a taxi pickup stand, the station KTLA reported.

The official cause of death is still to be determined, but the medical examiner has attributed Troung's passing to overindulgence in drugs or alcoholic beverages.

Investigators are still waiting for autopsy and toxicology reports to make a final determination. 

According to her LinkedIn page, Troung was a student at California State University-East Bay.

Concert promoter Goldenvoice issued a statement calling Troung's death 'an unfortunate but isolated incident.'

Indio police spokesman Ben Guitron told The Desert Sun that Coachella attendees have died in the past after returning to their hotel rooms.

The California State University-East Bay student reportedly collapsed at a taxi stand not long after seeking medical help

In 2008, a 21-year-old La Mesa resident passed away after being found unresponsive at a private camping area unaffiliated with the official Coachella site.

Coachella is an annual two-weekend music and arts festival held at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California.

It is one of the largest and most profitable music festivals in the U.S. In 2010, it drew about 225,000 people per weekend, among them celebrities and socialites of every stripe.

This year's lineup of VIP guests included Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez, models Alessandra Ambrosio and Nina Dobrev, Leonardo DiCaprio and many others.
