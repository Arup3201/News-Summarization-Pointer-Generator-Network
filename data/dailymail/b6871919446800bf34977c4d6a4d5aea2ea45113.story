Christine Bleakley with fiance Frank Lampard, both are set for move to New York

She already has two homes, one in London and another in Northern Ireland and now Christine Bleakley looks to be adding another.

The TV presenter has revealed she has been hunting for a property in New York with her fiance Frank Lampard following the end of her four year ‘golden handshake’ deal with ITV.

While Miss Bleakley, 35, still has several projects in the pipeline with the ITV, the end of her £4million deal frees her up to work for other broadcasters – even opening up the possibility of a job on American television.

Miss Bleakley has been busy searching for a US base for Lampard, 36, ahead of his move next March.

Lampard, the Premier League’s top scoring midfielder of all-time with 171 goals, has signed with New York City after seeing out his contract at Chelsea.

He will join the American side when the season begins in March but will spend the next six months on loan to Manchester City.

Speaking about the move the former Dancing on Ice presenter told The New York Post’s gossip section Page Six: ‘I’m easygoing. I’ll try to make this work for him [Lampard] but don’t want to live off him.

'Back home, I’m on Ireland’s channel and do ITV documentaries — a music special, an Ireland and Britain tour. Still doing that until his season starts. With all this to-ing-and-fro-ing, no idea what my career here will be.’

She told the American newspaper that she enjoys spending time in New York, adding: ‘I’m from Northern Ireland, living in London. I love it here. Love Bloomingdale’s. Love this walking city, although I don’t know always where I’m heading. And with firefighters, police, Belfast’s Madison Square Garden workers and friends who run a bar near Wall Street, I love the Irish connection.

‘[We are] stuck in a hotel now, we’re looking for an apartment.

‘I’ve been [to New York] before, but you need a feel for the place. Don’t want to get it wrong. People are helping but, basically, just Frank and I are looking. Ideal is a view. Four bedrooms. He has two little girls we want to look out for.’

Miss Bleakley made the move from the BBC to ITV in 2010, leaving her job presenting The One Show. However, her place at the broadcaster has changed numerous times as she has flitted between different shows.

After being dropped from breakfast show Daybreak in 2011, the former Strictly Come Dancing contestant went on to front Dancing On Ice alongside Philip Schofield. However, the show came to an end earlier this year.

Her solo outing, Off The Beaten Track was pegged as a competitor to BBC’s Countryfile but was axed after a year, only managing to pull in 4million viewers.

Lampard has two daughters – Luna, eight, and Isla, seven – with his former fiancée, Spanish model Elen Rivas. The couple split in 2008 after seven years together, a year before he began dating Miss Bleakley, who he proposed to in 2011.

A spokesman for Miss Bleakley said: ‘Christine will not be relocating to New York. She will remain based in London and will travel to and fro for the duration of Frank’s time [in New York].’

He pointed to the presenter’s ongoing commitments with ITV, including an upcoming six-part travelogue series and a stint on This Morning.
