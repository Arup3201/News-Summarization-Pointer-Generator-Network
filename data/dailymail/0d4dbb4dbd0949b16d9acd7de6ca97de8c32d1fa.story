Harriet Harman today took a swipe at ‘unrealistic’ Fifty Shades of Grey, saying women would rather watch Great British Bake Off than indulge in kinky sex.

Labour’s deputy leader revealed she has read the erotic bestseller for ‘research purposes’ but was left cold by its tales of sado-masochism.

In an extraordinary passage in her speech closing Labour’s party conference, Ms Harman told delegates most women want is ‘not a man who ties you to the bed, but one who unstacks the dishwasher’.

Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman said Fifty Shades of Grey was 'unrealistic'

Ms Harman has been married to Jack Dromey, a former union official and now fellow MP, for 30 years.

A staunch campaigner for women’s rights and sexual equality, she told party activists that in her new role as Shadow Culture Secretary she was always asked what she is reading.

‘Just the other week, I had an awkward moment when a journalist asked me if I'd read "that" book. Women here will know the one...

‘The one about a sado-masochistic relationship - you know…with a dominant superior controlling a naive submissive.

‘And I said: "don't be silly - of course I've read the coalition agreement".’

To gasps in the conference hall, Ms Harman then admitted: ‘As it happens I have also read Fifty Shades of Grey… for research purposes.

‘But I have to say I don't think it's very realistic.

‘Because, let's be honest, what most women want is not a man who ties you to the bed, but one who unstacks the dishwasher while you watch the Great British Bake Off.

Ms Harman also had a dig at Page 3, which she has called to be ditched by tabloid newspapers.

In a parody of the feature in The Sun, she began her speech saying: 'I'm Hattie, 62, from Camberwell. And here’s today’s news in briefs...'

Ms Harman also mocked the Prime Minister
telling the conference: ‘Women are finding it hard to hang onto their 
jobs - and that's just the women in David Cameron's Cabinet.

‘You know Angry Birds used to be David Cameron's favourite computer game
- now it's his pet name for Caroline Spelman and Nadine Dorries.’

Far from reviewing popular 
literature, the deputy leader’s speech at the Labour conference is 
traditionally a tub-thumping affair aimed at sending delegates home with
a spring in their step.

Ms Harman claimed Labour was now in with a ‘fighting chance’ of winning the next election.

‘This week has been special, this week the game has changed.

'We know we have big challenges ahead
but we leave Manchester emboldened, enthused, with a strong sense of 
purpose. We have grown in confidence, we have grown in self-belief.’

Harriet Harman's speech brought the Labour conference to a close before delegates sang Jerusalem and the socialist anthem The Red Flag

And she again attacked the Lib Dems, accusing Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg of propping up a ‘miserable Tory government’.

There had been speculation that 
Labour was cosying up to some Lib Dems after it emerged Vince Cable had 
exchanged text messages with Ed Miliband.

‘Let's not forget Saint Vince is in it up to his neck too. After all, it was his policy to treble tuition fees.

'So I have a message for Vince. Don't bother texting Ed - he's changed his number.’

The
conference ended with the traditional singing of Jerusalem and the 
socialist anthem The Red Flag, accompanied by a group of young 
Manchester singers called Re:verb.

Labour leader Ed Miliband led delegates in singing the 'Red Flag' with help from members of the Reverb choir from Manchester.
