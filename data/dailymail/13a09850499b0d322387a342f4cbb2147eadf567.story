A motorist who killed a university student after losing control of his car when he suffered a seizure at the wheel may have been suffering from alcohol withdrawal, an inquest heard.

Ian King, 56, lost control of his silver Mercedes and ploughed into Chloe Adkins, 20, as she walked along Hagley Road in Edgbaston on 25 January last year.  The third year computer science student died of her injuries.

Yesterday an inquest into her death heard that Mr King's seizure could have been brought on by alcohol withdrawal.

Chloe Adkins, 20, from Northampton, died after she was struck by a car driven by Ian King, 56, from Derby

The driver, of Littleover, Derby, denied the claims and said he had never had a seizure before and only one since.  And a charge of causing death by dangerous driving was dropped when the case was dismissed because of medical evidence earlier this summer. 

The inquest at Birmingham Coroner's Court heard how Miss Adkins, from Northampton, was struck by Mr King's Mercedes as she walked along a pavement. 

Witness Adam Crump told how he had seen the car drive through a red light on the Hagley Road, half a mile before the accident scene.

He was the second person at the crash site and checked on Mr King while someone else performed chest compressions on Miss Adkins, a student at Aston University.

'He was sitting in the driver's seat and was agitated, foaming and having some sort of seizure or fit and was shaking and incoherent,' Mr Crump said.

Giving evidence, Mr King said he had been at a sales training course in Birmingham and was driving to his home in Derby.

He had 'no recollection' of the accident, and said 'The next thing I can remember is waking up in my airbag' and then being escorted into the ambulance.

Mr King said he had never had a seizure before, and had only had one more, while he was sleeping in June last year.

He said after the accident his licence had been revoked so he had not driven since. 

'I will never drive again, even if I'm allowed to and the seizures are under control,' he said.

Asked by assistant coroner Heidi Connor to comment on various doctors saying his seizure was probably brought on by withdrawal from alcohol, he replied: 'No, I have no idea what caused it.'

The inquest heard how Miss Adkins died as a result of a catastrophic brain injury. Her family were able to donate her organs. 

Police investigators said there was a can of lager in Mr King's car but he gave a negative breath test.

Dr Sarbjit Clare, who treated Mr King at Birmingham City Hospital, said all the medical evidence suggested he had suffered a seizure.

'My impression is that it was the result of alcohol withdrawal, but he denied it,' she said.

The coroner said that although she believed it was entirely possible alcohol withdrawal had played a part in the seizure, she was not going to record it as part of her conclusion. 

She recorded a conclusion that Chloe died as a result of a road traffic collision. 

The coroner said it was possible alcohol withdrawal was a factor but did not record it as part of the conclusion
