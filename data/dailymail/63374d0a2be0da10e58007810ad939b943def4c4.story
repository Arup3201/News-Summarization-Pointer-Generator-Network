Visiting different heritage sites is good for your happiness and wellbeing, a new study has found. 

A new report found that visits to heritage sites ranging from historic towns to archaeological remains improve wellbeing to the tune of £1,646 a year for the average visitor.

The figure represents the amount of money which provides the same impact on wellbeing as visiting heritage does, and is higher than the value of taking part in sports, which is calculated as being £993, the report from English Heritage said.

The annual Heritage Counts report illustrates the vital role heritage plays in our national life by measuring its value and impact on individuals and communities.

Of those surveyed, 73 per cent of adults and 69 per cent of five to 15-year-olds said they had visited an historic site in 2013. 

The study looked at eight different types of heritage over the past year and also investigated the monetary value of this positive impact on general wellbeing, estimated at £1,646 per person per year for the average visitor. 

As one of the key drivers of British tourism, heritage also offers a huge economic benefit to the local areas.

In 2011, heritage sites and historical monuments provided 134,000 jobs and an output of over £5 billion.

English Heritage also looked at how such a positive impact can translate into potential community benefit.

Participating in heritage projects helps people to learn about their local history, make connections, form friendships, and develop a sense of civic pride.

A survey of residents in areas where heritage projects had been completed found that 92 per cent believed that the site 'raised pride in the local area.' 

For those who volunteer at the site, the impact is even greater.

One in three volunteers describes a notable increase in self-esteem, as well as a stronger sense of belonging in their communities.

Sir Laurie Magnus, the Chairman of English Heritage, said: 'England's historical environment is a great force for good. It enhances the quality of our surroundings, provides employment, helps underpin our national identity and generally lifts our spirits.

'This year's Heritage Counts provides critical evidence to show the contribution that the historical environment makes towards turning the government's objective of improving the nation's wellbeing into reality.'

John Sell, Chair of the Historic Environment Forum, added: 'It is no surprise that heritage significantly contributes to tourism, but it is fascinating to be able to demonstrates that it also improves our well-being.'
