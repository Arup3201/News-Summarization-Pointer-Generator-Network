Accusations: It has been claimed that Peter and Louise Mensch were long embroiled in an adulterous affair before they got married

A British politician has been accused of having a 20-year extramarital affair with an American rock band manager who she went on to marry.

The family of Melissa Meyer have accused ex-Conservative MP Louise Mensch - née Bagshawe - of having an illicit relationship with Peter Mensch while he was still married to American Melissa.

Ms Meyer's family have voiced 
suspicions that the couple had a 20-year affair when they were both married –
 Peter to Melissa, and Louise to U.S. businessman Anthony LoCicero.   

The two women now live in close proximity in Manhattan after Louise, 41, dramatically announced she was resigning her parliamentary seat in England and moved into a mansion on the Upper West Side with Peter.

Melissa, a 44-year-old former school teacher, remains in the $7million Greenwich Village townhouse she once shared with her husband. 

The likelihood of the two women peacefully coexisting seems especially remote after the startling claim by the family of Melissa, known as Missy, that Peter and Louise were long embroiled in an adulterous affair.

Louise, who was a chick-lit author before becoming a politician, married Peter in June 2011. It followed his divorce from Melissa in December 2010.

Speaking exclusively to The Mail on Sunday, Melissa’s sister-in-law Laura Meyer said the family believe the affair began when Louise, then an undergraduate at Oxford University, invited then 37-year-old Peter to the union to talk about the music industry.

‘I feel it is important to make public our suspicions Louise was having a relationship with Peter which we believe dates back to when she was 18 or 19 years old,’ said Ms Meyer.

‘When Missy found out in August 2009 they had been involved in an affair, she was devastated.’

Last week, Peter, 59, said that their love blossomed in 2009, after Louise separated from Anthony.

Peter was still married to Melissa, but says Louise told him she had loved him for 20 years. Asked if they had an affair before that, he said: ‘Hmmm .  .  . no.’

They stayed in touch after their first meeting in 1990. Louise has credited Peter with helping her land a job with record label EMI. Mr Mensch, 59, manages rock acts including Def Leppard and Metallica.

The same year, Peter married Melissa, his second wife. The couple have 17-year-old twins Eli and Hannah, and a daughter Jona, 16. In 1995, Louise dedicated her novel Career Girls to Peter, thanking him ‘for taking me along for the ride’.

In it, Rowena, a ‘blonde’ and 
‘beautiful’ British woman – educated at Louise’s old Oxford college, 
Christ Church – has a long affair with a married, older Jewish-American 
music tycoon.

He eventually dumps his wife for Rowena. The book features
 a brash American called ‘Marissa’. 

Louise married Anthony in 2000. They had three children, but in May 2009 she announced their separation.

The Mail on Sunday has established that Louise declared her love for Peter in February 2009 at a Metallica gig.

Peter admitted to an affair and 
requested a divorce. ‘Missy did everything to save the marriage,’ said 
her brother Fred. The family said she was ‘creeped out’ by the parallels
 in Career Girls.

Peter refused to discuss the claim of an affair with Louise, saying: ‘I don’t talk about my ex-wife and I don’t talk about Louise. I’m not going to discuss my personal life.’

Melissa signed a gagging order as part of her divorce. 

Mrs Mensch, who has set up a social networking site in the States called Menshn, is aspiring to a TV career in the U.S.

The new Mrs Mensch, the daughter of a wealthy stockbroker and a headmistress, shares custody of her children with her former husband Anthony. Their split in 2009 cited 'enormous stress'.

At the time, friends said no one else was involved in the separation.

Six months later, she and Mr Mensch went on their first date, he told the Mail in 2011. When the pair did marry, they kept it a secret, not even telling Ms Mensch's three children.
