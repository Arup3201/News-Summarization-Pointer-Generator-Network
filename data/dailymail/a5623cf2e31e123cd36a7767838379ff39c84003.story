A conman who drove round in a Jaguar collecting Â£450,000 in welfare handouts under three separate identities turned up at court looking like a binman.

Bert Mooney, 65, created two false identities then claimed disability and housing benefits in those names as well as his own.

Mooney, from Manchester, gave addresses for his alter egos John and George Mooney in London and north Wales.

He would then get behind the wheel of his Jaguar and drive between the locations collecting his giros before cashing them at the nearest post office.

Mooney was eventually caught after a suspicious traffic warden noticed he had a London parking permit registered to a house in North Wales.

The case was then passed to the Department for Work and pensions to investigate.

He was due to be sentenced at Manchester Crown Court after admitting benefit fraud charges but his case was adjourned until Friday after a request from his defence to delay the case for medical reports.

Defence council Mr Andrew Higginson had asked for an adjournment so the defendant's GP could send an up-to-date medical letter.

But Judge Martin Rudland said that the case had gone on long enough and refused a long adjournment, saying he would sentence Mooney on Friday - with or without the report.

He said: 'This is taking on facile proportions I have read his reports, what do we need a GP to say?'

Mr Higginson replied: 'This case has a long and chequered history and a considerable number of adjournments, longer than usual adjournments.

'Mr Mooney has suffered from quite a considerable number of debilitating medical conditions, physical and mental.'

He added that would like the court to pass sentence once a detailed and up-to-date medical report was received from his GP.

Judge Rudland said: 'She can sit down with his notes today or tomorrow and write a one page letter for no later than Friday.

'This takes priority otherwise I sentence without. This has been a long and protracted affair.'

He added to Mr Mooney: 'You are also a fraudster of considerable accomplishment. The case has been going on for over a year and it is vital that it is dealt with because it is in the public interest and in your interest.'

Mooney, who has pleaded guilty to benefit fraud charges, was granted bail.
