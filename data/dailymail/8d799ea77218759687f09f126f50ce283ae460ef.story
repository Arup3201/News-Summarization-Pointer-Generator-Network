Former England cricket star Graham Dilley has died at the age of 52 after a short battle with cancer.

Dilley, who played 41 tests and took 138 wickets, will always be remembered for his heroics alongside Ian Botham and Bob Willis in the 1981 Ashes Test at Headingley.

The fast bowler helped Botham add 117 runs for the eighth-wicket as England turned around a seemingly impossible position to win the match by 18 runs.

Finest hour: Graham Dilley flees the pitch after England win the 1981 Ashes test at Headingley. Dilley, who has died aged 52, played a vital part in the victory

Today Botham, who scored 149not out in the innings, was one of a host of stars to pay tribute to the former Kent and Worcestershire player.

Sir Ian told Sky Sports News of his shock at hearing of his friend's death.

He said: 'We only heard a few days ago how ill Graham was.

'They were saying it was very serious and they were talking maybe two weeks and he's gone in less than two days.

'We're all shocked that this can happen to someone who's 52. Very shocked.'

'I've got so many fond memories of him. He ran in to bowl in the Caribbean, first ball, and the heel fell off his boot.

'Typical
Graham he's only brought one pair with him on an England tour so there 
was panic there, but he was a fantastic cricketer who had a lot of 
talent.

'He was plagued with injuries, his neck and knees, which 
probably stopped him playing a lot more for England, but on his day he 
was the best.

'I had a lot of great times with him. He had a great sense of humour, he always wanted to be part of the party and join in.

'He
was a good bloke to be around. He was quite quiet and reserved until 
you got to know him, he wasn't a great social person until you got to 
know him, but then he was the life and soul of the party.

'It's a very sad day.'

At his best: Dilley bowls in a test match in Australia. Tributes have been paid to him by current and former England stars following his passing

Following his retirement from cricket, Dilley, who played international cricket for ten years and also won the Ashes Down Under in 1986-87 became an assistant coach to the England team.

Two of England's current side paid 
tribute, with paceman Stuart Broad writing on Twitter: 'Very sad to hear
about Graham Dilley. Wonderful fast bowler and lovely man. 52 is too 
young. RIP'

Kevin Pietersen added on the site: 
'What an amazing guy Graham Dilley was.. Always smiling & always 
helping spread his knowledge about our great game. RIP Dill!!! Sad day.'

Senior figures at the England and Wales Cricket Board also paid tribute.

ECB chief executive David Collier said: 'Graham made a lifelong contribution 
to the game of cricket at all levels, and we are deeply saddened by the 
sad news this morning.

'He will be fondly remembered for his contributions, both as a player and a coach.

'Few will forget his contribution 
during the historic Ashes win at Headingley in 1981 and the part he 
played in two Ashes series victories.

'Graham will be sadly missed by all his friends throughout cricket, and ECB send our deepest condolences to Graham's family.

Huge impact: Tributes were also paid to Dilley's methods as a coach, which helped bring through stars such as Monty Panesar

ECB managing director Hugh Morris added: 'This is very sad news for Graham's many friends and colleagues in cricket, both in this country and overseas.

'As well as being a bowler of the highest class, Graham made an immense contribution to our game as a coach - and his ability to impart his knowledge and wisdom to future generations of young cricketers will be sorely missed.'

As well as his stints on the England staff, Dilley was a Loughborough MCC Universities coach and helped the likes of Monty Panesar emerge as international class.

MCC head of cricket John Stephenson, was also appreciative of Dilley's work as a coach

He said: 'I'm extremely sad to hear of Graham's death.

'He was a world-class bowler who I played against many times and he became a very good friend.

'As a coach, he made a huge impact as part of the MCC Universities programme; he was central to the progress made at Loughborough over the last decade and he will be much missed by all of us at the club.'
