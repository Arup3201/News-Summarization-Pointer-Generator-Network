Ronald Koeman and Manuel Pellegrini have dismissed suggestions by Jose Mourinho that Premier League referees have an anti-Chelsea agenda. 

Mourinho claimed there is a ‘conspiracy’ against his League leaders after Cesc Fabregas was booked for diving when his manager thought he should have been awarded a penalty in the 1-1 draw at Southampton on Sunday. 

Saints boss Koeman now accepts that referee Anthony Taylor should have awarded a spot-kick for Matt Targett’s challenge on Fabregas, but claimed it was the sort of mistake all clubs have to cope with over the course of a season.

Mourinho believes there is a deliberate attempt to undermine Chelsea when penalties are not given

And Manchester City manager Pellegrini said he trusted all referees to officiate fairly. Asked for his thoughts on Mourinho’s controversial claims, Koeman said: ‘It’s his feeling, I can’t say anything about that, but I don’t think so. I think referees are human people, everybody makes mistakes. 

‘And I think at the end of the season it’s a little bit in balance. I don’t think teams are more punished by the referee than the rest of the teams. It was a bad mistake from the referee, because when I watched the game afterwards it was a 100 per cent penalty. But sometimes you get a penalty and sometimes you don’t, that’s part of the job.’ 

As Manchester City boss Pellegrini prepared for his side's game against Sunderland, he said: ‘I don’t want to talk about what other managers say because I don’t know what happens in every game. Maybe as a manager we only know what happens against our team. All teams have difficult moments with referees.

'All teams drop points because of referees making mistakes. The first goal by Burnley against us on Sunday was offside. 

'It’s normal and I don’t have any doubt about the way the referees whistle every game. I trust absolutely in the way they do it.’ 

Pellegrini and Mourinho have never got on since becoming rivals in Spain. The ill-feeling has only intensified since they came to England. 

The City manager served a Champions League touchline ban for criticising an official last year, but he added: ‘After the game is not the best moment to talk about decisions, particularly if you have not won. It’s a difficult profession, refereeing.’
