Leicester have agreed a deal to sign experienced defender Matthew Upson.

Upson turned down the offer of a new contract at Brighton in favour of a return to Barclays Premier League football with the Foxes, who this season ended their decade-long absence from the top flight by winning the Sky Bet Championship title.

He will sign a one-year deal on July 1 after his current contract with the Seagulls expires.

On the move: Matthew Upson has signed for Leicester City after leaving Brighton and Hove Albion

The
 35-year-old played 47 games this season for Brighton, winning the 
club's player of the year award and helping them reach the play-offs 
where they were beaten by Derby.

Upson
 started his career at Luton and also played for Arsenal, Birmingham, 
West Ham and Stoke, before joining Brighton last summer after an initial
 loan spell.

Heartache: Upson's last games for Brighton were in their play-off semi-final defeat to Derby County

He won 22 international caps for England and played at the 2010 World Cup.

The centre-back was the last Three Lions player to score in the tournament, as Fabio Capello's side crashed out as 4-1 losers in the last-16 to Germany in Bloemfontein.

Upson
 is the second new signing to be announced by Leicester in the last 24 
hours following the arrival of Charlton goalkeeper Ben Hamer, who has 
agreed a four-year deal with the club.

Up for it: Upson (centre) was the last England player to score at a World Cup during their 2010 last-16 exit
