Scotland Yard made history today after it charged three youths with murder before their alleged victim had died.

Two 14-year-olds and a 16-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, have appeared in court accused of stabbing to death Rashid Naeem.

Detectives decided to charge the teenagers while the market stall holder was still in hospital, because doctors said his injuries were so severe he was certain to die.

The 29-year-old of East Ham, east London, was stabbed two days ago at a street market in Upton Park, also in east London.

Hours after the boys were charged, their alleged victim was pronounced dead.

'The victim remains at an east 
London hospital, however his injuries will prove fatal and consequently 
the three youths have been accused of murder,' a Met spokesman said.

Today's decision to charge three boys with murder before the victim was dead may be the the first time it has happened in British legal history, it emerged today.

The Met's decision overnight marks a new but subtle change in the way some killings could be dealt with going forward.

Sources at Scotland Yard said the charges were brought in advance to ensure a fair trial for the three teenagers.

For hundreds of years any victim of murder had to be dead and police would have to have a body to proceed with a murder case.

This was imposed after a 17th century trial where several men were hanged only for their alleged victims to appear alive and well afterwards.

This framework remained until 1954, where it changed and forensic science improved.

A farmer in Wales was accused of murdering his friend after blood and bone fragments were found in his kitchen. Michail Onufrejczyk, who stayed in Britain after the war, said his business partner had returned to Poland, but police believed he was murdered.

Despite the lack of a body the jury found him guilty and this allowed suspects to be tried for murder based on circumstantial evidence.

In recent years the most high profile use of this interpretation of the law was used to prosecute killer Mark Bridger, above, who was charged with the abduction and murder of April Jones in October 2012.

Officers took the decision even though hundreds of police and locals in the Welsh town of Machynlleth were then still hunting for the five-year-old, whose body was never found.

The force later issued a statement saying: 'Mr Naeem was pronounced dead this morning at Royal London Hospital. A post-mortem examination will be conducted in due course.'

Similar decisions have been made when a body cannot be found, like in the case of Mark Bridger who murdered five-year-old April Jones and hid her.

But Crown Prosecution Service sources admitted it could be a first in these circumstances.

The three teenagers appeared at Stratford Youth Court this afternoon jointly charged with Mr Naeem's murder. 

Magistrates chairman Peter Dawes transferred their case to the Old Bailey for another hearing  on Thursday.

Their alleged victim ran a mobile phone stall in Queen's Market, Upton Park.

Police suspect he believed that the gang were stealing from him and a struggle ensued and Mr Naeem was stabbed.

He was rushed to the Royal London Hospital where his condition was said to be critical.

But he deteriorated and was pronounced dead earlier this morning. A post-mortem examination is now due to take place.

Witnesses to the attack have told of their horror after seeing the trader attacked.

Yalda Badad, 25, a pregnant mother-of-one, was walking through the market with her two-year-old daughter when she saw the 29-year-old collapse to the ground bleeding heavily.

She said: 'People were trying to break them up because they thought they were fighting, we didn't realise he was stabbed until he fell and we saw the blood.

'He stood up again and looked kind of drowsy and then fell over again. The blood was pouring out.

'That man was working very hard for little money. They come at 4am when they open their stall, they are working very hard and somebody comes by, picks up their things and its the difference between life and death. It has scared everybody.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
