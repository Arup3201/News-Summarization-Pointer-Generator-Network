Two gunmen sparked panic and chaos when they opened fire outside a busy nightclub, killing two people and injuring 22.

The gunmen were believed to have been armed with semi-automatic weapons outside Club Elite in Palmetto - south of Tampa, Florida.

Gwenette Matthews, 38, of Bradenton, Florida, and Trayon Goff, 25, of Palmetto, Florida, were both killed early Saturday morning, police said.

‘I was on the floor trying not to die,’ said Chip ‘Blu Chip’ Hunt, a promoter who works with the club management.

‘I was between one who got shot in the back of the head and one that got killed and one gentleman that got Bayflighted (airlifted) out.’

A Palmetto police spokesman said the shooters were outside the club, but some bullets passed through the nightclub's open front door.

Police believe at least one of the shooters was on foot and disappeared in a getaway car.

Mr Hunt, who promoted the club's Friday night ‘Grown & Sexy’ event, said Ms Matthews was socialising inside the club with her sister.

'The wall is like Swiss cheese. (Trayon Goff) had so many wounds it was crazy. He got 75 per cent of the 
shots. That's the one they (were) after'

Mr Hunt said the torrent of bullets seemed to be aimed at Mr Goff who was outside, sitting up against the front wall of the building.

‘The wall is like Swiss cheese,’ he said. ‘He had so many wounds it was crazy. He got 75 per cent of the shots. That's the one they (were) after.’

Mr Hunt estimated 150 people were inside the club at the time.

He said a security guard was hit in the back by one bullet and made sure every patron was at least 25 years old and dressed up for the event.

Mr Hunt said Mr Goff was in a group of younger people who had gathered outside the club.

Of those ‘he was the only one that got 
shot (critically). I don't know if he tried to run and that's why the 
bullets came inside the club.’

'It just scares me. I don’t even want to live here anymore'

Theresa Amado, local resident

The police spokesman said investigators have not yet named suspects or identified a target or motive.

He added that most victims were treated and released. But six were flown to a trauma centre and one remains in a very critical condition.

‘It just scares me,’ Theresa Amado, who lives nearby, told My Fox Tampa Bay. ‘I don’t even want to live here anymore.’

A man was fatally shot and killed near the club last year but prosecutors dropped charges - calling it self-defence, reported My Fox Tampa Bay.
