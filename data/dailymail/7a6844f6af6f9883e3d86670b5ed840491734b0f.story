Nigel Farage this morning rejected claims he has been ‘sent by God’ to save Britain from the European Union – insisting: ‘I’m not the Messiah, I’m a very naughty boy.’

The Ukip leader’s remarks, echoing one of the most famous lines from Monty Python's Life of Brian, came after he was played a clip of a documentary aired this week featuring one of his more obsessive fans.

Former nurse Jill said Mr Farage ‘probably didn’t realise it’ but had been ‘sent to protect us against the EU’.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage this morning insisted he was not the 'Messiah', adding: 'I'm a very naughty boy'

The 59-year old dominatrix, from Poole in Dorset, told the Channel 5 documentary ‘Farage Fans and Ukip Lovers’ that Brussels wanted to install microchips in everyone – and would send people to the guillotine if they refused.

She said Mr Farage, 50, was Britain’s only hope. 'God says when an enemy comes against you like a massive flood, I'll send someone to give you some protection.'

Jill added: 'I think Nigel Farage is sent to protect us against the EU, he wants to bring England back to the English people and stop this foreign invasion of our borders.'

'What Nigel Farage will do by getting us out of the EU is to stop their plans to microchip our people.

'The EU already has the equipment set up and they have death vans like they have in China, equipped with guillotines. 

'They will be sent to houses and work places basically saying receive the microchip or be killed. So off with your head and that's when things start getting unpleasant.'

Played the clip on LBC this morning Mr Farage insisted he was not placed on Earth to save Britain from Brussels.

In Monty Python's Life of Brian, the hapless Brian, played by Graham Chapman (right), is hailed the Messiah - but his mother, played by Terry Jones (left) tells his followers: 'He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy'

He said: ‘Jill, I’m sure, is an absolutely delightful woman, but I have to disappoint her. Jill, I’m not the Messiah, I’m a very naughty boy.’

Jill - who says she once saw an angel in Tesco Express - doesn't just think Farage will save the nation with his foreign policies.

She also believes UKIP is helping Brits become more liberated in the bedroom. She's a fan of bondage herself and says she has met many UKIP supporters who share her fondness for S&M. 

She said: 'I would love a cabinet position as head of bondage. It's my hobby and I do enjoy it, it's all role-play and froth, it's a natural English phenomenon to like it.

'Sometimes I like to be submissive and other times dominant. I have met a lot of UKIP supporters who are into BDSM. They do seem to have a natural bent towards bondage.

'I do think that Nigel Farage has bought a new era and openess to England where we can be more open about our needs to have our bottoms spanked.'

The bondage enthusiast also believes UKIP can enhance the NHS by giving free cosmetic surgery to women who want it, like herself.

'I have been a nurse most of my life, I have my views about the NHS. I think people who need big breasts, who need their nose done, should receive help from the state,' Jill said.

'I think Nigel should look into this. I want big breasts. I have seen my surgeon and I am going to have implants. 

'I think I should get them on the NHS. Nigel could get a higher women's vote by bringing that into play.'
