Environmental campaigners have criticised Government moves to delay until 2015 its plan to charge shoppers for plastic bags in supermarkets.

The introduction of a 5p charge per bag was announced by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg on Saturday, and was welcomed by green campaigners and shoppers.

However, it will not begin in England until 2015, despite already operating in Wales and Northern Ireland, with Scotland following next year.

Banished: From 2015, all supermarkets and department stores in England will charge 5p for a plastic carrier bag

Last night, campaigners fighting the blight caused by bag litter called on ministers to bring forward the launch, saying the delay was unnecessary and disappointing.

Phil Barton of Keep Britain Tidy said: ‘There is no need for new legislation in England as retailers are already geared up to deal with it. We would like to sit down with the Government and the retail sector to discuss introducing a charge earlier.’

He said adopting the controls in 2014 rather than 2015 could result in 5.25 billion fewer carrier bags being handed out at tills.

Ban: The new charge was announced by Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, pictured meeting volunteers from the Scottish Wildlife Trust at Cathkin Marsh nature reserve

The Conservative majority in the 
Coalition is understood to have insisted on a delay until after the next
General Election in May 2015, despite the benefits to the environment 
and that money raised by the charges will be given to charities that 
tackle the impact of plastic bags on wildlife and the environment.

The delay is just one of a number of measures that supporters fear will restrict its impact.

Significantly, the charge will apply only to stores that employ more than 250 people. This will allow thousands of other retailers to continue giving away millions of single-use bags. As a result, the scheme in England will operate differently to the ones in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, where all bags carry a charge.

Separately, retailers may be able to keep some or all of the cash from the charges, rather than being under a legal obligation to give it to good causes.

Destructive legacy: Most free plastic carrier bags are not used for more than 20 minute, but can take up to 1,000 years to naturally dissolve

Keep Britain Tidy and the Marine 
Conservation Society (MCS) are among the many supporters of the Daily 
Mail’s five-year ‘Banish the Bags’ campaign.

MCS spokesman Richard Harrington said: ‘England is really lagging behind the rest, and we would like to see the change come in earlier than 2015.’

The British Retail Consortium, which speaks for the big supermarkets, favours a single national scheme. A spokesman said: ‘Any legislation should be, as far as possible, consistent across the UK to avoid confusion for customers and businesses.’

A Lib Dem source dismissed the criticism, saying: ‘We are introducing this measure on a timetable that is realistic. We want to make sure we get it right.’
