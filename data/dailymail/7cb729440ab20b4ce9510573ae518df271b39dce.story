Fraud charges: Skermer, 45, yesterday before magistrates in Runcorn, Cheshire

A married banker has been charged with stealing more than £2 million from Barclays - allegedly blowing most of it on high-class prostitutes, it emerged yesterday.

John Skermer, 45, is accused of stealing £2,148,793 from accounts under his control over a period of almost five years

It is understood the father of two then spent £1.9 million of the cash on prostitutes – with £1million going to one escort girl alone.

The rest is believed to have been splashed on luxury items such as  holidays and fast cars.

The alleged fraud was discovered during a routine audit by bosses who called in police.

Yesterday Skermer appeared before magistrates in Runcorn, Cheshire, after being charged with four counts of fraud by abuse of his position.

Alison Warburton, prosecuting, told the court Skermer also blew the money on gifts for family and friends, including luxury golfing holidays and tickets to see Manchester United matches.

He also bought himself a £35,000 Audi car and handed £25,000 to a female acquaintance that he had met just once in order to help her move house.

‘Mr Skermer was in a position of authority within the bank which he exploited,’ Mrs Warburton said. ‘It was a breach of trust. And he took a vast amount of money from the bank.

'He used the money to fund his lavish lifestyle. Around £700,000 has been recovered, but the bank are still working to recover stolen goods.’

It is understood Skermer began working as a manager for Barclays in 2006. His role included looking after a software engineering team and retail accounts for the banking giant. The charges relate to a period of almost five years, between January 2009 and this month.

Skermer, of Widnes, Cheshire, was granted bail before his next appearance at Chester Crown Court in April. He was accompanied to court by his maths teacher wife Tracy, 33.

The couple, who have been married for ten years, live in a £400,000 detached house in Widnes with their two children.

A spokesman for Barclays said no customers had been affected.

‘Protecting our customers’ money is our top priority and we have a zero tolerance approach to fraud,’ she said.

‘No customer has lost any money as we’ve taken swift and immediate action to ensure that this matter has been dealt with.’
