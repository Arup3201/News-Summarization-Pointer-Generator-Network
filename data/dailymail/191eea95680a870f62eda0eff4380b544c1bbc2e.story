Britain has become a ‘neglectful society’ in which families fail to look after their elderly relatives, a minister has said.

Norman Lamb said it was getting to the stage where the state will be unable to cope with soaring numbers of elderly people.

The care services minister said the country would have to rely on armies of volunteers to step in to help and look after vulnerable and lonely pensioners.

Contact the Elderly say the number of lonely pensioners aged over 75  was higher than any time in the charity's 50 year history

The intervention came as a charity warned that tens of thousands of older people are trapped in ‘loneliness hot spots’ – so much so that social isolation for the most vulnerable in society has reached a ‘state of emergency’.

Trevor Lyttleton, chairman of Contact the Elderly, said the number of lonely pensioners aged 75 or older was at higher than at any time since he founded the charity almost 50 years ago.

Some go whole weeks without any human contact, and more than 1,200 people are on the waiting list to join the charity’s monthly tea parties which provide almost the only contact many pensioners have with the outside world.

Last week, the problem of loneliness was highlighted when the body of a woman in her seventies was found in her Bournemouth flat, where it had remained undiscovered for six years.

Anne Leitrim had not been seen since 2008 and neighbours simply assumed she had moved out of the area.

Mr Lamb’s comments recall those of Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who said earlier this year that Britain needed to learn from Oriental countries where families look after their elders.

In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Lamb warned that in modern Britain, people rarely visit their elderly relatives – meaning there has to be a response from local communities and the society. ‘The state can’t do it on its own,’ he said.

Unlike Spain, where more elderly people are looked after by their families, the Lib Dem minister said the UK had ‘inadvertently become quite a neglectful society’.

The minister said there was ‘an overwhelming case’ for volunteers to fill the gap left by ‘the dispersal of the extended family’.

He called for a ‘21st century version of Neighbourhood Watch’ to battle isolation, which he said was a more urgent concern than crime.

‘On our very streets we have people who live on their own, who don’t see anyone and whose relatives might visit once a month or whatever, but what’s life line in between?’ he said.

He said there was a limit to what families could do ‘if your mum is 400 miles away, or even in a different country’ and said there was increasingly a ‘dispersal’ of families in Britain with people going to university and getting a job.

Local authorities have cut their adult social care budgets by 26 per cent in real terms over the past four years, but Mr Lamb said his call for more volunteers was not a ‘cost-cutting option’.

‘If you think about the pressure that the system’s under now, and then you think about the growth from 1.9million people with three or more conditions to 2.9million, how on earth do we manage that? It’s an existential challenge to the system.

‘If you care about sustaining the NHS, we’ve got to find ways of making that possible – we have to think more creatively than we’ve done in the past.’

Contact the Elderly warned that it was having trouble meeting tens of thousands of lonely older people in many of our cities – in particular Birmingham, Derby, Blackpool and Canterbury.

Mr Lyttleton said: ‘Loneliness among older people has reached a state of emergency and must not be ignored. My mantra is, if not now, when?

‘For almost 50 years, we have been focusing on providing a cost-effective solution, yet the demand for our service has never been so high.

‘We know our formula of tea and conversation works, but we simply cannot reach out to the people that desperately need our help without increased volunteers and funding.’
