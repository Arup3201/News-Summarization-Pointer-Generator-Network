Will MacKenzie hit a hole-in-one and four birdies on Saturday as he took a share of the lead at the McGladrey Classic in Georgia.

The 30-year-old American aced the three-par sixth hole on his way to carding a five under 65, which puts him level with Andrew Svoboda at the top of the leaderboard.

MacKenzie joins Svoboda - who will be left lamenting a double bogey on the 11th as he notched his third successive 66 - on 12 under overall and they share a one-shot lead over the rest of the field going into the final day.

Despite hitting the hole-in-one on the front nine, MacKenzie explained how the experience was 'boring' after there was confusion over whether he had actually managed the feat or not.

'Most anti-climactic hole-in-one I ever had,' he said on the PGA Tour website.

'Finally, there was this random guy over there, like one of the four guys clapping earlier. They were like, "Yeah, it went in. Didn't you hear us clap?" I was like, "Thanks, man. You guys are low-key here".

'They're used to seeing great shots. They're used to your Matt Kuchars and the guys, studs. I made a hole-in-one. It means nothing other than it was a 1 on the scorecard. It was just the most boring hole-in-one ever.'

Andrew Svoboda shares the lead with MacKenzie on 12 under par after a third-round 66

Overnight leader Russell Henley dropped a shot on the five-par 15th and could only manage three birdies as he carded 68 to sit in third on 11 under.

Stewart Cink leads a five-strong group two shots further back after he carded eight birdies to get the best score of the day on 63.

Andrew Putman and Chris Kirk both carded rounds of 66 to join Cink on nine under, alongside Fabian Gomez and Brendon de Jonge.

Swede Carl Pettersson is highest-placed European in Georgia on six under after he hit two bogeys and the same number of birdies to finish on 69.
