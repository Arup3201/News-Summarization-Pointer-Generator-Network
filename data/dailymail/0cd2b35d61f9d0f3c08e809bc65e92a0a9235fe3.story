A three-year-old girl bitten by a
pygmy rattlesnake while playing on her daycare center's playground is recovering.

Sarah Lawson's grandfather said the girl was playing outside the Sunny Daze centre in East Manatee County, Florida when the foot-long rattlesnake bit her finger, injecting her with a dangerous venom, theÂ Sarasota Herald-Tribune reports.

'It was pretty serious,' her grandfather Barry Rainwater
told the paper. 'She only weighs 28 pounds.'

Recovering: Three-year-old Sarah Lawson is seen during her three-day recovery in a Florida hospital after bitten by a pygmy rattlesnake

Venom: Sarah's arm is seen, marked by doctors who measured her swelling after being injected by the snake's dangerous venom

Without shedding a single tear - despite the excitement of
an ambulance, oxygen mask and an IV needle, her mother said - the girl was
rushed to All Children's Hospital in St. Petersburg.

Her mother, Shannon Rainwater, said both the incident and her handling of it all explains her
preschool's given nickname: 'firecracker.'

At home, she has a different name.

'At home we kind of nicknamed her Tinkerbelle,' she told
NBC. 'She's a tinkerer. She likes to tinker with things she's not suppose to
and apparently she tinkered with the wrong thing the other day.'

Mr Rainwater said his granddaughter told him she was trying
to move the snake from the area, 'and reached to pick it up,' when she was
bitten, launching out a loud scream.

Reaction: Sarah's mother Shannon Rainwater, seen holding the girl, said her daughter's handling of the bite was impressive, not shedding a single tear

Firecracker: At home the girl is nicknamed Tinkerbelle, thanks to her fondness of tinkering with things she shouldn't, while at school they call her Firecracker

'She probably gets that from me,' her father Nathan Lawsom
told the Bradenton Herald of her curiosity and fearlessness. 'I didn't have a problem as a kid picking up snakes and
playing with them.'

Mr Rainwater said Sarah spent three days in the hospital and
credits the day care staff for identifying the type of snake.

He says physicians monitored the girl carefully after her
hand swelled and the poison moved up her arm.

An anti-venom stopped it from going any further.

Common find: The girl's grandfather says the snakes are extremely common in the area, a pygmy rattlesnake seen, while her father says he use to pick up snakes himself as a kid

Condition: Sarah is said to be back to her usual self, according to her family, with no signs of the snake's venom causing her left hand's muscle to deteriorate, as feared by doctors

'It's one of those things that you assume there's a medical
solution for, but a kid was bitten about 10 years ago in Lakewood Ranch, and he
died,' he told the Tribune.

Rainwater says Sarah is at home now and doing fine,
even using her hand to colour despite doctors' fear the snake's toxins could have dissolved her
muscle.

'Like it didn't even happen,' her mother said while holding
her daughter.

The centre's playground was closed following and the area's
mulch was raked up, according to the grandfather.

He said people would be surprised how many snakes can be
found within the area.
