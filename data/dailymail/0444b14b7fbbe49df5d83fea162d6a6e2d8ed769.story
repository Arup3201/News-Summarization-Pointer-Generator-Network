Garth Brooks has tearfully claimed how he doesn't understand receiving nothing for a $500,000 gift to a hospital in honour of his late mother.

The country music star is suing Integris Canadian Valley Regional Hospital in his hometown of Yukon, Oklahoma, for allegedly going back on a promise.

He claims they went back on a pledge to build a women's health centre and name it after his mother Colleen, who died of cancer in 1999.

‘How this thing went wrong, I don't know,’ he told a court in Claremore, Oklahoma. ‘I'm the last of six kids. I was her favourite. She was my buddy. I was her biggest fan.

‘She was a pistol. All of the parties were at her house. She was just a doll. If anybody met her, (they) would have gotten to love her.’

The centre was never built - and Brooks, who said he had a ‘done deal’ with the centre and president James Moore, wants his money back plus damages.

Brooks, 50, said Moore initially suggested putting his mother's name on an intensive care unit then later said they could put it on a women's centre instead.

‘I jumped all over it,’ Brooks said. ‘It's my mom. My mom was pregnant as a teenager. She had a rough start. She wanted to help every kid out there.’

Brooks said he gave $500,000 to the hospital anonymously, which he said was his custom when giving to charities.

The singer said he, his family and the hospital wanted to keep things quiet until a ribbon-cutting ceremony to announce the centre.

He was shown architectural drawings of a proposed centre bearing his mother's name. ‘That's why I thought it was a win-win for everybody,’ he said.

But nothing happened and the centre was never built. His mother's name was never attached to anything at the hospital.

Moore told the court a women's centre was not in the hospital's plans, but Brooks said Moore never told him that before he donated the money in 2005.

Three years later, he exchanged emails with Moore after he was told the money would be used to help fund new construction, Brooks said.

‘As nicely as I can, I'm trying to give him an opportunity to say why he's spending the money and there's no women's centre going up,’ he testified.

Brooks said he sent his accountant to investigate what happened, but nothing came from the ongoing correspondence.

By March 2009 he had asked the hospital to either refund his money or give it to another charity. Then he sued them in September 2009.

‘I thought this was going to be mom's chance to bring a women's centre to my hometown,’ Brooks testified.

Brooks's accountant, Cheryl Harris, testified on Friday that she wasn't aware of any conditions on his donation, which was listed as a tax deduction.

Asked by Integris lawyer Terry Thomas how she believed the money would be used, she said: ‘He didn't receive anything physical.’

Brooks is the top-selling solo artist in U.S. history, with at least 128 million albums sold. His testimony is expected to resume on Monday.
