At first glance this map might look like a Catherine Wheel spitting out colourful sparks, but this stunning image in fact shows the routes of millions of commuters who journey into London every day.

The map was created by an academic who used data collected by 50 million Oyster card journeys to investigate how people arrive at their workplace in capital.

The result is fresh look at the busiest stations used by commuters and while there are some notoriously hectic spots like Bank listed, there are also some surprising omissions, including King’s Cross station.

Dr Manley's map shows the connections formed between all London stations and their most popular destinations.  A link has been drawn between the two places, and the link and points coloured according to the destination. Each destination is given a different colour

Dr Ed Manley, a research associate at University College London's Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (Casa) created the map based on data collected at the busiest times on weekday mornings – between 7am and 10am.

‘Looking at morning peak, as we have done here, we can start to understand a little more about the relationship between where people live and where they work,’ he told the Standard.

His map suggests that City workers are most likely to live in east London or Essex, while people living south of the Thames tend to use Waterloo, London Bridge or Victoria to get to get to work.

The trends indicated by the map (pictured) hint at the interdependencies that underlie the relationships between places in London.  It is clear, for example, that much of travel from south London is focussed on just three end points ¿ Waterloo, Victoria, and London Bridge.

He told MailOnline: 'I think the map shows some well understood and some not-so-obvious trends. The fact that travel from south London is attracted to only three main stations - Victoria, Waterloo and London Bridge - is maybe predictable, but the map reflects well the dependency that south London holds on these few stations. 

'Likewise, the strong connections between the City and east London may be well known, but the map shows how widely this influence spreads.'

The data represents 48.9 million journeys documented over 49 days in the summer of 2012 - which average out at one million morning peak trips per day and night.

Strikingly, King’s Cross station is missing from the map. Dr Manley explained in a blog post that despite popular perceptions, the station is not a popular end-point for commuters as there are currently not many offices nearby, but it remains one of London’s busiest stations.

‘This may not be where people end their trips. They [commuters] may well pass through King’s Cross St Pancras – indeed, a failure at King’s Cross could be catastrophic for many travellers – but it is not where the leave the system,’ he wrote.

‘In this sense, King’s Cross is an important point on the network but not a place that many people actually get off.’

'The same might be said for places like Baker Street and Green Park - important points on the network, but not the final destination for many,' he told MailOnline.

Some of London’s tourist hotspots and business hubs have unpredictable travel patterns as they attract people who live all over London and its sprawling suburbs.

Locations such as Oxford Circus and Canary Wharf attract travellers from all over the city, Dr Manley explained.

Dr Manley said: 'I think the map shows some well understood and some not-so-obvious trends. The fact that travel from south London is attracted to only three main stations - Victoria, Waterloo and London Bridge - is maybe predictable, but the map reflects well the dependency that south London holds on these few stations

He said that the popular shopping destination’s star-like distribution of links indicates that it is attractive to commuters from all over the capital.

‘Canary Wharf, too, shows a spread of origin points to the east, the north-west along the Jubilee line and to the south-east,’ he wrote.

Dr Murray believes the trends might show the accessibility of these stations across multiple routes and their accessibility from all over the London.

'The general assumption too is that most travel revolves around central London, but the map reflects a different story in the outer suburbs. 

'As we move away from central London, the influence of places like Hammersmith, Uxbridge, Stratford, Croydon and Barking increases and there are clearly some very important local patterns in these areas.'

His work is part of ongoing research into how Oyster Card data can describe travel behaviour in London.

'The aim is that the lessons we learn here can be used to inform how we improve and extend the transport network in London,' he added.
