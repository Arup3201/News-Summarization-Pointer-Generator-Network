These pictures show Free Syrian Army fighters firing homemade rockets towards forces loyal to President Bashar Al-Assad.

Taken today, the photographs show rockets being fired from the back of a tractor in Ashrafieh, Aleppo.

They were taken on the same day Syrian troops killed at least 40 opposition fighters in an ambush near Damascus.

The bloodied bodies were strewn on rocks near a dried-out lake along with scattered rifles and ammunition.

President Bashar Assad's forces, backed by Lebanese Hezbollah gunmen, also seized control of a rebel ammunition supply route on a highway linking the capital to its eastern suburbs.

Assad's forces have been gaining ground in rebel-held areas around the capital, the seat of his power, and have made progress against outgunned and fragmented fighters in several areas.

Today, the state-run news agency SANA said 40 rebels died in the ambush near Otaiba, adding that soldiers seized a large arms cache, including anti-tank rockets.

The area is part of a region known as Eastern Ghouta, which was the scene of a horrific chemical weapons attack in August believed to have killed hundreds.

The state-run Al-Ikhbariya television station broadcast footage showing more than a dozen bodies near the largely dried-out Otaiba lake, some wearing flak jackets strapped with ammunition.

Automatic rifles and hand grenades lay nearby.

A top UN humanitarian official implored the Security Council to exert more pressure of Syria's warring sides

An unidentified Syrian army officer in the area told Al-Ikhbariya there were foreign fighters among the dead and that the ambush followed an intelligence tip.

'It was a highly accurate operation,' the officer said. 'We will be moving from one victory to another.'

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist group that tracks Syria's crisis, said at least 24 fighters, some of them foreign, were killed in the ambush. It gave no further details.

It comes on the same day a top UN humanitarian official implored the Security Council to exert more pressure of Syria’s warring sides.

Valerie Amos said the UN’s urgent appeal for more access to delivery desperately needed aid has made little difference.

She
said that ‘as we deliberate, people continue to die unnecessarily’ and 
called on the council ‘to exert influence and take the necessary action 
to stop this brutality and violence’.

The
statement came after the council unanimously approved its first binding
resolution on Syria, ordering the elimination of its chemical weapons.

But Amos told the council that its appeal has made little difference on the ground.
