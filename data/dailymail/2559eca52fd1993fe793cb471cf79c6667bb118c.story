Three penalty appeals - which the referee does not feel are enough on their own to award a spot kick - should not add to a penalty kick but that’s what appeared to benefit Arjen Robben and Holland in Fortaleza.

Ref Pedro Proenca is used to players exaggerating and simulating in his native Portugal. He even knows Robben from Champions League matches and he appeared to be prepared to wave aside theatrical falls during the game.

The penalty which was given came from poor defending from the experienced Rafael Marquez, who from his days at Barcelona should know better than to put his leg in the way of a player like Robben.

VIDEO Scroll down to watch the fall and falls of Arjen Robben

Tumble: Robben goes over and the Portuguese referee awards a penalty deep into injury time

Score of 11: Robben won the penalty in injury time but he worked hard to get the referee's attention

Say no: Arjen Robben makes his point to Pedro Proenca but the Portuguese referee turned down his shout

Decisive: Rafael Marquez brought down Arjen Robben for a late penalty that sent the Dutch through

First claim: Hector Herrera took a boot to the head after challenges from Stefan de Vrij and Ron Vlaar

Penalty shout: Hector Moreno looked to catch Robben in the penalty area as he challenged for the ball

VIDEO Dutch party rumbles on

A case can be made for a penalty but for me the way that the Dutchman dives with legs flying out behind him would stop me giving that penalty.

There was a much clearer incident which should have resulted in a penalty for Holland just before half time when Robben was perhaps caught by Marquez but then wiped out by Hector Moreno.

Mexico themselves had a clear penalty when Hector Herrera was through on goal and Ron Vlaar flew in with a high boot to stop the Mexican.

Decider: Marquez appeals after Robben goes down for the late penalty that won Holland the game

Big call: Robben tried to jink around Marquez but appeared to be caught by Mexico's captain

Difficult decision: Mexico appeal - in vain - after Robben went down to win the stoppage time penalty

Influence: It was a big call for Pedro Proenca with both sides appealing for a decision in their favour

High risk: Marquez was booked for the challenge that saw Proenca award a late penalty to Holland

Two on one: Rafael Marquez and Moreno were both involved as Robben went down in the area

Ouch: Robben reacts after the challenge but he could not convince the referee

Decision: Proenca elected not to award the Mexicans a penalty for this challenge by Ron Vlaar

Head shot: Herrera went down under the tough challenge but the referee deemed it not a penalty

It had to be seen as dangerous play and 
in such situations if there is physical contact then a direct free kick,
 or penalty if it occurs in the 18 yard box, should be given.

There was another penalty appeal in the 67th minute when Robben (naturally) threw himself to the ground but Proenca rightly waved the appeals away.

They say cheats never prosper but when referees merely wave aside dives insead of cautioning the cheat, then they will dive and dive again and often, as in this game, eventually ‘win’ penalties which are so crucial.

Painful: Herrera falls to the ground as Vlaar looks on but no penalty was given by the referee

Still not happy: Robben and Proenca have a chat during the first half cooling break

Respected: Proenca was in charge of the 2012 Champions League final and is highly regarded by FIFA
