Ten reasons to give Manuel Pellegrini a sliver of hope that Manchester City can catch Chelsea. Ten reasons to disturb Jose Mourinho as he turns his full focus on the Barclays Premier League.

Mourinho has a five-point lead to preserve at the top of the Barclays Premier League and a game in hand if he is to bring the title to Stamford Bridge for the first time in five years.

What had seemed set to break into a procession at times could yet become a contest if Chelsea cannot kick the habit of throwing away the lead. It has happened 10 times this season and the unwanted trend has accelerated since the turn of the year.

Problems seemed to kick in after the draw against Sunday's opponents Southampton, at St Mary's, on 28 December. It was a day when Mourinho fumed about penalties not awarded and a 'campaign' against his team.

Maybe the Chelsea manager had already detected signs of what might lie ahead.

Games are more difficult after the New Year, with Capital One Cup semi-finals and a final and the first knock-out round of the Champions League. 

Fatigue starts to bite with a manager with a small core of players he seems happy to use, which don't include Filipe Luis or Lois Remy.

Yet it is Chelsea's inability to close out many games which will trouble Mourinho.

His teams have consistently boasted this quality, and it remains. They closed out the Capital One Cup final against Spurs expertly, but seven times in 15 games since the turn of the year they have let a lead slip.

It might be more likely to develop into a battle if Manchester City were not misfiring, too. Arsenal and Liverpool are in more fluent form but a little further adrift. Too far adrift. Chelsea are not about to implode spectacularly.

Over the campaign, they have been easily the best in the Premier League. They will probably win the title. Rather, tiny problems have cropped up where there were none. If nothing else, it will keep Mourinho busy in the summer, in his restless quest for perfection.

He will prioritise another central defender, with Raphael Varane top of the list, and will work to tighten up a defence which has shown tiny uncharacteristic flaws.

Opposing teams will have noted how Thibaut Courtois, amid a brilliant season, has had issues with crosses whipped in, six yards from goal. 

Both PSG goals were headed in from this region. So was Burnley's equaliser. And Manchester City's equaliser came after he was beaten in such a duel by James Milner.

Mourinho will also like to add another defensive option in midfield, for the really big games at the business end of the Champions League.

Missing only John Obi Mikel from his squad, his midfield was dominated by PSG and Nemanja Matic, outstanding all season, played at full stretch, his passing not at its best, under pressure against Blaise Matiudi, Thiago Motta and the excellent Marco Verratti.

The form of Cesc Fabregas has been flat since his return from a hamstring injury and when he doesn't dazzle he does not have the defensive strengths to satisfy his manager. There are games against teams like PSG, when Mourinho would like another strong athletic presence alongside Matic.

Diego Costa has been more noticeable for his physical play and histrionics than his goalscoring ability 

Without the creative flair of Fabregas, the goals have dried up for Diego Costa, who may be off the pace because of his ban, as Mourinho claimed, but also seems to be distracted by the need to prove he will not change his physical game to appease those who don't like it.

Eden Hazard shows no sign of losing his mojo but Drogba's influence has faded through the season and Remy does not appear to be trusted. So Chelsea expect be in the market for options up front, too.

Mourinho always says a manager can never be happy and even if, as expected, he goes on to claim the title, he will be busy this summer. Some people thought he had already built one of the great teams of the modern era, but there is work to do and no-one knows it more than him.
