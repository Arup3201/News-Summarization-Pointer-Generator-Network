Gun-crime in the UK may still be rare, but a drive around our roads reveals that it is far closer to home than you might have thought.

In fact, hundreds of road signs are peppered with bullet-holes, rather than pellet holes, made by ammunition from illegal firearms.

From a No Stopping sign near the A40 in Oxfordshire that has been shot seven times to the Hungerford road sign near where Michael Ryan shot 16 people dead, many of our road signs are riddled with sinister bullet-holes - a result of gunmen using them as target practice.

Sinister: This No Stopping sign near the A40 in Oxfordshire is riddled with what appear to be bullet-holes

This shot-at sign on the A614 in Humberside bears testament to the murky world of illegal firearms

Matt Seiber found this road sign near Hungerford, where Michael Ryan went on a shooting spree, killing 16 people

Former Marine Matt Seiber, 58, who has travelled the land in search of signs that have been shot at, says there is plenty of evidence of illegal firearms if you look for it.

He believes Britain's road signs are being used by killers and other criminals to test their weaponry before they unleash it on a live target.

'I find evidence of people modifying shotguns, similar to what Raoul Moat did by putting weight into shotgun pellets,' he said.

'There are specific types of location that you find them in, and I get a gut feeling when I think I'm in the right spot.'

His astonishing pictures show bullet-holes in hundreds of signs across 36 counties, some of which the Falklands veteran believe may have been put there by Britain's most notorious killers.

Driving through Cumbria, close to where taxi driver Derrick Bird murdered 12 people in June 2010, Mr Seiber saw bullet-holes he believes were caused by Bird.

Mr Seiber says these holes were made by a high velocity rifle in the Oxfordshire countryside

'I've found sights that I think could be linked to Derrick Bird; but it's impossible to be sure,' he said.

He is also convinced about the road-sign outside Hungerford, the quiet Berkshire market-town where in 1987 Michael Ryan shot dead 16 people including his own mother before shooting himself dead.

Before he embarked on his massacre, Ryan told an employer he liked to go out at night to shoot at things on the road-side.

Mr Seiber, who photographed the local road sign with bullet holes, drives thoughout the country in his job as a corporate driver, and picks routes near scenes of notorious shootings.

'I will purposefully travel on a route that I think may have bullet holes in,' he said, adding that Oxfordshire and Cumbria had particularly high numbers of signs that had been shot at.

This is the legacy of a round from a high velocity rifle that was fired from a field into a Warwickshire sign

Mr Seiber's interest in the subject began when he saw some men shooting at a road sign in Madrid years ago.

'I was 300m from a small road when I saw three guys firing hand-guns at a road sign,' he said.

'One of them started shouting at me, then suddenly they were shooting and bullets were flying over my head.'

This narrow escape was followed by a stint in the Royal Marines, which familiarised him with guns, enabling Mr Seiber to identify what different models are being used on road signs.

He said: 'The majority of weapons used are rifles and shotguns, not handguns so much.'

Mr Seiber records his project on his website gunfire-graffiti, and has also written a book called Gunfire Graffiti: Overlooked Gun Crime in the UK.
