Ready for retirement? David Cameron was seen doing shopping and enjoying a slice of cake near his home in Chipping Norton

David Cameron looked as if he was preparing himself for the quiet life today as he was spotted picking up some shopping and watching his son play football.

The Prime Minister was seem walking out of a shop in Chadlington, near Chipping Norton, holding a carrier bag filled with shopping as he tucked into a slice of cake.

He was pictured gorging himself on the slice as he walked around the market near his Oxfordshire home, paying for fruit and veg and chatting with locals.

The Conservative leader, who today finally reached an agreement with opposition parties and broadcasters on televised election debates, was earlier seen watching his son Arthur play football for Chadlington FC. 

Despite Arthur's under-9s team losing 2-1, Mr Cameron remained in good spirits as he chatted with other parents during the match.

Sporting a black jumper and cosy black Berghaus coat, the Prime Minister later picked up a few essentials from Sainsbury's, carrying them in a bag for life.

He was then seen entering Chadlington Quality Foods - a community-run bakery and deli - leaving a few moments later with a slice of cake in a white paper bag.

Mr Cameron stopped to chat with a few market traders before paying in cash for some fruit and vegetables. 

The Prime Minister's jaunt through the Oxfordshire town came on the day it was finally announced that broadcasters and political leaders had reached an agreement on televised debates in the run up to May's General Election.

Broadcasters have confirmed plans for a seven-way discussion on April 2, as well as a range of other programmes before the nation goes to the polls. 

The first will see the Mr Cameron and Ed Miliband  interviewed separately before answering questions from a live studio audience.

The Labour leader will then appear in a BBC debate with counterparts from Ukip, the SNP, the Greens and Plaid Cymru two weeks later. 

The final encounter will be a special Question Time on BBC One on April 30. Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Nick Clegg will answer questions separately from a studio audience.

There will be no head-to-head debate between the Prime Minister and the Labour leader.

Labour immediately branded Cameron a 'coward' for avoiding a head-to-head debate with Miliband.

A source said: 'The cowardice of David Cameron is still preventing the head-to-head debate on the 30th. 

'Cameron is now in the ludicrous position of saying he will attend the same programme and take the same questions from the same audience as Ed Miliband, but will not debate him face to face.'

A Labour spokesman added: 'After weeks of pressure from the Conservative Party, Channel 4 and Sky have indicated to us that they are unwilling to stick to their commitment of March 6 to proceed with the head-to-head debate programme if David Cameron refused to take part.'

But a Tory source insisted they had secured a better deal than they were hoping for.

'If anything this is an improvement on the deal we were offered last week. The PM has always believed too many debates would suck the life out of the campaign,' they said.

'In all these formats, we are confident the choice between competence and chaos will be clear.'

A Liberal Democrat spokesman said they were happy to take part in the proposed format.

'If it was down to us, we would be in every TV debate and every interview and are ready to take part in any of them,' they said.

'But we think that the politicians and broadcasters have ducked and dived on this long enough and just need to get on with it now.'
