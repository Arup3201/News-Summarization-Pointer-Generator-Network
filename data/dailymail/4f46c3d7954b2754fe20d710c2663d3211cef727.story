Families in Scotland are being plunged into bitter rows about independence, with another three months to go until the referendum.

More than four in 10 people say their relatives are split on whether to break-up the UK, with one in five admitting discussions about Scotland going it alone have ended in a row.

With both sides stepping up campaigning, 38 per cent of people fear the country will be left 'badly divided' whatever the outcome of the vote.

Voters in Scotland will have their say on independence in the referendum on September 18. 

Much of the focus has been on the debate between politicians, with Alex Salmond pushing his dream of independence while the likes of George Osborne, Alistair Darling and Gordon Brown warn of the dangers.

But a new opinion poll reveals how the arguments are not confined to politicians, but are being played out around the dinners tables of Scotland.

The ICM poll for Scotland on Sunday found 38 per cent of those surveyed think Scotland will be left badly divided after September 18, whatever the outcome, while 36 per cent disagreed.

More than two in five (42 per cent) said members of their family have different views on whether Scotland should be independent, while 38 per cent did not.

Just over a fifth (21 per cent) said conversations about Scottish independence with family and friends have ended in a row, while 69 per cent disagreed.

The study also showed that the gap between Yes and No has narrowed, while a poll for Yes Scotland showed support for independence has reached a 'campaign high' of 48 per cent.

The ICM poll of 1,003 people found support for independence is at 36 per cent, two percentage points up on an equivalent poll last month.

Support for the No vote dropped three percentage points to 43 per cent compared to May's equivalent poll, while 21 per centwere undecided, up one point.

When undecided voters were excluded, support for Yes was 45 per cent, three points up on last month. Backing for a No vote was 55 per cent, down three points.

At the same time, a Yes Scotland poll, conducted by Panelbase, found 43 per cent of those surveyed backed a Yes vote, while 46 per cent supported No and 12 per cent were undecided.

When those undecided were excluded, support for independence stood at 48 per cent while backing for a No vote was at 52 per cent.

The poll of 1,060 people also asked how they would vote if the 2015 UK general election was going to result in a Conservative-led government, or another Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition at Westminster.

Almost half (49 per cent) said they were likely to vote for Scottish independence, while 41 per cent said they were unlikely to do so.

When don't knows were excluded, the result was 55 per cent for Yes and 45 per cent for No.

Asked about the scenario of a Labour-led government at Westminster, 45 per centsaid they were likely to vote for independence while 45 per cent said they were unlikely to do so. When don't knows were excluded, the split was 50/50.
