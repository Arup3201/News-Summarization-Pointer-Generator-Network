Harry Kane is closing in on the record for scoring in the most consecutive away matches in Premier League history after his match-winning brace at Queens Park Rangers.

In all competitions, the Tottenham striker has scored more goals (26) this season than any player in England's top four tiers, and his away form has been particularly impressive.

Kane has scored eight goals in his last six away Premier League games. Only Robin van Persie has surpassed that achievement in the competition's 23 seasons.

Robin van Persie - Nine (Arsenal 2010-11)

Harry Kane - Six (Tottenham 2014-15)

Daniel Sturridge - Six (Liverpool 2013-14) 

Didier Drogba - Six (Chelsea 2009-10)  

Kane scored at Swansea, Leicester City, Crystal Palace, West Brom (two), Liverpool, and QPR (two) to put him second on the list overall. 

The 21-year-old is tied in second place with Didier Drogba, who achieved the feat at Chelsea in 2009-10, and Daniel Sturrridge, who did the same at Liverpool last season.

Van Persie's remarkable run came in his penultimate season at Arsenal where he scored in every single league away game from January 1 to May 22.

This is just the latest statistic a spectacular season for Tottenham academy graduate Kane.

He is currently the top English scorer in the Premier League and the third highest scoring player from Europe's top five leagues (behind Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo) and could become the first Tottenham player in the Premier League era to break the 30-goal barrier.

Jurgen Klinsmann managed 29 in all competitions during the 199-95 season for Spurs, Kane needs just four more from the remaining 10 games to beat that.
