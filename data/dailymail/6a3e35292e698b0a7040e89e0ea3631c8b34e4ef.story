Americans are ditching dollar bills and paying with plastic more than ever before, according to a survey which found that nearly one in 10 no longer carry around paper money.

The study also revealed that 78 per cent of Americans carried less than $50 in paper money and nearly half carry $20 or less every day.

A report drawn up by Bankrate.com found that nine per cent of the country have stopped carrying around cash altogether.

One in ten Americans has given up carrying cash around on a daily basis according to a survey

The website’s chief financial analyst, Greg McBride said: ‘If we move to a truly cashless society, it won't be much of an adjustment for most Americans.

‘The vast majority of Americans carry $50 or less on a daily basis, which seems to indicate that it's more out of necessity than a desire to pay with cash.’

CNBC reports that the survey, carried out by Princeton Survey Research, also found  gender played a part in who was carrying around more cash.

Around 70 per cent of men carried less than $50 compared to 86 per cent for women.

Is America moving closer towards a cashless society?

Just seven per cent of Americans chose to take $100 in cash with them on a daily basis

The figures add to suggestions that some nations are moving towards becoming cashless societies.

Just weeks ago it was revealed how consumers had increased their borrowing in March by the largest amount in more than a year, using their credit cards and taking out more auto and student loans.

Consumer borrowing increased $17.5 billion in March, up from a gain of $13 billion in February, the Federal Reserve reported.

It was the biggest monthly increase since a $19.3 billion advance in February 2013.The category that includes auto and student loans rose $16.4 billion while the category that covers credit card borrowing increased $1.1 billion.

The overall increase in consumer debt pushed total borrowing to a record $3.14 trillion.
