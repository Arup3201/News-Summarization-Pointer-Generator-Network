One is famed around the country as one of Essex's most famous faces. The other is the party who took the county by storm in last week's local elections.

But it emerged today that Joey Essex is completely oblivious to Ukip or the huge electoral landslide the party performed in the county from which he takes his name.

The fact that one 21st century phenomenon has remained unknown to the other is perhaps not surprising after the former-Towie heartthrob also revealed he doesn't even know how to vote.

Joey Essex may be the author of a new book, but he confessed he has no idea how to vote in an election

Ukip, led by Nigel Farage (left), made huge gains in Essex last week, but one of the county's most famous faces, Joey Essex (right) was completely oblivious to the result

The revelations emerged as Joey - dressed in a white hoodie and skinny black jeans, with fluorescent pink trainers and a black Chanel necklace - was greeted by a 500-strong crowd of screaming fans at a book signing at the White Rose shopping centre in Leeds.

His autobiography, Being Reem, sold out of WHSmith in the shopping centre by 11am as excitable teenage fans queued from 7.30am for the TV star to sign their copy.

Joey posed for pictures with scores of his elated fans, many of whom sobbed as they came face-to-face with the I'm a Celebrity star.

Speaking ahead of the book signing, Joey refused to answer questions about his girlfriend Sam Faiers' comments about how she can't wait to be Mrs Essex - coyly muttering: 'You'll have to ask her about that.'

Fans both male and female travelled from miles around to see their idol at a shopping centre in Leeds today

The appearance attracted hundreds of screaming fans, who arrived hours early to get to the front of the queue

But when asked how he voted in last week's local and European elections, he looked confused, and laughed: 'I didn't vote. I don't even know how to vote. I'll have to learn for the next one.'

Ukip won more than 20 new seats in council elections in Essex last week, prompting party leader Nigel Farage to call himself an 'honorary Essex man'.

But Joey confessed he had never heard of the party, adding: 'Who? I don't know anything about them.'

But he was keen to talk about his new book, describing it was 'everything about me - my life, my job, growing up in Essex, behind the scenes of Towie'.

Asked to explain his self-made vocabulary including 'reem', he said: 'There's a Joey Essex dictionary in the book so buy a copy and you can find it all out.'

Charlotte Taylor arrived at 7:30am for the book signing and said: 'All my friends will be so jealous'

Joey said his book included 'everything about me - my life, growing up in Essex and behind the scenes of Towie'

He added: 'I didn't write the book myself. I got a ghost writer. I couldn't do it myself - my handwriting's awful.'

Among the crowd was Joey Essex lookalike Eddy Macina, 16, of Leeds, who queued from 7.30am to meet his idol.

He said: 'Yeah, I do look a bit like him. It's the eyes, and the eyebrows. It's cool - he's reem.'

Nursery worker Charlotte Taylor, 19, of Leeds, was first up to meet the star - screaming as she said: 'I can't wait to meet him.

'I've been here since half 7, I want a picture with him and for him to sign my shirt. All my friends will be so jealous.'
