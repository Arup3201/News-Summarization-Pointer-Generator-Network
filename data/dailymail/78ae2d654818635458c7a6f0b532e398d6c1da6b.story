Kalee Buetow of Maple Valley, Washington may be the Seattle Seahawks'
most adorable football fan. Not only can the 3-year-old name every single
member on the team by heart, she can also recite the number on their jerseys.

‘She just sort of randomly started picking up on some names
and would just be randomly talking about them as she was playing, and it was
like, 'How did you remember that, you know?,’ said her father Evan Buetow to KOMO.

Kaylee was featured on 'Eric's Little Heroes', a KOMO program hosted by Eric Johnson dedicated to young sports fans and players.

Kalee’s love for the Seahawks led her to want to know just
about everything about them. Instead of Kalee’s father reading his daughter
books before bed, he reads her the team roster and adds a new player every night.

'She just kept asking to learn more, and then it
snowballed from there with basically the whole team and some of the backup
players and the coaches,' her
father Evan said.

She can name the coach Pete Caroll, the running back
Marshawn Lynch, and even rarely used players like Jermaine Kearse.

She can confidently name back-up players and team
coordinators like offensive line coordinator Tom Cable.

According to Kaylee's family, the only things Kaylee likes to talk about before bed are the Seahawks and Jesus.

When asked why she knows so much about the team, Kaylee's response was, 'because I love them.'

Kaylee is not the only Seahawks fan in the family. Her father, Evan Beutow, has an entire Pinterest board dedicated to the  Seattle football team.

Kalee Buetow and her father, Evan Buetow, are two major Seattle Sehawks fans.
