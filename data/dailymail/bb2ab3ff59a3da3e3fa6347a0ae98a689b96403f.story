Men with shaved heads and wearing orange robes are scouring city streets impersonating virtuous monks and unknowingly ripping off thousands of Australians.

These alleged scam artists enter the country on working holiday visas and present people with gold tokens or blessings and then demand money in return.

They are then using this money to pay for their bills and return tickets back home, A Current Affair reported.

New South Wales Minister for Fair Trading Matthew Mason-Cox warned generous Australians to stop handing over their money to the fake monks who cannot verify where the funds will be going.

A city worker, only named as Chris, told the Channel Nine program he saw fake monks hitting people up for money almost every day when he got coffee.

He said their first obstacle was trying to get people's attention, which they did by forcing a gold token which read 'Work Smoothly Lifetime Peace' into strangers' hands.

'They're asking for a donation. People tend to give them a couple of dollars, five dollars or ten,' Chris said.

'They're actually wanting up to $50, $75.'

Chris said they could also get forceful with people.

'Some can become quite aggressive. When I took a photo of one he tried to get my phone and threw a few punches. He didn't connect,' he told A Current Affair.

But Chris is not alone. 

People took to social media to express their outrage at these people who were impersonating monks and duping Australians out of their hard earned money.

'We were approached on Southbank on Saturday in Melbourne. He told us to write our name on a piece of paper then the word 'peace'. He asked for 50.00. We gave him 2.00. This is terrible. These frauds needs to be stopped,' one woman wrote on Facebook.

While another said: 'I am glad we only parted with $10. He [the monk] tried to take the $20 note we had. And here I was thinking I was doing a good deed. Very disappointed, I could of given that money to someone who deserved it.'

NSW Minister for Fair Trade Matthew Mason-Cox has condemned the fake monks' behaviour, labelling the activity as a 'scam'.

'It's difficult because these people are always on the move. The reality is we need to get them when they're out there on the street. The best thing people can do is not give them money,' he told A Current Affair.

'It is a breach of the charities law for them to be on the street canvassing for charities because they aren't licensed.'

Mr Mason-Cox added the impostors may also be breaking consumer law with their misleading and deceptive conduct. 

The Federation of Australian Buddhist Councils has echoed the minister's sentiments.

'In no way do we condone ordained people, a monk or nun, wandering the streets collecting money,' the federation said in a statement to the program.
