Schools must crack down on the teaching of Islamic Sharia law and promote English criminal law as part of a ‘British values’ drive.

New ‘strengthened’ government guidance, published yesterday, demands that pupils are ‘made aware of the difference between the law of the land and religious law’.

The Department for Education document on ‘actively promoting’ British values in state schools stresses the need for action within lessons as well as extracurricular activities.

It came as it emerged that a second rural school has been marked down after effectively being judged too English.

St Lawrence School in Horncastle, Lincolnshire, was criticised by Ofsted for failing to promote British values in the wake of the Trojan Horse scandal – an alleged Islamist plot to take over schools in Birmingham.

This is in addition to the six private Muslim schools that were warned by the education watchdog last week that they were at risk of closure because their pupils could be vulnerable to radicalisation.

Pupils at one school in the East London borough of Tower Hamlets were unable to tell the difference between Sharia and English law and told inspectors that a woman’s job was to ‘stay at home and clean and look after the children’ and ‘cook and pray’.

The latest DfE guidance says that pupils ‘must be encouraged to regard people of all faiths, races and cultures with respect and tolerance’.

It adds: ‘It is expected that pupils should understand that while different people may hold different views about what is “right” and “wrong”, all people living in England are subject to its law. The school’s ethos and teaching, which schools should make parents aware of, should support the rule of English civil and criminal law and schools should not teach anything that undermines it.

‘If schools teach about religious law, particular care should be taken to explore the relationship between state and religious law. Pupils should be made aware of the difference between the law of the land and religious law.’

Since September, private and maintained schools have been expected to ‘actively promote’ British values as part of a drive by Education Secretary Nicky Morgan. The new guidance for state schools says pupils must be able to ‘distinguish right from wrong and to respect the civil and criminal law of England’.

Examples of actions schools could take to promote British values include considering ‘the role of extracurricular activity, including any run by pupils’.

Revised guidance for independent schools was also published simultaneously by the DfE.

Meanwhile, St Lawrence School in Horncastle was criticised by inspectors because youngsters’ awareness of ‘wider Britain and other cultures’ outside of rural England was too weak.

Ofsted said the school, which caters for 140 special needs pupils aged five to 16, was ‘good’, but it could not be rated outstanding.

Executive head Lea Mason told the BBC it was a ‘big challenge’ finding cultural diversity in the countryside because some of the school’s pupils were unable to ‘sit on a minibus for a long time to get to somewhere that has more cultural opportunities’.

A week earlier, a nearby school – Middle Rasen primary – also came under fire from Ofsted because its mainly white pupils had a ‘lack of first-hand experience of the diverse make up of modern Britain’.
