They may still be five games away from lifting a fifth European Cup but Barcelona's win against Manchester City on Wednesday evening did ensure the Catalan giants broke a record.

Luis Enrique's side became the first team to reach eight consecutive Champions League quarter-finals after seeing off the Premier League champions 1-0 on the night and 3-1 on aggregate.

Ivan Rakitic's first-half strike made for a relatively comfortable evening for the La Liga leaders, particularly after Sergio Aguero fluffed a penalty in the 77th minute.

Before the game Barca were level on seven consecutive Champions League quarter-finals with rivals Real Madrid and Manchester United.

Los Blancos, who are also in the last eight after squeezing past Schalke last week, made seven quarter-finals in succession between 1998 and 2004, while United managed the same feat between 1997 and 2003.

Barcelona have consistently made it through to the latter stages of the competition since 2008, winning finals against United in both 2009 and 2011.

The Nou Camp outfit also lifted the famous trophy in 2006 when they beat Arsenal in Paris, although they were eliminated by Liverpool at the last 16 stage the following season.

Real were even more impressive during their run as they won the competition in 1998, 2000 and 2002, seeing off Juventus, Valencia and Bayer Leverkusen in each of respective finals.

Sir Alex Ferguson could only manage one final during United's seven-season streak but the Red Devils did emerge victorious against Bayern Munich in 1999 to complete the treble.

With the Copa del Rey and La Liga also in their sights, Lionel Messi and Co will be hoping to do the same this season.
