Al-Jazeera journalist Mohamed Fahmy is set for an 'imminent' release from prison in Egypt, Canada's foreign minister has said.

A dual Egyptian-Canadian citizen, Fahmy has been held for more than a year on charges of spreading false news. 

He has reportedly relinquished his Egyptian citizenship in exchange for his freedom.

John Baird, Canada's foreign minister, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation he expected Fahmy's release, but gave no specific timing. The development comes after Fahmy's Australian colleague Peter Greste was released on Sunday. 

Hopes for Fahmy's release have also been raised after a decree passed by Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi that allows for the transfer of foreigners on trial.

But Heather Allan, head of newsgathering at Al-Jazeera, admitted she wasn't confident locally-based producer Baher Mohamed, an Egyptian, would be released.

'(But) are we going to keep on fighting it? Absolutely,' she said. 'We are not going to leave him there.'

Mohamed's family have pinned their hopes on a presidential pardon or his acquittal on appeal.

Greste yesterday revealed it was traumatic leaving his colleagues behind in a Cairo prison and he didn't truly believe he was being freed until he was seated on a plane bound for Cyprus.

He used his first interview since being deported from Egypt to call on the country to release other detained journalists including Al Jazeera colleagues Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed.

'You spend 400 days in such close proximity with people and you really get to know them very, very well,' the 49-year-old told Al Jazeera in Cyprus on Monday.

'So it was a very difficult moment walking out of that prison, saying goodbye to those guys, not knowing how much longer they will have to put up with this.'

Greste, Fahmy and Mohammed were arrested in December 2013 and later convicted over their coverage of the violent crackdown on Islamist protests that year.

Mr Baird spoke with his Egyptian counterpart on Sunday and said he welcomed Greste's release. He said he remained hopeful that Fahmy's case will be resolved in 'short order.'

Fahmy's brother, Adel Fahmy, said authorities gave him a stark choice: 'dropping the nationality or his freedom.'

'It was a very difficult decision. Mohamed is very proud and comes from a patriotic family of high ranking military and policemen that have defended this country and fought its wars,' Adel Fahmy said.

He said many of those family members are offended and upset at Mohamed for dropping his nationality and don't want to even say goodbye to him.

Adel Fahmy said his brother, who was Al-Jazeera English's Cairo bureau chief, was devastated but his fiancée and his mother told him do it. He said authorities told his brother he would be allowed to return as a tourist.

Greste yesterday told Al-Jazeera that he wasn't expecting to be released ahead of a scheduled retrial. Then, as he exercised in prison on Sunday, a warder called him over and told him to pack his things.

'I said "What do you mean?" and he said "You're going" and I said "Where, to another prison?" and he said "No the (Australian) embassy is coming they'll be here in an hour".'

He said even when driving to the airport on Sunday he wondered if his ordeal was really coming to end given there'd been other moments when freedom appeared imminent but was 'snatched away'.

'So I really didn't want to let myself believe it really was happening until I got my backside on a seat on the plane with my brother Mike and we knew, then, that for me at least, this is over.'
