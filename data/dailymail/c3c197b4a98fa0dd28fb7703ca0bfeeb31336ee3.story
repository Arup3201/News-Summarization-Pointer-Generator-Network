Searching on the internet for illnesses that match your symptoms can actually lead to more beneficial consultations with a GP, say researchers.

A study found that patients who bring their own information to a doctor are listened to attentively by their GP and are able to build relationships with them.

But despite the increasing popularity of home diagnosis, those involved in the survey said they still trusted their GP’s advice over what they found on the internet.

The study, undertaken by University College London (UCL), asked 26 patients to discuss the negative and positive aspects of exploring their conditions online before seeing a doctor.

The majority of respondents said that GPs often acknowledged their concerns and offered professional support.

But some patients felt that their own research unearthed deficiencies in their doctor’s expertise and felt that they were ‘unwilling to admit their lack of knowledge’ and ‘disregarded the information’.

Other patients suggested that the abundance of information online intimidated their doctors and said they worried that the doctor felt ‘undermined or threatened’.

Professor Roger Jones, editor of the British Journal of General Practice, which is publishing the report, said that doctors are now often faced with informed patients because of the internet.

He said: ‘While this study is based on a relatively small number of patients, it is likely to be indicative of what most GPs are seeing in their consultations every day.

‘Patients of all ages use the internet and many now attend their GP appointment with information that they have researched themselves.’

He added: ‘Whereas GPs might have been sceptical in the past, many are increasingly using this as a way of opening up the discussion and engaging patients, which can lead to a more productive consultation.’

Another study released earlier this year, however, found that one in four British women have misdiagnosed themselves on the internet - then bought the wrong product to try to cure their illness.

The study, commissioned by feminine health brand Balance Activ, said: ‘Dr Google’ is now the first port of call for women with health concerns, but that online searches rarely provide an accurate diagnosis.'
