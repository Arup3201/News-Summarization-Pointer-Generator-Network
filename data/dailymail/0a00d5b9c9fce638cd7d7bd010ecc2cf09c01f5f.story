As one of the most secretive nations North Korea remains something of an enigma to the outside world.

But one teenage girl, who happens to be the daughter of Google chief executive Eric Schmidt, has been able to capture a rare glimpse of what life is like in the communist state and posted a revealing account along with pictures on her blog.

Sophie Schmidt, 19, was allowed to visit the country earlier this month with her father to promote the use of the internet.

Strange travels: Sophie Schmidt, the daughter of Google chief executive Eric Schmidt travelled with her father to North Korea earlier this month and recently wrote a lengthy blog post of her observations, including photos of the secretive country

Real or make-believe? While university students also have carefully-monitored Internet access and are under strict instructions to access only educational materials, most North Koreans have never surfed the web

Despite her dad remaining tight-lipped
over the exact reasons why they were there, his daughter's musings have
become something of an internet hit with people living in the 
outside world clicking onto her blog. 

She describes how the group of nine, 
led by former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson, were told to leave their phones and 
laptops behind in China because they were warned they would be 
confiscated when they arrived in North Korea.

She added: 'It's impossible to know how much we can extrapolate from what we saw in Pyongyang to what the DPRK is really like. 

'Our trip was a mixture of highly staged encounters, tightly-orchestrated viewings and what seemed like genuine human moments.'

Cold: She described her trip as very strange and very cold; here, the frozen capital of Pyongyang

Warm reception: Despite the secretive nature of the culture and the pre-arranged photo-ops, Ms Schmidt observed that the delegates all felt welcomed

Government state: They entered the country having left their laptops and cell phones in China because they were warned the North Korean government would confiscate them

Learning experience: Ms Schmidt said ordinary North Koreans live in a near-total information bubble, without any true frame of reference; she likened it to 'The Truman Show,' but on a national scale

The blog seems to suggest that a 
number of events they attended were staged, likening the country to 
The Truman Show, a film starring Jim Carrey. 

She said: 'Ordinary North Koreans live in a near-total information bubble, without any true frame of reference. 

'I can't think of any reaction to that except absolute sympathy. 

'My understanding is that North 
Koreans are taught to believe they are lucky to be in North Korea, so 
why would they ever want to leave?

'They're hostages in their own 
country, without any real consciousness of it.'

According to Ms Schmidt the party had been 
told to assume that everything had been bugged, however they were 
'treated very well'  'even though official relations between the US and 
DPRK are very tense.'

Dear leader: Ms Schmidt said the experience at Kim Il-Sung Library was one of the most unsettling, stating in her blog that she didn't know whether the people were actual students

Chintz: She also noted that while many of the buildings they saw looked impressive, none of them were heated and many of the rooms had the strange combination of luxury and 1970s chintz

Austere: Propaganda posters were frequent amid bleak-looking houses

But the most disturbing part of the 
trip for Ms Schmidt was visiting Kim Il-Sung Library. She wrote: 'We 
knew nothing about what we were seeing, even as it was in front of us.

'Were they really students? Did our 
handlers honestly think we bought it? Did they even care? Photo op and 
tour completed, maybe they dismantled the whole set and went home.'

During their trip, the delegates also paid a visit to a university in the capital to look at how North Koreans use computers.

While university students at Kim Chaek
University of Science and Technology and the Pyongyang University of 
Science and Technology have carefully monitored Internet access and are 
under strict instructions to access only educational materials most 
North Koreans have never surfed the web.

Matter of opinion: North Koreans are taught to believe they are lucky to be in North Korea and they're hostages in their own country, she wrote

Computers at Pyongyang's main library 
at the Grand People's Study House are linked to a domestic
service that allows them to read only state-run media online and access a 
trove of reading materials approved by North Korean officials.

'We knew nothing about what we were 
seeing, even as it was in front of us. Did 
our handlers honestly think we bought it? Did they even care?  Photo op completed, maybe they dismantled the whole set and went home.'

North 
Koreans with computers at home can also sign up for the Intranet 
service.

Mr Schmidt, who oversaw Google's 
expansion into a global Internet giant, speaks frequently about the 
importance of providing people around the world with Internet access and
technology.

Google now has offices in more than 40 countries, including
all three of North Korea's neighbors: Russia, South Korea and China, 
another country criticized for systematic Internet censorship.

Using science and technology to build 
North Korea's beleaguered economy was the highlight of a New Year's Day 
speech by leader Kim Jong Un.

The body of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il lies in state at the Kumsusan Memorial Palace in Pyongyang

Following on from Lenin, Mao and Ho Chi Minh, the body of Kim Jong II has gone on display in the state mausoleum in Pyongyang.

And he looks remarkably good considering he has been dead for over a year, according to visitors.

British travel agent, who has seen the former leader, told The Times: 'They've done a good job - he looks very lifelike compared to other mausoleums.

'This was certainly a lot better than Mao's, which is very rushed and underwhelming experience.'

Among other items on display are his boat, the railway carriage in which he suffered his fatal heart attack in December 2011 and the Apple laptop he was working on when he died.

Tourist have to bow at the feet and arms of the body but not the head which is considered disrespectful.

It is believed a team of Russian experts carried out the embalming process which involved removing his organs, extracting his blood and placing the body in a vat of embalming fluid.
