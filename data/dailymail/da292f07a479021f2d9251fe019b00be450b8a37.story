Families hitting the road for the half-term holiday face paying double for lunch at motorway services compared with supermarket prices, a study has revealed.

The average picnic lunch for a family of four costs nearly £32 from service stations but is just over £15 from Asda, research by the supermarket found.

Some services charged as much as £2.40 for a bottle of water, while sandwiches, sweets, fizzy drinks and crisps were at least twice the normal price at the roadside.

Comparison: How supermarket prices compare with service stations

Researchers studied prices at the four biggest motorway services providers: Roadchef, Moto, Welcome Break and Extra.

They
 found hugely inflated prices, including bags of Haribo selling for 
£2.99 in Moto, compared with £1 in Asda, and BLT sandwiches at nearly £4
 in Roadchef, Moto and Welcome Break, compared with £2 in the 
supermarket.

At a Roadchef on 
the M6 Toll in Staffordshire, a lunch consisting of a BLT sandwich, a 
standard-sized chocolate bar, a packet of crisps and a litre of water 
cost £8.33.

The equivalent lunch would cost £4.05 – less than half the price – from the supermarket.

Other
 service stations also hiked prices, with the same lunch costing £8.18 
at a Moto services on the A1 in Lincolnshire, £7.94 at a Welcome Break 
in Oxfordshire and £7.06 at an Extra on the M40 in Beaconsfield, 
Buckinghamshire.

Buying petrol from services could also cost around £10 a tank extra, with fuel costing up to 15p more per litre.

Busy: Millions of drivers will take to the roads this weekend - and often end up stopping in service stations

The
 study was published as the AA predicted 17million cars would be on the 
roads over this Bank Holiday weekend, with Monday being the busiest
 day of the year as it coincides with the start of half term.

Tom
 Hill, pricing expert at Asda, said: ‘We recommend planning ahead and 
with the cash you save, treat the family to games or snacks to share or 
perhaps use the extra money to fill the car with fuel for your trip.

‘By pre-packing a lunch for the family, you could save yourself close to £100.’

A
 spokesman for the RAC said: ‘There is no reason why fuel and food costs
 should be higher, other than these service stations have a monopoly and
 appear to charge whatever they like.’

Prices
 in the survey relate to food on sale in WHSmith stores at Roadchef and 
Extra, M&S Simply Food at Moto and Waitrose at Welcome Break.

None of the four services providers could be contacted for comment last night.

In
 the past they have defended their high prices by saying they run a wide
 variety of services 24 hours a day so have large overheads..
