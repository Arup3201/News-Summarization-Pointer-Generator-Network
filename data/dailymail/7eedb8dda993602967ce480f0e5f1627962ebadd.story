If someone asked you to name the only occasion lawmakers are permitted to drink alcohol in the British House of Commons, what would you say?

Most Americans probably wouldn't know the answer. But one man will never forget it after he guessed incorrectly on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire - and lost $225,000.

Journalist Justin Peters, whose episodes aired this week, wrote about the life-changing experience in a first-person column  for Slate.

Journalist Justin Peters wrote about how losing $225,000 during Who Wants to be a Millionaire? changed his life by showing him he could take the risks needed to pursue his dreams 

The night before the competition Peters told his sister that 'under no circumstances' would he quit and walk away with the money. It was million or bust. But that didn't make the defeat any less crushing 

From the moment he decided to audition, Millionaire was a breeze for Peters. 

He had first appeared on the popular ABC game show as an in-studio lifeline for a friend who was competing on the show last summer.

Producers loved the pair's banter so much that Peters sailed through the preliminary rounds - a trivia test, an interview and a practice game - when he decided to take a crack at the show for himself months later.

Peters said he wasn't thinking about money when he decided to tryout for a spot in the hot seat. He just wanted to have some fun. 

And that's not much of a surprise. As the writer notes in his article, nobody has won a million dollars on the show since 2009. 

So it was easy for Peters to promise his sister the night before his appearance that he wouldn't quit and walk away with the money if he didn't know the answer. 

It was million or bust. 

As he talked out the choices with host Terry Crews, Peters decided the right answer had to be 'crowning a royal' because it was a 'celebratory occasion'

But when it came time for Peters to play the game, he was a pro. He said the questions only seemed to get easier as the possible sum getting added to his bank account got higher. 

And as the love for Peters from the audience, producers and host Terry Crews continued to grow, so too did his confidence and excitement.

'At $100,000 I started laughing uncontrollably. At $250,000, I fell to the floor,' he wrote. 'In 15 minutes, after answering a couple of questions, I had become rich.'

'And now I was only two questions away from $1 million.' 

And then came the $500,000 question: 'Drinking alcohol in the British House of Commons is strictly forbidden at all times, with the single exception of a lawmaker doing what?'

Peters said he immediately eliminated half of the choices, which was 'declaring war' and 'taking the oath of office'.

But he was wrong - the only exception to the prohibition of drinking alcohol in the House of Commons is during the passing of a budget. Peters would only receive $25,000 

Peters said he realized that taking the gamble when there was such high stakes was a life lesson. And when he re-watched his performance on screen, he saw just how well he could command an audience and work a stage

That left him with only two more: 'crowning a royal' and 'passing a budget'.

Peters would later find out that only two people have lost the $500,000 question in 10 years, noting 'it's very hard to justify gambling $225,000 on a hunch'. 

But Peters said he knew he was always going to gamble. What he didn't know at the time was that he was about to become the third person to lose the question. 

As he talked out the choices with Crews, Peters decided it had to be 'crowning a royal' because it was a 'celebratory occasion'.

The host tried to remind Peters what he would lose if his guess was wrong but Peter's response was to ask, 'unreasonably cocky' he notes, what he would win if his guess was right. 

'Let's make this a game, Terry,' he told Crews.  

Final answer? He was wrong. 

The only exception to the prohibition of drinking alcohol in the House of Commons is during the passing of a budget.

Peters was out $225,000 in seconds. He would only receive $25,000. 

As the producers led Peters out of the studio they praised his engaging, fun and TV-worthy performance. 

Peters, an aspiring comedic actor and screenwriter, will use part of his winnings from the show to fund an upcoming tour with his comedic improv duo

One producer told the writer he was 'more of a man' that anyone she knew, before admitting he was the best contestant she'd ever had.  

But all Peters could think about was what he had just lost. An aspiring screenwriter and comedic actor, he had been hoping to use the money as a cushion so that he could finally pursue the dreams he'd put on the back burner for so long. 

Peters was so upset the night of the loss that he drove from New York to Boston to be with family. 

But he said it was the next day, as he walked around and ruminated on the experience, that he understood it was not about what he had lost - but what he could gain.

Peters said he realized that taking the gamble when there was such high stakes could be a life lesson. It has proved to him that he had the courage to take risks, the kind that he had been too scared to take so far in his career. 

And when Peters re-watched his performance on screen, he saw just how well he could command an audience - how he could work a stage. 

Peters has decided he will spend the entire sum he received from Millionaire pursuing his dreams. 

For starters, he's taking his improv duo on tour.
