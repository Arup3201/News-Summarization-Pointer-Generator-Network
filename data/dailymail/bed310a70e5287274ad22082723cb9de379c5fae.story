Giant lumps of lard and baby wipes have been discovered clogging Denver sewers. 

The 'fatbergs', described as clumps of festering food mixed with wet wipes and cooking oil, have been found blocking more than a thousand miles of pipe under the streets of Denver, Colorado.

Sewage workers have been forced to crawl 50 feet into the main pumping station's narrow tunnels to pull out the baby wipes by hand.

Denver Wastewater Management’s Lupe Martinez told Fox 31 grease from cooking, poured down about 150,000 kitchen drains, is the biggest problem they face in keeping the sewer lines flowing smoothly.

But the fastest growing environmental concern is disposable wet wipes which don't dissolve and clog the pumping station.

At least once a month, workers have to climb 30 to 50 feet down a narrow tunnel to reach the pumps and clean out the wet wipes.

'New mothers are dumping more into our system. The elderly senior homes are using them more and they’re just flushing them down the toilet and that’s causing a lot of problems,' he said.

'Those wipes they get into our wells and 
they clog together, and it’s too much for our pump system.   We have to physically go down there and collect all the wipes and bring
them up and get rid of them through the trash system.'

Martinez told Fox 31  sewage workers found a giant grease bubble in pipes underneath the home of one resident who complained his drains were backing up.

Workers discovered the Warren Ave, Denver, resident had been regularly pouring grease down his sink, causing it to harden in a lump in the sewer and block the line.

So much grease had oozed into the main, workers had to clean it several times.

Denver's festering fat chunks are reminiscent of 'The Fatberg', a disgusting 15 tonne blockage  discovered in pipes under Kingston in south London earlier this month.

The
blockage was so critical it threatened to blast untreated sewage 
through manhole covers onto the streets of one of the leafiest London 
boroughs.

Engineers who found the colossal blockage of congealed fat said they had never seen anything like it.

Gordon Hailwood, waste contracts 
supervisor for Thames Water said: 'We've never seen a single, congealed 
lump of lard this big clogging our sewers before.

'Given
we've got the biggest sewers and this is the biggest fatberg we've 
encountered, we reckon it has to be the biggest such 'berg' in British 
history.

Rivers of filth: If workers hadn't cleared the mass, raw sewage could have spurted out of manholes across the whole of Kingston

'The sewer was almost completely clogged with over 15 tonnes of fat.

'If we hadn't discovered it in time, raw sewage could have started spurting out of manholes across the whole of Kingston.'

The blockage was discovered after residents in nearby flats complained they couldn't flush their toilets and repairs could take six weeks to complete.

Workmen used a high-pressure jet of water to blast away the massive blockage over 10 nights.

Mr Hailwood said homes and businesses need to change their ways, and when it comes to fat and wipes people need to 'bin it, not block it'.
