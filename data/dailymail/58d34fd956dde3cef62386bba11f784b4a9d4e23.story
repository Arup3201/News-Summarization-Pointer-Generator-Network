Tory backbenchers have accused ‘teenage spin doctors’ in Downing Street of pressurising ministers to retract ‘truthful’ comments on immigration.

It comes after Defence Secretary Michael Fallon was apparently slapped down for remarks he made on immigration during a TV interview.

He said some communities felt ‘swamped’ and ‘under siege’ by European migrants. But hours after making the comments on Sunday he retracted them – seemingly following an intervention from Number 10.

Defence secretary Michael Fallon (left) and skills minister Nick Boles (right) both retracted outspoken comments they made about immigration - something which has been criticised by Tory backbenchers 

And on Tuesday, skills minister Nick Boles suggested that Britain would never have full control over its borders so long as we are a member of the EU.

He also told Total Politics that Britons need to get used to the fact that there will be a ‘very large amount of immigration every year’.

Later he also sent out a retraction, saying he did not believe the UK cannot seek to change the way immigration works within the Union.

Downing Street sources insisted that the ministers had decided themselves to issue their own clarifications, but some Conservative backbenchers remained unconvinced.

Stewart Jackson, MP for Peterborough, tweeted: ‘Fallon absolutely right to use the word “swamped” about “some” immigration hotspots despite what teenage spin doctors at No 10 might say.’

Yesterday, Mr Jackson said: ‘I think it was unfair on Michael Fallon because there are significant parts of the country where people are feeling what he said.

‘It was poor form to cut the legs from under him in hours over one word. He spoke the truth and it was unnecessary for them to exacerbate the situation by undermining him.’ 

He added: ‘The public don’t want to be told what the problem is – they want to be told the solution.

‘The reason the public is impatient on immigration is that they keep being told the problems but not the solutions. I think the solution is leaving the EU if we can’t get control of our borders back.’ 

Philip Davies, MP for Shipley, said: ‘What Nick Boles said wasn’t anything controversial – he was merely stating a fact. The Prime Minister knows that well – that’s why the immigration figures are so high. Why he has been slapped down for telling the truth is beyond me.

‘If Number 10 think these retractions will prove anything to the public, then they’re living in cloud cuckoo land.’

He added: ‘This has now happened to two ministers. After the debacle of making Michael Fallon issue a retraction after making sensible comments, you’d have thought they would have learned their lesson – but what happened to Nick Boles shows they haven’t.’

Several hours after Mr Fallon told Sky News that he believed some communities were ‘swamped’ by European migrants, a government ‘source’ sent round a quote saying: ‘He accepts he should have chosen his words better. He should have said under pressure.’

And Mr Boles’ retraction read: ‘I do not believe and did not say that we cannot seek changes to the way immigration works within the EU. Quite the contrary, I think it is essential that we do so.’
