Two buildings on the University of Arizona campus were placed under lock down as police search for a man allegedly seen carrying a rifle in one of the two buildings on Friday evening

The campus' Administration Building and Modern Languages building were evacuated after a 911 call came in at 4.52pm reporting the sighting, university officials in Tuscon say.

Authorities and school officials said there was no immediate sign of a gunman and no report of any shots being fired.

The lock down was lifted several hours later.

Sighting: Police officers are seen running at the scene of a report of a gunman seen on the University of Arizona campus on Friday night

Numerous officers responded to the scene, said Sgt. Juan Alvarez, with some surrounding streets closed off.

Tuscon police officers could be seen positioning themselves along the Modern Languages building walls, their weapons drawn.

A text alert sent to students and staff at 5:07 p.m. instructed them to stay away from the area.

'There was a report of a man with a rifle inside of the Administration Building. UAPD and TPD jointly responded and secured the area,' an updated text alert at 6.27pm read.

‘People are advised to stay away from that area, and we’re using our UAlert and other communications systems to keep the community informed of the situation.’

Alerts: As of 6.27pm the school was still warning students in electronic alerts to stay away from the Administration Building and Modern Languages building as police continue their search

Updates: The sighting has not been confirmed by police and no shots were reported fired on the Tuscan campus, seen here

Streets leading to the Administration Building were blocked, and dozens of police officers - some wearing helmets and armored vests - were seen on campus with a helicopter hovering overhead.

Alvarez said police were 'doing a floor-by-floor search to make sure there is no threat.'

'Can't say how long it will take. We are going to be thorough,' he said.

Asked if the 911 call could be a hoax, Alvarez said, 'That, we don't know. We're taking it seriously.'

A shooting at the University of Arizona's nursing school in October 2002 left three professors dead before the gunman killed himself.
