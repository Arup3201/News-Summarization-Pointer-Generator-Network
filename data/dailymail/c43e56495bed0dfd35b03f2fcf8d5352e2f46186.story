If stereotypes  are to be believed, girls like their role models soft and gentle while boys value strength and determination. But these conventions are being challenged by new research as the girls of today prove that they aren't quite as predictable as we might assume them to be.

A recent poll shows that strong, smart and gutsy characters are the role models of choice for today's 8-14-year-old girls.

When asked to pick who they would most like to be  from a list of well-known characters, feisty Katniss Everdeen from The Hunger Games and Harry Potter's clever Hermione Granger topped the list (25 per cent and 22 per cent).

When 8-14-year-old girls were asked to pick who they would most like to be from a list of well-known characters, Katniss Everdeen from Hunger Games topped the list with 25 per cent

Harry Potter's Hermione Granger, played by Emma Watson, was the second most popular role model, which illustrates that today's girls value intellect and determination

At 10 per cent and nine per cent, Matilda and Tinkerbell were less than half as popular in third and fourth place.

The survey of 1,070 girls aged 8-14 was published today by The Pineapple Lounge, the UK's fastest growing children's research and consulting firm. 

Founder of The Pineapple Lounge, Emma Worrollo says: 'These results clearly show that today's young girls are inspired by strong, sassy and courageous women.'

'Superheroes are no longer just for boys – girls too are turning to fantasy characters who accomplish amazing and daring physical and mental feats as their role models.'

When asked which celebrities they admire, 40 per cent chose gold-medal-winning Olympic athlete Jessica Ennis

The Duchess of Cambridge, known for her beauty but also her charity work (seen right meeting a sick young girl in Canada), came second in a list of celebrities that girls want to emulate

Today's 8-14-year-old girls prefer the fierce determination and survivalist instincts of characters like Katniss and Hermione Granger. 

'This Christmas, parents may find themselves going beyond the traditional 'girly' requests for presents and searching instead for dynamic gifts like Goldie Blox, Nerf Rebelle, Kindle, Xbox Kinect and Zoella's first novel, Girl Online, that make their young daughters feel smart, empowered and help them build skills for life,' adds Worrollo.

Girls were also asked which celebrities they would most want to emulate. Olympic athlete Jessica Ennis topped the bill at 40 per cent followed by Kate Middleton at 32 per cent.

At 10 per cent and nine per cent, Matilda (left) and Tinkerbell (right) were less than half as popular in third and fourth place as winners Katniss and Hermione

More predictably, pop-stars Ariana Grande and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini were in third and fourth place at 23 per cent and 21 per cent respectively.

Reflecting on what the results say about what matters to girls today, Worrollo concluded: 'While Katniss is noted for her physical strength and independence, Hermione's asset is her intellect – and it's hugely encouraging to see today's young girls aspiring to these qualities. 

'One trait common to both fantasy characters is a strong sense of loyalty and duty, an attribute which is also associated with both Ennis and Middleton. 

'This common theme suggests that today's little girls expect their role models to have both style and substance by the bucket load.'
