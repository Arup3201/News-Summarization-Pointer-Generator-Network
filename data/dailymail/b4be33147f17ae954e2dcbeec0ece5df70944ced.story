Manchester City know they can ill-afford any sort of slip as they set off for Rome. 

Forget Chelsea, Manchester United and even Bayern Munich; the Stadio Olimpico is the scene of Manuel Pellegrini's most important night of what has been an indifferent four months.

Not since the Premier League champions dispensed of Aston Villa in May – an evening etched with nerves – on their way to the title have City had so much riding on a 90 minutes. But there was steely focus in the eyes as they embarked on the Italian capital.

The good news is that David Silva - out of action since defeat in Moscow in October - has travelled with the squad alongside Vincent Kompany and Stevan Jovetic. 

Pablo Zabaleta is ready for what lies ahead.  

'Always Rome is a great atmosphere, and especially for this game because they have the same points. Also for them to go through in the competition would be massive,' he said. 

'As a player it is one of those games you really enjoy playing. You are playing against a top team and always the atmosphere there is just fantastic as well. It will be huge.

'I think the Champions League is the competition at the moment where we are not performing good enough, although it is true that the draw has always been difficult for us and we are a team that are learning about a lot of things. The Champions League is that competition where you play against the best teams from Europe and if you make mistakes you are out of it.

'I think Rome is a crucial game for us to show that we want to continue in that competition and we want to go far. The quality is there to do this and hopefully we can have a great game and go through.'

The victory against Pep Guardiola's Bayern a fortnight ago was staggeringly intense and of great significance, but Wednesday's trip to Rome is that bit bigger.

With the wealth of quality at his disposal, for Pellegrini not to reach the Champions League last-16 would be unthinkable; it could mark his eventual demise as the club's manager.

And they are so close, knowing a win at Roma would seal a spot for the second reason running. If they weren't to achieve the minimum requirement of progression, the failure would not be down to this week but those preceding it.

The pressure is now intensified. But City save their very best to last. Think Bayern at the Etihad, QPR on that final day.

They will have to do it without Sergio Aguero this time, however, who left the field in tears on Saturday evening as they beat Everton. Easier said than done.

Nineteen goals already this season – including two late on against the Germans to keep their European hopes alive – goes a long way in pointing towards the Argentine's importance. He will undoubtedly be a miss, but these City players know the importance of reaching the knockout stages. Their careers in the North West depend on it. 

'Let's be honest, we need to do something or otherwise next year it's going to be new players, it's going to be everything,' said Samir Nasri ahead of the win against Bayern. 'That's how it works when you play for a big club. With the salary of every player and the level of those players, 90 per cent of the team is world class.

Jovetic is likely to start up front for Pellegrini's Premier League champions in Rome on Wednesday 

The Montenegrin completed his sprinting drills at the back of the queue on Tuesday morning  

'Then not to qualify from the first round of the Champions League would be a huge blow for the club — and for us as well. With the players we have and everything, the owner gives us his trust, we have to return it in the Champions League. It's the perfect scene to show we can compete with the best team in the world.

'We have a chance to play for a big club and we are treated the right way. Sometimes it's not good to talk too much, it's better to talk with your feet. We have leaders in the squad and the manager talks a lot as well. So stop talking.'

The talking stops on Wednesday, and don't bet against City coming out of Italy with the result they need.
