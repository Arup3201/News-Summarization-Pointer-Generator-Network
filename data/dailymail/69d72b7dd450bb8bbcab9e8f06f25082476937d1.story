Flat pack shelters that take just 30 minutes to assemble have been designed to help save lives during natural disaster.

When earthquakes, storms, floods, forest and bushfires and landslides hit a region, one of the problems faced by rescue and humanitarian services is providing a safe place to treat the wounded and provide shelter for those who have lost their homes.

With this in mind, Argentinian architecture studio Proyecto 2M has developed Modularflex disaster shelters, which can be packed flat for easy storage, and built in just half an hour, reports io9.com

The shelters feature electrical points and even in-built LED lighting

The folding design means it can be assembled by two man teams or, for ease and speed, simply 'popped-up' using a crane. They also have a hinge that allows them to be collapsed like accordions.

The company says the shelters are lightweight, flexible and sturdy and, when folded flat and not in use, packed six to a group on the back of a truck, meaning they can be transported easily and efficiently to wherever they are needed most, without needing unwieldy heavy machinery.

The walls are made from insulated 
thermal panels, similar to a supermarket cold storage room, and can 
withstand temperatures ranging from -20C° to 49C°.

The modular design means that a number of the shelters can be used to create larger dwellings with as many doors and windows as needed. Each model also comes with electrical wiring and LED lights.

They also come in different designs, such as camouflage for the military or a red cross for humanitarian efforts.

The Modularflex was launched last year at an Expo in Buenos Aires and the creators are currently in negotiations with mining companies to provide housing for workers as well as the Argentine armed forces.
