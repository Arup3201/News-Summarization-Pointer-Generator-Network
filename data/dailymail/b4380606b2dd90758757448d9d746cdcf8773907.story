A retired hockey star who is suffering from a terminal heart condition has seen is dying wish granted after hundreds of fans gathered outside his Vancouver hospital to chant his name - 'Gino! Gino!'

Gino Odjick was the rough-and-tumble enforcer for the Vancouver Canucks during his eight seasons with the team starting in 1990. Now, at age 43, is he fighting AL amyloidosis, a disease that is causing his heart to harden with protein deposits.

He says doctors have given him only a few months, even weeks, to live.

Up to 500 people attended the rally in Odjick's honor, shouting 'Gino! Gino!' so loudly he could hear them from the fourth floor of the hospital

Odjick has been given as little as a few weeks to live after being diagnosed with a disease that is hardening his heart

When he announced the heartbreaking news in a letter on the Canucks' website last Thursday, he added this aside: 'During my career I played in some great NHL cities including, Vancouver, Long Island, Philadelphia and Montreal. In my heart, I will always be a Canuck and I have always had a special relationship here with the fans.

'Your "Gino, Gino" cheers were my favourite. I wish I could hear them again. You have been amazing.'

The fans responded. On Sunday, hundreds gathered outside Vancouver General Hospital and began chanting his name - 'Gino! Gino!'

Odjick heard them. All the way from his fourth-floor hospital bed.

He came down to greet his adoring public - wheeled out by his families.

Suddenly, he surprised everyone and stood and waved to his adoring fans.

'I really appreciate you guys coming. It means a lot to me,' he told his fans.

Odjick wrote that he he would love to hear fans chant his name one last time in a note revealing his disease. His fans responded

'It's pretty amazing. I'm a little bit overwhelmed, and really touched.'

One woman in a No 29 Odjick jersey carried a sign that said 'Will you marry me 29!' She had carried it to a Canucks game to watch Odjick more than 20 years ago, the Vancouver Sun reports.

'He has always been a very tough fighter. This has been the hardest battle he’s had so far, and he’s ready to fight this. And for all of these people to come out and being chanting his name, really helps him,'

Many of the supporters who showed up were from Canada's First Nations tribes. Odjick was born on an Algonquin in Quebec. On the ice, he was a high-profile First Nations star.

'He was one of us. He showed us what a person with heart and dedication can do no matter insurmountable odds,' Stanley Jones, a member of a First Nations tribe, who come out to see Odjick told the National Post.

Odjick was known as an enforcer and a fighter in his eight seasons with the Vancouver Canucks in the 1990s
