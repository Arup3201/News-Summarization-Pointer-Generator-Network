Jailed: Lee Wilkinson, who was jailed for 11 months at Newcastle Crown Court after biting off the finger of Michael Dent during a nativity play at Harton Primary School in South Shields, Tyne and Wear

A man bit off the tip of a love rival's finger at a children's nativity play after a long-running feud.

Father-of-three Lee Wilkinson, 40, attacked Michael Dent during the festive performance after Mr Dent had an affair with the attacker's wife while he was working away from home.

When the men saw each other at Harton Primary School, South Shields, they became embroiled in an angry verbal confrontation.

A fight broke out, during which Mr Dent, 33, put his hand in Wilkinson's mouth, who then 'bit hard' on the finger.

Wilkinson was sentenced to 11 months in prison at Newcastle Crown Court, after the judge said that he had 'used his mouth as a weapon'.

The court heard how Wilkinson had been working offshore when Mr Dent started a relationship with his wife, Louise.

When the relationship 'became serious', Wilkinson separated from his wife, which resulted in a 'large amount 
of animosity and hostility'.

The pair had already fought each other on two previous occasions.

Bridie Smurtwaite, prosecuting, said: 'They both attended the school, with Mr Dent arriving in the queue behind the defendant.

She told the court how scientific expert Mr Cooper had believed ‘this injury must have required severe force.’

His report went on to say how ‘the injuries caused were consistent with the jaws going up and down on the tip of the victim’s finger and one of them would have had to pull with some force to cause the tip to have become separated from the rest of the finger’.

Wilkinson, from South Shields, pleaded guilty to unlawful wounding and a separate public order offence relating to a run-in between the two men on Christmas Eve in 2011, at an earlier hearing.

Affair: The court heard how Mr Dent, pictured, and Wilkinson had fought on two previous occasions after Dent began a relationship with Wilkinson's wife

Miss Smurthwaite told the court how the pair had previously fought on two earlier occasions, and Dent was cautioned by police at both times.

She said: 'On the first occasion, on 19 November 2010, Dent had been at his ex-wife’s house, when he saw Wilkinson in the conservatory.

'He believed that he heard Wilkinson talking about him so he went into the conservatory and assaulted him.

On the second occasion in August 2011, Dent attacked Wilkinson outside the Glitterball night club in South Shields as he began to walk home.

The pair fought in the street and after police were called, Dent was again cautioned for assaulting Wilkinson.

In a statement taken by police, Dent said: 'I’m worried about bumping into him in the street. I would have to claim compensation as I am a full time scaffolder and will be unable to work for some time.

'It has caused a great deal of upset for my children.'

Tom Moran, defending, said: 'The background to these two men goes back a long way. While working as a taxi driver in February 2008, he was assaulted by a passenger who was not prosecuted.

'He had to have plastic surgery to the inside of his mouth after it was prized open during the attack.

'After being unable to work for some time he then took on a job in the North Sea, which sees him work all year round and means he is often away for up to three weeks at a time.

Weapon: Judge Simon Hickey, sitting at Newcastle Crown Court, pictured, told Wilkinson that he had 'used his mouth as a weapon'

'During one of the occasions he was away, his wife Louise, who he has three children with, started a relationship with Mr Dent.

'This was a relationship that became serious and the two separated and she set up home with Mr Dent.

Judge Simon Hickey sentenced Wilkinson to 11 months imprisonment, 10 months for unlawful wounding and one month for a public order offence.

The judge said he had taken into account Wilkinson’s early pleas, the two earlier offences for which Dent had been cautioned for, his clear work ethic, and for the fact Dent was having an affair with his wife.

Judge Hickey told Wilkinson: 'You were both attending a nativity play at a local school. 'You both moved, as can be seen for the footage, into the foyer away from the children and I saw females of all ages in the area where you started to scuffle.

'It’s reassuring to see that you do not have any previous convictions for violence, you were a man of good character previous to this matter.

'The victim was spared any reliving of this offence as you pleaded guilty immediately. It was while you were away at sea to provide for your children that this man began an affair with your wife.

'It is in my judgement that if someone loses the tip of their finger, they will have the reminder of this throughout the rest of their life.

'It must be remembered that in this case you used your mouth as a weapon.'
