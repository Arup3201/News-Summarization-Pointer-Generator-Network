After months of planning, Rotterdam's sci-fi-looking fruit and vegetable market has just opened its doors, offering tourists and residents the chance to grocery shop in style.

Markthal is actually a combined food hall and apartment complex that houses 228 units, as well as 100 market stalls underneath its brightly-decorated archway. But it doesn't stop there.

The market also offers a unique co-working space, where entrepreneurs can rent out space, as well as extensive underground parking, restaurants and a cooking school. 

Rotterdam's Markthal food hall, which looks like a spaceship, has just opened its doors to the public

The horseshoe-shaped building has a brightly decorated archway and space for 100 food stalls

It was designed by Dutch firm, MVRDV, the market is a key part in the rejuvenation of Binnenrotte Square, in the up-and-coming Laurens district.

Informally known as the 'Horseshoe,' the impressive space is also the country's only indoor food market, as its encased at either end by glass walls.

This comes on the heels of new government regulations that require produce retailers to be completely under cover. 

According to the website, this stunning architectural achievement is inspired by similar food hall concepts around the world and hopes to be a destination for those visiting Rotterdam.

It's a 'market where shopping is an experience and where you can go to enjoy a drink or grab a bite to eat.' 

The complex also offers 228 apartment units available to rent and a co-working space for entrepreneurs

The Markthal website says: 'Some 100 fresh produce units will form the heart of Markthal Rotterdam.

'There is space for approximately 60 entrepreneurs from a wide variety of food sectors.

'Passionate entrepreneurs, local heroes, but also established names from all over the country. Entrepreneurs who believe in the concept and hard workers who distinguish themselves with their fresh produce.' 

As well as fresh fish and poultry, shoppers will be able to buy cheeses, coffee, vegetables and fruit. There's also a crockery and a wine shop.
