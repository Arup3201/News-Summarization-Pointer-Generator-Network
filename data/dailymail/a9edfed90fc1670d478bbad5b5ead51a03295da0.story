They appeared to have been given a taste of the high life that most of us can only dream about.

But when X Factor fans saw this year's hopefuls travelling first class during trips to Bermuda, Mexico and Los Angeles for the Judges' Houses stage of the competition, all was not as it seemed.

According to one source connected to the ITV talent show, the young singers only enjoyed a fleeting moment in the coveted British Airways cabins.

Despite being seen toasting each other with champagne in the luxury surroundings as they jetted off, the young singers were then said to have been sent back to their economy-class seats as soon as filming had finished.

An insider told The Daily Mirror: 'The singers were summoned from the rather less salubrious confines of economy to sit in the first class seats and told to make out they were having a lovely time for the cameras.

'Champagne bottles were popped and they were all told to laugh and joke around as if they were having the time of their lives.

'But no sooner had they settled in and sipped some of the champers, they were told to get back to their seats in economy once filming duties were complete.'

A spokesman for the X Factor declined to comment of the allegations. 

The episodes, which were shown earlier this month, showed Simon Cowell and his fellow judges including Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, Mel B and Louis Walsh, picking the 16 finalists to appear in the show's live finals.

Simon Cowell and his sidekick Sinnita flew to Los Angeles, while Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and rapper Tinie Tempah filmed in the south of France, and Louis Walsh was joined by former judge Tulisa in Bermuda as the judges were tasked with choosing their favourite three acts to compete in the live finals of the programme.

The finalists have since moved in a £2.8m mansion with a gym and pool in the north London suburb of Enfield.

The mansion is furnished in French antique style with lots of cream carpets throughout and huge beds.

The news comes after an earlier controversy when it was reported last week that the X Factor wannabes had caused chaos on-board a BA flight back to Gatwick, following their performances at Mel B's house in Mexico.

According to fellow passengers, they enjoyed so many of the free drinks during the flight that airline staff had to close the bar.

The male contestants, who were travelling from Cancun after performing at the Spice Girl's pad, allegedly made so much noise on the night flight, stewards were forced to get involved.

It is claimed that passengers were left disgruntled by the rowdy antics and the men 'knocking back drinks like they were going out of fashion'.

The six contestants had been banned from drinking during the six days they spent at Mel B's house - where they performed in front of the Spice Girl and sidekick Emma Bunton.

However, passengers said the singers made up for it on board the British Airways flight – a claim that representatives for the X Factor and British Airways have strenuously denied.

Last month it was revealed that last-minute breaks to Las Vegas has soared by 100 per cent after it was suggested that Simon Cowell would host the Judges' Houses round of the competition here.

Louis Walsh chose Bermuda as the location for his Judges' House on this year's series of the X Factor

Sin City was leaked as the music mogul's chosen base weeks before the episode was screened and actually filmed at his home in Los Angeles.

As a result, Lowcostholidays said they had seen a sharp increase in holiday bookings, although the other Judges' Houses hotspots didn't fare so well.

While Cheryl Fernandez-Versini chose her new husband's country of origin as a destination to train up her protegees, it seems she hasn't inspired many viewers.

While Las Vegas saw a 100 per cent increase in bookings in the days following the leak, Nice has seen no increase at all.

In contrast, the Mel B effect has given holidays in Cancun, on Mexico's Caribbean coast, a 10 per cent boost.

But Bermuda has only seen a single digit increase since it was revealed as Louis Walsh's destination of choice.
