They left it late again, very late, but Arsenal took more than they arguably deserved from a Premier League game for the second week running, Olivier Giroud in this case scoring the 90th minute goal that earned them a point.

Everton’s Seamus Coleman and Steven Naismith had put the hosts 2-0 ahead in the first half, a score that stayed that way until the 83rd minute, when Aaron Ramsey pulled one back and set up this unlikely comeback.

It will feel like a defeat to Everton and their supporters for a few days yet.

To Arsenal and their travelling fans, who celebrated lustily at the end, it will feel like a win. Certainly this demonstrated backbone, and that, allied with Arsenal taking their unbeaten run in all competitions to 11 games, can do nothing but boost confidence.

‘We gave a great response with complete desire to come back, and the spirit was fantastic … we got a point and it was deserved,’ said Arsenal’s manager Arsene Wenger.

He added that Everton’s goal - which replays showed to be offside, just - was ‘difficult to swallow. But we took it on the chin.’

The key tactical change that ultimately made the difference was replacing Alexis Sanchez, up front in the first half, with Giroud in the second. Wenger admitted Arsenal ‘looked more dangerous’ with the Frenchman instead of his Chilean team-mate but insisted Sanchez will find his form when fully fit. ‘He’s not completely ready physically,’ Wenger said. ‘But I’m not worried for him … when he’s at his best physically he’ll come back [to form].’

Wenger’s counterpart Roberto Martinez said: ‘For 75 minutes we gave a perfect performance … dynamic going forward, defending well … scoring two should have been enough … the disappointment was the result.’

The Spaniard, who said much the same last week after Everton drew 2-2 at Leicester, added: ‘How we can get our performances to be 90 minutes long [is crucial] … the performance overall against a very good Arsenal side was good.’

Arsenal last lost a competitive match on 6 April on this ground, 3-0 to Everton. Between then and Saturday, they won six straight Premier League games, an FA Cup semi-final and final, the Community Shield, and also drew away in midweek in the Champions League.

Martinez made two changes from Leicester last week. Coleman, fully fit after injury, returned at right-back in place of John Stones. Kevin Mirallas returned in place of Aiden McGeady and played in an advanced left-sided berth in a three-man attack with Naismith to his right and Romelu Lukaku right of that.

It is no secret among Everton fans that to make a sustained challenge on the top four they need to improve considerably against the ‘bigger’ teams in general, home and away. But Arsenal have grave concerns of their own when playing against top-five teams. As well as losing 3-0 in this fixture last season, they were thrashed 6-0 and 6-3 at Chelsea and Manchester City respectively and were caned 5-1 in [italics] that [off] drubbing across Stanley Park at Liverpool that set the red team from Merseyside on their tilt at the title.

Arsenal did not win an away game against any of the teams finishing in the top five in the 2012-13 season, or in the season before that. It was a long ago as October 2010 that Arsenal last beat a team who finished in the top five, when they beat City 3-0.

Against their serious rivals, road trips have become simply bad trips. At least Saturday's had a pleasant comedown.

Wenger made five changes to the starting XI who squeaked past Crystal Palace 2-1 in added time last week. They lined up ostensibly 4-1-4-1 with Mathieu Flamini the defensive shield, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Mesut Ozil on the right and left flanks of the midfield four, and Jack Wilshere and Ramsey dropping back to assist Flamini or pushing on in support of lone forward Sanchez as the situation required.

Everton’s opener started with a set piece that went via Barry, Osman and Leighton Baines back to Barry, whose diagonal cross was headed home at the far post by Coleman, who breezed far to easily past his ‘marker’, Ozil.

The hosts could easily have been further ahead three minutes later, Naismith feeding the ball to Mirallas, who punched it down with his chest and ran clear on goal. Just as he was about to shoot his left leg slipped enough to unbalance him significantly and his miscued his effort, which went wide.

The manner in which the hosts extended their lead summed up the first half, Lukaku breaking forward and getting past Mertesacker far too easily before sliding the ball to the central Naismith. Replays showed him to be offside, but not by much and evidently not enough for the referee or his assistant to spot it, and the Scot finished the move through Wojciech Szczesny’s legs.

Wenger took Sanchez off at half time, replacing him with Olivier Giroud in search of a focal point up front. His first contribution was to lash a volley over from Ramsey’s chipped supply and he had further shots wide and saved.

Arsenal scored what looked like a consolation with seven minutes remaining, Ozil passing to Cazorla on the left, who weaved forward and crossed for Ramsey to convert. A long ball and a Monreal cross then set up Giroud at the end.

That's pants: Giroud pulls down his shorts after missing a chance but he was to make amends late on
