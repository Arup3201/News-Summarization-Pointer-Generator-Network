Fewer rapists are being brought to justice because of cuts to police forces, Labour has claimed.

Despite a massive increase in the number of cases reported to police, fewer arrests are being made and both prosecution and conviction rates have fallen.

Figures obtained under Freedom of Information laws show that recorded rapes soared by 30 per cent between 2011 and 2014 – but the number of arrests fell by eight per cent.

The 32 of Britain’s 43 forces who replied to the request recorded a rise of almost 4,000 cases, up to 16,983 in the last year. But in the same period the number of arrests fell by nearly 1,000 to 10,710.

The proportion of reported crimes leading to a conviction fell from around one in seven to one in ten; and the number of prosecutions from one in four to fewer than one in five.

Labour MP Seema Malhotra said: ‘This is a devastating example of the justice gap created by this Government’s policies. 

'More victims are struggling to get the justice they deserve and fewer rapists are being caught.’

Ms Malhotra blamed ‘heavy cuts’ to specialist police units and claimed the Government planned further reductions next year – which she promised Labour would reverse.
