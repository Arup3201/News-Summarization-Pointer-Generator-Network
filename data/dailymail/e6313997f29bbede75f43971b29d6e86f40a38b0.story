A 15-month old girl was shot dead by accident yesterday afternoon after a stray bullet flew into the apartment where she lived.

Tiny Sanai Cunningham was killed by a shot fired from outside her home, a second-floor apartment in Irvington, New Jersey. She and her family had moved it just two days earlier.

The shot, one of several fired outside, is believed to have hit her upper torso area.

Essex County prosecutors say the shot were fired indiscriminately by hooded men as they walked down her street, spraying bullets as they went.

Her parents, who were nearby at the time, rushed her to Newark Beth Israel Hospital, where she was pronounced dead. 

At the scene a bullet hole was visible in a side wall of the building where Sanai lived, which has wooden walls. Police cordoned off the area.
