Barmy council workers painted two sets of double yellow lines down a cycle path which is too narrow for a car to squeeze down.

Motorists in Nottingham were baffled when the lines appeared down both sides of the 136cm wide lane which motorists couldn't park in even if they wanted to.

The average width of a five-door hatchback such as a Vauxhall Corsa is 174cm, so would be unable to get down the path.

Tight squeeze: The cycle lane with double yellow lines in Nottingham is just 136cm wide and is too narrow for cars to get down

Cycle lane: The path cannot fit a car down it - but the council insist the lines are needed to protect cyclists in Nottingham

However the council insist the lines are necessary to protect cyclists.

Caroline Nash, service manager for traffic and safety from Nottingham City Council, said: 'We realise how this may look peculiar to the casual observer, but we are committed to making Nottingham accessible and safe for cyclists.

'Sadly, sometimes drivers park half or wholly on pavements making it difficult for cyclists and pedestrians.

'For the avoidance of doubt and so that we can enforce the restrictions, we have placed yellow lines on both sides of the track.

'This covers the whole area from the centre line of the track all the way back to the building line.

Measured up: The lane is just 136cm wide so even a small car like a Vauxhall Corsa at 174cm wide will not squeeze down

'We hope this prevents further parking in this area and keeps things accessible for cyclists and pedestrians.'

But Tim Garratt, director of a property advising firm which faces the road, said: 'Parking in Nottingham is bad enough but this is just bonkers. Clearly anyone who could wedge a car in that gap deserves a ticket.

'But when you look I'm not even sure a smart car could find its way in there. I just think that it is rules gone mad and clearly a waste of time and money.

'People are being pushed into car parks because free areas are constantly being restricted.

'Some of the car parks are ridiculously expensive and a lot of people don't see they have any other choice but to use them.

'Parking in the city needs to be made easier or else we will start pushing people away.'

Only the world's smallest car could fit down the road - the Peel P50, which is just 99cm wide.

Narrow: This path is clearly too narrow for a car to fit down - and has been criticised by local residents in Nottingham

Tight spot: Locals have accused the council of wasting money by painting the lines down the narrow cycle path
