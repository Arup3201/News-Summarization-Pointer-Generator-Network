She's often spoken of her love of animals but the enormous Mother Goose that greeted Camilla as she arrived at a London horse show probably wasn't quite what she had in mind.

The super-sized bird towered over the Duchess of Cornwall as she gamely stopped for a chat with the actor inside, craning her neck in a bid to make eye contact.

Camilla's encounter with Mother Goose came as she paid a visit to Olympia, the London International Horse Show, a festive tradition of the Duchess' that has been going on for a decade.

During the visit, which saw her take the Royal Salute from the President's Box before presenting trophies to the winners of the Christmas Pudding Stakes, Camilla, 67, went backstage to meet performers.

These included the Ukrainian Cossacks and members of the Metropolitan Police's mounted force, who were at the show to take part in an annual activity ride.

She also stopped to pat some of the tiny steeds scheduled to take part in the Shetland Pony Grand National, which was eventually won by Mighty Mark, who, at 21, is the oldest animal ever to take part.

While Mighty Mark was less than impressed by the trophies on offer, he did get a prize of his own in the shape of a polo proffered by the horse-loving Duchess.

Camilla has had a busy few weeks and, last Thursday, threw a Christmas party for terminally ill children at Clarence House.

During the festivities, which saw the Duchess serve the children a lunch of sausages and mash, Camilla helped the youngsters decorate the Christmas tree with strings of dried apple.

She also persuaded her assistant equerry, Captain Fred Lloyd George, to turn up in full uniform - including a bearskin hat - and give the delighted children a salute.

Next week will see the Duchess join the Prince of Wales and the rest of the royal family at Sandringham for the traditional Christmas celebrations.

She will also be part of the group, along with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, to take part in the annual Christmas Day service at the estate's church.

The Queen has already arrived at the Norfolk estate and was pictured getting off the train at Kings Lynn station yesterday. 

Sandringham has been owned by the royal family since 1862 when it was purchased by Queen Victoria at the request of her son Edward, then Prince of Wales.

Since then, the house has been in continuous use by the royal family and it was there that King George VI died on the 6th February 1952.

It is also from Sandringham that the Queen's annual Christmas speech is broadcast, usually uncontroversially, although this year looks set to change all that.

Bookies, among them William Hill and Coral, have suspended betting on the Queen revealing abdication plans in this year's speech.

Although Buckingham Palace sources have previously said the Queen will never step down, betting was halted following a flurry of surprise wagers.

'Throughout the year there has been major speculation about the Queen's future but the gamble has really caught us by surprise,' said Coral's Nicola McGeady.

'As far as we are concerned there's no smoke without fire when bets like this come through all in succession, so we have decided to be safe rather than sorry and pull the plug on the market.'

A Palace spokesman refused to comment, but did point to the pledges made by the Queen in her 21st birthday speech in 1947.

Then, the Queen said: 'I declare before you all that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.'

In her June 1953 Coronation Day speech, she also said: 'I have in sincerity pledged myself to your service, as so many of you are pledged to mine.'

Big arrival: The Queen arrived at Sandringham for her Christmas holiday yesterday

On her own: The Duke of Edinburgh has remained in London but will join her in a few days time 

Although it is rare for British monarchs to step aside, with Edward VIII the only monarch to do so, the practice is considerably more common in Europe, where no less than four have stood down in the last two years.

2013 was the busiest year for abdications, with Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, King Albert II of Belgium and Pope Benedict XVI all stepping down.

The following Spring, King Juan-Carlos of Spain, 76, announced plans to step down on the grounds that 'I don't want my son to grow old waiting like Prince Charles'.

He formally abdicated on the 18th June, making him the fourth European monarch to do so in less than a year.

Stepping up: King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands ascended to the throne on the 30 April 2013

Despite the flurry of abdications, the Queen has always stated that she has no plans to do the same, despite being older than all of the four.

One monarch who may yet do so is Denmark's Queen Margrethe, 74, who has been on the Danish throne for 42 years and has an heir, Crown Prince Frederik, of the same age as 46-year-old King Felipe.

However, despite claims in an Australian magazine that an announcement is imminent, sources close to the Danish queen have said she has no intention of stepping down and described the reports as 'all lies'.
