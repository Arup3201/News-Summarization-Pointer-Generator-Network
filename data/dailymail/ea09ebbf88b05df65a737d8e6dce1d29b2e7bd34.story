Disppareance: Hannah Upp, 28, a Montgomery County teaching assistant was found after she was recognised by a colleague

A teacher who is thought to suffer from a rare amnesia disorder has been found safe, but with no recollection of what happened.

Hannah Upp, 28, a Montgomery County teaching assistant was found after she was recognised by a colleague a few miles away from her school and her personal belongings were found on a footpath nearby.

She went missing on Tuesday - the second time in five years - after failing to turn up at Maryland-area Montessori school where she began a job as a teacher's assistant last week.

The Facebook page Friends Holding Hannah Upp, launched after her disappearance, confirmed: 'HANNAH IS BACK SAFE. We don't know details, but we know that she is home and safe Hannah and her family are tremendously grateful for your thoughts and prayers.'

Ms Upp also went missing in 2008 - she went for a jog near her apartment, and three weeks later, was found by a ferry crew floating in the Hudson River.

'I went from going for a run to being in the ambulance,' Upp told The New York Times in an interview later that year.

'It was like 10 minutes had passed. But it was almost three weeks.'

Experts have suggested Upp may suffer from an amnesiac disorder known as Dissociative Fugue.

This illness, which is considered extremely rare, means that a patients’ memory loss is characterized by a sudden bout of amnesia.

Dissociative fugue is considered to be an extremely rare condition.

A person suffering from the condition can unexpectedly travels far from home or work and leaves behind a past life.

They usually show signs of amnesia and do not understand or know why they have fled. 

The condition is usually associated with severe stress or trauma.

Because a suffered can not recall all or parts of their life, they can become confused.

The American Psychiatric Association (APA) classifies disassociative fugue as one of four dissociative disorders,Source: Mind disorders 

Dr. Daniel Schacter, a professor of psychology at Harvard University who has researched dissociative fugue cases told Yahoo Shine.

'Almost by definition, patients in a dissociative fugue state are not aware of who they are, so you have to wait until they come out of that state of amnesia before looking at their experience and what happened.'

But some people are sceptical about the disorder.

'I've never seen it,' Dr. Antonia Baum, a psychiatrist in the Montgomery County town of Somerset told WUSA9.

'I've been in practice a good long while. It is that uncommon.'

'When you start to see a pattern like that, you really start to wonder, 'OK, what's going on with this person?' said Dr Baum.

'I would be looking for things with a cyclical tendency. Bipolar disorder or underlying personality disorder or substance abuse or seizure disorder.'
