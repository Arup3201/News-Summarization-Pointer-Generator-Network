Hunt supporters are threatening to withdraw backing from the Conservatives at the next election unless ministers act to ease the hunting ban.

As more than 250,000 people across the country gather for the traditional Boxing Day meets, supporters are said to be ‘exasperated’ by the Tories’ failure to see through a pledge to hold a Commons vote on scrapping the ban.

Many of those taking part in events on the biggest day of the hunting calendar are likely to be children – some as young as five – reflecting the growth of a new generation of supporters spurred on by the ban.

The Countryside Alliance said hunts 
had attracted increasing numbers of children since the sport’s profile 
was raised by the 2004 Hunting Act that banned hunting foxes with a pack
 of hounds.

Membership
 of the Warwickshire Hunt has more than doubled since the ban to more 
than 1,000 members, with children as young as five attending regular 
meets.

Sam Butler, the 
hunt’s chairman, said: ‘There are more people taking part now than 
before the ban. We have seen a marked increase in children coming along 
with their parents or minders.’

Most
 of the gatherings practise trail-hunting, where huntsmen follow a trail
 across the countryside laid with a rag steeped in fox scent. 
Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has dismayed the hunting community 
by indicating there is no imminent prospect of the Tories delivering on 
their manifesto pledge to hold a vote on repealing the hunting ban.

Mr
 Paterson has pointed to the fact that many Lib Dems, and some Tories, 
do not support repeal, adding: ‘There’s only a point having a vote if 
you’re going to win.’ But he is also accused of prevaricating over a 
plan to ‘relax’ one element of the ban, which supporters say would help 
control fox numbers.

Mr
 Paterson has now been warned that he needs to make it clear by the end 
of next month that he will deliver on the issue, or face the potential 
desertion of hunt supporters at the election.

Tory
 MP Simon Hart, a former chief executive of the Countryside Alliance, 
acknowledged that the patience of rural supporters was wearing thin.

He
 said hunting was one of a number of factors fuelling ‘disgruntlement’, 
along with issues like planning reforms, wind farms and HS2.

He
 said: ‘If you are a rural voter and activist who turned out to help in 
2010 with a spring in your step for the new dawn the Conservatives were 
promising, do you still feel the same way? No, you don’t, and there is 
only so much you can blame the Lib Dems for.’

Mr
 Paterson and Mr Cameron have both publicly voiced support for the idea 
of a small relaxation in the hunting ban, which would allow farmers to 
use a pack of dogs to flush a fox from cover before shooting it.

One
 senior figure in the hunting community said: ‘Our people have had a 
bellyful. We’ve had lots of sympathy and warm words from ministers, but 
they haven’t actually lifted a finger to help us. We want this relaxation and it is completely deliverable if they show a bit of leadership.’

Charlotte Outram, 39, and her children Lily, seven, and William, 11, are all involved with the  Barlow Hunt in Derbyshire. Mrs Outram said: ‘They love it – they want to go out as often as they can. It is a family day out.’

Jack Wingfield-Digby, who runs the Hunting Stock Market selling hunting clothes and equipment in Sturminster Newton, Dorset, said: ‘We have been providing more and more for children – from about the age of eight upwards.

‘With our local hunt, the Blackmore and Sparkford Vale, I know there is a tremendous amount of children out, many more then I remember from when I was young.’

Charlotte Cooper, of the Countryside Alliance, said the ban needed to be scrapped because no fewer foxes were being killed now than before it was introduced.

She said: ‘They get shot by farmers as they still have to reduce the number of foxes out on the land. We believe hunting is a very humane and natural way to get rid of them.’ While welcoming the surge in support for the sport, she said hunting was different than before the ban.

‘It is now much more predictable – it takes out the element of not knowing what is going to happen,’ she said.
