From the heady heights of Christian Dior's New Look to the delicate creations of current creative director Raf Simons, Dior has been wowing the fashion world for more than 60 years.

Now some of the most beautiful pieces from the archives of the fashion house have been brought together in a spectacular new book, Dior: The Legendary Images.

But it's not just fashion. The glamorous tome also includes some of the most iconic photographs ever taken, with contributors including Helmut Newton, Richard Avedon and Cecil Beaton.

Also included are photographs taken by Horst P. Horst, a legendary American fashion photographer who is set to get his own retrospective at the V&A later this year.

But before that opens, there's Dior's own exhibition which charts more than half a century of photography starring pieces by the fashion house and opens on 3rd May at the Musée Christian Dior in Granville, France.

Highlights, many of which appear in both the book and the exhibition, include stunning shots by Norman Parkinson, the fashion photographer who succeeded Cecil Beaton as official snapper to the royal family, and iconic photos by Beaton himself.

Most of the photos are housed in the archives of the Musée Christian Dior, which occupies the 19th century Belle Epoque mansion where Dior grew up.

Along with a revolving roster of temporary exhibitions, the museum also houses a permanent collection of Dior couture and is home to a fabulous English-style garden created by the designer's mother, Madeleine.

Commenting on the forthcoming book and exhibition, Sylvie Lécallier, head of photography at the Palais Galleria in Paris, said:

'Starting as sketched-out lines that the couturier drew in private, Dior’s dresses became photographic images inscribed in our collective memory.'

Dior: The Legendary Images, edited by Florence Miller and published by Rizzoli, is released on 29th April and costs £40
