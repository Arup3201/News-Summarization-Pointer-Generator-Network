A suspected carjacker has been caught on video stealing a vehicle from outside a luxury Miami hotel before hitting four people and slamming into other vehicles as he tried to escape. 

CCTV footage from the outside the entrance of the five-star J.W. Marriott Marquis Hotel shows Alberto Ruiz getting into the Lexus RX 350, getting into a car and knocking two valets to the ground.

After reversing into the pair of attendants, who were unloading the driver's shopping at the time, the 50-year-old tries to drive off.

He then gets into the car and closes the door behind him while the driver is standing outside the vehicle holding a set of silver balloons

He then slams into the car in front of him while a woman holding silver balloons, grabs hold of the door handle in a bid to stop him.

However he pushes her out of the way and continues to try and drive away from the scene. 

As he slowly moves towards the exit of the parking lot, security guards run to the car and open the door, attempting to get him out.

However he starts a fight with one of them, reverses again and then  drives, hitting two people while others in front of him dive out of the way.

Two hours after the incident Ruiz was caught at a motel a mile away from the scene. According to the Miami Herald, officers saw the badly-damaged Lexus in the parking lot. 

Police said he resisted arrest, forcing officers to use a stun gun, and was then taken to hospital.

Four people hit by the car were taken to Jackson earlier in the day. One was in serious condition at the hospital’s Ryder Trauma Center late Wednesday. 

Detective Rene Pimentel told WSVN: 'You can see that this individual had no regard for anyone's life. People were getting wedged, run over, pinned. He could not care less. He just wanted to take off.' 

The officer added that Ruiz is a known criminal in the downtown area and is believed to have been involved in similar carjacking incidents at nearby hotels. 

He is said to be facing multiple charges including attempted murder.  

The 50-year-old then reverses back and knocks over two valets who were putting bags onto a trolley 

He then tries to drive off but hits another parked car in front of him

Ruiz, who has a long criminal history, was caught at the Ramona Motel a mile away from the scene. Police say they had to use a stun gun on him after he resisted arrest
