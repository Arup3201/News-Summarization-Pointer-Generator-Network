Paedophile: David Cameron, who had sex with two young girls after giving them drink and drugs, has been jailed for ten years

A predatory paedophile who had sex with two young girls after giving them drink and drugs has been jailed for ten years.

David Cameron, 48, was said to have put candles and rose petals in his bathroom in an attempt to seduce one of the girls.

He was convicted by a jury of sexual activity with a 13-year-old girl when she was drunk and he had given her drugs. He also had sex with her in the grounds of a school late at night in the summer of 2009.

Cameron, of Keighley, West Yorkshire, threatened the 13-year-old that her family would come to harm if she told anyone what he had done.

He also abused a 15-year-old girl after he gave her neat vodka one night in October 2012. He followed her upstairs and had sex with her as she lay on a bed.

Both girls had to give evidence at his trial after he denied any wrongdoing.

He was found guilty of five charges of sexual activity with a child - one offence against the 13-year-old girl and the rest involving his 15-year-old victim.

At Bradford Crown Court yesterday, Judge Robert Bartfield said Cameron 'wormed his way into their confidence' and that both girls were vulnerable and had troubled backgrounds.

'She [the 13-year-old] was virtually incapable of resistance and this came as near to rape as can possibly be imagined,' Judge Bartfield said.

'They have been significantly traumatised by these events.'

After the case, PC Andy Teale, of the Bradford District Safeguarding Unit, said: 'Cameron attempted to gain the trust of his victims through association.

'He took advantage of their vulnerability, supplying them with both alcohol and drugs.

'These two young victims are now left to battle with the consequences of Cameron's depraved actions.

'The sentence really reflects the seriousness of this man's behaviour and the threat that he posed to those around him.

'I sincerely hope that the outcome will now provide an opportunity for the victims to find some closure.'

Cameron must sign the sex offenders' register for life and a Sexual Offences Prevention Order protects his victims and other young girls from him in the future.
