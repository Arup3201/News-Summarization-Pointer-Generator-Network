Boom: An extra 625,000 passengers flew in and out of Heathrow in 2012 compared to the previous year

Heathrow airport has enjoyed a record-breaking year, with the highest ever number of passengers travelling through Britain's biggest airport.

The London airport handled almost 70 million passengers last year - 0.9% more than in 2011.

The soaring passenger numbers have been driven by increased north Atlantic traffic and to the developing BRIC countries - Brazil, Russia, India and China.

Despite the record performance, airport bosses say that the airport is operating at almost full capacity airport, with lost trade costing the UK £14 billion every year.

The airport has been at the centre of a row about the the need for a new airport in the capital, with some suggesting a third runway should be built at Heathrow to deal with demand.

An extra 625,000 passengers used Heathrow in 2012 from the previous year, according to figures released by the airport.

Heightened interest in Brazil was one of the biggest factors in the increased activity, with a 21 per cent rise in traffic.

An extra 109,000 passengers travelled to or from the country that will host the 2016 Olympics and boasts one of the world's largest economies.

Fellow BRIC nation China saw traffic 
rise by 5.9 per cent, while there was a 4.5 per cent increase in 
passenger numbers to Russia.

While traffic to Africa was down 5.7 per cent and Indian traffic fell 3.4 per cent, there was growth on routes to the Middle East and Asia.

The economic situation across Europe contributed to a 0.5 per cent reduction in traffic, as routes to
Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain saw a collective passenger 
reduction of 4.5 per cent.

Greece experienced the largest 
reduction, with a fall in passenger numbers of 7.3 per cent,  followed by Italy - down 6.8 per cent.

Increase: Passengers pictured using Heathrow airport today. The number of passengers using the airport rose by 0.9 per cent in 2012, fuelled by a boom in traffic to China and Brazil

Capacity: A plane is deiced at Heathrow today as a cold snap hits the UK. Despite the record performance, airport bosses say that the airport is operating at almost full capacity, with lost trade costing the UK £14 billion every year

Offsetting this, 
German traffic increased by 2.3 per cent and France's traffic rose by 0.6 per cent.

The number of passengers using domestic within the UK rose slightly by 0.5 per cent.

The capacity of planes flying in and out of Heathrow was another record, with flights 75.6 per cent full last year, compared with 75.2 per cent in 2011.

The 2012 statistics were boosted by record December figures, with 5.6 million passing through the airport - 2.0 per cent up on December 2011.

Heathrow chief executive Colin Matthews said: 'The figures for 2012 show Heathrow is delivering higher passenger numbers despite a tough economic climate.

'At the same time passenger satisfaction reached record levels.

Study: The Davies Commission will present an interim report on the UK's airport capacity by the end of 2013. Heathrow has called for a third runway to deal with their capacity issue

'Over the next 12 months we will continue to improve the passenger experience and focus on our investment programme, as we move towards completion of the new Terminal 2.'

The government has asked a commission headed by Sir Howard Davies to advise on airport capacity needs in the UK in the future.

The Davies Commission is expected to present a report by the end of 2013, with a full report due in the in 2015.

The Association of British Travel Agents described the figures as 'positive' but added: 'The fact remains that  the airport is operating at virtually peak capacity.'

An ABTA spokesman said: 'Whilst the Government delays decisions on airport capacity the UK is losing the historic advantage as a gateway to the world and meanwhile our competitors on the continent are rushing to fill this gap.

'Airports such as Amsterdam, Paris and Frankfurt have greater number of runways, a greater capacity to recover due to adverse weather and non-existent or low taxes on air passengers.'
