Initiative: Italian computer experts have created a new website where anonymous informants and victims of organised crime can report Mafia activity

Italian computer experts have created a new website where anonymous informants and victims of organised crime can report Mafia activity.

The new site, Mafialeaks, will encourage victims, or even former mobsters, to relay information to police, anti-mafia magistrates and journalists without fear of reprisal.

Mafialeaks is aimed at people such as shopkeepers or business owners forced to pay protection money, as well as members of the public who have uncovered mafia activity and former criminals who want to spill the beans on their bosses or partners.

Based on the Wikileaks website, information provided to the site is directed through an anonymous coded network, to protect the identity of informants, and is then passed on to sources such as the police.

The volunteers behind the new site have also kept their own identities a secret in order to protect themselves against any possible retaliation from those exposed by Mafialeaks.

'There are fewer than 10 of us, with families,' one of those behind the operation told Italian newspaper La Repubblica.

'Everything we do to do with Mafialeaks we do after work, using money from our own pockets.'

A message on the website, which was down in 'maintenance mode' today, proclaimed that the purpose of the site was to collect information on mafia activity directly, with words in English reading 'if you know something, say something'.

The site is accessible to anyone, with informants making their anonymous reports to 'receivers'.

Site users are directed to one of three categories - 'whistleblowers', for those inside the mafia clans, 'victims', and 'know something', for those who have become aware mafia activity.

They are encouraged to provide documentation of their claims, such as photographs, audio clips and other data.

The information is then sent on to 'trusted persons', who will receive an alert that it has been posted. It is hoped that the list of trusted persons will include prominent law enforcement officers, journalists and anti-mafia campaigners.

Volunteers hope that the site could provide information such as the location of Mafia bosses in hiding, or those behing extortion rackets.

Origins: The Sicilian Mafia emerged in the 19th century, with activity prevalent in more prosperous areas such as the capital Palermo

However, there have been fears raised that the site could be abused by those involved in organised crime, and that mafioso themselves could deliberately give false information to confuse investigators.

Magistrate Nicola Gratteri told La Repubblica: 'Mafialeaks could be a good way of spreading a certain type of information and shattering the wall of silence.'

However, he also said it could be used to mask 'desires for vengeance'.

Also known as Cosa Nostra, which translates as 'Our Thing', the Mafia emerged in Sicily in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct.

Groups, often known as families or clans, will claim leadership of an area, usually a town or village, and operate rackets within it, using violence to punish those causing problems to their 'clients' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection.

It has been estimated that the Sicilian Mafia costs the region's economy more than â‚¬10 billion a year, and that roughly 70 per cent of Sicilian businesses pay some sort of protection money.

Politicians have also been accused of using the Mafia to buy votes during elections.
