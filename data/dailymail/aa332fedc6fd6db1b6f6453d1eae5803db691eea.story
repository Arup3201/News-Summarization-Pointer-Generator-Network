Preventive measures: Bank of England Governor Mark Carney is set to announce new rules designed to prevent a house price bubble

Measures to curb risky mortgages will be unveiled on Thursday by the Bank of England in an attempt to stop surging house prices hitting the economic recovery.

Official figures show property costs soared 10 per cent in the year to April, fuelling fears that the property bubble could burst, triggering a new financial crash.

Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney is set to respond on Thursday by announcing new rules designed to prevent a house price bubble that could burst, triggering a new financial crash.

Economists expect the Bank’s Financial Policy Committee, chaired by Mr Carney, to take steps aimed at the largest and most risky loans.

These are expected to include a new affordability test to assess whether borrowers could afford to keep up mortgage repayments if interest rates rise.

The FPC could also opt to put a cap on the size of loans relative to a borrower’ s salary, in response to a rise in the number of loans that are more than 3.5 times a borrower’s salary.

The Bank has dropped heavy hints that it could increase the base interest rate from its record low of 0.5 per cent before the end of the year.

Rock-bottom borrowing costs have encouraged people to rack up higher debts and the Bank fears that a rise in rates could spark a wave of loan defaults as people struggle to meet the increased cost of repayment.

Mr Carney is expected to tell banks to test whether borrowers could still afford to pay back the mortgages if rates were to soar to seven per cent or more.

Strict rules introduced by the Mortgage Market Review in April have already forced lenders to test how mortgage customers would cope with steep rate rises.

But while the MMR already recommends applying the seven per cent test, Mr Carney is widely expected to make the use of this threshold mandatory, or impose an even higher one.

Some analysts expect Mr Carney to go even further, by promising to impose a ceiling on the amount that people can borrow as a multiple of their annual income.

This would echo measures taken by state-backed lenders Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland, which have set a limit of four times a borrowers’ annual earnings on all loans above £500,000.

The FPC also has the power to recommend changes to the government’s controversial Help to Buy scheme, which has been the main factor driving a boost to first-time buyer lending.

The intervention comes after Chancellor George Osborne gave the FPC new powers to force banks to rein in home loans.

Both Mr Carney and Mr Osborne paved the way for action on the housing market in their annual Mansion House speeches earlier this month.

‘The Bank of England should not hesitate to use these new powers [to curb home loans] if they think it is necessary to protect financial stability’ said Mr Osborne.

Efforts to cool the property market come despite evidence showing that the MMR has already put a dampener on home loans.

Mortgage approvals for house purchases fell for a third month running in April to a nine-month low of 62,918, according to the Bank, having risen for 11 months in a row up to January.

But many forecasters expect house prices to keep rising, with the fall in mortgage approvals put down to banks taking time to adjust to the new regime laid down by the MMR.

Nationwide is due to release figures this week showing prices were up 11.2 per cent on last year during June, according to analysts at economic research group IHS Global Insight.

‘We expect house prices to increase by around 5 per cent over the second half of 2014 with gains spread across the country,’ they said.

The FPC’s decision on what to do about rising house prices has already been taken at last week’s quarterly meeting but the Committee will not flesh out the detail of its plans until Thursday.

The Committee was set up by George Osborne to prevent asset bubbles, such as a housing boom, posing a threat to Britain’s financial stability.
