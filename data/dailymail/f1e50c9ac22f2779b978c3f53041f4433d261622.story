Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant passed Michael Jordan for third on the NBA's career scoring list on Sunday night.

Bryant entered the game against the Minnesota Timberwolves needing nine points to pass the icon with whom he is often compared.

He reached the mark with two free throws with 5:24 to play in the second quarter.

'I congratulate Kobe on reaching this milestone,' Jordan said in a statement to the Associated Press.

'He's obviously a great player, with a strong work ethic and has an equally strong passion for the game of basketball,' Jordan continued. 'I've enjoyed watching his game evolve over the years, and I look forward to seeing what he accomplishes next.'

ESPN noted that Phil Jackson coached both players leading Jordan to titles in Chicago and Kobe to a dynasty in Los Angeles. 

In the coach's book, 'Eleven Rings,' he wrote that Bryant was 'hell-bent on surpassing Jordan as the greatest player in the game.'

Bryant has said Jackson's claims are overblown. 

Nike, which also has a relationship with both athletes, is releasing a special edition 'Mamba Moment' shoe online for $245 to commemorate the new standings. 

Bryant now trails only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (38,387 points) and Karl Malone (36,928) in career points.

NBA legend Jordan is widely regarded as the best player to ever play basketball

Reaction around the basketball world was swift and congratulatory of Kobe's new standing at the top. 

'Lake fans, let's tip our hats to the Timberwolves fans for giving Kobe a great standing ovation!' tweeted basketball legend Earvin Magic Johnson. 

Sports writer Dave McMenamin tweeted: 'The free throws might have been anticlimactic, but the fact he broke it in midst of 11 straight pts for LA was perfect. He's Kobe. He scores.'
