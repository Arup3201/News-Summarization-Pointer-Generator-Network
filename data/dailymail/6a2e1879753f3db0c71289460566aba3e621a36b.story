Passengers on the Asiana Airlines flight that crashed at San Francisco International Airport last month will get $10,000 in initial compensation from the airline.

This initial payment is for medical and transportation costs for the 288 surviving passengers, and the company may give more after the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board concludes it's investigation of the incident, company spokesman Lee Hyo Min said Saturday.

The company is offering the money while the investigation is ongoing so injured survivors have the money they need now - though all passengers will receive the $10,000 amount.

Consolation: Asiana pledged to give the survivors of the flight that crash landed in San Francisco last month $10,000 in initial compensation

Victims: 181 of the over 300 people on the plane were injured in the landing - but all of the survivors will get the payment regardless of medical needs

'This is a minimum payment we are offering for all passengers, regardless of whether they were injured or not,' she said.

And accepting the money does not prevent survivors from being able to sue the company in the future.

All the company is asking for is a receipt that the passengers accepted the payment. Lee said there would be no agreement attached to accepting the money.

Already a group of 83 passengers has launched a lawsuit, but against plane's manufacturer Boeing, not Asiana. Though it could be expanded later to include the airline.

Free to sue: The company said this payment will not prevent passengers from suing the airline in the future

Asiana, the second-largest airline in South Korea, will take a big financial hit from the crash. It's estimated that they will lose 20billion won.

Asiana Flight 214 crash landed at San Francisco International Airport on July 6, while coming in from Incheon, South Korea.

Three passengers were killed in the crash and another 181 of the more than 300 people were injured on the Boeing 777 passenger jet. 

So far, Lee said, the cause of the crash is still unknown.
