An investigation is underway into a natural gas explosion that damaged more 
than 40 buildings and levelled a strip club in western Massachusetts' largest city on Friday, leaving homes and businesses shattered within a three-block radius.

In all 18 people were injured, many of them emergency workers investigating a possible gas leak an hour before the explosion in Springfield, 90 miles west of Boston.

Their injuries aren't life-threatening.

Blown out: More than 40 buildings were damaged when a gas explosion levelled a gentlemen's club and blew out windows for blocks

Cordoning off the area on Saturday a preliminary finding by building inspectors reported 42 damaged buildings that house 115 residential units. Three were immediately condemned.

Investigators are still trying to figure out what caused the Friday evening blast that could be heard for miles and left a massive hole where Scores Gentlemen's Club once stood in a multi-storey brick building.

The explosion blew out windows in a three-block radius, leaving at least three buildings irreparably damaged and causing emergency workers to evacuate a six-story apartment building that was buckling, police said.

Pieces of broken glass littered streets and sidewalks. It was unclear how many residents had been evacuated. A shelter was set up at a school.

Suspicious report: Workers surveyed the damage the morning after following a report of a strong gas odour an hour before the building exploded

Miracle: Springfield, with about 150,000 residents, is the largest city in western Massachusetts prompting Lt. Gov. Tim Murray to declare it a miracle no one died

Officials had already evacuated part of the entertainment district after responding to a gas leak and odour reported about an hour before the explosion while firefighters, police officers and gas company workers were in the area filled with commercial properties and residences.

'It really is a miracle and it's an example of our public safety officials, each and every day, putting themselves in harm's way, taking what could have been considered a very routine call of an odour of gas, but they took the proper precautions,' State Fire Marshal Stephen Coan said. 'And thanks to God that they did.'

Officials also marvelled how the 5.30pm blast occurred when a day care centre next door to Scores was closed. The centre’s building was heavily damaged.

Lt. Gov. Tim Murray and Springfield Mayor Domenic Sarno were attending a tree-lighting ceremony when the explosion occurred. Sarno said some people mistakenly thought the boom was part of the holiday event.

Estimations: Residents and business owners creeped as close to the scene as they could on Saturday hoping to survey the damage while building inspectors worked to estimate which were safe to enter

Close call: A day care centre directly beside the strip club is seen with its windows shattered which remarkably was closed before the explosion erupted

Murray said it was 'a miracle' no one was killed.

Omar Fermin, manager of the Punta Cana Restaurant two blocks from the explosion site, found the floor-to-ceiling windows blasted out when he came to check on the property Saturday morning.

'It looks like an earthquake hit,' said Fermin, a native of the Dominican Republic. 'I've never seen anything like it.'

He said he was waiting for somebody to come and assess the damage. He worried the restaurant would remain closed for weeks while the owner seeks to replace the massive custom-made windows.

On Saturday anxious residents gathered at the site’s perimeter, waiting for permission to visit their buildings.

Trapped inside, dogs were heard barking loudly from inside abandoned buildings on Saturday as building inspectors fanned out across the area. One inspector said he wished he could get a ladder and permission to retrieve a dog that was barking in the upper floor of one building sealed off from residents.

Leveled: Gas company workers stand where a building once stood, which was leveled by the explosion in downtown Springfield.

Coan, the fire marshal, said his office was investigating a cause of the blast and its possible origin. The state's Department of Public Utilities was also investigating.

Sheila Doiron, a spokeswoman for Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, said the company will continue to monitor for any potential leaks within several blocks of the blast site. So far, she said, the company hadn't yet found any measurable readings.

Those injured were nine firefighters, two police officers, four Columbia Gas workers, two civilians and another city employee.

Springfield, with about 150,000 residents, is the largest city in western Massachusetts. It's known as the home of the Basketball Hall of Fame, which is not in the vicinity of the blast.

The city has been rebuilding from damage it sustained in a June of 2011 tornado.

Powerful: Glass and debris litter a street after the explosion

On Friday night, residents milled around the neighbourhood where the explosion occurred, stunned by the destruction and confused by the cordoned-off area, which grew as crews continued to search for gas leaks. The mayor warned against looting, saying police would be out in force.

Wayne Davis, who lives about a block away from the destroyed building, said he felt his apartment shake.

'I was lying down in bed, and I started feeling the building shaking and creaking,' he said.

The Navy veteran said the boom from the explosion was louder than anything he'd ever heard, including the sound of a jet landing on an aircraft carrier.

The blast was so loud it was heard in several neighbouring communities. Video from WWLP-TV showed the moment of the explosion, with smoke billowing into the air above the neighbourhood.
