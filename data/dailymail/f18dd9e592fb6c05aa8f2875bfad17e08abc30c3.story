One of America's most critically important and breathtakingly beautiful natural wonders may actually have Canadian origins.

James W. Sears of the University of Montana proposes that the mighty Colorado once fed into a 'super river' that was the ancient equivalent of a mega Mississippi that drained much of North America.

And with his proposal dawns the realization that America may actually have Canada to thank in a way for its most treasured splendor, the Grand Canyon.

Super River: A new theory by geologist James W. Sears proposes that the Colorado River once flowed into a super river called the Bell River that drained much of North America and ended in a massive delta in Canada's Labrador Sea

According to Sears, the Colorado River, which now provides water to 80 million Americans in the Southwest once flowed northeast into the now defunct Bell River.

In fact, the proposal appears to have been fueled, at least in part, by the discovery of microfossils in Canada's Labrador Sea that likely come form the American Southwest.

The scenario, which appears in the November issue of GSA Today, posits that the river actually flowed southwest, as it does now, first, but was turned northward thanks to lifting continental plates.

Eh! Sears' proposal would mean that two of America's most splendid natural wonders--the Colorado River and its surrounding Grand Canyon--have Canadian roots

Shifting plates, faulting, and volcanic activity are actually at the root what's been pushing the Might Colorado around for millions of years.

Around 16 million years ago, the the paleo-river began to be segmented by faulting a volcanism.

And until around 6 million years ago, the day's budding Grand Canyon was actually a large lake thanks to faulting that dammed the river.

After around 6 million years ago, the Colorado was cut off in Idaho by the volcanism of the Yellowstone supervolcano hot spot.

River in flux: The super river persisted until around 6 million years ago, at which point it was destroyed by the encroaching continental ice sheet. The Colorado was cut off at Idaho by the the Yellowstone hot spot after fracturing and volcanic activity shifted it to the Gulf of California, where it drains today

The lake persisted until the Colorado was finally captured by the Gulf of California, which it flows into to this day.

The resulting 'short-cut to sea level,' Sears writes, helped to increase erosion that created the Grand Canyon we know today.

So where's the Bell River?

The super river that was once the continent's largest was destroyed by encroaching ice sheets during the Ice Age.

New study proposes that the Colorado River once flowed northeast, meeting the 'Bell River,' which flowed through Canada and drained into the Labrador Sea
