Marine Le Pen would win the first round of a presidential election if it was held today, a shock poll reveals today.

The anti-Europe and anti-immigration National Front party firebrand would gain more votes than any candidate representing a mainstream party.

It comes as socialist President Francois Hollande's approval rating plunges to a record low, and opposition UMP politicians such as Nicolas Sarkozy face corruption charges.

French far-right leader Marine Le-Pen would win a French election if it was held today according to a shock poll

The IFOP poll showed Le Pen winning 26 percent of all votes in round one of the two-round election.

This compares to 17 per cent for either President Hollande, or for his expected successor a Socialist candidate, Prime Minister Manuel Valls.

Despite his growing problems within the criminal justice system, the poll suggests that Mr Sarkozy would win 25 per cent.

Marine Le Pen     - Front National -        26%

Nicolas Sarkozy          - UMP -                  25%

Francois Hollande  - Socialists -             17%

Online poll carried 
out on July 21 and 22, questioned 947 people on behalf political magazine Marianne

This would mean a head-to-head between Ms Le Pen and Sarkozy in the second round - meaning no chance of a Socialist becoming president again.

Ms Le Pen's revitalised National Front gained 25 per cent of the popular vote in European elections in May, sending shockwaves around the political establishment.

The next presidential election is in 2017, giving Ms Le Pen three years to consolidate her position.

If France's economic policies - as it has been doing since Mr Hollande came to power, then the Socialists could face electoral wipe-out.

Mr Sarkozy was this month was placed under formal investigation on suspicion of influence peddling and other corrupt activities. 

He denies any wrongdoing.

Today's
 poll is published in the political magazine Marianne. It was carried 
out on July 21 and 22, with 947 people questioned online.

Ms
 Le Pen's father, the convicted racist and anti-Semite Jean Marie Le 
Pen, came runner-up in the 2002 presidential election in France, losing 
to the UMP candidate, Jacques Chirac.

The
 hugely controversial Mr Le Pen remains a National Front MEP, but Ms Le 
Pen has pledged to make her party more acceptable to moderate voters, 
and especially women.

Polls
 consistently show that Mr Hollande is the most unpopular French leader 
in recent French history, with an approval rating currently at well 
below 20 per cent.
