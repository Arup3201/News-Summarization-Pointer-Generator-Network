This is the moment the carer for an elderly woman with Alzheimer's Disease was caught on a hidden camera stuffing stolen £10 notes into her bra.

Sarah Leacy, 33, of Putney, London, was secretly filmed stealing the money from her 90-year-old client, Monica Flanagan, earlier this year.

The victim's children Annemarie Key, Eileen Flanagan and Stephen Flanagan, had installed a small camera in their mother's home after they noticed money going missing from a secure cash box in the kitchen.  

Sarah Leacy, 33, was secretly filmed stealing two £10 notes from her client, 90-year-old Monica Flanagan

The box was kept locked with a key that was hidden in a separate location.

During both incidents, on June 13 and July 7 this year,  a £10 note was taken by Leacy.

The carer denied everything in her police interview, swearing on her 'nan and granddad's ashes' she had never taken cash out of the box.

However, Wimbledon Magistrates' Court heard Leacy completely changed her story when police told her she had been caught taking the money on film.

She then claimed she had bought milk, bread and toilet cleaner for her client and gave Mrs Flanagan the leftover change to put in her purse.

In the video Leacy is seen taking the box out of a cupboard and unlocking it with the key while making small talk with someone in another room. 

She then puts the box back in the cupboard and turns away from the camera, stuffing something into her bra before resuming her conversation.  

Giving evidence Mr Flanagan said: 'I left £30 cash in there, on June 11. A couple of days later, on June 13, I found £20 in the box.

'On July 7, again I checked the box. There was £35 in there and when I checked the box later that day £10 was missing.

'Quite a lot of material we were buying for her went missing at the time as well.'

Her children kept receipts in the box and all knew exactly how much was in there and when things had been bought for their mother.

Mrs Flanagan's children set up the secret camera in the kitchen after money started to go missing - she is pictured here taking the box out of the cupboard before she unlocked it and stole £10

Prosecutor Philip Sutton said: 'The prosecution would like to draw your attention to the fact that when Leacy was taxed about the matter she had no recollection but when she saw the CCTV there was an admission and indeed the extent of detail.

'No note was left inside the box to say 'I had to take money' or change. 

'It is unlikely on both occasions that exactly £10 was spent.'

Leacy had been Mrs Flanagan's regular carer since October 2013.

She would spend 45 minutes with Mrs Flanagan, make her a sandwich and a cup of tea and give her medication.

She told the court she only took the money to buy things for Mrs Flanagan.

When asked by magistrates why she initially denied taking money,  Leacy began crying.

She said: 'I was frightened. I was scared. My head was all over the place. I didn't know what I was saying.'

She said she had been humiliated when police arrested her in the street and added: 'I was there to help a client out. I'm not some kind of thief. I would never do that.'

Leacy was found guilty of two counts of theft on Thursday.

District judge James Henderson said: 'It seems strange to me that if the money had been taken and used quite legitimately that it would be so dramatically forgotten.

'I'm driven to conclude and I'm driven to infer it really isn't possible for the [police] interview to have progressed in the way that it did with flat denial and acceptance.

'It cannot be that was genuine forgetfulness and I'm driven to conclude Miss Leacy did steal the two amounts of £10. I find both charges proved.'

Leacy will be sentenced on Monday morning.
