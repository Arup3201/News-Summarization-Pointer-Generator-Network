So comprehensive were their victories, and so enticing a prospect, that it was difficult to resist wondering about a quarter-final meeting between Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova as they each completed demolition jobs on Thursday.

Combined, the pair lost just five games, won 108 points out of 165, and spent no more than one hour and 49 minutes on Court No 1, almost as if neither much fancied exposing their bodies to the summer chill for very long.

Williams was quicker, beating Chanelle Scheepers 6-1, 6-1 in 49 minutes — the third shortest time at these Championships — and afterwards claimed she still had improvements to make.

Not so stretching: Sharapova is made to work for a point but ran out a very comfortable winner

Focus: Serena Williams says there is more to come from her but she looked in ruthless form

The five-time champion bore the attitude of someone carrying out a tiresome household chore as she swatted the ball this way and that to send the 30-year-old South African on shuttle runs of futile purpose.

If Williams can focus her mind you imagine more challenging tasks that await will be similarly conquered.

There were trademark returns slapped back with interest and a couple of aces measuring 113mph and 115mph to entertain the crowd.

She was a prickly presence in the press conference which  followed, at one point asking when it would be over, but  perhaps that was due to lack of sleep having only finished a  doubles match with sister Venus the previous evening at 8.59pm.

Serena took a tumble into the crowd during that win — ‘I had some lovely gents able to break my fall’ — and added: ‘I felt okay today. I don’t want to feel great necessarily right now because hopefully I have several more matches I can play.

‘The goal for me is just to feel a little better every day.

Struggle: Sharapova has not won the Wimbledon title since beating Serena Williams as a 17-year-old in 2004

‘It’s important not to peak too soon, keep working on your game, always have room for improvement.

‘I feel there’s some things I still want to work on to hopefully stay in the tournament.’

Williams can equal Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova’s haul of 18 Grand Slam titles if she wins here  — her last major came at the US Open last September — and even at 32, she has a growing appetite for success.

‘It is stronger than ever,’ she said. ‘I have desire to do more.’

Sharapova is five years younger but just as experienced and  hungry.

The pair met in the Wimbledon final of 2004, which the Russian won aged only 17, but she has not lifted the Venus Rosewater Dish since.

Last year she was knocked out in the second round, falling, quite literally, to Michelle Larcher de Brito, who was then world No 131.

Runaway: Williams beet South African Chanelle Scheepers in just 49 minutes - the third fastest win this year

Timea Bacsinszky, world No 85, presented no such challenge yesterday, beaten 6-2, 6-1 as Sharapova extended her lithe limbs to reach devious angles and get speed across the grass.

With a second French Open in her bag, Sharapova is on form and a threat. But Serena’s shadow is already looming.

‘We have played each other many times,’ said Sharapova, who has a 16-2 losing record against the American.

‘I always look forward to that challenge to play against the best, try something a little bit different to get a win out there.’

First up in round three is  Alison Riske, a 23-year-old American, who has already scalped a seed here.

For Williams, it is 25th seed Alize Cornet, a French player who beat her more esteemed competitor on the hard courts of Dubai earlier this season.
