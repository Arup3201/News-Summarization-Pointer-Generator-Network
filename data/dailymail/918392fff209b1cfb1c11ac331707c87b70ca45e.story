Footage shows the moment a police officer pins down and repeatedly punches a disabled man as he resists arrest in a Brisbane shopping centre on the weekend.

The amateur video shows two police officers hold down the 20-year-old man – who has no legs - and his 18-year-old female companion as they apprehend them.

The incident took place on Saturday at Sunnybank Plaza in the Queensland capital during the city's major police operation over the G20 summit weekend.

A Queensland Police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia that police responded to a report of a theft at a liquor store at the shopping centre.

The incident took place on Saturday at Sunnybank Plaza during the city's major police operation for G20

'As a result they chased a man and a woman for a short time in the shopping centre before apprehending them,' she said.

The spokeswoman said police were still chasing details about the rest of the incident and will be providing a statement later on Tuesday.

The 20-year-old man, from Albion north of the CBD, has been charged with two counts of serious assault on a police officer, one count of common assault, one count of stealing and one count of enter premises, Nine News reported.

The 18-year-old woman, also from Albion, was charged with one count of enter premises, one count of stealing, one count of serious assault on a police officer and one count of hindering police.

Police say they responded to reports a liquor store had been robbed and a chase ensued

Both will appear in court on December 4. 

The five-minute video shows the disabled man swearing and resisting arrest. At one point the police officer holding him down appears to punch him in the ribs, while onlookers can be heard screaming.

'Oh my god, what the hell?' one woman said.

'You guys are f***wits,' another onlooker said. 

The 18-year-old woman is also seen resisting arrest, knocking into chairs and tables and crying

The 18-year-old woman is also seen resisting arrest, knocking into chairs and tables and crying.

'I'm his carer, I care for him he's disabled,' she told officers.

Later when she is pinned down she tells police: 'You are hurting me'.

At one point more backup arrives and there are six officers arresting the two people.

Sunnybank Plaza, south of the CBD, was not included in the G20 'secure zone'.
