One of the opera world's leading figures has backed a singer branded 'dumpy' and 'unsightly' by male critics.

Mezzo-soprano Tara Erraught's appearance was savaged by reviewers after she first appeared at the Glyndebourne Opera Festival in the comic opera Der Rosenkavalier.

Award-winning opera star Dame Kiri Te Kanawa has now spoken out in support of the embattled singer, who she insists is 'absolutely gorgeous'.

The Irish singer was called 'stocky' and 'unappealing' by male reviewers after performing as Octavian in Der Rosenkavalier - a male role traditionally played by a female performer.

Dame Kiri, who recently made a guest appearance in hit show Downton Abbey, insisted Miss Erraught was in fact the victim of a 'costume disaster'.

Asked what she would say to Erraught, Dame Kiri told Radio 4's Today programme: 'I’d say burn the papers, don’t listen to a single person, go and sit with friends who are absolutely lovely and love you...don’t talk about this and get on with your life'.

She also pleaded with critics 'please don’t destroy her, it’s cruel'.

Newspaper reviews of Miss Erraught's performance provoked a furious backlash after writers praised her singing but made disparaging remarks about her shape.

Rupert Christiansen of the Daily Telegraph said Miss Erraught is ‘dumpy of stature and . . . her costuming makes her resemble something between Heidi and Just William’.

And Richard Morrison of The Times, described her as ‘unbelievable, unsightly and unappealing’.

Mr Morrison later said his description of her character had been taken out of context.

Writing in today’s paper, he said he had been talking about 'the characterisation of Octavian, not the woman playing her'.

But
 he went on to say: 'Several musicians I count as close friends (yes, I 
still have a few) tell me that what I wrote would have upset greatly the
 promising young singer who took the role of Octavian. I regret that.'

Daily
 Telegraph critic Mr Christiansen said he was ‘distressed to learn that 
Miss Erraught has been upset by the hoo-ha’, but said he stands by every
 word he wrote.

He defended his review, saying he felt she had been cast ‘against type’ in a ‘principal boy’ role.

He added that Miss Erraught is ‘a very pretty girl with a delightful smile and endearing stage presence’.

Irish-born Miss Erraught's family and fellow singers have rallied around her since the attacks.

Her mother Brianain, 50, said: 'Tara has such inner strength. She takes the view that what's said is said, it’s out there now, and it would be much worse if they were criticising her singing rather than her body.

'She is getting tremendous support from everyone around her. She is a professional and is just getting on with it.

'We’ve never had to face this before. She’s been reviewed in a lot of places and there’s never been an issue like this before.'
