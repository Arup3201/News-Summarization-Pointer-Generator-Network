US Secretary of State John Kerry is concerned about the threat posed by global warming.

Speaking Monday via satellite to climate experts gathered for this week’s Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) in the Marshall Islands, US Secretary of State John Kerry asserted that climate change needs to be taken more seriously and that action can be taken to stem the tide of consequence.

The Marshall Islands, at no more than three feet above sea level, are especially at risk of rising seas, one of the many effects of global warming.

Concerned: US Secretary of State John Kerry is concerned nations aren't taking the threat of global warming seriously

‘The science is clear. It is irrefutable and it is alarming,’ Mr Kerry said via satellite from Washington, DC. ‘If we continue down our current path, the impacts of climate change will only get worse.’

Saying ‘I stand with you in the fight against climate change,’ Mr Kerry advocated strong, immediate action to limit the threats posed to infrastructure, health, the world economy and even the viability of island nations.

Mr Kerry also said it will take more than one nation to make a difference.

‘If we act together, there is still time to prevent some of the worst impacts of climate change,’ said Mr Kerry, adding that ‘the people of the Pacific Islands know as well as anyone that we also need to prepare communities for the impacts that are already being felt.’

Irrefutable: Warmer temperatures are leading to more severe weather

The former US Senator was not the only one to express worry over the future of Pacific island nations.

Speaking before Mr Kerry, European Union Climate Commissioner Connie Hedegaard said inaction will only further endanger the many low-lying nations in the Pacific. Ms Hedegaard also lamented that some countries might not honor the 2015 emissions reduction and alternative energy use deadline previously agreed to by most nations.

‘We have to make a joint pressure to say the world is already more than late,’ said Hedegard, adding that ‘2015 must be taken seriously.’

With Pacific islands not responsible for climate change planning to be in compliance with the new emissions rules, it’s difficult for other nations to justify not complying, Hedegard noted.

A dangerous tide: Rising sea levels and warmer temperatures are creating stronger storms, leaving coastal regions at higher risk

More commonplace: Flooding caused by stronger storms, such as Tropical Storm Kong-Rey, which recently flooded parts of Taiwan, will be more common in the future

A ‘Majuro Declaration,’ geared towards bringing further attention to climate change and efforts to limit its impact, is set to be finalized by PIF this week.

Tuvalu Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga argued that the situation faced by Pacific is ‘dire,’ and requires immediate action, rather than pledges that might be rolled back in the future.

'We need concrete action on the ground to save Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Kiribati,' said the worried Mr Sopoaga, adding that ‘we have to send a very strong signal out of this panel and forum that we need a legally binding agreement [on emissions].

As tropical storms become more severe and sea levels continue to rise, it is only a matter of time before many of the smaller island nations that dot the Pacific wiped from existence. Many of them sit barely above sea level, and already have residents voluntarily uprooting to safer areas.

The PIF nations will present the Majuro declaration to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon at the General Assembly meeting in New York one month from now.
