Wigan Athletic produced the biggest FA Cup Final upset for 25 years by beating  Manchester City 1-0 at Wembley yesterday with a dramatic last-minute goal.

Substitute Ben Watson was the hero, heading home from a corner just as the final looked to be heading for extra time. His goal sparked wild celebrations among the club’s 30,000 fans.

It was the first time in their history that Wigan had reached the final and their triumph matched Wimbledon’s unlikely victory over Liverpool in 1988.

Wigan chairman Dave Whelan, who broke his leg playing for Blackburn Rovers in the 1960 final,  said: ‘Fantastic! I had the  dream but I didn’t publish it. I thought we would get to the final and win 1-0 and it is repayment for me breaking my leg.’

Manager Roberto Martinez described Manchester City as a brilliant side but said: ‘We didn’t win by luck – from start to finish it was an incredible performance.’

Wigan are currently facing relegation from the Premier League, but those troubles seemed to be temporarily forgotten as the players and fans celebrated beating last season’s Premier League champions and the richest club in the 
world, backed by the oil dollars of Abu Dhabi.

The Latics had never gone beyond the quarter-finals of the competition before this season but a remarkable story ended in perfect fashion when the injury-time winner proved to be enough.

Whelan bought Wigan 18 years ago when the club were in the bottom tier of the Football League and struggling to attract crowds of 2,000. Today's 1-0 victory earned his club the first major trophy of their 81-year history.

Whelan said: 'We played so well. Manchester City are a quality side. I thought we were miles the better team. We should have had a penalty just before half-time. We had more chances and we played them off the park.

'We've only struggled in the league 
because we've had so many injuries, we've had really bad luck. We're a 
small club so it's difficult to replace those.

'You could see the pride in all of 
our supporters that we'd won the cup and will take the cup back to 
Wigan. All we want now is for the rugby league team to bring the 
Challenge Cup back to Wigan and Wigan is back on the map big style.'

There will be no celebrating just yet for the Latics, though, with their Premier League future still very much in the balance.

Three points adrift with only two 
games left, Wigan travel to Arsenal on Tuesday before a potentially huge
 game against Aston Villa at the DW Stadium next weekend.

Whelan said: 'We have unfinished 
business. We've got a match Tuesday and a match Sunday. The lads are 
going straight back, there's no celebrations. They're in training 
tomorrow. We celebrate when we stay in the Premier League on Sunday 
night.'
