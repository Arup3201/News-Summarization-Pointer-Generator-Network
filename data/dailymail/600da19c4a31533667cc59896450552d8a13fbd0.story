The World Cup is just around the corner but it seems that the England team are making headlines for more than just their football skills.

Joe Hart was unveiled as the new face of Hugo Boss fragrance, Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard acted as clothes horses for M&S and now the team's midfielder is getting in on the action.

Adam Lallana has been unveiled as the new - and first ever - face of French Connection's pre-fall line for men.

New signing: England midfielder Adam Lallana has just been unveiled as the new face of French Connection

Described by the brand as the 'poster boy for the 2014 World Cup', the launch of pre-fall aims to celebrate the invigoration of the menswear line with cleaner shapes, quality tailoring and luxurious outerwear, with a little help from 26-year-old Adam.

The collection is full of classic styles that are designed to look like they've been raided from your father's wardrobe and re-worked and updated for a more youthful look.

Finding fame: French Connection say Adam, who was voted Player Of The Year, is one to watch and will be grabbing headlines over the World Cup in Brazil this summer

Reflection: The brand say that as a player, his mix of spectacular skill and hard work is a contemporary combination while off the pitch his devotion to his family and low-key lifestyle is almost old school - much like their clothes

The new collection sees French 
Connection source fabrics from some of Italy’s most premium mills used 
by luxury fashion houses all over the world.

'This focus on the quality 
of textiles gives a sense of richness as tweeds, cashmeres, meltons and 
lambswools combine in a collection of heritage pieces recontextualised 
for the modern world,' said a spokesperson for the brand.

'Adam too reflects this - as a player, his mix of 
spectacular skill and hard work is a contemporary combination while off 
the pitch his devotion to his family and low-key lifestyle is almost old
 school and something from a bygone age in football.' 

Adam most certainly is a family man. He went as far as to wed his fiancee, formerly 25-year-old Emily 
Jubb, six months early to avoid his wedding clashing with the World Cup.

The
Southampton captain, who fathers their one-year-old son Arthur, was 
meant to walk down the aisle today but married his girlfriend of seven 
years in a £500 ceremony at Poole Register Office in Dorset on Christmas
Eve.

A source told The Sun: 'Emily totally understands. She knows it's a fantastic opportunity to play in a World Cup.

'Adam
wanted to get married but has a very hectic schedule during the season 
and didn't have time between the season ending and the call-up for 
Brazil.

'He'd booked the wedding not even thinking about Brazil - he never expected to be in contention.'

Adam has shot to fame in the sports world and won Southampton's Player of The Year last week.

A spokesperson for the brand added: 'As a key player in the mix to make Roy Hodgson’s England World Cup squad in Brazil, Adam is one of the country’s most exciting footballing talents; combined with his dedication, drive and commitment to his profession and his duties as a father, French Connection feels Adam is the perfect brand fit and a key ambassador for the pre-fall launch.'
