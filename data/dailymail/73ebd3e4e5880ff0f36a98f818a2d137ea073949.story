She may be one of the world's most scrutinised women, but you'd be mistaken for thinking Gwyneth Paltrow spends hours labouring over her looks.

The 42-year-old has revealed that she 'isn't the type' to look in the mirror and study her face and is extremely low-maintenance when it comes to getting ready.

Speaking to Stylist's Joanna McGarry about her morning beautifying routine, the A-lister said: 'I'd rather die than be studying my face. I just brush my teeth and try to get dressed and get everyone up. I don't tend to wear much make-up either.'

Low maintenance: Gwyneth Paltrow has revealed that she takes a laidback approach to beauty and would rather 'die' than study her looks in a mirror

The glamorous mother-of-two, who is getting set to launch a Goop-branded range of fashion and beauty products, also explains that she's been on a journey of self-acceptance and is happy with her looks.

She said: 'I'm pretty content with my looks at this point. I like my wrinkles and you know, I like what I see.'

Proving that she's just like the average women, Gwyneth admits that even she has down days where she feels self-critical but tries to see the positive side.

'I try to appreciate the incredible life I've lived and all I've learned. I like that all of that is written on my face.'

Acceptance: The mindful actress says she likes what she sees when she looks in the mirror and believes sleep, exercise and clean eating are key to healthy skin

Gwyneth, who advocates mindful living, credits her maturity for her relaxed approached to beauty and life and swears by sleep, good nutrition and a bit of exercise for glowing skin.

The Hollywood star, who is extremely well-connected, also reveals that her famous friends, including Stella McCartney and Cameron Diaz, are 'happy about where they are' now.

Gwyneth will be putting her beauty expertise to good use as she prepares to launch a collection on her Goop. 

The firm, which started out as the actress’ personal blog on how to live a ‘whole and healed life’, is set to launch its own range of clothing and beauty products to turn around its flagging fortunes.

Paltrow has hired American lawyer Lisa Gersh to heal the brand’s image following years of negative publicity.

Critics have mocked Miss Paltrow’s tendency to champion expensive products such as £46 homemade fishfingers, £3,000 wardrobe essentials and a £15,000-a-week holiday in her favourite French chateau.

Now, as well as giving its 150,000 subscribers tips on fashion, food and décor, it will offer them the chance to buy Goop-branded merchandise.

Miss Gersh, who is now Goop’s chief executive, told the Sunday Times: ‘The good stuff, the lifestyle advice and the travel tips, will still be there. But we will be selling our own Goop brand of clothing and beauty products online.

‘This is a chance to develop a massive new type of e-commerce company that was just not possible when I started out in the 1990s.’ 

Gwyneth  is also opening a second Goop pop-up shop in Dallas, Texas next Monday, where fans will be able to buy Christmas gifts featured on her lifestyle website.

The blonde posted a black-and-white photograph on Instagram of a glass door printed with the words: 'Goop, coming soon, Nov 17 - December 14.'
