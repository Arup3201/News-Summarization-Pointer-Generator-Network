Zenit St Petersburg hope to announce the £13m signing of Javi Garcia from Manchester City before the weekend.

The 27-year-old will undergo a medical and discuss personal terms on Thursday.

Garcia’s place among Manuel Pellegrini’s squad had been up in the air for some time given the number of foreign players they have at the club.

VIDEO Kompany commits, as City let Garcia go 

The Premier League champions had to trim two foreigners or risk paying players wages who weren’t registered to turn out for them.

The Spaniard never lived up to his billing at the Etihad Stadium since a 2012 move from Benfica.

Meanwhile, City captain Vincent Kompany has signed a new five-year contract with the Premier League champions.

Captain fantastic: City skipper Vincent Kompany has signed a new deal worth around £130,000-a-week

News of Kompany's deal, which is understood to be worth £130,000-a-week, comes just 24 hours after David Silva also committed his future to the club until 2019.

The inspirational Belgium defender has led City to the Premier League title twice in the last three years, as well as lifting the FA Cup and Capital One Cup. And Kompany, 28, has set himself a target of adding another three titles before he leaves the Etihad.

'If you win the Premier League once, you either stop there or you want to carry on and go and win 10,' he said. 'Ten is not going to happen for me, but that's the path that I've chosen.
