Put to death: John Ruthell Henry, 63, was executed in Florida at 7.43pm Wednesday for killing his estranged wife and her son in 1985 near Plant City

Florida executed tonight a convicted killer who fatally stabbed his wife and her young son in 1985.

It is the third U.S. execution in less than 24 hours since a botched April lethal injection in Oklahoma.

The governor's office says John Ruthell Henry, 63, was pronounced dead at 7.43pm Wednesday.

The inmate was convicted and sentenced to death for fatally stabbing his wife, 29-year-old Suzanne Henry, a few days before Christmas outside Plant City, Florida.

A detective testified at his trial in 1987 that Henry stabbed Suzanne in the neck with a five-inch paring knife and then watched her die while smoking a cigarette, reported Tampa Bay Times.

He also was found guilty of murdering his 5-year-old stepson, Eugene Christian, hours after the woman's murder.

The toddler was stabbed in the throat five times.

Henry previously had pleaded no contest to second-degree murder for stabbing his common-law wife, Patricia Roddy, in 1976 in front of her children, one of whom begged him to stop hurting the woman. He served less than eight years and was released in 1983.

Suzanne Henry's relatives told reporters she hadn't known about John Henry's previous killing when she married him after his release.

The U.S. Supreme Court turned down a last-second appeal by attorneys who argued Henry wasn't mentally stable enough to comprehend his death sentence.

Just before his execution, Henry asked for forgiveness and apologized for what he'd done.

'I can't undo what I've done. If I could, I would. I ask for your forgiveness if you can find it in your heart,' he said.

The state claims 
anyone with an IQ of at least 70 is not mentally disabled; testing has 
shown Henry's IQ at 78, though his lawyers said it should be 
re-evaluated.

A spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Corrections said Henry has turned down a last meal, and she described his demeanor as 'calm' before the execution.

Earlier in the day, Henry was visited by his sister, niece and daughter, as well a Catholic spiritual adviser, said DOC spokeswoman Jessica Cary.

‘Carrying out the sentence of the death penalty is one of our most solemn duties,’ Cary told reporters. ‘[We strive to] carry it out in a dignified and humane manner.’

Henry was put to death using a combination of three drugs, beginning with midazolam to render him unconscious.

After that, the condemned man was injected with vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride.

John Henry has become the third man to be put to death in the U.S. since April, when officials in Oklahoma botched the lethal injection of Clayton Lockett, who ended up dying from a heart attack.

The case made international headlines and led to the postponement of nine executions nationwide.

The
 63-year-old Floria man's execution Wednesday was preceded by those of 
Georgia inmate Marcus Wellons and Missouri convicted killer John 
Winfiled, who were put to death Tuesday night.

Neither execution had any noticeable complications, and Henry's execution Wednesday also appeared to go normally.

Georgia and Missouri both use the single drug pentobarbital, a sedative, whereas Florida uses a three-drug cocktail.

Midazolam,
 a sedative used before surgery, has only been used in Florida since 
October; previously, sodium thiopental was used, but its U.S. 
manufacturer stopped making it and Europe banned its manufacturers from 
exporting it for executions.

Henry's was be the 13th execution in Florida since April 2013, and the 18th since Republican Gov. Rick Scott took office in 2011.

Scott on Tuesday brushed aside questions about the state's execution procedures, saying he has to 'uphold the laws of the land.'

When asked directly if he had discussed with the Department of Corrections what happened in Oklahoma and whether any changes were needed in Florida, Scott would only say: 'I focus on making sure that we do things the right way here.'

During Henry's trial, prosecutors said the unemployed bricklayer went to Suzanne Henry's home three days before Christmas of 1985 to talk about buying a gift for the boy, who was Suzanne's son from a prior relationship. They fought over Henry living with another woman and he stabbed her 13 times in the neck and face.

Prosecutors said Henry then took the boy and drove around for nine hours, sometimes smoking crack cocaine, before stabbing him five times in the neck.

Hours later, Henry told a detective, he found himself wandering a field. He later told therapists he had killed the child to reunite him with his mother.

Henry tried to use an insanity defense for killing his wife.

Psychiatrists at the 
trial testified that Henry had a low IQ, suffered from chronic paranoia 
and smoked crack. He told them he had intended to commit suicide after 
killing the boy but said he was unable to go through with it.

In
 an appeal the Florida Supreme Court rejected last week, attorney Baya 
Harrison III wrote that Henry's 'abhorrent childhood, extensive personal
 and family mental health history, poor social adjustment, and lack of 
rational thinking and reasoning skills so impaired his adaptive 
functioning that he was actually performing at the level of a person 
with an IQ of 70.'

In May, a panel of mental health experts said 
Henry doesn't suffer from mental illness or an intellectual disability 
and that he understands "the nature and effect of the death penalty and 
why it is to be imposed on him," according to court records.
