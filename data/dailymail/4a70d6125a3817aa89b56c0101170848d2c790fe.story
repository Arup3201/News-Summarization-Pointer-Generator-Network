Scotland Yard detectives probing the disappearance of Madeleine McCann today grilled a convicted rapist over her disappearance for over six hours.

Operation Grange chief, DCI Andy Redwood, arrived in Portugal this morning for three days of questioning with 11 witnesses.

It is the third time the  pig farmer, Joaquim Jose Marques, has been quizzed about the youngster's disappearance from her  holiday apartment in May 2007. 

Marques - initially linked to Madeleine's disappearance after being identified by an artist's drawing of the potential suspect - assaulted two cameramen as he left Faro Police Station following his interrogation.

He fell to the ground as he tried to throw a punch at one, and threw a bottle of water at another when he returned from a quick lunch.

Investigation: Last month it emerged the British police investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann (pictured) has cost almost £8million

Marques threatened reporters with a gun outside his Algarve pig farm when he was first identified as a suspect in January 2008, but was understood to have been ruled out of the investigation after providing an alibi.

He was questioned 20 days after Madeleine vanished in May 2007, and again after the release of a sketch done by a forensic artist from the FBI, based on descriptions by British tourist Gail Cooper.

She told the police a 'creepy man' came to her villa in the Praia da Luz resort where Madeleine disappeared from to ask for donations for a nearby orphanage -- days before the youngster went missing.

Marques, who was living with his British hairdresser girlfriend and their three-year-old daughter at the time, was then identified as a convicted rapist by Portuguese press.

Diario de Noticias reported he was sentenced to five years in jail in 1996 for raping a British teenager in Praia da Luz in 1995, while an accomplice targeted her friend.

Police also questioned a former laundryman at the Ocean Club holiday resort where Madeleine was staying at when she vanished.

Mario Marreiros, 48, revealed last year how he told police about a man wearing sunglasses lurking in a stairwell near Madeleine McCann's apartment just 24 hours before she vanished.

The man who claimed he had never spoken to British police told a newspaper: 'My theory is that guy must have been involved, either in the kidnapping or studying what to do - their movements.

'He was there for something, for sure.' 

The potential suspect, later identified by the ex-Ocean Club worker, is also understood to have been ruled out of the Madeleine McCann inquiry after turning out to be a tourist.

Scotland Yard detectives arrived in Portugal this morning to oversee the fresh round of interviews over her disappearance. 

Seven of the men and women due to be questioned have been described as people of 'high interest' to the Madeleine McCann probe. 

Four others thought to be of lesser importance include a former British suspect, Robert Murat, and his wife.

Mr Murat's lawyer confirmed he has been asked to attend Faro Police station as a witness, along with Michaela Walczuch. The pair are due to arrive tomorrow morning at around 9.30am for questioning.

Francisco Pagarete said: 'Mr Murat will be questioned tomorrow. I will be attending the police station with him.

'He has been asked in for questioning as a witness. Michaela has also been asked in for questioning on the same day.' 

John Hill, manager of the Ocean Club holiday resort where Madeleine was staying when she vanished on May 3, 2007, is also expected to be interviewed.

British police have reportedly supplied over 250 questions for the Portuguese authorities to ask the 11 witnesses.  

DCI Nicola Wall from the Met's Homicide and Major Crime Command Unit, who is due to take over leadership of the investigation when Mr Redwood retires on December 22, is expected to arrive in Faro later this week.

British detectives are expected to ask for permission to carry out new tests on DNA material held at a lab in Coimbra, northern Portugal, once she's in charge of the Operation Grange case. 

The interviews arranged for this week follow a fifth international letter of request from the British authorities. They are the first since four men were quizzed as 'arguidos' or suspects at the start of July.

All four, who included Russian businessman Sergey Malinka and a schizophrenic heroin addict, insisted they had nothing to do with Madeleine McCann's disappearance. 

Individuals in Portugal are given 'arguido' status if authorities suspect their involvement in a crime but are not in a position to arrest or charge them. The 11 men and women due to be questioned this week could in theory be made arguidos at any time.

If that happens, they can only be quizzed in the presence of a lawyer and can refuse to answer questions.

IT consultant Mr Murat, who had his arguido status removed in 2008 when the first Portuguese probe into Madeleine's disappearance was shelved, has said his conscience is clear and he is happy to speak to police again if required.

Vanished: Madeleine McCann was three years old when she disappeared from her holiday resort in Praia da Luz (pictured) in May 2007

Brtitish police maintain the belief that Madeleine was killed during a bungled burglary -- a theory their Portuguese counterparts have privately rubbished.

Parts of the Praia da Luz resort where Madeleine vanished were dug up in June at Scotland Yard's request in a grim search for her body which failed to yield any clues. 

Last month it emerged the British police investigation into Madeleine's disappearance has cost almost £8million.

DCI Redwood and his colleagues, who normally fly with British Airways, jetted to Portugal yesterday morning with budget carrier, EasyJet.
