After almost three years on sale, and despite a price drop from £4million to £3.75million, Phil Neville’s ‘mansion in the sky’ failed to find a buyer.

Now the former football star is trying his luck in the rental market. Neville, 36, is looking for someone willing to pay £15,000 a month – £180,000 over a year – to live in the four-bedroom apartment until a purchaser turns up.

Despite its opulence, however, the decor may not be to everyone’s taste. The apartment, which occupies three linked storeys 500ft up in Manchester’s 47-storey Beetham Tower, was decorated by Kelly Hoppen, interior designer to the stars, in a black and white colour scheme.

Astonishing: Thought to be one of the city's most expensive rental properties ever, the 45th-floor apartment boasts four bedrooms and stunning near 360 degree views from its floor-to-ceiling windows

For the kids: While bedrooms occupy the top floor, most of the bottom floor is a custom-built playroom

Looking for interest: The estate agents said they have had 'quite a few enquiries about this property since we put it up for rent but have yet to find a tenant'

It also features a bathroom themed on Disney’s Little Mermaid, while children’s bedrooms come with fairytale castle wardrobes.

The 5,000sq ft apartment, named The Orchid Suite, has five parking spaces.

Former Manchester United and Everton 
player Neville, now retired, paid £3.1million for the property and moved
there in 2006 with his wife Julie and their two children. The family 
moved to a £4million Cheshire mansion in 2011.

expensive rental properties ever, the 45th-floor apartment boasts four 
bedrooms and stunning near 360 degree views from its floor-to-ceiling

‘This is in a prime location and on another level of luxury. We have had quite a few enquiries about this property since we put it up for rent but have yet to find a tenant.

‘Because of the transfer window, this is one of the busiest times of year for us in terms of new players, managers and football executives coming to Manchester.’

Neville spent almost £4million on a palatial new home in Cheshire’s sought-after village of Hale in the heart of Footballers’ Wives country, it was revealed in August 2011.

The six-bedroom detached new-build mansion was on the market with local agents Gascoigne Halman and includes a cinema, gym, sauna, steam room and large garage.
