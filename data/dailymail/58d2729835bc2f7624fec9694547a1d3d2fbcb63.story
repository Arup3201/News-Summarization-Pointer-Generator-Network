Cadbury is launching a chocolate bar aimed at women in an attempt to win back lost sales among the diet-conscious.

The Crispello is the first new chocolate bar launched by the company since the 1990s and will be backed by a £7million advertising campaign.

Industry research shows that annual sales of single chocolate bars have fallen by some 6.6 per cent in a market worth around £800million a year.

Revenge is sweet: Cadbury hope the Crispello chocolate bar will reverse falling sales, especially among women

Evidence suggests that this slump is almost entirely caused by women buying  less chocolate.

Cadbury, owned by American food company Kraft, believes the Crispello will particularly appeal to women who are worried about putting on weight.

The new bar comes in at 165 calories, compared with 260 for a Mars bar. The Crispello, which is similar in taste and consistency to Ferrero Rocher chocolates, has three chocolate-covered wafer shells with a soft milk chocolate filling.

It is designed with a resealable pack so it can be eaten one piece at a time.

The Crispello will be sold under the slogan ‘A little treat for you’, on the basis that women can enjoy it without feeling guilty.

The strategy of designing a chocolate bar specifically for one gender over another seems something of a throwback to the 1980s.

Guilt free: Cadbury hopes that women will be allured by the fact that the new chocolate bar has almost 100 less calories than a 260 calorie Mars bar

The popular Yorkie bars were advertised then under the enduring slogan ‘It’s not for girls’ and featured manly truck drivers biting into the thick chunks.

Brand manager at Kraft Foods, Toby Smart, said: ‘Crispello is a lighter way to enjoy the nation’s favourite chocolate taste.’

Earlier this year, Kraft rival Mars launched Galaxy Flutes in the UK, which is being sold as a lighter on-the-go chocolate snack.

A Cadbury spokesman said: ‘The mix of wafer and chocolate is a lighter way to eat chocolate and we know from experience that women are attracted to this particular format.

‘It will also appeal to women because it is in three separate portions so they can consume a little at a time rather than in one go.’

The 30g bar will go on sale on October 8 with a recommended price of 50p.
