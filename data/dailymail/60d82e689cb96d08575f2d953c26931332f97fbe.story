The death toll of the Nigeria's Islamist insurgency has risen to more than 200 in a single week after 48 people were killed in Boko Haram raids in the country's north-east.

Militants stormed three villages near the town of Chibok, Borno State, where Boko Haram snatched nearly 300 girls from their boarding school dorm last month.

Hours after a double car bombing killed at least 130 in a central Nigerian city, villagers were forced to bolt into the bush as their homes and possessions were burned and looted.

The bombs struck a crowded bus terminal and market, with the second going off half an hour after the first

The attacks came as 80 U.S. Air Force personnel arrived in Chad, which shares a part of its border with Borno state, on a mission to help track down the girls being held captive by Boko Haram.

They are helping with intelligence by operating a Predator drone in missions over and around northern Nigeria, the U.S. said.

About 40 of the personnel make up the launch and recovering teams for the drone and the other 40 are troops acting as the security force for the team, said Lieutenant Colonel Myles Caggins.

Predators are the main type of unmanned aircraft used for drone strikes in Afghanistan and the Pakistani tribal areas, where they are armed with 100lb Hellfire missiles.

Although the the U.S. has said that it is being used for reconnaissance, the deployment of such a fearsome weapon seems to mark an escalation in the campaign against Boko Haram.

The deployment will be in addition to unarmed Global Hawks already being used in the search, said a senior U.S. official who preferred to remain anonymous.

During the latest attack on three northeastern villages, which came overnight on Tuesday and early Wednesday, residents who fled to the bush watched while Boko Haram fighters set their thatched-roof mud homes ablaze.

'We saw our village go up in flames as we hid in the bush waiting for the dawn. We lost everything,' Apagu Maidaga of the village of Alagarno told The Associated Press by telephone.

The nearby villages of Bulakurbe and Shawa also were attacked.

Schools in Nigeria are shut today as teachers hold a day of protests calling for the release of the 276 schoolgirls still being held captive by Boko Haram.

Michael Olukoya, president of the Nigerian Union of Teachers, told Nigeria's Premium Times that his members would not stop campaigning 'until our girls are brought back safe and alive and the perpetrators of the heinous crimes are brought to book.'

Another union leader, Segun Raheem, said that teachers were also a target of Boko Haram - whose name roughly translates to 'Western education is sinful' - and that authorities must do more to protect them.

'The majority of them are scared. They don't even sleep at home. And when they go to school, it is with shock,' he told BBC News. 

'We feel that enough security has not been put in place... and we call on the government... not to play politics with the lives of our children and the teachers.'

In Jos, central Nigeria, the site of two powerful car bombings in a crowded bus terminal and market on Tuesday, rescue workers with body bags combed the rubble for more bodies. Scores of people gathered at mortuaries and hospitals to search for missing loved ones.

Officials reported an additional 12 deaths from the blasts: seven mutilated bodies were recovered from the scene and five of the wounded died in the hospital.

Most victims were women and children who worked in the market as vendors, said Mohammed Abdulsalam of the National Emergency Management Agency. 'We expect to find more bodies in the rubble,' he said.

Jos was tense with fears that the attack could inflame religious rivalry in the city, which sits on a volatile fault line dividing Nigeria's Muslim north from its Christian south.

'Allahu akhbar!' some young men yelled provocatively at an AP photographer near the scene, using the war cry of Islamic militants within earshot of soldiers at a checkpoint.

Positive thinking: Brigadier General Olajide Laleye yesterday insisted that victory was close and dismissed reports of low morale among his men

Officials have suggested the extremists are feeding into tribal and religious tensions to spread the insurgency outside of their stronghold in Nigeria's north-east, which was part of an Islamic kingdom before colonisation.

Security forces cordoned off the mounds of rubble, burned-out vehicles and obliterated buildings with the debris of panic scattered around — a sandal here, a hat there. Exploded mangoes and pineapples rotted in the sun, their sickly sweet smell mixing with the stench of rotting human flesh.

Despite the spiralling bloodshed, Nigerian army spokesman Brigadier General Olajide Laleye yesterday insisted that victory was close. He dismissed reports of troops suffering from low morale and lack of basic equipment, including bullet-proof vests.

'I make bold to say that the Nigerian Army is steadily and surely reversing the ugly menace of terrorism and insurgency in the northeast part of this great nation,' he said at an army recruiting campaign.

But extremist attacks have increased in frequency and deadliness, with more than 2,000 people killed so far this year, compared to an estimated 3,600 between 2010 and 2013.

On Monday, a car bomb at a bus station killed 24 people in the Christian quarter of the northern Muslim city of Kano, where police later defused another massive car bomb.

Two separate bomb blasts in April around another bus station, in the nation's capital of Abuja, killed more than 120 people and wounded more than 200.
