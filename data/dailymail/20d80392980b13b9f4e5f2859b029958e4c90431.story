Around one tenth of accidents that happen at crossroads are due to someone driving straight through a red light.

But - rather distressingly for responsible drivers - half the people killed aren't the drivers who drove past the red signal.

Now MIT researchers have developed an algorithm that can 'detect' drivers who're likely to drive straight across a red light - before they do so.

The warning system will give drivers a two-second warning that an oncoming car is about to shoot a red light - it uses advanced 'V2V' vehicle-to-vehicle communications systems already in development by Ford

The monitor 'watches' deceleration and distance from a light - and 'guesses' which cars are likely to break the Highway Code. 

Crucially, the software can provide two seconds' warning if someone else is about to shoot across a crossroads - enough time for other drivers to hit the brakes.

'The challenge is, you don't want to 
be overly pessimistic,' How says. 'If you're too pessimistic, you start 
reporting there's a problem when there really isn't, and then very 
rapidly, the human's going to push a button that turns this thing off.'

Jonathan How, the Richard Cockburn Maclaurin Professor of Aeronautics 
and Astronautics at MIT, says 'smart' cars of the future may use the system to help drivers anticipate and avoid potential accidents.

The researchers tested the algorithm on data collected from an intersection in Virginia, finding that it accurately identified potential violators within a couple of seconds of reaching a red light — enough time, according to the researchers, for other drivers at an intersection to be able to react to the threat if alerted.

The creators think the system will allow 'smart cars' to warn drivers of other dangerous drivers - before the cars even get close enough to cause a crash

Compared to other efforts to model driving behavior, the MIT algorithm generated fewer false alarms, an important advantage for systems providing guidance to human drivers.

The researchers report their findings in a paper that will appear in the journal IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems.'If you had some type of heads-up display for the driver, it might be able to warn you of other drivers who are a 'concern' says How, who is one of the paper's authors.

"Even though your light might be green, it may recommend you not go, because there are people behaving badly that you may not be aware of."How says that in order to implement such warning systems, vehicles would need to be able to 'talk' with each other, wirelessly sending and receiving information such as a car's speed and position data.

Such vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, he says, can potentially improve safety and avoid traffic congestion.

Today, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is exploring V2V technology, along with several major car manufacturers — including Ford Motor Company, which this year has been road-testing prototypes with advanced Wi-Fi and collision-avoidance systems.The researchers are now investigating ways to design a closed-loop system — to give drivers a recommendation of what to do in response to a potential accident — and are also planning to adapt the existing algorithm to air traffic control, to predict the behavior of aircraft.
