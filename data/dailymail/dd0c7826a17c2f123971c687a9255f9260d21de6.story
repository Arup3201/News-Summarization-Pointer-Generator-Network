A government minister grew so fed up with Whitehall’s ‘clunky and rubbish’ IT systems he had his own personal wi-fi network installed.

Francis Maude became frustrated at the time it took to log on to government systems and wanted to use his iPad instead.

But the Cabinet Office minister was astonished to find that a multi-million contract signed by the Labour government did not include providing a easy wireless web access usually found in coffee shops.

Frustration: Cabinet Office Francis Maude, pictured in his Whitehall office, demanded wi-fi be installed so he could use his iPad and bypass cumbersome government systems

He now wants almost all civil servants to use ‘off the shelf’ computers and mobile phones to cut costs and speed up the way they work.

The coalition has grown increasingly irritated with the way Whitehall buys and uses technology.

A study found civil servants waste the equivalent of three days a year waiting for their computers to turn on.

Mr Maude was forced to take matters into his own hands when he could not get his phone or iPad to work in his Whitehall office.

He refused to use a high security 
computer issued by contractors under the Labour deal because it involved
entering numerous passwords and could not use it to surf the internet 
properly.

Farce: IT systems in different departments are not compatible so officials have to dash around Whitehall carrying printouts of emails

Instead he had a wi-fi system 
installed in his office overlooking Horse Guards Parade so he can 
by-pass government systems and use his iPad to go online.

A source close to Mr Maude said: ‘He got wi-fi so he can use the internet on his own machine.

‘When we came into government everybody in the Cabinet Office was using encrypted laptops which cost £7,000-a-year to run.

‘You can buy several good machines off the shelf for that. This was under a contract signed by the last government.

‘What were Labour doing signing up to an IT contract which didn’t include wi-fi?’

Sensitive: A document detailing on what days different milk was bought for civil servants to make tea and coffee was marked 'restricted' by over-zealous security officials

It is understood the contract is due to expire soon and Mr Maude is demanding it be dramatically rewritten.

In
June Stephen Kelly, the Government's new chief operating officer, 
revealed his frustrations with Whitehall’s IT: 'I came into the office 
and I pressed my PC and it took me seven minutes to boot up.

'That's government in the old world, that's three days of the year I waste of my time booting up,' the Standard reported.

'I think the average cost of a desktop [computer] a year is about £6,000. You could go and buy 10 iPads a year.'

The changes emerged as Mr Maude announced changes to the security classification of documents in a bid to improve communication and save millions of pounds.

In future all documents will be either top secret, secret or official after ministers condemned the old six-tier system as a Cold War relic.

Mr Maude ordered the shake-up after learning that a document detailing on what days full fat, semi-skimmed and skimmed milk was bought for civil servants to make tea and coffee was marked 'restricted' by over-zealous security officials.

An official was also landed in hot water for leaving a document marked ‘restricted’ on a printer, even though it was the only thing written on the sheet of paper.

Mr Maude said: ‘Whitehall uses a security classification system designed decades ago.

‘We
are changing that and introducing a new system fit for the digital age.
It will speed up decisions, make it easier to share information and 
save hard-working taxpayers' money.

‘There has been a tendency to over mark documents rather than to manage risk properly.

‘This can devalue the basic security principles.

‘We think the most important and sensitive materials should be protected
as 'Top Secret' or 'Secret' but for other information the new 
'Official' category, with its renewed emphasis upon personal 
responsibility and accountability, will be appropriate for most of what 
government does.’
