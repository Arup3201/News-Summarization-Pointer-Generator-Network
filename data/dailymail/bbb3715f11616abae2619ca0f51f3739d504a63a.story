A technology firm from Massachusetts has discovered Virginia has the speediest average web connection across the US.

And for those who don't want to wait a long 
time for their internet to load they should avoid moving to Alaska known
 for its slow internet speed of only 7Mbps.

Business Insider reports that Akamai Technologies published a 'state of the internet' report mapped by Broadview Networks to show the speed by state.

Virginia came in first place with a download speed of 13.7 Megabytes per second (Mbps).

In second place, Delaware and Massachusetts tied by having an average download speed of 13.7 Mbps.

Washington, D.C., Washington, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire came in third place with 12-13 ballparks.

Michigan, Utah, and Connecticut were among the high ranks and are some of the top ten states with the fastest internet connection.

Arkansas, Kentucky, Montana, West Virginia, and Mississippi offer extremely slow internet, but not nearly as slow as Alaska.
