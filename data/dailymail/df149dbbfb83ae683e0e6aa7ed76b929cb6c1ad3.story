A grandmother and two parents face felony child abuse charges after police found two toddlers locked in metal dog kennels at a Gulfport, Mississippi home.

Narcotics division officers discovered the children, aged one and two, while serving a search warrant on their father in an unrelated narcotics case at the house last month.

The toddlers were locked in the cages at the home, according to police.

While serving a search warrant for the father, Patrick Braddock, 35, on January 28, police arrested him at the time on charges related to the narcotics investigation. 

The mother, Brittany Kay Braddock, 26, and the grandmother, Pamela Diane Davis, 60, were present during the initial search warrant, but were not arrested until Tuesday for child abuse charges.

Narcotics division officers discovered the children while serving a search warrant in an unrelated narcotics case at the house (the home on where the toddlers were found)

Each of the suspects were charged with two counts of felony child abuse, and the Department of Human Services took custody of the toddlers. 

Brittany said the accusations by authorities are 'exaggerated', according to the Sun Herald.

She said: 'I'm really stressed out right now. I just got out of jail. It got totally messed up by the police. The police made it look like I put them in there all the time and I trap them in there.' 

Adam Cooper from the Gulfport Police Department said their discovery is 'infuriating' and 'egregious, according to WKRG. 

He also said first and foremost the concern was for the children, and they they worked with the DHS to get the children taken out of the situation.

Patrick remains in custody at the Harrison County Jail on a $100,000 bond.

Pamela was released on Tuesday after posting a $20,000 bond and Brittany posted a bond of the same amount, and was released on Wednesday, according to WNEM.

The state Department of Human Services is also investigating the incident.

No further details on the cages or whether the children showed other signs of abuse or neglect were released (a tag found one of the kennels which said 'your dog's home for life')
