Accused: Daniel Green is suspected of killing his mother, sister, niece and seven-month-old nephew

A forty-year-old man obsessed with Selena Gomez has been accused of murdering his mother and sister, along with her teenage daughter and baby, at the Oklahoma City home they all shared on Wednesday night.

Daniel Green was arrested near a 7-11 store a couple of hours after a family friend raised the alarm at around 11pm after finding bloody footprints on the doormat, and the bodies.

Green faces charges of killing his 57-year-old mother, Sallie, his sister Rebecca Cizek, 34, and her two children Katherine, 16, and seven-month-old Amario Dominguez III.

The state medical examiner said Mrs Green and the baby died of gunshot wounds to the head. It has not yet been said how Ms Cizek and her teenage daughter died, according to The Oklahoman.

Helicopters were used to search for Green and police circulated his description to nearby stores after neighbors told them the 40-year-old was often seen pacing the sidewalk and buying energy drinks.

He was arrested close to a 7-11, after the clerk recognized him and contacted police, according to Fox25.

A police spokesman confirmed Green's relationship to his alleged suspects and said that a family friend, who lived at the address, had returned home to discover the bodies.

The motive for the killing is not known, but if Green is found guilty his obsession with young star Selena Gomez may be a factor, a psychologist told News 9.

The 40-year-old's Facebook page was filled with pictures and posts about the star, including many that suggested he was fantasizing that he was in a relationship with her.

'This person is obviously significantly troubled, then that frustration and those problems may build up to the point that he felt like he had no other options,' Dr Steven Sternlof said.

He added that although he had not met Green or treated him, he could recognize the warning signs, News 9 reported.

'Someone that may have an obsession, in this case with a celebrity, might have a compulsion to respond in a certain way, thinking that this celebrity is in love with them or they're in love with the celebrity and they need to be close together, and they may need to stop others that are interfering in that relationship,' Dr Sternlof said.

In his Facebook posts, Green makes constant reference to Gomez and posted a threat against her celebrity boyfriend in October 2011, saying: 'Justin Bieber is going to get a bullet in his head'.

Neighbors claimed Green often spoke to them about his past lives or was seen talking to himself, according to NewsChannel 4.
