Chelsea have promised to ban the thugs who sang racist songs and assaulted a black man on the Paris Metro.

Footage showing Chelsea fans twice shoving the commuter off a train emerged during Tuesday’s 1-1 Champions League draw against Paris Saint-Germain. 

They then sang, ‘We’re racist, we’re racist, we’re racist, and that’s the way we like it’ as other passengers got off to avoid a confrontation.

A Chelsea fan claims supporters prevented the black man getting on the train because it was too full and that the racist chant was actually about club captain John Terry.

Police on both sides of the Channel said they would prosecute any fans who are identified in shocking scenes that were filmed at Richelieu-Drouot Metro station by ex-pat Paul Nolan and published online during the clash at the Parc des Princes.

Nolan said: ‘He was completely shocked when they pushed him off. I don’t think he realised who they were. He then tried to get on again and got pushed off a second time.’

Chelsea moved quickly to condemn the yobs and promised to ban any fan found to have been involved.

‘Such behaviour is abhorrent and has no place in football or society,’ said a club spokesman. 

‘We will support any criminal action and should evidence point to the involvement of Chelsea season-ticket holders or members, the club will take the strongest possible action, including banning orders.’

Former Chelsea defender Graeme Le Saux appealed for fans who witnessed the incident or recognise any of the faces to come forward.

Le Saux wrote on Twitter: ‘Please help @ChelseaFC find those involved in disgraceful scenes in Paris. We need to show football is united against discrimination.’

Prime Minister David Cameron also demanded swift action, calling the incident ‘extremely disturbing and very worrying’.

Police forces in Paris and London are working together to identify the group of fans who were travelling to the stadium before kick-off. They plan to track down Mitchell McCoy, 17, who claimed to have been in the carriage when the black commuter was prevented from boarding.

McCoy claimed: ‘He tried to get on and a few people were pushing him off because there wasn’t much space. He tried to force himself on. He was really aggressive.  

'I’d say it was self-defence, pushing him off. People were saying it was because he was black. It’s not true.’

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘We will examine the footage with a view to seeing if we can apply for football banning orders, preventing people from travelling to future matches.’

In Paris the public prosecutor’s office has opened an investigation.

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, who is said to be appalled by the disturbing images of the club’s own supporters, is expected to address the issue at a press conference on Friday.

The Professional Footballers' Association condemned the 'group of so-called Chelsea fans' and PFA deputy chief executive, Bobby Barnes, said: 'I am extremely saddened that such a great football club has had its name dragged into the gutter by a very ignorant minority who seemingly equate supporting Chelsea and cheering for the likes of Didier Drogba, Ramires and John Obi Mikel, with abusing a fellow passenger on a train who was going about his own business.

'I am sure that Chelsea will seek to take strong action against the supporters shown in the video as the club works very hard through their community and education programmes.' 

Kick It Out chairman Lord Ouseley echoed their stance, and said: 'I was shocked that Chelsea fans were still behaving like this. 

'I thought the club had made it quite clear and taken action about stopping any repetition, knowing Chelsea, how hard they've worked on these matters, with fans as well as players, that it was unlikely to occur.

'The fact it involved an assault as well, of the individual that they pushed off the train, was even more shocking. Clearly it sends out a strong signal to, not only Chelsea, but the whole of football, that you cannot be complacent and think the actions you're taking are sufficient to deal with the scourge of racism, sexism, homophobia and anti-Semitism. We've got to do a lot more and not be complacent.'
