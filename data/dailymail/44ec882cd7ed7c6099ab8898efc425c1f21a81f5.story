The world's biggest tobacco firms are pouring millions into electronic cigarette advertising, bringing back the cigarette commercials that were banned in the 1990s.

Tobacco companies have already spent £11.5million advertising 'smoking deterrent products' in the UK this year - including e-cigarettes and nicotine patches - beating last year's £13.6million record.

And the total figure since 2009 amounts to a staggering £60million, according to market research company Nielsen.

Sales of electronic cigarettes have risen tenfold in the last year, labelled as a 'healthy' alternative to smoking and promoted by celebrities who have taken them up.

Existing advertising rules ban tobacco products from being promoted, but there are no rules against depicting cigarettes.

British American Tobacco, the maker of Lucky Strike and Benson & Hedges, was the first tobacco company to launch an e-cigarette in Britain in July, and Philip Morris International, the world’s biggest tobacco company, is due to launch e-cigarette soon.

Imperial Tobacco, the maker of Davidoff, has an electronic cigarette coming out next year.

Around 1.3million Britons have taken up 'vaping' - inhaling nicotine vapours given out by the battery-powered plastic devices, which contain liquid nicotine.

That figure is up from 700,000 last year - and sales of the fake fags are predicted to rise to £193million by the end of the year and £339million annually, Nielsen said.

The devices not due to be regulated 
as medicines until 2016, and health experts are concerned that they could glamourise smoking again after decades of fighting to cut smoking rates.

Prices typically range from £7 to £60 and the devices come in flavours such as blueberry and chocolate.

Analysts at Canaccord Genuity, the investment bank, expect them to be the 'most significant development in the history of the organised tobacco industry'.

The existing tobacco business is worth £450 billion, and big tobacco companies companies in the United States have made television advertisements using Jenny McCarthy, a former Playboy model, and actor Stephen Dorff.

And e-cigarette campaigns have already come to UK TV screens, with actor and Strictly Come Dancing contestant Mark Benton fronting a £600,000 ad for the E-Lites brand.

Gamucci brand plans to raise £200 million from investors partly to fund an advertising blitz in 2014.

BAT uses social media, such as Twitter and Facebook, and attractive young people tour cities promoting its smoking devices from cars with Vype branding.

Philippe Zell, director of sales and marketing at Nicoventures - owned by BAT, which is using Facebook and Twitter to promote its devices - said that the company 'will be ramping up our presence'.

Advertising spending on e-cigarettes and 
other smoking materials and accessories went from £1.7 million in 2010 
to £13.1 million last year, according to Kantar Media.

Shane MacGuill, a tobacco industry analyst at Euromonitor, says BAT is likely to advertise on television using 'modest, vague and after the watershed' tactics.

Tobacco advertising was banned in cinemas in 1986, while cigars and loose tobacco were banned from television commercials in the early 1990s.

Cool? Analysts say that if cigarettes appear on TV again, it could undo years of anti-smoking campaigning

And while there is no concrete proof that the e-cigarettes are damaging to health, New York's mayor Michael Bloomberg has said he wants to rid his city of both real cigarettes and the electronic alternative.

Recently leaked drafts of three tobacco-related bills that are expected to be introduced into the City Council indicate that Bloomberg's planning to regulate e-cigs into extinction.

Sales of e-cigarettes are already banned in Norway, Singapore and Brazil, among others, and France is set to impose the same restrictions on ecigs as on regular smokes.
