A market town in Nottinghamshire was today named as the best place in England and Wales to bring up a family.

Bingham, which has a population of 9,000, has topped a study which examined factors including quality of schools, childcare provision, affordability of living and crime levels.

Areas in the Midlands and the North of England are now more prominent thanks to more affordable housing in relation to the South, according to Family Investments which commissioned the survey.

Top town for families: Bingham, which lies nine miles east of Nottingham, has a population of 9,000 people

Preferred location: St Mary and All Saints Church in Bingham, a town which is home to a large variety of clubs and social groups including a model railway club, folk club and archery club

The areas making up the remainder of the top ten are Crowthorne, Berkshire; Winscombe, Somerset; Colyton, Devon; Oakham, Rutland; Wokingham, Berkshire; Poynton, Cheshire; Swanland, Yorkshire; Faringdon, Oxfordshire and Dunnington, Yorkshire.

These are followed by Longridge, Lancashire; Church Crookham, Hampshire; Yarm, Yorkshire; Woodley, Berkshire; Shebbear, Devon; Leyland, Lancashire; Sedbergh, Cumbria; Kirkham, Lancashire; Kesgrave, Suffolk and Buckingham in Buckinghamshire.

The study noted that 77 per cent of GCSE pupils in Bingham achieved A* to C grades compared with the national average of 43 per cent, while the area had a large variety of clubs and social groups and affordable house prices.

Kate Moore, head of savings and investments at Family Investments, said: ‘Bingham's combination of affordable housing, low crime and excellent local schools make it a winning location for bringing up a family.

First place: Bingham's affordable house prices make it an attractive destination with an average two bed property costing £138,969 versus the national average of £173,632

Amenities: In addition to a farmers' market, the centre of the Nottinghamshire town has a range of retail outlets, including a post office, pharmacy and six local pubs

‘It's set in a relatively rural location but is a large enough town to have good amenities and the locals tell us there's a strong community spirit.

Bingham, which lies nine miles east of Nottingham, has a
population of 9,000 people.

Close to Newark-on-Trent and Grantham, it scored highly
in Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 4 results - with four schools, including
three primaries and a secondary comprehensive.

The town is home to a large variety of clubs and social
groups including a model railway club, folk club and archery club.

In addition to a farmers’ market, the centre has a range of
retail outlets, including a post office, pharmacy and six local pubs.

Equipped with sports amenities and a swimming pool, Bingham
Leisure Centre is popular with residents, as is the local Scout Group which
attracts 140 youngsters.

Bingham’s affordable house prices make it an attractive
destination with an average two-bedroom property costing £138,969 versus the
national average of £173,632.

A train to London can take as little as two hours with a change, while driving the 127-mile route takes around two-and-a-half hours.

‘Every parent will have a different idea about what makes the ideal location to bring up their family but we have tried to be as comprehensive as possible in measuring a huge range of factors to come up with a list which reflects the attributes parents tell us are most important.

‘One of the most noticeable trends in this year's report was the increased number of locations in the Midlands and northern England compared to last year.

‘This largely reflects the shift in house price trends over the past year resulting in increased affordability of property outside of the South of England. Lancashire for example scored well in this year's report with three of the top 20 postcodes located in the county.’

The factors considered by the study included key stage two and four results, school inspection outcomes, quantity and quality of early years care, affordability of childcare, local crime figures and property affordability.

It also considered the availability of an existing population of parents with young children, parks and green spaces, leisure centres, zoos and farms and museums and theatres.

No London location made it into the national top 20, mainly due to the high cost of property there - but the study also looked at the best spots in the capital for family friendly living.

Coming out on top was Bexley in south-east London, followed by Epsom and Banstead in south-west London. Sutton in south London and Rickmansworth in north-west London also scored well.

A spokesman for the company said it had not produced a list of Britain's worst towns for familes.

In context: Bingham is located east of Nottingham, south-west of Newark-on-Trent and south-east of Mansfield
