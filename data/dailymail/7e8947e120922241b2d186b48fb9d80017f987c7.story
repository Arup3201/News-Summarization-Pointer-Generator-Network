Great Britain have lost the world's best Taekwondo fighter after Aaron Cook announced his intention to switch allegiance to the Isle of Man.

The 21-year-old from Dorchester, Dorset, hit the headlines in the summer when he was beaten to a place in the British Olympic Taekwondo squad by Lutalo Muhammad.

Muhammad, who was ranked world number 59 at the time of selection, went on to win bronze in the under-80kg category.

Omitted: Aaron Cook (blue), the world's number one ranked Taekwondo fighter, has stated he will not compete again for Great Britain, instead donning the colours of the Isle of Man

Glory: Lutalo Muhammad, the world 59 selected ahead of Aaron Cook, went on to win a bronze medal at London 2012

Manx athletes compete under the British 
flag at Olympic games, and Cook is hoping the World Taekwondo Federation
(WTF) will introduce a route based on rankings rather than 
discretionary selection.

London 2012 was a success for British Taekwondo, with Jade Jones' gold in the women's 57kg category adding to Muhammad's bronze.

Anguish: Cook believes the World Taekwondo Federation will open up a path where selection is based on rankings rather than on discretion

Cook had won European Championships gold in May - Muhammad also won gold in the under-87kg event - and battled for a spot in the squad, but
British Taekwondo's decision was eventually ratified by the British 
Olympic Association (BOA) and he missed out.

Cook told Sky Sports News: 'I was reigning European champion, world number one - I am never going to work with those people [British Taekwondo] again.

'They have made their minds up with what they have done to me and I've made my mind up.'

'I think I am quite lucky at the moment,' added Cook

'The WTF are looking to organise new competitions, such as a grand prix, which they have said will open up a different path to the Olympics based on world rankings.

'So all I have got to do is go and win the World Championships, the European Championships and make sure I am top ranked in the world and I can get there off my own back which we didn't have in the past.'

Of his disappointment on having to 
look on rather than participate in the summer, Cook added: 'I am 
extremely jealous obviously, I wish that was me.

'She [Jade Jones] did fantastic and so did Lutalo and so did Martin Stamper.

'I just wish I could have been on that team, I felt I deserved to be on that team.

'I've got to find some peace and I've to go move forward and this Isle of Man [opportunity] has come up and I can't wait to be hopefully world champion next year.'

Jealous: Cook said he was 'extremely jealous' of missing out on the Olympic squad. 'I just wish I could have been on that team, I felt I deserved to be on that team'
