A mother and her three-year-old daughter were found dead on Wednesday in apparent murder-suicide at their home.

Jamie Nicole Helms, 39, and her daughter Blair were found in a car with the engine running around 4.30pm by the children's father who smashed his way inside in Jenks, Oklahoma.

Father Steve Helms, a firefighter, tried to revive his daughter. He also found his five-year-old son Cason in the garage and rushed him to hospital where his condition is unknown.

The father had gone to the home when he went to pick up his children from school and realized that they were not there.

Jenks police chief Cameron Arthur told Tulsaworld: 'He tried to revive (his daughter) but was unfortunately unsuccessful.'

Police
 found handwritten notes at the scene and were believed to have been 
written by Helms. Their contents were not disclosed but Chief Arthur 
said they were from somebody 'that really felt helpless'.

Ms Helms moved into the neighborhood of Sapulpa in November, according to witnesses at the scene.

Cause
 of death for the mother and daughter have not yet been confirmed by the
 medical examiner but indications are for carbon monoxide poisoning.

The police chief said that the father and son were being interviewed at  Saint Francis Hospital in Tulsa.

Jamie Nicole Helms filed for a divorce from Steven Helms on December 4 last year and the couple were due in court next week on March 11.

Mrs
 Helms was charged with domestic assault in November after she allegedly
 attacked and scratched her husband as he drove away from their home. 
The incident was caught on surveillance tape and happened in front of 
their children.

She pleaded not guilty to the charge and was due to face trial in June.
