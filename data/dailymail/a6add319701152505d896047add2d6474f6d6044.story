It seems The Duchess of York may be looking for some romantic inspiration in the run-up to Valentine's Day.

Sarah  attended the Contemporary British Love Poetry book launch at the iconic Fortnum & Mason store in London on Tuesday night, where she mingled with the volume's editor Greta Bellamacina and studied the poems closely.

The 55-year-old drew attention to her slim-line figure in a black trench coat drawn tightly in at the waist, which she accessorised with simple earrings.

Keeping the look chic and simple, she paired the coat, which sported large gold buttons, with black ballet pumps and wore her hair loose round her shoulders.

The former royal, chatted animatedly with Greta Bellamacina, who looked glamorous in a floor length Thirties-style gown with a plunging neckline.

The blonde beauty, who recently graduated from King's College London, has already made waves in literary circles.

Having studied English Language and communication, Greta, who is blessed with model-like looks, has already published her first book and worked for Dolce & Gabbana, All Saints and Sienna Miller's line Twenty8Twelve as an in-house poet.

Clearly a fan of Greta's work, the Duchess was seen asking her to autograph the book of poetry for her. 

She also chatted with artist and 'it girl' Isabella Cotier at the event, which launched the book Contemporary British Love Poetry.

The volume features the work of modern poets such as Clare Pollard, Annie Freud and John Cooper Clarke and gives a glamorous and romantic new image to British poetry.

At one point Sarah seemed to be reading aloud from the volume to Isabella Cotier, who illustrated the book.

The Fortnum & Mason website described the collection: 'From dark love to first love, love lost to love regained, the collection is a comprehensive study of the many facets of love, and the feelings we associate with it.' 

Perhaps the subject has been on her mind recently as the Duchess appeared on US television last month to defend her ex-husband Prince Andrew, with whom she enjoys a famously good relationship.

While appearing on the NBC morning Today show, to promote a soup-making kit to help weight-loss, Sarah stood up for Prince Andrew against allegations that he had sexual relations with an underage girl, allegations which Prince Andrew and Buckingham Palace have strongly denied.

The Duchess described him as a 'humongously good man' and 'my best friend and my best ex-husband ever'. 

Sarah Ferguson passionately defended her ex-husband, Prince Andrew, when she appeared on the Today show in America 

'I won't stand by - because I know what it feels like to have salacious lies made up about you - and not support him so publicly,' she told Matt Lauer.  

'I won't stand by and have his character defamed,' she said. 'I will not have one word said about him on any level. Any level.'

The pair, divorced in 1996 after ten years of marriage, and have two daughters together the princesses Beatrice, 26, and Eugenie, 24.
