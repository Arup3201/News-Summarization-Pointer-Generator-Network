Mats Hummels appeared to be flying high on the last day of his holiday, as he harbours hope of Borussia Dortmund's season taking off in similar vein.

The 26-year-old posted a picture of himself doing an aeroplane gesture on Instagram looking in good spirits on Monday.

He posted the message: 'One last impression from the vacation. Tomorrow back on the pitch, can't wait to play again.'

On the field things have been a real struggle for Dortmund this season, as they currently sit joint bottom of the Bundesliga with SC Freiburg, after picking up just 15 points from 17 games.

But Hummels - one of Dortmund's most prized assets - clearly remains positive about his side turning the corner despite a nightmare opening half to the season.

Next up for Jurgen Klopp's side is a trip to Bayer Leverkusen on January 31, following the end of the four-week winter break.
