A Western intelligence agent 'abducted by Russia' from NATO country Estonia faces up to 20 years in jail, it was revealed last night.

Tallinn has accused Moscow of an audacious stunt in kidnapping Eston Kohver from inside the European Union in a potential new East-West flashpoint.

The abduction involved a smoke grenade and jamming of Estonian radio communications as he was seized.

Raid: Russian security services released pictures of Eston Kohver, who they claim is intelligence-gathering for Estonia. He could be imprisoned for twenty years if found guilty of espionage

Spycraft: A specially convened closed-door court in Moscow was told at the weekend that Kohver was found in possession of a pistol, ammunition, 5,000 euros (£3,970), 'special equipment to carry out covert recording'

But the FSB security service - once headed by Vladimir Putin - accuses the 44-year-old agent of being inside Russia when he was held, and is now probing him over intelligence gathering on behalf of the ex-Soviet Baltic state.

Kohver is currently held in a high security Moscow prison, after being moved to the Russian capital from its border region of Pskov in an incident that revives memories of the Cold War.

He could face between ten and 20 years in jail if convicted of espionage, said a Russian source.

A specially convened closed-door court in Moscow was told at the weekend that Kohver was found in possession of a pistol, ammunition, 5,000 euros (£3,970), 'special equipment to carry out covert recording' and 'materials that seem to be assignments for an intelligence-gathering mission'.

Under the direction of a judge, he was ordered to be detained initially for two months while 'the necessary investigative work is carried out'

He was held in a cage under armed guard in the Lefortovo courtroom, close to one of Russia's most notorious jails.

Moscow played up the incident by allowing TV channels to show FSB footage of the grim-faced detainee and the items seized from him.

Under the direction of a judge, he was ordered to be detained initially for two months while 'the necessary investigative work is carried out'.

Tallinn - which has for years had tense relations with Moscow - claimed the KAPO intelligence agent was abducted by 'unidentified individuals from Russia'

The West is deeply suspicious over the incident, and its timing, which came two days after Barack Obama visited Tallinn and vowed that an attack on Estonia would be regarded as being against all of NATO.

Obama also hinted at a U.S. naval base being established in the country.

The EU is today to formalise a new set of sanctions against Russia over its 'aggressive' policies in Ukraine.

'Eston Kohver has been arrested. The sitting was held behind closed doors,' court spokeswoman Yulia Skotnikova told Interfax, declining to further elaborate.

'Eston Kohver, an officer from the Tartu office of the Security Police Department of Estonian Interior Ministry, has been held in the Russian Federation,' said an FSB spokesman.

Tallinn - which has for years had tense relations with Moscow - claimed the KAPO (Estonian Internal Security Service) intelligence agent was abducted by 'unidentified individuals from Russia', not the usual border guards.

The Estonian Foreign Ministry summoned Russian Ambassador Yury Merzlyakov. The country's Foreign Minister Urmas Paet called the incident 'very alarming'

President Toomas Hendrik Ilves - who hosted Obama on his visit - stated on Facebook: 'Just back from KAPO. Confirmed that abduction occurred in the course of cross border corruption investigation.

'Documented. On Estonian soil. Russia admitted this is the work of their special services.'

Estonia claimed Kohver was arrested while probing a smuggling operation between Russia and Estonia.

Tallin Interior Minister Hanno Pevkur said he was involved in contacts with Russia over the case and initially these were 'constructive'.

'I would like to reassure all citizens of Estonia that the Estonian border is safe and living in Estonia is safe. The matter is about an incident that occurred in dealing with a smuggling count, and this is how it should be perceived.

'A smuggling case. An individual incident. And we are working to resolve it,' he said.
