It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas, at least for  Cesc Fabregas who has posted a picture so festive it could have been taken in Santa's Grotto itself.

The Chelsea playmaker was enjoying winter season with his family in what must be a department store - unless a giant mirrored reindeer and THREE Christmas trees is how they roll in the Fabregas household.

The Spaniard, who will sit out this weekend's Premier League clash with Hull through suspension, accompanied the Instagram image of himself, girlfriend Daniella Semaan and their daughter Lia with the caption: 'It's christmas time… #lovemyfamily #MissL & @4ladyd'.

The Spaniard has been inspirational in Chelsea's midfield since arriving from Barcelona in the summer

The 27-year-old has been a revelation at Stamford Bridge since his summer move from Barcelona and leads the way with 11 assists in the Premier League this season. 

Despite his recent form, manager Jose Mourinho played down Fabregas' suspension this weekend: 'He obviously has been amazing for us and is playing fantastically well but he's suspended for tomorrow so we don't think about him.

'We trust the other people that will have a chance to play.'
