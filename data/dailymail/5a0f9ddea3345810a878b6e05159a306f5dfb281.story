Offended: Natalie James, who was called a 'c***' by a salesman who lost his commission after she complained about him

A car salesman called a customer a 'moaning little c***' after losing his commission when he sold her a Vauxhall Corsa.

Natalie James bought the motor from Go Vauxhall in Croydon, south London, last year, but complained at the time about the conduct of salesman Gary Brown, who sold her the car.

Her complaint meant that Mr Brown, 37, of Croydon, did not receive the £200 commission he would normally pocket for selling the vehicle.

But more than eight months after buying the car, Miss James received a Facebook message from Mr Brown saying: 'Thought I recognised you.'The complaining little slag!'

When Ms James replied: 'Excuse me? I don't even know you?'  Mr Brown, who had spotted Ms James on a mutual friend's Facebook page, added: 'Oh yes you do. It was me that sold you the black Corsa, but then you complained about me for no reason at all and said that you didn't want to speak to me.'

'I ended up losing commission I had earned for selling the car. All because you are a moaning little c***.'

Miss James received the text messages on Friday and has contacted police, who are now believed to be investigating the comments sent to her phone.

After posting a screen grab of the offensive text messages on Twitter, Miss James wrote: 'I bought a car from Croydon @vauxhall last year.

'Today I get this in my inbox from salesman who served me. Disgusting.'

Now Mr Brown has apologised to Ms James 
about the tirade.

Tirade: Mr Brown has apologised to his former customer and called his actions 'silly and immature'

He claims he was frustrated 
because he had no idea why she complained about him.

Speaking to MailOnline, he said: 'I noticed her on a mutual friend's Facebook and thought "I remember that name".

'I was her salesman (and when the car sale was finalised) she asked not to speak to me. I have got no idea what I did, I thought we got on OK. I was hurt.

'I messaged her, which was silly and rash and immature. My intention wasn't to make her feel threatened or intimidated. It was a reaction.

'Some people find the use of the c-word more abusive than others.'

Hi Natalie,

First of all, I apologise for the abusive message I sent you yesterday.

I would have sent you this message by Facebook means, but I realise you've blocked me, which I completely understand.

I saw you on a friend's Facebook and instantly remembered who you were when I sold you a car last year.

I was gutted when you asked to speak to another salesman and had no idea what I had done to upset you so much.

Obviously that doesn't excuse my message yesterday, so I apologise for that.

All the best,

Gary Brown

He added: 'I'm an ex-soldier and you would be surprised how often that word is used in the Army.

'I didn't think of the consequences.

'I've left car sales, I don't believe I'm suited to that career.'

He added she has not responded to his apology, sent via Twitter.

Bosses at Vauxhall, which were alerted to the comments on Twitter - which have been retweeted more than 800 times - tweeted Miss James: 'We're really sorry about this & it's not something we condone in at all.

'We'll look into this & get back to you soon.'

Bosses at the firm said Mr Brown left the company in November last year to work at Wilsons, another Vauxhall dealership in Epsom, Surrey, but was no longer working there.
