After being discovered in a stack of papers in 1873 and sold on for just six shillings, the British Guiana 1c Magenta stamp is expected to fetch up to $20 million (£11.8 million) at auction.

Frequently described as ‘the most valuable stamp in the world’, the small, octagonal-shaped stamp will be sold in a one-lot auction in New York on 17 June.

It is the only surviving example of the ‘emergency’ stamps range launched by the British Guiana postmaster in 1856, and is so rare it has been previously dubbed 'the Holy Grail of stamps.'

Frequently described as 'the most valuable stamp in the world', the British Guiana 1c Magenta, pictured, will be auctioned in New York on 17 June. It is the only surviving example of the 'emergency' stamps range launched by the colony's postmaster in 1856, and was discovered by a schoolboy in Demerara in 1873

Also known as the One-Cent Magenta, the stamp was part of a shipment commissioned by the country’s postmaster when a delivery from England was delayed.

This range also included the 4c Magenta and the 4c Blue, and all the stamps were printed by the local Royal Gazette newspaper.

The 1c Magenta is printed in black on magenta paper, and features a sailing ship with the colony's Latin motto 'Damus Petimus Que Vicissim', which translates to ‘We give and expect in return.’

The stamp's country of issue - now known as Guyana - and its value is shown in small black lettering around the frame.

The British Guiana 1c Magenta was issued in 1856 by the local Royal 
Gazette newspaper.

It was later discovered in 1873 by a 12-year-old 
schoolboy in Demerara, and this location is confirmed by the stamp’s postmark. 

Reports
 claim it was sold for six shillings to a local collector and was later 
bought in 1878 by Liverpool stamp dealer Thomas Ridpath for $200 (£120).

Ridpath then sold it to Philip von Ferrary for $250 (£150) the same year. 

Arthur Hind bought it in 1922 for $36,000 (£21,000) and in 1940 it was bought for $40,000 (£23,700) by Fred Small during a private sale.   

In 1970, Small auctioned his entire stamp collection and the 1c stamp was bought by Irwin Weinberg, for $280,000 (£166,000). 

A
 decade later, John E. du Pont bought the 1c Magenta for $935,000 (£554,000) to add
 to his private collection, where it remained until his death in 2010. 

The stamp is now scheduled to be sold at auction in New York on 17 as part of du Pont’s estate for an estimated $20 million (£11.8 million). 

In March, the Expert Committee at the 
Royal Philatelic Society London gave the stamp a pre-sale estimate of 
between $10 million (£6 million) and $20 million (£11.8 million).

After close examination by six experts, including spectrometer analysis, the Committee certified the stamp as genuine.

The last time the world-famous stamp was examined was in 1935 and it has been in private collections ever since.

David Redden, director of special projects and worldwide chairman of Sotheby's Books Department, said: ‘For me, as a schoolboy stamp collector, [the 1c Magenta] was a magical object, the very definition of rarity and value, unobtainable rarity and extraordinary value.

‘That schoolboy of long ago would be bemused and astonished to think that he would one day, years later, be temporary guardian of such a world treasure.’

Following travelling exhibitions in Hong Kong and London, the British Guiana will be on display at Sotheby's in New York from 2 to 23 May.
