Federal Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has paid tribute to Wayne Goss, describing him as a great Labor man who dragged Queensland out of a decades-long malaise.

The former Queensland premier has died at the age of 63 after a long fight against brain cancer.

Mr Shorten said the Goss government modernised Queensland, acting against the police corruption that marked the Bjelke-Petersen years, decriminalising homosexuality and creating new national parks.

He was a proud Queenslander and 'great Labor man'.

'His victory in the 1989 state election marked a new era - an end to the malaise and corruption that had eaten away at Queensland's democracy in the final stretch of 32 years of conservative rule,' Mr Shorten said in a statement.

Former federal treasurer Wayne Swan - who was Queensland Labor Party state secretary during the Goss years - said he had lost a close friend and Queenslanders had lost one of their finest leaders.

Mr Goss was a leader of integrity and discipline, he said.

'Wayne changed Queensland - the state we love - for the better, and he dragged it into the sunlight after 32 years in the darkness.'

When he was elected he ended the National Party's 32-year grip on power in the state

Peter Beattie, who replaced Mr Goss as Labor leader in 1997, said Queensland had lost a man who returned honesty to the state.

'He was one of those people who made a difference. He was the Mr Clean of Queensland politics,' he told the ABC from New York.

'You can imagine what would have happened to Queensland if Wayne Goss had not run for state parliament. 

'The Fitzgerald (corruption) inquiry would have been in vain and Queensland would have slipped back to the bad old days.'

Keith de Lacy, who served as treasurer under Mr Goss, said he'd lost a very good friend.

'He had a wonderful sense of humour. It didn't come across all the time to the public and some people thought him a little aloof but that was very misleading,' he said.

Mr Goss was in charge of implementing the recommendations flowing from Queensland's landmark corruption inquiry headed by Tony Fitzgerald.

Mr Fitzgerald said he greatly admired Mr Goss, and said he was a man of uncompromising integrity.

'After he became premier, Wayne's leadership produced the reforms which transformed the state,' he said in a statement to AAP.

'Like most political reformers, he paid a heavy price.

'We've had little contact over recent years, but happily we shared a simple meal with our wives a couple of months ago when he was already gravely ill.'
