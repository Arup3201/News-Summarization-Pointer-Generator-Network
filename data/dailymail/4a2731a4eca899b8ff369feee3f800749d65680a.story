Of the many World Cup squads already announced, it is perhaps Italy’s final 23 which has caused most debate and split many opinions.

Cesare Prandelli made a surprise call to ditch striker Giuseppe Rossi, despite the Fiorentina striker seemingly back to full fitness.

But as debate continues over the Italy manager’s selection, preparation for the Azzurri’s campaign is already underway as the players posed for team photos at their training camp in Florence.

Not too sure whether to pose in full team kit or smart looking suits, the Italian squad done both as they put on their best grins for the camera.

The Italian’s full suited shoot comes after England posed for a similar photo on Sunday, but the Italians attempted to get one up on the first opponents at the World Cup with the inclusion of a smart looking waistcoat.

Although each World Cup squad contains 23 players, Italy featured a 24th man in their team photo with Andrea Ranocchia (No. 24 in team photo) on standby as a possible replacement for Andrea Barzagli who has been plagued by injury this term.
