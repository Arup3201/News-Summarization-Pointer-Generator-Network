WWE wrestler Darren Young revealed he’s gay because he wanted to be more public with his relationship.

The first openly-gay professional wrestler, Mr Young made the announcement to a reporter on a whim while waiting for luggage at Los Angeles International Airport. Though he initially regretted it, the New Jersey native now thinks it’s the best decision he’s ever made.

 Mr Young, 29, opened up about his decision and the happiness it’s brought him to People magazine, as well as wanting boyfriend Niccolo ‘Nick’ Villa to attend WWE events.

'I was tired of hiding': Darren Young came out as publicly gay because he no longer wnated to live a double life

Explaining that he was ‘tired of hiding, the wrestler told the magazine he ‘wanted to be able to take him with me to WWE functions.’

The wrestler wanted to be able to go out to dinner without looking over his shoulder, hold hands in public, the things heterosexual couples do without hesitation, he told People

The decision to come out wasn’t an easy one, Mr Young explained to People. Family and close friends found out in 2011, but he still lived a ‘double life’ that made him less happy than he felt he ought to be.

As a reporter approached him earlier this year at LAX, Mr Young decided to tell the world he’s gay. Telling People it was an ‘impulsive’ decision, the WWE star explained how he soon second-guessed his move.

The other half: Mr Young has been in a relationship with Niccolo 'Nick' Villa for about two years

‘I went straight to my hotel room and I was sick as a dog, throwing up and crying,’ said Mr Young. ‘O was terrified of how people would perceive me.’

‘I said to myself, ‘what the hell did I just do?’ Mr Young remembered.

Talking to WWE honchos helped him relax a bit, the organization stood behind him 100 per cent – and so did his wrestling partner.

‘His sexual orientation never had anything to do with him as a person, and at the end of the day it shouldn’t matter,’ Titus O’Neill told People.

It doesn't make any difference: Titus O'Neill (pictured right), Mr Young's partner in the ring, said his sexual orientation is a non-issue, that 'it shouldn't matter'

Wrestling fans, often belonging to more conservative demographics, have also supported Mr Young.His first match after his announcing he was gay couldn’t have been more uplifting.

‘At first, I didn’t know how people were going to respond to me,’ Mr Young recalled, ‘[but] the place erupted with cheers. I got goosebumps.’

The support has only grown stronger, fans have embraced the first known-gay WWE performer, which Mr Young says ‘is freaking awesome.’

The mostly positive public support has been met with online vitriol, which Mr Young lamented is a ‘daily struggle,’ but it doesn’t match the positive vibes he feels on a daily basis.

‘It’s such a good feeling to be open now,’ Mr Young said. ‘It was such a relief, I’m living the dream.’
