A young woman branded vain for wanting a lump on her throat removed says being stubborn saved her life - after the growth turned out to be cancerous.

Tove Radelius was later told she had been suffering with the disease in her thyroid - a gland in the neck - for at least a decade. 

But her requests for diagnosis and treatment had repeatedly fallen on deaf ears, with medics blaming hormones and even hypochondria.

Tove Radelius was constantly branded vain for wanting a lump on her throat removed. When she finally succeeded in getting surgery, doctors discovered it was cancerous

Miss Radelius was later told she had been suffering with the disease in her thyroid - a gland in the neck - for at least a decade

She told MailOnline: 'Doctors laughed in my face, called me vain and said it could be removed - but it would be classed as plastic surgery. 

'But you know your own body and when something isn't right and I refused to give up. 

'It is purely my own stubbornness that saved my life.'

Miss Radelius, originally from Sweden but now living in London, first noticed the growth when she was 18.

'I woke up one morning and noticed a huge lump on my throat. I got worried and started investigating what it was. 

'While it wasn't painful, it was more than 3cm in size. It later began pressing on my vocal cords and I began to sound quite hoarse.'

But despite making multiple medical appointments, her concerns were dismissed by different doctors in Sweden.

'As I was young, otherwise healthy - and did not have a troubled medical past or any illnesses in my family - they simply would not take me seriously,' she recalled. 

'One doctor even told me it was very common for young, hormonal women to have lumps on their throat, and that I should come back in two years time if it hadn't disappeared "naturally". 

Miss Radelius (pictured after surgery) first noticed the growth when she was 18. 'While it wasn't painful, it was more than 3cm in size. It later began pressing on my vocal cords and I began to sound quite hoarse'

'But I insisted it was wrong for a young a woman to have a large, unexplainable lump on her throat, and that my intuition told me something wasn't right.

'I felt like I had something foreign in my body. I didn't care what it was, I just wanted it gone. 

'One doctor it told me it could be done, but it would be "purely out of vanity",' she said.

Determined not to be fobbed off, she convinced doctors to perform a biopsy - but even then this was performed incorrectly and the results came back negative.

'All along, from most doctors I saw (which were a lot of different ones) I was treated as a young naive hypochondriac who didn't know her own body as I was too inexperienced with life,' she said.

Eventually, Miss Radelius, now 26, found another doctor who agreed to remove the growth.

'But he added it would be classified as cosmetic surgery.

'All along it was treated as completely harmless and benign.' 

After the lump was removed, tests revealed Miss Radelius was suffering from papillary thyroid cancer - the most common form of the disease which tends to strike women and younger people

It was only when the lump was sent off for testing -  a standard protocol for any growth removed - that the devastating truth emerged. 

The so-called benign lump was actually thyroid cancer - and Miss Radelius had most likely had the disease for a decade.

She said: I couldn't believe what I was hearing. It was a very traumatic situation, not helped by the doctor being very matter of fact. 

Papillary thyroid cancer is the most common type of thyroid cancer. 

About 6 out of 10 thyroid cancers diagnosed  are papillary.

This type is more common in women and in younger people. 

It is usually slow growing. But it can sometimes spread to lymph nodes in the neck or near by.

Most people with papillary thyroid cancer have no symptoms in the early stages of the disease. 

You may notice a lump in your neck. Some people may have a hoarse voice or difficulty in swallowing. 

This can be due to pressure from the cancer in the throat. 

Very occasionally, the cancer can cause a noisy type of breathing called stridor. Some people feel very tired and as though they have no energy or strength.

'No one apologised for not having taken me seriously.' 

Tests revealed Miss Radelius was suffering from papillary thyroid cancer - the most common form of the disease which tends to strike women and younger people.

Usually slow growing, it can spread to lymph nodes in the neck or near by.

While the disease often has no symptoms in the early stages, a lump, tiredness and a hoarse voice are common signs.  

Looking back, Miss Radelius says she had suffered with many of these, but due to having the disease for so long, they had become 'normal'.

'I had gone from the age of eight to 18 feeling tired and depressed, so I just thought it was normal to feel like this.

'It is only now, in retrospect, that I can see that I had depression for several years before I found the lump, and this is a common effect of thyroid illnesses.'

Surgeons confirmed she would need a second round of surgery to totally remove her thyroid - followed by radioactive iodine treatment.

Given the size of the tumour, and the growth speed of the cancer type, the surgeon estimated it began growing when she was eight years old.

She is now dependent on medication for the rest of her life to get thyroxine, the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. 

She said having cancer as a young person was 'horrible for so many reasons'. 'You have to having to deal with a a serious illness at a time of your life when things are already hard,' she said. 'You are disbelieved by the only people who can help you and should take things seriously'

Eighteen months after discovering the lump, she got the all-clear and decided to take control of her life. 

'I felt that life was too short, so I packed my bags and moved to London where I had always dreamed of living. 

'I built up a new life from scratch, began studying and moved on to work for one of the largest accounting firms, where I am currently working and studying for my professional qualifications.

'Looking back at my experience, my first advice for young people dealing with cancer, or believing that you may be affected, is to stand your ground. 

'If you feel that something is wrong, dare to say so and demand the treatment you are entitled to.

'You know your body better than anyone else and even if somebody is telling you that certain symptoms are "normal", you know your body best.

'I know this is easier said than done, but if I hadn't done so I might have either been scared off by the "cosmetic surgery" comment from the incompetent doctor, or I had waited a few years before looking into it again - and it may have been too late.'

Miss Radelius said having cancer as a young person was 'horrible for so many reasons'.

She told MailOnline: 'You have to having to deal with a a serious illness at a time of your life when things are already hard. You are disbelieved by the only people who can help you and should take things seriously.

'For thyroid cancer patients, there can be a depression caused by the unidentified thyroid problems.

'On top of this, once being diagnosed, there is the feeling you have to be an adult and be strong, not showing any signs of weakness, I have never felt so lonely and unsupported as when I had cancer. 

'It was suggested I take antidepressants to deal with it, which I don't feel was the right solution.

'You do not - and should not - have to deal with it yourself. 

'I felt that if I didn't put on a brave face, no one else would cope, so instead I broke down in tears on my own and tried to handle it all myself. 

This is not right, and the consequence of this is that my process of dealing with the emotional effects of the illness were delayed.

'There are people out there who you can speak to, who can help you through this traumatising illness. 

'As lonely as you may feel, you are not alone, there are people out there like Macmillan Cancer Support, and people like myself, who know what you are going through and want to listen and help. I wish I had known about support groups such as Macmillan.'
