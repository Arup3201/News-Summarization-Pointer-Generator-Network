Guilt: Michael Warrener was found guilty of sexually abusing three girls at Newcastle Crown Court including his daughter Claire who went on to take her own life

A tragic woman killed herself after breaking her silence about the rapes she suffered as a child at the hands of her father.

Newcastle Crown Court heard it wasn't until 2010, that Claire Warrener felt able to report the sexual abuse.

She went to the police six years after the attacks committed by her father Michael Warrener had ended.

She then took her own life when she was barely into her 20s, just months after going to the authorities.

Warrener denied one charge of indecent assault and three of rape, but was found guilty by a jury after trial.

The court had heard how he repeatedly abused Claire from when she was around 11-years-old.

Prosecutor Penny Moreland told the court how Claire, whose parents had split up, was living with her father when the abuse started.

Miss Moreland said: 'He came to her bedroom when she was asleep.'

Claire told police in her statement : 'I didn't know what had happened to me.'

After the first incident of abuse, which happened when Warrener's then girlfriend had walked out on him, Claire's ordeal got worse.

Miss Moreland said: 'The defendant again came into Claire's bedroom at night. That night he raped her.

'After that he raped her more often, as the problems in his relationship became greater, until he was having sex with her about three or four times per week.'

Jury: Tragic Claire Warrener's father Michael Warrener was found guilty at Newcastle Crown Court of repeatedly raping his daughter who committed suicide as an adult, months after reporting her childhood abuse

Miss Moreland said: 'She told the police and on March 13 [2010] she made her statement.'

Warrener was arrested and denied wrongdoing.

Miss Moreland said: 'He said she might be making the allegation up because he had accused her three weeks earlier of stealing money from him.'

Judge John Milford withdrew Warrener's bail and warned: I will sentence you, obviously, to a period of imprisonment that is going to be substantial.

'I also have to consider whether you are a dangerous offender and you will now be remanded in custody.'

Warrener was also found guilty of indecent assaults on two other child victims at yesterday's hearing.

Warrener, 59, of Twickenham Road, Sunderland, will be sentenced for all of his offending next week.
