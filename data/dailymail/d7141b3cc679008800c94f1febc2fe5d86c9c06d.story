A transgender hip-hop performer who called herself 'the Michelangelo of buttocks injections' claims she thought a British break dancer who died after their appointment was merely drunk.

Padge-Victoria Windslowe, who rapped under the name 'Black Madam,' is accused of murdering Claudia Aderotimi, 20, after an appointment at her makeshift salon in Philadelphia in 2011.

Aderotimi fell into respiratory distress immediately after Windslowe injected her with low-grade silicon and died later that night, a court has heard.   

On Thursday, Windslowe, 45, testified at her murder trial that she has been haunted by Aderotimi's death ever since. 

Charged: Windslowe is accused of killing British student Claudia Aderotimi after injecting her with industrial-grade silicone that caused heart failure

Tragic: Claudia Aderotimi, from London, died in February 2011 after receiving a silicone injection in her buttocks in her pursuit of a bigger bottom

Accused: Though she had no medical training, Windslowe (above) would charge up to £1,200 per injection

She said an intermediary informed her of the death the next morning by saying the phrase: 'R.I.P., Baby.'

'The way she said it was just ... really cold, really indifferent,' Windslowe said. 'I say that because 'R.I.P,' that rang through my soul for four years.' 

Windslowe is accused of using a mix of industrial-grade silicone and glue that spread to Ms Aderotimi's brain and lungs, causing heart failure and killing her.

She said she has injected 'thousands' of people since being trained by a doctor in Thailand and one in South America who performed her 1994 sex-change operation.

Prosecutors say Windslowe's reckless injections injured numerous clients, several of whom testified of debilitating injuries after their procedures at airport hotels and 'pumping parties' went awry.

Investigators this week told jurors Windslowe ordered silicone by the gallon and syringes by the case in a side business that she ran under the name 'Lillian.'

On the stand Thursday, Windslowe said she first went into the cosmetic surgery business in Thailand, when she was trained by a 'Dr. Chimcoke,' and ultimately opened a medical tourism business with him called 'The Secrets of the Orient.' 

Her role was to organize group trips for Americans, she said.

Her other entrepreneurial efforts have included running an escort service; making Gothic rap music under the Wrath Entertainment record label; Svengali music management services; a bail service for adult entertainers called The Risque Group; and skin care work done under the banner 'BioBeauty Labs.'

She first did the enhancements for a transgender friend in 1995.

'She (the friend) did it to help sculpt the secondary male characteristics into female, to help transsexuals pass more on the street and basically not get harassed,' Windslowe testified. 'So that's where body sculpting came from.'

Unlicensed: Windslowe is also charged with practicing medicine without a license and aggravated assault for an injection she gave another exotic dancer

She did such stellar work, she said, that people of various genders and occupations started demanding it. 

'Everyone was calling me "the Michelangelo of buttocks injections,"' Windslowe said at a pretrial hearing last week.

Police around the country have investigated at least two similar deaths involving other suspected faux surgeons, but Windslowe may be the first to be charged with murder. Prosecutors have charged her with third-degree murder, which can bring a sentence of 20 to 40 years in prison inPennsylvania.

She is also charged with aggravated assault for allegedly injuring an exotic dancer at a New Year's Eve 2011 'pumping party' in Philadelphia, when she injected a group of dancers on a dining room table. 

The woman spent two weeks in the hospital with respiratory problems, after silicone particles that moved to her lungs were too small to remove surgically.

Some former clients testified they fear the medical problems that may lie ahead.

A woman from New York testified about spending months in the hospital with respiratory distress after getting injections from Windslowe. Like others, she said she learned about her through a website and arranged the appointment through an intermediary.

Police believe Windslowe frequently switched locations and used different names to avoid detection — and fled when anyone was injured. They investigated Aderotimi's death for 18 months before filing the murder charges.
