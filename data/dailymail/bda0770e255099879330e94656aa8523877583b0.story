A mother of four has been shot dead in an alleged road rage attack as her husband drove her home from a California supermarket. 

Perla Avina, 30, was traveling in a black 1998 Toyota Camry with her partner, Mando Lopez, when they got into 'some type of confrontation' with another driver in East Oakland. 

The unidentified motorist then allegedly fired at the vehicle, causing a bullet to pierce the windscreen on the passenger side and strike Ms Avina in the face.

As the driver sped off, Mr Lopez reportedly pulled over at the 400 block of Rossmoor Avenue in Brookfield Village neighborhood, before putting pressure on his wife's face and crying: 'Wake up!'

Meanwhile, resident Dwayne Jackson, who heard the commotion, rushed outside and dialed 911. He reportedly attempted to perform first aid on Ms Avina, but she remained unconscious.

'I didn't see any signs of life. There was no waking [her] up,' Mr Jackson told NBC.

Paramedics arrived at the scene within minutes of the shooting between the 400 and 600 blocks of 98th Avenue. But despite their best efforts, Ms Avina was pronounced dead in the Camry.

And last night, the victim's grief-stricken parents, Jose and Herlinda Avina, said finding their daughter's killer is the only thing that could slightly ease their 'inconsolable pain'.

'If [anyone] knows the person who did this, please turn him in. Turn him into the police, please, please, help us,' said Mrs Avina through sobs.

Darlene Cederborg, Ms Avina's manager at the Emeryville medical clinic she worked at, added that her employee was a 'shining spirit' who 'always had a smile on her face'.

'This was a beautiful young woman with four young children and there was no reason for it. This never should have happened,' she said.
