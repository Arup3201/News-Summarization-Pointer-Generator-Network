Medical experts have called for a permanent ban on selling cigarettes to anyone born in this century in a bid to eradicate smoking from Britain entirely.  

The radical plan would see the age limit for buying tobacco - currently set at 18 - rise every year until the last cigarette smokers died out, at which point smoking would be illegal for everyone.  

Doctors have asked the powerful British Medical Association to lobby the Government for a ban on tobacco sales to people born after the year 2000.  

Smoking kills more than 100,000 people a year in the UK by causing diseases such as lung cancer and emphesyma, according to the NHS.  

Crackdown: Doctors have called for a permanent ban on selling cigarettes to anyone born after the year 2000

While rates of cigarette smoking have been falling in Britain for decades, around 20 per cent of people still smoke despite anti-tobacco measures such as the ban on smoking inside.  

At the BMA's public health conference in London last week, doctors urged the Government to bring in draconian measures which will stop young people smoking in the first place.  

'Humanity has never developed anything more deadly than the cigarette,' said Tim Crocker-Buqué, a registrar working in Tower Hamlets.  

'The combination of its addictive power and devastating health effects combined with historical social norms and powerful advertising campaigns killed 100million people in the 20th century.  

'The continuing epidemic is predicted to kill hundreds of millions more over the 21st century.'  

Plea: The calls were led by Dr Tim Crocker-Buqué, a registrar from East Londo

He cited statistics showing that 80 per cent of smokers start when they are teenagers, and that someone who starts smoking aged 15 is three times as likely to die of a related cancer than smokers who start in their 20s.  

'This is a highly addictive product that kills 50 per cent of the users and it is so patently over the balance of harm that we must now work to prevent the next generation from falling into the nicotine trap,' Dr Crocker-Buqué added.  

'I do not want our children smoking and nor should anybody else. If they haven't already started, then let's keep them smoke free for life.'

Senior doctor Mark Temple agreed, 
saying: 'If we prevent access to a group that is growing older through 
time then gradually we will stop easy access to tobacco products.'

Currently
 retailers are barred from selling cigarettes or other tobacco products 
to anyone under the age of 18, with fines of up to £2,500 for anyone 
caught selling to children, enforced by local trading standards 
agencies.

If the 
proposed legislation came into effect, the existing ban would be 
replaced by a prohibition on selling tobacco to anyone born on or after 
January 1, 2000.

However,
 public health expert Iain Kennedy suggested that the policy would prove
 unworkable and claimed it was 'nonsensical' to target one age group 
rather than embarking on wider anti-tobacco efforts.

Controversy: One famous case of tobacco companies' wrongdoing was dramatised in the 1999 Hollywood film The Insider, starring Russell Crowe

The BMA conference also heard calls for local councils in Britain to withdraw all their investments from funds connected to tobacco companies.  

Taavi Tillmann said that local authorities' pension funds had more than £1billion invested in smoking-related funds, despite their duty to improve the health of their constituents.  

He added: 'This obviously creates a gross conflict of interest if ever there was one, whereby practitioners have to choose in a methodological fashion between maximising the health of their population on the one hand against maximising their income on retirement on the other hand.'  

The tobacco industry is immensely profitable but has long been controversial thanks to repeated allegations of wrongdoing such as deliberately marketing cigarettes to children.  

One of the most high-profile cases, when tobacco firm Brown & Williamson allegedly worked to make their cigarettes more addictive, was exposed by whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand and later dramatised in 1999 Hollywood hit The Insider, starring Russell Crowe.
