The father who allegedly stabbed his three-year-old son has been charged with his murder.

On Tuesday about 9am, South Australia police were at an unrelated crash scene at the intersection of Hockley Terrace and Gorge Road in Athelstone - north-east of Adelaide - when they were approached by a man stating he had injured his son.

Police found the injured boy in the Stepney father's car and he was taken to the Women's and Children's Hospital.

The boy died at the hospital as a result of his injuries.

'It is an absolute tragedy that a little boy has lost his life in these circumstances,' Superintendent Graeme Adcock said.

'We are in the very early stages of the investigation, so I am limited in what I can say.

'However, I can confirm that an autopsy will be carried out tomorrow to determine the exact cause of death.'

A SA police officer called it a 'tragic set of circumstances' while briefing the media earlier on Tuesday

The Eastern Adelaide Local Service Area officer-in-charge said the boy's wounds were consistent with being stabbed.

Superintendent Adcock said the 36-year-old - who was charged on Tuesday afternoon - remained in hospital and would undergo surgery for serious but non-life-threatening injuries to the neck.

'Police are unable to interview him until 24 hours after surgery,' he said.

'Understandably, the boy's mother is overcome by grief and police have not yet been able to take a statement from her.'

Superintendent Adcock added the mother would receive every possible support available from police.

'At this stage of the investigation, there is no indication of any history of domestic violence. However, we will continue to examine that as the investigation progresses,' he said.

Only half an hour before the father flagged down the police, the boy's mother had reported her son missing, saying she had grave concerns for his safety.

Police have told of the moment they found a three-year-old boy dying from stab wounds in the back of his father's car.

Adelaide Advertiser reported the boy was stabbed multiple times by his father, 36, at their home in Stepney - about eight kilometres away - before he was put in a car and driven away.

'It's a tragic set of circumstances and our sympathies go out to the family,' a SA police spokesman said earlier on Tuesday.

'It was also a difficult incident for the police and the ambulance officers.'

Police said they did not know the man's final destination and the family was not known to them.

Anyone who may have seen the man's black Volkswagen ute heading from Stepney to Athelstone on Tuesday morning is urged to contact police.

Earlier in the day, Gorge Road between Ryan Avenue and Coulls Road was closed to traffic due to the incident.

A Gorge Road business owner - who did not wish to be identified - said the area had been 'crawling' with police officers all morning.

'No one really knows what happened,' he said.

'It's just been one of those days that happens anywhere in the world and today it's happening in Athelstone.'

Eastern Adelaide police and Major Crimes are investigating the incident.
