A disabled man who was trapped underneath his mobility scooter when it overturned on a busy road was forced to lie there for 30 minutes - after dozens of heartless motorists drove around him.

Helpless Nickie Churchard, 26, fell off his mobility scooter after his bag got trapped on the reverse switch and caused it to topple over.

But it took half an hour before someone took pity on him and came to rescue him, as cars swerved to avoid the volunteer worker.

Mr Churchard was left wedged under the machine in the middle of Gold Street in Desborough, Northamptonshire, for 30 minutes after the accident on September 11.

Shockingly passersby completely ignored Nickie’s shouts for help with some cars deliberately driving around him.

Mr Churchard, also from Desborough, Northamptonshire, said: 'I felt very vulnerable and scared as cars were basically swerving round me.

'It’s not normal to see someone lying in the road trapped, but I was there for 25 minutes while cars and people passed me by.

'I shouted out to them and they just ignored me.'

Nickie was left with no feeling in his left knee after a motorcycle accident in 2002.

He spent three months in a coma and doctors warned his devastated mum Janice Tinsley, 55, he only had a slim chance of survival.

After a hoard of pedestrians and cars failed to stop and help him, eventually a good samaritan came to his aid.

Nickie pulled tendons in his leg as a result of the fall from the scooter - which happened when he was heading home from a volunteer shift at a local community centre.

Disgusted mum Janice said: 'I was utterly gobsmacked.

'It’s shameful that so many people didn’t stop to help him out, and the fact that it was in our own street, where people know him, adds insult to injury.

'I am thoroughly disheartened with the lack of compassion that was shown and I was appalled by the reaction of the so-called community here.

'There was no chance of Nickie getting up on his own. The Paralympics makes you more aware of disability but obviously not for some people.'
