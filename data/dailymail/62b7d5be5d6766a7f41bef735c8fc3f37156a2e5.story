Britain should leave the European human rights system if it will not repeal the ban on prisoners’ voting, its most senior official has declared.

By continuing to defy the ruling allowing prisoners to vote, Niels Muižnieks, human rights commissioner at the Council of Europe, said the whole system might ‘unravel.’

His strong letter to Nick Gibb MP, who chairs the parliamentary committee looking at the draft prisoners voting bill, is likely to escalate the simmering row with Strasbourg over the issue.

Warning: Europe's most senior human rights official said that the European Court of Human Rights, pictured, must be obeyed

He wrote: ‘If the UK, a founding member of the Council of Europe and one which has lost relatively few cases at the Court, decides to ‘cherry pick’ and selectively implement judgments, other states will invariably follow suit and the system will unravel very quickly.

‘Thus, my message is clear: the Court's judgments have to be executed and the automatic and indiscriminate ban on voting rights for prisoners should be repealed. If the court system is to continue to provide protection, there is no alternative to this for member states, other than leaving the system itself.’

The Council of Europe which has 47 members, operates the controversial European Court of Human Rights, which ruled in 2005 that banning all prisoners from voting was unlawful.

But ministers have resisted changing the law with MPs voting by an overwhelming majority two years ago to maintain the status quo.

David Cameron said in November 2010: ‘It makes me physically ill to even contemplate having to give the vote to anyone in prison’.

And last year he insisted: ‘No one should be under any doubt – prisoners are not getting the vote under this government.’

Last night Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘Mr Muiznieks is desperate to defend the international gravy train he has made a living out of.

'I suspect the bleatings of a career European quangocrat will only stiffen the spine of MPs who want to defend British democracy, not European bureaucracy.’

Defiant: Tory MP Dominic Raab said the warning would 'stiffen the spine' of MPs who want to resist Europe's power over them

A ruling by the UK Supreme Court this week dismissed an appeal by two murderers who claimed it was a breach of both the Human Rights Act and EU law to ban them from voting.

But, in a significant blow to David Cameron, the judges failed to rule that the UK’s existing blanket ban on prisoners taking part in elections is lawful.

The verdict will thus intensify the pressure on ministers to grant at least some convicts the vote – or risk handing out millions in compensation for breaching their ‘rights’.

Mr Muižnieks comments were published in evidence to the joint Commons and Lords parliamentary committee considering the prisoner votes, which published a draft bill last year.

The bill sets out three options: a ban for prisoners sentenced to four years or more, a ban for prisoners sentenced to more than six months, or continuing to defy Strasbourg.

Mr Muižnieks' letter adds: ‘A withdrawal from the ECHR would cast doubt on the UK's commitment to UN values and acceptance of UN mechanisms such as the Universal Periodic Review and treaty monitoring bodies.

'The UK's voice with regard to human rights issues in other countries would clearly be less credible.’

Russia, Turkey, Ukraine and Albania are all members of the Council of Europe. The only European nation that refuses to join is Belarus, whose human rights record has been widely criticised.

At the Tory Party conference last month, Home Secretary Theresa May and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling suggested a future Tory government could leave the Strasbourg court.Britain has lost 202 cases at the European Court of Human Rights since 1998. The people who brought the cases, who included criminals, received £1.7million in compensation.

The total bill, including legal costs, is around £4.4million.
