In one of her latest presenting roles, Davina McCall helps reunite families who have been torn apart by time and difficult circumstances.

It's a subject that's close to home for Davina, as her relationship with her own mother, Florence, was strained after she left her to be raised by her grandparents. 

Now the TV presenter has opened up about how she feels towards her estranged parent - who died in 2008.

Difficult childhood: Davina has admitted all she ever wanted from her mother was a cuddle

She told the Daily Telegraph's Judith Woods: 'I never doubted for a moment that she loved me. It was almost a relief when she was gone and I could stop asking her to be something that she just couldn't be.' 

She added: 'Motherhood is about being selfless, to some degree, and she just needed to be the centre of attention.'

The 46-year-old explained that all she ever really wanted from her mother was 'a protective cuddle', and she makes up for never getting this by giving her own children, Holly, 12, Tilly, 10, and Chester, seven, plenty of affection.

Rock solid: The presenter said her marriage to Matthew Robertson remains a happy one

'That's why it takes me so long to put my kids to bed every night; I need to hold them,' she said.

Speaking of her 14-year marriage to Matthew Robertson, she said they are 'rock solid' following reports that she refused to do Strictly Come Dancing in case it put too much strain on their relationship.

Setting the record straight, Davina clarified that she didn't want to do anything that would take her away from her family for too long. 

'I'm very lucky to be able to achieve a work/life balance that most working mums can't, but when I get the balance wrong, it makes me melancholy, which isn't who I am,' she said.

As a result, she ensures her work - including the aforementioned Long Lost Family for ITV and The Million Pound Drop for Channel 4 - doesn't get in the way of the school run to and from their home in East Sussex.

She did make an exception to this rule when she did her gruelling Sport Relief challenge earlier this year, which involved cycling, swimming and running 500 miles from Edinburgh to London in seven days. 

Despite being super fit, the challenge took its toll on Davina, and viewers were alarmed when she collapsed following her swim across freezing Lake Windermere in Cumbria.

But she showed her mettle as she battled on to complete the challenge - raising thousands of pounds in the process. 

Despite the ordeal, it hasn't put the mother-of-three off pushing herself to keep fit. But she's currently being active in a less intense way as an ambassador for Sky Ride - a campaign between Sky and British Cycling which is aiming to get more people on their bikes.
