Despite concerns, Rattigan did 
receive a CBE in 1958 but was knighted only in 1971, four years after 
homosexuality was eventually legalised

The plays of Sir Terence Rattigan are known as tirades against what he saw as the sexual hypocrisy of the British Establishment.

Now newly released papers reveal his homosexuality nearly cost him a place on the Honours List and almost certainly delayed his knighthood.

The word ‘homo’ was even written on documents concerning a recommendation that Rattigan – best known for The Winslow Boy and Separate Tables – be included on the Birthday Honours List of 1958.

His case was recorded as causing ‘difficulties!’ for civil servants and ‘divided views’ at a time when homosexuality was still illegal.

Experts last night said it was unlikely the reference to ‘difficulties’ and ‘homo’ could refer to anything other than Rattigan’s private life.

Geoffrey Wansell, of the Terence Rattigan Society, said: ‘I don’t see what other difficulties these people could have had in mind. He wasn’t brazen about his sexuality because it was against the law.

'But I don’t think there was any question in the minds of  people who knew him that he was gay.’

The papers, obtained by this newspaper under Freedom of Information laws, contain several redactions, and do not specify which honour Rattigan was being considered for.

But the letters ‘CBE’ have been scribbled next to his name, implying that he may have initially been recommended for a knighthood but then downgraded.

In any other circumstances, Rattigan, who was 46 in 1958, would appear to have been an obvious choice for an honour, given his long list of stage  and screen successes.

But his recommendation came  at a time when homosexuality was still illegal and public opinion remained  bitterly divided on the issue.

In the late 1950s, as many as 1,000 men a year were being jailed for the offence, with high-profile convictions including actor John Gielgud and motor museum founder Lord Montagu of Beaulieu.

Michael Darlow, author of the book Terence Rattigan: The Man And His Work, said: ‘The police were beginning to crack down on anyone who spoke out in favour of a relaxation of a law.

'You can imagine, in that climate, officials would have thought twice about honouring someone who was homosexual.’

Rattigan had numerous lovers but no long-term partner and his sexuality would have been no secret to his friends or theatrical peers.

It is possible officials may have put their initial concerns to one side in 1958 following the publication of the Wolfenden Report in 1957 which recommended that the laws on same-sex relationships should be reformed.

Rattigan died in 1977, but revivals of his work have included a 2011 West End production of Flare Path, starring Sienna Miller and Sheridan Smith, and the National Theatre’s acclaimed 2010 production of After The Dance, with Benedict Cumberbatch.

A movie version of Rattigan’s play The Deep Blue Sea, starring Rachel Weisz, was released in 2011.
