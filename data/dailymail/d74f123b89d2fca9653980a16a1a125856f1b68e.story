Horrific: Dana Vulin (pictured), 28, was left with 60 per cent burns to her body, which were so severe that her neck fused to her chest, the court heard

An Australian woman has described the moment a 'love rival turned her into a human fireball' because she believed the blonde was having an affair with her estranged husband.

Dana Vulin, 28, claimed Natalie Dimitrovska, 29, stormed uninvited into her flat last February and demanded to know where her on-off spouse Edin Handanovic was hiding.

But when convicted drug user Vulin said she didn't know, Dimitrovska allegedly hurled a bottle of methylated spirits over her while she was holding a lamp used for smoking crystal meth.

Vulin said the alleged attack followed a campaign and harassment, including one phone call in which Dimitrovska told her: 'I'm going to ruin your pretty little face.'

'I was pretty much instantly on fire,' a weeping Vulin told Western Australia's District Court. 'I was a human fireball.'

'The moment I was on fire, [Dimitrovska and a male accomplice] just laughed and ran out of my apartment,' she added.

The horrifying incident took place on February 16 this year. Vulin was left with 60 per cent burns to her body, which were so severe that her neck fused to her chest, the court heard.

Describing the incident in detail, 
Vulin told the court she was sleeping on her sofa in Perth, Western 
Australia, when she was awoken by a woman's voice saying: 'Hello Dana'.

She looked up to see Natalie Dimitrovska, 28, standing over her with a man named in court as Daniel Stone.

As
the row grew more heated, Dimitrovska picked up a crack pipe that 
belonged to Vulin and an open-flame lamp and began smoking 
methylamphetamine.

Ms Vulin said she took the lamp off Ms Dimitrovska and told her to get out of her flat.

She said Dimitrovska then turned to Stone, who replied: 'You know what I think, the b**** is full of s***’,' Ms Vulin said.

That was when Ms Dimitrovska allegedly picked up a bottle of methylated spirits, yelled at Ms Vulin and threw the liquid at her.

'I
screamed 'help me, help me, help me',' she told the court, describing 
how she rolled on the floor and poured water over herself in an attempt 
to put the flames out.

But nobody came.

Eventually a neighbour discovered her lying in the shower and called emergency services.

She said she had met Mr Handanovic on New Year’s Eve 2011 at a casino and met him again at a later date.

She said she then received a phone call from Dimitrovska saying the couple were back together and that she should 'watch her back'.

'[She told me] that she knew about my previous [drugs] charges and 
that she hoped I would rot in my jail cell,' Vulin told the court.

'She told me things like she was going to bash my head in.'

Describing her life now as a 'daily battle, she added: 'I haven't even showered myself or changed myself in 18 months.'

In her opening address on Monday morning, prosecutor Linda Petrusa said Dimitrovska was arrested at Perth International Airport allegedly trying to flee the country, having even dyed her hair from brunette to blonde.

Dimitrovska denies the charges. The case continues.
