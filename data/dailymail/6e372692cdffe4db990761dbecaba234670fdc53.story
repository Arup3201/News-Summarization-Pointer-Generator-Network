It was an arctic blast that put Chicagoans in a pretty bad mood - a 37-hour marathon of  temperatures well-below zero.

But what came after was a shivering city blanketed in white, and a photographer managed to capture a unique look at the landmarks Chicago is known for following the storm.

Colin Hinkle of Soaring Badger Productions used a GoPro camera strapped to a to a DJI Phantom 2 drone that he launched in different parts of 'Chiberia', as it is often called.

'Enjoy the beauty of a frigid Chicago from your warmth of your living room,' Hinkle posted underneath the footage he posted on YouTube.

Hinkle shot the video over the course of two weeks in January, according to News Mic, which described the result as 'hauntingly beautiful'.

The footage shows glimpses of the downtown skyline, CTA trains, Lake Michigan, Adler Planetarium, Northerly Island and the Chicago River.

It also features the Maggie Daley Park skating ribbon, which was only recently constructed.
