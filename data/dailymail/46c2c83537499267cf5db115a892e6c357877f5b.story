'Monster': Warren Earl Yerger Sr., 51, is being held on $1million bail after being charged with more than 500 criminal counts of sexual abuse involving four children

A Pennsylvania couple and another woman have been charged with physically and sexually abusing four children in their care for more than two decades.

Warren Earl Yerger Sr., 51, of Douglassville, faces more than 500 criminal charges in connection with the alleged crimes against three girls and a boy, including rape, involuntary deviant sexual intercourse, aggravated indecent assault and corruption of minors.

Chester County District Attorney Tom Hogan said Friday that Yerger's wife, 34-year-old Leslie Yerger, a company payroll supervisor, and one-time girlfriend 46-year-old Deborah Keeley, a secretary, also face multiple counts including sex crimes and corruption of minors.

Officials say the children were as young as 3 and the abuse occurred at residences in Chester, Berks, McKean and Montgomery counties between 1989 and 2012.

The three defendants were booked into the Chester County Prison. Mr Yerger, a security guard, is being held on $1million bail. A judge set bail for the two women at $500,000 each.

According to allegations made public Friday, the children were subjected to anal rape and digital penetration, forced to perform sex acts on adults and each other, and also required to take part in sexual encounters between the suspects, Philly.com reported.

'This was, in every way possible, a living, walking breathing nightmare for these victims,' Chester County District Attorney Thomas Hogan told CBS Philly.

Officials say the Yergers and Keeley also took and distributed pornographic photos of the young victims, according to ABC 6 Action News.

The abuse went beyond sexual acts, 
according to the prosecutor's office. The four children were also 
allegedly punched and kicked by their tormentors.

‘These defendants essentially tortured children in their care for years. They degraded these victims in every way possible,’ said Hogan.

The male victim told police that Warren Yerger fondled him until 1993, when he turned 8 years old. Around that time, Yerger allegedly broke the boy’s nose after kicking him in the face in order to ‘beat the evil out of him,’ The Mercury reported.

Warren Yerger would sometimes tell people he was saying nightly prayers with two of the victims, but instead he would lock the children’s bedrooms and assault them, officials said.

Between 2001 and 2010, police say Mr Yerger forced two of the kids in his care into daily routines of sexual abuse.

In 2012, one of the female victims told police that Yerger would leave her money after he allegedly sexually assaulted her.

‘Yerger has been charged with every legally appropriate charge for sexually abusing these children,’ said Hogan. ‘There is no charge that exists for it, but he ought to be charged with murdering the childhood of these victims.’
