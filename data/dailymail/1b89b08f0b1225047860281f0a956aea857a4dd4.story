Jockey Barry Geraghty has insisted he detected the same fire and racing desire burning within Sprinter Sacre as the 2013 Queen Mother Champion Chase winner stepped on a racecourse for the first time in over a year.

The rider’s enthusiastic reaction was one of the reasons Ladbrokes took the dramatic reaction of slashing Sprinter Sacre’s odds of regaining the Champion Chase crown in March to 2-1 favourite from 7-2. Sponsors Betway make him a 3-1 shot.

The plan now is to run Sprinter Sacre in the Clarence House Chase at Ascot on January 17.

Geraghty spoke after riding the Nicky Henderson-trained eight-year-old for the first time since he was pulled up suffering from a fibrillating heart in the Desert Orchid Chase at last year’s Kempton Christmas meeting.

The pair worked over a mile and five furlongs of the Berkshire track, jumping five fences down the back straight before being allowed to stride clear of his lead horse, Nico de Boinville-ridden Tanks For That, up the home straight.

Geraghty added that a mistake at the second fence, when Sprinter Sacre took off far too soon, was also a positive.

The Irish jockey said: ‘I was meeting (the fence) a little long and Sprinter fancied it a bit and came up out of my hands. If he had put in a short stride I would be more worried. You’d have said he is not as boisterous as he was.

‘He was full of it. That is what I would have expected 13 months ago.’

Despite no repeats of the heart problem since the Kempton incident, Henderson had taken the precaution of having equine cardiology specialist Celia Marr, who has treated Sprinter Sacre, present.

The trainer said he had been keen to clear any psychological hurdles Sprinter Sacre might have faced on his return to a racecourse.

He added: ‘You have to bear in mind it is an horrendous experience for him. The worry is it leaves a scar. That was why we wanted this public experience.

‘It needed to be on a race day to have some atmosphere rather than coming tomorrow morning and going around on his own.

‘We had to make sure he has gone through a barrier he was comfortable with. That will surely give him confidence. He can now gallop away happily and that was the object of the exercise. He enjoyed himself which was the important thing.'

John Ferguson thinks Challow Hurdle winner Parlour Games could be the best jumper he has trained after his win over Vyta Du Roc. The gelding is 10-1 for the Neptune Investment Novices’ Hurdle.

Henderson conceded that the path to recovery has been far form smooth adding: ‘We were struggling at the beginning of the season and it hasn’t all been that easy so far. It has taken a bit longer than you would have liked but you have to be patient.

‘We now have roughly three weeks until Ascot so has three more good pieces of work to do.’

Meanwhile, Henderson insisted he and Geraghty were satisfied with 2013 Gold Cup winner Bobs Worth despite his last place finish behind Road To Riches in the Lexus Chase at Leopardstown on Sunday.

It was the gelding’s first run since winning the race 12 months earlier and he is now likely to head straight to the Gold Cup in March.

Henderson said: ‘We were happy. Barry said he felt fantastic and jumped great but the ground was as holding as they have had it there for a long time and he doesn’t like it.

‘If he jumps as well on better ground, we are in the ball game.’

Trainer Nicky Henderson gives Sprinter Sacre a once over after a workout at Newbury

Henderson and Geraghty went on to land a double at Newbury with Clean Sheet and Top Notch.

The latter strengthened the trainer’s hand in the Triumph Hurdle when beating Mick Jazz four and a half lengths despite carrying 10lb more in the juvenile hurdle.

Joint owners Simon Munir and Isaac Souede are also building a formidable Triumph team which also includes Henderson’s Peace And Co and Bristol De Mai, the Nigel Twiston-Davies-trained winner of the Finale Hurdle at Chepstow on Saturday.
