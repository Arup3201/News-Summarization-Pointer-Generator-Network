Spend hours in the gym carving out abs good enough to grate cheese on but nowhere to show them off?

Well maybe your body ifs good enough to be on the books of a new model agency called Ripped.

As the name suggests, it's looking for well honed men and women who have an athletic body they want to showcase.

How do you get noticed? Founder  James said it goes without saying that you have to have an amazing figure to be apart of the agency

The agency describes itself as an 'elite group of the UKâ€™s fittest male and female fitness models and bodybuilders who either work in the fitness industry, are passionate about sports, are competitive bodybuilders or simply live for their next workout.'

Ripped claims it's at the very cutting edge of fitness and specialise in fitness, underwear, sports, physique and fashion modelling.

A lot of the 60 models on its books, who range from a 16-year-old to a 38-year-old, also go on to do swimwear, sportswear, protein bars and vitamin range campaigns.

Most of the talent work as bodybuilders, circus performers, boxers, martial artists, fire-breathers and fire fighters and model in their free time.

In shape: Speaking about the agency, the founder described fitness modelling as an 'art-form'

The agency don't charge the models to be listed on its website and claim to only take a small commission when one of their models gets signed for a job.

Speaking about setting up the agency, founder James Bishop said: 'I have always believed in physical fitness as a way of de-stressing and as a way of getting some good, quality time to yourself.

'I also enjoy seeing the results it brings. So, I decided to open the agency and it has gone from strength to strength in the short time it has been open.'

'Fitness modelling is an art-form,' he added. 'Just as an artist will put all his efforts into the final product, so do our guys and girls. They spend hours in the gym most days to reach perfection - and this is what our clients want.

'There are huge numbers of underwear brands, fitness equipment manufacturers and fashion labels who want models who are at the peak of their physical fitness.

'They want guys with abs of steel, powerful pecs and muscles on top of their muscles and ripped or defined girls who are the picture of health and fitness.

'Our models are dedicated to their training. Most of them work out in the gym as the basics, most supplement this with running, team sports and swimming. Some of our guys and girls are professional athletes and of course, some have full-time jobs. We have a firefighter, a serving soldier and, of course, we have lots of personal trainers on our books.

'There has been lots of media attention in recent years about the negative effect of using size-zero models, and there will always be a stereotype that models exist on one lettuce leaf a day.

'Our guys and girls are the opposite. They can eat up to 6,000 calories of nutritional - this is the keyword - food a day, but of course they burn it off through their exercise and training, leaving an amazing body which can potentially earn them thousands.'

Speaking about the agency and getting noticed, James said: 'It goes without saying that you have to have an amazing figure. With guys, you can be a huge man-mountain of muscle like a really huge bodybuilder, or you can be slim and defined.

Here come the girls: For girls to get noticed, James said you can be petite and slim, or again, bigger defined bodybuilders adding that 'as long as you look amazing, you will be fine'

'What you must have are impressive abs though, this is the true mark of a fitness model.

'For girls, you can be petite and slim, or again, bigger defined bodybuilders. As long as you look amazing, you will be fine.

'What sets us apart though is that we insist you are fun to work with, and are down to earth. We don't put up with divas and neither do we think much to dull personalities.

'If you look good, know how to stay calm and happy, love showing off your body then please get in touch.'
