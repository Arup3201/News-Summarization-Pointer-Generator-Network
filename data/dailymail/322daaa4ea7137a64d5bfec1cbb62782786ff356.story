Even the most casual of viewers of the Olympics over the past two weeks could not have failed to spot the luminous yellow trainers that seemed to be worn by almost every athlete at the Games.

The unmissable neon footwear dominated at the Olympic track and field events - with the most high profile outing of all being the moment Mo Farah sped to success in the 5,000 and 10,000 metres wearing the yellow spikes - amid a sea of fellow runners wearing identical pairs.

In fact, an incredible tally of more than 400 athletes wore the brightly coloured trainers - meaning that barely an event went by without them making an appearance.

A sea of yellow: Almost all the athletes in the men's 5,000 metres wore the Nike Volt running shoes - including twice Olympic champion Mo Farah, front right

Gold standard: Mo Farah speeds to victory in the 5,000m - adding to his 10,000m success earlier in the week

Of those 400, 68 athletes won medals - including a gold tally of 25.

The gold-standard kit in question was the high-tech Nike Volt range - a collection of footwear designed especially for the Olympics by Nike.

The collection covered footwear for athletes taking part in events on track, field and road, and a handful in boxing and fencing too.

The trainers are tailored for each individual event, with 16 variations in total. 

Sprinters chose from a selection of four different spikes, including the
Nike Zoom Superfly R4, a shoe that
fuses Nike's revolutionary Flywire technology - a featherlight woven fabric that provides a dynamic, sock-like fit - with a lightweight spike plate.

Winning style: The high performance shoes are described as Nike's lightest, fastest spike ever

Mo Farah raced to gold in the 5,000m 
and 10,000m wearing the Zoom Victory Elite, one of three spikes created 
especially for distance runners.

Nike report that the Zoom Victory Elite 
is the lightest, fastest 1,500m race spike they have ever made, combining what they describe as an ultra-responsive carbon plate with the dynamic Nike Flywire upper.

For marathon runners, they created 
the Nike Flyknit Racer, an ultra-lightweight trainer 'knitted' from 
single lengths of high-tech thread meaning no bulk, virtually no seams 
and no superfluous weight.

The
marathon shoe weighs just 5.6 ounces for a size 9, and is engineered for a 
precision fit to create a feeling of a second skin for the endurance 
athletes for whom comfort is paramount.

Nike say that the Flyknit Racer conforms with their commitment to combining 'high performance with environmentally sustainable design', because the knitted part of the upper does 
not use cuts of multiple materials and sections found in traditional 
sports footwear, thus reducing waste in the manufacturing process.

So not only are the Nike Volt's bright yellow - they're green too.

The 
Flyknit collection is available at Nike stores now, priced £150, while 
the Volt sprint and distance spikes will be available to buy on 1 
October price tbc.
