Animals that have been abused, murdered and otherwise mistreated could get court representation if one legislator has her way.

Connecticut State Representative Diana Urban recently proposed a bill that would allow the appointment of an advocate to act on behalf of an animal during court proceedings.

Urban began promoting her bill, known as HB 6310, ‘An Act Concerning Animal Advocates in Court Proceedings’ on Thursday.

Animal representation: Connecticut State Representative Diana recently proposed a bill that would allow the appointment of an advocate to act on behalf of an animal during court proceedings

First step: Urban began promoting her bill, known as HB 6310, 'An Act Concerning Animal Advocates in Court Proceedings' on Thursday

The law, if enacted, would allow a veterinarian with the Department of Agriculture to serve as an advocate for an animal whose welfare or custody is the subject of a civil or criminal trial.

‘HB 6310 would give the option for an advocate in court for an egregiously injured animal,’ Urban, a Democrat from North Stonington, Connecticut, told NBC News.

‘This would enable the animal's injury to be identified as a red flag for future violent behavior.

'We are putting together a public/private partnership with the state Department of Agriculture and nonprofit rescue groups including Connecticut Votes for Animals to be available to speak for the animals in court,’ she said.

Urban was joined at a press conference on Thursday by Asa Palmer, a high school student from North Stonington, Connecticut, who discovered two of his family’s cows shot in the face in January.

One of the injured cows had to be euthanized.

‘If this was in place today, Asa Palmer could request an advocate for his young cow, “Angel,” who was shot in the face and left with her jaw hanging off,’ Urban said.

Two men have been charged in the shooting of the cows on the Palmer family’s farm.

Urban’s bill has received the support of other lawmakers.

‘Much like our children who cannot advocate on behalf of themselves, innocent animals that are abused or worse, killed, deserve that same right,’ Representative Brenda Kupchick, a Republican from Fairfield, Connecticut, told NBC.

‘Violence of any type is unacceptable and we must do whatever we can to give a voice to those who cannot speak for themselves."

Uban’s bill is awaiting action in the legislature's Judiciary Committee. It is unclear whether the Judiciary Committee will take action on the bill.
