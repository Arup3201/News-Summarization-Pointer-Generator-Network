How Gareth Southgate would settle for this next summer. England playing with swagger, passing and moving with purpose and putting Portugal to the sword.

These two nations will meet again on June 18, in the Czech town of Uherske Hradste, to begin the proceedings of Group B in Euro 2015. Inevitably, the sides will look a little different but if the result is the same, the Under 21 head coach will be over the moon.

England ran out 3-1 convincing winners, thanks to goals Danny Ings (two) and Carl Jenkinson, pleasing Southgate in the process. Having secured their place at the tournament impressively against Croatia last month, here was another step forward in the right direction.

Southgate is not someone who gets carried away but even he would accept that the numbers England are putting together ahead of their defining test are impressive: this was their eleventh straight success and the 13th unbeaten game on his watch.

Portugal were unbeaten in 15 games prior to Thursday night, and more tests beckons against France – in Brest next Monday – before the Czech Republic and Germany await in March.

But the confidence which is currently in this group is sending them a long way. Every member is desperate to make an impression.

‘I was very pleased, particularly given the quality of the opposition,’ said Southgate. ‘The result was important because they are the best team that we have played. There are some things that we can improve but we looked a threat.’

With Saido Berahino on senior duty and Harry Kane starting on the bench, Ings grasped his opportunity on home turf to make an impression, going close in the first attack with a flashing header before he opening the scoring in the sixth minute, turning in a cross from Tom Ince.

Ings, the Burnley striker, has struggled for regular starts at this level but his performance was full of energy and endeavour and he kept trying to stretch Portugal, with his runs in behind their defence. His work ethic was to be admired.

‘I’m delighted for him,’ said Southgate. ‘It is great that we have got three Premier League strikers to choose from. His first contribution was beating five men and nearly scoring with a header. Danny was excellent.’ 

For all their superiority, though, England’s second goal didn’t arrive until the stroke of half-time. Again they opened Portugal up with quick interchanges, the move culminating when Will Hughes picked out Jenkinson, who confidently finished from 12 yards.

Portugal, to their credit, came out with intent in the second period and took advantage of a weak header by Luke Garbutt in the 48th minute when Bernardo Silva waltzed through, firing his shot between Jack Butland’s legs.

Any chance that Portugal would stage a rally, however, were soon snuffed out when Ings capped a fine evening, bundling in from close range after Norwich winger Nathan Redmond had scurried to the byline and picked him out. It was a fitting end to a satisfying night.
