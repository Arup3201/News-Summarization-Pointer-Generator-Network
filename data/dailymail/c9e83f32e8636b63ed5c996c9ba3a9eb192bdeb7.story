Prisons have spent almost £1million hiring interpreters for the burgeoning population of foreign criminals in British jails.

New figures for jails in England and Wales show that interpreters were needed 14,138 times last year.

Twelve per cent of prisoners in English and Welsh jails are foreign, with Polish, Irish and Jamaican inmates the most common. 

Call-outs: Government figures show interpreters were called on almost 15,000 times last year

Each interpreter visit can cost the taxpayer as much as £1,200, leading to claims the cost of the justice system could 'spiral out of control', the Sun reported.

The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) figures were brought to light by a Parliamentary question from Labour MP Jim Cunningham.

They showed that the MoJ spent £994,000 on the visit. But HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire made 148 call-outs, with a total cost of £182,180.50 - £1,230.95 a time.

In the same period of time, HMP Manchester called them out 635 times, costing £50,444.73, which equates to £79.44 per visit. 

A TaxPayers' Alliance spokesman said: 'Everyone deserves access to justice, but costs can't spiral out of control.

'It doesn't make sense that some prisons are costing nearly £200,000 for fewer interpreters than one spending £50,000.'

Population: Roughly one in eight prisoners is foreign - with Polish, Irish and Jamaican inmates most common

Costs for translators in court are also soaring. It was revealed in May that the bill for court interpreters doubled in a single year to more than £15million.

The leap in costs came after the Ministry of Justice outsourced the work to an external firm - with 'shambolic' consequences.

A committee of MPs was told that in one case a murder trial had to be halted when a translator revealed he was in fact an unqualified stand-in for his wife.

Some courts have also been reduced to relying on Google's online translation services to administer justice.
