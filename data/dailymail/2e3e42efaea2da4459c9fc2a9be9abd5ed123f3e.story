This colourful canopy over the baking hot streets of Agueda in Portugal will not only keep you dry but will certainly put many other art exhibitions in the shade.

The sea of umbrellas brings a shower of colour over the town's narrow lanes and creates a beautiful scene - while also protecting passers-by from the baking sun.

While they appear to be floating magically in mid-air, the umbrellas are actually held up by string.

In place from July to September, the project has been developed by Umbrella Sky Project of the firm Sextafeira Produgues, who are dedicated to creating various urban installations using low-cost concepts.

The bright idea not only attracts attention but also beautifies everyday life, primarily through the use of colour.

The invasion of the floating sea of all the colours of the rainbow promotes trade, commerce, and the region itself without spending too much money, designers say.

A spokesperson from the Umbrella Sky Project said: 'It's really worth seeing the amazing scenery up close'

People now make the journey to Aguida from all over the world to see the art installation

Returning to the town for the second year, images from previous years have travelled the world and many now visit the Portuguese region to see Agueda's colourful umbrella sky.

A spokesperson from the Umbrella Sky Project said: 'It's really worth seeing the amazing scenery up close.

'The exhibition transforms reality in magic, catapulting us into a unique adventure of sensations that completes a visit to the festivals that take place around this time of year.'
