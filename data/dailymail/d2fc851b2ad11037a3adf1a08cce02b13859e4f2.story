The bitter fall-out from the £5billion battle for Premier League rights went public on Friday when Sky unleashed their director of corporate affairs to attack BT Sport and defend Sky’s huge outlay.

Graham McWilliam, who had previously called BT a ‘£22bn gorilla in puppy’s clothing’ for blacklisting Sky adverts, used his Twitter account to make seven points about the auction.

McWilliam, who has fewer than 500 Twitter followers despite his prominence at Sky, wrote: ‘Twice BT tried to muscle in and take PL rights from us. Twice Sky won max no of games. Blind auctions not for the faint-hearted. 

‘Only one company achieved all its objectives in auction. Post-rationalisation by the runners-up can’t change that.

‘Sky went in hard to get the result. Yes, paid big. That’s what it takes. We can and will absorb it. 

'Comparison of price paid ignores huge value gap. New deal gives Sky Sports even better match selections.’

BT Sport made a tame response saying: ‘We are very pleased with the outcome and the price we paid. 

'BT Sport has an exciting line-up for football fans, including Premier League, FA Cup and the Champions and Europa Leagues.’

FA Chairman Greg Dyke has ordered every department of English football’s ruling body to find ways of cutting costs by 15 per cent. This will allow the FA to spend an extra £30million a year on grassroots pitches and coaches — identified by Dyke’s England Commission as a top priority.

The biggest surprise of Phil Beard’s resignation as QPR chief executive was that he lasted three-and-a-half years in the role. Beard, a successful marketing executive who made money working with Sir Keith Mills on the Air Miles initiative, has always seemed unsuited to a football CEO role.

And Beard might have walked out of Loftus Road last summer when owner Tony Fernandes over-ruled his opposition to signing Rio Ferdinand , who has proved an expensive transfer mistake.

Qatar's beIN Sport, the richest TV network in the world, played no part in the Premier League auction. But their next move is mooted to be setting up a horse racing channel that may also include sponsoring English racing, which already benefits greatly from Qatar financial support.

RFU’s database gold

The RFU, whose rampant commercial overdrive is evident all around Twickenham, will be rubbing their hands at gaining access to the huge online database built up by England Rugby 2015 to sell two million World Cup tickets.

The names, email addresses and family details of so many rugby supporters will be direct-selling gold dust to the RFU, who previously interacted mostly with club secretaries rather than an enormous fan base.

Sky Sports are not exactly short of cricket pundits. Yet the money-no-object network are expected to add former Australian captain Ricky Ponting to their Ashes team in the summer despite Sky already having more than enough Aussie cheerleading from loudmouth Shane Warne. And none of Sky’s Test regulars are due to make way for Ponting.

The FA, who have sat on their hands over a number of serious discrimination issues this season, have been shown up by Essex FA. The county body are investigating disciplinary director Mick Elliott over his use of racist language during an appeal hearing with West Ham Ladies when he talked about ‘the n***** in the woodpile’.

Elliott said: ‘I used a phrase that means something to my age group, which I understand now causes huge offence — which is why I have resigned.’

The FA’s Club England administration of the national team looked to have been kicked into the long grass with the departure of its managing director Adrian Bevington. But it was a Club England pairing of chairman Greg Dyke and technical director Dan Ashworth who ruled that West Brom’s Saido Berahino should receive a written reprimand about a drink-driving conviction.
