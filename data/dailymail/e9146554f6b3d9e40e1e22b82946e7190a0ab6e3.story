An Oregon woman who pled guilty to driving under the influence with a hamster on her lap has completed a diversion program.

Nicole Elizabeth Huey, 29, was stopped with the furry animal on her lap by Beaverton police officers shortly after 12:30am on October 16, 2012, The Oregonian reports.

Huey reportedly told officers she was going to a local store. When she got out of the car, Huey left the hamster on the dashboard. Huey was arrested and taken to Washington County Jail.

Nicole Elizabeth Huey, seen in this mugshot, reportedly told cops they 'should just kill' her hamster when she was arrested for DUI in October 2012

An earlier report by the paper says that Huey told officers she didn't have anyone who could claim the animal -- and that they 'should just kill it.'

However, three police officers reportedly chased the hamster before one trapped it. The hamster was not harmed during the incident.

'It took three officers to capture the furry little passenger,' Mike Rowe, a Beaverton police spokesman, wrote on department's Facebook page at the time. 'It appeared that the hamster wanted to stay in the vehicle and it put up a good fight trying to avoid capture.'

Three cops reportedly tried to catch the hamster at the time of Huey's 2012 DUI arrest -- and it was temporarily placed in 'protective custody' at a clinic

Police then placed the animal in 'protective custody' at the Emergency Veterinary Clinic of Tualatin. Huey received contact information for the clinic and claimed the pet later that day.

Huey later pled guilty to one count of DUI and entered a one-year diversion program on November 7, 2012, the paper says. She paid the state program fee as well as other assessments, it says, costing $500.

The judge signed an order dismissing the conviction on December 10, 2013, court records reportedly show.
