The price of single train tickets could be halved, it has emerged - although the price of a return could rise in order to pay for it.

The Department for Transport has been in contact with the Treasury and train operators to discuss the possibility to slash the price of a single fare.

But the bill looks set to be paid for by taxpayers' expense and mean return ticket 
costs might be pushed up.

Could rail fares be slashed? The price of a single ticket could be halved but return tickets pushed up to pay for it

At the moment single fares match the price of return journeys.

Train companies could be given millions of pounds to organise the change as it would alter their operating licences.

Currently, the Treasury is considering discussing paying a significant amount for a change in fares - but where this money would be found is unclear, and could mean the scrapping of other services to raise the cash, The Times said.

Pilot schemes may begin over the next few months.

Last week it emerged that train fares could rise by more than nine per cent next year for some train journeys.

It follows an average rise of 4.2 per cent on rail network in 2013 and increases twice that size on some popular routes.

The talks about single train fares come as part of a review into Britain's rail prices.

But how the commuting public will feel about the potential drop in singles but rise in returns remains to be seen.

The Treasury is in talks wit the Department for Transport and train companies about the potential change

Passenger satisfaction with Britain’s crowded, late-running and over-priced railway network has plummeted to the lowest level in six years, a damning survey by official watchdogs revealed in June.

One in eight passengers said they were unhappy with their unreliable rail services at a time of inflation-busting fare rises and bumper bonuses for rail bosses.

Only four out of ten - 42 per cent - believe train companies give value for money while just 38 per cent are satisfied with their ability to deal with delays.

The report by consumer watchdog Passenger Focus said rail companies are ‘failing to deliver on their basic promises’ to deliver a reliable time-table and that train travellers deserved a better deal.

It comes after it was revealed last month that five rail bosses are set to receive £11million over three years in an extraordinary deal that critics condemned as rewarding failure.

The top executives at Network Rail could share bonuses of £5million on top of their six-figure salaries, despite years of dismal performance and inflation-busting fare rises.

The taxpayer-funded firm is currently facing a £75million fine for missing its punctuality targets for long distance services.

Network Rail, a not-for-profit company, has also been dogged by constant complaints over crowded trains and fare rises.

Its five bosses were already earning salaries of between £348,000 and £577,000 a year, with annual bonuses worth up to 60 per cent of their basic income.

But in July a new 'long-term incentive' payment was agreed. This additional bonus will be paid at the end of three years and is worth a maximum of a full year’s salary, depending on performance.

The new element was rubber-stamped at the company's annual general meeting in Cardiff.

Santander has made the most of a gap in the market following rail hikes with a cashback credit card that enables cardholders to get 3 per cent off the cost of future trains back.

What do you get?

Money back: Santander is offering cashback on rail fares

Santander’s 123 Credit Card allows for money
to be claimed for train tickets bought at stations or online with any 
rail company, as well as for season tickets and London Underground 
tickets.

The small print

There are loopholes. There is a £300-a-month limit on which you can claim back money and those travelling in Northern Ireland are barred from claiming back on tickets booked online with NI Railways.

Purchases
not eligible for cashback include TfL travelcards, passes and Oyster 
Card top ups made at newsagents, garages and off-licences. Eurotunnel Le
Shuttle and train tickets bought through travel agents or tour 
operators are also excluded from the deal.

There
is a £24 annual fee which is waived for the first year using a fairly 
complicated refund system. To qualify for this refund you must open or 
hold a 123 Current Account and set up a direct debit from the 123 
Current Account to pay your 123 Credit Card within 30 days.

The
annual fee charged for the first year will then be refunded to your 123
Credit Card account within 21 days from the later of either activating 
your card and/or setting up the direct debit from your 123 Current 
Account.

Cardholders will have to think carefully as to whether, on balance, the high annual fee cancels out savings made from cashback.

There is also a high APR of 22.8 per cent - so make sure you pay off your full balance every month to avoid interest.

Additional benefits

Cardholders also benefit from a lucrative cashback scheme on a range of household bills.

This
includes 1 per cent cashback on all major supermarkets, 2 per cent at 
all major department stores including Debenhams, John Lewis, and Harvey 
Nichols, as well as 3 per cent on spends at all major petrol stations.

Santander is also offering a 30 per cent discount deal on home insurance with this card. Terms and conditions apply - click here to read more.
