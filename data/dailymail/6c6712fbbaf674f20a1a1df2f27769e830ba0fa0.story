Wales may be known for daffodils and dragons, but one man looks set to change that after becoming a global leader in the manufacturing of digeridoos.

Ray Brook, 62, lives on Anglesey, but his musical instruments have been sold internationally with orders even coming in from 21,000 miles away in Australia where they were invented.

He now claims he is the world's most prolific manufacturer having single-handedly making more than 25,000 4ft digeridoos since first crafting one in the 1970s while living in New York.

He also makes flutes from bamboo at his home workshop in Rhosneigr, Anglesey, and both instruments are selling across the globe, including down under.

Mr Brook makes the instruments out of bamboo and uses a blow torch to decorate them. In the 1990s he was making up to 2,000 didgeridoos every year and still produces up to 1,000 every 12 months.

Traditional didgeridoos from the northern parts of Australia are primarily made from the hollow branches of eucalyptus trees.

But Mr Brook, a father-of-four, who lives in Rhosneigr in North Wales, says didgeridoos made out of bamboo are easier to play and produce a better sound.

He said: 'I feel like the man who has sold sand to the Arabs and coals to Newcastle. usually sell them at craft fairs but sales of my stuff online have spread and to people from every corner of the world - including Australia who particularly like my flutes.

Top quality: Ray Brook sells his instruments, which he makes in his workshop in Anglesey, North Wales, to countries all over the world - including Australia where they were first invented 1,500 years ago

'It's incredible when you think I live in Wales. I don't know of anyone else making didgeridoos around here.'

Born in the UK but raised in Canada, Mr Brooks played recorder, flute, saxophone and oboe as a child and started teaching himself to make wooden flutes as a teenager.

'I enjoyed making things and had some bamboo lying around, so a friend and I started making flutes by cutting up wood and using a hot screwdriver to make the holes.'

Mr Brook first realised he could make a business of selling his creations after he moved to the United States.

The father-of-four started making didgeridoos in the 70s as a hobby and it progressed from there into a business.

Business: Ray Brook, pictured in his workshop with his didgeridoos and walking stick flutes, makes his instruments in batches of 30 and sell them for up to £45 each

Pieces of art: Ray Brook is considered to be the most prolific solo manufacturers of the instrument

He added: 'I enjoyed making things 
and had some bamboo lying around, so a friend and I started making 
flutes by cutting up wood and using a hot screwdriver to make the holes.

'I was living in New York and realised that you could sell anything if it was made to a good standard.

'So
I looked up some bamboo suppliers in the Yellow Pages and sold my 
flutes in Central Park. They sold well despite not being in tune.

'I moved back to the UK and was selling them at craft fairs and festivals. They were very successful. Now I do shows around the country and they sell all around the world.

'Over the years I have sold thousands and thousands of didgeridoos and I've been making them for 24 years. There is probably not anyone in the world who has made more than me.'

He sells the instruments for up to £45 each and makes them in batches of 30.

Successful: Ray Brook started making the didgeridoos as a hobby before he realised he could turn his passion into a business

Carving out a reputation: Ray Brook, who lives in Rhosneigr on the Island of Anglesey in North Wales, has been making instruments including flutes and didgeridoos for over 30 years

Mr Brook said: 'As soon as I started 
making them it took over my life. I had to learn how to make them in 
tune, which took about three years. The thing about bamboo is that no 
two pieces are the same, so you have to get to know the material to get 
the tuning right.

'I 
make my didgeridoos with bamboo, which is a lovely material; it's very 
resonant and easier to play than a hardwood didgeridoo, which would be 
made out of eucalyptus in Australia.'

Versatile: Talented musician Ray Brook claims the didgeridoo is one of the easiest instruments to play

He has visited the instrument's native land and says his versions measure up to the originals.

'I have been to Australia and it's nice to know that mine compare to the indigenous didgeridoos.

'It's one of the easiest instruments to play. All you have to do is blow a raspberry down a tube. It sounds a bit rough at first but it doesn't take long to get better.

'It's the circular breathing which takes time and allows you to go without stopping.

'In the 1990s, it was a really big thing so a lot of people got on the bandwagon. People used to take them to festivals, but that fizzled out.

'I don't sell the volume that I used to, but I now sell them at craft fairs and to people from every corner of the world on my website.

'I used to say every home should have a didgeridoo. Now I say that every home should have three!'

The didgeridoo was developed by Indigenous Australians of northern Australia around 1,500 years ago and still in widespread use today both in Australia and around the world.

It is sometimes described as a natural wooden trumpet or 'drone pipe'. Musicologists classify it as a brass aerophone.

Archaeological studies of rock art in Northern Australia suggest that the people of the Kakadu region of the Northern Territory have been using the didgeridoo for less than 1,000 years, based on the dating of paintings on cave walls.
