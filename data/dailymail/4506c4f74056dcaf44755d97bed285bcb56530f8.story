Dubai is opening a new theme park with a difference - it will be based entirely underwater.

The holiday hotspot wants to capitalise on the popularity of scuba-diving and snorkeling by opening the world’s largest underwater tourism site which will be called Pearl Of Dubai.

The five acre site, located in the shallow waters off The World Islands development, has been designed to look like an ancient lost city, by teams who were also involved in the Hollywood blockbusters Avatar and Pirates Of The Caribbean.

Guests of all ages will be able to explore the stunning scenes underneath the sea by scuba-diving or just admire from the surface by snorkeling.

Los Angeles-based underwater tourism design company Reef Worlds announced the revolutionary plans in a media statement today.

It’s hoped the ambitious new project will help Dubai attract new guests from the global £1.8 billion ($3 billion) dive and snorkel market.

Dave Taylor, director of development for Reef Worlds, said: ‘The UAE has a unique tourism problem that we address.

‘When one considers Dubai and the region, scuba diving and underwater exploration is not on the Top Ten list, and yet it is almost everywhere else in the world.’

Reef Worlds also has plans to work in other places, including the Philippines, where tourism and regional habitat could use an immediate boost.

Taylor continued: ‘The Reef Worlds brand is all about sustainability and the creation of new habitat while at the same time adding instant tourism revenue and excitement to waterfront resorts.

‘We will work with carefully selected resort partners on unique underwater habitat projects that directly support our clients’ sustainability and revenue goals.’

An opening date has yet to be announced.
