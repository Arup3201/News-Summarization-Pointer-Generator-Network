A police captain in New Jersey has been arrested and charged with trying to run down a Newark city councilman with her car in what police are calling a domestic violence incident. 

Monique Smith, 43, an officer in nearby Irvington, rammed Newark City Councilman John Sharpe James with her car on Tuesday morning after an argument outside his house, according to Newark police.

The attack came just hours after Smith was promoted to police captain at a ceremony at Irvington City Hall on Monday night.

Police have not said what promoted the attack or what Smith's relationship with the councilman is - though investigators are calling it an act of domestic violence. 

Smith is charged with stalking, criminal mischief, harassment, possession of a weapon, possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose and aggravated assault.

Police say that Smith arrived at James' house at 11am and confronted him outside. James got into his car and drove to the home of his father - former longtime Newark Mayor Sharpe James. 

During on the drive there, Smith chased him in her persona vehicle and allegedly rammed James' car multiple times. 

When James and Smith arrived at his father's house, Mayor James was able to intervene and Smith left. 

She was arrested later at a different location. 

Irvington Mayor Tony Vauss told the Newark Star-Ledger that Smith has been suspended without pay.

However, he defended the decision to promote her. 

'She’s been a fine officer for many years in the Irvington Police Department,' he said.
