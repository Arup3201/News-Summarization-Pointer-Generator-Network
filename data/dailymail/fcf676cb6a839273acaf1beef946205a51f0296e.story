Outspoken: Rail minister Simon Burns said opponents of NS2 would come to realise it was in the national interest

Opponents of the controversial £42billion high speed rail line have been likened by a minister to anti-progress campaigners who did not want motorways built in the 1950s and 1960s.

Transport minister Simon Burns risked escalating the row over the HS2 project, which the government claims will cut travel times from London to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds.

The intervention came as the Court of Appeal rejected the latest legal challenge to the plan from 15 councils and campaign groups.

The project ran into trouble when the government admitted recently that the bill had soared by £10billion to £42.6billion.

However Lord Mitchell is just the latest senior Labour figure to signal a collapse in support for the project.

Former Labour Cabinet minister Lord Mandelson, ex-chancellor and former transport secretary Alistair Darling, and ITV chairman and former Tory MP Archie Norman have all cast doubt on the scheme in recent weeks.

But yesterday David Cameron reiterated HS2's importance, saying it was essential if Britain was to be a winner in the global race.

Today judges at the Court of Appeal dismissed all grounds of challenge but gave the go-ahead for a final appeal to the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land.

Opponents had asked the appeal judges to order further assessment of the scheme as a whole.

High Speed Rail minister Simon Burns said: ‘By dismissing all seven grounds of appeal and declining to refer the case to Europe, this is the second time in four months a court has rejected attempts to derail HS2.

"Parliament is the right place to debate the merits of HS2, not the law courts, and we will introduce the hybrid bill for Phase One before the year is out.

‘I urge opponents not to waste any more taxpayers' money on expensive litigation and instead work with us on making HS2 the very best it can be.’

But in a provocative move, he claimed those against the project now would eventually see the error of their ways.

He told Sky News: ‘There [is] going to be some damage to the environment because that’s inevitable, but we have to be careful because people were against High Speed Rail 1 in Kent and now they have come to appreciate the benefits it brings to the local community and to improving travel.

‘They were against motorways being built in the late 1950s, early ‘60s. And what we should be doing is working together to minimise and solve the problems while we go ahead with the scheme that is clearly in the national interest.

‘We continue to move forward with the crucial business of getting the scheme ready for construction in 2017 and delivering enormous benefits for the country.’

Progress: Opponents of high speed rail were likened to those people who did not support the building of motorways, like the M1 which opened in 1959

The objectors say the project will cause an unacceptable level of environmental damage, loss of homes and disruption to many communities - without the public having had a fair hearing and a chance to suggest reasonable, cheaper alternatives.

Halt: Labour's Lord Mandelson now says his party was wrong to offer fulsome backing to the high speed rail project linking London and the north

David Elvin QC, appearing for HS2 Action Alliance (HS2AA), told the appeal court the project had already blighted a swathe of properties along the route.

He argued that it had been given the go-ahead in breach of EU rules requiring a strategic environmental assessment (SEA).

It was being seen as the country's largest infrastructure project for a generation and the largest single rail project since the 19th century.

But the decision in principle to proceed, taken by the Transport Secretary in January last year, breached a European Directive requiring an SEA.

He asked three judges - Lord Dyson, the Master of the Rolls, Lord Justice Richards and Lord Justice Sullivan - to overturn a High Court ruling in March.

With the estimated cost of the line rising to £42.6billion, Lord Mandelson said earlier this that those who previously backed the plan ‘should not offer it an open cheque and should, instead, insist on keeping their options open.’

Labour’s plans were based on an estimated cost of £30billion and the central assumption that construction would spread growth across the country. This was ‘neither quantified nor proved’, said the peer.

‘I once supported High Speed 2. There are no simple options when it comes to transport – but I now fear HS2 could be an expensive mistake,’ he wrote in a national newspaper.
