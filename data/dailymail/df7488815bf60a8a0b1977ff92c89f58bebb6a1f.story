An American teenager charged over the death of Australian baseballer Chris Lane has been handed a life sentence after he pleaded guilty to the random drive-by killing in 2013.

Michael Jones, who was charged along with two other US teenagers, will not be eligible for parole until he is 56-years-old.

Jones, who was the driver of the car from which a bullet was fired at Lane, begged for forgiveness as he was sentenced a minimum of 38 years in prison, the ABC reports.

Lane, 22, from Melbourne, was shot in the back on August 16, 2013, in what police said was a random killing as he ran along a road in Duncan, southern Oklahoma, where he was on a sporting scholarship.

The two other teens, charged with first-degree murder and accessory in the first, will face court next month. They were 17 and 16 at the time of the baseballer’s death. 

In December 2013, in the first courageous interview since her son’s death, Lane’s mother Donna Lane told the Daily Mail she doesn’t care what happens to the teens charged with killing her son.

'It's not going to bring my Chris back,' she said. 

Ms Lane told how she had shed tears every day for her only son, admitting that even though he had been living in the US for the past four years her life in Melbourne has been empty knowing he's never coming back for a visit. 

At her home in the suburb of Pascoe Vale, lying between Melbourne city centre and the airport, Donna opened a photograph album put together as a special memorial for her by his friends in the US.

Right there on the first page was a shot that makes her so proud - Chris in his baseball strip crouching, waiting for a catch.

'He was always good with the ball almost as soon as he could walk,' she said, turning the pages, smiling at one of him poking his tongue out at the camera.

'I'm not at all surprised he ended up as such a talented player.

'I know that his friends see him as a brilliant catcher and while he might be a super-hero to them he's still my son and what strikes me all the time is that even though he's so special I can't have him back.

'People ask me all the time what I think about the three who have been arrested in connection with his murder. But do you know what - I don't care.

'I don't care if they go to prison for life or if they walk free again. Whatever happens to them isn't going to bring Chris back. I'm not interested in what happens to them.

'What's the point of looking for some kind of retribution? How is it going to change things for me and my family?

'My friends tell me that if those three do walk free they might do it again, you know, hurt somebody else, but whatever happens over there now still doesn't affect me in any way whatsoever.

'What's done is done and I can't turn the clock back,' the devastated mother added. 

Chris was on a scholarship at the East Central University as a team catcher when he was killed.
