You would think that bodysurfers had enough to worry about when riding a wave, but one talented photographer has decided to combine his hobby with his profession to capture some impressive images in the surf.

American Kenji Croman, 36, developed a passion for surfing while he was growing up in Hawaii.

He was inspired to take the shots after he struggled to explain to his family and friends about the incredible waves he witnessed while boarding out in the ocean.

Kenji decided to let his camera do the talking instead, purchasing special underwater equipment that allowed him to capture spectacular images from inside the barrel of a rolling wave.

He explained: ‘It's hard to describe to people who have never surfed or have never been inside a wave how beautiful it can be especially when it's the right lighting, it's such an incredible experience.

‘Since I have a background in photography and have so much experience in big waves, it's a perfect combination for becoming a wave photographer.'

The photographs were shot off the North Shore of Oahu and near several beaches on the South Shores of Oahu, Hawaii.

‘My photography is my art, it's how I communicate to the world,' Kenji explained. 'Watching a beautiful sunrise while getting to shoot in the waves is meditating for me. It's my sanctuary.

‘It took me months to get a good shot when I first started. Back then there was no GoPro camera so it was much more difficult to carry a bulky camera and housing and time it right to get a good shot. 

'I still remember my first decent photo, I was so stoked to finally get a clear photo from inside the barrel looking out.’ 

In a spin: Some of the clever shots even manage to capture some of Kenji's fellow surfers and swimmers

Croman has travelled all over the world taking photographs and now teaches an underwater photography course at the University of Hawaii. He also offers private surf photography lessons and regularly posts images on his website,gokenji.com. 

He says: ‘I am constantly driven to get that better shot. It isn't just about taking pictures for me anymore; it is being creative and trying to capture the beauty in nature in an artistic way.’
