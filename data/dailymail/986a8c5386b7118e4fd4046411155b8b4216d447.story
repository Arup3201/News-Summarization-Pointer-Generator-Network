A woman was shamed into losing weight after being horrified by a picture of herself in her bikini.

But Becky Latham is back in a skimpy two-piece for the first time in 18 months after shedding three stone, and she's so proud of her size-eight figure she's even taken part in a bikini contest.

Becky, who lives in Birmingham, said: 'I was 11 stone when I saw the picture of me in a bikini and I was disgusted with myself.

'And I didn't have the confidence to wear one again until now but I'm in the best shape of my life and I'm proud to show my figure off.'

New woman: Becky Latham, 32, shows off her new body in the Bikini Diva category of Miss Galaxy Universe after losing three stone

Before and after: She was originally a size 14 
but was so horrified by this bikini photos that she embarked on a grueling 
fitness programme and worked out six times a week 

Last month, 32-year-old Becky took to the stage in front of hundreds of people to compete in the Bikini Diva category of beauty and fitness competition Miss Galaxy Universe.

She said: 'Putting on the bikini really did make me feel like a million dollars for the first time in my life and I loved every single second on stage.

'It was emotional and I think I cried when I had finished but I was so pleased I had done it.

'The blood, sweat and tears of the last 18 months had really paid off.'

New confidence: Becky was shamed into losing weight after being horrified by a picture of herself in her bikini but now she is back in a skimpy two-piece for the first time in 18 months

Becky says she had always been a slender size eight through her teens and twenties but noticed the weight creep after moving to Catral, Spain with her husband Jason, 41, in 2008.

At her heaviest, Becky weighed 11 stone and was wearing size 14 clothes.

She said: 'I tried to be careful about what I ate but the weight crept up. I'd restrict myself to a tin of tomato soup or beans on toast in the day but at night I would sink endless glasses of wine and munch on crisps and chocolate.

'I hated my body more than anything and I hate the way it made me feel. I ended up being so negative despite living in our Spanish paradise.

Working out: For the next four months Becky spent five to six days each week in the gym at spin and circuit classes and then teamed up with husband Jay to train with weights

'My turnaround really came in 2011 when I was looking at photographs taken from the summer. I decided enough was enough and I had to do something.'

For the next four months Becky spent five to six days each week in the gym at spin and circuit classes and then teamed up with husband Jay to train with weights.

And she continued after they moved back to the UK in November last year.

She said: 'The weights area was surrounded by mirrors and I couldn't bear to look at myself but Jason was so supportive, he really helped me.

'With weight training I was able to burn more calories and within three months I'd lost a stone, the rest fell off really quickly.

Support system: Becky says her husband Jason, 41, was so supportive and really helped her after she became too insecure to even look in the mirror

'I began reading up on female weight training and changed my diet. Before then I was starving myself but I began eating more protein and carbs and fats.

'I even went up to six meals a day and made sure I had lots of vegetables and natural food - never any packets or ready meals.

'It gave me so much more energy and I really felt alive, refreshed and strong.'

Today eight and a half stone Becky pumps iron four days a week and is able to lift 60 kilos - more than she weighs.

And she's even joined UK Bodybuilding and Fitness Federation, which holds bodybuilding contests.

She said: 'I now feel in better shape than I was when I was a teenager.

'And
I can hopefully inspire others who are feeling low about themselves by 
showing them if you really want something it is achievable.'

How she was: Becky, pictured here in 2011 and 2010, used to eat ready meals and packaged food but now she feels much healthier on a diet of fresh fruit and vegetables

Lean: Becky has even joined UK Bodybuilding and Fitness Federation, which holds bodybuilding contests
