Whether placenta facials, vajazzling or fish pedicures, recent years have seen bizarre beauty treatments become the norm.

But, as NY Magazine has revealed, toe-curling beauty treatments aren't as modern as most of us think.

From Elizabeth I's toxic lead make-up to poisonous eye drops made from deadly nightshade, historic beauty treatments were just as bizarre as their modern equivalents.

But what's in the compact? Berthe Morisot's 1877 Young Woman Powdering Her Face

Most were also considerably more gruesome, among them a painful-sounding method for lengthening the lashes championed in an 1899 edition of The Dundee Courier.

Under the headline Irresistible Eyes May Be Had By Transplanting The Hair, the piece explains how longer eyelashes can be achieved by having hair from the head sewn into the eyelids.

The article concludes: 'Eyebrows are doctored in the same way, but there is not so much pain associated with the process as there is in transplanting eyelashes.'

If that's not enough to leave you feeling ready to go bare-faced, a particularly dangerous method of removing excess hair might do the trick.

Within a year of Wilhelm Roentgen's discovery of the X-ray in 1895, doctors and dermatologists were using them to treat everything from excess hair to acne.

But while the treatment did indeed remove hair, getting rid of it required as much as 20 hours under the X-ray, which led to everything from burns to cancer.

Not clever: X-rays were used as a treatment for excess body hair while mercury was thought to cure spots

Although the side effects of prolonged exposure to X-rays were noted in a 1909 report, it wasn't until 1920 that the consequences were fully understood.

And X-rays weren't the only radioactive beauty treat embraced by women in the late Victorian period and early 20th century.

Radium itself was used as an ingredient in expensive skincare, with one 1915 ad, for a company called Radior's range of rouge, night cream and skin soap, reading:

'An ever-flowing Fountain of Youth and Beauty has at last been found in the Energy Rays of Radium.

'When scientists discovered Radium they hardly dreamed they had unearthed a revolutionary "Beauty Secret."

'They know it now. Radium Rays vitalize and energize all living tissue.'

But while it took time for the deadly results of radium and X-rays to be revealed, other popular ingredients for beauty potions took effect more quickly.

Poison: Like arsenic and mercury, Belladonna leaves could be deadly but were once used in eye drops

Particularly dangerous was arsenic, a fast acting poison used by Victorian women to achieve pale, perfect skin.

Unfortunately for those who used it, it achieved the effect by killing off red blood cells and also made users go bald.

Although those who used readymade potions such as Dr MacKenzie’s Improved Harmless Arsenic Complexion Wafers weren't immune, those who attempted to make their own by soaking the arsenic off fly paper tended to feel the ill-effects more quickly.

Unlike arsenic, there was no DIY way to create face cream based on mercury, although that didn't stop hundreds of thousands of women from being poisoned by lotions made from it.

Before safer cures for spots were invented, the dangerous substance was used to cure acne - and syphillis - despite the fact that mercury is easily absorbed through the skin and causes birth defects, kidney and liver problems, fatigue, irritability, tremors and depression.

And that wasn't all. Hair pomade made from rodent-attracting lard and make-up that contained lead remained big business until well into the 20th century.

So will future generations remember modern treatments as bizarre and deadly? With traces of mercury and lead still found in some products, and poisonous formaldehyde used in keratin blow-drys, it seems likely.

An ordinary fine needle is threaded with a long hair, generally taken from the head of the person to be operated upon. The lower border of the eyelid is then thoroughly cleaned, and in order that the process may be as painless as possible rubbed with a solution of cocaine. The operator then by a few skilful touches runs his needle through the extreme edges of the eyelid between the epidermis and the lower border of the cartilage of the tragus. The needle passes in and out along the edge of the lid leaving its hair thread in loops of carefully graduated length.When this has been done another length of hair is sewed through the lid until finally there are a dozen or more loops projecting. By this time the effect of the cocaine has been lost, and the operator is obliged to desist, and put off further “sewing of hair” for another sitting.The next step in the process is cutting off and trimming the ends of the loops, and the result is a fine, thick, long set of eyelashes. It is the finishing touch, that is to come, that makes them look like nature’s own. When they are at first cut they stick out in the most singular fashion, giving the person operated upon the most uncanny look. The operator’s next step is to take curling tongs, made of silver, and no larger than knitting needles, and to give them the curve which is essential to perfect beauty. Then the eyes are carefully bandaged, and kept so until the following day.
