A Texas cab driver is still at large after allegedly murdering his two teen daughters six years ago in an 'honor killing'.

Yaser Abdel Said, a 57-year-old Egyptian immigrant, is wanted by the FBI in connection to the shooting deaths of his daughters Amina, 18, and Sarah, 17.

The bodies of the two girls were found on January 1, 2008 after they were threatened by their father to stop dating their non-Muslim boyfriends.

According to UN estimates, about 5,000 women die each year in honor killings which are carried out against someone who has brought 'shame' on the family.

Now a new documentary hopes to re-ignite the hunt for Said, who may be working as a cab driver in New York.

The documentary, titled The Price of Honor, took directors Neena Nejad and Xoel Pamos three years to complete, and promises to reveal new details on the case - including details from Amina's private journals and the possible whereabouts of her father.

'Amina left behind a treasure trove of secrets critical to convicting the father of her murder that no one had explored until we started investigating,' Pamos said in a press release.

'In her own words, through letters, emails and diary entries, she answered almost every question we had about this disturbing case.'

Days before their death, the girls and their mother, Patricia Said, left their father over threats of physical violence, stemming from their dates with non-Muslim boys.

But Patricia eventually returned home and coaxed the girls to come back as well.

Then, on January 1, 2008, Said took his daughters out for a drive to get something to eat.

But instead of going to a restaurant, Said shot the girls dead.

In the moments before her death, Sarah had enough time to call 911 and frantically ask for help.

'My Dad shot me and my sister, I'm dying,' Sarah says in the heartbreaking recording.

Said then fled with his Egyptian passport and $9,000 cash.

A private investigator believes Said may be living and working as a cab driver in New York City

While the FBI believes he may have left the country and returned to Egypt, a private investigator hired by the girl's aunt believes he is still in hiding in the U.S.

Said may have gone to New York City, where he has family nearby, and could be illegally working as a cab driver.

While all yellow cab drivers must pass a background test, the president of the city's Foundation of Taxi Drivers told Fox News that there are ways to get around this.

'There are 10,000 illegal drivers in New York City,' Mateo told FoxNews.com. 'It’s as easy as getting in your car and driving to the airport or picking up illegal street hails.'

There is currently a $20,000 reward for Said's capture.

He is described as 6-foot-2, 180 pounds with black hair and brown eyes. He is known to wear dark sunglasses inside and outside, and frequents diners including Denny's and IHOP.

The Price of Honor premieres in September.
