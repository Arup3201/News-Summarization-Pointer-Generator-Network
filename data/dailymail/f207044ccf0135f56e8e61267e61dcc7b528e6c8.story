Anne Mcintosh has been deselected from her safe seat

A senior Tory woman MP became the 
first to be axed by the party for almost a decade last night after a 
bitter deselection battle.

Anne
 McIntosh, a former shadow minister who now chairs an influential 
Commons committee, was dumped after a secret ballot of members of her 
local party.

She is the fifth of the 49 Conservative women MPs who will not be standing for the party in 2015.

In
 an indication of the turmoil that has engulfed the Conservatives in 
Thirsk and Malton, Miss McIntosh – who has been an MP since 1997 and 
chairs the environment, food and rural affairs committee – claimed she 
had been ousted by a ‘small cabal’.

One
 fellow Tory said Miss McIntosh, who used her Twitter account to issue 
Biblical quotes apparently aimed at her detractors, was ‘a few peas 
short of a casserole’.

Another Conservative source said: ‘Anne has not helped herself. She is a menace.’

Earlier this week it was alleged that local Tory party officials conducted a dirty tricks campaign to oust Miss McIntosh.

A
 significant number of new members were co-opted on to the association’s
 executive committee before a crucial vote last January to decide on the
 MP’s future, it has been claimed.

The
 alleged irregularity has been called the Tory party’s ‘Falkirk moment’ –
 a comparison to allegations of vote rigging over the selection of a 
candidate in the Scottish constituency.

Among
 the names touted as potential replacements is Edward Legard, a 
barrister and local councillor – and an old Etonian school friend of 
David Cameron. Pollster Andrew Cooper, a Tory Party adviser and a 
leading moderniser, expressed despair at the loss of another woman, 
writing on Twitter: ‘Five down, 44 to go.’

Labour
 frontbencher Jon Ashworth said it was a further blow to the Tories 
following the departure of Louise Mensch and the announcement that Laura
 Sandys, Lorraine Fullbrook and Jessica Lee will stand down in 2015.

‘What
 on earth is the Conservative Party’s problem with women? With Anne 
McIntosh deselected, the Tories look set to lose their only female MP in
 the whole of Yorkshire and the Humber,’ he said.

‘David
 Cameron has done nothing to stand up for one of his most senior women 
MPs. His silence speaks volumes at a time when many people are asking 
why the Conservative Party is so out of touch.’

Last night’s vote is highly unusual. Only four other MPs have been sacked by membership ballot in 25 years.

Anxious wait: Miss McIntosh, pictured with fellow MP David Davies, has faced a deselection vote with the result announced on Friday

Miss
 McIntosh, immediately announced that she intends to stand as an 
independent in the seat which she held at the last election with an 
11,281 majority – a move that could split the Conservative vote in one 
of its few safe northern strongholds.

‘I
 do not intend to be thrown aside by a small cabal. It is for my 
constituents as a whole to dismiss me if they wish to do so,’ the MP 
said.

‘It is my intention to stand for Thirsk, Malton and Filey constituency at the next general election.

‘Meanwhile,
 I remain committed to the Conservative Party locally and nationally and
 shall continue with my constituency and parliamentary duties with my 
customary passion.’

Peter 
Steveny, a retired Army major and former Jockey Club stewards’ 
secretary, who chairs the local Conservative association is among those 
said to have fallen out with Miss McIntosh.

The
 constituency will now re-open its selection process, and Miss  McIntosh
 will be free to reapply for the Conservative nomination.

A
 Conservative spokesman said turnout in the secret ballot had been high,
 with 88 per cent of members taking part and Miss McIntosh being 
defeated by a ‘significant’ majority.

Tim
 Yeo, the chairman of the energy and climate change committee, is also 
facing a deselection battle with his local party and will learn his fate
 early next week.
