Sportsmail’s Graham Poll gives his assessment of Mark Clattenburg’s performance at the King Power Stadium as Manchester United were humbled by Leicester City.

Sunday's Premier League encounter took a huge turn after Rafael was penalised for an apparent foul on Jamie Vardy when Manchester United were 3-1 up.

The decision proved costly as Leicester went on to claim all three points by scoring five goals past David de Gea.

It’s hard to criticise a referee, but the elite group are told by management that they cannot defend the indefensible.

With Manchester United cruising and destined for three points, Clattenburg somehow missed what appeared to be a clear foul on Rafael by Vardy – and to compound the error then gave the softest of penalties when the Brazilian recovered and brushed the striker off the ball.

If that was an error then the second penalty certainly wasn’t, as was the easy decision of sending off Tyler Blackett for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity.
