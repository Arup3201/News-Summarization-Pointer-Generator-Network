It is becoming as much a staple of Christmas as turkey and mince pies... Jamie Oliver’s is proving the most popular celebrity cookbook again this year.

The TV chef is heading to the top of the Christmas bestseller list for the fourth year running.

Figures released by The Bookseller magazine show that Save With Jamie, which shows families how to cook ‘tasty, nutritious food on a budget’, has sold 201,959 copies since it was released at the end of August.

Paul Hollywood’s cookbook, Pies and Puds, is the fifth biggest-selling cookery book, notching up 50,459 sales since its release at the end of October.
