The State Department has now launched an investigation after one of CNN's foreign ​correspondents ​allegedly bit two medical workers​ ​during a drunken fit at the US Embassy​ in Baghdad​.

Senior international correspondent A​rwa Damon was said to be drunk and abusive to medics stationed on the grounds of the embassy.

Tracy Lamar and Charles Simons, EMTs 
working for a private contractor in Iraq, say Damon chomped into each of
 their left arms as they tried to help her.

More than she could chew: Arwa Davis, a respected journalist who covers the Middle East for CNN, allegedly bit two EMTs in a drunken rage

Top reporter: Arwa Damon speaks four languages and was recently awarded the Courage in Journalism Award by the International Women's Media Foundation

It's alleged she bit both EMTs on their forearms as they tried to treat her on July 19.

The medics were called to calm the correspondent after she became 'totally out of control.'

Gossip
 and rumor column Page Six says the State Department prepared a report 
on the incident, which was sent to CNN however Damon continued working 
for the network regardless.

She
 then penned a groveling apology to US Embassy staff about her 
'disastrous behavior,' which she claims she doesn’t fully remember.

She
 said in an e-mail: 'It’s been an extremely stressful time, I was 
exhausted, I had not had proper food all day and clearly miscalculated 
how my body would handle the alcohol consumed … Needless to say, I am 
utterly mortified and take full responsibility for my actions, which are
 inexcusable.'

She
 added, 'I am being filled in on the details of my behavior. I am beyond
 embarrassed. My actions and words were entirely out of my character, 
and I hope that everyone can at some point forgive me.'

'So
 once again, I am apologizing and extending my thanks to all that were 
involved in ensuring that I am, thankfully, in the end, taken care of 
and physically at least OK. Everyone was extremely professional and 
courteous in the face of my unjustified behavior,' she continued.

The suit claims that CNN was aware Damon had a history of drunken aggression, and was even known to be violent when sober

It's now believed a $2 million lawsuit​ has been filed against Damon and CNN in Manhattan​.

According
 to the New York Post, the papers say Damon, 36, bit EMT​​s Tracy Lamar 
and Charles Simons as they tried to help her, before threatening them 
and saying she was a 'major reporter for CNN,' but when this 
failed she became physically violent.'

She
 was biting them both pretty furiously. She has good teeth. Eventually 
they subdued her,' David Jaroslawicz, an attorney for Simons and Lamar said. 

The
 suit claims CNN hired Damon knowing she 'has a history of becoming 
intoxicated and then abusive,' and a 'penchant for violence even when 
sober.'

CNN are still denying all knowledge of the lawsuit and are refusing to comment on the case.

The
 EMTs’ lawyer, David Jaroslawicz, added, 'To get so very drunk and 
attack people who are trying to help you is somewhat disturbing, 
particularly as a reporter.'

Damon's biography on CNN states that she's an award-winning journalist whose recent focus has been on the situation in Syria.

She
 won an Emmy for Outstanding Live Coverage of a Current News Story for 
her reporting on the Arab Spring, as well as a Peabody Award.

Recently, she was given the Courage in Journalism Award by the International Women's Media Foundation.

She is from Boston but spent much of her childhood in Morocco and Turkey.
