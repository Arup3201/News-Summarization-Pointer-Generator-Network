He’s either woefully ignorant about the dangers of military-grade explosives – or he’s got nerves of steel.

Video footage has emerged of a pro-separatist soldier in Ukraine remaining totally at ease as missiles rain down just yards away.

His show of remarkable fearlessness comes during an interview about the war with government forces and the struggle to control Donetsk airport.

This is one rebel soldier's reaction to a nearby missile strike in Ukraine

His show of remarkable fearlessness comes during an interview about the war with government forces and the struggle to control Donetsk airport

At first it’s accompanied by the sound of dogs barking and birds singing, but the serenity is interrupted by the terrifying sound of missiles screaming towards targets nearby.

A handful of men watching the interview scurry for cover in a building a few yards away – but the soldier listens without moving, seemingly completely unconcerned.

‘At the moment you can hear Grad [a missile system] working at us,’ he says.

He doesn’t even flinch at the frightening sound of the missiles exploding. He just takes a few puffs on his cigarette and says ‘you’ve heard this, you saw this’.

The proximity of the strike was such that bits of shrapnel landed at the soldier’s feet.

He says: ‘Here are fragments flying at us… watch your head.’

The men who hid in the building (right) emerge and ask him if he’s looking at shrapnel from the missile strike. ‘Yes, yes. They’ve fired it just now,’ the soldier replies

With an air of staggering nonchalance he then bends down and picks up a piece.

He says: ‘Damn, it’s still hot. Little b*****d.’

The men who hid in the building emerge and ask him if he’s looking at shrapnel from the missile strike.

‘It fell just now?’ one asks.

‘Yes, yes. They’ve fired it just now,’ he replies.

The only person seemingly able to match the soldier’s bravery is the camera operator, who also stays out in the open.
