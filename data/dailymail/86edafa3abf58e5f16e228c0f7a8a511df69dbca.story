A mysterious beast that has been attacking cattle has been killed on a farm in Belarus, baffling people living nearby and the local vet with its bizarre appearance.

This freakish monstrosity, which some cynics might say looks a lot like a normal woodland animal, had been attacking cows and calves by savagely biting their feet, drawing parallels to the Chupacabra of Latin American legend.

The vet is at a loss as to what the creature is, claiming two similar creatures have been spotted in the region, but they both managed to evade their pursuers by melting into the forests like supernatural beings. Or small woodland animals, which the body closely resembles.

Is this monstrous beast, killed by a Belorussian farmhand, the legendary chupacabra or is there a more pedestrian explanation? We may never know...

The region's hunters are also at a loss. Some of them believe it is a mutant amalgam of a number of species because it resembles a hyena, has the features of a fox, a raccoon and a dog, reports English Russia.

The vet described it as a 'sensation' and vowed to burn the corpse of the killed animal. Presumably in case it comes back to life.

But an earlier discovery may be the key to unlocking this mystery. A Ukrainian farmer killed a similar animal last year and gave the body of the animal to biologists.

Speculation was rife about the creature, with some claiming that it could be a 'mutant' fox poisoned by radiation, while another theory was that it was a hybrid originating from a secret Soviet plant conducting tests on animals relating to chemical or biological weapons development.

A fox mutated by radiation? Or the by-product of a sinister Soviet experiment. No, according to Ukrainian scientists, it's a raccoon dog

The biologists, however, pointed out it was a raccoon dog, which were be bred on Soviet farms in 1939, but were released into the wild when the Second World War started.

The Chupacabra is a Latin American monster that attacks livestock, usually goats, and drinks their blood.

The name itself is derived from the Spanish 'chupar' ('to suck') and 'cabra' ('goat').

Descriptions of them vary from reptilian with spikes or quills on its back to hairless dogs with fangs and claws.

Someone in Piedmont, North Carolina, sent this picture of a mangy dog-like creature into a local TV station with the caption: 'Chupacabra's do exist'

Since the legend of the mythical Mexican predator first emerged, there have been 'sightings' of the Chupacabra all over the world.

One of these took place earlier this week in Piedmont, North Carolina, after a local spotted a mangy, fox-like creature fitting with the description bestowed on the 'goat-sucker' or 'devil-dog'.

A picture was taken by a woman called Ramona who sent it into a local news site with the caption, 'Chupacabras do exist!

Scientists have speculated that the creatures could be coyotes infected by parasites after one animal was discovered last July following a fatal attack on livestock.

The first reported sighting was in 1995, when eight sheep were found dead in Puerto Rico with identical puncture wounds to the chest and completely drained of blood.

Their mysterious deaths supposedly spawned the legend of the chupacabra in Latin America.

Months later, the creature was allegedly spotted in CanÃ³vanas, where as many as 150 animals had been killed.

Since then, there have been attacks allegedly carried out by the creature across South and Central America, and even into New Mexico and Texas.
