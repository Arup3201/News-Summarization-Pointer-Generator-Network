A piano teacher who bombarded a 13-year-old girl with sex texts has been spared jail after a plea from her parents for mercy.

Matthew Mark Kelsey, 24, has been given a community order for sending explicit texts and e-mails to the girl after her mother made a tearful appeal for him to be spared prison.

Speaking at Hull Crown Court yesterday, the mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, wept: 'She doesn’t support this. She hates me and her dad for causing all this.'

Kelsey, from Elloughton, East Yorks, had taught the girl to play piano before befriending her on Facebook.

They began sending each other explicit e-mails and texts. The court heard they eventually arranged to meet in his car around the corner from her East Riding school, where Kelsey kissed her.

The girl’s parents later discovered the messages and called the police however, the court heard they did not want him to be jailed.

Prosecutor Nick Adlington said: 'The defendant had been her piano teacher.

'He established contact with her when she started a Facebook account.

'The contact on Facebook developed from low-key, general conversation and pleasantries.

'She said she had a crush on someone older. He told her age was "just a number" if two people like each other.

'He suggested she could visit him at his home and tell her family she was going to stay with friends. He told her she should be careful and not tell anyone of their relationship.

'He also asked her if he could kiss her when they met and her response was affirmative.

'There is then a thread of sexually explicit comments.'

The girl’s mother asked the judge in the case not to jail Kelsey and said she hoped her daughter would not meet him again in secret.

She said: 'I hope she won’t. I’m not going to lie, I just don’t know. I didn’t even know she did Facebook.'

Mr Adlington said the attitude of the girl’s parents towards Kelsey was 'extremely charitable'.

He said: 'They have made it clear they are saddened it has gone to court and have no desire to see him receive a custodial sentence.'

Kelsey pleaded guilty to causing a child under the age of 16 to engage in sexual activity.

Judge Mark Bury told him: 'You are 24 years old, although I suspect you are a lot less emotionally.

'You got involved with a younger girl whom you met when you had a professional relationship.

'You began texting her and messaging her on Facebook over innocuous matters and then it became more personal.

'Then you were essentially talking about having a sexual relationship with her. You are remorseful and I take the view this was isolated behaviour on your part and behaviour that is not going to be repeated.

'Both your parents and the parents of the girl are sympathetic and supportive of you, which says something about you as a person.

'In all the circumstances it doesn’t seem to me to be necessary or appropriate to send you to custody.'

The judge did, however, warn Kelsey he faces a prison sentence if he is caught doing the same thing again.

Judge Bury told him: 'You have a lot of offer society in general and I take the view this is an isolated lapse due to your own difficult personal circumstances.

'If any harm had come to her the sentence would have been different.'

Kelsey was sentenced to a two-year supervised community order and ordered to attend a sex offenders’ treatment programme.

He was also given a five-year restraining order not to contact the child by phone or Facebook or go within 100 metres of her.

Kelsey must sign the sex offenders’ register for five years.
