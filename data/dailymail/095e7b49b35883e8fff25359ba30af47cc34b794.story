It sounds like the stuff of Hollywood fiction. But a pill that wipes out bad memories could eventually become reality, scientists believe.

Experiments on mice found those given fingolimod, a drug used to treat multiple sclerosis, completely forgot about previous experiences that had brought them physical pain.

The US study, at Virginia Commonwealth University, offers hope of a drug that could eradicate memories of traumatic events from years ago and help patients overcome phobias, eating disorders and even sexual hang-ups.

It mirrors the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which starred Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey, in which a couple used a technique to erase memories of each other when their relationship soured.

Fingolimod, available as a tablet under the brand name Gilenya, treats remitting forms of MS by suppressing the immune system.

Dr Sarah Spiegel, of the Virginia Commonwealth University, USA, and colleagues found it can also inhibit an enzyme called histone deacetylase, a key protein that regulates gene expression.

When fed to mice, fingolimod crossed the blood brain barrier and helped them quickly forget recent unpleasant episodes.

They were put in a chamber where their feet were exposed to a mild electric shock, and when returned to the cage their ‘freezing’ behaviour was recorded as a measure of anxiety.

This complete lack of movement, a characteristic fear response in rodents providing a good readout of memory, subsided rapidly after receiving the drug.

Dr Spiegel said: 'Fingolimod, a Food and Drug Administration approved drug for treatment of multiple sclerosis, has beneficial effects in the central nervous system that are not yet well understood.

'Fingolimod deserves consideration as an adjuvant therapy for post traumatic stress disorder and other anxiety disorders.'

In theory, such a pill could eradicate memories of traumatic events that happened years ago.

But there are ethical concerns that it could eradicate the very essence of what makes us human as well as have damaging psychological consequences, preventing those who take it from learning from their mistakes.

The ability to remove memories has been the stuff of science fiction for decades.
