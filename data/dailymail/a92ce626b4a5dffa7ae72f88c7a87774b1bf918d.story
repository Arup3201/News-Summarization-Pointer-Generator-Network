Angelina Jolie today appeared visibly moved and close to tears at the 'End Sexual Violence in Conflict' summit in London, which she is co-hosting with Foreign Secretary William Hague. The summit is the largest ever held on subject of sexual violence in war.

The actress' eyes welled up as she listened to victims of sexual assault speak about their experiences and spent time with them afterwards, discussing the issues they face and embracing delegates.

Clutching fellow activist and peacemaker Neema Namadamu on this, the second day of the summit, the actress struggled to contain her emotions.

Neema is an advocate for change in Congo, and founder of the Maman Shujaa, the 'Hero Women of the Congo’ who fight for the rights of women. She who was struck down with polio at age two, and became the first disabled woman to graduate from Congo’s national university.

She began campaigning when her 25-year-old daughter was attacked by a group of men metres from her own home in the Congo.

Angelina, Special Envoy of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, also embraced other delegates who spoke at the event.

After the formal talks, the actress took time to look at products made by women and sold by the International Campaign to Stop Rape and Gender Violence to support victim of violence.

The summit has seen diplomats, officials and non-profit representatives from more than 100 countries gather to press for the rights of victims of sexual violence — women, men and children alike.

With the cameras of the world focused on her, Jolie said she wanted to dedicated the conference to a rape victim she and Hague recently met in Bosnia.

‘She felt that having had no justice for her particular crime, in her particular situation, and having seen the actual man who raped her on the streets free, she really felt abandoned by the world,’ Jolie said.

‘This day is for her.’

Angelina was also interviewed on BBC Radio 4’s Women’s Hour this morning, talking about how she came to be involved in working to end sexual violence.

‘I’ve met survivors and spent time with them. I’d heard their stories and became very emotionally involved and I thought – what can I possibly do to help,’ she said.

Angelina also talked of losing her mother to breast cancer, and her decision to have a preventative double mastectomy: 'The thought of telling my children I had cancer because I didn't have the surgery was more frightening to me.'

'I am very happy that I made a decision that will enable me to be around for my children. For me it was in fact an easy choice.'

Of her mother Marcheline, she said: 'Had she had the surgery she might have been around for years longer to have met my other children.'

The programme also shared the harrowing accounts of two women who suffered sexual violence during conflict.

One un-named women described her attack during genocide in Rwanda in these words: ‘I didn’t see their faces, I don’t know them, how can you see someone who is hitting you in the eyes? How will you know someone who is inserting a gun barrel into your mouth, and then between your legs? Then he leaves, and another one enters.’

Another woman spoke of her attack in Minova in the Democratic Republic of Congo: ‘The man said that he wanted to rape me, that if I refused he is going to kill me. Then another five men came. They all raped me. My daughter keeps asking me about her dad. When I try to reveal who her father is, it is really hard for me.

Angelina, here greeting Neema Namadamu, has been key in organising the summit which is being attended by governments from over 100 countries, over 900 experts, NGOs, Faith leaders, and representatives from international organisations across the world

Neema, who is disabled after having polio as a child, sat as her and Angelina talked for some time following the speeches

‘I fear also telling her because a lot of men raped me… it is really hard for me to tell my daughter.

‘I just feel really depressed, when I think of it I burst into tears.  I feel like I am nothing. Sometimes  I even feel like dying .’

A rape survivor who attended the conference today, Wangu Kanja, from Kenya, who has set up her own organization to help others, said she hoped the summit will send a message that governments cannot continue to ignore the issue.

'I'm really hoping that from this the Kenyan government will be forced to do something,' she said hours after the summit began.

William Hague compared sexual violence in war zones to slavery as an injustice that demands action.

'As was said with slavery in the 18th century, now we know the facts, we cannot turn aside,' he said.

Others far afield also offered support. Pope Francis, who has made combatting sex trafficking and human slavery one of his priorities, sent a tweet on Tuesday in support of the summit's work, saying 'Let us pray for all victims of sexual violence in conflict, and those working to end this crime.'

Hague and Jolie are set to launch a guidance document on best practices today to help strengthen prosecutions for rape in conflicts. Hague will also host a meeting Thursday on tackling Boko Haram, the Islamic terror group that abducted more than 300 schoolgirls and young women in Nigeria in April.

As well as speaking at the conference, Angelina was interviewed on BBC Radio 4's Women's Hour this morning, talking about how she came to be involved in working to end sexual violence

Angelina and Hague have been campaigning on the issue of sexual violence for two years

The pair have campaigned hard on the issue of sexual violence for two years, and on Tuesday they were welcomed with cheers from others fighting for the cause as they toured a lively fringe program featuring photo exhibitions, poetry readings, and artists performing skits.

Nigerian rap and soul singers sang about rape and other problems facing young Africans, while volunteers taught Swahili folk songs in workshops similar to those performed in conflict zones to help reduce trauma. An eclectic group of charity workers and computer experts brainstormed on ways to use technology to improve reporting on sexual violence.
