The extent of the influence the 
Prince of Wales has over government legislation has been laid bare in 
letters between ministers and Clarence House.

They reveal how permission has been 
sought from Prince Charles before passing laws in at least a dozen 
separate areas during the past five years, from road safety and energy 
reforms to gambling and planning.

The papers shed light for the first 
time on how the Royal has been consulted on Bills that may affect his 
estate before they are debated in Parliament.

Influence: Documents revealed the Prince of Wales indicated he was 'content' with the Bill

In November 2008 Huw Irranca-Davies, then a Labour minister, wrote to the Prince’s Private Secretary Sir Michael Peat to consult him on the Marine and Coastal Access Bill, according to the Daily Telegraph.

The letters include two copies of the Bill in its draft form and a detailed summary of how it could affect the Duchy, the Prince’s private estate.

The Private Secretary responded two months later, thanking Mr Irranca-Davies and replying: ‘I can confirm that the Prince of Wales is content with the Bill’.

The response reveals the level of influence the Prince appears to wield in matters of legislation and appears to suggest he sees his role as going further than that envisaged by ministers.

The requirement for ministers have been forced to seek permission stems from a little-known constitutional right for the prince to effectively veto legislation in areas which might affect his private interests.

Although it is known the Prince's permission has been sought in the past, the newly released correspondence is the first time light has been shed on the process, as Government and Clarence House have refused to comment.

The documents were released by the Information Commissioner, after an initial application by John Kirkhope, a public notary and graduate law student at Plymouth University, was turned down by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).

The Commissioner ruled that part of the correspondence could be released as it concerned the Prince’s role as landowner rather than heir to the throne. Other documents still remain secret.

Mr Kirkhope said it was clear there would be other unpublished cases where the Prince may have raised objections.

‘The real issue is about those Acts where there are changes made to the Act as a result of representations made by the Prince,’ he told the paper. 

A spokesman for the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs commented that the Prince’s consent relates only to the aspects concerning the Duchy, although it was ‘expressed to be to the Bill itself’.

But the revelation about the Prince's power of 
consent could add to concerns the heir to the throne may be overstepping 
his constitutional role.

The Prince's role in government 
matters has been criticised in the past, with him facing accusations
of unconstitutional ‘meddling’ in politics.

Documents
released under a Freedom of Information Act last year revealed Charles 
held at least nine private meetings with ministers during a ten-month 
period from May 2010.

They show he appeared to focus on 
ministers responsible for his ‘hobby horse’ issues, such as global 
warming, conservation, architecture and agriculture.

The
published diaries of Alastair Campbell also claimed Tony Blair became 
so exasperated by the prince’s high-profile interventions while he was 
Prime Minister that he complained to the Queen.
