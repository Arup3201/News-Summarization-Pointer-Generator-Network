They say dogs are man's best friend. Now one enterprising clairvoyant has gone one step further - making her dogs her business partners.

Linda Lancashire, a grandmother from Derbyshire, says her two poodles can sniff out health, money and relationship problems - before relaying their findings to her.

The 59-year-old, who says she counts politicians and Paralympians among her clients, has run her clairvoyant business from her bungalow, named Broomsticks, for more than 40 years and says she has a very long but secret list of celebrity clients.

Man's best friend: Linda Lancashire, a psychic grandmother who has read tarot cards for everyone from politicians to paralympians, has a little help from her poodles- who she claims are psychic

Linda, from Heanor, Derbyshire, bought twin apricot poodles Hilda and Tallulah three years ago after she was left heartbroken by the death of her loyal airedale, Stanley Rupert.

The dogs, which are known as 'The Lulas', sit in on her sessions and paw her and stand up on their hind legs to relay to Linda personal details about her clients.

Linda uses tarot cards, her crystal ball, and now her canine companions to help her pick up her clients' energy and assist them in matters of love, money and health.

When in a session, Hilda will touch the person on the arm for example if it is a health problem. And if it is a relationship issue, Tallulah won't leave Linda alone.

Linda said: 'As Tallulah and Hilda were growing up they were always sat in my office and when clients were sitting in front of me, "The Lulas" would start pawing me and they wouldn't leave me alone.

'Tallulah can detect relationship issues and will say "mummy listen to me, this lady is not happy" in my mind. Hilda knows when someone has money or health problems.

'I don't know how they do it. But my clients are amazed by them and now come especially for the poodles and want them to sit on the sofa with them.

'I love them with a passion and they sleep with me on the bed under their fleecey throw.'

Linda always knew that she was different from other people, but did not realise her gift until she was older.

Broomsticks: Linda has run her clairvoyant business from her home, named Broomsticks, for more than 40 years

She claims she has always had a very good sixth sense and intuition and charges her clients £40 per session.

Linda said: 'It's a gift that I can't describe. I don't see ghosts but I do feel, sense and smell things.

'I can feel if someone is a good person and I can smell emotions. The smells are different kinds of smells to perfumes or body lotions - they are not of this realm.

'We are all different. Some people can play piano and I can't. I am not special or anything, I am just different.'

Linda's parents emigrated to the UK from Poland. She used to work as a secretary and had also worked in factories and as a cleaner, but always felt she was destined for more spiritual things.

As the phone calls from clients began to flood in, Linda started to rack up some impressive celebrity visitors.

She said: 'I just said to myself one day, "I am never going to work for anyone else again because I am so different," so I left work and put an advert in Prediction magazine and then the rest is history.'

'I meet people from all walks of life. I see people from stage and screen and politics but I have incredible integrity - and I work confidentially.'

She had always loved animals and says she prefers them to people because they love unconditionally and are very loyal.

Linda's sidekick was a dog called Stanley Rupert, until he passed away in 2009.

Just the three of us: Linda is single and says she prefers dogs to human because they are loyal

Tuning in: She claims her dogs can tune into people's energy and has a list of celebrity clientele

She claims dogs can tune in to a higher frequency than humans, and that is how they predict the future and uncover secrets.

Although Stanley was not psychic like the poodles, Linda was certain that he had a sixth sense.

Linda said: 'I have been living on my own and have been single for years out of choice. If anyone came into my life who was not good, Stanley would become ill.

'It was strange because one minute he would be sick with bile and the next he would be running around like a lunatic once he knew that I had made a sensible decision not to associate with that person. He was my barometer.'

Linda was heartbroken when Stanley died of organ failure at 11 years old.

Heartbreak: Linda bought the twin poodles three years ago when she was left heartbroken by the death of her loyal airedale, Stanley Rupert

She said: 'I was bereft until the Lulas arrived. Stanley had a squeaky Santa toy that he always used to chew.

'Even after he died, this Santa toy would squeak for no reason. When the Lulas arrived, it just stopped as if by magic.

'He must have stayed with me until he knew I was happy with my two new Lulas and I am convinced he brought the three of us together.'

Linda said she is estranged from her family apart from her daughter Katie. Katie has two sons, Ben, four, and Finlay, three.

Linda has been married twice and is good friends with Katie's father and his wife.

Katie, 34, has followed in her mother's footsteps and works as a psychic but is now launching her new business as an interior designer and uses her psychic abilities to tune into the owner's vibrations and personality.

Linda said: 'Katie is very gifted too and has been able to see spirits since she was little.

'She went to Hull University and studied media and went on to work on a newspaper. But it wasn't right for her.

'I always said to her that one day she would come back to her psychic gift. If you are meant to do something, the powers that be will make sure you do.

'We all have a fate to follow. It is all planned out before we are born. This earth is for learning, it is a school.'
