Alex Zane may be a well-known music-lover, but he is happy to avoid Ibiza's sprawling nightclubs

He may be a well-known music-lover having hosted high-profile shows on MTV, XFM and NME Radio.

But Alex Zane reveals he more than happy to shun the masses of Ibiza's hard-partying tourists, booming beats and sprawling nightclubs to take a trip to the north of the island, which is littered with breath-taking beaches.

The 35-year-old presenter says the Spanish island has 'two characters' explaining the tranquil villages and peaceful orange groves are just a bike-ride away and offer the opportunity to 'live like a local'.

Read our Q and A with Alex to find out how he spends his time on the island.

Many people are cautious of visiting Ibiza as they think it's all about clubbing and rowdy youngsters. But what else has the island got to offer?

'Ibiza is an island of two characters; the south which is devoted to the mega clubs and party-goers and the other, lesser known Northern side of the island, which is peaceful, tranquil and full of unspoilt beauty.

Of course, the boundaries aren't as clear cut as this, but for every all-night DJ session there is an early morning sunrise at one of the many breath-taking little coves that litter the Island. 

The nightlife may have gained a reputation for the island amongst tourists, but it's this other side to Ibiza that the locals rave about. 

If you are one of the 50 per cent of Brits who, according to research by American Express, are after the authentic experience of 'living like a local', then the best way to explore this quieter side of the island is to hop on a bike and get off the beaten track to explore the many villages, peaceful orange groves and quaint little restaurants that tourists don't usually get to experience. 

I guarantee you won't hear a baseline the whole time you are there.'

Alex Zane recommends escaping Ibiza's crowded clubbing areas and visiting the island's northern coast. Beaches such as Cala de Sant Vicent (pictured) can be found on the North East of Ibiza

Best restaurant?

'My favourite restaurant on the island is a little family owned place called Sabores Naturales in the centre of the small town of San Juan. 

It's got a quiet courtyard outside where you can just sit, relax, eat, drink and let time pass you by without a care. 

All the food is vegetarian and organic with fresh fruit juices and, in my opinion, the best homemade pizza on the island.'

Best beach?

'Picking my favourite beach in Ibiza is a bit of a tricky one. If I did have to choose though, it would probably be Cala Xuclar. 

It felt like I was on a tropical beach without the long-haul flying. 

With great views and white sand, combined with a few fisherman's huts and a tiny kiosk serving food, it was the perfect place to escape from it all.'

Best place to stay?

'If you are going in search of sunset bike rides and early morning strolls around the old towns, then I'd advise staying in any one of the boutique hotels in the north of the island, like the Hotel Hacienda Na Xamena, with its series of spa pools and waterfalls built into the cliff face.

We stayed in Can Curreu and it's safe to say that that the view from the breakfast table made the early starts much better.'

Your favourite thing about Ibiza and why?

'My favourite thing about Ibiza is discovering the hidden gems of the island. 

When you say to people you are heading on holiday to Ibiza, they immediately imagine rows of sun beds on the beaches and overcrowded bars blasting out music. 

Yet you only need to venture a little off the tourist trails and, even in peak season, you can find stunning, empty beaches and relaxing places to sit for a drink. 

Perhaps the island's reputation has meant less people visit Ibiza in search of a rejuvenating holiday. For whatever the reason, they're missing out.'

What are your packing essentials?

'Packing light is the key if, like me, you enjoy moving around a lot. There's nothing worse than heaving a giant case jammed full of clothes to lug on and off various forms of transport. As long as you've got one smart outfit in there and the facilities to clean it you'll be fine. 

And if you don't have the facilities to clean it, you're probably not in a place you're going to need it in the first place.'

Which destination is top of your wishlist?

'I'd like to explore more of South America. I've seen a lot of Brazil: Rio, Sao Paulo and up to Manaus and then deep into the Rain forest, but that's it. I'd really like to go further south to Argentina.'

What is your earliest travel memory?

'Scotland. I remember being in Scotland so much as a kid. My mum often took myself and my brother to stay on the West Coast. We spent time on Skye, around Oban and Arisaig and then on the banks of Loch Awe. It is still one of my favourite places in the world to spend time… stunning scenery, wild weather and fascinating history.'
