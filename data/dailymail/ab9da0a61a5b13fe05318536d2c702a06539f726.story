Tragic: Ryan Acaster, 17, was killed after he was catapulted from his trail bike by a wire a nursery firm gamekeeper had tied to two trees as a makeshift fence in Merseyside

A nursery firm has been ordered to pay out £50,000 over the death of a teenager who was thrown off his motorbike when he rode it into a makeshift wire fence.

Ryan Acaster, 17, suffered severe head injuries when he was catapulted off his 110cc off-road bike after hitting a line tied between two trees on land close to Crossens, Lancashire in 2008.

He was found unconscious by his father Dean lying near his bike and airlifted to Royal Preston Hospital, but later died from his injuries.

Bosses at Nursery firm JA Jones & Sons have now pleaded guilty to causing his death at Liverpool Crown Court.

The court heard that the company's gamekeeper Adrian Johnson erected the wire along with a sign in a bid to deter trespassers from entering private land.

The sign, however, was taken down by an unknown person, and replaced with a 'grubby white T-shirt'.

As Ryan rode along the track he failed to spot the marker and hit the wire, which had been tied at around chest height.

Prosecuting, Nigel Lawrence said: 'The cable should have been removed while there was no sign present and Adrian Johnson should have done more to alert people to the potential danger.

'Such failures by the company gave rise to the potential of danger, a danger that ultimately claimed the life of Ryan Acaster.

'The cable and shirt combination presented a foreseeable risk of serious injury and should have been dealt with accordingly.'

Judge Thomas Teague added: 'Unfortunately, the metal sign was at some point removed by some unknown and unauthorised person.

'When the loss was discovered by Mr 
Johnson’s stepbrother, he replaced it by the crude expedient of 
attaching what has been accurately described as a “grubby white T-shirt”
to the middle of the cable.

'The cable in its altered state was inconspicuous, particularly as it was shaded by trees on either side of the track.

'Despite the fact that Ryan Acaster was probably driving at less than 20 mph, he would have had little time to react to its presence by the time he saw it.

'To those who loved Ryan, no sentence will seem remotely adequate, and they are right to think so. His life was priceless and could never be measured in monetary terms.'

Speaking after the verdict, Ryan's devastated father Dean slammed the 'hollow apology' his family had received from the company during the judgment.

Guilty: JA Jones & Sons pleaded guilty in Liverpool Crown Court and were ordered to pay a £50,000 fine over the death of teenager Ryan Acaster

He said: 'It’s nice to get some sort of justice. Today was the only time we have received an apology in five years - it was a bit of a hollow apology.

'I
want to thank the Health and Safety (Executive), they were the only 
ones that have stuck by us throughout all of this and we’re pleased with
today’s outcome.

'Losing
a child for anyone is devastating and we hope the judge’s actions will 
deter anyone who is thinking of doing something similar and to stop any 
other family having to go through what we’ve gone through.

'Ryan
loved life. He was a typical 17 year-old getting ready for his adult 
life. He was a happy-go-lucky lad who always had a smile on his face.

'The wheels of justice turn very 
slowly. It’s taken five years but that’ll never change what’s happened 
so today’s the end of a chapter for us.

'No
amount of fine would have made us feel better but all I hope that 
people who are thinking of doing something irresponsible like this will 
think about the suffering it could cause.'

JA Jones & Sons now have four years to pay the fine, which amounts to over £100,000 including legal costs.

HSE Inspector Lisa Bailey, who helped the Acaster family bring the case to trial, said: 'Ryan’s tragic death at such a young age could have been avoided if JA Jones & Sons had thought more the potential consequences of erecting the cable.

'It was strung between two trees in a dark, wooded area part of the way down the track, which made it difficult to see for anyone travelling towards it.

'Sadly, Ryan was thrown from his bike when he collided with the cable and suffered fatal head injuries as a result.

'If the company wanted to stop people from using the track then it should have installed a proper barrier or warning sign at the entrance. That way, it could have kept vehicles away without putting lives in danger.'
