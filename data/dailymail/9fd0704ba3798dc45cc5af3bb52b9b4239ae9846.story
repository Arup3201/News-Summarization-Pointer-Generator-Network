Jose Mourinho's former assistant at Real Madrid Aitor Karanka has lavished praise on the Chelsea manager, explaining how the Portuguese boss ended Barcelona's La Liga dominance and the 'love' which the squad at the Bernabeu held for him.

Middlesbrough boss Karanka also believes Mourinho's successor, Carlo Ancelotti, is held in the same high esteem by his 'far superior' side as the Portuguese was during his time there.

Karanka is extremely positive in his views on his former boss, and puts a lot of his own success down to his mentor's teaching and principles.

In a wide-ranging interview with newspaper ABC, published by AS, Karanka said: 'He (Mourinho) is the best coach in the world. He has shown it. And tactically he is a hundred steps ahead of the others. 

'He came (to Madrid) after stopping Barcelona before, with Inter (Milan). Barca had won six titles and Jose stopped them. If not for him, they would have repeated another six titles.'

During their time at Madrid together, Mourinho and Karanka won La Liga once and the Copa del Rey, in the process ending Barca's dominance of the Spanish title.

And the 41-year-old has been impressed with the man who replaced Mourinho, Ancelotti.

The Italian won the Champions League in his first season at the Bernabeu, finally achieving La Decima - Real's 10th European Cup victory.

Such a victory has, in Karanka's opinion, elevated Ancelotti to the same place in the hearts of Real players and fans as Mourinho. 

Speaking about Ancelotti, Karanka added: 'They play very well. They are far superior to the rest (of the teams in Europe). Madrid finally won the Decima (their 10th European Cup) and removed the anxiety that they felt for many years.

'Ancelotti is a good manager of the group. Also, I look at him and I learn. The players love him, like they love Mourinho. It was said that he didn't talk to the squad but that was a lie. Iker (Casillas) has said that Jose cared for him every day.' 

After leaving Madrid in 2013, Karanka took on his first managerial job on Teesside and has achieved some success so far.

Karanka has praised Mourinho and believes he has learned a lot of important traits from the Portuguese

Boro currently sit joint-second in the Championship, despite operating on a low budget, and Karanka has adapted to the job extremely quickly.

And, perhaps unsurprisingly, he attributes a lot of that to Mourinho's guidance, as well as the three players he has been able to loan from Chelsea - defender Kenneth Omeruo, midfielder Patrick Bamford and goalkeeper Jamal Blackman.

'From Mourinho I learned that what is fundamental is that the players feel happy. He supported me a lot to come here (to Middlesbrough). He told me that it was a good place to grow and to fulfil myself.

'Chelsea have loaned us three footballers. After each match we speak and exchange messages. He gives me advice - the best that he has given me, since I worked with him during those three wonderful years at Real Madrid, is that the team is above individuals.'
