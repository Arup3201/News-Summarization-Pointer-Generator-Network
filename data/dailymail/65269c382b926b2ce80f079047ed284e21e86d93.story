Islamic State executioner Jihadi John managed to escape from Britain by hiding in the back of a freight lorry on a ferry crossing the Channel, it has been claimed.

The 26-year-old, who has been named as Mohammed Emwazi, a university graduate from Queen's Park, London, was able to flee to Syria despite being on an MI5 watchlist and being monitored by Scotland Yard's counter-terrorism command.

Now the Home Office could face fresh questions over border controls after it is thought that Emwazi used a well-worn route to leave the UK.

A source told The Times that the extremist hid in a lorry, which crossed the Channel on a ferry to France and that he was then able to travel across Europe unchecked until he reached Turkey.

They added that he passed through the Turkish border with ease and then continued his journey to Syria to join up with ISIS in early 2013.

Emwazi has been on the radar of MI5 since May 2009, when it is thought he tried to reach Somalia to join Islamist terror group al-Shabaab.

He was stopped with two associates in Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, where he told officials they were en route to a safari.

Lee Rigby's killer Michael Adebolajo was picked up by the SAS and MI5 in similar fashion as he tried to enter the east African country in November 2010.

After being detained by police and held overnight and deported, Emwazi flew to Amsterdam, before being returned to the UK.

He claimed that an officer from MI5 accused him of trying to reach Somalia and that they even tried to recruit him to join the organisation.

He claimed he was harassed by the security services, and even complained to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. 

Emwazi was then placed on a terror watch list, which prevented him from travelling to any Muslim country.

The Home Office are already facing questions after it emerged between 2009 and 2010, Emwazi travelled between London and Kuwait at least twice.

In June 2010, he was detained by counter-terrorism officials in Britain who fingerprinted him and searching his belongings.

The next day – to Emwazi’s fury, given he claimed to have a job and bride-to-be in Kuwait – he was prevented from flying.

A possible attempt to leave London for Saudi Arabia in 2012 was also blocked.

But after managing to leave Britain for Syria, he has gained global notoriety as the masked killer of Western hostages including British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines in ISIS beheading videos which have shocked the world.

Emwazi was born in Kuwait to a stateless family of Iraqi origin. His parents moved to Britain in 1993 after their hopes of obtaining Kuwaiti citizenship were quashed.

Meanwhile, Emwazi's father, Jasem Emwazi, has said he is not sure that his son is masked ISIS butcher Jihadi John, according to his lawyer.

The 51-year-old feels there is 'no proof' that the black-clad knife-wielding man featured in chilling hostage execution videos is his eldest child, it was reported today.

His Kuwaiti lawyer, Salem Al-Hashah, told Kuwait's respected Al-Qabas newspaper: 'He is not sure that he [Jihadi John] is his son.

'There is no proof that the man shown in the videos and photographs is his son, as the media has reported in the last few days.'

He added: 'There is no evidence that Mohammed is the man in the videos because his face was covered.'

The lawyer's comments appear to contradict earlier remarks made by Mr Emwazi, who is said to have told a colleague that his son is 'a dog, an animal, a terrorist' and called for him to be killed.

Mr Emwazi, who moved to the UK from his native Kuwait in 1994 and holds a British passport, was seen in public for the first time today since he was questioned by Kuwaiti police at the weekend about his son's activities.

Mr Al-Hashah said the father is not responsible for what his son has done and that there is nothing to prove his father agreed with his son, or helped him in any way. 

The lawyer added: 'Jasem Emwazi is under stress. Many people are calling him names. He can't leave his home and can't walk outside. He is scared of people because everyone believes all the rumours that have been written about him.' 

The Daily Mail revealed yesterday that housing and state benefits for Emwazi's family since they came to the UK from Kuwait 20 years ago has cost taxpayers £400,000.

After his father returned to Kuwait, other members of his family in Britain have been moved out of their homes for their own protection and are being guarded at a cost of £5,000 a day.
