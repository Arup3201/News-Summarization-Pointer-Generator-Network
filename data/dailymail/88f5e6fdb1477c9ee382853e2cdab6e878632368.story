President Barack Obama didn't get three minutes into a speech this morning in Kansas City, Missouri, before being interrupted by a heckler.

Obama had just launched into a story about his dining experience the evening before when a woman in the balcony area of the venue began shouting at him.

'I'm sorry, what are you hollering about?' he asked.'Jesus is the God of Israel. He is fully God,' she responded.'I believe in God. Thanks for the prayer. Amen. Thank you,' Obama told the woman as she was escorted out of the theater.

'Jesus is the God of Israel. He is fully God': A woman yells at President Barack Obama during his speech on the economy this afternoon at the Uptown Theater in Kansas City, Missouri

The woman was eventually escorted out of the theater by police

But not before the president could respond to her. 'I believe in God,' he told her

After the yelling had subsided Obama attempted to return to his story, but he was quickly interrupted a group of attendees chanting, 'We love you!'

Eventually, the president got back on topic: his visit to famed Kansas City barbeque joint Arthur Bryant's.

'I just want to be on record, though, because people have been asking me this question.  I deal with a lot of tough issues -- I am not going to decide who makes the best barbecue in Kansas City,' Obama said to laughter from the audience.

Obama said 'Bryant’s barbecue was tasty,' and he 'did plow through it pretty good' but he hadn't eaten at enough of city's barbeque restaurants to hand out the honor.

'So I’m going to have to try some other barbecue the next time I come in,' he told the audience.

The president was explaining that he was in Kansas City not only for its world famous barbeque, but to meet with people who wrote him letters when he was interrupted yet again by an audience member who told him: 'I wrote you, too!'

'Well, you know what, if I had known, I would have had you over for dinner, too,' the president said, to laughter.

Obama went on to explain that every night he reads a sample of 10 letters from Americans. 'And folks tell me their stories -- they tell me their worries and their hopes and their hardships, their successes,' he said.

'Some say I’m doing a good job. But other people say, “You’re an idiot.” '

Obama said he didn't mind reading hate mail, though, because 'this is how I know that I’m getting a good sample of letters.'

Afterward, the president took a stroll along Main Street, where shook hands with Parkville residents while drinking an iced tea  

The president met with four of the letter writers last night at Arthur Bryant's, including a man named Victor Fugate, who introduced the president today ahead of his speech at Kansas City's Uptown Theater.

The White House says Fugate wrote Obama in January of 2012 to thank him for the student loan assistance he received from the federal government as part of the Obama administration's Income Based Repayment Plan.

According to the White House, Fugate is also a beneficiary of Obamacare, having enrolled in an exchange after he lost his job.

'I am thankful for the Affordable Care Act. That's probably the biggest reason that I wrote a letter to the president,' he told attendees of Obama's speech today.

As far as his dinner with the president last night is concerned, Fugate said: 'If the First Lady is watching, it was a beautiful salad.'

Obama actually had a half slab of ribs. He would have also had a side of cole slaw, but by the time the president arrived at the restaurant, it had run out for the day.

'You've got to have some coleslaw around here, don't you?' Obama playfully told the cashier. 'You're out of it? You didn't save any for me?'

'Come on, man, I thought you were going to hook me up.'

The president didn't indulge in any more BBQ before leaving the Kansas City area today, but he did stop by a coffee shop in Parkville, Missouri, where he purchased an iced tea and refills for the small business' six patrons.

An employee offered Obama a tea with lavender, but he declined.

'I'm not confident enough to order that,' he said, according to a reporter present.
