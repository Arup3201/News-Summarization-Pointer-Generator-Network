The New Jersey man accused of murdering his pageant-queen ex-girlfriend is now facing additional charges of aggravated sexual assault for her rape.

Mary Greff, 23, was discovered strangled to death in her parent's Waldwick, New Jersey home last month. Her ex-boyfriend, 22-year-old Mark Spatucci, is accused of entering the home through the second-floor window and killing her when an argument turned nasty, all while their infant son slept in a crib in the same room.

But prosecutors added additional charges today after an autopsy revealed that Greff had been raped before being killed. In Bergen County court this morning, Spatucci plead not guilty to two counts of sexual assault and one count of felony murder.

In court this morning, additional charges of sexual assault were lodged against Spatucci after an autopsy revealed that Greff had been raped before her death

Witness: The whole incident took place in front of the couple's eight-month-old child

Spatucci is currently being held on $2 million bond and is scheduled to appear in court on Friday morning.

Greff's parents were believed to be asleep in another part of the house during the tragic incident.

The 23-year-old woman was a competitor in Miss New Jersey Teen USA in 2008.

Prosecutors said Greff and Spatucci began dating two years ago, that she gave birth in February and that the two had lived together for a short time before she split from him and moved in with her parents.

Investigators believe Spatucci drove to the Greff residence late Tuesday and entered, undetected, through a second-floor window.

Once inside Greff's bedroom, prosecutors say an argument became violent and Spatucci killed her, leaving the body on the bed.

Her father found her dead early Wednesday, police said. WABC reported that Greff's parents left the home to run some errands in the morning and then got back to make a horrific discovery.

'They left in the morning, and it wasn't until they returned when they realized that they had not heard from their daughter,' Bergen County Prosecutor James Molinelli said.

'So that's when the father went upstairs and found the body,' Molinelli added.

Prosecutors said Spatucci had court-ordered custody visitation with the infant but Greff had full custody.

Spatucci was located late Wednesday in Midland Park and taken into custody for questioning.

He was charged Thursday with murder, felony murder, burglary, endangering the welfare of a child and hindering apprehension. It wasn't immediately clear if he had an attorney.
