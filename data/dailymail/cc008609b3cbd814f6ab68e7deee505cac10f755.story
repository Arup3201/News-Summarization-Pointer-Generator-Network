Two of England’s greatest goalscorers, Sir Bobby Charlton and Alan Shearer, backed Wayne Rooney to shine at the World Cup.

Rooney, who has failed to score in the last two tournaments in Germany and South Africa, is coming under pressure for his place in Brazil after another  lacklustre showing against Peru  last week.

But as England prepare to face Ecuador tonight, Charlton, whose international record of 49 goals puts him 11 ahead of Rooney, thinks that the Manchester United striker is the only truly world-class player in Roy Hodgson’s squad.

Time to shine: Wayne Rooney will start for England against Ecuador

Time to impress: Rooney will look to get on the score sheet against Ecuador

‘Wayne Rooney will have to play,’ Charlton told Laureus.com. ‘He’s got that something extra. He will thrive on a successful performance in the World Cup.

‘Wayne Rooney is the only one that comes to mind when you think, “Where are our class players coming from?”

‘In every position there seems to be a little bit of doubt in my mind, apart from Wayne Rooney.

Golden boot: Alan Shearer was the top scorer at Euro 96 despite going into the tournament under pressure

Backing: Sir Bobby Charlton says Rooney is England's only star

‘I tell 
him, “If anybody is going to beat my record for the number of goals 
scored, it had better be you, so don’t let me down”, and he said “OK”.

‘He has a quality that is made for a World Cup.’

Shearer, who scored 30 goals for England and won the Golden Boot at Euro 96, claims that Rooney can finish as the World Cup’s top scorer if Hodgson gives him a vote of confidence now.

The former Newcastle striker said: ‘Three weeks before Euro 96, Terry (Venables) said to me, “Whatever happens between now and the first game you’re going to start”. That gave me great confidence.

'I think Roy Hodgson will say the same to Rooney. I finished the tournament as top scorer and Wayne can do the same.

‘I don’t think Wayne Rooney will want it on his record that he’s been to three World Cups and not scored in any.

‘He should start against Italy (in the first group game on June 14) but then it’s whether he performs or not because we have other players now who can produce moments of magic.

‘Sturridge can score as he showed the other night. The pressure is on Rooney like there is on any other player. He’s one of the biggest names in the world so everyone wants to talk about him.’
