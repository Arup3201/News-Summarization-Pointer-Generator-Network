One is exactly the same size as David Ortiz and the other is pretty much normal for his age, but both these 13-year-olds can hit the ball straight out of the park.

They may look like a (very) big brother standing next to his younger sibling, but 6'4" Erick Figueroa and 4'8" Ruy Martinez are quickly emerging as the stars of the 68th Little League Baseball World Series underway in Williamsport, Pennsylvania.

Proving that size is not everything, Martinez stunned spectators on Monday when the infielder helped Mexico to a 6-2 win over Australia with a huge third hit straight down center field in the fifth innings.

Same age: Ruy Martinez, 13, stands next to Erick Figueroa, also 13 as they celebrate their individual success for Mexico and the Caribbean Region respectively at the Little League World Series in Pennsylvania this week

At totally the other end of the scale, but no less impressive, is Figueroa, who weighs in at 229 pounds.

Put into perspective for those with a passing interest in the game, 13-year-old Figueroa, who represents the Caribbean team is comparable to Big Papi of the Boston Red Sox, who at 38-year-old has hit the 36th most homers in MLB history.

Indeed, larger than most Major League Baseball players, Figueroa has been slugging away at the annual competition, taking the tournament by storm.

Doing a quick search of baseball reference sites throws up the staggering fact that out of hundreds of professional MLB players, only 32 are at least 6'4" and above 229 pounds.

Little bit of magic: Ruy Martinez is about to strike his home run against Australia on Monday - to lead Mexico to a 6-2 win over their antipodean rivals and (right) practices in the cages beforehand

Enormous: Erick Figueroa is only 13, but the Little League player is exactly the same size as Boston Red Sox super star David Ortiz

Superstar: Boston Red Sox designated hitter David Ortiz is 6'4" and weighs, 229 pounds - exactly the same as 13-year-old Erick Figueroa

Figueroa, from Puerto Rico, has been using his enormous comparative size to his advantage and like, tiny Martinez, helped his team swat away Australia last week.

But it's not just the boys who are excelling at the Little League World Series.

Mo'ne Davis, 13, is has been sending down pitches of up to 70mph as she managed two consecutive shutouts in a row.

Davis led her Philadelphia team to victory last week as she became the first girl to throw a shutout in the history of the Little League World Series.

Davis is only the fourth American girl to play in the Little League World Series and the first since 2004.
