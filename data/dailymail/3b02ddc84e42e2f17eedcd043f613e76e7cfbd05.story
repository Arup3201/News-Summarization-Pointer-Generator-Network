An overwhelming majority of English voters hope Scotland will remain part of the United Kingdom, a poll reveals today.

But they say that regardless of the referendum result, Scottish MPs at Westminster should be stripped of the right to vote on issues which have been devolved to Holyrood.

And if Scotland does vote for independence next Thursday, a clear majority of English people believe they should not be allowed to keep the pound – a slap in the face for Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond.

The Populus survey for the Daily Mail shows that 70 per cent of voters in England want Scotland to stay in the UK, with just 20 per cent happy to see it break away in next week’s referendum.

The finding contradicts suggestions that most English voters would be only too happy to wave goodbye to Scotland.

The poll also shows that many English voters are unhappy that the future of the UK has been left entirely to the Scots. Fifty-six per cent believe voters in England, Wales and Northern Ireland should have been given a say in such a fundamental decision.

But the survey also reveals growing English resentment at the raw deal England gets from the current devolution arrangements.

Almost two-thirds said Scottish MPs at Westminster should be barred from voting on devolved issues that no longer affect their constituents.

Such a move would prevent Scotland’s MPs voting on a wide range of issues, including health, education, transport, criminal justice and local government.

But, if plans to hand the Scottish parliament powers over tax and welfare go ahead, Scottish MPs could also be barred from voting on the Budget – potentially jeopardising the chances of a future Labour government enacting its main policies.

First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond last week celebrated when a shock poll claimed 51 per cent of Scottish voters had sided with the Yes campaign. The Better Together crusade has since taken over again in some polls

The move was floated by the Conservatives in opposition and is now being considered seriously again by senior Tories.

The poll suggests broad support for giving Scotland more powers if it remains in the UK, with 48 per cent supporting the idea and 26 per cent opposed.

But it deals a major blow to Mr Salmond’s demand that an independent Scotland should be allowed to continue to use the pound as part of a currency union with the rest of the UK.

Barely a quarter (26 per cent) of English voters support the move, with 53 per cent saying an independent Scotland should not be allowed to keep the pound.

David Cameron urged voters in Edinburgh to sway towards the No campaign while Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg visited voters in Selkirk in a last-ditch attempt to save the union this week 

All three main parties at Westminster have ruled out a currency union with an independent Scotland, as has the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney.

Mr Salmond insists that a deal is possible, but today’s poll suggests that any attempt would be firmly rejected by English voters. This would leave Scotland forced to set up its own currency, join the euro, or continue to use the pound without the backing of the Bank of England.

The last of these options would leave it unable to set interest rates or limit borrowing, and would remove protection for its banks.

The overwhelming majority of English voters also believe Scotland should be forced to take its share of the UK national debt if it does go independent.

With just six days until the historic referendum, the poll reveals most English voters want the Scots to remain part of the UK despite claims by the Yes campaign that the country would be better off separated 

The poll is revealed after contrasting reports found different campaigns to be in the lead with less than a week until the referendum 

Only 4 per cent believe the Scots should be let off the hook, with 83 per cent saying Scotland should be forced to pay its way.

But there was better news for Mr Salmond on the monarchy, with 40 per cent of people in England happy for the Queen to remain as Scotland’s head of state, and only 26 per cent opposed.

The Queen is thought to be alarmed and saddened by the prospect of the break-up of the UK. But the majority of voters (51 per cent) believe she should resist calls to intervene in the debate, with 29 per cent saying she should speak out.
