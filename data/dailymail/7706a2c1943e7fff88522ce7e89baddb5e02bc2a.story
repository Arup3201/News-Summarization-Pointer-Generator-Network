Many unlucky dog owners know just how hard a task it can be to get their pets settled into the back of the car for a peaceful ride.

Getting them out at the end, on the other hand, is the easy part.

This was not the case for one Floridian woman, whose hard-headed drive-loving dog refused to budge once she parked her vehicle.

Crystal Felmly practically had to get down on all fours and beg her 3-year-old Belgian Malinois mix to 'get out of the car' after their journey home to Carrollwood in Tampa, Florida.

However, Tank proved just how far he was willing to go to press her buttons.

In the video, the furry monster can be seen jumping across the seats in a bid to stay put while Crystal grows increasingly frustrated.

At first she is amused by his cunning plan and instructs him gently: 'Tank let's go. Come on, we already went bye bye.'

But as the naughty boy sits wagging his tail playfully and ignores her pleas entirely, her tone takes a different turn.

Barking mad: Tank the dog drives his owner Crystal Felmy crazy by refusing to get out of the car  in Florida

'Come on get out. Tank, out of the car. Come on, let's go. Let's go, come on. Tank come on.'

He then decides to provoke her even further by jumping back and forth from seat to seat like a kangaroo, making it even harder for Crystal to exert her authority.

'Get out of the car! Oh you're a funny guy,' she  exclaims sarcastically before slamming the door and continuing to shout at him through the open window.

'Come on. Really? Really? You're not funny. It was funny for a minute now it's not. Get out of the car!'

MailOnline contacted Crystal - who adopted Tank for $45 when he was one year old - to find out what life is like dealing with such a mischievous pet.

'He understands what I'm saying!' Tank is clever than he looks and shows off his mischievous nature by pouncing from the back seat to the front of the car to stop Crystal from getting him out

'Tank  does this type of stuff a lot,' she admits. 'I really do think he understands what I'm saying sometimes.

'I'll ask him questions and he will respond by putting his paw on me or giving me kisses, or completely running away and trying to hide when I tell him it's time for a bath.'

Ironically, Crystal recalls that on the day she and her 12-year-old son Casey adopted the puppy they spent a good half an hour trying to get him into the car to bring him home.

He was too afraid and even hid under the bucket seats.

She says: 'Now, it's almost impossible to get him OUT of the car.'

However, despite Crystal's daily struggle, she confirms that Tank is 'an amazing dog and the canine love of my life. I can't imagine my life without him, we really lucked out'.
