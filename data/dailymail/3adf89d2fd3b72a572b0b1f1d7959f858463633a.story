The most-wanted man in New York City was held without bail yesterday after he turned himself in to police following a four-day manhunt over the hit and run deaths of a Brooklyn couple and their baby.

Julio Acevedo,
 44, was arrested outside a convenience store after approaching officers in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. He is being held on charges of leaving the scene of an accident, 
said Paul Browne,
 chief spokesman for the New York Police Department.

Police believe that Acevedo was behind the wheel of the speeding BMW that smashed into a cab carrying Raizy and Nathan Glauber, both 21, in Brooklyn on Sunday morning - killing both of them.

Raizy Glauber was seven months pregnant and the couple's child was delivered by cesarean section after the accident but tragically died the day after his parents.

Shame: Julio Acevedo was wanted by the New York City Police in connection with fleeing the scene of an accident which caused the death of expectant parents Nachman and Raizy Glauber and their premature child

Arrested: Julio Acevedo was arrested at a mini-mart in Bethlehem, Penn. at 5 pm on Wednesday

Julio Acevedo, 44, was taken into custody by the NYPD Fugitive Apprehension Team at the parking lot of a Turkey Hill store in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania

Julio Acevedo fled the scene on Sunday morning after hitting a cab carrying an expectant couple killing both of them - he was apprehended on Wednesday afternoon at a mini mart in Pennsylvania over 80 miles away

Acevedo, 44, used a friend, Derrick 
Hamilton, to act as a go-between with the police and arranged for 
detectives with the NYPD Fugitive Apprehension Team to pick him up at a 
Turkey Hill Mini Market in Bethlehem, Pennslyvania at 5.10 p.m.

Hamilton met officers at New York's Grand Central Station earlier in the day, then led them to Acevedo in Bethlehem, about 80 miles away, police said.

'He walked up to the car and got in,' a witness told the Daily News. 'No words or nothing.'

He will be extradited back to New York City 
and will be charged with felony offenses after going on the 
run immediately after the 12.30 a.m. crash in Williamsburg, New York on 
Sunday, where he left the couple to die.

Legal options open to prosecutors include charging him with manslaughter as well as leaving the scene of an accident.

According to the New York Post, Acevdeo was immediately taken to State Police Troop M barracks in Pennsylvania before as he waits to be taken back to New York City.

NYPD commissioner Ray Kelly said that police had been in contact with his friend, Derrick Hamilton ahead of his arrest.

'He said the individual wants to turn himself in, and he was going to do it he believed today with an attorney,' said Kelly, adding that cops weren’t sure if 'this is a game or what.'

Tragic: Nathan and Raizy Glauber, both 21, were on the way to hospital when they were killed in a hit-and-run car crash. Their son, who was delivered by emergency C section, has also died

Julio Acevedo, had eluded authorities since fleeing the crash but on Tuesday he vowed to turn himself in as he spoke out for the first time since the deaths.

'My
 heart goes out to them,' Acevedo said of the couple as he spoke to the New York Daily News over the phone. 'I didn't know they died until I saw the 
news.'

The suspect added 
that he had been fleeing from gunshots when his car smashed into the cab
 carrying the couple to hospital.

Nachman Glauber died instantly and Raizy Glauber and their unborn child 
were rushed to an emergency room. The mother died after delivering the 
baby boy via C-section.

The premature 7-month-old weighed only 4 pounds when delivered, but died from heart failure caused by low blood pressure on Monday.

Just two weeks before the deadly crash in Williamsburg, Acevedo was stopped by police for driving erratically and his blood alcohol level was far above the 
legal level at .13.

He told police he had drunk just two beers at a baby shower before he was pulled over. He was charged with a DWI but released the next day 
without bail.

Isaac Abraham, a spokesman for the 
family's Orthodox Jewish community, called Acevedo a 'coward' before his arrest and demanded he be charged with three murders.

Deadly: Acevedo was allegedly driving this BMW when it smashed into the taxi carrying the Glaubers

'We in the community are demanding that 
the prosecutor charge the driver of BMW that caused the death of this 
couple and infant ... with triple homicide,' Abraham said in a 
statement. 'This coward left the scene of the accident not even 
bothering to check on the people of the other car.'

Acevdeo is thought to have hit the Glauber's car at 60 mph and is believed to have rammed the vehicle with enough force that it knocked the car's engine into its backseat.

The Glaubers had been heading to 
hospital in a taxi early on Sunday morning after Raizy, who was seven 
months pregnant, felt an unusual pain.

Nachman and Raizy were traveling in the
 black 2008 Toyota Camry livery cab to Long Island College Hospital in 
Cobble Hill when a BMW smashed into the car and fatally injured the 
would-be parents.

The
 livery car, which the Glaubers had called as they did not have their 
own vehicle, was at a stop sign, but it was unclear if it had stopped, 
police said.

Scene: Police still do not know the cause of the crash but believe Acevedo was travelling at 60 mph

The taxi driver, Pedro Nunez Delacruz, 32, was not injured in the crash. He had an up-to-date license but an application to use the Toyota as a livery cab was still pending at the time of the crash.

This means it should not have been sent to collect them, according to the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission, but his union insisted he had done nothing wrong.

In New York City, yellow taxis are 
hailed on the street, but residents may call car services, and are 
picked up by drivers in everyday vehicles.

Meanwhile, police said the registered 
owner of the BMW, Takia Walker, 29 who was not in the car, was charged 
with insurance fraud on Sunday in a scam involving the car.

A
 person familiar with the investigation said Walker bought the car 
legally - or willingly used her identification for the purchase - then 
gave the car to another man. The middleman wasn't driving at the time of
 the accident, and had either lent or rented the car out to the driver, 
the person said.

A spokesman for the Orthodox Jewish community described the couple's death as 'a tragedy beyond (belief) just coming off a joyous holiday as Purim' as they were getting ready to welcome their first child

The impact from the t-bone smash sent
 Raizi out into the street where her body came to rest under a trailer, 
while first responders had to cut the roof off the taxi to rescue 
Nachman and the taxi driver.

Ellen Borakove, spokeswoman for the 
city medical examiner's office, said the baby's death was caused by 
extreme prematurity due to maternal blunt force injuries.

Tragically, in the initial aftermath of the accident, first responder Yisroel Altman 
said he initially believed both husband and wife could survive, but 
their head injuries ultimately were just too much.

Missed: A person walks towards the graves of Nathan and Raizy Glauber at the Satmar Cemetery. In keeping with the Jewish tradition of holding a burial as soon as possible, they were buried on Sunday

'I’ve
 seen worse cases [car accidents], it was the knock on the head that 
killed them,' said Altman to the New York Post, adding that Raizy was 
responsive in the ambulance until a few minutes before she arrived at 
Bellevue.

Jewish law calls for the burial of 
the dead as soon as possible and at least 1,000 people gathered at Yetev
 Lev D'Satmar synagogue in Brooklyn on Sunday to pay their respects to the 
Glaubers.

The sound of wailing filled the 
street as the two black-draped coffins were carried from a vehicle.

There will not be a similar funeral 
for the baby boy; Hasidim do not perform funerals for newborns who do 
not survive 30 days, according to Mendel Rosenberg, of Chesed Shel Emes.

Heartbroken: The Glaubers were mourned at an emotional funeral hours after their deaths on Sunday

Missed: The young Orthodox Jewish couple, both 21, both died of blunt force trauma from the crash

Mourning: Rabbi Zalman Teitelbau, leader of the Satmar Orthodox Jewish community, speaks during the funerals in Brooklyn on Sunday, surrounded by members of the community

The baby was placed in a tiny coffin 
and buried early on Monday afternoon in a separate area of the cemetery 
in Kiryas Joel where his parents were laid to rest Sunday.

At the funeral on Sunday Rabbi Zalman Leib Teitelbaum addressed the mourners in Yiddish.

'It's
 a great tragedy for the community,' said Teitelbaum. 'We have to hold 
on together and see what we can do to make things better. This is a 
very, very big tragedy.'

Raizi's brother, Yitzchak Silberstein, spoke of his devastation at his sister's tragic passing to the New York Daily News.

'She was the crown of the family,' said Silberstein. 'We were sitting together last night and today she’s gone.'

The young couple were in this livery cab when they were involved in the crash

He
 was full of praise for his brother-in-law too. 'We can all learn from 
him how to treat a wife,' he said. 'The way he treated her was special.'

The funerals took place in Brooklyn, which is home to the largest 
community of ultra-orthodox Jews outside Israel, more than 250,000.

The Glaubers were married about a 
year ago and had begun a life together in Williamsburg, where Raizi 
Glauber grew up in a prominent Orthodox Jewish rabbinical family, Sara 
Glauber said.

Raised north of New York City in 
Monsey, N.Y., and part of a family that founded a line of clothing for 
Orthodox Jews, Nachman Glauber was studying at a rabbinical college 
nearby, said his cousin.
