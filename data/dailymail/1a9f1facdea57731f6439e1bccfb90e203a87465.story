The Madeira Islands Open has been rescheduled for the end of July after last week's event was postponed due to extreme weather.

The European Tour on Tuesday confirmed the tournament would tee off again on July 30 until August 2. 

Sunday's postponement came after just one round had been played at the Santo da Serra, with strong winds, dense fog and heavy rain making play impossible.

Strong winds, dense fog and heavy rain forced the tournament to be cancelled by officials on Sunday

Keith Waters, chief operating officer of the European Tour said in a statement: 'Given the importance of the Madeira Islands Open and our close working relationship with the golf club and sponsors, we were very keen to reschedule the tournament and the fact that we have managed to do so this quickly is testament to the desire and commitment of all parties to reach an agreement.'

Prior to the cancellation, Denmark's JB Hansen had held the clubhouse lead on four under par, one shot ahead of a group of eight players which included England's Andrew Marshall and Scotland's Peter Whiteford, with the entire field separated by just six shots.

Officials and greenkeepers tried their best to prepare the course for play but the conditions prevailed
