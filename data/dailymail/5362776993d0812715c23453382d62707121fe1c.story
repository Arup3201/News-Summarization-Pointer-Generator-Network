Part two of Sportsmail's Transfer Column sees Arsenal and Everton scouts looking at Sheffield United's teenage striker Diego de Girolamo, Fulham hoping to beat the likes of Tottenham and Liverpool to Argentine Luciano Viatto, and Blackpool seeking to soften the blow of losing Tom Ince by charging a loan fee.

Arsenal and Everton scouts were at Crewe Alexandra Park training ground on Monday to watch Diego de Girolamo play for Sheffield United U21s against Crewe.

The 18-year-old striker was an unused substitute in Sunday's FA Cup tie with Fulham.

The Italy U18 forward is being watched closely following his return from cruciate ligament damage.

Fulham have been asking about various strikers around Germany for this window. Kaiserslautern's Simon Zoller, plus Kevin Wimmer and Yannick Gerhardt at Cologne, have all been discussed.

However, one that they would like to sign for the summer should they stay up is Luciano Vietto.The 20-year-old Argentine is causing a stir at Racing Club where he was brought through by former coach Diego Simeone and is looked after by Diego Maradona's former agent Jorge Cyterszpiler.

Atletico Madrid, Liverpool, Manchester City and Real Madrid have all been to watch him since but Fulham hope they can lure him with the prospect of regular football and London. Vietto has a dual Italian passport but competition could yet come from Tottenham.

Although they are keen to find British, Tottenham do not want to skimp on quality. Franco Baldini may work on a deal for Juventus striker Mirko Vucinic for this window but Vietto is one with an eye for the future.

Blackpool will look to gain a loan fee for Tom Ince as talks continue. The Championship club were expecting to miss out financially with Ince closing on a summer agreement with Monaco that would give them as little as £155,000 compensation on a player valued at £8million.

A loan fee of around £250,000 or more could add some financial consolation to an eventful tale. Crystal Palace's interest on Monday, added to that from Swansea City, Stoke City, Hull City and Sunderland, may see that fee rise.

Refusal: Tom Ince told Blackpool he was 'not in the right frame of mind' to play following his father's sacking

Ince, who is out of contract in the summer, told caretaker manager Barry Ferguson he was not in the right frame of mind to play against Doncaster on Saturday after his father Paul was sacked last week.

The 21-year-old had trained as normal but changed his mind on Saturday morning and didn’t arrive at Bloomfield Road until 30 minutes before kick-off, an hour after the rest of the players had reported in.

Ferguson told reporters: 'He wasn’t in the right frame of mind. I can understand his reasons. I asked him the question and he was honest enough to give me a call. It’s been a difficult week for Tom.'

Prolific: In demand Lee Gregory has scored 18 goals in 23 games for Halifax this season

A host of Championship club scouts were on hand again on Saturday as Halifax goal machine Lee Gregory rattled in another two against Aldershot.

The 26-year-old has 18 goals in 23 games this season and has been the subject of a failed offer from Bradford. Scouts from Bolton, Barnsley and Blackburn have been watching closely a player that has been likened to Leicester's Jamie Vardy.

On hold: West Ham could return for Leeds' Ross McCormack once they have sold players

Leeds' prospective Italian owners were getting a tour of the Thorp Arch training ground yesterday as Massimo Cellino and his consortium looked to push through their deal for the club.

West Ham have shelved a bid for Ross McCormack for now but could revisit later in the week should they sell players themselves. It all adds to unwanted distraction for manager Brian McDermott who is understood to be increasingly frustrated by the off pitch activities.

Even today another group, led by ex-Manchester United commercial director Mike Farnan, were being linked with making a rival offer to that of Cellino and the existing Sport Capital one.
