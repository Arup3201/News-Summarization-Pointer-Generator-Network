She may be fast approaching her 40th birthday but Kate Moss's domination of the fast-paced fashion world shows no sign of abating.

And to celebrate a staggering 20 years since her first appearance on the cover of iconic i-D magazine, the Croydon-born model is the gracing the glossy cover of not one but all four of their pre-spring 2013 issues.

The 39-year-old can be seen in a variety of poses for each of the four covers. In one she sports a natural look with loosely plaited hair and bohemian jewellery and in another she is wearing nothing more than a pink bow to conceal her modesty.
