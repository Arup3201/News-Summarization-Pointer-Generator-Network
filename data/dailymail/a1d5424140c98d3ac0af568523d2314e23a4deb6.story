Who remembers Robert Pires' failed attempt to pass the ball to Thierry Henry in their infamous penalty cock-up?

Well, Korean outfit Jeonbuk Motors have shown the Arsenal legends how it should be done.

The Jeonbuk Motors beat Pohang Steelers thanks to the successful spot-kick routine which was scored by Kaio after usual penalty taker Leonardo flicked the ball to him from the spot - a move which was unsuccessfully attempted by Pires and Henry.

Pires and Henry's blushes were spared as Arsenal managed to win the Premier League encounter

The French pair's attempt is one of the biggest blunders in the Premier League as Pires mishit his pass to Henry and conceded a free-kick in the process.

The duo avoided a public dressing down from manager Arsene Wenger as Arsenal managed to hold on to their 1-0 lead against Manchester City back in October 2005.

Wenger said after the match that Pires, who had already scored a penalty to notch Arsenal's 500th Premier League goal at Highbury, 'made a big mistake and a wrong decision' but was not 'lacking seriousness or respect'.

The South Koreans, fortunately for them, got it right.
