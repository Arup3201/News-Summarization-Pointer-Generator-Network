People in Britain must stop flushing their toilets so often, the EU has declared.

Brussels wants to impose a new bog standard flush across the continent to reduce water use after splashing out £72,000 on a study into toilet habits in 26 countries.

The bizarre edict on cistern size from Eurocrats suggests David Cameron’s hopes of cutting unnecessary regulations has gone down the pan.

Panned: The European Commission spent £76,000 on a study looking at how much water different countries using flushing the toilets

Already dubbed the ‘euroflush’, Brussels wants to standardise toilet flushes across the EU. It wants toilets to be limited to five litres and urinals one litre.

A ‘half-flush’ will be allowed three litres, according to a draft of the policy.

Cisterns in the UK can contain up to six litres of water, but older toilets could be even bigger.

The European Commission launched a detailed study, costing £72,000 into the toilet habits of the continent.

Urinals would be banned from using more than one litre of water, under EU plans

It found that people in the UK flush the
 most, using 1,125 million cubic metres of water in home toilets in 
2010, followed by Italy (1,074) and Germany (1,021), The Times reported.

Across the EU a quarter of all domestic water use was used by toilets, but in Britain the figure was higher at 30 per cent – beaten only by 33 per cent in Luxembourg.

By comparison people Finland flushed the least, at 14 per cent of all household water usage.

A 122-page report on toilet flushing was produced by the Commission, which concluded: ‘Two key elements appear to affect the water consumption of flushing toilets and urinals: their design and the user behaviour.

‘User behaviour is a crucial aspect and must be without any doubts emphasised.

‘The user behaviour analysis carried out showed how the average water consumption differs among the EU member states. Also the consumption between citizens of one country may vary very significantly.’

Paul Nuttall, deputy leader of the UK Independence Party, said it was a 'preposterous waster of money'.

He added: 'They admit in their report that there are significant cultural differences in latrine etiquette.

'The bottom line is they are talking about red-tape all the time but instead we are spending two and a half years on a 60-page report to tray and harmonise loo behaviour amongst the peoples of Europe

'Surely what goes on behind the bathroom door should be left to the people who are behind it. It is money down the pan.'

Regulations: The revelation comes after David Cameron struck a deal with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso to cut Brussels red-tape

The report also found that Britain has 45.3 million private and public toilets, the fourth highest number in the EU.

Germany
 has the most at 77 million, followed by Spain (49.2 million) and Italy 
(46.5 million). Italy has the most urinals in Europe - 8.2 million.

All this work will be used as part of EU plans to impose an ’Eco-label’ on goods sold across the continent.

But
 this rush to create more regulations appears at odds with Mr Cameron’s 
insistence that EU red-tape is ‘throttling’ British business.

Last week he struck a deal with José Manuel Barroso, the European Commission President, that Brussels move to reduce bureaucratic recommendations.

An EU spokesman said: ‘We will propose next week criteria under which member states can award Ecolabel status to products, in this case toilets and urinals.

'Eco-label criteria help consumers, businesses, local authorities etc, who want to buy green products, know which product to choose.’
