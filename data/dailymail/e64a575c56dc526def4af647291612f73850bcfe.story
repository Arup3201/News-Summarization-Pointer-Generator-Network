A new study has shown persistent noise may hinder the development of young children by interfering with the growth of blood vessels in the brain. File picture

It may be all too tempting to put a baby in front of the television or play music to soothe them - but scientists fear it might be doing them permanent damage.

Repetitive, persistent noise may have a long-term impact on the development of a child’s brain, new research suggests.

Scientists warn that even relatively low sound - such as a television turned on quiet or the background noise of a washing machine - may cause harm if it is left on for more than a few hours.

They think it could alter the development of babies and toddlers under the age of two, creating potential problems in later life.

Neurologist Dr Jaime Grutzendler said persistent noise of more than ten hours a day may stop blood vessels being formed in babies’ brains.

Long-term impacts could include an increased susceptibility to diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure and accelerated ageing.

Researchers at Yale University played low noise to young mice for ten hours a day, for a period of ten days.

They found that the stimulation reduced the number of blood vessels being formed by 10 to 15 per cent, significantly reducing the oxygen that could reach the brain.

Dr Grutzendler said: ‘The most striking relevance of this paper is that humans in a modern society are exposed to sounds that are quite similar to the ones that we played to the mice.

‘There are children that are exposed to this kind of constant noise through environmental noise and persistent music.’

Recordings played to the mice included a random assortment of sounds, including static ‘white noise’ and mouse noises.

The sounds were played at 40 to 60 decibels - the volume of normal conversation, a vacuum cleaner or a quiet television.

Dr Grutzendler said: ‘They sounds were not very loud but very persistent.

‘It was not enough to cause any ear damage - babies are probably exposed to much louder volumes.

‘And it had a very, very dramatic effect on the formation of new blood vessels.

‘The interesting part is that the effect only occurs if you stimulate the mice at a particular age - before one month after birth, which is the equivalent of a one-to-two-year-old human.’ He added: ‘These repetitive sounds didn’t really exist 100 years, 200 years ago. But in modern society we are exposing kids to these repetitive sounds.

‘They are continually exposed to environmental noises, music, video games, television.’

The study, published in Nature, also found that putting a mouse on a treadmill for several hours or repeatedly stimulating their whiskers had the same effect on blood vessel growth.

Dr Grutzendler said: ‘The results indicate that there is a general principal that too much stimulation of the nervous system by this repetitive stimulation causes an implication for the formation of blood vessels.

‘Mild stimulation - what you would call normal or healthy stimulation - does not cause any effect on blood vessels.

‘But what is not perfectly fine is to have these repetitive noises which are persistent. That is a stressful situation for the brain when it is vulnerable because it is developing these new connections and new blood vessels.’

He said more research is needed to firmly establish whether the findings were applicable in humans, but he added: ‘This is a public health issue which we think should be taken seriously.’
