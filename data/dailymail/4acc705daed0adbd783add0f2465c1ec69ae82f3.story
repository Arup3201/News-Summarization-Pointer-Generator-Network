Alex Salmond quit last night after having failed to realise his lifetime ambition of Scottish independence.

The First Minister, who days ago looked on the cusp of victory, said it was time to hand over to a new leader after the nationalists were defeated.

Looking downcast during a press conference at his official residence, Bute House in Edinburgh, Mr Salmond said he was proud of the high turnout and a ‘remarkable’ result.

Mr Salmond said: 'Let us not dwell on the distance we have fallen short... but on the distance we have travelled'

‘My time as leader is nearly over,’ he announced, ‘but for Scotland the campaign continues and the dream shall never die.’

He admitted a referendum could happen only ‘once in a generation’ but told the Scottish people they had the chance to ‘hold Westminster’s feet to the fire’ to deliver the powers they had been promised in return for staying in the Union.

He made a final swipe at the Westminster parties, claiming they were reneging on their devolution promises already.

He accused David Cameron of rowing back on Gordon Brown’s pledge to allow a vote on a draft Bill enshrining new powers for Holyrood before next May’s General Election.

It is expected that Nicola Sturgeon, Mr Salmond’s close ally and loyal deputy for seven years, will succeed him in a leadership contest at the Scottish National Party conference in November.

Miss Sturgeon, a 44-year-old former solicitor who performed impressively during the referendum campaign, said last night she would make no official announcement but seemed to throw her hat into the ring, saying she could ‘think of no greater privilege than to seek to lead the party I joined when I was just 16’.

Mr Salmond, 59, who intends to remain a member of the Scottish parliament, drove his party from a fringe movement to the heart of government in 20 years at the helm

She added: ‘Alex Salmond’s achievements as SNP leader and Scotland’s First Minister are second to none...he inspired 1.6million of our fellow citizens to vote Yes to independence.’

Mr Salmond had appeared briefly at 6am yesterday to concede defeat, telling the nationalists they had driven fear into the Westminster establishment.

He called on his supporters to accept the result and said: ‘Let us not dwell on the distance we have fallen short; let us dwell on the distance we have travelled.’

When he finally surfaced to answer questions about the defeat, Alex Salmond handpicked the journalists allowed to attend – with unionist Press turned away.

His press conference, at which he announced his resignation, had been due to start at 10am but at midday officials announced it would be ‘invitation only’.

The Times, The Sun in Scotland, the Herald, Dundee Courier, Daily Record, PA, BBC and Sky were invited while the Mail, Financial Times, Telegraph and Express were barred and The Guardian boycotted the event. 

‘I believe this is a new and exciting situation which is redolent with possibility,’ he said. ‘But in that situation I believe party, Parliament and country would benefit from new leadership. It has been the privilege of my life to serve as First Minister...we lost the referendum vote, but Scotland can still carry the political initiative. Scotland can still emerge as the real winner.’

At a press conference from which No supporting newspapers – including the Mail – were excluded, he said it was for others to take the independence cause forward.

As he spoke, his chief of staff Geoff Aberdein was in tears.

Mr Salmond, Scotland’s longest-serving First Minister, grew up on a council estate in the Labour stronghold of Linlithgow, West Lothian. A committed socialist, he joined the SNP as a student in the early 1970s in frustration at Labour’s support for the Union.

After a stint at the civil service – where he met his wife Moira – he landed a job as an economist.

He stuck with the SNP as it lost nine of its 11 MPs following a wipeout in the home rule referendum of 1979 and dragged the party into a more moderate direction, becoming an MP in 1987 and party leader three years later. He became First Minister in 2007, leading a minority government, then trounced Labour in the 2011 Holyrood elections.

Mr Cameron said Mr Salmond was ‘a politician of huge talent and passion’ and an effective First Minister adding: ‘While we disagree profoundly about his goal of a separated Scotland, and many other things, I respect and admire his huge contribution to politics.’

Ed Miliband said Mr Salmond was a ‘formidable politician...who stood up for what he believed in’.
