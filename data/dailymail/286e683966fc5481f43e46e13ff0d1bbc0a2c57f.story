The Foreign Office has warned against travel to various parts of Turkey except in cases of emergency following another day of rioting.

Tens of thousands took to the streets in the country’s four biggest cities yesterday – the third day of anti-government protests – with demonstrators clashing with riot police, who repelled them with tear gas.

The unrest initially erupted on Friday when trees were torn down at a park in Istanbul’s main Taksim Square under government plans to redevelop the area. But they have widened into a broad show of defiance against the Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party (AKP).

Prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan blamed the main secular opposition party for inciting the crowds, and said the protests were aimed at depriving his ruling AK Party of votes as elections begin next year.

Erdogan said the plans to remake the square, long an iconic rallying point for mass demonstrations, would go ahead, including the construction of a new mosque and the rebuilding of a replica Ottoman-era barracks.

And he said the protests – which were started by a small group of environmental campaigners but mushroomed when police used force to eject them from the park on Taksim Square – had nothing to do with the plans.

‘It’s entirely ideological,’ he told 
Turkish television. The demonstrations have since drawn in a wide range 
of people of all ages from across the political and social spectrum.

Protests yesterday were not as 
violent as the previous two days but police used tear gas to try to 
disperse hundreds of people in Ankara’s main Kizilay Square. There were 
similar clashes in Izmir and Adana, Turkey’s third and fourth-biggest 
cities.

In Taksim Square, the atmosphere was 
more festive with some chanting for Erdogan to resign and others singing
 and dancing. There were later clashes between police and protesters 
near Erdogan’s office in a former Ottoman palace in the city.

The main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) denied orchestrating the unrest.

‘Today the people on the street 
across Turkey are not exclusively from the CHP, but from all ideologies 
and from all parties,’ senior party member Mehmet Akif Hamzacebi said.

Some 2.5 million Britons visit Turkey each year and it is an increasingly popular destination for holidaymakers from the UK.

The Foreign Office has also warned Britons to avoid travelling to areas close to the Syrian border.

Turkish Interior Minister Muammer Guler yesterday said more than 1,700 people had been arrested in anti-government protests that have spread to 67 cities nationwide, though most have since been released.

'A large majority of the detainees were released after being questioned and identified,' he said in remarks carried by the state-run Anatolia news agency. He added that the country had seen 235 demonstrations since Tuesday.Meanwhile Britons are being urged to avoid trips to Turkey until the ongoing riots have dissipated. 

The
 Foreign Office said on its website: ‘Demonstrations are taking place in
 Istanbul and in other cities across Turkey, including Ankara.

‘Police are using tear gas and water cannon in response. We advise British nationals to avoid all demonstrations.’

Police used tear gas on protesters in 
Ankara but the clashes so far today were relatively minor compared with major 
violence in Turkey's biggest cities on the previous two days.

Meanwhile
 Turkey's Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan accused the main secular 
opposition party of provoking the wave of anti-government protests.

Calling the protesters 'a few looters', Erdogan said he would press ahead with redeveloping Istanbul's Taksim Square, a project which provoked the demonstrations that have widened into a broader show of defiance against his Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party (AKP).

Erdogan singled out the Republican People's Party (CHP) - set up in 1924 by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk who founded Turkey's modern secular state - for attack over a dispute he described as ideological.

'We think that the main opposition party which is making resistance calls on every street is provoking these protests,' Erdogan said on Turkish television.

Turkey's fiercest anti-government unrest for years erupted when trees were torn down at a park in Taksim Square under government plans to construct a new mosque and rebuild a replica Ottoman-era barracks.

'This reaction is no longer about the 
ripping out 12 trees. This is based on ideology,' said Erdogan, whose 
conservative vision for the nation has angered more liberal Turks. 
Referring to the planned mosque, he added: 'Obviously I will not ask for
 permission for this from the head of CHP or a few looters.'

Tens of thousands gathered on Sunday 
after a calmer night in Taksim Square, which saw two days of clashes 
between protesters and riot police backed by armoured vehicles and 
helicopters.

The atmosphere was more festive with 
some chanting for Erdogan to resign and others singing and dancing. 
There was little obvious police presence.

In Ankara's downtown Kizilay district,
 however, police used tear gas after a few thousand people chanted 
anti-government slogans and blocked traffic.

On Sunday rain appeared to keep the 
crowds away from Taksim Square initially, but this did not dampen the 
spirit of the protesters whose numbers later swelled.

'We will stay until the end,' said 
Akin, who works in motor trade and has been in Taksim for the past four 
days. 'We are not leaving. The only answer now is for this government to
 fall. We are tired of this oppressive government constantly putting 
pressure on us.'

There were more than 90 separate 
demonstrations around the country on Friday and Saturday, officials 
said. More than 1,000 people have been injured in Istanbul and several 
hundred more in Ankara, according to medical staff.

The ferocity of the police response in
 Istanbul shocked Turks, as well as tourists caught up in the unrest in 
one of the world's most visited destinations. It has drawn rebukes from 
the United States, European Union and international rights groups.

Helicopters fired tear gas canisters 
into residential neighbourhoods and police used teargas to try to smoke 
people out of buildings. Footage on YouTube showed one protester being 
hit by an armoured police truck as it charged a barricade.

Erdogan has overseen a transformation 
in Turkey during his decade in power, turning its once crisis-prone 
economy into the fastest-growing in Europe.

On Sunday, he addressed critics who called him a 'dictator'.

'We have carried Turkey into a new 
era... If they call someone who is a servant of his country, then I have
 nothing to say to them,' he said.

Among Turks in general Erdogan remains
 by far the most popular politician, but critics point to what they see 
as his authoritarianism and religiously conservative meddling in private
 lives in the secular republic.

Tighter restrictions on alcohol sales 
and warnings against public displays of affection in recent weeks have 
also provoked protests. Concern that government policy is allowing 
Turkey to be dragged into the conflict in neighbouring Syria by the West
 has also led to peaceful demonstrations.
