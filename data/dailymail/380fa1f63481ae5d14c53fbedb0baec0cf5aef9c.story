The BBC’s best-paid presenters are in revolt against plans to axe their tax-saving freelance contracts.

The corporation had promised the Government it would stop paying staff through ‘personal service companies’ that can attract a lower rate of tax.

But it may be forced to back down in the face of mounting anger from stars on the deals.

Star names: It is understood presenters including Fiona Bruce (left) and Emily Maitlis (right) are among those who use personal service companies, which attract a lower rate of tax

Jeremy Paxman, Fiona Bruce and Emily Maitlis are all paid in this way.

Those
 whose freelance contracts are close to expiry have been asked to end 
their off-payroll arrangements to avoid suspicion of tax avoidance. But 
by signing on as a staff member – and qualifying for a BBC pension and 
other benefits – they would have to accept pay cuts of up to 25 per 
cent.

Instead of caving in 
to the demands, many have refused to sign staff contracts, leaving the 
BBC to consider either firing some of its biggest names or to accept 
defeat.

An insider to the 
negotiations described the situation as chaos, adding: ‘The BBC is in an
 impossible position. Its own staff have it over a barrel.

‘It
 has promised to change the way it pays its people, but is powerless to 
do anything because they would rather leave than give in and they are 
all acting as one. The bottom line is the BBC can’t afford to lose its 
top people.’ The  personal service company arrangements have been 
branded ‘staggeringly inappropriate’ by the Commons public accounts 
committee, which suggested the BBC could be complicit in tax avoidance.

The
 rate of corporation tax – which companies pay on profits – is up to 20 
per cent lower than the income tax that high-earning individuals face.

Top names: Jeremy Paxman (left) channels his earnings through a company whose most recent accounts showed it had £218,000 in the bank. Sarah Montague (right), a presenter on Radio 4’s Today programme, disclosed she paid herself £165,000 through her personal service company in the past financial year

 Last
 night, Tory MP Stewart Jackson, who sits on the public accounts 
committee, said the failure of the BBC to resolve its pay arrangements 
was extremely disappointing: ‘It shows the weakness of the senior 
management of the BBC that undertakings of openness and transparency 
have come to nothing.’

More 
than 6,000 BBC freelancers are paid through personal service companies, 
allowing them to be taxed as companies rather than individuals.

Mr
 Paxman, who hosts the flagship BBC2 show Newsnight, channels his 
earnings through a company called Out In The Dark Ltd. Its most recent 
accounts showed it had £218,000 in the bank.

His
 freelance contract has not yet come up for renewal, meaning he has not 
yet been forced to consider whether he will sign a staff contract.

Sarah
 Montague, a presenter on Radio 4’s Today programme, disclosed she paid 
herself £165,000 through her personal service company in the past year. 
The sums may include fees from outside engagements such as speaking 
events.

There is no suggestion any of the individuals on the contracts have acted improperly or deliberately sought to avoid tax.

Mr Paxman claimed in 2012 that the BBC had ordered him to form a company if he wanted to continue to present Newsnight.

BBC: Broadcasting House is already in a battle with stars over plans to axe tax-saving freelance contracts

One
 of the few presenters to sign a staff contract is Today presenter John 
Humphrys, who agreed to come on to the books last year.

Sue
 Ayton, a talent agent whose BBC clients include Michael Buerk, Samira 
Ahmed and Moira Stewart, said: ‘In my opinion the BBC – with its huge 
internal resources – has got into a real mess on this one and after 
spending a great deal of time and money trying to resolve it has only 
created more confusion and frustration.’

A
 BBC spokesman said last night: ‘From November last year the BBC has 
been applying a new employment test to all on-air television presenters.
 If the result of that test shows employment, talent have been offered 
on-air talent employment contracts.

‘There is no truth in claims that television presenters are refusing to move to staff roles.’
