A billionaire hedge fund manager has accused his former fiancée of crying poor while living in the lap of luxury.

British socialite Annabelle Bond is in the throes of a legal battle with Warren Lichtenstein, who says Bond, 44, 'lavishes herself with fur coats and horses.'

Bond and Lichtenstein broke off their engagement in 2007 when Bond was five months pregnant with Lichtenstein's child, and since then have waged a bitter battle across several continents.

Bond is now attempting to compel U.S. courts to enforce a judgement made in Hong Kong which awarded her $570,000 in child support for six-year-old Isabella, plus legal costs, reports the Telegraph.

Lichtenstein, seeking to prevent the ruling being enforced, filed an affidavit in the New York Supreme Court pointing out that Bond is the daughter of a billionaire Sir John Bond, former chairman of HSBC bank and Vodafone, and dating a millionaire, Andrew Cader.

'At the same time that she is crying poverty in this case, she nonetheless lives in the most expensive section of Hong Kong, has two full-time maids and is driven about in a chauffeur-driven Range Rover,' reads the affidavit.

She is also an avid traveler, according to the document, and globe-trots for a large part of each year.

According to Stanley Arkin, Lichtenstein’s lawyer, Bond has already been to Los Angeles and Aspen, Colorado, twice this year, as well as to Austria, Japan, Malaysia and St. Barts.

She also lives rent-free with Cader, who 'owns an equestrian estate in New York, a mansion in St. Barts, a home in Aspen, a sailing yacht, a 15,000-bottle wine collection and a private jet.'

And Arkin also pooh-poohed the 'incredible assertion that Sir John — one of the richest men in the world — could not afford to continue making £2,000 per month allowance payments to [his daughter] due to his pending retirement,' reports Page Six.

According to the Telegraph, Annabelle Bond has been distressed at the portrayal of her by Lichtenstein as a 'frivolous jetsetter.'

She was awarded an OBE in 2006 for her services to mountaineering and charity. She has climbed Mount Everest and became the fastest woman to ascend the Seven Summits (the world's seven greatest mountain peaks) in 360 days.

Lichtenstein told the court that he has paid significant amounts of money for his daughter's upkeep, someimes exceeding $20,000 per month, and that Bond lives a life of privilege and should contribute her 'fair share' towards the support of her daughter.

Bond's attorney, Seth Lapidow, said the decision about how much money Lichtenstein owes for child support is a decision for the court to make.

'All Ms. Bond is trying to do is get him to satisfy the judgment of that court – which he steadfastly refuses to do. The papers are nothing more than a callous attack on a mother simply trying to do the best for her child.'
