The former executive director of JBWere has claimed she was sexually harassed and intimidated into leaving her position after falling pregnant.

Toni Thornton from Queensland has claimed $4.5 million dollars from the company in compensation for the harassment.

Federal court documents reveal that when Ms Thornton notified her supervisor at the time, Paul Heath, that she was pregnant in February of 2009 he said that: 'in his experience a woman's IQ halves when she falls pregnant'.

Three months later, Ms Thornton claims Mr Heath instructed her to turn around before saying: 'Yup, you are having a boy because your bum has blown out'.

Mr Heath went on to become the chief executive of JBWere but was made redundant after the company was bought by National Australia Bank, according to Fairfax. His attempt to sue the company for a payout was dismissed by the Fair Work Commission when he was found to overvalue his own abilities.

The mother-of-two said in her statement of claim that she was penalised for taking time off of work and choosing to work part time after her pregnancies by being given higher targets than her colleagues but receiving smaller bonuses.

After returning to work following her first pregnancy in 2010, she was only given a $20,000 bonus which was then again reduced by 20 per cent due to her working less hours, despite being given up to $150,000 in previous years.

When informing her colleague Steve Marino that she planned to take maternity leave again after falling pregnant with a second child, she alleges that he told her he was 'pissed off, frustrated' and said he 'no longer wished to share clients'.

Staff at human resources instructed her to ignore the incident, Ms Thornton claimed.

However, when she again resumed her position at JBWere in July 2013 following her second round of maternity leave, she claims her client base had been slashed by 33 per cent and she was constantly asked by staff: 'do you really want to come back to work?'

A NAB spokesperson on Thornton Case told Daily Mail Australia: 'We do not comment on matters before the courts. However we deny these allegations and will vigorously defend the case'.  

The case will continue in November.
