Desperate search: Sarah Majoras, 39, has not been seen since leaving a Pennsylvania nightclub at 2am on Saturday

A woman has disappeared after walking home alone from a nightclub in the early hours of Saturday, close to an ice-covered canal.

Sarah Majoras was last seen at 2am leaving John & Peter's club in New Hope, Pennsylvania.

The 39-year-old has worked at the club for 15 years. However she was not working on Friday night but had been drinking
 and listening to music with friends.

Her boyfriend Adam Baker called 
the bar when she did not return home.

She was reported missing at around 2pm on Saturday by Mr Baker, according to the Hunterdon County Democrat.

Lambertville Police requested that divers search particular areas of the canal on Sunday. Rescue efforts will continue today.

Dive teams cut holes in the frozen D&R Canal until the search was called off as darkness fell.

Police believe that the woman would have been walking to her home in Lambertville when she disappeared, said Hunterdon County Prosecutor Anthony P. Kearns III.

The roughly ten-minute walk involves crossing a toll-free bridge over the canal.

Police were in the process of 
examining surveillance cameras from the bridge and a home on the far-end for further clues as to what happened to 
the 39-year-old.

A police helicopter has been assisting in the search and making low swoops over the canal.
