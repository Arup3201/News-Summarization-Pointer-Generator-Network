Usain Bolt put claims of him calling the Commonwealth Games 'a bit s***' to one side on Wednesday morning, taking time out in Glasgow to watch Jamaica in the netball.

The six-time Olympic champion, who competes in the 4x100m relay later this week, tweeted earlier in the day to deny the claims but didn't looked too troubled by them as he cheered his nation on.

Bolt was reported in The Times to have made the remark outside the athletes' village on Tuesday, also replying 'not really' when asked if he was having fun in Glasgow.

Bolt made a low-key appearance midway through the second quarter of the women's netball match between Jamaica and New Zealand at the SECC.

Taking up a regular seat towards the back of the VIP section, the crowd did appear immediately aware of his presence as he sat quietly chewing gum and clapping his team.

As Bolt made his way out of the Netball hall, with media shouting questions at him regarding his opinion of the Games, he shouted 'awesome' in response before security ensured a swift exit.
