He discovered a passion for flying somewhat late in life. But Harrison Ford embraced it with gusto and claimed to fly his planes as much as he drove his vintage cars.

The actor was 52 when he first seriously started flying lessons and over the years the Indiana Jones star has amassed an impressive aviation collection.

The experienced and respected pilot keeps the aircraft at the Santa Monica Airport - which is where he was where he had taken off from in his two-seater PT- 22 shortly before he crashed on a nearby Venice golf course on Thursday.

Current fave: Harrison Ford has been seen several times lately flying his silver and yellow PT-22 two-seater vintage plane in and out of Santa Monica Airport. He was last photographed taking off in the aircraft last Friday

A real-life action man: Ford, 72, once said that learning to fly gave him freedom and pleasure and he's survived a number of crashes over the years

The Ryan PT-22 Recruit with its silver metallic body and eye-catching yellow trim was built in 1942 and was primarily designed as a trainer for the U.S. Army Air Corps.

Ford was regularly seen flying it in and out of Santa Monica Airport and was last photographed in it just a week ago on Friday February 27.

In an interview with The Mail On Sunday back in 2010, the Blade Runner and Star Wars actor talked about some of the planes in his collection and the reasons he loves flying so much.

'Flying is like good music: it elevates the spirit and it's an exhilarating freedom.' he said. 'It's not a thrill thing or an adrenaline rush; it's engaging in a process that takes focus and commitment. 

Aviator: The 72-year-old actor keeps his collection of planes at Santa Monica Airport and routinely flies himself to and from his ranch in Wyoming

Ford, 72, has a long range jet, a Citation Sovereign,  a turboprop aircraft capable of operating on unimproved airstrips; and a de Havilland DHC-2 Beaver single engine bush plane.

He also has a 1929 Waco Taperwing open-top biplane, an Aviat Husky, which is a two-seat fabric-covered bush plane, and a Bell 407 helicopter.

In 1999, Ford was flying his helicopter along the Lake Piru riverbed, north-east of Los Angeles, when it went down in a hard landing during a routine training session.  

'All of my planes are great to fly, and that's why I've got so many of them': The Indiana Jones star's collection includes an Aviat Husky, a Canadian de Havilland Beaver and several Cessnas as well as a 1929 open-top bi-plane and a Bell helicopter

After landing hard the aircraft  began skidding forward in the loose gravel before one of its skids struck a partially embedded log and flipped onto its side

Neither the actor nor his instructor were hurt although the helicopter was severely damaged.

He later joked the incident gave him the opportunity to buy a new helicopter. 

The family that flies together.....: The star often uses his private jet to fly his wife, actress Calista Flockhart and their son Liam from place to place

Ford once described crashing a plane as being like scraping a bumper and said he used his planes as much he used his cars.

'I'm so passionate about flying, I often fly up the coast for a cheeseburger,' he said in 2010.

The Hollywood star often flies to and from his  ranch in Wyoming and has used his helicopter there to aid Search and Rescue crews locate missing hikers.

It's not a Millenium Falcon but the Han Solo actor still loves flying his own planes and is happy to do it all, even carrying his own bags on and off the aircraft

Ford has twice assisted local search and rescue teams with his helicopter, including one instance in which he picked up a hiker who became dehydrated. 

He donated his flying skills to non-profit organizations, including Operation Smile and the Special Olympics, and flew medical personnel and supplies to Haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake.

The father-of-five has played leading roles in at least two rescues, helping evacuate a missing hiker and a Boy Scout on separate occasions in 2001.

Up in the air: Ford who just confirmed he plans to make a sequel to the 1982 cult classic Bladerunner, is a veteran pilot with 20 years experience

With his need for speed, Ford collects vintage cars and motorbikes, 

He has about a dozen motorcycles including several BMWs, a couple of Harleys, Hondas and a Triumph.

He has vintage cars too including a rare 1955 forest green convertible  Jaguar XK 140 worth about $150,000.

Ford is married to actress Calista Flockhart and they have a teenage son Liam. 

Not just planes: Ford also has an extensive motorcycle collection as well as some vintage cars
