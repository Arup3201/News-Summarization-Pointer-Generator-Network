As six bodies were removed from the Java Sea following the crash of AirAsia flight 8501, the first details of those who died on board the doomed aircraft have started to emerge.

The Airbus 320 had 162 people on board - 138 adult passengers, 16 children, one baby and seven crew members - when it came down off the coast of Borneo Island on Sunday en route to Singapore from Indonesia.

The victims include an engaged couple heading off on a short break, a British businessman travelling with his two-year-old daughter, Christian missionaries en route to renew their visas, a young female university lecturer, and a family travelling to visit their daughter at boarding school.

Most of the victims on board the plane were Indonesian nationals, although there were also three South Koreans, a Malaysian, a French co-pilot, a Briton and a Singaporean 

Earlier today bodies were discovered alongside luggage, a plane door and an emergency slide in the water 100 miles off Indonesia, three days after the AirAsia plane vanished from radar screens within minutes of its pilot asking permission to climb 6,000 feet to avoid bad weather.

The vast majority of flight 8501's victims were Indonesian nationals - although three South Koreans, one Malaysian, a French co-pilot, one Briton and one Singaporean were also on board.

Despite many of the 162 people coming from the same country, details have emerged of diverse backgrounds, with the only thing uniting many of those of board being the fact they held a boarding pass for the doomed airliner on its scheduled journey from Surabaya in Indonesia to Singapore.

Among the victims were Ruth Natalia Puspitasari, her new toy-maker fiance Bob Hartanto Wijaya, and his parents Marilyn and William.

Miss Puspitasari's father Suyanto told how his daughter - who would have turned 26 on holiday next Monday - had called him in excitement to explain her birthday plans shortly before boarding.

He also revealed that the economics graduate had previously exhibited deep concern over missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, telling him of her sympathy for the agonized families of victims who have been left without information on their loved ones.

Meanwhile British businesman Chi-Man Choi, who is originally from Hull, Yorkshire, was flying from Indonesia to Singapore with his two-year-old daughter, Zoe, to celebrate New Year with his Singaporean wife and his family.

Also on board the doomed flight was Kevin Alexander Soetjipto, who is believed to have been a commerce student at Melbourne's Monsah University.

He was travelling with Cindy Clarissa Soetjipto, who was sitting next to him and is listed as his sister on Facebook.

The pair were seated with a relative named Rudy Soetjipto, according to the flight manifest.

Meanwhile family of four, Hermanto Tanus, his partner Indahju Liangsih and their two sons Nico and Justin, were on their wat to visit student Chiara Natasya Tanus.

The 15-year-old, who had moved to Singapore to attend school had been eagerly awaiting a visit from her parents and brother since moving two months ago.

Meanwhile the three South Koreans on board are believed to be Park Seong Beom, his wife, Lee Kyung Hwa, and their 11-month-old daughter Park Yu Na.

The Christian missionaries were on their way to Singapore to renew their visas so they could stay for another year in Indonesia.

Meanwhile, Hermanto Tanus, his partner Indahju Liangsih and their sons Nico Giovanni, 17, and nine-year-old Justin Giovanni were also on board the flight.

In Singapore, student Chiara Natasya Tanus, 15, had been waiting eagerly for a visit from her parents and brothers.

She had not seen her family, who are from Surabaya, since she left for Singapore to pursue her secondary education two months ago.

Elsewhere Louise Sidharta had been at Singapore's Chani Airport waiting for her fiance Siau Alain Octavianus to arrive off the flight.

The couple were reportedly planning to get married next year.

As well as the passengers, there were also seven crew on board the jet, including the pilot Captain Iriyanto.

His picture was posted on social media by his 22-year-old daughter Angela Ranastianis with the heartbreaking message: 'Papa, please come home, I still need you. Bring back my papa.'

Earlier today rescue workers searching for the doomed AirAsia flight 8501 have recovered six bodies from the Java Sea, Indonesian search and rescue teams have confirmed.

Bodies were discovered alongside luggage, a plane door and an emergency slide in the water 100 miles off the coast of Borneo Island earlier today, following three days of searching.

Officials have confirmed that the bodies and debris found in the Java Sea off Indonesia are from flight 8501, and a naval spokesman said the rescuers remain 'very busy' retrieving the victims.
