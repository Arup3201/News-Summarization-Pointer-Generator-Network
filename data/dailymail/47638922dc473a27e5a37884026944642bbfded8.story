A reigning beauty queen has given up her Miss Teenager Universe crown after claiming she was 'bullied' by organisers to find the next Australian contestant and pay for them to enter the competition.

Jasmine Stringer who won the title in Panama last July blamed international organisers for her resignation on Tuesday after financial discussions about awarding the crown to the next winner turned sour.

The Gold Coast beauty queen, 17, said she was told to find and pay for the next Australian contestant to enter this year's competition in Guatemala and pay her own way there to return the crown.

Beauty queen: Jasmine Stringer from the Gold Coast has handed back her crown after winning the Miss Teenager Universe crown in Panama last July

Her winning contract included a return trip to the 2014 contest later this year, but Ms Stringer was told she would have to forgo her title if she could not pay the money.

The financial discussions came about after Miss Teenager Australia organisers, Mark Williams and Thelma Rodriguez, moved to the US and decided not to hold the competition this year.

'If you cannot follow he (sic) crown you must give the title to first runner up and in this way we will make a formal statement to publicise the news,' an email from international coordinator Walter Guillen read, according to the Gold Coast Bulletin.

'If you want to follow with the title of Miss Teenager 2013 and come to Guatemala to deliver your crown and receive the second part of the award, you must pay $2,000USD to the organisation Miss Teenager Pageant.'

Ms Stringer said she entered the competition to take a stand against cyber bullying but now claims she has become a victim

Ms Stringer said she only received $2,000 of her $4,000 winnings and the rest will be paid when she returns the crown.

She entered the competition to campaign against cyber bullying but Ms Stringer said she was forced to resign to avoid being involved with an organisation that 'bullies their teenage queens'.

'For the past three months I have been bullied by the Miss Teenager Universe organisation run by Toni Berganza in Guatemala who has sent me threats and ultimatums involving finances which as a 17-year-old I do not have,' she said.

'I have represented as Miss Teenager Universe at an exceptional level expected of a beauty queen but unfortunately the organisation has not shown me any respect in return.'

The former directors of the Australian competition said they supported Ms Stringer's decision.

'We at Miss Teenager Australia completely support Jasmine Stringer's decision to resign as Miss Teenager Universe 2013. We have found the Organisation of Toni Berganza and their management of Jasmine throughout her year as their Queen to be very unprofessional with constant bullying,' they said.

'Jasmine is an extremely professional person and a great role model for any business and she has been a great ambassador to Australia.'

The organisers of Miss Teenager Universe have been contacted for comment.

Ms Stringer is now professionally modelling in Asia and is currently in Thailand
