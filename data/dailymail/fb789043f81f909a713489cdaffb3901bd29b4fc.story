Raymond van Barneveld has his sights set on winning a sixth world title – because he feels he has discovered a cure for his deteriorating eyesight.

For many darts players, who sometimes compete around the country on poorly-lit stages, ever-decreasing vision is what usually curtails a career.

Senior pros like 16-time world champion Phil Taylor, John Part and Gary Anderson have complained in recent years that as they have got older their ability to focus on the dartboard has gradually got worse.

Like them, Barneveld was concerned at the start of this year about properly being able to see the doubles and trebles. But last month, after a quick YouTube search, the Dutch ace chanced upon the 'Bates Method', an alternative therapy aimed at improving quality of vision.

After a few weeks of intense 'palm therapy' he says his eyes have improved so impressively that he has cancelled his laser surgery appointment in the New Year.

And, as a result, he is confident his healing hands will be holding aloft the Sid Waddell Trophy on January 4.

Barneveld, whose last world title was in 2007, said: 'Darts players often struggle with their eyes because of the light and the stress of playing every single week.

'I noticed that my eyes were getting bad because of my diabetes but I don't like playing with glasses.

'So, I went on YouTube the other day and found something about "palming". Basically you rub the palms of your hand together until they get extremely warm.

Van Barneveld had been struggling with his eyesight and was going to have laser surgery in the new year

'Then you place your palms on your eyes to warm them up. If you sit like this for ten minutes, you'll have better vision. I'm doing it twice a day – morning and night.

'I had known about this for two years but I was too lazy to do it. I do it ten minutes in the morning or before I go to sleep. And my vision is fine now.

'Trust me I already had an appointment on January 16 to laser my eyes because these are my working tool, they have to be right. You can't have blurred vision. But I have now cancelled my appointment because I am fine.'

Barneveld, who smashed debutant Rowby-John Rodriguez in the first round with a 125.25 average in the third set, faces Jamie Caven in the second round on Monday evening. He added: 'If I believe in myself, if I play like I did in the first round, then anything is possible.'
