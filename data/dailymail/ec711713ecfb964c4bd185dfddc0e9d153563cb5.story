Ron Klain, the former longtime Democratic Party operative named last week to be the White House's 'Ebola czar,' will skip a Republican-led congressional panel's hearing on Friday about the government's response to the disease outbreak.

The Democratic-controlled Senate won't hold its first hearing on the epidemic crisis until after Election Day. 

The White House's decision to spare him tough questions from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee comes after he missed two Ebola-focused meetings chaired by President Barack Obama in the first 48 hours after his appointment.

The first came Friday afternoon, hours before he a White House pool reporter spotted him entering the White House at 5:30 p.m.

The second – a nighttime gathering of 20 government VIPs, including Obama – came a day later after the president finished a round of golf.

White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz confirmed Monday that Klain did not attend, according to a different pool reporter. Schultz also confirmed that he would officially start work on Wednesday.

'It is not that long of a lapse,' he told reporters in Chicago, citing the cumbersome and bureaucratic employee 'onboarding process' that can take weeks or months.

Schultz explained the White House's decision to refuse congressmen the chance to question Klain.

'That will be day three of his tenure,' the Obama spokesman said.

The notion that Klain might be unprepared to fully participate in the administration's Ebola response plans on Day One brought words of disbelief from conservatives

RON KLAIN

Ebola's response coordinator didn't attend a Saturday night Ebola response meeting at the White House. 

The list of who did attend was a 'who's who' of top Obama administration officials:

'Mr. Klain is not a doctor, he's not a health care professional,' Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz said on Sunday on CNN's 'State of the Union' program.

'He doesn't have background in these issues. We don't need a White House political operative, which is what Mr. Klain has been. What we need is presidential leadership. The person who needs to be on top of this is the president of the United States.'

'We should be less concerned about giving the public the feeling that the government is on top of this,' Cruz said, 'and more concerned about the government actually being on top of it.'

Klain, a venture capitalist and former chief of staff to two Democratic vice presidents who led the 2000 legal team that tried to eke out a presidential election for Al Gore in Florida, has no experience with the health care sector.

'It befuddles me what they want' for the Ebola czar job, American Enterprise Institute scholar Scott Gottlieb told Reuters. 

'You want someone who can help coordinate across NIH, CDC, FDA; someone who understands the issues, the optics and knows what to ask for and knows who to go to.'

'There is a very steep learning curve' for Klain, he added.

Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee said Sunday on the CBS 'Face the Nation' program that Klain also lacks 'emergency response experience.'

'Maybe the Bush-Gore recount qualified in that,' she zinged.

Still, Monday's pool report from Schultz's informal press briefing noted that Klain has already met with White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough 'and some other folks,' putting him on reasonable footing to bring Congress up to speed during acommittee hearing.

White House Communications Director Jen Palmieri told USA Today that Klain's meeting with McDonough occurred Saturday, before the evening all-hands gathering.

The House Oversight Committee did not immediately respond to questions about who from the White House, if anyone, will be testifying in Klain's place. 

Schultz told reporters that 'the administration will have representatives there.'

Fox News first reported on Klain's pending absence on Capitol Hill.

'The White House has informed us that he has not yet officially started and will not be able to attend Friday,' a House Oversight committee aide told the cable news network.

Obama is on a political fundraising trip to Chicago, where Schultz said he is also doing 'a little bit of work from home.' That includes a briefing from Homeland Security adviser Lisa Monaco on the Ebola meeting that happened Monday in his absence.
