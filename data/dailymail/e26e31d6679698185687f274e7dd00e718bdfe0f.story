The financier tweeted about the bloody incident

A former environmental advisor to David Cameron killed a pigeon with his shoe after colliding with it as he cycled through London yesterday.

Ben Goldsmith, the son of the late billionaire James Goldsmith and socialite Annabel Goldsmith, hit the bird as he cycled through Glasshouse Street near Piccadilly Circus.

The financier tweeted about the bloody incident yesterday, as he described how he was forced to put the creature out of its misery by killing it with his shoe.

Unfortunately, it would appear that coach full of school children also witnessed the gory spectacle, as he said that he a group of youngsters who spied the death were 'very upset' about it.

He tweeted: 'Just biked over a pigeon. Had to kill it with my shoe. Really upset about it. So were the coachload of children who watched me do it.'

The brother of MP Zac Goldsmith, who has been an environmentalist since he was 13, declined to comment on the incident.

He is a co-founder of the WHEB group of green investment management businesses.

The RSPB told the Daily Telegraph that the advisor should have taken the injured creature to a vet, who could have given a professional opinion about how to treat the hurt bird.

It marks another unpleasant moment for the socialite this year.

He and his former wife Kate Goldsmith were divorced in April in 65 seconds on the grounds of Kate's adultery.

The multi-millionaire couple split last year after Mrs Goldsmith was believed to have had a passionate affair with American rapper Jay Electronica - leading to Mr Goldsmith's arrest for assault following a confrontation with his ex-wife and a bitter war of words over Twitter.

Police arrested Mr Goldsmith at the couple’s £20million Kensington home in April 2011 on suspicion of actual bodily harm.

It followed a confrontation between the Eton-educated financier, who inherited £300million after the death of his father, and his wife over explicit texts and emails between her and Jay Electronica.

Ben Goldsmith and Kate Rothschild married at St Marys Church Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk in 2003, but after a very public and bitter row, were divorced in 2013

Mr Goldsmith later accepted a caution for assault before announcing he was filing for divorce on grounds of adultery.

The affidavit in support of Mr Goldsmith's petition says he first became aware of his wife's adultery on May 31, 2012, and this is also admitted in Mrs Goldsmith's acknowledgement of service of the divorce petition.

The co-respondent was un-named in the documents.

The couple were just 23 and 21 when they married in Paris in September 2003 and have three young children.

After raging over Twitter, Mr Goldsmith admitted he was 'stupid' to have become embroiled in a nasty row after their breakup two years ago.

He is now dating film producer Jemima Jones.
