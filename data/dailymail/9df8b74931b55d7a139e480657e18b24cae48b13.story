FA chairman Greg Dyke looks like having a lot more success in the second half of his England Commission launched on Friday night than he did before the interval.

Dyke's plans for B teams and strategic loan partnerships announced before the World Cup have already been kicked into the long grass through strong opposition from clubs.

But his second effort to improve the long-term performance of England's national team by radically improving grass-roots pitches and the coaching of youngsters has met the approval of the Premier League and other stake-holders.

Greg Dyke is hopeful that the new plans can boost grass-roots football and help develop England stars

Report two acknowledges that the B team initiative of placing new sides within the football pyramid is doomed although talks are still ongoing about the slim possibility of the B teams entering the Johnstone's Paints Trophy or the FA Trophy.

But Dyke's grass-roots plans, which are far easier to bring about, are already up and running with the pilot project starting in Sheffield this month - already funded by the FA and the Football foundation - and preparation work underway in Liverpool and then Birmingham.

The FA are planning to install football hubs containing the latest artificial pitches (AGPs) in 30 cities in a £230m five-year project paid for by a combination of local authority financing and from football including critical Premier League support.

It is hoped by concentrating football in these specific areas , it will be easier to identify top talent coming through and provide the necessary coaching.

The hubs across each city will be owned and managed by a new local football organisation or Trust whose membership could include the local authority, the County FA and professional football clubs in the area.

The number of hubs in each city - between five and 20 - will depend on size and demand . Each hub will differ depending on local circumstances but will typically have 3 AGP's and a turf one, be floodlit and contain changing, classroom and catering facilities.

The coaching to go with the hubs will be brought under the control of a new Head of Education reporting to Dan Ashworth, effectively the technical director of the FA.

A further 25 full-time FA coach educators will be recruited with the FA also planning over the next three years to triple the number of Youth award Level 3 coaches from 800 to 3,000, triple Advanced Youth Award holders from 200 to 750 and increase Pro Licence holders from 200 to 300.

The England Commission was set up to boost the number of English players in the Premier League

Dyke said: 'When I first got this job Arsene Wenger said to me that the trouble with English football is that your boys from the age of 10 are not technically good enough. I am not sure that we buy that but we're looking again at facilities and coaching.

'I went back to the football pitch I used to play on as a kid and it's still the same now. Nothing has changed. So if we can implement our proposals for radical changes, it will make a big difference.

'It's expensive, but if we can find the money, I think we will transform football and the way it is played in those cities.'

England's dismal performance at the World Cup has led to questions about the structure of English football

The Premier League will back the proposals which will hopefully produce more young talent like John Stones

Dyke is hopeful of receiving backing from the Government and the Premier League, who have been involved in the process throughout in a rare example of the two warring football bodies working with each other rather than against.

Richard Scudamore, Premier League chief executive, said: 'The Premier League and our clubs have a long held commitment to investing in and supporting community sports facilities, sports participation projects, and schools football.

'In the 2013/14 season alone we invested in 52 new 3G artificial grass pitches, our club community coaches delivered 66,000 PE lessons in primary schools, and 20,000 children participated in our competitive schools football programme.

'We were consulted by the FA Chairman's England Commission as part of its research into the provision of grass roots facilities and coaching and welcome proposals to enhance both areas.

'Getting this right is imperative to the good health of the game at all levels – players like Raheem Sterling and Calum Chambers have to start off somewhere. The Premier League and our clubs will keep playing our part to help ensure that the provision of top quality facilities and coaching is delivered where it is needed most and will have greatest impact.'

Dyke added: 'They are all interested but waiting to see what the other one puts in. I don't think £50m-a-year for five years is an unreasonable amount of money.'

And Dyke, asked how far football's tanker has been turned by his Commission, believes: 'A fair bit' if the stricter rules on work permits and home grown players, the accepted parts of his first report, are added to the facilities and coaches reforms.
