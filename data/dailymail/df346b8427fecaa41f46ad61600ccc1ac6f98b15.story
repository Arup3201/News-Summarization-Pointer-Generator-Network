The international break is usually a time for Premier League managers to clear their thoughts, regroup and kick on for the rest of the season.

But with the summer transfer window fast approaching, scouting has gone into overdrive and several top clubs have players lined up for bids in June.

So, with most nations in action over in the next week, Sportsmail takes a look at where you can find your next potential star.

Borussia Dortmund is one of several possible Premier League signings in action over the next week

Nicolas Otamendi (Valencia)

ARGENTINA vs El Salvador, Ecuador

The Valencia defender has been linked with a switch to Manchester United, though it will cost Louis van Gaal £37million to meet his buy-out clause.

Argentina play two international friendlies before the Copa America starts this summer, and should be expected to turn on the style. 

Nicolas Otamendi is a Manchester United transfer target but Valencia won't let the defender go on the cheap

Memphis Depay (PSV), Stefan De Vrij (Lazio) 

HOLLAND vs Turkey, Spain

Manchester United and Tottenham are both watching PSV winger Depay, while De Vrij was watched by a Red Devils scout when Lazio beat Hellas Verona at the weekend.

Holland are looking to recover in their qualification for Euro 2016, before a high-profile friendly against Vicente Del Bosque's Spain side. Can they repeat their World Cup win?

Memphis Depay is enjoying a fine season with club and country and Tottenham Hotspur retain an interest

Man United scouts watched Lazio defender Stefan de Vrij in action against Hellas Verona on Saturday

Andriy Yarmolenko (Dynamo Kiev), Yevhen Konoplyanka (Dnipro)

UKRAINE vs Spain, Latvia

Liverpool have been tracking this duo, who are still both plying their trade in their native country. The Reds came within whiskers from signing Konoplyanka at the end of the January transfer window last season.

With his contract expiring this summer, the qualifier with Spain and friendly against Latvia will be a good chance to impress.

Andriy Yarmolenko will also be in action for Ukraine this week and is another Premier League target

Danilo (Porto)

BRAZIL vs France, Chile

Real Madrid are thought to be the favourites to the sign the Porto right back, who has shunted Dani Alves out of the side and been compared to Cafu.

But Manchester United still hold a firm interest in him, and he is expected to start in the glamour friendly in Paris on Thursday night. 

Danilo has been compared to Cafu with the Brazilian national team and has ousted Dani Alves from the squad

Mats Hummels (Borussia Dortmund) 

GERMANY vs Australia, Georgia

Mats Hummels is set to leave Dortmund. Could Louis van Gaal finally prise away the captain he has been after?

United will be one of many clubs holding a firm eye on Germany's friendly with Australia on Wednesday evening, as well as the qualifier against Georgia.

Mats Hummels is set to leave Borussia Dortmund and Manchester United could pay the £36million fee

Yacine Brahimi (Porto)

ALGERIA vs Qatar, Oman

Yacini Brahimi has been a driving force for Porto this season, and was a star at the World Cup with unfancied African nation Algeria last summer.

Mancehester City are thought to be admirers, and Brahimi will be in action in the two friendlies in the Middle East.

Yacine Brahimi is enjoying a fine season with Porto and is the Algeria national team's star man

Kevin de Bruyne (Wolfsburg) 

BELGIUM vs Cyprus, Israel

Bayern Munich are thought to be the frontrunners for the former Chelsea midfielder now shining at Wolfsburg, but could Jose Mourinho be tempted to go back in for De Bruyne?

The Belgians host Cyprus in a Euro qualifier on Saturday, before a friendly away at Israel three days later.

Aleksandar Dragovic (Dynamo Kiev)

AUSTRIA vs Liechtenstein, Bosnia-Herzegovina

A highly-rated centre back, Dynamo Kiev are resigned to losing Dragovic to one of the top European clubs.

Arsenal are interested, but Liverpool and Everton could also place a bid this summer. Fancy watching him in action? 

Aleksander Dravovic is a promising defender and will be in action for Austria over the international break

William Carvalho (Sporting Lisbon) 

PORTUGAL vs Serbia, Cape Verde Islands

The Carvalho saga continues. The holding midfielder is an ever-present in an impressive Sporting Lisbon side, but Premier League clubs are yet to take a risk with the youngster.

Now shining for his national side too, he'll be in action against Serbia and the Cape Verde Islands. 

William Carvalho continues to be linked with several of the Premier League's top clubs

Jackson Martinez (Porto)

COLOMBIA vs Bahrain, Kuwait

Another man impressing in Portugal, club side Porto say the poacher can leave if a suitable offer comes in.

The Colombia star has lavished praise on Arsenal in the past, and there may be scouts watching as the South American nation play two friendlies in the far-east.

Jackson Martinez has admitted in the past that a move to Arsenal from Porto would interest him
