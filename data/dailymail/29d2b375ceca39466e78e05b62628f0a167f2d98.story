A dodgy car dealer called Claus who ripped off thousands of unsuspecting customers has been told he must pay back  £6million or  face jail.

Kirk Claus found himself on his namesake's naughty list after he sold faulty vehicles with sand filled radiators and false warranties, a court heard.

Leeds Crown Court was told the rogue car dealer also sold cars that had been written off by insurance companies and laughed when angry customers complained.

The 47-year-old is said to have made more than £15million from the dodgy deals. 

Claus, who ran Chequered Flag Car Sales in Hipperholme, West Yorkshire, was sentenced to three years in prison in August 2012 for conspiring to defraud the customers and money laundering offences. 

In 2012, Leeds Crown Court heard how Claus and five other men used the dealership rip off thousands of customers.

He was also given nine months in prison for contempt of court for refusing to reveal his full assets and is banned from being a company director for five years.

Now he has been ordered to pay back £6,203,025 within six months or face seven years behind bars.

Making the Confiscation Order against Claus, Judge Guy Kearl QC said: 'You have never paid income tax or completed a self assessment.

'You disguised your true identity to conduct business in cash and have done everything possible to thwart the confiscation process.'

Judge Kearl also ordered Claus, of Calderdale, West Yorkshire, to pay compensation totalling £44,430 to 19 of the victims. 

Chequered Flag Cars and Bikes Limited was fined £250,000.

The Confiscation Orders followed an investigation under the Proceeds of Crime Act by the North East Regional Asset Recovery Team and the Yorkshire and Humber Regional Trading Standards Scambuster Team.
