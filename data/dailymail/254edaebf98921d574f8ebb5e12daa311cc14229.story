UEFA’s disciplinary panel has taken action against three clubs following racist incidents during the qualifying rounds for this season’s Champions League.

Steaua Bucharest, Debrecen and Maribor have all been hit with partial stadium bans, along with FC Chikhura Sachkhere who have been given the same punishment for an incident in Europa League qualifying.

'The fight against racism is a high priority for UEFA,' said a statement on UEFA’s website.

Sanction: Steaua Bucharest will have the National Arena partially closed after a racist incident during Champions League qualifying

'The European governing body has a zero-tolerance policy towards racism and discrimination on the pitch and in the stands.'

Debrecen were punished following incidents in their match against Cliftonville in Hungary on July 22, while the bans for Steaua and Maribor relate to their matches against Stromsgodset and HSK Zrinjski respectively the following day.

Chikhura Sachkhere played Bursaspor on July 24.

All four clubs will be required to close specified sections of their stadiums for their next European match. 

Steaua are
 due to host Kazakh side Aktobe in the third round of qualifying on 
Wednesday night after a 2-2 draw in the first leg of their tie, while 
Chikhura will host Neftci in the third round of Europa League qualifying
 on Thursday with their tie still goalless after 90 minutes.

Debrecen
 and Maribor are both away this week as they seek to reach the Champions
 League group stage, with Debrecen 1-0 on BATE Borisov as they head to 
Belarus and Maribor leading Maccabi Tel Aviv 1-0 ahead of their second 
leg.
