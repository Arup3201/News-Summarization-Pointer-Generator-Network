A girl who was given no chance of survival before she was born has stunned doctors by growing into a healthy six-year-old.

Kaylyn Fry weighed just 1lb 11oz when she arrived 14 weeks early following a range of life-threatening complications in the womb.

Her devastated mother, Ayla Blaikie, 28, was even told where she could bury her child after the placenta ruptured just 16 weeks into her pregnancy.

Kaylyn Fry (pictured with her mother, Ayla Blaikie), six, was given no chance of survival when the placenta ruptured 16 weeks into her mother's pregnancy

The complications continued and Miss Blaikie’s waters began to leak at 21 weeks.

She also needed eight blood transfusions, and contracted life-threatening infections group B streptococcus and MRSA - both of which were passed on to her unborn baby.

But against all odds, Kaylyn kept up her fight in the womb until 26 weeks, when a doctor told Miss Blaikie he had never see a baby born alive following so many problems.

Now aged six, Kaylyn, who was expected to be blind and brain damaged and who spent three years in and out of hospital with chronic lung conditions, is a picture of health.

She has even taken up Tae Kwon Do.

Miss Blaikie, from Eyemouth, Scottish Borders, said: ‘Kaylyn was definitely meant to be here. She’s a little fighter - literally. 

‘She is such a feisty, outgoing little girl and has overcome so much. It’s amazing.’

After her birth, Kaylyn spent four months clinging to life in two different hospitals, in Newcastle and Edinburgh.

Kaylyn survived the placenta rupturing but was in danger again when her mother's waters began to leak at 21 weeks. Things got worse when Ms Blaikie contracted two infections, both of which were passed onto Kaylyn

Eventually, Kaylyn was born 14 weeks early and spent four months in hospital. She also had to be on a ventilator for a week and had to have three blood transfusions

Weighing just 1lb 11oz, she was so small her mother could cup her tiny body in her hands.

But despite her minute size, Kaylyn - whose middle name is Hope - put up a big fight as she battled a bleed on her brain, superbug MRSA, and group B streptococcus, which affects just one in 2,000 babies.

The bacteria is found in one in three women and normally has no effect on babies.

Kaylyn also spent a week on a ventilator, had a hole in her heart and needed three blood transfusions.

Even when she was allowed home from hospital after 16 weeks, it was feared she would be blind.

Her parents also had to be trained how to resuscitate Kaylyn, who spent a year on oxygen, as her lungs were so underdeveloped.

Ms Blaikie says she sees Kaylyn as a 'little miracle' because she survived against the odds

When she was born, Kaylyn weighed just 1lb 11oz and she spent her first three years in and out of hospital

But the youngster, who has also battled countless chest infections and pneumonia, has astounded medics and her parents with her incredible resilience.

And as she approaches her seventh birthday next month, Miss Blackie said: ‘Every time it’s her birthday it reminds us of how lucky we are.

‘All though my pregnancy I was constantly being told that they didn’t think she was going to make it. I was even told about the cemetery for babies who didn’t survive. It was really upsetting.

Despite everything she went through, Kaylyn is now a healthy six-year-old

‘Even when she was discharged from hospital after almost four months she was showing no signs of being able to see at all. She had to be seen by an eye doctors for a year. That was one of the biggest worries.

‘Now we are just so grateful she is here and so happy and healthy. She has done so well. It’s amazing.’

Miss Blaikie and Kaylyn’s father, Michael Fry, 38, were originally told she was suffering a miscarriage when she started to bleed at 16 weeks.

And for the next seven weeks they were regularly told the pregnancy was not going to last 23 weeks, when there would be a slim chance Kaylyn would be able to thrive outside the womb.

But against the odds, at 23 weeks Miss Blaikie, an adult nursing student, was transferred 70 miles from the Borders General Hospital to Newcastle, where Kaylyn arrived three weeks later.

Recalling what happened, Miss Blaikie said: ‘I was in the labour ward regularly because of the contraction pains I was getting. But nothing happened. Then when I was in the antenatal ward one day I stood up to go to the toilet and she was basically there. 

‘She wasn’t at all where she needed to be and they had to wrap her up in tin-foil and rush her to the resuscitation room.

‘I thought I had lost her. I was really worried because she was blue and floppy and not breathing. But they came back after three hours and told me she was alive and they had managed to get her stable.’

The doctors had to resuscitate the tiny newborn and insert drains in her lungs to give her a fighting chance.

Miss
 Blaikie said: ‘When we finally got to see her she was really red and 
there were loads of tubes, monitors and beeping and every time we heard a
 beep I began to panic.

‘We
 were told she was getting the maximum amount of treatment she could get
 and for the first few days it didn’t look like she was going to make 
it.’

Ms Blaikie said: 'Kaylyn was definitely meant to be here. She's a little fighter - literally'

But after a week on a ventilator she was well enough to be transferred from Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary to the Simpsons Maternity Unit at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, where she spent the next 15 weeks.

Miss Blaikie said: ‘I spent weeks sitting by her incubator. She was so small. I remember her hands were absolutely tiny, but totally perfect.

‘After she was born her weight dropped to 1lb 6oz but by the time we got out of hospital she was 7lb.

‘She had quite a lot of problems until she was about three years old. But now nothing is holding her back.

‘When she first started school I couldn’t believe it. Not just that she had survived, but that she had no disabilities and was able to go. It was really an emotional day.

‘The doctor said he had never actually seen so many factors that resulted in a live birth before. She really is a little miracle.’
