It was a flippant joke made during the cut and thrust of a fast-talking satirical panel show.

However, comedian Jo Brand may well have been surprised by the reaction to one of her comments made on BBC2's Have I Got News For You.

When Brand glibly referred to the London suburb of Streatham as a 'sh*thole' it sparked a furious letter of complaint written by its town centre manager.

Furious Angelina Purcell penned a 300-word letter telling the comedian she had 'let herself down badly' and that her remark, made during Sunday night's show, had made her job 'ten times harder'.

Purcell said Brand did not understand the serious damage her flippant comment had on the town's collective efforts to transform Streatham's image and reverse its economic decline.

Lambeth Council employee Purcell said in the letter: 'You've made my job ten times harder with the use of one word and I'm sure the 60,000 residents and 3,000 businesses feel just as angry as I do.

'For us, you've let yourself down badly Jo and I hope you'll think twice about doing something like this again.'

Brand, 54, who lives in leafy Dulwich a coupe of miles from Streatham, was taking part in a discussion on the panel show when she referred to the area.

She pointed out that Streatham High Road had been voted as the Worst Street in Britain in 2002.

As well as labelling it 'a sh*thole', she added: 'Don't go'.

Sex scandal: Madam Cynthia Payne brought the area into disrepute when she was caught running a brothel from her home in Streatham, where patrons paid fo services with luncheon vouchers

The south London suburb is home to 
some famous faces. Former London Mayor Ken Livingstone, model Naomi 
Campbell and James Bond actor Roger Moore are all former residents.

In 1978 the area was at the centre of
a sex scandal when notorious madam Cynthia Payne was caught running a 
brothel from her Streatham home where patrons paid for services using 
luncheon vouchers.

Brand's spokeswoman said there was 'no serious intent' behind the joke, adding: 'When Jo is on tour she says this 
about every place she goes to and she has never had any complaints yet. 
Most people have a sense of humour about where they live.

'It was just a throwaway remark which is no way was supposed to have any serious intent behind it.

'As for some people not finding it 
funny, we'll take your word for it and she won't "diss" Streatham again 
in this way. We sincerely apologise for any offence that may have been 
caused.'
