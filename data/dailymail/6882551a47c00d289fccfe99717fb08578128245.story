Harvard University is under fire from faculty and students for secretly photographing about 2,000 undergraduates in 10 lecture halls last spring as part of a study on classroom attendance.

The experiment was disclosed at a faculty meeting Tuesday and first reported in The Harvard Crimson student newspaper.

Harvard computer science professor Harry Lewis asked administrators about the study during the meeting, saying he learned about it from two colleagues.

'You should do studies only with the consent of the people being studied,' Lewis told The Boston Globe on Wednesday.

Candid camera: Harvard University has admitted to secretly photographing students in classes in 10 lecture halls, in which more than 2,000 students were enrolled, as part of a study of classroom attendance

Brett Biebelberg, a junior involved in student government, called the study's secretive nature 'strikingly hypocritical', given that the university recently adopted an honor code for the first time.

Students and teachers were not notified because researchers did not want to introduce potential bias into the study, Harvard administrators said. 

The cameras took pictures every minute and a computer program used them to count empty and occupied seats.

The study was done by Harvard's Initiative for Learning and Teaching, overseen by Vice Provost Peter Bol, and authorized by the school's Institutional Review Board.

Professors whose lectures were monitored were told in August and all gave permission for the data to be used in the study, he said. 

Students were not told and the images themselves were destroyed, he said.

The university said they were not trying to track students.

Neither was it meant to monitor the teachers.

However it is unclear whether the controversial experiment was meant to do anything other than record attendance.

Harvard in March 2013 was criticized for secretly searching the university email accounts of 16 deans to find out who leaked information about a cheating scandal to the media. 

That led to new privacy policies on electronic communication this past spring.

President Drew Faust said she will have the latest case reviewed by a panel that oversees the newly established electronic communications policies.

'I indeed do take very seriously the important questions that this incident raises,' Faust said, according to The Crimson.

Campus under fire: The study has drawn criticism from both Harvard students and faculty due to the secretive nature of the recordings

It is the second time in as many days that Harvard has hit headlines.

On Wednesday it was revealed the school, which is number two in the nation, offered a seminar on anal sex on Tuesday aimed at promoting a holistic understanding of that specific type of intercourse despite the fact that it is widely considered taboo.

The student run workshop called 'What What in the Butt: Anal Sex 101' is a part of Harvard's annual Sex Week, a week of programming meant to help students better understand all its parts, even those less discussed.

The course description said that the class will delve into the misunderstandings of anal sex and will be an opportunity for students to ask questions in a safe, comfortable, and knowledgeable environment.
