Jilted: Andrew Walsh felt his ex-girlfriend loved her pet hamster, similar to the one pictured, more than him

A boyfriend became so jealous of his girlfriend's love for her hamster that he threw the pet out of her home.

Andrew Walsh, 30, became resentful of the emotional bond between the rodent and Julie Hanson when she broke up with him.

To get back at her he broke into her home in Blackpool, Lancashire, while she was out playing bingo with her mother magistrates were told.

He then released Harry the hamster from his cage.

Walsh broke her front down, opened the door to Harry's cage and then fled with a TV.

When Miss Hanson returned the following day she discovered the burglary and that Harry was missing.

Tracy Yates, prosecuting at Blackpool Magistrates' Court, said: 'Walsh had repeatedly asked Julie Hanson to re-kindle their relationship.'

'When he saw her at bingo she told him she was to stay at her mum’s that night.'

'The next day she found her front door broken in and the door to her hamster’s cage was open.

'The hamster was missing and it is the Crown’s case that Walsh was very much aware that she loved the hamster and had a string emotional tie to the animal which Walsh did not like.'

'She was very upset.'

'When Walsh was arrested he told police he had opened the cage door to give Harry his freedom.'

Robert Castle, defending, said: 'I am delighted to say the hamster has now been found. He was hiding under a rug and is safe and well.'

Walsh admitted burglary and was ordered to do 150 hours unpaid work, pay £85 costs and £60 victims' surcharge.
