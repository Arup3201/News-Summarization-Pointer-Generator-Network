Police are investigating a 'rod rage' attack after a fisherman was left with a hook in his face when he was targeted by a rival angler.

Nathan Ould, 39, was sitting in his boat when the barb was cast towards him and pierced his cheek in a row over mackerel.

Detectives say the culprit meant to hit him and positioned himself at Hope's Nose, in Torquay, Devon so Mr Ould was within reach.

The attacker then fled with the rest of his angling equipment and left his victim needing medical treatment to remove the metal hook from his left cheek.

Brutal: Nathan Ould was in his boat fishing for mackerel when a rival angler cast towards him and left a hook in his cheek

Rod rage: Medics had to help remove the two inch hook and police are sure that the act of violence was deliberate 

Mr Ould has described the moment the two-inch hook suddenly hit his face and believes he is lucky not to be blind.

His boat was several hundreds yards from of a group of recreational anglers and Nathan is certain one of them aimed at him intentionally.

The married father-of-two said: 'I could see some weights in the water a little way inside of me but I wasn't paying too much attention.

'The next minute there was an almighty bang as a weight hit the boat and as I turned to see what the noise was, whack, I got one in the side of the face.

'The hook was well and truly wedged in my cheek. It was bleeding badly. It could have hit me in the eyes. There was a group of lads standing laughing and joking but they denied it was any of them.

'Anglers are always casting towards the boat, in fact they try extra hard to hit you. It's to put you off and make you move on. They just object to you trying to earn a living there.

'It's not just fisherman who they are doing it at, kayakers are also being targeted.'

Incident: Mr Ould said that anglers object to commercial fisherman so they 'try extra hard to hit you' 

Picturesque: The assault happened here at Hopes Nose, near Torquay, Devon, where a gang of anglers were fishing

Devon and Cornwall Police say the popular angling spot was teeming with fisherman who may have seen the attack that happened at 6:30am Sunday.

A spokesman said: 'Police are appealing for witnesses following an assault on a fisherman. 

'It appears that the boat was deliberately targeted by a shore based fisherman by "casting" his rod in the boat's direction.

'On this occasion the victim was struck and a hook was embedded in his left cheek.

'There were a large number of shore based fisherman in the area at the time and police are appealing to them for information to identify the offender who is believed to have left prior to police attending.

'Police are also advising anglers of the seriousness of such actions and the injuries that it can cause.'
