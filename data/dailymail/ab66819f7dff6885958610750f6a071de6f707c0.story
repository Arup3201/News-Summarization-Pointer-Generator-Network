BBC Worldwide, the corporation's commercial arm, has launched its first YouTube channel consisting of entirely original content.

Called Earth Unplugged, it was created by the global natural history unit BBC Earth, and the corporation says it will become 'a destination site for wildlife and nature', offering a range of new films created for a digital audience by BBC Earth Productions.

The channel is BBC Worldwide's first original-content service on YouTube, and is expected to be the first of many.

Earth Unplugged, the BBC's first original content YouTube channel - which features entirely new programmes never seen on TV.

'With Earth Unplugged we're seeking to connect a new audience with the world around them,' Amanda Hill, the managing director for BBC Earth at BBC Worldwide, said.

'YouTube offers a fantastic opportunity to reach people and grab their attention with innovative nature content that will captivate and inspire.'

The BBC has previously kept most of its programming inside its iPlayer software, while other broadcasters such as Channel 4 have put full shows (with adverts) both on YouTube and their own on demand services.

Shows available include Amazing Animal Babies, which the corporation says 'is a must for anyone needing a weekly uplift' and features 'stunning films of cute baby animals revealing the extraordinary stories these infants have to tell.'

the is also a news show called Earth Juice, and special version of Walking with dinosaurs and 'Most Dangerous.'

One of the new shows is Amazing Animal Babies, which mixes footage of young animals with educational facts.

Â YouTube.com/EarthUnplugged is currently showing videos for seven new natural history shows:
