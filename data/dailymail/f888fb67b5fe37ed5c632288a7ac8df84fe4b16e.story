A man cheated on his wife of 30 years as she battled cancer, with a girl young enough to be his granddaughter.

Colin Brindley, 55, fell for 19-year-old Stacy Hughes, and within two months ditched his wife.

Miss Hughes, who is two years younger than his daughter, was pregnant with their first child within weeks.

It's over: Colin Brindley,  55, fell for 19-year-old Stacy Hughes, and within weeks of ditching his wife, his young partner fell pregnant with their son Connor

Love at first sight: Mr Brindley met Miss Hughes when they were both St John Ambulance volunteers in October 2009 - he said she gave him a chance to talk to someone 

Mr Brindley, defended his actions saying meeting Miss Hughes gave him a chance to talk to someone.

'I wasn’t happy in my marriage and I was making my wife unhappy – I think truthfully we both knew,' reported The People.

He said they had an amicable relationship and there was no-one else involved until he met Miss Hughes.

Miss Hughes, whose mum is 13 years younger than Mr Brindley, met him when they were both St John Ambulance volunteers in October 2009.

She had assumed he was in his forties, and said she was shocked to discover he was actually 55.

'It did make me think twice but I really liked him and it didn’t matter,' she explained to the newspaper. 

They quickly decided they wanted to be together and Mr Brindley, told his wife just before Christmas. 

His wife had just received the all-clear after battling breast cancer for two years.

He told her he had met someone else, which he thought she may have suspected, but declined to mention the massive age gap.

Miss Hughes had no serious boyfriends 
before meeting Mr Brindley and said her family took time to come to terms with their relationship.

On Christmas Day, the couple who share many pastimes like cycling and walking, spent the night in the back of Mr Brindley's car before moving in with one of his friends.

Happy family: The couple at their son's baptism - they have said they want more children, but Miss Hughes has had two miscarriages since having Connor

Mother and baby: Miss Hughes said she felt 'guilty about getting together with Colin because he was married.' She had no serious boyfriends before him and said her family took time to accept the relationship

Lots of his friends turned against him as news of his new relationship spread.

'People
 I thought were friends took sides after seeing the situation from afar –
 ‘she’s had cancer, he’s run off with a young bird, what a so-and-so' he
 told The People.

The couple stayed at the friend's flat because they had little money as Mr Brindley was out work.

In April 2010, the pair became engaged, just one month before Miss Hughes found out she was pregnant.

They
 now live in Bilston, West Midlands, with their year-old son Connor and 
his divorce is to be finalised in the next few weeks.

Mr Brindley revealed that his daughter still refuses to speak to him and when
 he sent her a text after Connor's birth, he 'got a bad response.'

He says he has no qualms about being an older dad and is looking forward 
to having more children with his partner, although she has had two 
miscarriages since their son's birth.

They have no plans to get married soon, although they would like Connor to be a page boy when they do finally tie the knot.
