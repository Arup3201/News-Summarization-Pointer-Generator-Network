The stepfather of the three-year-old boy who died in rural NSW last month has been arrested, the day after the toddler's mother was charged with the child's murder.

NSW Police confirm the 45-year-old man was arrested at a Bathurst address and taken to Bathurst Local Police Station for questioning, to assist strike force detectives with their inquiries.

The mother of a three-year-old boy who died in the NSW town of Oberon last month was arrested and charged with the murder yesterday.

The 40-year-old attended Blayney Local Court on Tuesday and did not apply for bail.

The case has been adjourned until November 10 at Bathurst Local Court, when the accused will reply to a brief of evidence in relation to the murder charge.

Detectives from Chifley Local Area Command have been conducting investigations to establish how the boy sustained his injuries and urge anyone with information to contact police.

Strike Force Aldyth has been established to investigate the child’s death, and comprises detectives from Chifley Local Area Command and the State Crime Command’s Homicide Squad.

Police were told that the toddler was knocked over by the family dogs and became tangled in his family dogs' leads. Pictured are stock images of the two dogs' breeds, an Alsatian, pictured left, and a husky, pictured right

The parents of the young boy originally told police that he had become entangled in the family dogs' leads, while they were walking in a park near their home in Oberon, 170 kilometres west of Sydney in the Greater Blue Mountains region.

Police and NSW Ambulance paramedics were called to a house at about 1pm on Sunday 3 August 2014, where they found a three-year-old boy unconscious and not breathing.

Officers performed CPR on the boy before he was airlifted to The Children’s Hospital, Westmead, in a critical condition. The child died on Wednesday 6 August 2014.

The boy's mother and stepfather showed police their version of events via a reenactment, and maintained the accident happened when they were playing in the park.

'They were just playing in the park. The dogs were on the rope. They pulled it out of my hand. It got him by the legs and flipped him backwards', the stepfather said.

A crime scene was set up at the home where forensic police officers examined the inside and outside of the premises as well as an area of the park.
