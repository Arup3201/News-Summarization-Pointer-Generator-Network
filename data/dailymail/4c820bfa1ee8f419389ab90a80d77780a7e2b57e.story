Chelsea continued their 100 per cent record in the UEFA Youth League as Jeremie Boga's first-half double eased them to victory over Maribor.

Boga struck after 13 minutes and again on the stroke of half-time as Adi Viveash's team moved to the brink of qualification for the knockout round.

They had earlier beaten Schalke 4-1 and Sporting Lisbon 5-0 to take command of Group G and Tuesday's win over the Slovenians further strengthened that position.

Chelsea dominated from the off at their Cobham training ground and took the lead when Boga exchanged passes with captain Isaiah Brown before firing home with aplomb.

Charlie Colkett then had a chance to double the lead on Chelsea's next attack but scuffed his shot wide from six yards out.

Charlie Wakefield, who had replaced the injured Ruben Sammut early on, then forced Maribor goalkeeper Damjan Prineg into a save with Brown unable to get to the rebound.

A free-kick from Colkett and an effort from Charly Musonda forced Prineg into evasive action as Chelsea pressed hard for a second goal.

It duly arrived on the cusp of half-time and in stylish fashion. Brown back-heeled to Boga, who took a touch to set himself and then powered the ball home from outside the box.

Boga could have claimed a hat-trick in the second-half but fired over on his left foot and then saw a venomous strike rattle the crossbar.

If Chelsea claim three points in the return in Maribor in a fortnight's time they will assure themselves of a place in the last 16.
