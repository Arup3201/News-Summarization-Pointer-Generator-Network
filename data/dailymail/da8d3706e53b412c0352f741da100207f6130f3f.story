Britain is set for a chilly start to the week with a cold air mass blowing from eastern Europe bringing temperatures as low as -2C.

After a crisp weekend in which parts of the UK saw freezing overnight temperatures, the tail end of a cold blast means spring will continue to be put on hold.

Clear skies at night will bring the coldest weather and will affect regions including East Anglia, with areas of high altitude, such as the Pennines, possibly seeing a dusting of snow.

Kirk Waite, forecaster at the Met Office, said: 'At the moment we're looking at things not changing much over the next few days with a lot of cloud and the odd bit of rain - but it will be mostly dry.

'It will be cloudy tonight with low temperatures of around 3C. Monday will see a cool, cloudy, grey start with the easterly cold air mass easing a little. We expect to see temperatures of around 9C in the North of the country and it will be a touch warmer in the South.

'Monday night could be the coldest night of the week where the cloud clears and in places such as East Anglia the temperature may fall to -2C.

'Throughout the week we're going to see an increasing amount of sunshine. It will generally be quite dry and settled.

'On Tuesday and Wednesday the temperature will move up to around 13C to 14C. It will still be just below average at night, but it's fairly normal to get these variations in spring.

'Snow is possible only in the highest parts of the UK such as northwest Scotland and the Pennines, but as there won't be much precipitation this is unlikely.

'On Thursday the daytime temperature will be slightly cooler and drop back to around 10C.'

Weather this weekend was in stark contrast to the beginning of the month when the UK was warmer than Rome and Athens at a balmy 17.5C.

Forecast: The UK is set for a cold and cloudy beginning to the week but temperatures will to rise on Tuesday and  sunshine will increase

Thousands of sun-seekers were pictured flocking to Brighton Beach and London's Hyde Park to welcome what they thought was the start of a new season.

On Friday a near total eclipse of the sun will be viewable from the UK but with cloudy weather predicted, people hoping to catch a glimpse of the spectacle may end up disappointed.

If the skies remain clear, it will be the best solar eclipse the country has seen since August 1999, with between 85 per cent and 95 per cent of the sun obscured.

The Northern and Western Isles of Scotland will see greatest eclipse, with nearly 98 per cent of the sun obscured at its peak.
