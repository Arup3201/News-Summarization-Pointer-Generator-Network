A Chinese trucker cheated death when two massive concrete pillars smashed through his cab.

Zhang Pan, 43, had been taking the concrete piles to a construction site where they were going to be used to provide support for a new high-rise building.

But as he drove around a slip road onto a motorway he realised that some of the pillars had suddenly fallen off the back of his truck.

Zhang Pan, 43, almost died when he slammed on the brakes sending two massive concrete pillars smashing through his cab in the city of Ningbo in eastern China's Zhejiang Province

They crashed down onto the hard shoulder in the city of Ningbo in eastern China's Zhejiang Province.

Then he slammed on his breaks - and two more pillars came crashing through the cab straight towards him.

Zhang told local TV: 'I slammed on the brakes when I heard the load slip, and two piles that weren't secured any more came smashing through the rear of the cab and out through the windscreen.

'When I realised what had happened I realised how lucky I was to be alive. If they can a few more centimetres to the side they would have taken my head off.

'But as it is, I simply got away with a grazed arm.' 

CCTV captured the moment the pillars fell off Zhang's lorry and he slammed on the breaks

Moments later the lorry is seen on the hard shoulder with two concrete pillars having crashed through the cab

Police said that the rope securing the concrete pillars had not been enough for the job and the driver faces charges of driving with an unsecured load.

'He is also in trouble with his employers who say he had the responsibility for making sure everything was safe before heading on the motorway.

'It took several hours for the truck which was unusable to be towed after it was unloaded of its remaining piles, and the whole mess cleared off the motorway.'
