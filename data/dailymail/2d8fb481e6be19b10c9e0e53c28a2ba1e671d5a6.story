A teacher has resigned after it was discovered she had rewritten her pupil's coursework to get them better grades.

The unidentified woman was working at the Falconwood Academy in Bexley, south London, when she faked all of her 69 pupil's BTec science work.

A whistleblower made the discovery last summer and raised the alarm with examining board Edexcel.

The school, part of the Harris Academy Federation, and Edexcel found the complaint was justified and the teacher was suspended, the Independent reports. She has now resigned.

Carpetright mogul Lord Harris of Peckham set up the Harris Federation to take over some of the worst performing schools.

Since 1990, it has taken over 27 schools in five London boroughs as well as most recently two schools in Thurrock, Essex.

Multimillionaire businessman Lord Harris has donated money to the Conservative party after making his £200million fortune from his business.

The Harris Federation employs around 2,000 staff and teaches 20,000 pupils at schools in Croydon, Southwark, Bexley, Merton and Bromley in London as well as in Essex.

Daniel Moynihan, the federation's chief executive, said this case was down to a 'misguided' teacher. He said: 'This is the first time in all that stretch we've had anything like this.

'We are determined that it won't happen again. The bottom line is that there was a single individual who was at best misguided in her desire to get students over the finishing line.'

Sir Daniel, who is a former headteacher of the first school the federation established, added: 'The coursework submitted for a whole group of students wasn't their own.

'We're disappointed because this is a school we have taken from 17 per cent getting A* to C grades including maths and English to 61 per cent despite being surrounded by four selective grammar schools.'

Harris Academy Falconwood was formerly the Westwood Secondary school and Westwood College.

The federation took over the failing school in 2007 and also joined Harris Academy Greenwich to offer sixth form courses.

The school is now writing to parents to explain what has happened and to offer pupils the chance to redo their coursework.

All of the pupils that had their coursework rewritten by the teacher gained five A* to C passes in other subjects so the discovery has not affected the school's league table results.

The Independent says it understands the fake coursework has not affected the students' plans to go on studying or start work.

Harris Academy Beckenham was also under scrutiny earlier this summer after a whistleblower complained that its teachers had exaggerated coursework in the speaking and listening section of GCSE English.

However in this case, exams regulator Ofqual cleared the academy of any wrongdoing. In a letter to the school, the AQA exam board said 'there was nothing heard that provided any evidence of malpractice'.

Improved marks in the speaking and listening section were 'justified' the AQA said.

In September, Harris Academy in Thurrock was ranked one of the best in the country.
