A giant 18-metre tall Santa Claus that has watched over a capital city each festive season since the 1960s may have seen in his last Christmas.

Looking down on busy Queen Street in the city of Auckland on New Zealand's North Island, the huge icon has been deemed unworthy of the $180,000 bill it takes to care for him each year.

Locals know the figure for his 'creepy' winking eye and wagging finger, The New Zealand Herald reported, but they're also devastated to see him go.

This giant Santa that has looked over Auckland for more than half a century may have seen his last Christmas

Tipping the scales at five-tonnes the Santa statue is more than half a century old, and his care was funded by national bookstore chain Whitcoulls until December 2008.

But according to the website, Whitcoulls announced they were no longer in a position to foot the bill and gave Santa to the city of Auckland as a gift.

From then the city centre business association Heart of the City (HotCity) partially funded the creepy statue's existence with the help of some sponsorships.

The jolly man had a make-over and his disturbing winking eye was fixed so his presence  was a little less frightening. 

But despite this a few years back he was voted the world's creepiest Christmas ornament by an American website. 

New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key spoke to More FM on Thursday morning, calling the demise of the special Santa Claus a national outrage. 

'I remember that Santa there with the slightly dodgy winking eye and the finger. But apparently the winking eye has been fixed up. It's been around since 1960 for goodness sake.'

He added that a working bee could be a good idea to help cover the costs, as the government wouldn't be able to help the city out and fund the friendly figure.

In a bid to try and save the Santa Claus the SkyCity hotel in Auckland has kicked off donations with $50,000, and encouraged other businesses to join.

But for now, the jolly statue is in pieces in storage, and will be kept there until it's decided what to do with him.

But one thing is for sure, locals are very upset about the loss of the statue that's knows when they're all sleeping, and knows when they're awake
