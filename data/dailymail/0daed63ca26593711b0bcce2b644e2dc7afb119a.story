The mother a six-year-old Louisiana boy who was killed by his school bus when he bent down to tie his shoes says she forgives the driver and doesn't blame her for the horrible accident.

Brenden Houston stopped in front of his school bus after getting off last Thursday afternoon and knelt down to tie his shoes in North Shreveport, Louisiana.

Bus driver Debra Stevens didn't see him and hit the boy with the bus. He later died at a local hospital.

Forgiveness: Jennifer Houston, Brenden's mother, says she forgives the bush driver who killed her son - and says the driver is grieving, too

Tragic: Brendan Houston, 6, was killed in Shreveport on Thursday after being struck down and killed by the school bus that dropped him home

Horrific: Brenden died shortly after being struck by this school bus on Thursday. He wore tie shoes to school instead of Velcro

'He wasn't paying attention because he was in his own world. That's how he lived. He didn't cause it, the bus driver didn't cause it, all the things surrounding it didn't cause it,' heartbroken mother Jennifer Houston told KTAL-TV.

'It happened, it was an accident, and we'll never get him back, but he'll be in our hearts forever.'

The community has responded to the tragedy with an outpouring of support for the Houston family. Brenden had seven brothers and sisters - including a twin sister.

Handwritten cards from Brenden's classmates have showed up at the Houston family's door. More than 20 teachers from Brenden's school came to his bedside at the hospital to pray for him.

But Mrs Houston spoke out the day after her son's death to support Ms Stevens, the 59-year-old driver who has been suspended pending a police investigation.

'People just need to understand, things line up like that sometimes and there's nothing we can do about it,' she said.

Brendan Houston, who has a twin sister, was described as a child who was 'always smiling'

'It doesn't make it hurt any less. But blaming somebody that's in as much pain as we are.... Two people are victims here. She is one of them. She's a grandmother and she loves those kids. Brenden was one of her favorites; he sat behind her everyday.'

Brenden's grandfather repeated those sentiments at a memorial service for him on Monday.

'We certainly want to extend to her our love and support and total forgiveness,' Randy Riley told KSLA-TV.

'We have absolutely no animosity toward her. It's just what you call an accident and if the Lord allows it, we'll learn to deal with it if that's what his will is going to be. We're OK.'

A roadside memorial has been created in Louisiana at the spot where a six-year-old boy was killed by his own school bus on Thursday afternoon.

Witnesses say that Brendan Houston, a first-grade student at Herndon Magnet School, had alighted the bus in North Highland, a suburb of Shreveport, when he realized his shoe laces had been tied together.

He stopped to fix the laces, but the bus driver, Debra Stevens, didn't see him and pulled out.

Brendan was rushed to University Health in Shreveport, where he died of his injuries.

'I heard somebody say, ''Uh oh, oh, oh, oh,'' like that,' Sara Ward, whose house is near where the accident occurred on Winter Garden Drive, told KSLA.'Somebody was laying in the road. I thought maybe a child had passed out, or got knocked down.'

It then became clear it was much more serious.

'His shoe laces had been tied together and when he got off, you know, he was shuffling and he reached down in front of the bus to untie his shoe laces. She did not see him,' Ward said.

Ward added: 'The bus driver was out here (on the grass), right here next to my little bridge just in hysterics, in hysterics.'

Shreveport Police say Stevens was taken to the hospital for routine toxicology tests, but that impairment is not suspected.

Flowers and a stuffed animal have been left there near the intersection.

Friends, classmates and neighbors are struggling to comprehend the sudden and tragic loss of the little boy, who was said to be 'always smiling'.

Caddo Parish School Board spokesman Victor Mainiero said additional counselors were on hand to help students and staff.
