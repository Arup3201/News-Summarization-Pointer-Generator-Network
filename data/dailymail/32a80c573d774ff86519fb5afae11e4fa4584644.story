An Iranian unhappy at being refused asylum by the Home Office has fought nine legal battles in less than five years, judges said today.

The 20-year-old lost the latest round of his fight to stay in the country in the Court of Appeal today.

But he still has another avenue of appeal open to him and could take his case to the Supreme Court.

Appeal: The 20-year-old Iranian today lost a Court of Appeal fight against an earlier immigration tribunal hearing

The man, who was not named in the written judgment, came to Britain unaccompanied in January 2009 when he was 15, and claimed asylum.

Since he has been in Britain, the man has fought his case at immigration tribunals and the High Court - mounting appeals and launching a judicial review.

Three judges today dismissed his latest appeal following a hearing in London.

The man was appealing against a decision by an upper immigration tribunal decision to refuse him permission to challenge a decision by first-tier immigration tribunal.

'We heard the appeal on 12 October 2013,' said one appeal judge, Lord Justice Maurice Kay, in a written ruling.

'This was the ninth occasion on which the appellant's case received judicial consideration.'

Lord Justice Maurice Kay said the man arrived in the UK unaccompanied in January 2009 when he was 15, and claimed asylum.

He said the man's claim centred on a piece of legislation which requires Home Office officials to protect the best interests of unaccompanied children arriving in the UK by trying to trace family members as soon as possible.

The man claimed that Home Secretary Theresa May had failed to comply with that 'tracing duty'.

Lord Justice Maurice Kay said the appeal was the latest in a series of cases in which complaints had been made about Home Office failures to comply with the tracing regulation.
