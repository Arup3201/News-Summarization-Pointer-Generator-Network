A peer caught up in a lobbying scandal is facing more embarrassing questions over claims that he was paid to host a reception costing £25,000 at Westminster on behalf of a green firm now under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office.

Lord Laird, who was recorded by undercover reporters apparently agreeing to lobby Ministers in return for money, organised the House of Lords event to promote the Sustainable Growth Group.

Its founder and chairman, British businessman Gregg Fryett, is in prison in Cambodia after being arrested by anti-corruption police.

The Ulster Unionist peer, who resigned the party whip earlier this month in the wake of the ‘cash-for-questions’ sting by the BBC’s Panorama, delivered a speech to more than 100 guests at the four-course dinner in 2011. The party later assembled on the House of Commons Terrace to sip champagne.

Praising Mr Fryett in extravagant language, Lord Laird said his vision of a world less dependent on harmful sources of energy was truly exciting.

‘We’re on the cusp of a sustainable evolution greater than the industrial revolution of the 19th Century and the digital revolution of the 20th Century,’ he told assembled guests.

However, a Mail on Sunday investigation, has discovered that the reality was shockingly different for up to 1,200 private individuals, many of whom were persuaded by independent financial advisers to unlock their pensions and move the money into eco-energy schemes run by Mr Fryett in South-East Asia.

Mr Fryett, 47, who is originally from Torquay, has lived in Thailand for several years. He was arrested in March by Cambodian investigators as he tried to resolve problems over land ownership rights. He has since been held in the tough Prey Sar Prison (above) on the outskirts of the capital Phnom Penh

Solicitor Gareth Fatchett, who represents about 900 investors who fear they may have lost their savings, said: ‘These were ordinary people who were sold a dream of making a modest profit while saving the planet.’

The sums invested range from £30,000 to £400,000, according to Mr Fatchett. Total losses could be as high as £32million.

Another of Mr Fryett’s companies, Sustainable Wealth Investments UK, which marketed ecological investment schemes, invited Lord Laird to chair its oversight committee, which was responsible for ensuring ‘the highest standards of governance and professionalism’ in the firm’s dealings with the public.

Mr Fryett said yesterday that Lord Laird had sought a retainer of £3,000 a month to take on the role.

Enticing: Literature relating to the House of Lords event

Speaking yesterday in the Cambodian jail where he has been held for the past three months, Mr Fryett said he fell out with Lord Laird when the peer allegedly asked Sustainable Growth Group to lend £100,000 to Christopher Knight, an American business associate who earlier this year was revealed to be a registered sex offender in Florida.

The invitation to chair the committee was withdrawn because of a disagreement over the decision to lend money to Mr Knight and the retainer was never paid.

At the heart of the investment opportunity endorsed by Lord Laird at the House of Lords lunch was an obscure plant called jatropha.

It was initially hailed by environmentalists as a source of a revolutionary bio-fuel and Virgin Atlantic boss Sir Richard Branson once suggested that jatropha could make the high-polluting aviation industry more eco-friendly.

However, it is now seen as having limited potential.

Enthusiasm for it dimmed when the respected New Scientist journal calculated that an area twice the size of France would be needed to grow enough of the shrub to power the world’s airline fleet.

The Sustainable Growth Group went into liquidation in February 2012 and the 15,000-acre site in Cambodia set aside for jatropha cultivation was abandoned.

Mr Fryett, 47, who is originally from Torquay, has lived in Thailand for several years. He was arrested in March by Cambodian investigators as he tried to resolve problems over land ownership rights in relation to the jatropha plantation.

He has since been held in the tough Prey Sar Prison on the outskirts of the capital Phnom Penh.

Speaking to The Mail on Sunday at the jail yesterday, the divorced father of two, who insists he is an innocent victim of corruption, said his company hired Lord Laird to organise the parliamentary reception.

‘His role was to facilitate the use of the House of Lords,’ said Mr Fryett, who is suffering from suspected tuberculosis and has lost about 2.5st in prison, where he shares a 19ft long cell with more than 20 other inmates.

‘Lord Laird was paid as a speaker. I don’t know how much money he got because my colleagues organised that side of things.’

Four months after the reception, according to Mr Fryett, Lord Laird approached Sustainable Growth Group’s chief executive James Whale and asked him to arrange a short-term £100,000 loan to Mr Knight, who had employed the peer as an adviser during an attempt to take over the Belfast Giants ice hockey team.

Mr Fryett said: ‘James told me, “Someone wants to borrow some money and Lord Laird is involved.”

We had a lot of money in and it wasn’t going into agriculture at that time. We lent £75,000 and then another £25,000. It was supposed to be paid back within two weeks.

The Mail on Sunday has established Lord Laird collaborated with Mr Fryett in a proposed scheme that involved trading carbon credits with indigenous communities in the Philippines. The peer wrote on official House of Lords notepaper to the queen of the Manobo tribe two years ago. Members of the tribe, pictured above

‘When we started getting issues with Christopher Knight we stood that down [the invitation to Lord Laird to chair the oversight committee]. We had agreed a fee with Lord Laird but I am not sure if we paid him anything.’

Since his arrest Mr Fryett has had no communication with the peer.

Mr Fryett accused the SFO of being overzealous in its investigation and claimed his business would have made a healthy profit if it had been given time to grow. ‘We would have been on the US Stock Exchange. If I was corrupt, I would be on a yacht in the Bahamas rather than in jail after coming back here to Cambodia to fight for the investors.’

This newspaper has also established that Lord Laird collaborated with Mr Fryett in a proposed scheme that involved trading carbon credits with indigenous communities in the Philippines.

The peer wrote on official House of Lords notepaper to the queen of the Manobo tribe two years ago.

Under the terms of the Kyoto Protocol on environmental protection, developing countries can ‘earn’ carbon credits and then trade them with Western companies.

A carbon credit is defined as a certificate representing the right to emit one ton of carbon dioxide.

The forests of the Philippines soak up vast quantities of CO2. This gives the Manobo tribe a valuable ‘bank’ of carbon credits.

Mr Fryett and Lord Laird are understood to have sought to acquire the right to sell some of these credits to overseas investors.

In return, the tribe would be given a proportion of the profits. Tribal leaders withdrew from negotiations, concluding that a deal would not be in their interests.

Francis Hernandez, husband of queen Bae Merlin Coguit, said Lord Laird charmed them with offers to show the couple around the Palace of Westminster.

Although the queen was unable to come to Britain, her name was added to a letter supporting Mr Fryett’s vision of a global ‘sustainable evolution’.

Mr Hernandez told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Lord Laird invited us to Parliament but it didn’t happen. He was also supposed to come and see us but he wasn’t able to come so he sent his representative instead.’

US-educated Mr Hernandez admitted he had been flattered to receive a phone call from the peer.

‘It was an honour. He is in the House of Lords. He is royalty and I am just a commoner.

‘He said, “I am an indigenous person like you – I am from Ireland. I am also a worker for my people like you. So I appreciate what you are going through.” ’

A Serious Fraud Office spokesman said this week: ‘Our investigation is ongoing. No one has been charged.’

Mr Whale, who now works as an environmental consultant, confirmed that Lord Laird had been the intermediary in arranging the loan to Mr Knight, which he said had been approved by Mr Fryett.

Mr Fryett’s UK lawyer has said his client went to Cambodia after receiving assurances from authorities that he would be treated as a victim of land fraud, not a suspect.

Panorama reporters, posing as lobbyists for a fake company, recorded Lord Laird apparently setting out ways he could press for new laws on behalf of a South Korean solar power firm.

He has denied wrong-doing and his conduct is now being investigated by the parliamentary standards watchdog.

The Mail on Sunday made repeated efforts to contact Lord Laird in relation to our interview with Mr Fryett.

We spoke to Lady Laird and sent a series of questions to Ulster Unionist Party press officer Stephen Barr. There was no response from Lord Laird. Mr Barr said: ‘We have had no contact with Lord Laird since the whip was withdrawn.’

No one was available for comment at Mr Knight’s last known address in Ford Lauderdale, Florida.
