A pregnant California professor will face charges for allegedly shoving a 16-year-old anti-abortion protestor and stealing another picketer's sign during a campus demonstration earlier this month, a prosecutor said on Friday.

Mireille Miller-Young, an associate professor who teaches feminist studies at the University of California at Santa Barbara, faces misdemeanor charges of theft, battery and vandalism, Santa Barbara County District Attorney Joyce Dudley said in a statement.

Miller-Young was seen in a YouTube video viewed over 66,000 times clashing with members of the 'Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust' group who organized an anti-abortion event on the university campus in early March.

The video posted by the group begins with a written statement saying that a group was carrying signs showing 'images of abortion victims' and distributing pamphlets to provoke a dialogue among students.

It then claims a professor grabbed a sign from one of the protestor's, Thrin Short, 16 gave it to some of her students that were walking with her, and then walked off, with the protesters following her through several campus buildings.

'Before she grabbed the sign, she was 
mocking me and talking over me in front of the students, saying that she
 was twice as old as me and had three degrees, so they should listen to 
her and not me,' Short told Fox News.

The protesters, who cannot be seen on camera, can be heard saying, 'She's a thief. She's a professor'.

In response, Miller-Young turned around and said, 'I may be a thief, but you're a terrorist'.

When the protesters attempt to enter an elevator with Miller-Young, the group claims the professor shoved a protester several times and scratched her.

'It is ironic that a female professor, who claims to be pro-woman, would resort to theft and violence against another woman in her attempt to silence a different point of view,' the group said in a statement on its website.

The university did not immediately return phone calls and an email on Friday seeking comment.

Miller-Young's attorney declined to comment.

In an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent newspaper on Friday, Miller-Young said she was 'triggered' by the graphic images on the sign and pamphlets carried by the protesters.

She added that she was especially offended by the protesters' cause because of her focus of study and because she is currently pregnant.

Thrin's father, William Short, who met with prosecutors, said he would have expected an academic to engage in thoughtful debate with someone she disagreed with.

'She was free to engage in a rational dialogue with them,' Short said after learning the professor had been charged. 

'Instead, she chose to bully them, steal and destroy their property, and hit and scratch my daughter. After doing so, she said she thought she was setting a good example for her students.

'I think the goal of this prosecution should be to set a good example for her students, one that will not only deter her from repeating this conduct, but will also deter those who approve of her actions from imitating her appalling behavior.'

Miller-Young is scheduled for arraignment in Santa Barbara Superior Court on April 4, it said.

Her research explores race, gender and sexuality in visual culture and sex industries in the United States.

In a previous interview, she described herself as a 'porn scholar' when discussing her manuscript, called A Taste for Brown Sugar: Black Women, Sex Work and Pornography.

It's a study of African American women’s representation and labor in pornographic media.
