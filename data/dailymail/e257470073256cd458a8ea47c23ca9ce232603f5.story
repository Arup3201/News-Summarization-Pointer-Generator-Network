The new leader of Pakistani Taliban has promised a wave of terror attacks in revenge for the death of his predecessor who was killed last week in a U.S. drone attack.

Hardline commander Mullah Fazlullah was elected leader by Shura, the Taliban's supreme council, following the killing of Hakimullah Mehsud, the in a drone strike on November 1.

Fazlullah, known for his fierce Islamist views and rejection of peace talks, led the militants' brutal two-year 
rule in Pakistan's north-west valley of Swat in 2007 to 2009, and has been linked to the failed attempt to kill schoolgirl education 
activist MalalaÂ Yousafzai.

Threat: The Pakistan Taliban's new leader has vowed to orchestrate a a wave of terror attacks to avenge the death of his predecessor who was killed last week in a U.S. drone attack

Head of the Shura Asmatullah Shaheen said: 'We will target security forces, government installations, political leaders and police.'

He said the Taliban's main targets included army and government installations in Punjab province, the political stronghold of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.

He added: 'We have a plan. But I want
 to make one thing clear. We will not target civilians, bazaars or 
public places. People do not need to be afraid'.

Pakistan
 publicly condemns U.S. drone strikes as a breach of its sovereignty but
 in private officials admit the government broadly supports them. 
Militants are mainly holed up in remote areas on the Afghan border where
 the army has no presence.

'Pakistan has full information about drone attacks,' said Shaheen. 'Pakistan is a slave of America. It is an American colony.'

The Pakistani Taliban are fighting to topple the government and impose Islamist rule in the nuclear-armed nation.

Attacks have been on the rise since 
Sharif came to power in May, a concern for global powers already 
unnerved by the possible security implications of the planned withdrawal
 of most U.S.-led troops from neighbouring Afghanistan in 2014.

Mehsud
 and his allies had been tentatively open to the concept of ceasefire 
talks with the government, but Fazlullah, whose men were behind the 
attack on schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai last year, strongly opposes any 
negotiations.

No meaningful
 talks have taken place since Sharif's election and Fazlullah's rise 
could signal the start of a new period of uncertainty and violence in 
the already unstable region.

The Pakistani Taliban have links with al Qaeda and are also allied with but separate from the Afghan Taliban.

Fazlullah
 fled Swat when the army retook the valley, and is believed to have been
 in hiding in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan. Pakistan says he has
 directed attacks on its soil from across the border.

His men were blamed for beheading 17 
Pakistani soldiers in a checkpost attack in June 2012, and he appeared 
in a video posted online in September claiming a bomb blast that killed a
 major general.

In another video he vowed to do whatever it took to enforce sharia across Pakistan.

'We will eliminate anything that will
 get in the way of achieving this goal: father or brother, soldier or 
police, khan or malik (tribal elders) or mullah,' he said in the undated
 footage.

The
 decision to appoint him leader of the TTP was greeted with heavy 
celebratory gunfire in Miranshah, the main town in the North Waziristan 
tribal area.

Taliban
 'will be more brutal' The TTP, an umbrella organisation grouping 
numerous militant factions, has killed thousands of soldiers, police and
 civilians since 2007 in its campaign against the Pakistani state.

The
 killing of Mehsud in North Waziristan on Friday came as government 
representatives prepared to meet the militants with a view to opening 
peace talks.

It drew an angry response from Islamabad, with Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar accusing Washington of sabotaging peace efforts.

Prime
 Minister Nawaz Sharif was more measured, but said his government was 
committed to seeking peace through dialogue and stressing that an end to
 bloodshed could not be achieved 'by unleashing senseless force'.

Sharif
 came to power in May partly on a pledge to hold talks to try to end the
 TTP's bloody insurgency, which has fuelled instability in the 
nuclear-armed nation.

Imtiaz Gul, an author and expert on militancy in Pakistan, warned the choice of such an uncompromising leader would spell problems for the embryonic peace process - and a bloodier campaign from the TTP.

'The nomination of Fazlullah is a 
continuation of the terror campaign in Pakistan since the creation of 
TTP. It means they are not serious about any talks with the government,'
 Gul told AFP.

'TTP will be more brutal now.'

On October 9 last year a masked gunman in Pakistan's Swat Valley
 jumped into a pick-up truck taking a group of girls home from school 
and shouted 'who is Malala?' before shooting her in the head.

Her
 father asked his brother-in-law to prepare a coffin for her funeral but
 Malala was flown to the UK and woke up a week later at a hospital in 
Birmingham. Following treatment she gradually regained her sight and 
voice.

The world's reaction to her attempted 
murder led to the creation of the Malala Fund, which campaigns for 
girls' education around the world.

She
 has since received multiple awards including the prestigious Sakharov 
Prize for free speech, which is awarded by the European Parliament 
annually in memory of Soviet physicist and dissident Andrei Sakharov.

Previous winners include South Africa's Nelson Mandela and Burma's Aung 
San Suu Kyi.

No clear progress had been made in peace negotiations before the strike on Mehsud, and Shaheen dismissed the whole process as a sham.

'All the drama in the name of peace talks was staged to please America: on one side government wanted to talk to us and on the other side was talking to the Americans in Washington,' Shaheen said.

'We will not talk to the Pakistani government until it announces the complete enforcement of sharia.'Retired brigadier Mahmood Shah, a former security chief for the tribal areas, said Fazlullah's appointment had 'completely changed dynamics of the Pakistani Taliban'.

'Fazlullah was ousted from Swat valley, his hometown, and he is living in Afghanistan. He is wanted by Pakistan, so can he run the organisation smoothly from other side of the Durand Line?' Shah said.

The Durand Line is the border with Afghanistan.

Fazlullah, believed to be about 39, is the first leader not to come from the Mehsud tribe which dominates the TTP, or even the tribal areas, and Shah said this would weaken the movement's unity.

'There are other groups based in North Waziristan who were helping the Pakistani Taliban but they won't help Fazlullah as he can't even live among them,' he said.

The Taliban's ruling council, or shura, took several days to reach a decision, indicating a lack of consensus about who should lead them, but Shaheen insisted the movement was united.
