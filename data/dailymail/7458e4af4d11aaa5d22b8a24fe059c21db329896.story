Australian sprinter Sally Pearson said  suspended Athletics coach Eric Hollingsworth had a 'negative' impact on athletes

Australia's shining light on the athletics track Sally Pearson has let fire with a departing spray to suspended coach Eric Hollingsworth after winning Commonwealth Games gold.

The 27-year-old track star put an end to her week of silence on the issue - and months of 'negativity' with Hollingsworth at the helm of the athletics camp - by declaring she 'was probably the last supporter he had on the Australian team.’

Pearson said from the very moment he was sent home for comments made about her no-show at a Glasgow pre-Games meet, the morale within the Commonwealth Games team lifted immediately.

She repeatedly alluded to Hollingsworth as a 'negative' person during an interview with reporters after her 100m hurdles win.

She called his personality and style of coaching negative, and said the only way she was going to win that race was to put him out of sight and out of mind.

'He was very negative, and he has been negative to every single person in the team,' she said. 'You need to get rid of negativity and we did, and now everyone one can lift and be happy.'

Pearson's relationship with Hollingsworth went south following a comments he made at a track event at Poland this year

Pearson said her commitment to the sport was unwavering, and her preparation was not going to be hampered by the distraction of Hollingsworth's suspension.

'I don't run for anyone like that, I don't run for negativity.'

'I'm a competitor and I love to race and I love my sport so that's why I do it.'

Pearson has described the breakdown of her relationship with Hollingsworth as 'sad' - hitting an all-time low following the world indoor championships in Sopot, Poland, earlier this year.

She said she lost respect for the coach following 'harsh' comments he made about her performance.

'It is sad because I guess I was probably the last supporter that he had on the Australian team and he messed that up himself by really -  again, I am not sure of the word to use - but I felt really put down and he spoke down to me very harshly,' The Sydney Morning Herald reported.

'I am the sort of person that if you are going to treat me like that you’re not going to get much respect after it.'

Pearson crossed the line of the 100m hurdles in first place, winning back-to-back Commonwealth Games' Golds on day nine  

Pearson said it felt like a weight had been lifted off the shoulders of the Australian team when Hollingsworth was suspended

The issue was compounded by comments he made about her lack of support for the Australian team when she failed to show at the Glasgow pre-games meet due to other commitments.

'[To say] that I was not supportive of them (Australian team) that was very disappointing, because more than anything that is not who I am and all of you ... who have been interviewing me for so many years now know how excited I am to run for Australia.'

Pearson said she understood the need for her to be at the camp as team captain, but 'for a sport that is very individual, it is very important for that athlete to get the best out of themselves and their preparation.'

Others have spoken out about Hollingsworth in the days since his departure, including former Commonwealth Games gold medallist Fabrice Lapierre a long jumping gold medalist from the Delhi Games.

Lapierre said Hollingsworth was 'definitely' disliked by most athletes and laughed when he heard about his suspension.

'It's pretty funny I think. I guess a lot of athletes don't really like him. I don't really care,' he said.
