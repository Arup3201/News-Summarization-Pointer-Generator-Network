Rotterdam has just announced plans to break ground on a water-purifying wave pool smack dab in the middle of the city - meaning it will soon be possible to surf on a canal in the Netherlands.

In June 2015, Rotterdam will open RiF010, a barrelling 5ft, 14-second wave, situated on the city's famed Steigersgracht Canal, very near to the retail centre.

Initially conceived by Edwin van Viegan, the proposed City Initiative is currently in development at the Delft University of Technology, where a particular focus is being placed on the project's durability and sustainability.

The artificial river wave will not only generate electricity and provide power to the site, but will also offer additional environmental benefits to residents of the country's second-largest city.

Currently, the canal is made up of unsweetened pond water, but the wave-making process itself will actually work to naturally purify it. 

Additionally, any profit made from the wave pool will be reinvested both into the city's existing green initiatives and also directly back into the project, with hopes of developing an independent energy-generating windmill for the site in coming years. 

The RiF010 arena will cater mostly to kayakers, scuba divers, and surfers.

The site will also offer a terrace for spectators, a beach house with food and drink, and changing rooms and shower facilities.

Visitors will be able to rent canoes and other boats on the other side of the terrace, which links the site to the rest of the city.
