On January 25 1995, Eric Cantona was involved in an incident that would see him spend three-and-a-half hours in jail, miss eight months of football and do 120 hours of community service. 

The then-Manchester United forward was sent off against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park and, on his way to the dressing room, he then kung-fu kicked a home supporter.

Here, key witnesses to the incident reveal their version of events.

I couldn’t believe my eyes. For anyone who saw it, the only rational response was ‘wow’.

We all ran over to find out what happened, or more specifically why — what had caused him to do it. Had he been punched or something?

The game carried on, David May scored for us, then Gareth Southgate got the equaliser. It ended 1-1. That second half you had 21 footballers carrying on in a state of surprise.

I can’t recall the manager saying anything about it in the dressing room. If he did have a tizzy then our heads were too frazzled to take it in.

JONATHAN PEARCE (Commentating for Capital Gold Radio)

Cantona is dismissed! Can there be a place in the game for a man with such extravagant talent and such wicked temperament? A man who has now… Oh my goodness me! He just kicked… He’s punched a fan! Eric Cantona has jumped in and scissor-kung-fu-kicked a fan!

I have never seen as disgraceful an incident as that in all my years in football. Eric Cantona should be thrown out of the game for that sort of incident.

People say Palace had been winding Cantona up but that’s not true. My recollection is he was only challenged twice in the first half. Then, early in the second half, there was Cantona’s kick at Richard Shaw.

Peter Schmeichel launched one of his long kicks. There were only two players in the Palace half — Shaw and Cantona. They came together and Shaw turned more quickly. Cantona kicked out at Shaw so I dismissed him.

I did not see him kick the fan because I was dealing with Andy Cole who was suggesting I might not have made the right decision!

After the game one of my assistants told me what had happened but it was only when I saw it — at 2am on CNN — that my jaw dropped to the floor. I just thought ‘wow’.

NED KELLY (United’s ex-head of security, speaking to the BBC)

I followed him down the stairs with the wardens and when we stopped he looked at me and sort of shrugged his shoulders.

We went into the cell and were sitting down together, and the police warden came in and said: ‘Listen, don’t take any food from here. I’ll pop down the road and get some McDonald’s and chips’.

I gave him [Cantona] my phone so he could phone his wife. Then we’re eating away and having a chat about it, and he said: ‘I just can’t be bothered with all this, I’ll just serve my sentence’. I said: ‘No way. Let’s see what the outcome is’. But he was relaxed, signed autographs and took a couple of photos while he was there. He was so cool about it.

GARETH SOUTHGATE (Palace player that day)

A big altercation was going on as Eric was going off then we heard this strange noise from the crowd and saw stewards running over.

We carried on with the game and I remember my goal but as soon as we got back to the dressing room I realised it was not going to get the headlines!

It hit me how serious it was when we left our dressing room. The United players were lined up in the tunnel, dressed in club blazers, but nobody was speaking. They were very subdued and had been told not to make any comment, not to us, the press, nobody.

MAURICE WATKINS (United director and legal advisor at the time)

Eric took the situation very seriously. He attended every meeting and was always on time.

I recall vividly the moment in Croydon Magistrates’ Court, when the magistrate, much to the surprise of everyone, imposed an immediate prison sentence of 14 days.

Suddenly Eric was taken to the cells. We lodged an immediate application for bail, which was turned down. So I then had to run up to the Crown Court and successfully got bail and leave to appeal. But Eric had to spend three-and-a-half hours in a cell, and it’s fair to say he wasn’t too happy when we got him out.

We had called an emergency meeting at United and agreed to ban him for the rest of the season; four months, an unprecedented 21 games. But the FA extended it til the end of September, which we thought was harsh.

I thought we should have a press conference and he said he would only attend if he could say a few words. That’s when he delivered the infamous trawler and seagulls line. I thought it would be the best way to draw a line under the whole episode.

I remember him asking me for the English word for the boats that collect the fish, and the English for the birds that fly over the sea. Then he wrote the line on a piece of paper.

As one legal periodical put it, Cantona had committed the most high-profile common assault in the history of the English legal system.

He was banned from English football by the FA for eight months and ordered to carry out community service
