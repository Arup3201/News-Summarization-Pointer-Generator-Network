One subway train rammed into another that was stopped at a station in South Korea's capital today, injuring more than 100 commuters.

Yonhap news agency reported that mechanical problems led to the moving train running into the back of the other at 3.30pm local time (6.30am GMT) on the platform of Sangwangsimni Station, one of Seoul's major stations.

Officials are still investigating but it is believed that a failure of the train's automatic distance control system may have been responsible.

The subway train rammed into the back on another that was stationary at the platform of the busy station

The mechanism that is meant to make sure the train stops if it gets too close to another object is thought to have failed

170 people were hurt and 32 were taken to hospital, although no serious injuries have been reported

Investigations are still being carried out but it is believed a mechanical failure is to blame for the collision

The crash occurred at Sangwangshipri station, one of the busiest in the South Korean capital

Local media also reported long delays in officials providing instructions to passengers about what to do. This could strike a nerve in South Korea, where the captain of the ferry that tragically sunk on an April 16, has been condemned for waiting 30 minutes before issuing an evacuation order.

About 170 people were hurt in the accident and 32 were taken to a nearby hospital, but there were no serious injuries, a city official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because she wasn't authorized to talk to the media on the matter.  

Railway workers were called in to deal with the scene but authorities have been under fire for not reacting quickly enough

The accident occurred at 3.30pm local time, so luckily no during rush hour when the station is heaving

It was up to half an hour before passengers on the trains were told what to do by officials

One of the trains was simply waiting in the station when it was struck from behind

Another official later said it wasn't clear how many were taken to the hospital.

Hospital officials also said there were no serious injuries.

The accident comes as South Koreans are criticizing the government for lax safety practices that many feel contributed to the ferry sinking, which left more than 300 people, mostly high school students, dead or missing.
