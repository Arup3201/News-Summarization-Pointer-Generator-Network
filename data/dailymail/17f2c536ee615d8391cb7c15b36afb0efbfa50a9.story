The pattern is set, the trend well established. The world, in the complex mind of Jose Mourinho, has turned against Chelsea’s manager and he wouldn’t have it any other way. Why would he, when this was the plan all along?

Just as winning has been a theme of his career, so has the carefully-crafted tantrum. He will moan, defend the indefensible and attack the likes of Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp who, in the case of Diego Costa this week, say what the rest are thinking.

Some will call it a character flaw; others will recognise that it is a staple of his management. A master tactician he may be, but he is also a master of manipulation, of finding a way into the minds of his players and giving them extra incentives to fight. In football, siege mentality is the cliche that best sums it up.

It is a ploy used throughout his career, often at critical points in the season. In this campaign he has spoken of ‘campaigns’ against Chelsea. He has reacted furiously against suggestions that his players dive – anyone who watched their recent win against Hull might see through the argument – and now, he's incredulous at the criticisms aimed at Costa for stamping on Liverpool’s Emre Can. Costa has been charged and banned by the Football Association for three games for the incident. 

As a man equipped with two functioning eyes, Mourinho will not be blind to what Costa did. As a man whose side face Manchester City in a huge game this weekend, he will also not be blind to the benefits of a dressing room that feels it’s ‘us against the world’.

It’s not a new trick, but it works. Frank Sinclair, who played for Chelsea between 1990 and 1998, said this week: ‘Jose is a master of mind games, and the one thing he likes to have within his group is a siege mentality. He has always been like that and gets his group of players behind him, and makes sure they are all pushing in the right direction.

'When he has a press conference, he protects his players and that shows he is 100 per cent behind them and wants the players to be the same with him. When you speak to the players, that is the spirit they have got.'

It is something that has recurred throughout Mourinho’s career, and here are a select few instances:

CHELSEA - PART ONE 

It is part of the Mourinho method to claim his side face unfair obstacles, usually with the subsequent support of a prominent player.

In 2005, after a goalless first leg of the League Cup semi-final against Manchester United, Mourinho said: ‘Sir Alex (Ferguson) was very clever, if you can say that, at half-time by putting some pressure on the ref. In the second half it was whistle and whistle, fault and fault, cheat and cheat.’

Mourinho accused Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson of putting the officials under pressure 

John Terry backed up his point of view, before Chelsea went on to win the tie and then the trophy.

Later that year, Mourinho would accuse referee Anders Frisk of inviting Barcelona manager Frank Rijkaard into his room at half-time of their Champions League last-16 tie. 

Chelsea lost the first leg before winning the second and progressing, but in the bitter fallout, which included death threats, Frisk quit the game.

The Sporting Mind's Andy Barton, a mental performance coach, said last month: ‘Whether it's consciously calculated, which is a strong possibility, or whether it's an emotional response, which is also a strong possibility, Mourinho has, time and time again, shown a siege mentality with his teams, by creating common enemies

‘If you make yourself out to be a victim in a situation, if you've got loyalty in your team, which he does, it just creates a stronger bond.’

INTER MILAN  

Mourinho enjoyed great success at Inter and most notably won his second Champions League trophy. Despite enjoying huge resources while he was in Italy, he would identify his side’s relative lack of media support as an unfair disadvantage in Inter’s battles with AC Milan and Juventus.

In April 2009, with Inter seven points clear of Juventus and nine matches remaining, he said: ‘We have the Inter Channel with its 45,000 subscribers, Juve have Tuttosport and Milan have three TV stations and the newspapers. I feel a bit like Robin Hood.’

Not surprisingly, the claims came at a time when Inter were in the middle of a defensive crisis.

While Mourinho has certainly never been afraid to draw battle lines between himself and a rival manager or officials, the media appears to be a favoured target, particularly when making the point that his sides are treated unfairly.

Take these comments from 2009: ‘There has been the greatest amount of intellectual manipulation. There was a concerted, organised effort to manipulate public opinion.

‘It was fantastic work but it is unrelated to my world – I work in football. I don’t like intellectual prostitution, I like honesty.

‘Over the last few days nobody has mentioned that Roma have great players but will end the season without a title. Nobody has mentioned that Milan have 11 fewer points than us and will end the season without a title.

‘Nobody has spoken about Juventus, who have won so many points thanks to refereeing mistakes.

‘Every time I turn on the TV I see Luciano Spalletti (the then Roma manager), who is everyone’s friend, but I don’t like prime-time television. I don’t know whether these people pay to be interviewed. I know that they offer me money for interviews and I refuse because I don’t manipulate reality.’

REAL MADRID  

Perhaps at no other point in his career has Mourinho made bigger claims of unfair treatment. At one stage he suggested there was a plot to get Barcelona and Unicef to the Champions League final ahead of Real Madrid.

That flashpoint came after a bad-tempered 2-0 win for Barca in the first leg of the 2011 semi-final. Mourinho said: ‘I don't know if it is the Unicef sponsorship or if it is because they are nice guys. I don't understand.

‘Congratulations to Barcelona on being a great team and congratulations for all the other stuff you have which must be very hard to achieve. They have power and we have no chance.’

Mourinho also said: ‘Guardiola is a fantastic coach but I have won two Champions Leagues. He has won one Champions League and that is one that would embarrass me.

‘I would be ashamed to have won it with the scandal of Stamford Bridge and if he wins it this year it will be with the scandal of the Bernabeu. I hope one day Guardiola has the chance of winning a proper Champions League, a brilliant, clean championship with no scandal.’

Barcelona went on to win the Champions League and Emmanuel Adebayor supported his manager by calling the Catalans ‘cry babies’.

CHELSEA - PART TWO  

The Happy One has slowly reverted to type. Last season he claimed Chelsea were shown a lack of respect in the scheduling of their match with Liverpool, when a Champions league semi-final was in close proximity.

He said: ‘In the last 10 years, Chelsea was the most important club in this country, defending this country in European competitions. It's the last club to be European champion, it's the last club to win the Europa League, it's the club with the record of presence in semi-finals and Chelsea fans think Chelsea deserves more respect than Chelsea is getting.’

This season he has claimed there was a ‘conspiracy’ against his side after Cesc Fabregas was booked - incorrectly – for diving against Southampton. He has also claimed more recently of a campaign against Chelsea and defended a striker who apparently stamped on another professional. He has since cancelled Friday’s press conference.

Great theatre, but it’s the same old story.
