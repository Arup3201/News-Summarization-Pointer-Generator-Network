Homeowners are suing the producers of an X-rated web reality series after sex parties were allegedly thrown at their Hamptons house during a summer rental and now they say the salacious gatherings have caused neighbors to gossip that they are running a home of 'ill-repute.'

Stuart and Susan Silverman leased the property in East Hampton, Long Island to a businessman -Â  who failed to tell the couple that the luxury home would be used for 'pArty of 5', an Internet show featuring scantily-clad women and drinking.

The couple, from Brooklyn, have filed a complaint at Long Island Federal Court for unspecified damages including $20,000 in repairs and a couch with 'sperm stains that could not be removed'.

The couple found out what was happening at their home on June 23 last year after being tipped off by neighbors that a huge party was underway.

They discovered dozens of cars, security guards and around 100 people, according to the New York Daily News.

The Silvermans later found pictures of their home online dubbed as the 'Vice Hamptons Crib' along with women in 'various stages of undress'.

The couple said that their neighbors now view them in a less than favorable light following the scandal.

The man who rented from the couple is Joshua Blackman, who runs a company called Vice Energy LLC.

He rented the pad for $10,000 last 
June for one month and allegedly told the owners he planned to use the 
spot for family gathering and barbecues.

According to the lawsuit, the couple 
claim they have been 'harmed psychologically' after pictures of their 
vacation residence began circulating that showed 'women in various 
stages of undress [and they] are now viewed by members of the community 
and potential tenants as running a house of ill-repute,' the New York Post reported.
