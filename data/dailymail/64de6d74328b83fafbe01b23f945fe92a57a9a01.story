A couple's big day was thrown into chaos on Friday when a drunken wedding crasher began shouting obscenities and chucking beer cans at guests, police said.

As the bride and groom exchanged vows during the picturesque beachfront wedding on Florida's Marco Island, 22-year-old Bradley John Stiner was allegedly intent on disrupting the ceremony.

Police said that Stiner first ran back and forth behind the altar trying to draw attention to himself.

The Naples Daily News reported that as he was ignored, his methods became more bold when he began shouting obscenities at the wedding party.

Stiner was also heard shouting:  'Hey tourists, get off my beach, I'm local.'

As a final insult, Stiner allegedly threw unopened beer cans at the wedding party, striking several people - including the best man.

By then, some of the wedding guests had had enough, and chased him away. Others called the police.

When officers caught up with Stiner 
elsewhere on the beach, he said he had the right to be on the there as a
'taxpaying citizen.'

The Daily News reported that he also claimed he was a veteran who deserved to do 'whatever I want.'

Stiner has served in the U.S. Navy, according to his Facebook page.

A police report said that Stiner was so intoxicated that he had trouble standing without swaying back and forth.

He was arrested and charged with disorderly intoxication.

Stiner also faces a misdemeanor battery charge in the beer can tossing after the best man said he would press charges, the Daily News reported.
