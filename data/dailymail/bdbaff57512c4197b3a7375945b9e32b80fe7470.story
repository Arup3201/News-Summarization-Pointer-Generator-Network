The Towie fan who fled ISIS terrorists with her toddler son could be sent back to Syria by Turkish authorities.

Tareena Shakil, 25, ran away to Syria last year after telling relatives she was going on holiday to Spain with her 16-month-old son Zaheem.

But she escaped back across the Turkish border after, she claims, the militants tried to force her into marrying a one-legged fighter.

However, instead of being deported to Britain, Shakil, from Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, might be sent back to Syria and into the clutches of ISIS.

A source told the Sunday Mirror: 'Tareena doesn't have an automatic right to return to the UK. The Turkish authorities could decide to send her back to Syria.

'She entered Syria illegally and the normal action is to return illegal immigrants to the country they've come from. It's unlikely she would be sent to Syria but not impossible. A lot will depend on what she says in interview. The fact she has her son with her makes it less likely.

'They are on the front line with ISIS and will have little sympathy towards her.'

Shakil is being held at a facility on the border town of Gaziantep and her father has flown out to join her, as has her estranged husband Sam.

Mohammed, her 42-year-old father, has previously told how his daughter was a one-time Spice Girls fan, a school prefect and Girl Guide and was so fascinated with ITV reality show The Only Way Is Essex that she travelled 150 miles to buy clothes at a shop run by one of its stars. 

Her brother Tareem, 22, said: 'At first no one suspected anything, then she said she was at the border of Syria. She sent us messages saying she'd gone over for a new life, that she had been radicalised.

After fleeing her British home in November last year, Shakil entered Syria through the Turkish border. She has since returned to the country after 'begging guards not to shoot her'

'She said she wanted to live in the way of Allah. She was promised a good life with a good husband. She wanted to live under Sharia law.

'But it wasn't like that. Then she was texting saying she might not make it back. She was messaging, "Please help me, I made a stupid mistake. Please Dad, will you come here and get me?" He was planning to go out there, but she made the escape herself.'

Her escape saw her dash through a no-man's land near the Turkish-Syrian border, where snipers on the Turkish side did not fire on her.

She then scrambled over a barbed wire fence, injuring her feet but somehow keeping young Zaheem unharmed. 

The Foreign Office source added that Shakil would be questioned over possible terror offences and sent on a course to 'de-radicalise' her if she is sent back to Britain.
