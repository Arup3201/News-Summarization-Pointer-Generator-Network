Brian Williams met with NBCUniversal's CEO on Tuesday morning as a question mark hangs over his future as anchor of the network's Nightly News. 

Williams, 55, visited Steve Burke at his apartment close to Central Park in Manhattan on Tuesday morning, CNN reported. The pair later left the building together.   

The meeting came amid reports that NBC's top executives cannot agree on whether  Williams should be axed or remain at the network after he falsely claimed he was in a helicopter that was hit by a grenade while in Iraq in 2003.

A fact-checking investigation by NBC has been taking place into Williams' reporting with a 'progress report' delivered to top brass at the network on Monday.

Veteran investigative reporter Richard Esposito, who is Williams' colleague at NBC, has been heading up the probe which will be completed 'sooner rather than later' but doesn't have an exact timetable, according to CNN. 

Doubt has been cast on Williams' broader reporting at NBC over the last decade after it emerged that he had lied about his time in Iraq.

The decision on Williams' future will be taken by top NBC execs but they reportedly failed to reach a conclusion after a weekend meeting at the home of NBC Universal CEO, Steve Burke.

According to the National Review, some execs believe that Williams' career at the network was over because he has lost credibility with viewers.

However who exactly will step into Williams' shoes was also causing NBC a headache - his current sub at Nightly News, Lester Holt, does not draw the ratings that make Williams' show number one.

The National Review also suggested that execs were planning to put Tom Brokaw back in the anchor chair until Today show host Matt Lauer could transition into the role. However pulling Lauer from Today could see the morning show flounder - when it was already behind ABC's Good Morning America in the ratings.

The Drudge Report said on Tuesday that Lauer's co-star, Savannah Guthrie, was also being considered by NBC execs as a replacement for Williams. 

On the flip side, NBC News president Deborah Turness and her boss, Pat Fili-Krushel, chairwoman of NBC Universal news group, were backing Williams because they 'wanted to save their jobs' and not see Nightly News slide to number two position, National Review.com reported.

It was yet another major decision facing Ms Turness, former editor of ITV News in the UK for ten years, who took over at NBC in August 2013.

In November she fired hotshot executive Jamie Horowitz, formerly of ESPN, who had been hired to turn around ratings at Today. In a memo to staff, Turness described him as 'not the right fit' and cut him loose after less than three months. 

The Today Show's Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie have been rumored replacements for Brian Williams at Nightly News should he get the chop

Some critics suggest that Williams, who apologized last week for his false claims about Iraq, should be fired.

Others wonder if commerce will win out, since Williams has kept Nightly News at the top of the ratings while much of his news division crumbled around him. How much are the years of good work worth?

'This is one of the toughest calls that I've ever seen,' said Paul Levinson, professor of communications and media studies at Fordham University. 'On the one hand, the public is right to expect nothing but the truth from our reporters and our news anchors.'

Williams announced on Saturday he was stepping away from the show for a few days.

Williams' sub, Lester Holt, told viewers midway through Monday's broadcast that Williams had taken himself off the air because questions have been raised about how he recalled several stories. Holt did not specify what the stories or questions were.

'He'll be off while this issue is dealt with,' Holt said.

Levinson pointed out that this isn't a case of someone deliberately inventing news sources or, in the case of Dan Rather at CBS a decade ago, reporting during a presidential campaign a story casting doubt on President George W. Bush's wartime record that could not be backed up.

'The real difficulty for a news organization, or a reporter, is that once you've made one misstep, it's really hard to earn (trust) back,' said David Westin, former ABC News president. 'You can. But it takes a lot of time.'

The incident should remind news organizations that it's more important to report the news than 'brand' their personalities, he said.

More than 1,000 comments were posted to NBC's 'Nightly News' Facebook page. The majority supported Williams, with some posters suggesting they wouldn't watch the broadcast until he returned. But some commenters said they wouldn't trust him again.

Williams took a pounding in the ratings for his final night on the air on Friday, but it's unclear whether the drop in viewership was related to the controversy.

The Nielsen ratings company said ABC's 'World News Tonight' had 8.46 million viewers on Friday, while NBC's 'Nightly News' had just under 8 million.

For this television season as a whole, Williams' newscast has led in the ratings by an average of roughly 600,000 viewers each night over ABC.

On Thursday, the night after Williams' apology, NBC beat ABC by about 800,000 viewers, Nielsen said.

Although NBC leads in the ratings this season as it has for much of the past decade, ABC's broadcast with David Muir does win occasional nights. ABC has beaten NBC on nine nights since the beginning of the TV season in September, six of them Friday nights, which in general is NBC's weakest evening. On the Friday before Williams made his admission, ABC won by 400,000 viewers.

Meanwhile, another instance emerged of Williams appearing to embellish a wartime reporting experience.

Williams traveled to Israel in July 2006 to cover that country's military campaign against Hezbollah. The anchor reported on MSNBC that he flew in a Black Hawk helicopter with Israeli military officials at a height of 1,500 feet. He said he saw a trail of smoke and dust where Katyusha rockets had landed in the uninhabited Israeli countryside. Then, he said he witnessed two rockets being launched toward Israel some 6 miles from where he was flying, according to the network transcript.

In an interview at Fairfield University more than a year later, Williams said Katyusha rockets passed 'just underneath the helicopter I was riding in,' according to a film of the interview, described in The Washington Post on Monday.

Williams was even more descriptive in an August 2006 appearance with Jon Stewart on Comedy Central's 'The Daily Show.'

'Here's a view of rockets I have never seen, passing underneath us, 1,500 feet beneath us,' Williams said. 'And we've got the gunner doors on this thing, and I'm saying to the general, some four-star, 'It wouldn't take much for them to adjust the aim and try to do a ring toss right through our open doors, would it?''

Also Monday, the newspaper Stars and Stripes released a transcript of its interview with Williams last week, made before his apology, in which he attempted to explain his story. 

Williams was asked about a claim by military involved in the 2003 Iraq mission that his helicopter was flying about an hour behind the Chinook helicopter that had been hit by the rocket-propelled grenade.

Williams said it was the first he'd heard of that.

'I could not see in front of us, and I thought we were just in one flotilla, for lack of a better word,' he said.

Currently off the air after he admitted to lying about being hit by enemy fire in Iraq, a number of Williams' other seemingly outlandish claims are currently coming under increased scrutiny

Red Bank, New Jersey, 1970s

In a 2011 interview, Brian Williams recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy. However in a 2005 Esquire interview, Williams had claimed to save not one but two puppies.

In the same Esquire interview Williams also revealed that he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling Christmas trees in the sleepy New Jersey town in which he grew up. 

A number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone ‘stuck a .38-caliber in my face'.

Iraq War, 2003

Over the years Williams has told multiple versions of a story about being in an Army Chinook helicopter during the Iraq War in 2003. 

Last month he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire, an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present. 

Williams issued an on-air apology and wrote on Facebook: 'Nobody's trying to steal anyone's valor.'

Hurricane Katrina, 2005

Williams has told several stories about his experiences reporting from New Orleans. 

He has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city's French Quarter – even though the area wasn't flooded. 

The accuracy of other Katrina claims, including that he caught dysentery drinking the flood waters and that his hotel was ‘overrun’ with gangs, have been called into question by others who were on the ground during the disaster. 

Israel, 2006

In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams recalled 'Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in' during a trip to Israel. 

In fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described a helicopter under fire a distance away.

Boston, 2006

A Navy vet accused Williams of lying to skip an event honoring members of the Armed Forces so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live.

On the day of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society event the NBC News anchor told organizers that a 'pressing engagement' meant he wouldn't be able speak at the dinner, but later that evening he appeared in a walk-on role on SNL's Weekend Update.
