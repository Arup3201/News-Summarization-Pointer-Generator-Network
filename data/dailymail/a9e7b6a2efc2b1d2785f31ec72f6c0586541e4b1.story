Julie Andrews has revealed how the spectacular hilltop opening scene of the Sound of Music took a week to shoot because it was filmed with a helicopter before filmmakers had drones at their disposal.

The famous scene sees the actress throw herself into a full-bodied twirl with her arms outstretched and sing the film’s opening words: ‘The hills are alive...’

And as part of a 50th anniversary special, Diane Sawyer and her film crew recreated the famous scene, but with a drone - it took them about four takes in just half an hour.

The drone flew over the top of the trees and captured Sawyer as she span around. It took her film crew about four takes in just half an hour

The 79-year-old told Diane Sawyer in the upcoming '20/20' special that although the shot looked perfect it required a great deal of effort

Although the film was set in Austria, the filming of the movie’s title song was carried out in Mehlweg in southern Bavaria.

The 79-year-old actress told ABC's Diane Sawyer in the upcoming  '20/20' special that although the shot looked perfect it required a great deal of effort.

'This giant helicopter came at me sideways with a very brave cameraman hanging out the side of … where the door would be normally … the helicopter would shoot me, and I'd come from one end of the field and he'd come from the other,' Andrews recalled. 

'I'd make the big turn, and then he'd go around me to go back and start again, and I'd run to the other end.

'Every time he went around me, the downdraft from the jets would fling me down into the grass,' she said

Julie Andrews filming as Maria in The Sound Of Music which opened 50 years ago and quickly became the most popular film on the planet

'But every time he went around me, the downdraft from the jets would fling me down into the grass.'

Andrews, who was signed to play Maria for a fee of $225,000 (£150,000), without any share of the profits, had to have her hair and clothes  refreshed after each of the nine takes it took to get the scene completed.

In his book ‘The Sound of Music Story’ Tom Santopietro details how having been knocked down on half of the ten takes, even the placid actress ‘finally got so angry I yelled, “That’s enough!”’

But she couldn’t be heard over the sound of the helicopter, and the pilot interpreted his star’s hand signals as a thumbs-up gesture of, ‘You’re doing great – let’s go for one more.’

Andrews, who was 28 during the filming, told Sawyer said that the brook, which was actually plastic filled with water, was also brought in by the movie studio and the birch trees were also brought in.  

In his book Santopietro writes how helicopter rentals were very expensive, and the budget was so slim on the film that With only the first half of the number requiring the use of the helicopter, as soon as the shot was captured, the pilot would instantly fly to Obersalzberg for the filming of the movie’s finale: the von Trapp family’s escape over the Alps into Switzerland. There was no money for even one more day’s helicopter rental. 

The story – based on fact – of Maria von Trapp, an Austrian nun turned governess who married into a musical family and defied the Nazis, inspired devotion and ardent fervour.

On every continent where it played it set one box office record after another. 

It ranks as the fifth highest-grossing film of all time (when gross is adjusted for inflation) and is, arguably, the most beloved film ever.
