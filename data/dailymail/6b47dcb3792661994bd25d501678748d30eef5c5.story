Celebrating with her former lesbian lover as they receive a £10,000 lottery win, this is ‘monster’ mother Rebecca Shuttleworth just months after beating her young son to death.

Footage of the moment she whooped with delight at the prize emerged yesterday as the ‘cruel and vicious’ 25-year-old was sentenced to life in prison.

She had subjected two-year-old Keanu Williams to months of horrific cruelty and was ordered to serve at least 18 years.

Just eight months after his death, a two-minute video posted on YouTube by the People’s Postcode Lottery shows her hugging and kissing a former partner as a cheque is handed over.

Shuttleworth smiles as radio personality Judie McCourt discusses the pair’s plans to spend the winnings on home improvements and a holiday. The pair later separated and Shuttleworth was seen attending court with another woman she described as her partner.

A family friend yesterday hit out at the mother’s ‘sickening’ decision to celebrate in public after her son’s death. ‘It turned people’s stomachs to see her so happy after the terrible things she’d done,’ the friend said.

‘She was whooping and celebrating without a scrap of guilt. She deserves to rot in hell.’

Brutal: The jury in his mother's trial heard that the two-year-old sustained 37 separated injuries to his body when discovered by paramedics

Denial: Rebecca Shuttleworth and Luke Southerton, pictured together in the dock of Birmingham Crown Court, both denied murder. She was found guilty, he was cleared

Shuttleworth, described by police as ‘a monster’, was sentenced at 
Birmingham Crown Court after being found guilty of murder and child 
cruelty.

Mr Justice Spencer told the weeping 
child killer: ‘One can scarcely imagine the pain and distress Keanu must
 have suffered from this outburst of violence.’

Of the child, he added: ‘He was a 
delightful little boy described as a real character, a little 
entertainer who remained cheerful despite everything.

Joyful was the word that more than 
one witness used to describe him – he was a favourite at nursery as well
 as within the family.’

The judge said Shuttleworth, who had had a troubled upbringing and spent time in care, had shown a ‘cruel and vicious’ streak.

Crime scene: Police and forensic officers the area around the flat in Birmingham where Keanu Williams was found dead

Hellish: Pictured is the bed where Keanu Williams, who was discovered by paramedics with 37 separate injuries on his body, would sleep

Keanu died of internal bleeding in 
January 2011 after being beaten over 48 hours at the Birmingham flat of 
Shuttleworth’s then partner, Luke Southerton, 32.

There were 37 signs of injury on his body, including a fractured skull.

Southerton was cleared of murder, 
manslaughter and causing the death of a child, but convicted of cruelty 
and given a nine-month suspended jail term.

As Shuttleworth wept in the dock, the
 judge added: 'By the jury's verdict, you alone were responsible for the
 violence which led to Keanu's death.

'One can scarcely imagine the pain and distress Keanu must have suffered from this outburst of violence.

'He
 must have been terrified, it must have been clear to you as soon as the
 violence had taken place that Keanu was badly in need of medical 
attention.'

Shuttleworth had decided not to seek 
medical help because she knew his injuries, including internal bleeding 
to his abdomen, could not be explained away, the judge said.

Explaining how he had arrived at the 18-year minimum term, the judge said the murder was aggravated by several factors.

Outlining
 some of the aggravating features of the case, the judge told 
Shuttleworth: 'Keanu was particularly vulnerable because of his age.

'His was a lingering death over many hours following a brutal assault by his own mother.

'This
 was the grossest abuse of a position of trust - you were his mother and
 it was your most basic and natural duty to protect him.

'I accept that there was no intention to kill but this was a brutal and sustained attack.'

A review has
 begun into why social workers failed to spot the abuse.

Keanu’s injuries were not ‘isolated’ but part of a long chain of abuse by his mother, who now faces life behind bars.

Yet Shuttleworth, 25, had duped officials into thinking she was ‘caring and competent’.

It adds to questions about children’s 
services at Labour-run Birmingham City Council, rated ‘inadequate’ since
 2009 after deaths of children known to social workers.

Cases include 
that of seven-year-old Khyra Ishaq, starved to death in 2008.

Last month the department was labelled ‘utter chaos’ by members of its own watchdog.

Yesterday Jane Held, head of the 
Birmingham Safeguarding Children Board, which is reviewing Keanu’s 
death, said social services, medics and police ‘missed a significant 
number of opportunities to intervene’.

Catalogue of injuries: Rebecca Shuttleworth was convicted of murdering her two-year-old son after subjecting him to savage and sustained abuse, the injuries resulting from which where detailed at Birmingham Crown Court

Sustained abuse: Keanu was taken to hospital with burns and blisters on his foot, but his mother said it was from a radiator he slept near, which was accepted by police and health workers

Birmingham Crown Court heard that Shuttleworth had ‘resented’ Keanu virtually from his birth in 2008.

Shuttleworth, who was living with 
Keanu’s father in Torquay, Devon, saw the child as an ‘obstruction to 
living her life as she wanted’, the jury was told.

Keanu Williams' family has been 'torn apart' by his death, according to his aunt.

Angela Shuttleworth, 26, Rebecca Shuttleworth's sister, said the death of the toddler who was known in the family as Kiwi had left 'a gaping hole in our lives'.

In a statement she said: 'Keanu was an amazing little boy who had developed a real personality.

'He was full of life and loved playing with his siblings and cousins. He enjoyed all his toys and would empty the toy box every time he came to play, but he especially loved Iggle Piggle from (children's television programme) In The Night Garden .

'Kiwi also loved food - he ate everything and was hungry all the time.'

She added: 'Since the tragic death of Kiwi, we haven't been able to grieve or say goodbye to him properly.

'The whole family has been torn apart by this and his death has left a gaping hole in our lives.

'We hope now this is over we can lay Kiwi to rest and begin to have some closure.'

Prosecutor Christopher Hotten QC said 
she spent much of her childhood in care as her alcoholic mother 
struggled to cope, giving her ‘considerable experience of the care 
system’.

Following Keanu’s birth she received 
‘extensive’ support from health and social workers, posing as an 
‘attentive’ mother at parenting classes.

She moved back to her home city of Birmingham when Keanu was 15 months old, starting a relationship with Southerton.

Mr Hotten said Shuttleworth used her 
knowledge of the care system to ‘manipulate social workers, teachers, 
doctors and care professionals to believe that she was a competent and 
caring mother’.

She told staff at the child’s nursery his bruises came 
from bumps or falls.

In December 2010, she took Keanu to hospital with burned feet, which she claimed came from a radiator beside his bed.

She was told police would inspect her home, and texted Southerton to make sure their stories matched up.

A month later, paramedics found the 
boy dead at the flat in the deprived Ward End suburb.

The couple had 
dialled 999, claiming Keanu had had a heart attack.

Mr Hotten told the 
jury Shuttleworth hoped he would ‘get better’ and only called 999 when 
she realised it was hopeless.

Detective Chief Inspector Caroline 
Marsh, who led the investigation for West Midlands Police, said: ‘In the
 past, I have described her as a monster and perhaps I would stand by 
that.’

The force would not comment on its prior involvement in the case because of the review.
