A woman accused of starting a fire 
which killed five members of a family had previously made threats to 
'burn down' the home of a supposed love rival, a court has heard.

Giving evidence at Mold Crown Court 
today, Samantha Schofield told the jury she had been warned that Melanie
Smith, 42, had threatened to burn her house down.

Smith wrongly believed Miss 
Schofield, the mother of two young boys, was having an affair with her 
partner Steve Clarkson, Miss Schofield said.

Blaze victims: Liam Timbrell with Lee-Anna Shiers and their baby Charlie shortly after his birth. All three of them died in the fire

Allen, four, who were killed in the fire in the first-floor flat in 
Prestatyn, North Wales

Fire deaths: Lee-Anna Shiers, 20, and her 15-month-old son Charlie were both killed following the blaze

She added: 'The night of the fire, it shouldn’t have been that house, it should have been my home.

'People were telling me, my sister told me - Mel said she was planning to burn my house down.

'But I didn’t think she was capable of doing it.'

Lee-Anna Shiers, 20, her 
four-year-old nephew Bailey and two-year-old niece Skye died in the 
blaze in Maes y Groes, Prestatyn on October 19.

Giving evidence at Mold Crown Court today, Samantha Schofield told the jury she had been warned that Melanie Smith (pictured centre), 42, had threatened to burn her house down. Smith wrongly believed Miss Schofield, the mother of two young boys, was having an affair with her partner Steve Clarkson, Miss Schofield said

Firefighters managed to rescue Ms 
Shiers’ 15-month-old son Charlie and his father, Liam Timbrell, 23, from
their first-floor flat but they both later died in hospital.

Smith, 42, who lived in the flat below the victims, denies five counts of murder.

The prosecution say she deliberately 
set fire to a pushchair because she was angry that Ms Shiers had left 
it in a shared hallway.

Smith shook her head and occasionally wiped a tear from her eyes as Miss Schofield gave evidence today.

The witness said that about six weeks
before the fatal fire, she had allowed Mr Clarkson to stay at her home 
when he had temporarily split up with the defendant.

During this time, she got up one 
morning and found that his car, which was parked on her driveway, had 
been vandalised and matches were left strewn around the vehicle.

Questioned by Ian Murphy QC, for the 
prosecution, she said: 'Matches were scattered everywhere and the box 
was placed under the car.

'There were about 20 or 30 matches on the driveway and some more matches still in the box.

'Some were still live and others had been burned.

'I left the matches on the ground but picked up the box and put it in the bin.'

Miss Schofield said she hadn’t seen 
who did it but later that day her sister, Amy, said Smith had told her 
'she planned to burn my house down'.

Asked by Stephen Riordan QC, 
defending Smith, why she never reported the matter to police, the 
witness said: 'I never thought she was capable of doing it.'

The barrister suggested Miss Schofield 'hated' Smith for accusing her of having a relationship with Mr Clarkson.

He went on: 'As soon as the fire 
happened, and you knew the defendant had been arrested, you went to the 
police to make it worse for her.'

Miss Schofield replied: 'No, I thought, "Oh my God", I went to the police because I wanted to help.'

Earlier, the seven women and five men of the jury visited Maes y Groes to see the remains of the property.

They also heard evidence from Norma Vaughan, the landlady of the Royal Victoria pub in Prestatyn.

She told the jury of an incident in 
2008 when Smith, who had been banned from the pub, returned to the 
premises and made an arson threat when she was refused entry.

Mrs Vaughan, the chairman of the 
Prestatyn Pub Watch scheme, told the jury: 'I said, "sorry you can’t 
come in", and with that she said, "I’ll torch this f****** place".'
