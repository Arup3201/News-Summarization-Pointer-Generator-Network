Transgendered men have been in a limbo of sorts for years, identifying with males and looking like them, but having the sexual organs of - and needing treatment for - the female reproductive system.

Because of these dilemmas, many female-to-male transgender have postponed going to the doctor to avoid being the subject of belittling, unprofessional conduct from both doctors and nurses, and in two per cent of cases, violence and physical harassment from staff.

But a board focusing on female health is hoping to change all that by advising OB/GYNs across the country to create a more accepting environment for the community.

Common bond: Both Chaz Bono (left) and Rajee Narinesingh (right) are members of the transgender community. Some are afraid to go to a doctor for fear of discrimination or ridicule

The Sun-Sentinel has reported at the case of transgender couple S.F. Makalani-MaHee, who was born as a female but lives as a male, and his partner Rajee Narinesingh, a transgendered woman.

Mr Makalani-MaHee told the paper that he always felt a sense of dread when going to the gynaecologist, he still has a woman’s sexual organs, which brings a slew of uncomfortable emotions from many doctors.

‘The ignorance runs its course,’ he said. ‘A lot of us have avoided these types of experiences.’

Mr Makalani-MaHee has avoided them by not going to a gynaecologist in more than a decade.

His partner, 44-year-old Rajindra Narinesingh, too, has been on the receiving end of discrimination.

She has gotten her estrogen injections from a general practitioner rather than a gynaecologist.

Daddy dearest: Thomas Beatie, a transgender man with a woman's reproductive organs, was refused treatment from no less than eight doctors

She told the paper she wanted to complete her transformation to a woman by getting gender reassignment surgery.

She’s put it off in part because of the cost, but said she’s also afraid of being discriminated against.

According to the Sun-Sentinel, nearly 30 per cent of the transgender community delays treatment because they fear discrimination.

The community makes up around three per cent of the U.S. population – around 9million Americans.

'By increasing the number of OB/GYNs 
providing care to transgender patients, we can help improve the overall 
health of the transgender community.'

-Dr Eliza Buyers

Seeing the obvious dangers in patient’s health, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has been making strides to improve access to health care.

The College Committee on Health Care for Underserved Women helped develop new curriculum for what they call ‘a small though substantial population.’

They recognise the word transgender is an umbrella term ‘that includes people whose gender identity and/or gender expression differs from their assigned sex at birth.

Winds of change: Dr Eliza Buyers says it's time for the transgender community to feel comfortable going to the doctor

‘Female-to-male, male-to-female, 
cross-dresses, bi-gendered, and intersex are the major groups that fall 
under the term transgender,’ the report said.

The goal is to increase available care to transgendered people.

Dr Eliza Buyers, a former member of the committee, said: ‘It would be wonderful if all transgender patients had the resources to be seen in a specialised clinic, but the reality is that many forgo care because they don’t.

She continued: ‘By increasing the number of OB/GYNs providing care to transgender patients, we can help improve the overall health of the transgender community.’

In many cases, she said, men may need breast cancer and cervical cancer screenings if they take estrogen or had sexual reassignment surgery.

Transgender friendly: Dr Buyers suggests one way to help transgender patients feel more at ease is to create more unisex waiting rooms

For female-to-male patients who haven’t had surgery, reproductive organ screenings of their breasts, ovaries, and uterus are required.

Dr Buyers said that all transgender individuals should have access to STI screenings, Pap smears, and other routine procedures as well.

‘We need to make our offices settings that treat all patients with respect,’ Dr Buyers said. ‘We want the transgender community to know that we, as OB/GYNs, care about their health.’

Some offices are making their waiting rooms more transgender friendly and adding inclusive questions to medical histories.

Even so, board-certified methods for treating transgender patients are still a little-explored area. In 2008, the 'pregnant man' Thomas Beatie case caused shouts and murmurs across the country.

A pregnant Mr Beatie told Oprah: ‘I actually opted not to do anything to my reproductive organs because I wanted to have a child one day. I see pregnancy as a process and it doesn’t define who I am.’

He called the desire to have a child as ‘a human need,’ not an intrinsically male or female function.

He and his wife searched far and wide for a doctor who would help Mr Beatie through his pregnancy. They were turned away by eight different doctors before finding one who would take their case.

Dr Kimberly James told Oprah in 2008 that the baby was healthy, despite the unique fact that Mr Beatie had been taking testosterone supplements for years.

A family affair: Chaz (right) said his mother Cher finally accepted that he was a man

She said: ‘This is what I consider a normal pregnancy.’

A genetic woman who identifies as a man usually receives methyltestosterone injections every two weeks to suppress menses and bring on male secondary sex characteristics, like facial hair and a deeper voice, according to ACOG.

Doctors urge these patients still be screened for breast and cervical cancer unless they have been removed.

In male-to-female cases, patients receive oestrogen therapy, and as a result, they lose body hair, redistribute body fat, and reduced testicular volume. The patient should be screened for both breast and prostate cancers.

OB/GYNs are urged to provide comprehensive medical care to transsexual patients as well.

One celebrity who has publicly undergone gender reassignment is Chaz Bono, who started his transformation in 2009.

While he was public about having his breasts removed, he told Time last May he wouldn’t divulge whether or not he had ‘bottom surgery,’ and adding ‘I like to keep my privates private.’

But the 42-year-old son of Cher and Sonny Bono said in the upcoming January 19 issue of Rolling Stone that he’s 'saving up to buy a penis', making him one of the many men who would need to visit a gynecologist.

He says he’s leaning towards a metoidioplasty – a procedure that enhances the clitoris to make it function more like a penis.

He says the procedure is ‘like a car' as there are many makes and models.

Another reason to look into it? ‘It’s not that big a deal to sit down, but some of the toilet seats in men’s rooms are disgusting.’
