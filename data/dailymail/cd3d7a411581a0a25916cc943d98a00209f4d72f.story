A Texan man is hoping a picture of him and two cute dogs will overtake Ellen DeGeneres' Oscars selfie that 'broke Twitter' as the most retweeted post on the site.

Terry Shipman, 66, posted the photo of himself at home with his two dogs, Oreo and Max, on Tuesday afternoon and it has already earned 117,000 retweets.

The civil engineer from Beaumont, Texas, still has a long way to go to surpass Ellen, whose picture of her at the Oscars with Bradley Cooper, Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Channing Tatum, Jennifer Lawrence, Jared Leto, Meryl Streep, Kevin Spacey, Julia Roberts, Lupita and Peter Nyong’o has been retweeted 3.2 million times.

He it trying to surpass Ellen DeGeneres' Oscars selfie with Bradley Cooper, Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Channing Tatum, Jennifer Lawrence, Jared Leto, Meryl Streep, Kevin Spacey, Julia Roberts, Lupita and Peter Nyong¿o which has been retweeted 3.2 million times.

Within 45 minutes of posting, Ellen's selfie received more than 1 million retweets, and thanks to the amount of Twitter traffic it generated, the social networking site crashed during the ceremony.

Before tweeting his own selfie Mr Shipman had just 20 followers and had tweeted just twice. In the caption of the picture, he wrote: 'Let's see if we can beat the Oscar re-tweets.'

Nine hours later it had been retweeted 32,000 times and he had gained thousands of followers.

His daughter Laura Shipman told Business Insider her dad is always taking photos of him and the dogs and putting them on Facebook but rarely uses Twitter.

The 21-year-old Texas A&M student said: 'He tweeted my brother after he put it up, and he was like, "retweet my picture". We thought it was cute.

'He's not really into Twitter but 
he definitely got the joke about Ellen's Oscar selfie.'

The picture has become the most retweeted photograph ever, beating the record held by President Obama for his 'four more years' tweet after winning reelection

Ellen's tweet gained so much attention Simpsons creator Matt Groening decided to make his own version

She added that although her dad didn't really understand how it had happened he was excited and overwhelmed to become a viral sensation overnight.

Laura also denied the post was a prank by television host Jimmy Kimmel similar to the twerking girl who lit herself on fire.

She went on: 'My
 dad was so offended that I told him people were wondering if it was 
fake, I promise, Jimmy Kimmel has nothing
 to do with this.'

His son Mike, also a Texas A&M student, said: 'This is my dad. He never gets on Twitter and the one picture he 
tweets goes viral.

'While he might not get to 3 million retweets the 
number should continue to increase with all the love and support he is 
getting.'

The popularity of Ellen's tweet produced a host of memes and saw Simpsons creator Matt Groening produce his own version showing why Homer missed out on being in the selfie.

The record for most re-tweeted tweet had been held by President Barack Obama whose “Four more years” message posted on the night of his re-election was retweeted 778,000 times.
