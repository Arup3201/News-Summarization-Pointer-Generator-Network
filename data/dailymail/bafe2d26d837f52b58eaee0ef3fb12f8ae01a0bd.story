It has been almost four decades since the book was closed on his final case.

But as his fans know, it’s not like Hercule Poirot to leave matters alone when there is an intriguing mystery to be solved.

Some
37 years after the death of his creator Agatha Christie, it seems the 
much-loved detective is ready to spring back into action.

Cambridge-based crime fiction writer Sophie Hannah, left, is to write a new novel with the permission of Agacha Christie's family. She became an 'obsessive' Christie fan at the age of 13 when she collected and read all her novels within a year. Right, David Suchet as the riddle-solver Poirot

The eccentric riddle-solver is to feature in a new novel, written with the permission of the late author’s family.

Crime fiction writer Sophie Hannah won their trust after explaining her love of Christie’s novels.

Publishers
HarperCollins are keeping tight-lipped about the plot for the book, 
which will be published in September next year and is as yet untitled.

Although
Poirot is killed off by a heart attack as he solves his last mystery by
Christie, Hannah plans to resurrect him in a tale that she claims will 
be just as intriguing as its predecessors.

‘I hope to create a puzzle that will confound and frustrate the incomparable Hercule Poirot for at least a good few chapters,’ she said.

Agatha
Christie created Hercule Poirot towards the end of the First World War,
when she was serving in the Volunary Aid Detatchment.Described
as a former shining light in the Belgian police, he was inspired by 
refugees from the country which Christie observed in Torquay, Devon.

The
character featured in her first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles,
in 1920, but it was after the publication of The Murder of Roger 
Ackroyd, in 1926, that the nation took him to their hearts.

Known
for his waxed moustaches, perfectionism and ‘little grey cells’, Poirot
became one of the most famous characters of all time.

It
is said Christie never imaged how popular Poirot would become, and by 
1930 she was becoming sick of him, describing him as ‘insufferable’.

But the author insisted it was her duty to continue writing the novels because they had become so well-loved by the public.

On
publication of Curtain: Poirot’s Last Case, the detective was the only 
fictional character to be given an obituary on the front page of The New
York Times.

The Cambridge-based writer and poet 
said she became an ‘obsessive’ Christie fan at the age of 13, when she 
collected and read all her novels within a year.

‘It
was Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple who, between them, made me want to 
devote my working life to crime fiction, and it was Christie’s brilliant
plotting and deep understanding of the human psyche that shaped my 
identity as a crime writer,’ she added.

‘It
is almost impossible to put into words how honoured I am to have been 
entrusted with this amazing project – in fact, I still can’t quite 
believe that this is really happening.

The
first ever Christie continuation novel will be authorised by Acorn 
Productions Limited, which manages the rights to her work.

The
author’s grandson Mathew Prichard said: ‘It was pure serendipity that 
led to Sophie Hannah being commissioned. ‘Her agent happened to approach
HarperCollins in exactly the same week that my colleagues and I had 
started discussing a new Christie book.

‘Her idea for a plot line was so 
compelling and her passion for my grandmother’s work so strong, that we 
felt that the time was right for a new Christie to be written.’

Christie wrote her first Poirot novel,
The Mysterious Affair at Styles, in 1916, and another 32 followed. She 
killed off the Belgian detective, famously played on TV by David Suchet,
in the final book – Curtain: Poirot’s Last Case.

It
was penned in the 1940s, but Christie locked it up until 1975 – the 
year before her death – when she realised she was too frail to write. 
More than two billion of the author’s books have now been sold and many 
were adapted for the stage, television and film.

Poirot
is not the first fictional character to live again – a new Jeeves and 
Wooster novel is due out this year written by Sebastian Faulks, who is 
one of several writers to pen a James Bond novel.
