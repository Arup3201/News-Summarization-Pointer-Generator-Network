A group of workmen who panicked when a colleague fell to his death from a ladder, picked up his body, put it in their van and drove off into the country where they dumped the corpse, a coroner has heard.

The builders had been working in a house in Cox Green, Maidenhead, on January 24 last year when it turned bitterly cold and decided to go to the shop to buy a bottle of vodka each.

After downing the spirits at the building site, Ryszard Karpuc tried to climb down a ladder but fell, landing on his chest, breaking numerous ribs which punctured his lung. He died almost immediately.

The inquest into Mr Karpuc's death heard that his colleagues then panicked, put his body in their van and drove off towards the countryside.

However, the van became stuck, so the men took out the body and left it in nearby woodland.

It was discovered four days later on Wooburn Common, near Beaconsfield, by a shooting party including Lord Burnham, the seventh Baron of Burnham and the son of
Hugh Lawson, who was general manager and deputy manager of the Daily 
Telegraph in the 1970s and 80s, as well Chief Whip in the House of 
Lords.

Speaking at the inquest in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, Detective Sergeant Paul Quinton said: 'The weather was particularly foul and to keep warm they all decided to drink neat vodka.

'Over the course of the day the deceased and his work colleagues purchased a bottle of vodka each from a local store and shared the contents amongst themselves.

'This is believed to have resulted in high levels of intoxication.'

As the men prepared to finish work for the evening Mr Karpuc came down the ladder, because the stairs had not yet been built, but fell and sustained fatal injuries to his chest.

He broke a number of ribs, which punctured his lungs leading to a very sudden death.

His colleagues could find no pulse and concluded that he had died - although they did not call the emergency services.

'They decided to place Mr Karpuc in a van and drive him away from the site,' said Det. Sgt. Quinton.

'It would appear that while driving down a single track road, Green Common Lane, Beaconsfield, the person driving the van tried to turn around.

'This resulted in the Mercedes Sprinter-type van being stuck between the raised banks on either side of the road, it was wedged firmly bank-to-bank.

'It's understood they decided to remove Mr Karpuc from the van and place him on the edge of a forest, so to speak. They then left the scene.'

On January 28, Simon Hanbury and Lord Harry were on a shooting trip and were beating though Green Common Lane when Mr Hanbury noticed what he thought was a body.

As he had his children with him, Lord Harry went to investigate further and came across Mr Karpuc.

'Lord Burnham notified the police via 999 and a number of police officers, paramedics and an air ambulance attended,' said Det. Sgt. Quinton.

Mr Karpuc was pronounced dead at the scene and a post mortem examination revealed that he had suffered an intrapulmonary haemorrhage in the presence of alcohol following a fall from height.

A toxicology report showed he had 284mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood, around three-and-a-half times the drink-drive limit of 80mg.

Karen Morris, a health and safety expert who investigated the death, said that Mr Karpuc had been working with his colleagues, who were also Polish, since the end of July 2012.

'Once the death occurred, Ryszard Karpuc's colleagues appeared to panic and decided it would be best to move his body,' she said.

'They decided to take the body into the country and leave it there.'

Ms Morris said that Mr Karpuc, of Seaford Road, Ealing, had fallen around two metres.

She said that supervisor Michael O'Heney had been away from the site, and had not known that his workers had been drinking - or what had happened to Mr Karpuc.

'He is very shocked by this, I have no reason to believe Mr O'Heney knew there was drinking on his site, I don't think it was a regular occurrence and there is no suggestion he was condoning this behaviour," she said.

A jury of seven women and four men recorded a verdict of accidental death.

The hearing was also told that Mr Karpuc's
colleagues, who were not named, are the subject of legal proceedings 
due to be heard at Reading Crown Court.

They have been charged with obstructing a coroner.

'There are proceedings against several individuals, workmates of Mr Karpuc, who are charged not in relation to causing his death but in what happened subsequently to his body,' said coroner Richard Hulett.

'The offence is failing to report his death to a district coroner.'

Verdict: accidental death.
