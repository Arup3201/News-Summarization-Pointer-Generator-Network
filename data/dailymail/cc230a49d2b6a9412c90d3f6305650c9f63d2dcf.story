Two teenagers from the same school were killed  after stepping in front of a high-speed train in an apparent suicide pact.

Charleigh Disbrey, 15, and Mert Karaoglan, 18, were found on the tracks near a busy commuter station in Hertfordshire.

They were under the arches of a brick footbridge when they were hit by a locomotive travelling at more than 90mph.

Double tragedy: Charleigh Disbrey, 15 (left), and Mert Karaoglan, 18 (right), both died after being hit by a train close to Elstree and Borehamwood station

Victim: Charleigh Disbrey, 15, died after being hit by a train close to 
Elstree and Borehamwood station along with an 18-year-old

Floral tributes: A row of bouquets of flowers left for Charleigh Disbrey and Mert Karaoglan in Borehamwood

Investigators later found two notes on
the body of Mert, a filmmaker and A-level student, and a single note on
Charleigh, a talented musician who said she 'would give anything to be 
famous'.

Charleigh, also known as 'CJ' had 
auditioned for the television shows Britain's Got Talent and Must Be The
Music. The GCSE pupil had posted videos of herself on YouTube playing 
an acoustic guitar and had written on her website that she wanted to 
become a musician 'to be remembered'. 

Just days before her death she had uploaded a haunting rendition of herself singing the David Guetta hit song Titanium.

Friends said the pair, who attended 
Hertswood Academy in Borehamwood, 'were close' but did not believe they 
were in a relationship.

School pupils: Charleigh, left, who was a talented musician, and Mert, right, both went to the same school

Mert Karaoglan was discovered dead on the railway line by paramedics who were unable to help him

Tribute: Flowers are left outside the gates of Hertswood Academy, in 
Borehamwood, after Mert and Charleigh were hit by a train

Mert's parents Hatice, 52, and Sukru, 
48, who are believed to originate from Turkey, were last night too upset
to speak about the tragedy.

The couple told friends: 'He was a happy guy. We don't know who Charleigh was, we don't know why this has happened.'

It is believed the teenagers had clambered over a gate to get on to the tracks.

Tribute: A note to 'CJ and Mert' left on a bouquet of flowers at the scene where the two teenagers died

Tributes: Two bouquets of flowers left near the scene for the school pupils who studied at Elstree and Borehamwood station

Floral tributes: More flowers which were left outside the gates of Hertswood Academy. The teenagers' headteacher described them as 'talented, hard-working and well-respected'

Grief: Tributes left outside the school for the two teenagers. The deaths were announced in a special assembly

They were struck at about 9pm on Monday by a London First Capital Connect service. No passengers were on board.

A Network Rail source said: 'They stepped out together on to the track. Three notes were found on their bodies.'

The incident is not being treated as suspicious by British Transport Police.

A friend said: 'CJ sang and wrote her 
own songs. She was a talented girl, she came across as very happy. She 
was always caring about other people. We didn't know if they were going 
out together but they were close friends. Mert was very talented with 
the camera.'

Tragedy: The two teenagers died after being hit by a train just outside Elstree and Borehamwood station

School pupils: The two teenagers, who were in Year 13 and Year 10, went to Hertswood Academy in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire

Important notice: Message published on the Hertswood Academy website where both the teenagers went to school

Double death: Paramedics were called to the railway line close to this 
bridge but there was nothing they could do to help the 
teenagers
