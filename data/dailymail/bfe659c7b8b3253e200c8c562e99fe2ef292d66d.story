'World's most arrested man': Henry Earl has been arrested more than 1,500 times since 1970. Above, his most recent mugshot from a public intoxication arrest in early October

Henry Earl spent Thanksgiving at home - which is to say, in jail.

The 65-year-old Kentucky man deemed the 'World's Most Arrested Man' by The Smoking Gun with a rap sheet of over 1,500 arrests, found himself back in jail after a public intoxication arrest last month.

In fact it's the third time in the past five years that Earl has been in lock up for the holiday.

In fact most of Earl's arrests have relate to public intoxication, so perhaps it was good he celebrated the holiday in a sober environment.

'He is somewhat of a superstar in his own little world,' Fayette County Detention Center Officer John Casey told ABCNews.com.

Earl's arrest history goes as far back as July 1970 when he was in his twenties for carrying a concealed weapon.He would go on to be arrested 33 more times that decade.

Since then, Earl has been gradually increasing his frequency of arrests.

In the 1980s, Earl picked up the pace with 230 arrests, most due to public drunkenness or disorderly conduct.

But it wasn't until 2008, that Earl gained national attention when he found himself in court for his 1000th arrest for public intoxication.

Judge Gary Payne made it an occasion by sentencing Earl to 1000 days in jail 'for your anniversary'.

While Judge Payne was under the impression that it was Earl's 1,000th arrest, The Smoking Gun later discovered that it was actually number 1,333.Â 

The man with many mugshots: Earl never takes the same mugshot twice, as evidenced in the above collage from just a few of his arrests in Kentucky
