The Queen is used to being the most stylish person in the room.

But when she met the Mongolian ambassador yesterday, she may have felt a little under-dressed.

His Excellency Mr Tulga Narkhuu was given an audience at Buckingham Palace, as is customary when a newly-appointed ambassador or high commissioner arrives in the capital.

His Excellency Mr Narkhuu Tulga of Mongolia was presented with his Letters of Credence as Ambassador, by the Queen at Buckingham Palace

He presented his Letters of Credence in traditional dress, with his bright royal blue outfit drawing the eye from Her Majesty's rather muted mauve

His dazzling deel – a traditional Mongolian double-breasted overcoat – was complemented by a matching hat and leather boots.

Mr Narkhuu, who was educated at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, is fluent in English, Russian and Chinese.

He became Mongolia’s ambassador to the UK in June, having previously held posts in China, Singapore and the US.

The Queen also met with Ed Parker (right), co-Founder of Walking with the Wounded and team mentor of Team USA

The Walking With The Wounded teams are making their final preparations for the 200-mile (322km) expedition before they set off on Sunday. Harry, 29, a captain in the British Army, will race with the UK team of injured soldiers

The Queen also spent yesterday meeting injured members of the Armed Forces who are about to set off for a race to the South Pole.

Prince Harry will be among the three teams raising money for the charity Walking With The Wounded.

Actor Dominic West will be part of a Commonwealth team, racing the prince’s British group and others from the United States.

The squads are currently making their final preparations for their 200-mile expedition, which begins on Sunday.
