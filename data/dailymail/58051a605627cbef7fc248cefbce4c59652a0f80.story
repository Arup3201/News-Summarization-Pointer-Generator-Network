She may once have dreamed of San Pedro, but nowadays Madonna's heart is set on the vibrant city of Tel Aviv - as, it seems, is Natalie Portman's.

The stars have been wowed by a new uber-modern development, Meier-on-Rothschild Tower, in Israel, which features glass walls and panoramic sea views.

When the development was first announced in 2013, Madonna was pictured clutching a brochure for the development - and now the project is nearing completion, the star is reported to have reopened discussions of a purchase.

The stars have been all been wowed by this new uber-modern development in Israel's famous city

Tel Aviv is currently experience a property boom, which experts link to its thriving technology industry - the tiny country has the highest density of tech start-ups in the world

The computer-generated graphics, which Madonna will have seen in her brochure, show glass walls, double-height ceilings and panoramic views of the city.

From the top of her tower, Madonna would be able to see the city's main beach-front promenade - filled with joggers, buggies and the city's version of Boris bikes by day and bustling bars by night.

The iconic 42-storey Meier-on-Rothschild Tower has been designed by Pritzker prize-winning architect Richard Meier whose previous achievements include the Barcelona Museum of Art and the Getty Centre in Los Angeles.

This latest creation is another example of American-born Meier's modernist designs and was recently chosen by Forbes as one of the world's tallest luxury residential towers.

The 590ft-high glass, steel and white aluminum-clad block holds 141 apartments and penthouses, with private terraces.

Privacy is certainly one thing you don't have to worry about when you're 42 storeys high, which is perhaps what's attracted the stars to this particular development.

As a follower of Kabbalah,  Madonna (also known as Esther) has a spiritual link to Israel, so it's no surprise she's looking for a holiday home on its sandy shores.

Back in 2012 she chose Tel Aviv to kick off her world tour and has repeatedly declared in concert that she's 'in love with Israel'.

She's even hobnobbed with the Israeli politicians and reportedly impressed international statesman Shimon Peres when she started speaking to him in Hebrew. 

According to a source close to the project,  Israeli-born Natalie Portman has registered her interest too.

Oscar-winning Portman moved to America from Israel at the age of three, but two decades later after graduating from Harvard, she returned to her country of birth for a stint at Jerusalem's Hebrew University.

The largest penthouse in the tower is on sale for £36million and is named the Palace in the Sky.

The 15,263sqft of luxurious living space features a private elevator, huge entertaining areas, a 12-seater dining room, a large kitchen/breakfast room and two terraces.

All the reception rooms have spectacular Mediterranean views, double-height 22ft-high ceilings and an expanse of floor to ceiling glazing on two sides.

Other features include a private gym, cocktail bar, cinema and mini-spa.

On the upper level are the luxurious bedroom suites, each with walk-in dressing rooms and bathrooms.

The master bedroom suite has expanses of floor to ceiling glazing and also glass feature walls looking into the atrium space formed by the double-height reception.

And of course no £36 million apartment is complete without a private outdoor swimming pool.

Yigal Zemah, Chief Executive Officer at Berggruen Residential, who developed the tower, said: 'At Meier on Rothschild, we have created art through architecture'

Yigal Zemah, Chief Executive Officer at Berggruen Residential, who developed the tower, said: 'At Meier on Rothschild, we have created art through architecture. 

'The Tower has been created with expert craftsmanship and is in a prime location. All of these elements are why it has proven so desirable.'

The tiny country has the highest density of tech start-ups in the world, which attracts more venture capital investment per-capita than any other country.

Being a hotbed for technology and innovation has also attracted global companies including Intel, Google, IBM and Microsoft, to set up research and development centres.

But no doubt if Madonna sets her sights on this breathtaking glass apartment, the Material Girl will manage to see off competition from the city's exploding population of computer geeks.

 There's no excuse not to exercise with a gym like this in your pad
