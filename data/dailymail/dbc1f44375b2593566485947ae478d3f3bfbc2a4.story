Militant Islamists on Egypt's Sinai Peninsula appear to have threatened tourists saying they should leave 'before it's too late'.

The warning came after three South Koreans and a driver were killed in an bomb attack on a bus on Sunday in Taba, near the border with Israel.

In an statement posted on militant 
websites, Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, Arabic for 
Champions of Jerusalem, said late last night that one of its 'heroes' carried out the 
bombing.

The group said: 
'God helped your brothers in Ansar Beit al-Maqdis to assign one of its 
heroes to blow up the tourist bus that was heading to the Zionist entity
 (Israel) as part of our economic war attacks on this traitorous 
hireling regime, which plundered the nation's wealth,' the statement 
said.

Egyptian officials have called the attack a suicide bombing, but the statement did not contain the usual phrasing, such as the word 'martyr' or 'God bless his soul' used in previous claims for attacks in which the bomber also died.

The statement lashed out at intensified Egyptian military operations in the Sinai Peninsula along the border with Israel targeting the militants' hideouts and vehicles.

The Egyptian regime is 'killing 
innocent people, imprisoning women, demolishing their houses, looting 
their properties and flattening the lands at the border with Zionist 
enemy as well as displacing their owners merely to please their Jewish 
masters and protect their alleged borders,' it said.

The
 Al Qaida-inspired group has claimed responsibility for previous 
attacks, but until now they have targeted primarily police and the 
military.

The attacks have spiked after the miitary's 2013 overthrow of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi, spreading to cities of the Nile Delta and the capital, Cairo.

The group claimed responsibility for downing a military helicopter in Sinai in late January, killing all five crew members and the assassination earlier this month of a senior interior ministry aide and carried out a powerful truck bomb outside Cairo's main security directorate.

The authenticity of the statement could not be verified but it was posted on Al Qaida-affiliated websites.
