GPs have been paid bonuses to put elderly patients on controversial ‘death lists’ in an attempt to save the NHS money by cutting the number of people who die in hospital.

They have been given £50 a time to draw up ‘end-of-life advanced care plans’ for patients they predict will pass away within a year.

The payments are designed to encourage doctors to start talking about death with elderly and seriously ill patients and to keep a record of where, ideally, they would like to die.

Those behind the ‘yellow folder’ scheme – so named as that is where the care plan forms are kept – insist its main aim is to give patients a  better death.

But critics say it was designed to save money and could result in  people being denied treatment or help. According to documents seen by The Mail on Sunday, a ‘key objective’ of the project, trialled in eastern England, has been ‘to shift the place of death’ away from hospitals so ‘reducing .  .  . healthcare costs’.

Every death that takes place outside of hospital saves the NHS almost £1,000, official calculations show. Average hospital deaths in England costs the NHS £3,065 but those elsewhere cost only £2,107.

Our latest report comes three months after The Mail on Sunday revealed ambulance crews can refuse to take extremely ill people to hospital if they have stated on their care plan they want to die  at home.

Dr Gillian Craig, a retired geriatrician, questioned why GPs were being offered an extra payment for having a difficult conversation.

‘Why should a GP be paid for this conversation, as opposed to any other?’ she said. ‘I feel doctors are paid very well and there should be no extra payments. Anything else is open to abuse and misuse.’

She also feared that patients signing up to die in their own home may unwittingly be ‘closing the door on potentially life-saving hospital treatment’. She explained: ‘A doctor may not realise that, while the person appears to be dying, they actually have a reversible condition.’

The GP bonus scheme rewarded doctors at 41 practices in Ipswich and East Suffolk, who were paid £50 for each care home patient they signed up to an end-of-life plan.

Patients were asked to stipulate where they would like to die, whether they wished to be resuscitated, and what drugs they wanted in their final hours. Ambulance services and out-of-hours doctors’ services were informed.

The family doctors were also asked to sign up elderly people living in their own homes, although they were not paid the £50 bonus in these cases. The ‘pilot’ project ran for two years from July 2011 to this September and was deemed ‘successful’.

Ipswich and East Suffolk Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), which ran the scheme, has refused to say how much was paid out in total. Stated benefits of the scheme include improving the quality of end-of-life care – but also ‘reducing emergency admissions, length of stay, use of unnecessary treatments and healthcare costs’.

Surveys show that 66 per cent of people would like to end their lives at home, but only 43 per cent do so as most are admitted to hospital.

Dr Anthony Cole, acting chairman of the Medical Ethics Alliance, said: ‘I think it’s got everything to do with money, with the cost of a hospital bed being £200 a day.’ He added there was ‘a real danger’ patients might not realise the choice could lead to them not having medical support in their final days.

A CCG spokesman said: ‘The  purpose of the scheme is to improve end-of-life care, not save money.

Any reductions in hospital expenditure are likely to be balanced by alternative community-based services.

‘The £50 payment to GPs was part of a two-year pilot to raise the profile of the scheme among staff.

The reimbursement reflects the time spent by GPs with a patient and their family to achieve a dignified death.’

Health bosses have been forced into publicising a ‘big brother’ database of medical records, after The Mail on Sunday highlighted serious concerns over the plan.

under the scheme, which Ministers hope will attract drug firms to the UK to help with their research.Health bosses insisted it was not necessary to inform the public directly. Instead, they would rely on doctors telling patients or putting up posters in surgery waiting rooms. But in a climbdown, NHS England will now spend £1.2 million on mailshots to every home in England after MPs criticised the scheme as an ‘enormous threat’.

NHS England insists patient information will always be anonymised before being shared with third parties, such as universities and private companies. It says the project will provide a valuable tool for medical research, monitoring flu outbreaks and screening for common diseases.

But campaigners fear ‘identifiable’ data will be released to the wider NHS and even private firms such as Bupa.

In August, privacy campaigners told this paper there were ‘huge risks’ with putting so much patient information into so many hands.

Last month, we revealed how GPs across the country were threatening to boycott the ‘care.data’ scheme, in part because patients were not being told data would automatically be shared unless they objected. And two weeks ago prominent Tories raised concerns, with MP David Davis describing the scheme as a ‘honeypot of data’ to hackers that was ‘an enormous threat to privacy and patient trust’.

Now, NHS England has bowed to pressure and agreed to send leaflets to all of England’s 22 million homes, while it is also setting up  an £800,000 information line in January.

Patients will then have four weeks to tell their GP surgery if they want to opt out – meaning the actual ‘data extract’ has been delayed from this autumn to next spring.

An NHS England spokeswoman denied it had made a U-turn. ‘We never said there was no need for a national campaign,’ she said.
