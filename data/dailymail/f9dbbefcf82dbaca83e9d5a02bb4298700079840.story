NUT members threaten a mass campaign of non-compliance over new tests for children

Teachers are planning to boycott tests for four-year-olds which they claim will harm children's development.

Members of the National Union of Teachers (NUT) are threatening a mass campaign of non-compliance with the tests, as well as a boycott of a new reading check for six-year-olds.

They have claimed the reforms are 'dangerous' to children's education.

Ministers announced plans last month 
for four-year-olds to be given a 'baseline' assessment in counting and 
letter and picture recognition within weeks of starting in the reception
 class.

The tests are 
intended to measure how well primary schools help their pupils progress 
until they leave at age 11 and expose 'coasting' teachers.

Schools will be able to use the tests from September next year and they will become standard across the system in 2016.

But
 NUT members, meeting in Brighton for their annual conference, will 
today call for the abolition of early testing, claiming it 'creates an 
unhealthy environment of competition' and 'does little but engender a 
feeling of failure in children and pressure on teachers'.

They
 will also call for a return to play-based lessons for children up to 
the age of seven to counter a drive for 'too much  too soon'.

Hazel
 Danson, a member of the NUT's executive and a primary school teacher 
from Huddersfield, said there was a 'groundswell of feeling' against 
testing in early education.

'This notion that you just teach young 
children more stuff earlier and that will somehow improve standards, it 
won't work,' she said.

'I would have every confidence that a ballot on 
this issue would be very strongly supported.'

Schools will be able to use the tests from September next year and they will become standard across the system in 2016

Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw recently launched a scathing attack on the 'middle-class prejudice' that structured learning is damaging for young children, and called for more places for two-year-olds at school-based nurseries.

A spokesman for the Department for Education said: 'We are working with teachers to raise the bar to improve standards in primary schools and introduce a proper measure of progress.'
