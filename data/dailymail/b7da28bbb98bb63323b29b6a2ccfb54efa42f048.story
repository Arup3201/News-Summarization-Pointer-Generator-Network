The British Army fired 46 million bullets at the Taliban during the eight-year Afghanistan conflict at a cost of £200 million in ammunition alone. 

The large amount of ammunition expended during the conflict shows the intense nature of the fighting between British troops and their Taliban opponents. 

According to data released by the Ministry of Defence, some 27 million 5.56 rounds were fired from either the standard SA-80 assault rifle or minimi machine gun.
