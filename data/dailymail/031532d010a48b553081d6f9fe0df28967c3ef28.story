Three death row inmates were last night scheduled to be executed in America despite a row over the use of untested drugs in lethal injections.

The killers are the first scheduled to die since a botched execution in April was caused by an untried cocktail of chemicals.

They are due to be put to death in three states over a 24-hour period but authorities are refusing to say where they have obtained the drugs.

Campaigners have criticised the secretive process under which officials have got hold of drugs from unnamed, loosely regulated pharmacies after other companies withdrew their supplies.

And lawyers for the condemned men say subjecting them to a traumatic ordeal could breach the US constitution’s ban on ‘cruel and unusual punishment’.

However, the killings are due to go ahead unless they are given clemency at the last minute.

Executions in America had been put on hold following the bungled attempt, a highly unusual break for a country that puts more people to death than any other Western nation.

Nine killings were delayed after an inmate eventually died of a heart attack 43 minutes after he was injected with an untested cocktail of drugs in Oklahoma.

An investigation later found that prison guards had put the needle into a vein in Clayton Lockett’s groin but failed to notice when it started leaking, even though he moaned and struggled violently on the gurney.

In January, an Ohio prison also bungled the death of murderer and rapist Dennis McGuire, 53, after using two drugs normally used in colonoscopies.

Marcus Wellons was the first due to die last night in Georgia, followed by John Winfield today in Missouri, although judges have temporarily granted a delay. John Ruthell Henry is set to be put to death tonight in Florida.

Death penalty expert Deborah Denno, of Fordham University School of Law, said that after previous botched executions ‘everyone is going to be watching very closely’.

Richard Dieter, of the Death Penalty Information Center, said the debate could be a ‘turning point’ over capital punishment as people become ‘disgusted’. Georgia and Missouri plan to use the single drug pentobarbital, a sedative, in executions.

Florida uses a combination of midazolam hydrochloride, vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride. Campaigners have challenged the three states’ refusal to divulge where exactly the drugs are from but state courts have ruled the secrecy is legal.

Prisons have had to find alternatives after the makers of sodium thiopental, long used in US executions, stopped supplying it for that purpose in 2011 after being targeted by protesters.
