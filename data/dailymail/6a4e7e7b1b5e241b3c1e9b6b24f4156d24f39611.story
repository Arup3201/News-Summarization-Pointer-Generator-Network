Woolworths has reduced its 24-pack of Homebrand thin sausages to $6.95

In an unexpected move, that can only indicate summer barbeques are in full swing across the country, two supermarket giants have declared a sausage price-war.

Woolworth reduced its 1.8kg 24-pack of Homebrand thin sausages to $6.95 from just under $12 on Friday, bringing the price of each sausage down to 29 cents.

Aldi will now also bring their sausage 24-packs down to $6.89 as of Saturday, according to Fairfax.

All eyes are now on Coles, whose 1.7kg pack of thin sausages so far remains firmly set at $7.

The bulk-sausage price slash comes only a few months after Woolworths led the supermarket giants in lowering its home-brand bread price to 85 cents.

Although met with praise from consumers, the decision was slammed by the Baking Association of Australia and many independent bakeries which feared they would struggle to compete.

Many claimed that it was the quality of full priced products that would save the privately owned businesses, a statement that is likely to be repeated by local butchers in the latest price-war.

Woolworths' head of trading for meat, Jim Stephan, guaranteed that  the latest drop in sausage prices were permanent.

The move has encouraged Aldi to reduce their 24-packs of sausages to as little as $6.89

He told Fairfax that the prices were introduced just in time for Australia day.

'Aussies love their sausages, especially over the summer holidays, so we wanted to help our customers enjoy a great family barbecue that includes ... quality food at a great price,' Mr Stephan said. 

Milk has also been the topic of war for the chains in the last few years, with one litre of milk currently costing only $1.25 in Woolworth and Coles and 85 cents in Aldi.
