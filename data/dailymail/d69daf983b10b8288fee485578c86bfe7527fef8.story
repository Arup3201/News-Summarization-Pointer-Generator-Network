Labour is making a concerted effort to ‘decapitate’ Nick Clegg in next year’s election in order to scupper the chances of a second Liberal-Conservative coalition.

The party thinks it can take the Deputy Prime Minister’s Sheffield Hallam seat after a recent poll gave him only a slim three point lead.

Tom Watson, Ed Miliband’s former election co-ordinator, said: ‘This seat is winnable for Labour.

‘I have never encountered such animosity on the doorstep against an incumbent MP – particularly one as high-profile.

‘There are two issues that come up time and again: his position on tuition fees and Sheffield Forgemasters, which has not been forgotten.’

Mr Clegg was criticised for failing to intervene to stop the cancellation of a Whitehall loan for the heavy engineering company in 2011.

With Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, under pressure in Inverness, Labour hopes the two Lib Dems most closely aligned in government with the Conservatives could lose their seats.

However, a spokesman for Mr Clegg said he was confident of holding the seat, which he took with a commanding 53 per cent of the vote in 2010.

David Cameron is said to believe Labour is trying to remove the Deputy PM to make it more difficult for the Tories to form another coalition with the Lib Dems after the election

‘Obviously it’s going to be a more defensive campaign than it was last time, but Nick is spending at least two days a week there and will continue to do so,’ he said.

Lib Dem strategists point out that the party held on to council seats in Mr Clegg’s constituency in May’s local elections.

David Cameron is said to believe Labour is trying to remove the Deputy PM to make it more difficult for the Tories to form another coalition with the Lib Dems after the election, a Downing Street source told the Times.

The SNP is on course to take a leading role in the Government of the whole of the UK after a poll showed a record number of Scottish voters plan to back the party.

Forty-eight per cent of all voters north of the border now say they will support the Scottish Nationalists at the general election, according to a Survation poll for the Daily Record newspaper.

It prompted speculation that Scotland’s former first minister Alex Salmond, who is to stand for a Westminster seat in May, could become deputy prime minister in a coalition administration.

The poll found Labour is on course to get only 24 per cent of the vote, the Conservatives 16 per cent, the Liberal Democrats 5 per cent and Ukip 4 per cent. The SNP would win as many as 54 of the 59 Scottish constituencies, which would mean it holding the balance of power at Westminster.

Labour’s prospective parliamentary candidate in Sheffield Hallam, Oliver Coppard, has built a strong network of volunteers, according to Mr Watson.

The party is also campaigning hard over the public sector pay freeze and fears about the NHS, claiming Conservative plans to privatise some services risk damaging it as a whole.

The South Yorkshire constituency is said to be dominated by professionals working in the health service and education and last week Mr Clegg said he wanted to ensure the NHS was protected from competition by American health providers.

Mr Clegg has also revealed on his phone-in radio show that he is not planning a new career after the election in May.

But the Deputy Prime Minister said that when he did quit politics he would avoid appearances on reality television shows such as I’m A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here and Strictly Come Dancing.

He also vowed to refuse to enter an unreformed House of Lords as a peer.

Answering questions from youngsters at Sheffield Children’s Hospital for a Christmas phone-in on LBC radio, the Lib Dem leader admitted going to weekly boxing classes after his wife Miriam gave him a pair of gloves last Christmas.

Mr Clegg joked: ‘What I lack in skill I make up for in exertion and enthusiasm.’ He also denied being ‘mates’ with David Cameron, saying: ‘We don’t work together as mates. We’re there to do a job.’
