While many of us might have tried our hand at a miniature model kit we got for Christmas once, few will ever get to these heights.

Matchstick model fanatic Brian Wherry has used an astonishing 1million matches to build versions of famous buildings around the world.

Among the amazing creations in the retired carpenter’s home are the Sydney Opera House, Exeter Cathedral and Liverpool’s Royal Liver Building.

Proud creations: Brian Wherry, 73, is pictured with some of his completed matchstick models, including Exeter Cathedral (left), the Royal Liver Building in Liverpool (right) and the Empire State Building (centre bottom)

Workshop: Some of Mr Wherry's buildings are pictured, including the Leaning Tower of Pisa (centre left), the Eiffel Tower of Paris (behind). He has spent up to 18 months on some of his projects

Australian landmark: The 73-year-old, who buys matchsticks in bags of 10,000, has painstakingly constructed this extraordinary replica of the Sydney Opera House, which took up around 20,000 matchsticks

Mr Wherry, 73, said: ‘It all started when my wife Tina and I went to Austria for a white Christmas.

‘Sadly, they had a big wooden stove 
where we were and it belched out smoke that got on my chest and left me 
in hospital when I came home.

‘I had retired by then but the 
doctors said I couldn’t do anything but rest for six months. I couldn’t 
just sit and do nothing so my stepson bought me a matchstick model kit 
of Big Ben.

'I was hooked. It was only 1,000 
matchsticks, but I had caught the bug and went on from there. Now the 
house is full of my models.’

Mr Wherry buys matchsticks in bags of
10,000 and has used more than 1million of them over the eight years 
that he has been building models.

Comparison: Mr Wherry is pictured (left) with his completed model of the Royal Liver Building, after using 52,000 matches to construct what is an impressive version of the actual building in Liverpool (right)

All angles covered: Mr Wherry shows off his Royal Liver Building from another viewpoint. It stands 3ft high and took 18 months to complete. He chose the building because his stepson Robert was employed there

Master craft: Retired carpenter Mr Wherry believes he has got through more than 1million matchsticks since he started his hobby eight years ago and became 'hooked' after completing a matchstick model kit of Big Ben

Intrinsic detail: Close-ups of Mr Wherry’s versions of Exeter Cathedral (left) and the Royal Liver Building (right) show just how much effort he has put into making the models in his three-bedroom home

The non-smoker, who lives with his 
70-year-old wife Tina in a three-bedroom semi-detached house in Exeter, 
has even spent up to 18 months on some projects.

David Reynolds, from Southampton, has spent more than 10,000 hours gluing 250,000 matches to make a fleet of 20 legendary vessels, including the Titanic and Queen Mary.

The retired oil rig worker also claimed a record in 2009 for creating the world's biggest matchstick model - using four million pieces.

The 54-year-old spent 15 years creating a 12ft tall replica of a North Sea oil platform and invested £5,000 on glue and matchsticks.

He added: ‘It is not so much the 
finished article that counts but the relaxation and therapeutic value I 
get from being so completely involved in a task that requires continued 
concentration. It clears the mind.’

Mr Wherry has also built replicas of London’s Tower Bridge, the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the Eiffel Tower of Paris.

He built the 3ft-tall Royal Liver 
Building out of 52,000 matchsticks, and decided on the project because his stepson Robert works at
the building in Liverpool.

Mr Wherry said: 'We went up to visit 
Robert and Tina said the building should be my next project. I measured 
up the windows and doors and Tina went up on the roof and took 
photographs.

Astonishing work: The two Liver birds on the roof of Royal Liver Building have been recreated in outstanding detail. The bird is the symbol of the city of Liverpool and it is used on Liverpool Football Club's logo

Close study: Mr Wherry's model of Exeter Cathedral was made in tribute to his hometown in Devon, where he lives with his wife Tina, 70

Up close and personal: The Exeter Cathedral model is accompanied in his workshop with versions of London's Tower Bridge and Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris

More than a hobby: Mr Wherry, pictured with a huge bucket of matchsticks, said he enjoys the 'relaxation and therapeutic value' from being so involved in something that requires 'continued concentration'

‘I then made up a plan from that. It took about 18 months to complete, right down to the two Liver birds on the roof.’

In addition to a 6ft model of Tower 
Bridge and a similar-sized version of the Royal Albert Bridge - linking Cornwall and Devon - he 
has also built a Canadian Gold Rush steam train crossing a bridge.

'It is not so much the finished article that counts but the relaxation and therapeutic value I get from being so completely involved in a task that requires continued concentration'

Exeter Cathedral was constructed as a
tribute to his hometown. It took 10 months, 150 hours and 35,500 
matchsticks - including 68 statues on one side.

But while many people might spare a 
thought for his wife Tina, Mr Wherry insisted that she is pleased he has
something with which to pass the time.

He said: ‘Tina loves me to get on 
with my hobby because it leaves her in peace to do her own and she has 
many, including card making, cross stitch, knitting, box making and 
patchwork.'

Mr Wherry is not yet sure what to create for his next matchstick project but Buckingham Palace is a favourite, he said.
