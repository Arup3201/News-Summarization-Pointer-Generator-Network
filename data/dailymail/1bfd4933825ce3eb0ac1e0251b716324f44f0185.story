An aspiring nurse who was out celebrating her birthday the day before she turned 22 has been killed by a drunk driver - just hours before her boyfriend was set to propose.

Taylor McGonigle, from Baker, Louisiana, was with friends in the French Quarter of New Orleans at 5am on Sunday when Tevest Vance smashed into a balcony pole, which fell and struck her head.

Vance, who has a lengthy criminal record and was  on probation for a 2011 felony drugs charge, tried to flee the scene but his car stalled and he was stopped by a passerby, police said.

Officers noted he smelled of alcohol and recorded his blood-alcohol level of .214, which is more than twice the legal limit, the Times-Picayune reported.

Loved: 21-year-old Taylor, pictured with her mother Tina McGonigle, was an only child

McGonigle's friends, who were walking slightly ahead of her, heard the crash and turned around to see her on the ground, her mother said. An autopsy will determine her exact cause of death.

Her boyfriend of three years, Kiara Brown, told the newspaper that he had planned to drive from his home in Lafayette to Baton Rouge the following day to surprise her and propose to her.

The 24-year-old is now planning a funeral for his girlfriend, whom he was looking forward to moving in with next month, he wrote on Facebook.

'We were supposed to conquer the world together,' Brown told the Times-Picayune. 'I was going to propose to her tonight.'

The pair met in 2011 when they were both students at Job Corps, a free career-training program in Carville. where she was studying nursing assistant skills.

McGonigle was an only child and cared for her grandmother, her mother Tina said.

'She had the kindest and most open personality,' her mother said. 'I'm so upset this man was out on (probation) ... and he was out drinking and driving and he murdered an innocent person.'

Vance, 37, was out on probation for his sixth felony conviction at the time of the crash.

Records show he has been arrested 13 times since 1995, including for marijuana distribution in 2009 and for selling crack cocaine in 2011, the Times-Picayune reported.

He was serving five years of probation for the 2011 arrest and was supposed to remain under supervision until July 2018.

'I hope it haunts you for the rest of your life,' Brown said in a message directed at Vance. 'Make no mistake about it: we will get justice for Taylor.'

Vance has been booked into Orleans Parish Prison on a count of vehicular homicide. His bond has been set at $100,000.

He faces up to 30 years in prison if he is convicted.
