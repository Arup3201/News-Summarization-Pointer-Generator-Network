Four in ten brides admit they became 'fiercely competitive' when planning their wedding, research has shown.

A study carried out among 1,000 newly married women has also revealed six in ten chose aspects of their big day just to make theirs better than their friends did.

Many also admitted they'd be 'livid' if a fellow bride-to-be copied her plans, but over a third confessed they had in fact stolen wedding ideas from their own friends.

And having great photos for social media was listed as a big motivator, as three in ten said how their wedding looked on Facebook was one of their prime wedding concerns.

A spokeswoman for online gift retailer GettingPersonal.co.uk, said: 'We all know that a woman's wedding is supposed to be the best day of her life - so of course wanting it to be just right can really build pressure.

'With wedding blogs, social media and the huge furor over celebrity weddings, no wonder a bride-to-be can become overwhelmed with making everything perfect.

Stresses: In addition to competition family politics, the bridesmaids putting on weight and the mother-in-law taking over were listed as most common wedding fears for modern day brides

'But though it's stressful, it's the personal touches that really add that special something to a wedding day, so that everyone can enjoy it as much as the newlyweds.'

The research showed half of all brides have gotten married within the same year as one of their friends, with a quarter who booked their weddings within the same month.

And comparison to other brides-to-be was a big cause of anxiety for the women polled.

One in ten brides said they would be 'livid' if a friend bought the same wedding dress as them and that it was an 'unforgivable' act.

A third also insisted details such as their table settings, the dress designer and general wedding theme had been copied by another engaged friend, including ten per cent who verbally accused a fellow bride of copying her.

Despite this, a similar figure of 36 per cent admitted to copying aspects of other women's weddings they'd either attended or seen on social media.

In addition to competition - family politics, the bridesmaids putting on weight and the mother-in-law taking over were listed as most common wedding fears for modern day brides.

Whilst pressure to look great in photos, a misbehaving best man and worries about the weather also made the list.

Keeping up appearances was a big issue for over a fifth who worried their photographer wouldn't capture them in the best light.

One in ten fretted that their bridesmaids wouldn't be happy on the day, whilst others were anxious they'd wear unsuitable make-up or shoes.

A further 16 per cent were sick with nerves over what the best man would plan during the reception.

And this high level of stress lead to multiple petty arguments, the research showed - in fact, one in twenty said they even made themselves ill in an effort to make their wedding better than anyone had seen before.

Over half fell out with family and friends during the planning process, with the bride's mother and future mother-in-law taking the most blame during feuds.

Disputes over who could be invited to the wedding was a big argument trigger, said the women polled.

Not helping the bride to plan enough was also named as a reason the women became riled, or conversely, if someone tried to butt in and take over the planning.

Many claimed asking the bridesmaids to pay for their own dresses caused bad feeling, whilst one in six brides fell out with somebody who made negative comments over her choices.

The spokeswoman said: 'There's definitely a trend now for every wedding to go one step further than the norm.

'We can see how important this has become to brides on our site as we now sell more personalised wedding favours and accessories than ever before.'
