It is the home where her father is said to have confronted Prince Charles and thundered: 'What are your intentions towards my daughter?'

And now the seven-bedroom former rectory once described by Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall as 'perfect in every way' is on the market for £3.15million.

The Laines, set within five acres on the edge of Plumpton village in East Sussex, has a paddock, wide lawns, a secret garden, a swimming pool and tennis court.

Dating back to the 18th Century, the Grade-II listed home is spread over three floors and even boasts a Gothic style orangery added in the Seventies.

It is only the second time in 63 years that the property has come to the market and was home to Camilla's father Major Bruce Shand for 45 years. 

The former rectory was bought off him by actor James Wilby, best known for his aristocratic roles in Maurice, Gosford Park and A Handful Of Dust, and his wife Shana.

They decided to sell the home in August last year with a guide price of £3.25million, but the couple have now dropped the price.

Camilla has fond memories of the years she spent at the historic property with her siblings Annabel and Mark after the family moved to Sussex  to be near Sonia Cubitt, Camilla’s maternal grandmother. 

It was from here that Camilla, aged four-and-a-half, started out for her first school, Dumbrell’s, before completing her education at Queens Gate School in Kensington and finishing schools in Switzerland and France.

Prince Charles came to visit the house several times, both before Camilla’s marriage and also later while on shore posting at Portsmouth during his Royal Navy service in the early Seventies.

But the majority of the couple's secret assignations were made at Camilla’s grandmother’s home, Hall Place at West Meon.

It was once reported that Major Shand hauled Prince Charles to The Laines to confront him about the intense public scrutiny his daughter was under.

But later it emerged that the husband of one of Camilla’s best friends, Charles Benson, had sold the totally fallacious tale to fund a chronic gambling habit.

At the time, because of the feverish atmosphere surrounding the disclosure of Charles and Camilla’s relationship, the story seemed to have the ring of truth.

Prince Charles has praised the way his wife has tackled the challenge of joining the royal family as ‘brilliant’ ahead of their 10th wedding anniversary next month and it remains to be seen whether he will buy the property.

Since marrying the prince in 2005, Camilla – once one of the most hated women in Britain - has gone from being a middle-aged mother who lived much of her life out of the spotlight, to taking on a range of charitable patronages and learning about the rigours of royal engagements. 

The main rooms of the historic house have high ceilings and large Georgian windows with wonderful views of the garden and Downs. 

A spokesman for agent Strutt and Parker said: 'On the first floor there are seven main bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a shower room. The rooms to the south and east enjoy stunning views of the gardens and South Downs.

'The superb gardens were re-designed by the well-known landscape gardener, Lanning Roper and are a particular feature of the property. They include formal lawns planted with mature trees and shrubs, a magnificent walled kitchen garden, secluded swimming pool area, a rose garden and an orchard.'
