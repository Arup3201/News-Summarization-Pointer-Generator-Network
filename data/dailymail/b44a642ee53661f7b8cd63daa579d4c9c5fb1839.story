For those who lust after the lean, toned limbs of a supermodel, but lack the know-how on how to achieve it, Lara Stone has revealed the -surprisingly simple- moves that she used to bounce back into catwalk shape after childbirth. 

Appearing with her 'guru', Bodyism founder James Duigan in a video for Net-a-Porter's E-magazine The Edit, she praises the 'super gentle' routine he developed for her.

The dutch model, who married Brit actor David Walliams in 2010 speaks candidly in the video about her struggle to lose weight after childbirth.

While showing the moves that helped her regain her figure after childbirth, Lara admits she found the weight loss 'stressful' 

The five moves are designed to provide all over toning and fat burning specifically for those who haven't exercised for some time such as those who have just given birth

Having gained weight while pregnant with the couple's first child Alfred, who was born in May 2013, Lara, 30, admits that like most women, the task of losing the extra pounds was daunting.

'I'd never had to lose a significant amount of weight', Lara explains. 'I found it quiet stressful; this huge mountain of weight to lose.

'You [James] showed me that it wasn't really about that and it was about being a mother and having this beautiful baby. 

The five moves are designed to provide all over toning and fat burning specifically for those who haven't exercised for some time such as those who have just given birth.

The first involves keeping your feet on the floor with your toes up- which engages your glutes- before slowly raising you hips up and squeezing your buttocks. This simple move is repeated about 10 times.

'They are so easy to do anywhere like in a hotel,' Lara says.

James claims the next move, 'The Superman', is the 'supermodel secret to a flat tummy'. 

Involving kneeling on a mat on all fours before extending and retracting the opposite leg and arm simultaneously. 

Other key moves involves the basic squat while inhaling on the way down and exhaling on the way up, and leg lifts using a Bodyism band round the knees to add resistance.

The final move the power pair demonstrate is the 'non surgical boob lift', which involves going into a half squatting position and holding that while fully extending the arms outwards and upwards.

'This really engages all the muscles that are going to lift up your chest,' James explains. 

It is difficult to imagine the notoriously elegant Lara repeating such bizarre looking moves over and over again, but the results were clearly worth it.

Appearing in head-to-toe black lycra Lara shows why she is still one of the most sort-after models in the industry even after giving birth.

Refreshingly, maintaining her supermodel body doesn't seem to have stopped Lara enjoying life.

Last week she was seen out with husband David enjoying dinner at famed restaurant Scott's in London.

Earlier this year, Lara told Harper's Bazaar that one of the things she has in common with her husband is a 'mean' sense of humour. 

'On our very first date, I was so nervous,' she recalled. 'I was in the cab home afterward and thought, I should text him and thank him for dinner. When I did, he texted back, "Who's this?"'

The blonde beauty added that since the birth of their son Alfred in May 2013, she's enjoyed watching her husband gleefully take on daddy duties.

'Just one look and he can put me and Alfred in hysterics,' she said.
