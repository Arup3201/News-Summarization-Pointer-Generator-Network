As George Groves goes before another tribunal, this time at the British Boxing Board of Control, we have to wonder what kind of advice he is receiving. Or if he is listening.

Even when he gets the verdict, the young man who believes he was robbed by Carl Froch still doesn't win. Not financially. Which tends to be what happens when you file a case in which even a victorious outcome cannot deliver the judgement you really want.

Saint George went all the way to New Jersey to ask the IBF to enforce a return fight in the wake of that controversial stoppage by Froch in their world super-middleweight title clash.

Up for the battle: George Groves is petitioning the BBBC to declare his fight with Carl Froch a No Contest

After they bent to his demand, Groves was reminded that as the mandatory challenger he would be entitled to only 15 per cent of the purse.  This after he had turned down a seven figure offer from the Froch camp.

Sorry, said the IBF when he went back to them pleading for something more equitable, they had done all they could.

Now Groves is petitioning the British Board to declare his fight with Froch a No Contest. Since the Board rarely, if ever, come to such a decision – and stood four-square behind their senior referee Howard Foster at the time - it is unlikely that the solitary blemish on Groves' record will be expunged at this Wednesday's meeting.

But even if the Board were to take such action it would not improve his monetary bargaining position. Froch would remain the IBF world champion, as well as holder of the WBA 'regular' title, and still be entitled to 85 per cent of the booty.

Groves might have been better served concentrating on his campaign to encourage the court of public opinion to embarrass Froch into giving him a second shot. His share of a voluntary match would have been greater.

Now it could be economically shrewder for him, not Froch, to be the one who pulls out – for the moment. That would release Froch to defend his titles against Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr – namesake son of the Mexican legend - who enjoys huge Hispanic support in America.

Chavez is preparing for a re-match of
 his own – against Brian Vera - on March 1. If a Chavez victory would be
 likely to put the seal on a Froch deal, the Nottingham Cobra might well
 be at ringside in San Antonio's Alamodome that night.

If
 Froch were to lose in Las Vegas in mid-summer, the domestic rematch 
would still be massive box office at an English football ground later 
this year or early in 2015 – with Groves able to negotiate a purse much 
closer to parity.

In 
the meantime, he can find other ways of cashing in on a reputation much 
enhanced by his performance against Froch. Better that, maybe, than 
shooting himself in the wallet.

Calling the shots: Referee Howard Foster controversially stopped the title bout in the ninth round

Picture that: Tyson Fury mocked David Haye

Tyson Fury kept one critical eye on David Haye even as he finished sparring prior to his fight this Saturday night at the Copper Box in London's Olympic Park. A cut eye.

Fury sustained damage to his left eyebrow while flexing his fists against American stable-mate Eddie Chambers – and could not resist a jibe at Haye for cancelling their Battle of Britain by publishing a photograph of a gash of his own on the same spot.

Fury posted a picture of his wound on Twitter and wrote: 'Look. Should I do a Hayemaker and pull out. P***y. I'm still fighting.'

That was Haye's second withdrawal from facing Fury – having cited a ruptured shoulder first time – but the 6ft 9in Manchester traveller seriously doubts he was injured on either occasion.

With Haye now in semi-retirement, Fury and Dereck Chisora are vying to be become our next Brit home-boy to challenge multi-world heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko.

Chisora tops Saturday's bill, with Fury as the main support. If both big men win they are scheduled to meet at West Ham's football ground in what could be a final eliminator for Klitschko's WBO title.

Fury takes on US slugger Joey Abell – who either knocks out his opponents or gets flattened himself.

Next challenge: Dereck Chisora will face American Kevin Johnson on Saturday

Chisora, who took Wladimir's brother Vitali the full 12 rounds in his one world title fight thus far, appears to have a slightly more complicated task against another American.

Kevin Johnson is an experienced world title-challenging veteran who once lasted the distance against Wladimir. But both should win to set up their midsummer showdown.

Chisora v Johnson, Fury v Abell will be live on BoxNation on Saturday night via Sky Ch. 437 or Virgin Ch. 546.

Now that Floyd Mayweather has had his fun with that Twitter poll, an amusing charade in which he invited the fans to choose his next opponent, we can expect the long-awaited confirmation that the world's No 1 boxer will fight Britain's Amir Khan in Las Vegas on May 3.

For what it was worth, Mayweather's spot of mischief ended with Khan way ahead of Marcos Maidana, the Argentinian hit-man who recently upset Adrien Broner but who has been beaten by Bolton's former Olympic silver medallist. Khan captured almost 60 per cent of the 35,000 votes cast. 

The poll served as useful propaganda to 
help sell the fight on pay-per-view in America, although Mayweather-Khan
 has been in the pipeline since October.

It is being rumoured that Joe Bugner is about to announce a comeback in his Australian homeland – at 63 and 15 years after his last fight.

Bugner took Muhammad Ali the distance twice but upset his British fans when given a narrow decision over the much-loved Henry Cooper. He hung up the gloves in 1999 after defeating Levi Billups.

This smacks of a publicity stunt, or an early April Fool's joke. If not, at two years shy of pensionable age, say it ain't so, Joe.
