Egypt's former military chief has won a crushing victory in the country's presidential elections with more than 92 per cent of the votes.

Early indications suggest field marshal Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi has received 23.38million votes, with left-wing politician Hamdeen Sabahi, his sole opponent, taking 735,285.

But the victory was undermined by a low turnout of only 44 per cent, even though voting was extended
 for a third day in a bid to avoid a political embarrassment.

It is well below the 52 per cent who turned out for the election won by Mohammed Morsi in 2012.

Jubilant: Supporters of Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi celebrate at Tahrir Square in Cairo, Egypt

Al-Sisi's
 win was never in doubt, but the career infantry officer, also 59, had 
hoped for a strong turnout to restore legitimacy after he ousted Morsi, Egypt's first freely elected president, last July. 

After polls closed, his supporters 
held all-night celebrations in Cairo, with several thousands gathered at
 the central Tahrir Square, the focal point of the 2011 uprising that toppled
 longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak.

They
 waved Egyptian flags, posters and danced. There were similar 
celebrations in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria and a string of 
other cities north of the capital.

In his final campaign TV interview 
last week, el-Sissi had set the bar even higher, saying he wanted more 
than 40 million voters - there are nearly 54 million registered -
 to cast ballots to 'show the world' the extent of his support. 

Decisive victory: The former army chief is believed to have won 92 per cent of the ballots cast (around 23.38million votes)

Critics
 said the lack of enthusiasm at the polls was partly due to apathy 
among even el-Sissi supporters, knowing that his victory was a foregone 
conclusion.

Others said
 it showed discontent with el-Sissi, not just among his Islamist foes 
but also among a broader section of the public that believes he has no 
concrete plans and will return to the 
autocratic ways of Mubarak.

The tepid turnout was particularly 
embarrassing because the government and media had been whipping up support for al-Sisi over the past 10 months.

He has been depicted as a 
warrior against terrorism and the only person able to tackle Egypt's 
economic problems, high unemployment, inflation and instability.

Al-Sisi's supporters in the Egyptian 
media have been in a panic the past two days. Political talk show hosts 
and newscasters urged people to vote, warning that a surprise result could see the Muslim Brotherhood step up its challenge to the new 
government.

Prominent TV 
talk show host Amr Adeeb angrily said that by not voting, Egyptians 
might as well 'go directly to the prison and return Mohammed Morsi to 
power.'

The
 abrupt decision by the election commission to add another day of voting
 Wednesday raised complaints that authorities were tipping the playing 
field in el-Sissi's favor.

US-based
 Democracy International, which had been observing the vote, said the 
extension 'raises more questions about the independence of the election 
commission, the impartiality of the government, and the integrity of 
Egypt's electoral process.'

It
 said its observer teams outside of Cairo had ended their mission as 
scheduled on Tuesday. Some other international monitoring teams also 
left the country, since they had only planned for two days of voting, 
though EU monitors stayed on.

Sabahi, al-Sisi's only opponent in the race, protested the extension, saying it aimed to 'distort' the will of the people.

His
 campaign pulled its representatives from polling stations Wednesday in 
protest against what it called a campaign of intimidation and arrests of
 its campaign workers.

He, however, refused to bow to pressure from his 
camp to withdraw in protest, arguing that staying in the race qualifies 
him to 'fight future battles.'

Sabahi's spokesman, Hossam Moenis, told ONTV network that a member of the campaign has been referred to a military tribunal.

'We
 are digging a channel for democracy ... in the face of an undemocratic 
project,' he said. 'The same mentality that we thought we managed to 
topple on Jan. 25, is back and ruling,' - a reference to the start of 
the 18-day, anti-Mubarak uprising in 2011.

Only
 a handful of voters, or none at all, were at polling centers in 
multiple districts toured by Associated Press reporters Wednesday.

At some, music played and kids painted
 Egyptian flags or el-Sissi's name on their faces as the occasional 
voter drifted in. TV images beamed from more than a dozen locations 
across Egypt showed similar scenes.

'People
 are lazy, depressed or frustrated. They knew what the result will be 
even before the vote,' said Amani Fikry, a manager in a privately-owned 
company.

'They are exhausted from three years of constant troubles.'

Victory: More of el-Sissis's faithful gather in the square. Voting was extended to a third day in a bid to avoid an embarrassing turnout

In Cairo's Sayeda Zeinab district, loudspeakers played patriotic songs at an empty polling center. Two al-Sisi backers scribbled words of support on posters of the candidate that had been defaced with insulting graffiti.

'El-Sissi doesn't need a program,' said one, Mohammed Hussein. 'We just want security.'

Morsi's Brotherhood supporters and other Islamists boycotted the vote and scattered protests by Morsi supporters were quickly dispersed by security forces.

In Fayoum, the province southwest of Cairo, riot police fired tear gas after protesters hurled stones and fire cracks while marching and chanting slogans against elections.

Along with Islamists, some of the youths who took part in the 2011 uprising that toppled Mubarak either stayed away from the polls or supported Sabahi.
