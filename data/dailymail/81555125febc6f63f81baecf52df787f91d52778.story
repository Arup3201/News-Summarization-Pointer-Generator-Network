When Lynda Whitehead introduced her new puppy Patch to her family, she didn’t realise quite how much of a führer he would cause.

For while the cute seven-week-old is quiet and cuddly, her daughter spotted his uncanny resemblance to Adolf Hitler.

Now he inspires her grandsons to do the goose-step and even responds to being called Adolf or Hitler.

Spitting image: Hitler (left) and Patch the puppy (right), who has an unfortunate resemblance to the 20th Century dictator, but has a much gentler temperament

A dark mark on his top lip mirrors the Fuhrer's famous moustache. And another large brown area over his left ear completes the look of the 20th Century dictator.

But, according to his owner, the resemblance ends there as Patch - unlike Hitler - has a lovable temperament.

The tiny puppy, a cross between French bulldog and a shih tzu, has two brothers and lives with owner Lynda in York.

She said no-one calls him by his real name any more and Patch is starting to obey orders - as 'Adolf' or 'Hitler'.

Mrs Whitehead said: 'None of us noticed the likeness until we put a photo on Facebook and my eldest daughter saw it and said ‘You've got a little Hitler there".

'Although he's called Patch, everybody calls him Adolf now. My grandsons are the worst for doing the goosestep when the puppy's around.'

Patch's mother Betty, a French bulldog, and father Teddy, a shih tzu, both belong to Mrs Whitehead's daughter Clare, and Patch belongs to Clare's 17-year-old son Dan.

The three puppies in the litter are being reared at the family home until they reach 12 weeks old after Betty rejected them.

Mrs Whitehead added: 'He is a lovely little thing. All of them are, but he is the gentlest of them all. He will sit on your lap and just look at you until he falls asleep.

'One of his brothers should be Hitler as he has the attitude. That one's the runt of the litter so he's had to fight a bit more.'

Patch isn't the only pet that's had an unfortunate resemblance to Hitler.

After MailOnline introduced you to the house that looked like Hitler two years ago, in Swansea, south Wales, a series of readers sent in pictures of their cats that looked like the Nazi dictator.

In 2011, a six-week-old puss was named Kitler 
by staff at Wood Green Animal Shelter in Godmanchester, Cambridgeshire, 
who took her in after she was found abandoned at a roadside.
