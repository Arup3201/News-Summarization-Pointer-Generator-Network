Flood water covered swathes of central and northern Italy today after the region was battered by torrential rain.

Devastating storms caused huge damage
at the weekend, washing out roads and isolating towns in southern 
Tuscany, where four people died as a result of flooding.

Yesterday
one of Rome's most historic bridges was closed as the swollen Tiber 
River roared through the capital and flooded outlying neighbourhoods.

Threat: The level of the Tiber was rising near St Peter's Basilica in Rome today, after four people died in floods caused by heavy rain in Tuscany this week

The Tiber's muddied waters rose to 
fill some of the supporting arches of the Ponte Milvio, or Milvian 
Bridge, threatening to engulf a pedestrian walkway and submerging trees.

The
bridge, the current version of which dates to 1850, marks the spot of a 
previous bridge where in 312 the emperor Constantine defeated his rival 
Maxentius in one of the most pivotal battles of ancient Roman history.

High embankment walls protected the rest of central Rome but the Tiber and Aniene rivers broke their banks north of the city, flooding farmland and parts of smaller towns.

In Rome's northern outskirts, drainage pipes, irrigation canals and sewers backed up, flooding streets that feed into the country's main north-south highway and blocking traffic.

Four people died in southern Tuscany in the wake of rainstorms at the weekend, including three electric company workers whose car fell off a collapsed bridge.

Farmers' lobby Coldiretti said rain, flooding and landslides in central and northern Italy may have caused up to 100 million euros in damage to agriculture.

Torrent: The level of the river Arno, which runs through Florence, is very high. The heavy rains caused the death of four victims in Tuscany, with three of them found in a car

Abandoned: A car is submerged in floodwater in the village of Albinia, central Italy. The floods were caused by a storm over the Adriatic

Storms that hit northern and central Italy at the weekend caused enormous damage. Farmer organisations estimate the damage to agriculture could be 100 million euros

The storms whipped the Adriatic on 
Sunday, causing some of the worst flooding in the past 150 years in the 
lagoon city of Venice. St Mark's Square and other low-lying areas were 
under so much water that some tourists were able to swim there.

Officials said the situation in Venice was returning to normal.

A
section of the main A-1 north-south highway that had been closed 
between the Lazio and Umbria regions was reopened to passenger traffic 
on Wednesday but still closed to heavy vehicles.
