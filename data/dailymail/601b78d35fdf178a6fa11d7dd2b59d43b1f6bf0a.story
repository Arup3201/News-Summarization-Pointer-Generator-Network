Rihanna's poofy pink gown from last night's Grammys has inspired a series of hilarious internet memes.

After the 26-year-old singer deputed her empire-waisted Giambattista Valli dress on the red carpet, it has been compared to everything from a shower loofah to one of Nicki Minaj's wigs. 

While the polarizing gown has earned Rihanna spots on both best and worst dressed lists, her look faced enormous amounts of ridicule on the internet.

Some critics noted that her enormous ruffled gown resembled a doll cake topper, while others compared is to a shower loofah. 

'I'd like to note the fact that @Rihanna looks like the @Barbie cake from my 4th birthday party,' one person tweeted.

The star struggled with her voluminous dress throughout the night and had to continuously pull up the heavy gown, which was adorned with plaited silver embellishments on the top and bottom of its satin bustier.

The star's skin had a bronzed glow and her sleek bun was the perfect coif for her somewhat overwhelming gown.

Rihanna was recently photographed swimming alongside three sand tiger sharks and other sea creatures at the Florida Aquarium in Tampa for the March issue of Harper's Bazaar. 

The cover star told the magazine that she does her 'best to avoid the sharks of life' and noted that her 'thick skin' is what helps her deal with her critics.

'This skin has been developing since my first day at school,' she said. 'It didn’t happen after fame. I couldn’t survive fame if I didn’t already have it.'

Rihanna continued: 'So sometimes the toughest thing in life is to be vulnerable. I’m not generally a sensitive person, but I tend to be more sensitive toward others and what they’re going through. I don’t know if that’s the healthiest thing, but it’s the truth.”
