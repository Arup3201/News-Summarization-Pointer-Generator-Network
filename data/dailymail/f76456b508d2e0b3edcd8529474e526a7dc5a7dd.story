It's sleek, British and wouldn't look out of place in a Bond movie.

Petrolheads will be salivating at the sight of the Speedback - a new luxury sports car which was unveiled today.

Made by David Brown Automotive, the GT was designed and built in Britain, has a bespoke interior and a handcrafted aluminium body.

And although it takes some of its inspiration from the classic Aston Martin DB5, the connection ends there.

David Brown looks on as the finishing touches are applied to  Speedback - the new luxury British sports car made by his company, in Coventry

The car has more than a passing resemblance to an 1960s Aston Martin DB5 (pictured). From the stylish air vents, to the large, circular lights and silver spoked wheels, the Speedback could easily pass for a modern update of James Bond's famous car

When viewed from the front, the Speedback could easily be mistaken for a DB5 thanks to its wide grill and bonnet ventilation

The car's grill, bonnet and front lighting is an almost identical shape to that seen on an 1960s Aston Martin DB5 (pictured). If you saw the Speedback in your rear-view mirror, it would be difficult to tell the two cars apart

Company founder and CEO, David Brown has
 a long-standing background in engineering, vehicle manufacturing and an
 equally strong enthusiasm for both classic and contemporary cars - 
although he has no link with either Aston Martin or its founder, 
Sir David Brown.

The Speedback is driven by a Jaguar supercharged V8, a six-speed automatic gearbox and can achieve 0-62mph in 4.8 seconds with a top speed limited to 155mph.

Next week, the Speedback will travel to Monaco to be shown publicly for the first time at the exclusive Top Marques show, which runs at the Grimaldi Forum from April 17 to 20.

The cars look even more alike from behind. The Speedback's rear lights rise slightly from the boot, giving the car aerodynamic tail fins

Meanwhile the DB5 was famous for its tail fins. They were seen as a nod to the iconic fins seen on American cars during the 1950s, although delivered with an understated British cool that perfectly captured the mood of the following decade

David Brown (car's emblem pictured) said: 'The launch of Speedback is the realisation of a dream for me, and is the result of skilful and dedicated work by a team of highly talented designers, engineers and craftsmen'

Although the price tag of the car is not yet know, it is likely to be in the hundreds of thousands. Above, one of Speedback's bespoke wire wheels

With his concept for a classically 
styled GT car with modern mechanicals and reliability, he began to 
assemble his specialist team some two years ago.

He said: 'The launch of Speedback is the realisation of a dream for me, and is the result of skilful and dedicated work by a team of highly talented designers, engineers and craftsmen.

'I am delighted at the reaction of our suppliers, potential customers and friends, and I look forward to presenting the car to the public in Monaco.

'The Speedback name perfectly reflects 
the classic sports car tradition of the past, while also doing justice 
to the sophisticated silhouette of the car’s hand-built body and unique 
styling which features, among much other detail, a fold-down picnic 
seat.'

The supercar will be produced in 'limited numbers' according to Mr Brown

Engineers, designers and craftsmen put the finishing touches to Speedback

The car is the result of 18 months of hard work by the David Brown Automotive team, including chief designer Alan Mobberley.

'This car will appeal to anybody who desires a truly individual sports car, which can boast a fine British pedigree and which will only be produced in limited numbers.

'This will ensure the kind of exclusivity associated with Britain’s once proud heritage of traditional, high-quality, automotive coach- building,' said Mr Brown.

Although the price tag is not yet known, it is likely to be in the hundreds of thousands of pounds... so you'd better start saving.
