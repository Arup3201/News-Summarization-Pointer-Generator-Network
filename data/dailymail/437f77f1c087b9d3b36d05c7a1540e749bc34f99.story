It is the recognised symbol of Canada but now those inventive Japanese have found a new use for the maple leaf – eating them.

Once the leaf turns red, enterprising chefs in Osaka dip them in sweetened tempura batter and then fry them in vegetable oil. Other cooks in Minoh are more patient and preserve the leaves for a year in salt barrels.
