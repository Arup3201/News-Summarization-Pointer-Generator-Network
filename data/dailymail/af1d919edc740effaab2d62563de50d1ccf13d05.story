It is a normal rite of passage for a baby to be toilet trained, but not many people extend that training to their dog.

However, this Welsh Corgi, PingPong, certainly knows its manners and has been taught to use a human toilet all by herself.

The dog's owner decided that using a toilet was a necessity for her pooch as the pair live in an apartment. 

PingPong, an adorable Welsh Corgi, has been trained to use the human toilet all by herself

Her owners have set up a small staircase to help her reach the toilet bowl

After she scales the stairs, the pooch can stand on - and pee over top of - the perforated platform

And it seems her skills are in demand. Since uploading a video of PingPong using a step ladder to reach the toilet and urinating into the toilet bowl, dog-owners have been inundating her with advice on how to train their pets to do the same.

The adorable video shows the dog scurrying into the washroom and up the four steps needed to reach the bowl.

And yes, she does slip and stumble a bit along the way. 

Perfect for apartment dogs, this loo trick is not just impressive - but makes for an effortless clean up 

Where's my treat? PingPong looks eagerly at her owners after completing the task 

Once PingPong gets to the top of the ladder, there is a makeshift perforated platform that she can stand and pee on.

The platform is secured to the bowl with clips and makes for an effortless clean up as the pup's pee simply strains through. 

Posting the video online, the dog's owner writes: 'My puppy PingPong pees on the toilet ALL BY HERSELF! Successful potty training for living in an apartment.'
