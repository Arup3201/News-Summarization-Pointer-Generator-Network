New service: It is likely that music fans will soon be able to enjoy a new streaming service from Apple

They're already arguably the top name in the electronic and music download markets.

But software giant Apple now look set to take their domination of the digital world a step further as they plan to challenge the likes of Spotify by launching a music streaming service.

The company are reportedly to launch the service, which could be called iRadio, later this year with talks in progress with the three main music companies - Universal Music, Warner Music and Sony.

Negotiations with Universal and Warner are said to be more advanced.

It is believed that the aim is to encourage users to download songs from its ten year old iTunes store - already the biggest music retailer in the world - by introducing them to new artists.

The service will reportedly be free, according to the Guardian, and paid for by advertising.

Apple will have another new rival looking to gain its share of the market with Twitter set to launch a similar service this weekend.

The new service, designed by Australian firm We Are Hunted, called #music will allow people to tweet music suggestions to their friends, follow their favourite artists andlisten to tracks from Soundcloud and iTunes.

Twitter will showcase #music at the Coachella festival.

It is no surprise that Apple is apparently looking to dominate one of the fastest growing markets in the entertainment world.

Subcribers to services such as Spotify and Pandora increased by 44 per cent last year.

Music analyst Alice Enders told the Guardian that the new Apple service is most likely to challenge Pandora, which claims to be used by a third of the US online market.

She said: 'It's a big decision for the recorded music industry whether Apple should become a subscription service; the all-you-can-eat service seems to be the nirvana for the music industry even though there is the potential to cannibalise download sales.'
