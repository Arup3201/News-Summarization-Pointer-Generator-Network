Thibaut Courtois has backed Chelsea to go all the way this season, claiming they have a team good enough to win the quadruple.

Jose Mourinho's side are still in the Capital One Cup, the FA Cup, the Champions League, and are top of the Premier League, giving Chelsea's No 1 keeper hope that they can achieve the maximum.

'It's difficult to say if we could win all four but we are playing well,' Courtois said. 'We have passed through all competitions.

Thibaut Courtois is confident that Chelsea have a team good enough to win the quadruple this season

There are a number of first-team players yet to experience winning a trophy at Chelsea, including Courtois

'Now we are in the semi-final of the Capital One Cup, are top of the league, there is an important game in the FA Cup on Saturday which we have to win and soon we will be playing PSG in the Champions League. 

'It will be hard but we have the team that can win everything. It's what we're aiming for.'

There are players in Chelsea's squad who have never won a trophy in west London, Courtois included. 

Last summer's signings Diego Costa, Felipe Luis and Cesc Fabregas are hoping to taste success in their first season as Courtois added: 'Myself, Costa, Filipe, Fabregas and the rest of the team want to win trophies for Chelsea. That starts in the League Cup to the last game in the Champions League.

Chelsea's last trophy came under Rafa Benitez when they won the Europa League in May 2013

'We want to win everything, it will be difficult, but I think we have the team to do it. Hopefully we can achieve it.' 

Chelsea's next test on the road to quadruple success comes against Bradford on Saturday; on paper, one of the easier ties they will face in the second half of the season. Indeed, Paris Saint- Germain are their opponents in the next stage of the Champions League.

A 1-1 draw in the semi-final first leg of the Capital One Cup at Anfield on Tuesday night gave the Blues confidence that they will be able to take Liverpool back to London next week and beat them.

If Chelsea beat Liverpool next week, they will set up their first Wembley fixture since the FA Cup in May 2012

That will set up a first Wembley final of the season, against either Tottenham or Sheffield United, and Courtois believes one final spur them on.

'If you play a final and win it, you get that feeling to win trophies and you want to win more and more and more. That feeling is in the whole group now, especially after what happened last season when they didn't win anything and were close to some trophies. 

'You want to win everything that's possible, starting with the League Cup.'
