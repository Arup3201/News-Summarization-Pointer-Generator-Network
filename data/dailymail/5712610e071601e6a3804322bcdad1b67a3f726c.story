A candid home video shows that it's not just expectant mothers who can suffer from baby gender disappointment.

The clip, which sent into the Today show, sees five-year-old Annie being told the sex of her new sibling by her parents.

But instead of celebrating the fact she will be getting a baby brother she breaks down in tears exclaiming: 'It's a boy? I didn't want a boy, I wanted a girl!'

I wanted a sister! The clip, which was sent into the Today show, sees five-year-old Annie being told the sex of her new sibling by her parents

In the video Annie looks at an ultrasound scan that her mother Janie is holding to see who the new family member will be.

She reads a label on the image stating 'boy' and it slowly dawns on her that it wasn't the news she was expecting.

Her smile soon turns to a look of confusion and then an expression of pain.

'It's okay,' her parents say, trying to console her.

Today show host Hoda Kotb explained afterwards that Annie was having 'a hard time' with some boys at school, which prompted her tearful reaction.

Disappointed: But the youngster clearly isn't happy about the news

Since the video was recorded, Annie's mother gave birth to a boy named Luca.

According to NBC News Annie is now thrilled to have a little brother and is 'determined to train Luca to be her protector.'

Familyeducation.com advises parents-to-be on how to best prepare a child for the arrival of a new sibling.

'After you've broken the news, talk to your child about it often enough so that he can share new thoughts and concerns as they arise.

'Talk about your reasons for wanting another child, about what babies are like, about how they grow inside a mother's belly.'

On the subject of gender it continues: 'If you don't know the sex of your baby, talk about that, too - but try not to build up expectations for one gender over the other.

'If you do know the sex, by all means let your child know, too (although you should keep in mind that methods of sex determination can sometimes be wrong). And ask your child's opinion about possible names you are considering.'
