A suspected plot to kill a magistrate with a rare poison extracted from the seeds of a Peruvian plant has been uncovered by police.

Detectives believe Meena Patel, 54, was the target of an unprecedented attack with abrin, a substance described as ‘more poisonous than ricin’.

Her daughter Kuntal, 36, is accused of spiking her Diet Coke with the toxin after allegedly buying it from an underworld website based in the US.

The alleged intended victim, who sits on the bench at Thames Magistrates’ Court, apparently drank the substance at her home in Stratford, East London, but survived.

Abrin is derived from the distinctive red seeds of the rosary pea plant, a sub-tropical perennial commonly found in Peru. It strikes at the liver, stomach and kidneys, and leads to vomiting, seizures and an agonising death within 72 hours.

Experts say a dose as small as three millionths of a gram can kill if it enters the bloodstream. There is no known antidote.

Kuntal Patel, who works for Barclays 
at its headquarters in Canary Wharf, appeared before Westminster 
Magistrates’ Court yesterday accused of attempted murder.

Mistake? The family of Mr Sutcliffe, a first secretary to the Foreign Office, claim police may have 'messed up' after a tip-off which led to the garden being dug up

She
 was arrested by detectives from Scotland Yard’s counter terrorism 
command during a huge search operation last weekend. They were acting on
 a tip-off from the US Department of Homeland Security which smashed a 
hidden website that specialised in selling lethal toxins.

Dozens of officers subjected the Stratford home she shared with her mother to a fingertip search as part of the investigation.

They also combed the back garden, neighbours’ bins and a nearby skip, and seized Meena Patel’s white Nissan Micra.

Kuntal Patel, wearing a blue Hello 
Kitty sweatshirt with a pigtail hanging down her back, was told she does
 not face any terrorist charges yesterday. Instead she is accused of 
attempted murder between December and January 26. District Judge Jeremy 
Coleman refused an application for bail and sent her case to the Old 
Bailey for a hearing next month.

In
 a separate development, it emerged that a senior diplomat became 
embroiled in the search after his son signed for a package which police 
believed contained the poison.

Arrests: Police stand guard outside Mr Sutcliffe's house during the operation in leafy Streatham Hill. His son James was released on bail, with one relative claiming Scotland Yard said he had 'nothing to worry about''

Response: Dozens of officers spent four days searching the Sutcliffes' four-bedroom home and garden. Above, officers raid Mrs Patel's house in east London on January 26

Well equipped: Many of the police officers were wearing biohazard suits and using breathing equipment

James
 Sutcliffe, 19, was arrested under counter terrorism laws after it is 
believed that he innocently accepted the parcel for his neighbour.

Investigators
 are examining the possibility that the package was delivered to someone
 who lives next door to him in Streatham Hill, South London.

Mr
 Sutcliffe’s decision to accept the package is believed to have led 
police to spend four days searching the £650,000 family home he shares 
with his father Nicholas, a first secretary to the Foreign Office.

Neighbours
 looked on as specialist officers wearing protective equipment and 
breathing apparatus entered the property and sealed off the road.

Position: Mr Sutcliffe, a senior diplomat, was posted to Brazil in the early 1990s

Anger: The diplomat's sister-in-law Jenny described James's arrest as 'lunacy' and a 'mix-up'

They
 spent four days scouring the property and digging up the garden, using 
arc lights and tents so they could work around the clock.

James
 Sutcliffe was questioned for several hours on Saturday before being 
released on bail. On Wednesday he was told there would be no further 
police action.

None of his neighbours, the Wong family, was arrested although their house and garden were also searched.

A
 Sutcliffe family friend said: ‘They now want to get back to normal. 
James is very relieved that he has been totally cleared by the police – 
he knew all along he was innocent.’

There
 is not believed to be a single recorded murder in which abrin was used,
 but it has appeared in fiction.

Kathy Reichs includes a detailed 
account of the poison as a weapon in her 2011 novel Flash And Bones.

Planned operation: The arrests on Mr Sutcliffe and Miss Patel were made by police over the weekend

Scene: A neighbouring house belonging to a family from Hong Kong was also searched during the operation

Action: A Met spokesman said public safety was 'a priority' and people in the area didn't appear to be at risk
