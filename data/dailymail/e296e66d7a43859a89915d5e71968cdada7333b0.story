A man accused of causing a crash in 
which four members of a family drowned in a reservoir today disputed that he took a 'reckless gamble'.

Gordon Dyche, 24, a garage attendant, 
rejected the prosecution suggestion and insisted he only tried to 
overtake two cars when it was safe.

He told a jury at Caernarfon Crown Court in North Wales: 'I don't think it was below the standard of 
driving at all.'

Gordon Dyche, left,  denies causing three deaths by dangerous or careless driving. Denise Griffith, right,  has earlier told a court of the moment she escaped from
a crash in which her husband, mother and two foster sons drowned in a 
reservoir.

He denies causing the deaths by 
dangerous or careless driving of Emyr Griffith, 66, Phyllis Hooper, 84, 
and Peter Briscome and Liam Govier, both 14 and who had autism.

The family from Pontypridd died when 
their people carrier plunged into Llyn Clywedog near Llanidloes, mid 
Wales, on April 20, last year. Only the driver, Denise Griffith, 56, and
a family dog, escaped.

Dyche, a married father, described how
he had left home for work, in a Ford Mondeo, between 2.10pm and 2.15pm 
that afternoon. He was driving eight miles to Llanidloes to start work 
at 2.30pm.

He told his lawyer Geraint Jones that 
he came up behind a VW Passat car and the people carrier ahead of it. 
They were travelling at about 40mph and he followed them for between a 
mile and a mile-and-a-half.

He began to overtake the VW car but 
the Peugeot 807 people carrier then began to turn right across his path 
towards a lay-by and he struck the back. The Peugeot plunged into the 
water at a beauty spot.

Dyche told the jury: 'It felt like the end of the world. I felt helpless. There was nothing I could do.'

Tragic: Rescue workers work to recover the bodies from the car. Mrs Griffith has earlier managed to swim to safety

Prosecutor Simon Mills suggested the 
overtaking manoeuvre was 'needless'. But Dyche, of Llanbrynmair, said: 
'It wasn't needless.'

He disputed that he was 'cutting it a bit fine' to
get to work. The defendant claimed there was good 
visibility that day.

'You could see far enough ahead. It was safe to 
overtake,' Dyche insisted. 'If a car didn't pull across in front of me 
the overtaking manoeuvre would have been performed perfectly safe.'

Mr Mills said: 'You are blaming Mrs 
Griffith, aren't you?'

To which Dyche replied: 'That's not what I am saying at all. I am
not blaming anyone. It was a tragic accident. I know exactly how I 
performed my manoeuvre and I checked things were safe.

'There was no sign
of indicating at the time I started to perform the manoeuvre. There may
well have been afterwards but I didn't honestly see it.'

He added: 'Whether there was an 
indicator or not, another car should have made its correct checks and 
seen me in the mirror and therefore not performed the manoeuvre.'

Mr Mills then asked: 'You are still saying what 
you did was safe, not even slightly below the standard required?'

Dyche replied:
'I don't think it was below the standard of driving at all.'

Asked why he had said at the scene he 
was late for work and rushing, Dyche claimed he had panicked. Mr Mills 
suggested he had tried to 'weasel' his way out of blame.

Dyche insisted: 'I'm an honest man.'

Mrs Griffith's driving had been described by another motorist as 'exemplary'. She's told the jury: 'My life has been ruined.'

The trial continues.

Nighttime search: Police were forced to work into the night to recover the bodies
