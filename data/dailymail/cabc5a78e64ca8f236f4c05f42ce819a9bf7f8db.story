Chemists in Singapore have unveiling a groundbreaking new instant test for the most popular date rape drug.

The flourescent sensor can change the colour of drinks within second to warn people drugs have been added.

It can detect Gamma-Hydroxybutyric (GHB), or 'liquid ecstasy', which can can make anyone fall into a deep sleep.

The simple test for date rape drugs: GHB Orange, the fluorescent sensor for detecting date rape drug GHB (bottle in top left), under UV light with the drug GHB (bottle in top right), and when it was mixed into red wine without GHB (vial in front left) and with GHB (vial in front right)

GHB was used as a central nervous system depressant to treat sleep disorders, promote fat reduction and muscle development, until it was banned for sale as a supplement in the US by the Food and Drug Administration.

It is odourless and colourless, and can go undetected in anyone's glass.

A small amount of the drug -- two to four grammes -- can make anyone fall into a deep sleep.

Current tests for GHB are difficult to carry out, the researchers say.

Professor Chang Young-Tae, from the Department of Chemistry at National University of Singapore, said: 'The current method in the market is using (a) kind of paper (a tissue-like piece of paper) and... run the paper chromatography separations.

'The problem is, to run those samples -- the paper chromatography -- it takes about 10 minutes of your time.'

'Currently, we are using the test tube kind of approachâ€¦ but who would want to bring this (a test tube) to the discotheque?"'

Scientists from the National University of Singapore (NUS) have now found a way for GHB to show itself instantaneously - by changing the colour of the drink.

When the sensor is mixed with a sample of a beverage containing GHB, the mixture changes colour in less than 30 seconds, making detection of the drug fast and easy.

The team shortlisted 17 fluorescent compounds and further tested them with a wide range of different GHB concentrations.

Through this, the team identified that an orange fluorescent compound, coined GHB Orange, changes colour when it is mixed with GHB.

In order to examine the efficiency of GHB Orange, the team tested its detection capability by mixing a small amount of it with samples of various beverages, ranging from alcoholic, non-alcoholic, coloured and colourless drinks, which contain GHB.

drinks spiked with GHB are almost impossible to detect - but a new test claims to be able to make drinks change colour if it has been added

The test revealed differences in the fluorescence intensity between GHB-free and GHB-spiked beverages.

For drinks that are translucent or of a light colour, such as water or vodka, the change in colour can be easily detected with the naked eye.

The change in the colour of darker drinks, such as Cola and whiskey, requires the aid of additional lighting to better detect the change.

The team now hope to develop a simple kit they can commercialise using the technology.
