A 17-year-old who was kept in hospital and forced to have chemotherapy but is now in remission has revealed she has not been allowed to speak to her mom since beginning her treatment.

Cassandra Fortin, from Connecticut, was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in September, but did not want to receive the recommended treatment. 

But in January a court decided that she must have the chemotherapy at Connecticut Children's Medical Center - she was not able to make the decision as she is not legally mature enough.

Since then she has been kept in hospital for treatment. 

Cassandra spoke to NBC via Facebook chat from the hospital this week, 

She had to submit a list of people  to officials with the Connecticut Department of Children and Families (DCF), which has temporary custody of the teen who were allowed to visit her.

'The problem is I've given tons of names of people to be verified, [but] it just doesn't happen,' Cassandra wrote in an interview conducted via Facebook chat.

'I have not been allowed to see or talk to my mom since New Years, DCF is working on allowing visitation to start. 

'My boyfriend has not been verified to come see me ... For the most part I don't get many visitors.'

She told the news outlet that now the treatment is taking effect that the guard has been removed from her outside her door, but she is only allowed to visit the cafeteria if she's escorted by a nurse, patient care assistant or child-welfare official.

She said that she missed fresh air, but she was trying to stay positive.

Cassandra insisted that she never wanted to die and that she was prepared to try chemotherapy but only after exploring other 'alternative' methods first.

On Sunday the Department of Children and Families Commissioner Joette Katz said in a statement released: 'We are very pleased with Cassandra's progress toward a complete recovery.

'We understand how difficult this has been for Cassandra and her family, but we have had full confidence throughout that the medical professionals involved in her treatment would be successful in saving her life .'

Doctors said the chemotherapy would give her an 85 per cent chance of survival, but without it there was a near-certainty of death within two years.

Her mother Jackie Fortin said: 'She has always - even years ago - said that if she was diagnosed with cancer, she would not put poison into her body'

Hodgkins lymphoma (cells pictured) is a disease of the white blood cells

Hodgkin's Lymphoma is cancer of the white blood cells called B lymphocytes that circulate around the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body.

The lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes.

Lymphoma causes the lymphocytes to multiply in an abnormal way and collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes or glands. These lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection.

The most common symptom of HL is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin.

It usually affects young adults aged between 15 and 35 and adults over the age of 50. 

Almost all young people with HL will be fully cured. For older people over the age of 50, the cure rate is around 75 per cent to 80 per cent.

Treatment depends on the extent of the cancer and will usually involve a combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and drugs including steroids. 

Several other states recognize the 'mature minor doctrine', but the court said she did not understand the severity of her condition. 

She will have to wait until she turns 18 in September before she can make her own medical decisions. 

Cassandra was diagnosed in September and after initial surgery failed, she was given two rounds of chemotherapy. 

She then asked for treatment to be stopped and, in order to avoid further trips to hospital, ran away from home. 

Her mother Jackie Fortin supported her choice but the DCF claimed custody of the girl and took the case to court. 

'It's a question of fundamental constitutional rights-- the right to have a say over what happens to your body-- and the right to say to the government 'you can't control what happens to my body,' Cassandra's mother's attorney, Michael S. Taylor, told Fox CT.  

Her mother told NBC Connecticut that her daughter has long held the belief that she does not want 'poison' in her body. 

'She has always—even years ago—said that if she was diagnosed with cancer, she would not put poison into her body,' Ms Fortin explained.

She was then returned to Connecticut Children's Medical Center to start chemotherapy.

'CCMC reported to the Department of Children and Families that I was not giving medical attention to my daughter,' said Ms Fortin.

Writing for the Hartford Courant, Cassandra said: 'This experience has been a continuous nightmare. 

'I want the right to make my medical decisions. 

'It's disgusting that I'm fighting for a right that I and anyone in my situation should already have. 

'This is my life and my body, not DCF's and not the state's. I am a human — I should be able to decide if I do or don't want chemotherapy. 

'Whether I live 17 years or 100 years should not be anyone's choice but mine.'

She added: 'I believe there's a natural way or at least an alternative to chemo out there that I am willing to look for and explore. 

'Not that it would cure the cancer but it may help it.'
