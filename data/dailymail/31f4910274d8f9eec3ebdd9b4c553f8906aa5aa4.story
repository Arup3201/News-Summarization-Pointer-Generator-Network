World War II re-enactors today staged the final Siege of Leningrad battle in St Petersburg to mark the 70th anniversary of the fight which ended the Nazi blockade of the city.

More than 400 history fans dressed up as Soviet Red Army soldiers and Nazi Germany troops to recreate the battle which ended one of the world's most deadliest sieges.

The re-enactment took place in the village of Porogki in Leningrad - now known as St Petersburg - in front of hundreds of spectators.

The battle marked the end of the Nazi blockade of the city of Leningrad, now St Petersburg,  in the village of Porogki 

It also involved military vehicles, trucks, cars, and motorcycles of the era as wartime planes whizzed overhead while actors sought to imitate the battle as closely as possible.

The siege of Leningrad began in September 1941, three months after Nazi Germany launched Operation Barbarossa against the Soviet Union.

The German and Finnish siege was broken on January 18, 1943, but it wasn't until January 27, 1944, a year later that it was finally lifted.

More than one million people perished during the 872-day siege. Leningrad's name was changed back to St Petersburg after the 1991 Soviet collapse.

Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin took part in a memorial ceremony in Kirovsk, near his native city of St Petersburg, to mark the anniversary.

The 61-year-old leader said the world should never forget 'the courage and heroism of the Soviet people and residents of Leningrad'.

The near two-and-a-half-year siege by Nazi forces is seared into the national consciousness as one of the darkest moments in Russian history.

Taking Leningrad was a strategic part of Adolf Hitler's ultimately failed plan to eliminate the Soviet Union as a threat to German domination of Europe.

The assault is considered one of the most devastating sieges in history, with German commanders calculating that starvation would be their most effective weapon.

'360,000 civilians died in Leningrad over a period of just four months from the end of 1941 to the start of 1942,' Putin said at a meeting with war veterans and survivors of the siege.

'Britain lost nearly the same amount in the entire World War II. Can you imagine the difference between the victims that the Soviet Union and other countries of the world laid on the altar of common victory?'

Surrounded by several dozen survivors of the siege, Putin earlier visited the famed Piskaryovskoe Memorial Cemetery, the main memorial to the victims of the siege.

Putin also honoured the memory of his elder brother who died during the blockade and was buried at the cemetery in a mass grave, the Kremlin said.

The president also laid flowers at a memorial on the banks of the Neva River marking the site of one of the most important battles during the siege in which his father participated as a soldier.

The blockade of the former imperial capital claimed the lives of more than a million people, according to historians.

Most of them died of hunger and exhaustion during an extremely cold winter at the beginning of the siege from 1941 to 1942 when rations fell to just 125 grams of bread per person for white-collar workers and municipal heating was switched off.

People were forced to eat pets, earth and glue and some even resorted to cannibalism. Dead bodies littered the streets for days as the survivors were too weak to bury the deceased.

Early Monday, some 1,500 people took part in a military parade showcasing Soviet-era war-time T-34 tanks as well as modern Iskander ballistic missiles.

In the run-up to the anniversary the local authorities put together an exhibition reconstructing part of a street in the city centre with siege-related artifacts like sandbags, boarded-up windows, theatre bills and old cars and trolleybuses.

'When I look at the chronicles and the pictures I can barely hold back tears,' said Natalia Zvereva, 60, who brought her grandchild to see the exhibition. 'It was such an awful time.'

Sergei Stepanenko, 45, added: 'My grandmother survived the blockade. She could not talk about it. It was too horrible.'

Elsewhere, German lawmakers honored the victims of the Nazi army's three-year siege of Leningrad as part of this year's Holocaust Remembrance Day.

German President Joachim Gauck wrote to Putin to express Berlin's 'deep sadness and shame'.

'Germany recognises its historical responsibility for the suffering inflicted on the people of Leningrad and for the brutal warfare of its soldiers, commandos and SS formations," he wrote in the letter provided to reporters by his office.

'I tell you and your people that we share the pain for the losses and sympathise with the survivors who are still suffering from the aftermath of the war.'

Gauck acknowledged that starving the besieged population into submission had been the strategy of the Nazis. The assault on Leningrad is considered the most lethal siege in history.

'The monstrous scope of human suffering still leaves us aghast,' he said.

Gauck said that the shared memories of Leningrad served 'to make us particularly appreciate every step toward German-Russian reconciliation'.

The German Bundestag lower house of parliament dedicated its memorial day for the victims of Nazi Germany this year to the people of Leningrad.

The anniversary coincides with the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp a year later, in 1945.

Writer and war veteran Daniil Granin, 95, was invited to describe his horrific memories of the siege to the chamber, where Gauck and Chancellor Angela Merkel were also seated.

'Hunger was brought to the city to wage war, instead of soldiers,' Granin said speaking through an interpreter.

'We had to load the corpses that were so emaciated they were as light as firewood onto wagons. For a long time I could not forgive the Germans,' he said.

The 872-day siege by Nazi forces between September 1941 and January 1943 is widely seen as one of the darkest moments in Russian history.

The blockade of the former imperial capital claimed the lives of more than a million people, according to historians.
