Hundreds of druids and pagans have gathered to experience the winter solstice at Stonehenge today.

The crowds dressed in Bronze Age clothing danced, chanted, and pressed their heads against the rocks the celebrate the dawn of the shortest day of the year.

They were joined by 3,500 visitors at the site to watch the sun rise at 8.09am.

It is the only time the meticulous layout of the stones appears to align.

At dawn, the sun casts a line of light directly connecting the altar stone, the slaughter stone and the heel stone.

While many left the newly developed Â£27million site soon after sunrise, the New Age Tribes will stay for the full spiritual experience until well after the sun sets at 3.53pm.

The precise moment of the winter solstice, when the sun reaches its southern-most point, changes every year. Tonight it will be at 5.11pm.

The Winter Solstice is regarded as more 
important than summer as it was the time when Bronze Age clans would 
slay cows, finish fermenting their wine, and mark the start of a new 
year.

It is the first solstice since the 
unveiling of the new English Heritage site, complete with interactive 
laser technology that lets visitors experience the solstice at any time 
of the year.

The Winter Solstice is the moment when the sun reaches its most southern point, after which days get longer again.

It creates an alignment at neolithic sites around the world, including Stone Henge, Newgrange in Ireland, and Cerro del Gentil pyramid in Peru.

Neo-druids, neo-pagans, and Wiccans - a variation on paganism - gather to chant spiritual mantras and bless the sun.

This year, the chief druid blessed a baby, which is a great honour for druids.

Many of our traditional Christmas tokens, including the Yule log, mistletoe, and decorating Christmas trees, started as Winter Solstice rituals.

The head of a Neolithic man was even created to mark the biggest capital project English Heritage has ever undertaken.

But it sparked a row with the druids, as the bones on which the model was based are now displayed for context.

In protest against the new visitor site, Chief Druid Arthur Pendragon, who claims to be a reincarnation of King Arthur, led a counter celebration on the other side of the monument.

Their prayers and chants coincided with a protest, as druids held up signs and banged on drums urging tourists to boycott the site.

Mr Pendragon said: 'The Winter Solstice was incredibly over-managed this year. The situation with parking was awful and everyone was herded like sheep.

'People were asked to leave before midday, when in previous years they have stayed at the Solstice until well after 5pm.

'I got the impression that English Heritage wanted worshippers out of there as quickly as possible because they thought they got in the way of tourists.

'I'm sad to say that it was an utter shambles.'

Chants of 'rebury the dead' and 'grave robbers' were shouted at the visitor centre by the group, while tourists were told 'don't pay, go away'.

As dawn approached, Mr Pendragon produced a bouquet of flowers before a woman who held mistletoe over it, chanting.

Others wore robes and some arrived dressed as unicorns.

Kate Davies, who manages Stonehenge for English Heritage, said: 'Our staff received lots of positive feedback from visitors who celebrated the Solstice joyfully and peacefully.

'On arrival, people gathered at the entrance to the Monument Field eagerly awaiting confirmation that it was light enough to safely enter the site and they were given free access from 7.30am until 9.00am.

The exact time of the solstice, when the sun reaches its southern-most point, will be at 5.11pm today

'Visitors were able to park on Byway 
12, on the A344 and in the old visitor centre car park. We also opened 
up the new visitor centre car park to accommodate even more people.

'We believe the majority of people who came along this year would agree that it was a well-run and successful Winter Solstice.'

While the site's managers see it as a way
 to reflect on our history, the New Age Tribes are calling for the 
remains to be reburied.

Arthur Pendragon said: 'Pre-Christian human remains can be put in display, but ones afterwards cannot. Our ancient ancestors should have the same protrection under law.'
