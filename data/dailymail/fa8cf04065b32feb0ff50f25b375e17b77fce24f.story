Eric Millerberg, named as a 'person of interest' in the murder of teenage babysitter Alexis Rasmussen, asked friends to 'bring a car and don't ask any questions' on the night the girl went missing, police say.

Alexis, 16, had been babysitting for Millerberg and his wife Dea when she disappeared seven weeks ago. Her body was found in a shallow grave by an interstate in Ogden, Utah on October 18.

The schoolgirl had last been seen on September 10 when she was babysitting the Millerbergs' two young daughters.

Two friends of Millerberg told investigators he called them the night Miss Rasmussen went missing and asked about a car and help to get rid of something.

There were also claims by the same witness that a 16-year-old girl had requested that Millerberg 'shoot her up' with drugs and that she wanted to have a threesome with the couple.

There were also claims by the newspaper that Miss Rasmussen was 'partying with the Millerbergs' and had been paid for her baby-sitting services with drugs.

Dea Millerberg, accompanied by Alexis, also allegedly sold some prescription drugs to one of the girl's friends for $100 and 'a small amount of marijuana'.

CCTV tapes allegedly showed Alexis and Dea Millerberg at a Walgreen's pharmacy at around 10.30pm that night picking up a prescription.

It was first thought Alexis had runaway when she failed to come home on the night of September 10.

At 11.30pm the girl texted her mother Dawn Miera and 
told her the Millerbergs were not home yet, so her mother told her to stay the night
as it was so late. That was the last she heard from her.

The Millerbergs told police she left 
at midnight to meet a friend, though the boy she was supposed to have 
met said she had just text him but they did not meet.

One
search warrant which was released by the Ogden court stated that human 
blood was found in the Millerbergs' home in an area where the carpet and
padding had been removed.

Investigators also found a car sold by Eric Millerberg to someone in Utah County where carpet had apparently been removed from the trunk.

Search warrants containing the grim details surrounding the case were temporarily released to the media before being sealed by a judge in Weber County.

Neighbours of the Millerbergs have previously said they believe the couple may have paid some babysitters with drugs.

Both
Eric and Dea Millerberg were arrested and charged with drug-related 
violations around the time Miss Rasmussen was reported missing.

Mrs
Millerberg is facing two felony counts of falsely obtaining a 
prescription. Eric Millerberg violated parole by using drugs and was 
sentenced for up to five years in prison on October 25.

The couple have yet to be charged in connection with the 16-year-old's death. Prosecutors were waiting on autopsy results.

Dea Millerbergâ€™s defense attorney said he expects homicide charges to be filed against his client and her husband this month.

Alexis Rasmussen was buried October 29. A memorial service was held in her home town of Ogden with mourners releasing hundreds of balloons into the sky in her memory.

Tammy Reed, the aunt of Alexis Rasmussen, told The Salt Lake Tribune that the new developments surrounding the case are 'just sad'.

Eric Millerberg was repeatedly in 
prison from 1997 to 2006 for burglary, discharge of a firearm and 
failure to stop at the command of police, according to Department of 
Corrections records.

The Salt Lake Tribune also reported he was affiliated with Silent Aryan Warriors, a white supremacist prison gang group.
