David Cameron is under intense pressure to crush Ukip in next month’s Rochester by-election after senior figures in his own party blamed him for the Eurosceptic party’s surge.

After losing the previously safe Tory seat of Clacton to Ukip, the battle in the seat of Rochester and Strood, Kent, has become a critical test of the Prime Minister’s authority, warned MPs.

The Tories had been braced for defeat in Clacton where the Ukip candidate was Tory defector Douglas Carswell – a popular MP in the constituency. Nonetheless, there was alarm at the scale of his triumph.

David Cameron has pledged to throw 'everything he can' at Rochester as the Conservatives face potential upset in another 20 key marginal seats where a Ukip swing could had victory to Labour

Mr Carswell recorded an overwhelming victory over the Conservative candidate with 59.6 per cent of the vote and an increased majority of 12,404.

The Tories took 8,709 votes, or 24 per cent. Labour took 3,957 – some 11 per cent, meaning its share of the vote more than halved.

Sources at Tory HQ said they were now planning to recruit Labour and Lib Dem voters – who strongly dislike Nigel Farage – to vote Tory in a ‘keep Ukip out’ campaign in Rochester, where former Conservative MP Mark Reckless has also defected to Ukip.

The Prime Minister is promising to ‘throw everything he can’ at the contest, which is expected to be much closer than in Clacton.

Conservative party chairman Grant Shapps said the by-election results at Clacton and Heywood had been ‘an alarm clock message, a stark warning’.

But he warned Ukip voters that the person with a ‘big smile on his face’ would be Ed Miliband, who would ultimately be handed victory if the rise of Ukip continued to split the Tory vote.

After the result, former Tory deputy chairman and pollster Lord Ashcroft, a regular critic of Mr Cameron said scathingly: ‘The Conservative Party leadership must take a large part of the credit for the rise of Ukip.’

And veteran right-winger Sir Edward Leigh also blamed his party’s leaders for the rise of Ukip, saying the result in Clacton was a ‘warning shot’ across the party’s bow.

‘A whole host of errors conceived or approved of by Tory bigwigs has fostered the steady loss of votes to the Faragists,’ he said.

Sir Edward said ‘coalition with the Liberals, increased taxes on the middle classes, cuts to the armed forces, failed and wasteful green policies, failing to deliver the promised referendum on Lisbon, the massive increase in international aid spending, and controversial and revolutionary social policies such as same-sex civil marriage’ had all contributed to the result.

He suggested that collapsing the Coalition would show disillusioned potential Tory voters that Mr Cameron was serious about addressing their concerns. ‘In order to reconnect with our supporters, we need to break up the Coalition,’ he said.

One senior source on the powerful 1922 Committee of backbench Conservatives said the Rochester by-election had become ‘more important’ as a result of Thursday night’s results.

But he said Mr Cameron had ‘belatedly come up with the right prescription’ when he promised big tax cuts and reform of EU free movement in his party conference speech earlier this month.

However, another senior backbencher warned Mr Cameron could face ‘a real crisis’ if Ukip wins in Rochester.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said voters in Clacton could see the economy was improving but still felt a ‘lack of security’ and were ‘frustrated about what they perceived as an influx of immigrants, mostly from Europe’.

‘They were adamant that they wanted this controlled, in or out of the EU, and they wanted to have their say on whether we left the EU,’ he wrote on the ConservativeHome website.

‘They were also disenchanted with what they perceive as Westminster insincerity.

Mr Reckless defected to Ukip last month on the second day of their conference, and has been heavily criticised as a traitor by some Tories

Nigel Farage was out celebrating until 4.45am with his new Ukip MP after Douglas Carswell stormed to victory in Clacton with a majority of 12,404 votes

‘Many were clear that they understood that the by-election was an opportunity to send a signal to the Government. Yet, despite all this they couldn’t have been clearer that they were also ready to be persuaded to vote Conservative at the General Election, that they understood the difference in the two votes.’

Mr Duncan Smith added that he was ‘struck by the fact’ that many voters ‘still don’t realise that they will decide Britain’s future only if the Conservatives are in power after the next election – that it is only David Cameron who is committed to deliver that referendum they want’.

Eurosceptic Conservative MP Mark Pritchard admitted he had been ‘attracted’ by Ukip. But he insisted he had been persuaded to stay by Mr Cameron’s promise last year of a referendum on Britain’s EU membership.

‘I came to the conclusion that if I really want to renegotiate the United Kingdom’s relationship with Europe, the only party that can deliver that is the Conservative party,’ the Wrekin MP said.

Mr Pritchard said he did not believe any more Conservative MPs would defect to Ukip before the next election. Greg Hands, the Government’s deputy chief whip, agreed, saying: ‘Part of my job is to know the Conservative Party and I am confident that there won’t be.’

Former Conservative MP Jerry Hayes, a barrister, said Ukip had ‘officially replaced the Lib Dems as the spittoon for the aggrieved, the nutters, the no-hopers and thoroughly p***** off’.

One poll has put Mr Reckless, who defected from the Conservatives to Ukip last month, on course for victory in Rochester and Strood.

However, the Tories have yet to select a candidate and strategists are confident they can defeat the MP – who lacks the personal appeal of Mr Carswell – by winning back supporters flirting with Ukip. 

They are also drawing up plans to woo Labour and Lib Dem voters who dislike Ukip – a tactic credited with delivering victory in a by-election in Newark earlier this year.

Labour may have been given a scare in Heywood and Middleton, but the truth is Ukip still remains a far bigger risk to the Tories

The outcome of the General Election in May is now almost impossible to predict.

For the Tories, the by-election results were abysmal. In Heywood and Middleton, their vote collapsed in a seat where they performed respectably in 2010. In Clacton, they suffered a swing against them to Ukip of 44 per cent.

For the Liberal Democrats, the outcomes just confirmed their catastrophic decline since their U-turn on tuition fees. At Clacton, they even lost their deposit.

Labour, too, was shaken. Heywood and Middleton is the sort of safe, northern constituency they should win easily. But they triumphed by just 617 votes after a swing of 18 per cent to Ukip.

That demonstrates the potential threat that Ukip represents in Labour’s heartlands.

If the voting patterns seen on Thursday were to be replicated in a General Election – which, of course, they won’t be – the outcome would be astonishing.

A similar swing to the one in Heywood to Ukip would see Farage lead his party to an overall majority with 331 seats.

Labour would lose 32 seats of its current 257, the Lib Dems 52 out of the 57 they won in 2010, and the Tories would lose 246 MPs, leaving them with just 57.

If Ukip’s success at Clacton were to be repeated next year on a national scale, then Britain would virtually be a one-party state.

But by-elections are totally different from General Elections.

Ukip cannot fight on a national scale as intensively as they did in Clacton, while their efforts will also be undermined by the first-past-the-post system.

And here is the silver lining for Labour. Even with the powerful campaign mounted by Ukip, Labour were still able to hang on in Heywood and Middleton. Indeed, their share of the vote actually went up by 1 per cent.

The lesson is that Labour’s safe seats remain resilient.

The truth is that Ukip remains a bigger danger to the Tories. Polling shows that 14 per cent of people who voted Tory in the 2010 General Election plan to vote Ukip next May, whereas the figure for Labour is 6 per cent.

That gives Ed Miliband a key advantage in many of the crucial marginal constituencies.

Based on the latest polls, it is possible Labour could take some 20 of these from the Conservatives – seats that would stay Tory if it was not for Ukip stealing their votes. In addition, there are five marginal Lib Dem seats which are key Tory targets that could remain out of David Cameron’s hands because of the greater number of Tory switchers to Ukip.

That is why Miliband may still win an overall majority. The latest average of the polls puts Labour on course for a majority of 18 in the Commons.

If the Tories lose the Rochester and Strood by-election, they will be in real trouble.
