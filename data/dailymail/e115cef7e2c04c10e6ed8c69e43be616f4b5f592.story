Atrial fibrillation — an erratic heartbeat — affects up to 800,000 Britons, and can lead to a stroke if left untreated. 

Eileen Marshall, 67, a retired insurance worker from Southend, Essex, underwent a new procedure for it.

THE PATIENT 

'Even after a nap I’d feel drained of energy,' said Eileen Marshall

Four years ago, I noticed I was feeling increasingly tired. 

Even after a nap I’d feel drained of energy. 

After four months I saw my GP who did several blood tests, but each came back normal.

Then in November 2013, I had a health assessment before surgery for arthritis in my hand — this involved having an electrocardiogram to record my heart’s electrical activity. 

Apparently, they do this for the over-60s to check your heart is OK and it’s therefore safe to operate.

The next day, the hospital advised me to see my GP, who said my operation was being postponed because my heart was beating very fast.

I was prescribed beta-blockers to slow my heartbeat, but I had to stop taking them as it swung too far the other way and got down to just 30 beats a minute (60 to 100 is normal).

Other pills didn’t help either and I still felt incredibly tired.

Eventually, my GP referred me to Southend University Hospital’s cardiology department. 

A year ago, I was put on a heart monitor for three days and was later diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF) — the extreme tiredness I’d been suffering was a typical symptom.

I was told that normally your heart contracts and relaxes to a regular beat. 

But with this condition, random electrical pulses fire off from veins around the heart, so the upper chambers beat irregularly or quiver.

This meant my heart had to pump extra hard to get oxygen-rich blood around my body, which explained the tiredness. It could also put me at risk of blood clots and stroke, so I started taking the blood thinner warfarin.

The heart monitor had shown that my heart was quivering (‘fibrillating’) at certain times of the day; in between it would return to normal. This narrowed the range of suitable treatments.

'After a week, the fatigue lifted... Now I’m enjoying life,' said Eileen

Given that drugs had been unsuccessful, my cardiologist suggested I had catheter ablation, where they use a wire to burn away the areas of heart tissue triggering rogue electrical pulses.

In June, I was referred to cardiologist Professor Richard Schilling at Barts Health NHS Trust in London. 

He told me about a new technique: instead of burning the affected tissue, he’d freeze it with a special balloon.

This would be faster and more successful at stopping the rogue signals getting to my heart. 

The procedure would take an hour and not involve a general anaesthetic.

I had the procedure in July. I arrived at the hospital early in the morning, was given a local anaesthetic and sedated, and was discharged by 2pm.

I’d been warned about bruising in the groin as this is where the tube attached to the balloon is inserted — but I had no side-effects at all.

After a week, the fatigue lifted. I still take warfarin as a precaution against blood clots and keep an eye on my pulse.

But now I’m enjoying life, such as travelling with my husband Joe.

THE SURGEON

Richard Schilling is a professor of cardiology and electrophysiology at Barts Health NHS Trust.

Atrial fibrillation causes an irregular and often very fast heart rate.

The heart’s natural pacemaker — called the sinus node, an area of cells in the upper right chamber, or atrium — is over-ridden by abnormal electrical impulses fired off by the four pulmonary veins, which drain oxygenated blood from the lungs into the left atrium. 

These ‘rogue’ signals cause the heart’s two upper chambers, the atria, to contract randomly and at a rate of up to 200 times a minute.

This means that oxygenated blood is not pumped properly but pools in the heart, causing palpitations, dizziness, breathlessness and fatigue.

Doctors start newly diagnosed patients on drugs to regulate the heartbeat. We can also do cardio-version, where electric shock treatment resets the heart to a normal rhythm.

But this doesn’t tackle the underlying cause and isn’t suitable for patients such as Eileen — her AF was intermittent and the heart would reset itself.

Cryoballoon therapy: A tiny balloon filled with gas is super-cooled to minus 75c. The balloon freezes a perfect ring of scar tissue around each pulmonary vein, so there are no gaps

Doctors can also ‘burn’ the tissue around the pulmonary veins, usually with catheter ablation — where a wire with an electrode on the end is threaded up to the heart via an incision in the groin.

It burns a ring of dots around the source of the faulty signal, forming scar tissue, which blocks the signal.

However, 40 per cent of these treatments need to be redone — tiny gaps can remain between the burns, causing some signals to get through, or the scar tissue may repair itself.

Cryoballoon therapy gets round this problem. A tiny balloon filled with gas is super-cooled to minus 75c. The balloon freezes a perfect ring of scar tissue around each pulmonary vein, so there are no gaps.

I’ve been conducting a clinical trial that shows the cryoballoon is quicker to perform than conventional ablation because it forms the ring of scar tissue in one go, rather than being burnt away bit by bit. 

The cryoballoon has been available on the NHS for six years, but we’ve been performing a streamlined version for six months.

I’ve cut the procedure time from three hours and an overnight hospital stay to one hour, with the patient going home that day.

Symptoms cease in up to 80 per cent of patients and if this treatment is still working after three months, it’s likely to remain effective — and the scar tissue is less likely to recover, though it’s unclear why.

There’s also less trauma to the tissue, partly because catheter ablation uses radio waves which convert to heat, which is more damaging. 

This procedure is ideal for people like Eileen with intermittent atrial fibrillation and for whom drugs don’t work.

The earlier you treat people with intermittent AF, the more chance you have of preventing their condition becoming persistent.

First, we make two tiny punctures in the femoral vein at the top of the leg on the right side of the groin. 

Through one, we insert a wire to stimulate the nerve supplying the diaphragm — if it’s twitching, we know it isn’t being damaged during the freezing.

Through the second hole, we insert a long tube — a catheter — and thread it into the left atrium, which is responsible for pumping oxygenated blood around the body. 

At the end of the tube is a 10mm long balloon.

We pump nitrous oxide into the balloon, which inflates to 28mm in volume and freezes to minus 75c. We position the inflated balloon inside the entrance of one of the pulmonary veins.

The freezing surface of this balloon sticks to the rogue tissue causing the atrial fibrillation. 

We hold it in place for four minutes while it creates a 1mm diameter unbroken circle of scar tissue.

We repeat the process at the entrance of all four pulmonary veins to prevent the rogue signals entering the heart.

Patients go home after four hours’ bed rest. The cryoballoon is a step forward in the treatment of atrial fibrillation. 

As more of these procedures can be performed in a day, it could shorten waiting lists.

ANY DRAWBACKS?

As patients with atrial fibrillation take anti-clotting drugs, they are more prone to bruising from the surgery.

There is also a rare chance of the procedure damaging the gullet, though this risk is lower than with catheter ablation.

Dr Glyn Thomas, a consultant cardiologist and electrophysiologist at the Bristol Heart Institute, says: ‘There has been a revolution in the treatment of AF and for many patients it is curable.

‘Of course, we do need to see the results of this study, but the hope is this procedure will increase first-time success, which will be good news for patients.’

The operation costs £6,000 on the NHS and £9,000 privately.
