Violent attack: Former Big Brother contestant Charlie Drummond, pictured outside court, has been jailed for 21 months at Newcastle Crown Court

A former Big Brother star has been jailed for a violent assault where he left a man’s foot ‘facing the wrong way’.

Charlie Drummond, who came fourth in the show in 2009, has been sentenced to 21 months behind bars after a jury found him guilty of causing grievous bodily harm, in the ‘sustained attack’.

Mr Drummond, 27, was heading home after a night out in Newcastle when he attached an innocent man in the street because he believed the man was mocking him.

The former reality TV personality left victim Jamie Ritchie with a fractured leg and dislocated ankle, which needed three operations and four months in plaster to correct.

Sentencing at Newcastle Crown Court, Judge James Goss QC told him: ‘You set upon Mr Ritchie, who did not provoke in any way the reaction that you formulated.

‘You grabbed him, you took him to the middle of the road, took him to the ground, during the course of which he suffered a fractured leg and severely dislocated his ankle.

‘You continued to assault him by, at the very least, punching him while on the ground.

‘This was a sustained assault on a man who had done nothing to deserve it. As a result of the attack, he suffered really serious harm.

‘It caused considerable pain and he required three operations under general anaesthetic to repair the damage that had been done.

‘You have contested your guilt, which is your right, but by reason of doing that you have sought to blame everyone but yourself for what took place.’

Newcastle Crown Court heard former Mr Gay UK runner-up Drummond carried out the violent attack on Jamie and his friends in the early hours of April 14 last year.

Mr Ritchie, 32, told the court he and his friends were heading home after a night out in the city when a teenager who was with Drummond's group initially attacked one of Mr Ritchie's friends before the violence turned on him.

Despite the group repeatedly telling their attackers they were not looking for trouble violence erupted.

It is thought Drummond may have wrongly believed Mr Ritchie and his friends were laughing at him and his friends as they passed in the street.

But Mr Ritchie said, he had actually been laughing at himself after accidentally walking into a lamp-post.

‘He (Drummond) punched me with his left fist in the face,’ he told the court.

‘I didn't know what was going on, I tried to stop him. Then I went to the ground. I was on the floor and not able to get up and had excruciating pain in my ankle.

‘I was punched several times. When I was on the floor I was trying to stop him punching me.

‘I was on the floor until the ambulance arrived.’

The court heard witnesses claim Drummond, who has lost his job at Barclays bank and is deep in debt, had pulled Mr Ritchie by the leg while he was on the ground injured during the attack.

Prosecutors accept it was a male, who cannot be named, who was with Drummond that night who started the violence with Mr Ritchie's group by headbutting one of them in the face.

Drummond, who lives in Croydon, London, but originally comes from Cleadon, South Tyneside, denied any blame for what happened.

Instead the housemate, who has been the victim of violence in the past, told jurors it was he who came under attack from Mr Ritchie's group.

He said: ‘I was not there to cause anyone injury, I was protecting myself and that is the truth.

‘I was terrified for my life. I didn't know what was going to happen, that is honestly how I felt.

‘I was quite emotional if I'm honest. I just wanted it to be over.’

Drummond told the court he had drank four pints that night while out celebrating his sister's birthday but was not drunk.

Shaun Routledge, defending, said Drummond was working in a Barclays bank in London selling insurance, mortgages and loans until he told them about the court case and it was decided it would be ‘best he left’.

Mr Routledge said Drummond had hoped to earn £25,000 per year through his new employment with a recruitment agency in the capital.

He added: ‘For the most part, this young man has demonstrated that he is not a person to cause trouble.

‘He is not the type of young man who goes looking for trouble.’
