A South Carolina Sate Senator is under fire after saying that it's okay to make fun of women because they are 'a lesser cut of meat' than men. 

Republican State Sen. Thomas Corbin said the statement, reportedly directed at Republican South Carolina State Sen. Katrina Shealy, in a discussion over a pending criminal domestic  violence (CDV) bill.

Shealy is the only female member of South Carolina's 46-person State Senate. 

Republican State Sen. Thomas Corbin statement, it's okay to make fun of women because they are from 'a lesser cut of meat' than men, was reportedly directed at Republican South Carolina State Sen. Katrina Shealy in a discussion over a pending criminal domestic violence (CDV) bill

'Well, you know God created man first. Then he took the rib out of man to make woman. And you know, a rib is a lesser cut of meat,' Corbin said at a dinner at a Brazilian Statehouse with fellow Senate judiciary committee members, according to FITSNews. 

The sexist comment came after Shealy reportedly asked Corbin where he 'got off' attacking women during the discussion about the pending bill.

He insists, however, that he was joking when he made his statement, according to WISTV.

'We were all joking and laughing' he told WISTV. 'We cut up together.'

He also reportedly told others that he got Shealy 'wearing shoes', referring to the idea of women being barefoot and pregnant. 

Shealy told Corbin that he had pushed her far enough, according to WISTV. 

She said that she told Corbin: 'I've worked three times harder than you did to get here... I deserve respect and I'm going to get it.'

This isn't the first time Corbin has made sexist remarks to his colleagues. 

A Senate staffer told FITSNews that he makes comments like that 'all the time to everybody'.
