Progress: Scotland Yard boss Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has admitted that there has been movements in the McCann case, suggesting that officers are closing in on the person that abducted her

Britain's most senior police officer has suggested his officers are closing in on the people who abducted Madeleine McCann.

Scotland Yard boss Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe admitted his officers have the names of suspects and that ‘some progress’ is being made in the inquiry.

But he declined to be drawn on when the suspects would be quizzed over her disappearance in Portugal seven years ago.

He told BBC’s Radio 5 Live: ‘We have sent three letters of request for international assistance to the Portuguese judiciary, because that is the way their system works.

‘We have got lines of inquiry which are different to the Portuguese Police’s and we are working with them to try to resolve that.

'We are making some progress.’

Asked by presenter Nicky Campbell whether his officers had the names of suspects, he replied: ‘That is correct’.

He declined to comment further.

Sir Bernard’s comments came after the Mail revealed exclusively last month that the Met has identified three burglars as prime suspects for Madeleine’s disappearance.

Analysis of mobile phone data suggests the men were close to the scene of her abduction, at the time she went missing, and that they were in close contact with each other in the hours that followed.

Following our revelations, Portuguese newspapers reported that three former Ocean Club workers are Scotland Yard’s prime suspects over her disappearance.

Details of the men’s alleged links to the Mark Warner-run resort in the Algarve, where Maddie vanished from in 2007, were revealed in a number of Portuguese newspapers with close links to local police.

They were disclosed two days after 
Portuguese police had a high-level meeting with a visiting Scotland Yard
 delegation late last month.

At
 the meeting, Met detectives are reported to have requested bank details
 of the men, who are thought to have carried out a series of break-ins 
at the Ocean Club in the run up to Maddie’s disappearance.

Although
 local media reported the men had been employed at the Ocean Club 
complex in Praia da Luz, it was not clear whether they were working 
there at the time Madeleine went missing in May 2007.

Nor was it clear whether they were directly employed by Mark Warner, or through a contractor.

Madeleine McCann went missing in 2007, and local media have reported that certain people of interest in the case had links to where she vanished from

Madeleine, who was then nearly four, disappeared from her family’s holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in the Algarve on May 3 2007 as her parents dined at a nearby restaurant with friends.

It is now known that between January and May 2007 there had been a four-fold increase in the number of burglaries in the area.
