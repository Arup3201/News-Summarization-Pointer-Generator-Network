A father who feared his little girl would never hear him say ‘I love you’ has hailed the miracle treatment which has allowed her to hear for the first time.

When Emily McMullan was born 22 months ago, doctors noticed something was wrong with her hearing and specialist tests revealed she was severely to profoundly deaf.

Her father Paul, 34, and mother Rose, 29, struggled to deal with the news Emily may never hear, but threw themselves into trying to help her.

Emily McMullan, 22-months, was born severely to profoundly deaf but can now hear after being fitted with a cochlear implant. She is pictured with her brother Adam, four, and her parents, Paul and Rose

The couple, from Baillieston, Glasgow, have now seen Emily come on leaps and bounds after she was fitted with a cochlear implant, which means she can hear and interpret sounds.

Last December, when Emily was just 13-months-old, she had an operation to fit the implant. The following month it was ‘switched on’.

Since then, there has been no stopping Emily, who can say ‘dada’, ‘mama’ and ‘look’.

Accountant Mr McMullan said: ‘When we were told Emily was deaf, it was very emotional and upsetting.

‘I remember thinking, “She will never hear me say I love you”.

‘When she was four-weeks-old she went through three hours of tests at Yorkhill Hospital, Glasgow, where they confirmed she was severely to profoundly deaf.

Since the implant was fitted, Emily has learned to say 'mama', 'dada' and 'look'. Her parents say that she has come on in leaps and bounds since being able to hear

‘But we realised there was all kinds of support available from the National Deaf Children’s Society and Yorkhill.

‘We were referred to the cochlear implant unit at Crosshouse Hospital in Kilmarnock, were Emily was assessed for suitability to be fitted with implants.’

Doctors gave Emily the thumbs-up for implants but, in the end, they could operate only on her right side because a previous illness had left her with a calcium build-up under the skin around her left ear.

However, even one implant is having a huge effect on the lively girl.

Mr McMullan said: ‘Every time we hear a new word it is emotional and wonderful.

‘When I come home from work at night I wait at the front door and shout “Emily” and my wee superstar comes running out for a hug.

‘We can also take her swimming and she can keep her implant on rather than taking it off because they have developed a thing called an aqua kit to keep the device safe.

‘We are so proud of Emily. She has been through a lot in the first 22 months of her life but she is always smiling and is a happy wee person.’

The National Deaf Children’s Society has arranged weekends for parents of young deaf children and Emily’s parents say they have learned a great deal from speaking with others in similar positions.

A cochlear implant is a surgically implanted electronic device that gives a person who is profoundly deaf a sense of sound.

It
will not cure deafness, but is a prosthetic substitute for hearing. The
sooner a child receives the implant, the less therapy will be needed to
help him or her learn speech.

The
device is surgically implanted under a general anesthetic and the 
procedure takes up to five hours. It involves making an incision in the 
skin and attaching the device through the bone behind the ear and into 
the inner ear.

The
devices receives sound, processes it, and sends small electric currents
near the auditory nerve. The currents activate the nerve, which sends a
signal to the brain, which the person comes to learn as hearing.

In the U.S., around 42,600 adults and 28,400 children have received the implants.

Mr McMullan is so impressed with the charity’s work, that he is running the Great North Run half marathon on September 15 to raise funds for the Society .

He has never run long distance before, but has been training for the big day.

He said: ‘I felt I wanted to thank them for all the support they have given us over the past 22 months.

‘I want to make Emily as proud of me as we are of her. I am hoping to raise £1,000 and anything else is a bonus.’

Emily’s older brother Adam, four, is also enjoying being able to communicate with his sister.

He even understands when she has not got the implant activated and asks his parents to turn it on.

And the family is set for a new arrival because Rose is expecting her third baby, due to be born in eight weeks.

Mr McMullan said: ‘It couldn’t be better for Emily - she has a big brother who will look after her and will soon have a wee sister or brother she can look after as they grow up.’
