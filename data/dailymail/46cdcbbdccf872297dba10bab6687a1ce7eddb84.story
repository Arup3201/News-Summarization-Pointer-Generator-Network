Charged: Oelwein mayor Joseph Manus, who was arrested yesterday by sheriff's deputies after a month-long investigation into alleged sexual abuse

The mayor of a Midwest town is facing a potential 125 years in prison after he was charged with the alleged sexual abuse of two young girls.

Sheriff's deputies swooped on the home of Joseph Manus, mayor of Oelwein, Iowa, acting on warrants charging him with five counts of second-degree sexual abuse.

The 36-year-old is accused of abusing a 14-year-old girl four times and a nine-year-old girl once between July and August 2010. Each count carries up to 25 years in prison.

The investigation was not initiated by the city's own police department, according to reports. Manus was arrested by deputies from Fayette County Sheriff’s Office.

A statement from the sheriff's office said some charges could not be filed because of Iowa's statute of limitations on sexual offences.

Oelwein is a small , mainly white city of just more than 6,400 people in north-east Iowa. A former 'railroad town', its population has been in slow, steady decline since the 1980s when most railroad tracks around it were abandoned.

City officials told the Waterloo Cedar Falls Courier they didn't know the specifics of the investigation, but they pointed out the incidents were alleged to have happended before Manus became mayor.

'The Oelwein City Council, administration would like to express our deepest concerns for those involved in today’s development,' said City Administrator Jamie Letzring in the statement.

During an initial court appearance, Manus was ordered held on a $125,000 bond. He said he anticipated retaining attorney Craig Ament, who didn't immediately return a message left by the Associated Press.

After moving to the town only six years ago, Manus narrowly defeated the incumbent mayor, Larry Murphy, in November 2013 and took office in January after the tally was upheld by a recount.

Mr Murphy told the WCF Courier: 'If it’s true, it’s sad for the community.

'Obvious, it was a close election, and I think the people of the community were ready for a change. But I think there’s always a risk voting for someone who, I would say, most of the community didn't know very well.'

Local people were shocked to hear of the accusations. Sarah Lewis, who has lived in Oelwein for 12 years, told CBS2 Iowa: 'Obviously it strikes harder than it would in a bigger town.

'It's a very unfortunate thing but it's things like this that brings the community together.'

Pedro Velez, another local, worried that the allegations might 'tear this town apart'.

'There are gonna be people who say he couldn't have done it. There are others that are gonna say hang him, get rid of him,' he told CBS2.

Sheriff Marty Fisher said his office launched the investigation a month ago after receiving information from the Iowa Department of Human Services.
