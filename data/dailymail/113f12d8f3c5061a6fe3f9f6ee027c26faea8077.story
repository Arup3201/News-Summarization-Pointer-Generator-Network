Jamie Gao, 20, was last seen getting into a white car parked near a fast food restaurant on Arab Road in Padstow in Sydney's south west at about 1.40pm last Tuesday

The former police detective accused of murdering Jamie Gao appeared briefly in Kogarah Local Court today, where he was refused bail.

Glen McNamara, 55, was brought up into the dock at around 12.10pm from the police cells where he had spent the night after being arrested and charged with murder and with supply of a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine at Padstow, in Sydney's west last Tuesday.

Wearing a dark grey t-shirt, navy denim jeans, brown suede boots and his hair cropped short, Mr McNamara sat passively in the court for the brief hearing.

At one point he peered through his black framed spectacles at the gallery where two adult women and two teenage girls, believed to be his family members, were sitting.

Earlier the two young girls had appeared upset as they passed through the court doors.

McNamara's lawyer, Hudson Lu, made an application to Magistrate Christine Haskett for protective custody in Silverwater prison where McNamara will be taken this afternoon.

Mr Lu did not apply for bail and police prosecutor Kristy Zurvas formally refused it.

Magistrate Haskett adjourned the matter to July 22 at Central Local Court.
