While cinema-goers  flock in their droves to see Fifty Shades Of Grey, a gaggle of women have taken a different approach to mark the release.

Thousands have been harassing a man they believe to be the real-life Christian Grey.

And he has no qualms about the comparison.

'I started getting messages from people I didn't know,' said Brayden Olson who, like Grey, is 27 and single.

Award-winning entrepreneur: Olson's holding company for real estate, Wilhelm Enterprises, is titled after his middle name - much like Grey's self-titled firm Grey Enterprises in EL James's hit novel series

Leading figure: Like Olson, Grey is highly influential as one of Seattle's leading business figures

Women, he told Business Insider, have flown in from around the world. 

'I knew the movie would bring more attention, but I continue to be really surprised by the whole matter.' 

He too is an award-winning entrepreneur based in Seattle, who is very rarely seen out of a suit.

Like Olson, who is director of Washington Security Exchange, Grey is highly influential as one of Seattle's leading business figures 

While Grey was named Seattle's most eligible bachelor, Olson has been named Seattle's 'best man'. 

His holding company for real estate, Wilhelm Enterprises, is titled after his middle name - much like Grey's self-titled firm Grey Enterprises.

And though Olson doesn't have a Charlie Tango helicopter, he says he drives a BMW i8, which is a match for his fictional doppelganger's Audi R8.

To the doubtless disappointment of many, he sidestepped comparisons with Grey's sexual antics.

However, he told Business Insider, a girl he once dated told him he reminded her of Christian Grey.

Numerous similarities include the fact he refers to most people as 'Miss' or 'Mr' - an eerie echo of the way Christian Grey says 'Miss Steele'.

Olson has not met EL James, the British mother who wrote the book using Twilight fan fiction she posted in forums online, but he has now read all three and concedes the parallels are 'pretty mind-numbing'.

But there are a few discrepancies - primarily that the fictional character is a billionaire who is at leisure to spend plenty of time outside the office.

'Christian Grey has got me beat,' Olson told Business Insider. 

'He is a character from a book. I don't think a real person can compete. I claim to be the real Brayden Olson. 

'I'm sure you can relate to how strange it would be to have a fictional character made up and so many things true about you in your real life.'

'Pretty mind-numbing': Olson admitted he was shocked by the sheer scale of similarities he shares with Grey

Olson claims he has not entertained the stream of  letters from women around the world that detail fantasies akin to the scenes in EL James' hit novel.

But with the release of Sam Taylor-Johnson's movie adaptation, he is using the publicity to promote the domestic violence charities he works with. 

He tells Business Insider: 'It exists in every community and affects a significant portion of our society. 

'I donate to my local domestic violence program called LifeWire, and I encourage others to become active in the conversation however they can. 

'The line between choosing to show affection more non-traditionally as seen in Fifty Shades of Grey and moving into the category of domestic violence is consent and desire. 

'Remember, Ana and Christian negotiated their contract in the boardroom!'
