Pay hike: West Midlands Ambulance Service chief executive Anthony Marsh is now earning £232,000 a year, getting an extra £50,000 for taking on East of England Ambulance Service

An ambulance boss is now earning £232,000 a year after landing himself a £50,000 pay rise for taking on another service.

West Midlands Ambulance Service chief executive Anthony Marsh gets the extra money as he now splits his time working for East of England Ambulance Service.

The additional pay means he now earns almost £90,000 more than the Prime Minister's £142,500 salary.

West Midlands Ambulance Service has 
defended Dr Marsh's pay, saying it was cheaper than the cost of hiring 
another boss to run one of the organisations full time.

However, Tom Watson, Labour MP for West Bromwich 
East, has criticised the Government for giving public servants 'banker style' increases.

'This man is probably the highest paid public servant in the West Midlands and nobody has ever heard of him,' Mr Watson said.

'He is receiving banker style top-ups to his huge salary whilst taxpayers are struggling to pay their monthly bills.

'It's not fair, it's not right and ministers should stop it.'

Dr Marsh took over the troubled East of England Ambulance Service, which serves a population of 5.8million in Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Norfolk and Suffolk, at the beginning of 2014.

He had initially been commissioned to write a report because of 
concerns over its performance, and had recommended cutting back on 
management to pay for more emergency crew.

In a statement, West Midlands Ambulance Trust, which covers 5.3
 million people Herefordshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, 
West Midlands and Worcestershire, said paying Dr Marsh to perform both 
roles saved the taxpayer approximately £130,000 on the cost of a having a substantive Chief Executive in each ambulance trust.

'Mr Marsh is now responsible for the running of both organisations, 
doing the job of two Chief Executives,' said the statement.

'He is not, however, earning the 
salaries of two Chief Executives. On average, Mr. Marsh works at least 
70 hours a week to ensure both areas receive his full attention.'

The spokesman added that West
 Midlands and East of England Ambulance Services have a combined 
workforce of almost 9,000 staff, answer approximately 6,000 999 calls 
every day and cover an area of over 12,000 square miles.

New role: Dr Marsh took over the troubled East of England Ambulance Service, which serves a population of 5.8million in Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Norfolk and Suffolk, at the beginning of 2014

Dr Marsh started his career in the Ambulance Service in 1987, working his way up to chief executive level at the Essex Ambulance Service, before coming to the West Midlands in 2006, and taking over at the EEAST at the start of 2014.

The EEAST has been accused of poor performance, which may have contributed to 
patients' deaths, while a report this year found that its response times
 were unacceptably slow.

Figures from 2011, which were released in June, rated the service as the worst in the country for response times of 36 minutes or longer for top priority calls.

The trust also came in for criticism in April, when it was revealed that nearly £250,000 had been spent on PR staff to respond to criticism and promote the service's image.

Earlier this year, NHS figures revealed that the trust had been implicated in 155 'serious incidents' since April 2010.

Of
 those, 59 related to the unexpected or avoidable death of a patient - 
although the trust insisted that it was not responsible for the deaths.

After
 the trust was publicly criticised by MPs at a Parliamentary hearing, 
five non-executive directors resigned and new plans to improve the 
service were put into place.

Areport in January concluded that the service had got better in some 
ways, but ruled that its response times were still unacceptably poor.

After taking over Dr Marsh announced
 that more ambulances would be introduced and resources shifted from the
 back office to frontline services.

The trust's total budget came to £226million during the fiscal year 2012/13.

'East
 of England Ambulance Service was a failing trust. Since his appointment
 as interim Chief Executive, Mr. Marsh has brought in brand new 
frontline vehicles and almost 400 new staff. The organisation has turned
 a corner,' said the West Midlandsspokesman.

'West Midlands Ambulance Service is meeting its 
performance targets this year in very difficult circumstances and 
despite massive increases in demand. The West Midlands Trust is 
regularly seeing demand at 10 per cent above that commissioned, but the trust is
 still performing thanks to the hard work of staff.

'For 2014-15, 
Anthony Marsh’s total salary for his work at West Midlands Ambulance 
Service and East of England Ambulance Service is £232.226. This includes
 the £50,000 uplift for his additional duties for the East of England 
trust.

'By comparison, within the same two areas, there are 11 Chief Fire Officers and ten Chief Constables.'

Only a handful of Whitehall civil servants were paid more than Dr Marsh's salary in the past year.

Sir David Nicholson, the former chief exec of the entire NHS, was on between £255,000 and £259,999.

Others include cabinet secretary and Had of the Civil Service Gus O'Donnell who was on between £235,000 and £239,999.
