Lionel Messi's girlfriend Antonella Roccuzzo took to Instagram to celebrate Argentina's progress into the World Cup semi-finals.

Roccuzzo posed with two friends in replica kits outside the stadium in Brasilia as Messi's side saw off Belgium thanks to a Gonzalo Higuain goal.

Marching on: Argentina captain Messi salutes the crowd after his side's victory over Belgium on Saturday

Not for the first time this tournament the 26-year-old sported a shirt with the famous number 10 on it as she turned out to support Messi.

The Barcelona forward couldn't find the net in the quarter-final, the eighth time in a row he has failed to score against Belgium keeper Thibault Courtois.

Held back: Messi was closely marked by the Belgium defence but still managed to produce magic moments

Surrounded: The Barcelona forward skips away from Marouane Fellaini on the edge of the box

Turning point: Higuain fires home for the only goal of the game to earn Argentina a semi-final against Holland

But the Argentian talisman did have a hand in the only goal of the game, feeding Angel Di Maria who played in Higuain for his goal.

Argentina meet Holland in the semi-final on Wednesday.
