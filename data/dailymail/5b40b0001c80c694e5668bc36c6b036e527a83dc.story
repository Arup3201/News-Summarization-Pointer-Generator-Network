A shamed deputy headmaster is still being paid his £65,000-a-year salary - four months after he admitted secretly filming children in his school's toilets.

Gareth Williams, 47, was jailed for five years this week after admitting setting up a series of tiny spy cameras in clocks, fans and toilet cisterns of his school to capture images of semi-naked children.

But it emerged today that he is still being paid by education authorities and has pocketed £16,000 since January, when he pleading guilty to 31 offences, including voyeurism at his school and making and possessing more than 15,000 indecent images of children.

Gareth Williams was jailed for five years for filming children in the toilets and showers of his school with secret spy cameras - but he is still being paid by education authorities, months after he pleaded guilty

Cardiff Crown Court heard that Gareth Williams installed secret cameras in the school toilet on sports day to catch as many children as possible

Cardiff Crown Court heard that Williams was appointed deputy headmaster at Glantaf High School in 2008, one year before the first indecent images were recorded

Education chiefs have admitted that - despite now sitting in his jail cell - Williams will continue to be paid
 thousands every month until a formal disciplinary procedure is 
completed, which could take months longer.

A
 furious parent of a boy secretly filmed by Williams said: 'I am 
absolutely horrified that this man has continued to be paid thousands of
 pounds after what he did.

'It's a disgrace and the council should be ashamed of themselves.'

Cardiff Council claimed they couldn't begin disciplinary action against Williams until he had been sentenced.

The court heard that Williams had 16,419 indecent images of children and 691 videos at his home in Cardiff

A
 spokeswoman said: 'The sentencing concluded the criminal case against 
Mr Williams. Cardiff Council and the governing body are now able to take
 the appropriate action without delay.'

But
 even the Welsh Government has condemned the local authority's stance and 
said Williams should have been banned from teaching and stripped of his salary as soon as he pleaded guilty
 in January.

A spokeswoman 
for Welsh Education Minister Huw Lewis said: 'The actions of Gareth 
Williams were truly horrifying, and it is simply wrong that he should 
have been paid following his guilty plea.'

Williams,
 from Cardiff, was deputy head of Glantaf Welsh-language high school in 
the city, where former pupils include Hornblower actor Ioan Gruffudd and
 former Blue Peter presenter Gethin Jones.

Cardiff Crown Court heard a total of 31 boys at the 1,300-strong school aged between 11 and 16 were caught on his cameras and he had 16,419 indecent images of children and 691 videos.

The court heard some of the images dated back to 2009 – a year after he was appointed deputy head at the school.

During the court hearings, prosecutor
 Michael Jones said of the images relating to the voyeurism charges: 
‘All these images were of children exposed as they were using the 
lavatory or the showers.

‘They
 had also been uploaded to a computer and catalogued by their age at the
 time the children were filmed. Officers discovered images of young 
males and the school’s badge could be seen.

‘They had been filmed in the changing facilities in the school sports hall.’

Williams,
 who concealed one camera as a meter on the water cistern, even filmed 
himself on some of the videos as he secretly installed his devices.

A judge sentenced Williams to five years at Cardiff Crown Court (pictured), describing his actions as 'depraved'

Mr
 Jones explained: ‘On one of the videos he is seen crossing his fingers 
as he put it up. It showed he is hoping the camera is capturing the best
 possible images.’

Mr Jones
 continued: ‘This was a serious systematic abuse of trust. A devious and
 determined invasion of privacy of the children. The effect on children,
 staff and parents was one of complete and utter disbelief.’

In police interviews, Williams said he had been looking at child images for ten years ‘to understand physical development’.

He also admitted an ‘enduring interest in boys’ development’ but couldn’t explain why. He admitted it had become an obsession.

At his sentencing hearing, Judge Rhys Rowlands told Williams: ‘This is a dreadful and protracted breach of trust on  your behalf.

‘As
 a result of your depraved behaviour you have lost your career, 
livelihood and reputation. But this is nothing compared to the worry and
 real horror which is felt by parents who have trusted their children to
 you.’

He said: ‘I cannot conceive that you will ever be able to return to your previous occupation.’

After Williams was jailed, governors at the school said they had been ‘dismayed’ by the his actions.
