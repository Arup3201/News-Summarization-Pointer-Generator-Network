California has passed a law which will ban single-use plastic bags throughout the state, and bring in a 10cents charge to use disposal paper bags instead.

The legislation, which will come into effect in 2016, is the nation's first statewide ban on the bags, which will affect grocery stores, convenience stores as pharmacies.

New rules, signed into law today by Governor Jerry Brown will let grocers charge a minimum of 10cents to use paper bags instead.

The bill, SB270, is a response to rising levels of litter - particularly in the Pacific ocean. But it has outraged plastic bag manufacturers, who claim the bill will destroy jobs and drive up prices for the poor. 

A national coalition of plastic bag manufacturers immediately said it would seek a voter referendum to repeal the law, which is scheduled to take effect in July 2015. 

State Senator Alex Padilla (D-Los Angeles), who proposed the law, said that the will was already there because so many cities and counties - including LA and San Francisco - already have their own bans.

The measure marks a major milestone for environmental activists who have successfully pushed plastic bag bans in cities across the U.S., including Chicago, Austin and Seattle.

In a signing statement, Governor Brown said: 'This bill is a step in the right direction - it reduces the torrent of plastic polluting our beaches, parks and even the vast ocean itself. We're the first to ban these bags, and we won't be the last.'

Under threat: It is hoped reusable bags will become more widespread thanks to the bill - but manufacturers oppose it

Plastic bag manufacturers have aggressively pushed back through their trade group, the American Progressive Bag Alliance.

The group aired commercials in California blasting the ban as a cash-giveaway to grocers that would lead to a loss of thousands of manufacturing jobs.

Lee Califf, the alliance's director, said: 'If this law were allowed to go into effect, it would jeopardize thousands of California manufacturing jobs, hurt the environment, and fleece consumers for billions so grocery store shareholders and their union partners can line their pockets.'

Paper bag manufacturers also opposed the bill. The American Forest and Paper Association, a trade group, says it unfairly treats their commonly recycled products like plastic, while holding reusable plastic bags to a lower standard for recyclable content.

Responding to the concerns about job losses, the bill includes $2million in loans for plastic bag manufacturers to shift their operations to make reusable bags.

That provision won the support of Los Angeles Democratic Senators Kevin De Leon and Ricardo Lara, who blocked earlier versions of the legislation.

Lawmakers of both parties who opposed SB270 said it would penalize lower-income residents by charging them for bags they once received for free. The bill was amended to waive fees for customers who are on public assistance and limit how grocers can spend the proceeds from the fees.

Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Puerto Rico also have pending legislation to ban single-use bags.
