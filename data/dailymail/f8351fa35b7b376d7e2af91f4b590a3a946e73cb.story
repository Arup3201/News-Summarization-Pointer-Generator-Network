Mistrust: MPs criticised regulator Ofgem, run by CEO Alistair Buchanan (pictured) for failing to protect customers from profit-making firms

Energy companies have been blasted for ‘serious shortfalls’ in the way they explain price increases and bills  - leading to a ‘deep mistrust’ from customers unable to work out if they are getting a good deal.

MPs said it was ‘astonishing’ that Ofgem had not taken on recommendations to improve energy company reporting or listened to criticism on how competition in the market is measured.

The report - by the Energy and Climate Change Committee - was published as it emerged complaints from homeowners struggling with huge gas and electricity debts have soared to record highs - more than doubling in five years.

Figures from charities revealed they are receiving thousands of calls from homeowners unable to pay their energy bills after being hit with large price hikes.

Advice group National Debtline received more pleas for help from people about their gas and electric supplier than it did about payday loan companies or from homeowners who had fallen behind with their mortgage or rent. 

Many of the calls were from the elderly, some of whom owed thousands of pounds.

The MPs also criticised energy firms for failing to be open about their huge profits and was also critical of regulator Ofgem for failing to protect consumers.

Since 2007, the average price of gas and electricity have risen by 41 per cent and 20 per cent in the UK in real terms, according to the Department for Energy and Climate Change. 

Firms have introduced further hikes of up to 11per cent since the beginning of the year and experts warn of further price hikes.

Meanwhile, the big six energy firms E.On, SSE, British Gas, Npower, EDF and Scottish Power have enjoyed bumper profits.

The MPs on the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee have attacked these giants for ‘serious shortfalls’ in the way they explained price increases and bills  - leading to a ‘deep mistrust’ from customers who were unable to work out whether or not they were getting a good deal.

Complaints: The number of people struggling with gas and electricity debts has more than doubled in the last five years

According to figures from National 
Debtline it received a record 15,502 calls from people who had run into 
difficulties paying back their bills between January and June  - a 111 
pc increase in just five years.

Richard
Lloyd,of consumer group Which? said: ‘Hard-pressed customers 
consistently tell us that the spiralling cost of energy bills is among 
their top concerns, with energy firms trusted by fewer than a quarter of
their customers.’

‘People will not feel confident that they are paying a fair price for their energy unless prices are simplified and costs that make up our energy bills are open transparent and subject to robust scrutiny.

Sarah Harrison, senior partner at Ofgem, said the watchdog rejected any suggestion that it was falling down on the job.

‘We are here with one goal in mind, which is to protect customers, and we will use the full range of powers we have got to do that,’ she said. ‘That includes taking penalty action against companies who fail their customers - and they do.’

Last night Paul Crayston, a spokesman for National Debtline, said: ‘Undoubtedly the huge bill increases – which have far surpassed any rises in wages are to blame for the increase in people to unable to cope.

'For many families the simple act of turning on the kettle is going to eat up yet another chunk of their precious income.’

A spokesman for energy firm tradebody Energy UK said: ‘Energy companies take helping their most vulnerable customers very seriously and will to help where they can.

'We know that the cost of a whole range of household bills, including gas and electricity, is a real concern which is why anyone struggling to pay should contact their supplier.’
