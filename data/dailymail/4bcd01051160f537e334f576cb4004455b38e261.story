The plug was pulled on Manny Pacquiao’s last conference call as the Fight of the Century continued its bitter way towards a half-billion dollar fortune.

Bob Arum, the PacMan’s veteran promoter, ordered an end to the discussion when he realised that many more than the promised tight-knit group of leading sportswriters were jamming the lines.

Arum has always doubted the worth of mass telephone talk-ins, during which the same questions are often asked over and over again by different callers, many from the social media.

‘They’re a waste of time,’ says Arum.’I don’t want Manny tied up for hours like this.’

Pacquiao had just said ‘very good’ in response to an opening question about how well training camp was going.

At first, the camp had blamed the log-jam of callers for overloading the system.

Floyd Mayweather is due for his final conference call this Wednesday.

The wrangling goes on and on.

And still the tickets are not on sale!
