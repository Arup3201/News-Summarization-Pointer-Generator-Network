They were once the glamorous accessories of the great characters of the 20th century.

Beloved by prime ministers and film stars alike the fat, ideally Cuban, cigar was the must have item for any powerful man.

But it seems the cigars so favoured by Sir Winston Churchill, Clint Eastwood and Groucho Marx may soon become a thing of the past.

Over the last five years cigar consumption has dropped by a fifth, the continuation of a pattern which has seen the numbers fall by 80 per cent over the last two decades.

And experts warn that if current trends persist the age-old art will become extinct in Britain by 2026.

Figures from Revenue and Customs show that while Britons bought 4.6million lb of cigars in 1992, last year they bought just a fraction of that at 880,000 lb.

The UK cigar market as a whole fell by 20 per cent between 2007 and 2012, helped in no small part by the rollout of indoor smoking bans across the country in 2007.

Cigar enthusiasts believe the items have been unfairly targeted by this legislation, because they last more than an hour and are designed to be enjoyed slowly as opposed to a hasty cigarette in the cold.

The number of large cigars sold in Britain fell 40 per cent to 11.6million in the same period - declining twice as fast as smaller cigarillos.

'They see them as something their dad or grandad would smoke'

Simon Evans, Imperial Tobacco

There are only 300,000 regular cigar smokers left in Britain, according to Imperial Tobacco, the UK’s second largest tobacco company. Ten years ago, 700,000 people were cigar smokers.

Simon Evans of Imperial Tobacco told the Financial Times this is due to a lack of interest in the youth market. He said: ‘They see them as something their dad or grandad would smoke.’

Two thirds of all cigars sold in Britain are the cheaper miniature variety. Despite the steady decline in cigar smokers, sales of premium cigars which are handmade and aged have risen.

Luxury hotels are catering to smokers of high end cigars, providing Cosas - Comfortable Outdoor Smoking Areas. Two years ago, the Ritz Hotel opened an indoor cigar room next to its casino.
