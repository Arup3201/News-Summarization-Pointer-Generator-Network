Princess Eugenie was spotted returning to a chalet in the Swiss Alps after a day on the slopes.

Wearing a padded blue jacket and plaid shirt, the 24-year-old royal looked relaxed as she stepped out of the car with a group of friends, including Prince Harry's ex-girlfriend Cressida Bonas.

It comes after her father, Prince Andrew, issued a statement denying allegations that he abused an underage girl at an orgy when she was being used as a sex slave.

In an extraordinary legal allegation, a woman said she was ‘forced’ to have sex with the prince at parties in London, New York and the Caribbean.

Last night the prince issued a strongly-worded denial, with Buckingham Palace saying ‘any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue’. 

The woman – named only as Jane Doe #3 – says in court documents she was told to ‘give the prince whatever he demanded’ by his friend Jeffrey Epstein, the US billionaire paedophile who hosted the sordid parties.

Legal documents lodged with a court in Florida name Andrew, 54, as one of three men allegedly involved in abusing the woman 13 years ago when she was 17 – which is underage in Florida state law.

Epstein, a long-term friend of Prince Andrew, was one of the best-connected men in America until he was jailed for 13 months in 2008 for soliciting girls for underage prostitution.

The prince stayed friends with him despite his conviction and they were seen together in 2011 after Epstein’s release from jail.

Last night a Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ‘This relates to long-standing and ongoing civil proceedings in the United States, to which the Duke of York is not a party. As such we would not comment on the detail. However, for the avoidance of doubt, any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.’  

While Eugenie has been enjoying a holiday in Verbier, her sister, Princess Beatrice, was seen sipping champagne in the Carbibbean.

There, she was photographed on a yacht in St Barts with Bee Shaffer, whose mother Anna Wintour is editor-in-chief at American Vogue.
