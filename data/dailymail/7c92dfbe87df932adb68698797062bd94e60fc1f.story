These shocking photographs show how Syrian rebels have resorted to building dangerous makeshift weapons in their attempt to overthrow president Bashar Al-Assad.

Although the opposition has begun to smuggle in weapons on a larger scale, the distribution of them is reportedly still unorganised.

Local carpenters and plumbers have become involved in creating makeshift weapons that resemble those used in the Roman and medieval periods.

DIY grenades have been made from ornamental balls, catapults have been built to fire bombs at the army and cars have been armoured using corrugated iron.

A makeshift trebuchet was created from planks of wood and used to fire missiles into enemy territory.

Earlier this week the U.S congress gave permission to the Obama Administration to send military items to the less extreme rebels.

But, the House of Commons voted by 114 to one to ensure that the UK cannot send weapons without putting it to a parliamentary vote.

The head of Syria's opposition told U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday the country's situation was 'desperate' and called for the United States to arm the rebels quickly and to push harder for a political settlement.

A trebuchet is a weapon that was created in the middle ages and used to propel missiles into enemy territory.

The weapon was used in both Christian and Muslim countries around the Mediterranean.

The three chief distinguishing characteristics of a trebuchet are:

The rebels have adopted methods and weapons used in the making of both trebuchets and catapults.

The United Nations says more than 100,000 people have been killed since Syria's civil war erupted more than two years ago pitting President Bashar al-Assad's forces against rebels seeking to end his family's four-decade rule.

President Barack Obama, having withdrawn U.S. troops from Iraq and seeking to wind up the U.S. war in Afghanistan, has been reluctant to get involved in the conflict in Syria.

However, U.S. congressional panels this month agreed to a White House plan to provide arms to the rebels despite lawmakers' questions about its chances of success and concerns the arms might be used against Western targets.

A U.S. official has said funding for 
the classified program runs out on September 30, when the U.S. fiscal 
year ends. That means the White House will have to seek Congress' 
blessing again for arming the rebels, the official said, possibly 
setting up a renewed confrontation over Washington's policy on Syria.

'The
 U.S. commitment of military support to the Supreme Military Council is 
vital, but it needs to happen fast, and in a way that allows us to 
defend ourselves and protect civilians,' Ahmed al-Jarba, the Syrian 
National Coalition's newly elected leader, said in a statement released 
as he met Kerry in New York.

'The
 situation in Syria is desperate. We urgently need American action to 
push the international community to demand a political transition,' he 
added. 'American leadership and drive is essential to end this war and 
bring the democracy that the large majority of the Syrian people want.'

Jarba and three other senior SNC 
members - Burhan Ghalioun, Najib Ghadbian and Michel Kilo - are in New 
York to meet informally with the 15-member U.N. Security Council on 
Friday.

Jarba and rebel 
military commander General Salim Idriss met with French President 
Francois Hollande and other French officials in Paris earlier this week 
to appeal for diplomatic, humanitarian and military aid.

The Syrian rebels are frustrated that U.S. plans to send weapons to them have been held up by congressional concerns.

Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey have been supplying the rebels with arms, security sources and diplomats say.

'Military
 and violent actions must be stopped by both parties, and it is thus 
imperative to have a peace conference in Geneva as soon as possible,' 
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said after meeting with Kerry on 
Thursday.

The United 
States, Russia and the United Nations are still working to convene a 
meeting in Geneva between the Syrian government and opposition groups to
 try to broker a peace deal.

So far, attempts to organize a 
so-called 'Geneva II' peace conference on Syria to revive a political 
transition plan agreed in the Swiss city in June 2012 have been futile. 
U.N. diplomats say it is looking increasingly unlikely that such a 
conference will take place anytime soon, if at all.

Kerry told reporters that his almost hour-long meeting with the Syrian opposition leaders had been 'constructive.'

'The
 Syrian opposition committed that they believed Geneva II is very 
important and they agreed to work over the course of the next couple of 
weeks to pinpoint the terms, the conditions under which they think it 
could work,' he said
