After what happened at the Belgian Grand Prix, I took a lot of time to reflect on the events of the weekend – and we met as a team to discuss it last Friday, too.

I analysed the whole situation in a lot of detail and reached the conclusion that I had to take responsibility for what happened because it was my error of judgement. 

It didn’t matter what part of right and wrong was involved, the fact is that it happened and I did not do a good enough job to avoid a collision between our two cars. 

Error of judgement: Nico Rosberg (right) collides with Lewis Hamilton during the Belgian Grand Prix

I have since apologised to everybody that I can; starting with the fans because they wanted to see a battle with Lewis and that did not happen. I have apologised to my team, and to everybody involved with the team. I have also apologised to Lewis.

You cannot however, change what has happened.

The subject attracted a lot of media attention and sensation but I really hope my apology will be accepted by the Formula One fans who have been critical of me. 

I was booed on the podium - which wasn't a nice feeling - but I understand that people had travelled a long way to see a great race between Lewis and myself, and they did not get that. I totally respect their opinion and I hope that in time they will accept my apology. 

I love my sport so much, I want F1 to be the best in the world and I want the fans to enjoy great racing.

I started on pole in Spa but I got a really poor start off the line. I lost two positions to Lewis and then to Sebastian Vettel which dropped me down to third. 

I passed Sebastian after he made a mistake through Les Combes and then on the second lap I was quicker than Lewis coming out of Eau Rouge. 

Heading into Les Combes I tried to go around the outside of him to re-take the lead, but I misjudged the situation. 

In hindsight, the collision was my responsibility because I was the car trying to overtake, so I have to accept that I made a mistake and to apologise. 

I sustained damage to my front wing in the incident and it had to be replaced which saw me finish second behind race winner Daniel Ricciardo.

The result enabled me to extend my lead in the championship, but when I left the circuit I hadn't really thought about that. I was concerned and distraught about the situation; one thing is for sure: I wasn't happy.

I was instead thinking about the criticism - the way Niki Lauda, for example, had been critical about my driving.

Apology: Rosberg has said sorry to Hamilton following the crash in Belgium

Repentant: Rosberg also apologised to his Mercedes team and Formula One fans

I was also thinking about the team discussions we'd had at the track; the result of our collision meant that one of us didn't finish the race and the other one didn't win, so it had also cost the team a lot of points.

Niki has since apologised for what he said and, in the heat of the moment you often say things that you regret - that has happened to all of us. 

Last Friday, Lewis, Paddy Lowe, Toto Wolff and I met for talks at our headquarters in Brackley and it was very intense, but the outcome was a positive one: we have drawn a line under what happened in Belgium - we move forward and we can go racing again.

It has always been clear from the team that Lewis and I must not collide with one another during a race. If it did happen, and one driver is more responsible than the other, then there will be consequences. I've accepted that.

The team have made it clear that we can go racing for the remainder of the season, and all I can say is that I am feeling good and I'm in full-on attack mode heading into this weekend's Italian Grand Prix at Monza.

The team is doing such an awesome job in developing our car and making it faster and faster. So every race I have the chance to be on pole and win, which is a very special feeling.

Since Spa, I have been in the simulator preparing for Monza, and I have taken part in some PR work, for example a Driving Experience day with Mika Hakkinen and some UBS clients. 

Not a nice feeling: Rosberg was booed when he stepped on to the podium in Belgium

On Sunday we had what we call a team family day at Kelmarsh Hall in Northamptonshire. It's great because every employee of the Mercedes F1 team brings their family so you can imagine how busy it was!

There were thousands of us there, and it is nice to give something back for all the hard work they put in. 

This year they have changed the run-off area at the world-famous Parabolica corner in Monza, replacing the gravel trap with Tarmac. I haven't seen it yet, but I notice that it has attracted some criticism from the sport's fans.

I completely understand that and it is a pity because it makes it easier for the drivers when there is room for error. But safety has to be the priority, and that is why they've brought in the change.

Ricciardo's win in Belgium saw him close the gap to Lewis and I in the drivers' standings. He is doing a great job this season and he is a serious rival for title so we must keep a close eye on him and Red Bull in the remaining six races.

Mind the gap: Daniel Ricciardo celebrates his Belgian Grand Prix win  and he is doing a great job for Red Bull
