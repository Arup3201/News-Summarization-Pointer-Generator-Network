Buffalo Sabres owners Terry and Kim Pegula are closing in on their purchase of the Buffalo Bills.

The bid has been tentatively approved by members of late owner Ralph Wilson’s estate, two people familiar with discussions told reporters. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because the sale is being conducted privately.

The next step, the people said, is for the estate to get initial approval from the NFL. That could come by the end of the week in a process that could be completed by next month.

Winning start: Buffalo won their first game of the 2014 season 23-20 at the Chicago Bears 

The development comes a day after the Pegulas were among at least three prospective ownership groups to submit binding bids to purchase the team.

The other two groups to submit bids were New York City real estate mogul Donald Trump and a Toronto group fronted by rocker Jon Bon Jovi.

The Pegulas have been regarded as front-runners to buy the Bills since first expressing interest in May. 

They have made Buffalo their adopted home after buying the Sabres in 2011. They have a net worth of more than $3.5billion and the support of local business leaders and public officials because of their commitment to keep the Bills in Western New York.

Once identified as the prospective ownership candidates, the Pegulas would require approval from members of the NFL Finance Committee, which is to meet next week. They would also have to go through an extensive background check by an NFL-contracted security firm.

The final step would be approval from three-quarters of the league’s 31 other owners, which could come at league meetings next month. After that, NFL owners are next scheduled to meet in December.

Under NFL ownership rules, the Pegulas are allowed to own both the Bills and the Sabres because they are located in the same market.
