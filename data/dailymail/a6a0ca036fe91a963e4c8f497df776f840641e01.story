David Cameron today claimed Britain had moved 'one step closer' to having a say on the European Union as the Commons backed an in-out referendum.

In a landmark parliamentary 304 MPs voted in favour of a referendum, with none voting against as almost all Labour and Lib Dems MPs boycotted Westminster.

There was loud cheering on the Commons' green benches as a backbench Bill, spearheaded by Tory MP James Wharton, cleared the first hurdle in its difficult battle to become law.

The PM has ordered all Tory MPs to back 
legislation paving the way for a referendum on European Union membership
by the end of 2017.

Last night he hosted a barbecue in the Number 10 gardens to persuade MPs 
to stay in London today – rather than go to constituencies – for the landmark Commons vote

Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg have dismissed the Bill as a stunt designed to shore up the Prime Minister's position with his rank and file - pointing out that it has virtually no chance of becoming law.

But after the result was announced, Mr Cameron wrote on Twitter: 'Referendum Bill passes first Commons stage, bringing us one step closer to giving the British people a say on Europe.'

As the Commons debate on legislating for a referendum by 2017 got under, Foreign Secretary William Hague told MPs the European Union now lacks democratic legitimacy and must be reformed.

Mr Hague said: 'The efforts of those 
who want to build European integration without bringing the people with 
them have been utterly self-defeating.

'The
EU now lacks democratic legitimacy because so many of those most 
enthusiastic about ever-closer union have been afraid of asking what 
people might think of it.

He
added: 'No institution can survive without the people's support and the
EU that will emerge from the eurozone crisis may look very different 
from the EU before the crisis.'

Earlier Mr Wharton told the Daily Mail that Labour and the Liberal Democrats 
are ‘running scared’ of confronting the issue.

He said the legislation would mean future governments must change the
law if they want to reverse the plan – which he said is ‘politically 
virtually impossible’.

Mr Wharton said the Bill would mean a ‘legal deadline’ for a
referendum to happen before the end of 2017. 

‘It has been nearly 40 years since the British people last had
their say on Europe - and most of us have never had a say on Europe at all. I
wasn’t even born at the last referendum,’ he added.

‘In that time, so much has changed - the countries involved
and the powers the EU has, as well as the benefits and costs of membership.
People feel that the EU has been heading in a direction they never signed up
to. This question about our membership is already there and ignoring it will
not make it go away. These concerns deserve to be heard and acted upon.’

Dismissing the idea that the legislation is worthless, since
it could simply be ignored by an incoming Labour government, the MP insisted:
‘If my Bill is passed it would be legally impossible for a future government to
ignore it and, when you think about it, politically virtually impossible to
reverse it too.'

Tongs: David Cameron is hosting a barbecue for Tory MPs tonight, in scenes reminiscent of when he grilled meat with US President Barack Obama in the Downing Street gardens

The Prime Minister adopted some hot dog diplomacy last night to persuade his MPs to stay for the Commons debate.

Aide Sam Gyimah tweeted a picture of the Prime Minister ‘breaking a sweat as he flips burgers at No 10’ last night.

Mr Cameron hunches over a grill, tongue between his teeth, as he chats to Chatham and Aylesford MP Tracey Crouch.

The Eurosceptic wing of his party has 
been a thorn in Mr Cameron’s side, but he is now courting support for 
the Bill, as well as committing to a referendum if he wins the next 
election. It has triggered a Coalition row, with the Prime Minister 
saying Nick Clegg’s Lib Dems ‘have to get off the fence’.

Mr Cameron is an old hand at the barbecue, having had a cook-out with US President Barack Obama.

But his attempt to woo his MPs has not
won everyone over. One said: ‘In 2011 I was threatened with death for 
voting for an EU referendum, now I’m whipped and invited to a ****ing 
BBQ.’

The change of heart means that Britons
may be given their first say on Europe in nearly 40 years. The Bill’s 
sponsor says Labour and Lib Dems are ‘running scared’ of the issue as 
Tories prepare to back an in/out vote today.

In a sign of crumbling Labour 
discipline, shadow minister Ian Austin broke ranks to insist: ‘The truth
is the UK needs to decide and I would prefer it to do so more quickly. I
know this isn’t Labour Party policy, but my view is we should have a 
referendum next year.’

Lib Dems have refused to accept a 
coalition government Bill, but the Prime Minister has imposed a 
three-line whip – the strongest possible instruction – for the vote 
today, a highly unusual move for backbench legislation. That means 
members of the Government who might vote against must resign.

The legislation requires a national 
referendum by the end of 2017 on the question: ‘Do you think the United 
Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?’

Mr Wharton added: 'The Bill says that the government - any future government -
must by the end of 2016 have set a date for a referendum by the end of 2017. So
any government that dared to try to ignore this law and deny the people a vote
could be taken to court by anyone.

‘Of course, if after the next election there’s a majority in
Parliament against a referendum - and what a tragedy that would be - a
different Government could try to pass a new law to scrap the referendum, but that
is a fundamental rule of our ancient constitution.

‘So, of course, if you want to be sure of having your say on
Britain’s place in Europe, then vote Conservative at the next election. But
even so it would take a Prime Minister and a Government of astonishing
arrogance to vote down a referendum that was already the law of the land.’

Austin today said he thought his party should also back an in-out vote

Mr Wharton said that since the Conservatives do not have a
Commons majority, on the face of it today’s legislation would struggle to pass.

‘But the soundings I have taken suggest we could be on
course to clear the first hurdle towards putting the referendum on the statute
books. We have the backing of the Democratic Unionist Party,’ he said.

‘We just need a few Labour or Liberal Democrat MPs to
support the Bill. This isn’t about playing politics - it’s about letting the
British people have their say on one of the most important issues of today. I
would encourage them all to ignore the dictat of their leaderships, listen to
their constituents and vote for the Bill.

'I know there are MPs in other parties who want to. They need
not fear their leaderships. Ed Miliband and Lib Dem high command are running
scared - why else would they have told their MPs to stay away from Parliament
today?

‘Today marks the beginning of our attempt to make Britain’s
first referendum on Europe for 38 years happen. With a bit of help from MPs
from all Parties, my Bill could write an in-out referendum into law by the end
of 2017, the chance to finally let the British people have their say and decide
our future,’ he added.

The Bill cleared the Commons tonight, but Labour
believes it will not succeed in reaching the statute book by the cut-off date
of May 2014, when the Parliamentary session comes to an end. 

The Bill is
likely to run into trouble in the House of Lords, where Conservatives are not
the largest party.

A Labour source said: ‘It is our view that it is quite wrong
to legislate for an in/out referendum in 2017 which would create four years of
uncertainty, putting at risk the national interest and damaging British jobs
and the economy.’

Labour leader Ed Miliband urged MPs to dodge the Commons vote, calling it ‘a Tory gimmick’.
