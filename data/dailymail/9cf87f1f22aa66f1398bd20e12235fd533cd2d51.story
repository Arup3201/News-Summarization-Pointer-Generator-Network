Mick Jagger enjoyed a Father's Day meet-up with his ex-wife, his daughter and a son just hours after fresh details emerged of his tryst with a ballerina 43 years his junior.

The singer was seen smiling with former-partner Jerry Hall, 57, daughter Georgia May, 22, and son Gabriel, 16, as they left a hotel in Vienna, Austria, today ahead of a concert the Rolling Stones are due to give in the city tomorrow night.

Their lunch came on the same day the woman Jagger was recently spotted embracing on a Zurich balcony was named as dancer Melanie Hamrick.

Jagger's nine-year marriage to Hall ended 15 years ago but the couple, who have four children together, are still close.

The veteran singer, sporting trainers, a purple shirt and a green blazer, appeared relaxed and signed autographs for the army of fans waiting outside for photos.

The Stones are due to play at Vienna's Ernst Happel Stadion tomorrow night as they continue their 14 On Fire world tour.

It was the rocker's first public appearance since it emerged he met leading ballerina Melanie Hamrick two weeks before his girlfriend L’Wren Scott’s suicide.

American dancer Ms Hamrick, 27, was pictured embracing the 70-year-old singer ten days ago in Zurich, where the Rolling Stones were
 performing.

At
 the time, sources close to Jagger said the tryst followed a chance 
encounter in a nightclub. But The Mail on Sunday disclosed today that 
Jagger first met the New York-based dancer three months earlier – and 
6,800 miles away – in Japan.

On March 6
 this year, Melanie and a group of other dancers from the American 
Ballet Theatre were allowed backstage at the Rolling Stone’s sell-out 
concert in Tokyo’s Dome stadium to be introduced to Mick and the rest of
 the band.

Melanie,
 who is a frequent user of Facebook and Instagram, excitedly posted messages and photos of her trip to Japan, but intriguingly, made no 
mention of the Stones concert.

A
 spokesman for Jagger last night confirmed that the pair met when 
Melanie and the rest of her group were taken backstage. But a source 
close to the star stressed that his first liaison with Melanie did not 
take place until Zurich – and that the pair had merely swapped contact 
details in Tokyo.

The
 week before the concert, on February 25, Jagger had attended a special 
reception for the ballet troupe in Tokyo, hosted by US Ambassador 
Caroline Kennedy, daughter of JFK and a long-standing friend of the rock
 star, but Melanie did not attend.

There was no sign of Ms Scott on the trip, though she had previously travelled with Mick whenever he was on the road.

Ms Hamrick was photographed embracing Jagger on a hotel balcony in Zurich ten days ago, where sources close to the couple say the first 'liaison' took place

At
 the time of the ambassador’s party, Melanie was said to be engaged to 
another older man, 46-year-old José Manuel Carreño, a fellow dancer.

She
 lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, just three miles from the 
home on 11th Avenue that Jagger and Ms Scott shared.  It was there that 
Ms Scott took her life on March 17, at the age of 49.

Mick
 and Melanie were pictured on the balcony of his sprawling penthouse at 
the five-star Dolder Grand Hotel in Zurich earlier this month, looking 
as though they had just got out of bed.

Mick,
 who himself took up ballet several years ago to keep fit, was in a blue
 V-necked sweater, while Melanie grinned next to him in a short-sleeved 
top with slashed sleeves.

During the
 afternoon he ventured out bare chested and alone, apparently to talk on
 the phone. Five hours later he was seen wearing a smart, striped shirt 
and trousers as the dancer stood beside him clutching a glass of water.

The following morning they looked more dishevelled as she stole a kiss from him while sat outside the £2,250-a-night suite.

Melanie Hamrick, 27, met Mick Jagger two weeks before L'Wren Scott's tragic suicide however the exchanged contact details three months earlier when they met in Japan after the Rolling Stones played a sell out gig

Friends of
 Melanie, who has a penchant for older men, did not know why she was in 
Zurich, believing she flew to Switzerland alone. One said: ‘Ever since 
the photos emerged Mel has kept her head down hardly stepping out from 
her apartment.

'Talk has been rife about their fling  with many believing
 it wasn’t just a coincidence the two were in Zurich together following 
the ambassador’s reception in Japan.'

After
 being approached by The Mail on Sunday in New York, Melanie told a friend: ‘They’ve
 found me, they’ve found me!’ But she refused to comment directly.

She
 has been romantically involved with Carreño for six years, and engaged 
since May 2011. They met in 2004, when she joined the American Ballet 
Theatre at the age of 17. He was then the Broadway-based company’s 
premier danseur.

A father 
of two, who was  previously married to fellow Cuban dancer Ana Lourdes 
Novoa, Carreño has been the principal dancer with the English National 
Ballet and the Royal Ballet, and has appeared on Dancing With The Stars,
 America’s version of Strictly Come Dancing.

But
 earlier this year he moved to California – 2,500 miles from Melanie – 
after taking a job as artistic director of Ballet San Jose. In an 
interview in February, the San Francisco Chronicle wrote: ‘Carreno talks
 like a person who has come to the South Bay for the long run, which 
meant leaving behind his fiancee, American Ballet Theatre dancer Melanie
 Hamrick.’

Melanie’s friends have also noted that she has recently stopped wearing the engagement ring she once sported.

The Stones have 17 dates left on their current tour, which will take them around Europe and Scandinavia before they head to Australia and New Zealand.
