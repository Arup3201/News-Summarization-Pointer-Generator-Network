A man who urinated on a war memorial honouring 700 servicemen who died in action has been fined just £100.

David Skinner, 47, was photographed relieving himself against the structure in Margate, Kent, which honours soldiers killed in the First and Second World Wars.

Skinner was fined £100 and ordered to pay a £20 victim surcharge when he appeared before Medway magistrates' court yesterday.

Caught in the act: David Skinner, 47, was photographed urinating on the war memorial in Margate, Kent

He admitted outraging the public decency on Tuesday last week when he appeared before the panel.

One of the names inscribed into the part of the memorial that the man urinated on is Marine Engineering Mechanic Alistair R. Leighton who died aged 19 during the Falklands war when HMS Ardent sank in 1982 after being bombed by the Argentinians' A-4 Skyhawk aircraft.

A number of civilians who died in the local area during World War II are also named on the memorial.

The court case happened as the country prepares to mark 100 years since the start of World War I later this year.

Pamela Pople, chair of the Margate Civic Society said: 'We are quite appalled really - it’s just lack of respect. People laid down their lives and served their country – we are disappointed and disgusted.'

‘I think the public opinion would be very strong on this and people would be equally appalled. I was sent this photo, but I haven’t yet heard about the identity of this person. 

A Royal British Legion spokesman said: 'The Legion is saddened to hear of this senseless incident.

'War memorials and graves honour the 
memory of the British Armed Forces who have made the ultimate sacrifice 
and those who defend the freedom we enjoy.'

Colonel Tim Collins, a former officer from the Royal Irish Regiment, said: 'The value and respect for our nation's servicemen has diminished. Unfortunately you can't legislate for idiots.'

Student Philip Laing, 19, avoided a jail sentence in 2009 after urinating on a war memorial during a mass student bar crawl.

District Judge Anthony Browne, sitting at Sheffield Magistrates' Court sentenced him to 250 hours' community service.

Daniel

poppies to show his remorese after being caught committing the same 
offence.

And Wendy Lewis, 32, from Blackpool, who urinated on the centopath was given a 15-week suspended jail sentence.
