A man who has been walking in reverse for 25 years in a bid to achieve world peace has forgotten how to walk forwards.

Mani Manithan opted to only travel in reverse in 1989 after a string of violent acts in his home country India shocked him into action.

He insists the unusual routine does not interfere with daily life as he has perfected the art of walking backwards up stairs, across roads and while using public transport.

But now Mani, who runs a mobile phone shop in Tiruppatur district, Tamil Nadu, revealed he has forgotten how to walk forwards.

He said: 'Walking normally is more of a challenge - my mind has forgotten how to do it. I have become very comfortable walking like this.

'My life has been full of struggles, sacrifice, achievements and protest so I have no issue continuing my backwards walking until we achieve world peace.'
