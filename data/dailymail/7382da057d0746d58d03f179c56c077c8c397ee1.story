Boris Johnson’s surge in popularity knows no bounds.

Now a new poll reveals the floppy-haired London mayor is now Britain’s most respected political figure – even beating Margaret Thatcher into second place.

The flag-waving, zip-wire riding, whiff-whaff-playing Old Etonian is riding high after his publicty stunt-packed summer as the unofficial face of the London Olympics.

Even getting stuck on an Olympic zip wire 15 feet off the ground failed to dent Boris Johnson's reputation - even anything it was enhanced

A poll for the You-Gov Cambridge conference reveals 58 per cent of voters respect the 48-year-old, the Guardian reported.

By comparison just 46 per cent respected Baroness Thatcher, who was Prime Minister for 11 years, winning three general elections.

David Cameron – who has been dogged by headlines that Mr Johnson is after his job – is respected by only 37 per cent of voters.

George Osborne, the Chancellor of the Exchequer who was booed during the Paralympics, is languishing on just 16 per cent.

Critics will point out that Mr Johnson has never held a major, national political job.

They have suggested Mr Johnson is not a serious figure, whose appeal is limited to London.

But the poll shows he has appeal everywhere - except for Scotland - with more than half of people in the Midlands and northern England saying he has their respect.

In the net score – subtracting the people with no respect for each politician from the proportion who do respect them – Mr Johnson scores +25 points.

George Osborne is on -53 per cent, just behind Nick Clegg on -52. Former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown is on -33, two points lower than Tony Blair’s 31.

Margaret Thatcher has a net respect rating of +1, behind Boris Johnson, but well ahead of Ed Miliband's -29

The highest scoring Labour figure is David Miliband, on -14, well ahead of his brother, Labour leader Ed Miliband , who is on -29.

Vince Cable is the most respect Lib Dem, on -19.

Earlier this week a YouGov poll for The Sun showed the Labour lead over the Tories would be drastically cut from 11 points to just one if Mr Johnson was in charge.
