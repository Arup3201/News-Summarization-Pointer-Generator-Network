Xavi, Andres Iniesta and Clarence Seedorf have lavished praise on Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal after working under the Dutchman during the early stages of their respective careers.

Van Gaal appears to have made a lasting impression on the aforementioned trio having managed Xavi and Iniesta at Barcelona during his two spells at the Nou Camp and Seedorf during his six-year stint as Ajax boss in the 1990s.

Xavi, Iniesta and Seedorf - speaking exclusively to MUTV in an interview which will be screened on Monday night - have lauded Van Gaal's philosophy.

Van Gaal managed fellow countryman Seedorf during his time at Dutch outfit Ajax in the 1990s

'For sure he is a coach who knows how to pass on his philosophy to his teams,' said Seedorf.

'And I think what you have seen that with the Ajax spirit when I played there - that's Van Gaal.

'Instead of buying many players you can always fill your first team with your own players who know the club culture, who know the club tactics and have lived for so long that everything for them is natural.

'He is a great coach and his record speaks for itself.'

Xavi, who was given his Barcelona debut by Van Gaal back in 1998, and club team-mate Iniesta echoed Seedorf's comments regarding the Dutch tactician.

'Well my personal experience with him was great,' said Xavi. 'He gave me the opportunity to join the first team and he gave me a lot of confidence the whole time.

'I worked with him and he really put his faith in me. He pushed me into the first team at 17 and helped me so much through that difficult journey.

Barcelona midfielder Xavi has also lauded Van Gaal for promoting him into the Catalan giants' first team 

Andres Iniesta has thanked the Manchester United boss for helping him make an 'important step' in his career

'In my opinion he didn't get the credit he deserved at Barcelona. He had very clear ideas and was very methodical. He was a coach who was ahead of his time.'

Iniesta added: 'I was 17 years of age and delighted to be in the first team, and he gave me that opportunity. I knew that he had always done tremendous work with the young players.

'I was excited to work with him and take such an important step in my career. He's hard working, honest, sincere. Above all, he's a hugely successful manager who's done great things in the game.'

Current Manchester United stars Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Victor Valdes will also reflect on working under Van Gaal during the MUTV documentary.
