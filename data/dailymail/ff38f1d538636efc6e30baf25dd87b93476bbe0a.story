Levi Aron, the 'butcher of Brooklyn', is expected to plead guilty next week after he admitted to the murder of eight-year-old Leiby Kletzky who was abducted last July.

The deal on the table means that 36-year-old Aron will be sentenced to 40 years to life and never be released.

Aron, is accused of 
smothering and dismembering Leiby after snatching him in a Hasidic neighborhood of Brooklyn on July 11, 2011. The eight-year-old had been walking home alone for the first time, when he got lost and stopped to ask Aron for directions.

Under the deal, Aron would enter a guilty plea to murder, receiving up to life in prison, plus another 15 years for kidnap.

He is due back in the Supreme Court of Brooklyn on August 9.

Assemblyman Dov Hikind, who has been speaking on behalf of the Kletzky family, told the New York Daily News: 'The family has to live with this for the rest of their lives. They want to bring this to a conclusion.

'The idea of having a trial was not something that they wanted to go through. They want to make sure that there is justice.'

However Mr Hikind added that until the deal was officially announced, there was the possibility that a trial could go ahead if Aron changed his mind. 

There was no comment from Aron's defense lawyers on the expected plea deal. 

Last July, Leiby got lost on his walk home from a yeshiva - religious day camp - and asked Aron, whom he met on the street, for help.

It was the first time the child had been allowed to walk home alone.

He was supposed to walk just seven blocks to
meet his mother but missed a turn.

Aron,
a hardware supply store clerk, took the boy home where they watched TV before the boy fell asleep, police said.

Leiby remained there the next day when Aron went to work - and a frantic search was taking place in the community for the lost boy.

It is then believed that Aron smothered the boy and dismembered his body.

The confessed killer told detectives his victim put up a struggle and that afterwards he was hearing voices telling him ‘to take his own life for what he did’.

Aron allegedly carved up the boy's 
body with knives and disposed of body parts, including severed feet 
found wrapped in plastic his freezer.

The rest of the boy's body was discovered in bags inside a red suitcase in a trash bin two miles from Aron's home. His legs had been cut from his torso.

Aron, who has grown massively obese while on Riker's Island, was allegedly suffering from psychotic episodes and placed on suicide watch.

A further statement from the victim's family will be read when Aron returns to court next week.
