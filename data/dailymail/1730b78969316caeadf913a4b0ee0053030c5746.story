With its googly eyes and flapping tentacles, it's certainly a strange thing to see bobbing in the sky.  

But onlookers had no cause for alarm at the sight of this 'Mollusk Octopus' - as it's actually the largest kite in the world.

At 110 metres long, 15 metres wide, and weighing 200kg, it stole the show at the Hohhot First Kite Festival in Xilamuren, China, earlier this week.

This huge, 200kg octopus is the largest kite in the world and covers an area of 1,500 square metres when spread out on the ground 

The 110m-long and 15m-wide kite was on show at the Hohhot First Festival in China on Tuesday, which saw teams from all over the world flying their kites

Covering an area of 1,500 square metres when spread out on the ground, it was designed and made by the Heige Kite Team from Tianjin, in central China, in 2013. 

To get it skywards, it required a mammoth struggle, with more than 30 people helping to bring the octopus into the air. 

The record-breaking kite was one of 35 teams from all over the world that took part in the spectacle in the Inner Mongolian region, 90km north of Hohhot city.   

As well as the huge octopus, there were also panda-shaped kites, teddy bear kites and a Father Christmas one on show at the gala on Tuesday.
