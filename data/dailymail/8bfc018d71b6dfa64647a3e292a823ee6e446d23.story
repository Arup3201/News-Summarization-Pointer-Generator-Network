A young mother today demanded an apology from retail giant Sports Direct after she was ordered to leave one of their stores because she was breastfeeding.

Wioletta Komar claims she was left in tears outside the shop in Nottingham city centre while trying to feed her three-month-old son in the rain.

The 25-year-old had been sitting on a bench inside the store waiting for her father Edward Morawiec, 63, who was trying on a T-shirts.

But she claims a member of staff suddenly marched over and told her that breastfeeding mothers were not welcome because of 'company policy'.

 an apology: Mrs Komar says she was sitting on a bench inside the store

was 'against company policy'

The sales assistant then told her that
 the store had no facilities for her and suggested she should go to 
McDonald's which had a baby and mother room.

Other
 customers then took pity on the mother-of-two and helped her to push 
her buggy outside so she could continue feeding Daniel.

Mrs
 Komar said she had contacted the company five times since the incident 
on January 25 but had received no response to her complaint.

She said: 'My son started crying, so I wanted to feed him. I sat on the bench near the shoe rack.

'The
 store assistant approached me and said, "I'm sorry but you will have to
 go out. You can't feed here. That is our company policy".

'I would like the staff to be trained better and I would like them to say why it happened. I would like them to apologise.

'Made to feel like a criminal': The 25-year-old was told the store had no facilities for her and suggested she should go to nearby McDonald's which had a baby and mother room

'It made me feel very upset - I was 
shaking and I didn't know what to do. I knew that I was allowed to be 
there, but what could I do?

'It's very shocking. Of course it's knocked my confidence. You don't expect it, never.'

The
 Polish-born mother lives in Boston, Lincolnshire, with her husband 
Zbigniew, 33, and their sons Wictor, two, and Daniel, who is now 
five-months-old.

She had 
travelled to Nottingham for a weekend shopping with Daniel and her 
father Edward as a Christmas present from her husband.

She added: 'I was meant to be enjoying a weekend shopping and we were staying in the Hilton.

'But I obviously didn't enjoy myself and it was ruined.

'I have phoned them (Sports Direct) myself three times to chase the progress of it and was told that it is in process. In my opinion they don't treat it seriously.

'Midwives and doctors say that it (breastfeeding) is best for the child but I feel so upset and frustrated about what has happened.

'I can't understand why a baby has to be punished for being hungry and why I need to feel like a criminal when I just want to feed my baby son.'

Mrs Komar has also received support from other mothers including Laura Whatton - who was ejected from the John Carroll Leisure Centre in Nottingham in 2009.

Mrs Whatton, who received an apology, said: 'I'm not surprised really.

'Everyone is prudish toward it, even though it's the most natural thing in the world.'

Patti Rundall, policy director for Baby Milk Action, added: 'All mothers have a legally-protected right to breastfeed in public.

'It is important, it's their right and we will do what we can to support them.'

The Equality Act 2010 states that it is discrimination to treat a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding.

The act protects women who want to do so in shops or other public places.

Sports Direct declined to comment.

Wioletta Komar's experience is the latest in a number of incidents where mothers have been told to stop breastfeeding in public.

In March, Heather Vaughan, 29, told how she was reduced to tears when staff at a naval museum ordered her to stop feeding her baby in its creche, telling her 'we donâ€™t do that here'.

The mother-of-two said she felt victimised and humiliated at the museum in the Portsmouth Historic Dockyard.

Bosses apologised, saying it had simply been an 'error of judgment'.

Last October, a midwife spoke out after she was told to stop breastfeeding in a public swimming pool because the lifeguard thought it was 'offensive'.

Sophie Howes was sat on the steps of the learner pool with her eight-month-old daughter Connie at a leisure centre in Ashford, Kent, when she was ordered to move.

The manager of the centre claims that CCTV footage shows Ms Howes breastfeeding Connie while the baby's head was level with the water in the pool.

But the mother said: 'It is irrelevant whether I was in the water or not because that is not what the staff member said to me to begin with.

'She didn't mention health and safety issues, she just said one of her colleagues had been offended by me breastfeeding.'

Also in that month, supermarket giant Morrisons was forced to apologise to a mother after asking her to breastfeed her baby in the disabled toilets, which she described as 'grubby and dirty'.

Michelle Garner, 31, was stunned when staff at her local store in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Notts., told her she should feed her six-week-old daughter Lois in the supermarket washroom.

In another case, a mother was forced to hit back at her critics after a picture of her breastfeeding in public was posted online calling her a 'tramp'.

Emily Slough, 27, was horrified when a stranger took a picture of her breastfeeding her daughter Matilda on the steps of a restaurant and uploaded it to Facebook.

Her story caused a storm online and she was even branded a 'peasant' by an 'etiquette expert' on a local radio show.

She hit back at critics, saying: 'I was showing a lot less flesh than a lot of people do - I wasn't sitting there with my breast out.

'Breastfeeding mums aren't doing it to antagonise people or gain attention - they are doing it to meet their babies' needs.'
