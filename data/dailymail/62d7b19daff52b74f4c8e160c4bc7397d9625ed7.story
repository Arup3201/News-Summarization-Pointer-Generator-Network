A photographer whose unforgettable image of a crowd of people watching in horror as the World Trade Center burned is trying to locate his subjects.

Patrick Witty was on the scene in Manhattan’s Financial District 12 years ago and the image he caught has since been published dozens of times worldwide.

Since starting his quest on September 11 last year, Witty has identified two of the people in his iconic photo, but he’s nowhere near finished.

Engaging: Twelve years later, Patrick Witty, the man who snapped this iconic photo of horrified onlookers in Lower Manhattan on September 11, 2001, wants to meet his subjects

‘I want to know them all,’ Witty wrote on Time.com’s Lightbox blog.

The photographer is now the international photo editor for Time magazine. On September 11, 2001, he was a freelance photographer living in Manhattan’s Lower East Side.

‘I heard screaming on the roof of my building, and went up and saw the World Trade Center on fire,’ Witty told Yahoo News. ‘When the second plane hit, I grabbed my camera gear and went down there.’

Witty stayed and took photos of the ash-covered aftermath until the police kicked him out.

Found: Benjamin Tabile is pictured here with unidentified family. He is one of the two subjects of Witty's photo who've come forward since the photographer began searching for names to put with the faces

What they saw: Witty's subjects were looking up just as the South Tower began to collapse

But it is just one of his pictures that has become a part of the nation’s collective consciousness, a photo he calls ‘a cross-section of New Yorkers, united in terror, standing at Park Row and Beekman Street in lower Manhattan.’

Last year, Witty posted his photo on Facebook and Twitter in the hopes of contacting each and every person he captured on film that day.

‘After it was shared more than 10,000 times,’ he said. ‘I now know two of them.’

One of those people is Benjamin Tabile.

Witty was contacted by Tabile’s son Edward after he posted his photo on September 11 last year.

Tabile is the man at the center of the photograph wearing glasses. He looks more shocked than the others, and with good reason.

He was on his way to the World Trade Center that day for a job interview, but was running late.

‘As I walked out of the subway, I saw the building on fire and didn’t know why,’ he told Time. ‘I was in complete shock. I would have been in that building while the planes hit.’

Witty believes there are other stories like that contained in his photo and he wants to hear them.

He urges anyone who recognizes someone in the photo to reach him at patrick_witty@timemagazine.com. He’s also on Twitter @patrickwitty.
