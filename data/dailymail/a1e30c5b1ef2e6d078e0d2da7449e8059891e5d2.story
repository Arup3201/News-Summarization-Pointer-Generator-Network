Dozens of civil servants have found themselves in deep trouble after surfing the internet for porn while they were meant to be working.

A total of 55 workers at the Welsh Government's offices were looking at explicit photographs and videos at their desks.

Disciplinary action was taken against the officials after the material was found on their computers.

Caught: 55 Welsh government workers, some of whom may have been based at its HQ in Cardiff (pictured), have looked at porn at work

One senior manager was forced to resign after it was revealed in 2008 he had been looking at child pornography.

Two years later police were also called in when another worker, who was sacked, looked at illegal extreme porn.

Top employment lawyers are recommending offices ban porn because it's distracting the bureaucrats from their work.

Employment solicitor Leanne Thomas said: 'More than one in four people have admitted to watching inappropriate content online in the workplace.

'When it comes to porn, organisations are sitting on a potential time bomb.

'While accessing porn is not illegal the risks associated with last brand damage and employee harassment litigation are significant.

'The best cure is prevention and many workplaces ban access to, and the passing around of, inappropriate material in the office.'

Information released by the Welsh Government revealed 55 workers have been disciplined for downloading porn.

Fifteen civil servants were disciplined for downloading images showing sexy or full nudity and another 31 staff were caught looking at topless pictures.

The stats, released under the freedom of information act, cover porn use over the past five years.

A Welsh Government spokesman said: 'We take the inappropriate use of our IT systems very seriously.

'And we have robust policies in place to deal with such cases.'
