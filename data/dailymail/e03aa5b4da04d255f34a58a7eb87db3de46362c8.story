Gus Poyet is facing a battle to keep strikers Steven Fletcher and Connor Wickham at Sunderland.

Hull boss Steve Bruce is eyeing Fletcher as replacement for Shane Long, while Wickham was this week the subject of a £5million bid from West Ham.

Poyet, whose side kick off at West Brom on Saturday afternoon, is determined not to sell either player and would still like to add Liverpool’s Fabio Borini to his attacking personnel.

Wanted man: West Ham have launched a £5million bid for Sunderland striker Connor Wickham

The Uruguayan said: ‘I think they (bids) are going to come for someone. I hope not.

‘That last day of the transfer window is terrible. You don’t want to answer the phone or check your emails. You don’t want anything unexpected.’

Fletcher is set to lead the line at the Hawthorns, and Poyet added: ‘I think it will be his year, I am absolutely convinced.

‘There is no pressure on Fletch because he knows when you wear the No 9 at any club in the world you need to perform and score goals, but I think it is probably the best he has been physically in the last three or four years. It’s perfect for him to go and perform.’

Wickham, meanwhile, is in the last year of his contract and could leave if a new deal is not agreed.

‘For me, I think he is going to stay with us,’ said Poyet. ‘It’s tough because I would like to know that from now, I would love to concentrate on the games and that’s it.’

A £14m bid for Borini has been accepted by Liverpool, but the Italian is still assessing his options and has not yet given Sunderland an answer one way or the other.

Poyet said: ‘Every now and then I like to say “that’s it”, but then I say “no, no, we’ll give him a few more days”. But we are getting close.’

Undecided: Fabio Borini is yet to make his mind up as to whether to join Sunderland or stay at Liverpool
