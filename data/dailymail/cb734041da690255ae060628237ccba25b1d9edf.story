A migration brain drain has left Britain with a workforce in which millions cannot understand arithmetic, a study found.

Nearly 700,000 highly numerate Britons have left the country for a life abroad since the mid-1960s, figures published yesterday show.

Meanwhile, almost two-and-a-half million people arrived in the UK with few skills and low levels of numeracy.

The large number of low-skilled arrivals – compared to a far smaller group of highly numerate immigrants – has brought down the average skill level of Britain’s workforce, a new study shows. Pictured are migrants in Calais

The large number of low-skilled arrivals – compared to a far smaller group of highly numerate immigrants – has brought down the average skill level of Britain’s workforce, the Institute of Education found. Its report said that as a result of the population changes, one in four of the adults in Britain that do not fully understand numbers are immigrants.

The findings undermine claims that mass immigration has brought in much-needed skilled professionals to help the economy. Instead, a large proportion of incoming migrants have been people more likely to take low-paid jobs.

Many of the low-skilled migrants have come from South Asia and Africa, while highly educated arrivals predominantly come from South Asia and Europe, the report said. The study, published in advance of the release of new immigration statistics today, was based on figures from 24 countries gathered by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

Its research covered 166,000 people – nearly 9,000 of them living in Britain.

In a numeracy test, emigrants from Britain scored 268 points, while people who moved neither out of nor into the country scored just lower – 267. However, immigrants into Britain scored an average of 234.

The Institute of Education found that between the mid-1960s and 2011 there were 684,000 highly numerate Britons who left the country. An almost equal number of mathematically skilled immigrants arrived in Britain – but a further 2.4million came with poor numeracy skills.

Study author Dr John Jerrim said: ‘Immigrants account for one in four of the 9.6million working-age adults living in the UK with low-level numeracy skills. Immigration has therefore had its biggest impact upon the bottom end of the numeracy skill distribution; it has led to a significant increase in the supply of low-skilled workers.’

The study found skilled British workers often found better paid jobs abroad.

Those who left for the US and Australia were earning on average £2,580 a month in 2011 – roughly £500 more than their counterparts in Britain.
