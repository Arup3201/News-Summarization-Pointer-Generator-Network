Rain is set to return to Britain this week, hours after crowds of sun-seekers raced to the beaches to enjoy the warm weather at the end of half-term.

London basked in temperatures of 20C (68F) yesterday - while Kingston-upon-Hull in East Yorkshire was the hottest place in the country at 22.5C (73F).

Thousands of people made the most of the heat on beaches across the country after an overcast week - but rain will be back today for most of the UK.

Day out: Lily Gillingham, Jeane Geogh and Viv Chant make the most of the hot weather yesterday in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset

Beach huts: People made the most of the 18C heat yesterday afternoon in Bournemouth, Dorset, after an overcast week

Colourful: Wild poppies add a touch of colour along the sand dunes near Bamburgh Castle in Northumberland on the North East coast

The pier in Bournemouth, Dorset, was a hive of activity yesterday as people enjoyed the views and watched a jet-ski championship taking place.

Claire Jones, 36, from Christchurch, travelled to Bournemouth beach yesterday with her children Max, aged five, and Lily, seven.

She said: ‘When I opened my curtains and saw the sunshine and blue skies I knew we had to make the most of it.

‘We've been making sandcastles and enjoyed some fish and chips sitting on the beach which was lovely. We've also been paddling in the sea.’

Next three days: The glorious weather is not expected to last into this week, with forecasters expecting things to become unsettled again

Good day for an ice cream: People make the most of the hot weather on the last day of half term in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset

Two wheels: Brodie Souter, five, scooters along the promenade as people make the most of the hot weather in Weston-super-Mare

But the glorious weather is not expected to last into this week, with forecasters expecting things to become unsettled again.

Met Office forecaster Emma Compton said: ‘We will have a relatively mild night but it will all change from today and through the coming week.

‘We can expect to see patchy rain throughout the day on Monday and it will be rather unpleasant and dull.

‘Later on in the week we can expect the weather to be quite unsettled and we are looking at heavy showers interspersed with sunshine.’

Weston-super-Mare: The Met Office - which has no severe weather warnings in place this week - said yesterday was the start of summer in the meteorological calendar

Pretty: Visitors to Redworth Hall Hotel in County Durham look at a 'handkerchief tree'- named in recognition of the large white flowers that cascade from the branches

The Met Office - which has no severe weather warnings in place this week - said yesterday was the start of summer in the meteorological calendar.

UK averages for June, July and August since records began show that the wettest summer was in 1912, with 384mm (15.1in) of rain falling.

The driest saw just 103mm (4.1in) in 1995 - while the warmest was an average of 15.8C (60F) in 2006, and the coldest was 12.3C (54F) in 1922.

The Environment Agency had six flood alerts in place last night - one for the River Foulness in East Yorkshire, and another five in the South East.

Today: It is forecast to be a largely cloudy day across the UK with showery rain at times for most places, although very little rain will fall across south-east England. Turning somewhat brighter across Wales and south-west England during the afternoon with scattered showers.

Tonight: It will be largely cloudy throughout the night with showery outbreaks of rain. The rain is expected to become heavy and persistent at times in eastern areas.

Tomorrow: There will be rather a lot of cloud about but also with some sunny intervals and showers. However, longer spells of rain are expected in the far East.

Wednesday: Expect spells of rain in the south and across north-west Scotland with sunny spells and showers elsewhere.
