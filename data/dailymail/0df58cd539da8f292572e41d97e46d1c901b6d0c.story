The old record, set in 2012, was 60 peeps in two minutes.

On Friday, Matt Stonie, engaged in the gooey challenge, eating a combination of both yellow — the original — and pink colored of the marshsmallow candy that is shaped like a chick. The candy is specially popular around Easter, when the manufacturer, Just Born, comes out with bunny Peeps.

Just 15 seconds in, competitive eater Matt Stonie has already consumed 17 marsmallow peeps

Christie's lips have turned red from the pink colored Peeps he ate, as he finishes the last of 100 Peeps in just over two minutes

Stonie is in some discomfort after he ate 100 Peeps in two minutes and 10 seconds

More than 700 million of the candy chicks and bunnies are consumed annually in the United States.

In a video posted on YouTube, unwrapped packages of Peeps can be seen before Stonei dumps them onto a kitchen counter. He then stacks the Peeps up neatly. When he starts eating, he put a row of five Peeps in his mouth at a time.

A counter in the upper left hand corner keeps count. Dramatic music featuring drums plays in the background. In between eating rows, Stonie takes a drink from a small cup. 

The 100 Peeps are laid out on a kitchen counter before Stonie devoured them.

An estimated 700 millions Peeps, made by Just Born, are eaten every year in the U.S.

At one point, Stonie spits up a Peep, but quickly puts it back in his mouth and keeps on eating.

When the 100th Peep is eaten, a stopwatch reads two minutes and 10 seconds. However, Stonie is not pleased.

'Damnit, I wanted two minutes,' he says. 'Not very good.'

Stonie is not an amateur competitive eater. He has participated in eating challenges involving tacos, Big Macs (five in 60 seconds) and the legendary Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest held every July 4th in Coney Island, Brooklyn, New York. 

Stonie doesn't have much time to rest up before his next contest either. He will defend his title in a fried asparagus eating contest on April 26. 

Around Easter, some cities are known to host Peeps eating contests known as Peep Offs. The first one was held in Maryland in 2004. And there are also Peeps competitions where people use the candy as characters in dioramas.
