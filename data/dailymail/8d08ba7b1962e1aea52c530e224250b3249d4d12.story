He's better known for the design of the vertiginous red-soled shoes coveted across the globe.

This month though, legendary designer Christian Louboutin flexes his creative muscle in a different direction as he conjures up his dream cocktail bar for the Grey Goose Winter Ball to benefit the Elton John foundation.

Dubbed the Crazy Luxor bar, the sculptural piece is shaped like a stiletto and is finished in a high shine black lacquer with, it stands to reason, a red trim to echo the designer's signature red sole (always worked in Pantone's 186c, fact fans).

Christian Louboutin has designed a bar which will be auctioned off at the Goose Winter Ball to benefit the Elton John AIDS Foundation later this month

The ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics on the facade of the bar are in honour of Louboutin's love of Egypt - he owns properties in the country and visits twice a year to gather inspiration for his lines.The bar will go on auction at the Architecture of Taste-themed ball, to be held on 29 October in Battersea Park, London.

As part of the prize, the winner will also be given a cocktail party on the date of their choice to be held at their home, with cocktails served by a mixologist from their brand new Louboutin bar. Oh, and they'll get a pair of Louboutin shoes thrown in for good measure. 

Previous names who have been behind the design of the bar include Jean Paul Gaultier, Elizabeth Hurley and Lily Allen, whose Lil Box of Tracks bar (the bar opened up to reveal DJ turntables and leather seating) fetched a record Â£100,000 at the 2009 auction.

The bar is lacquered in a glossy black with a red trim to echo the designer's signature red soles

Also taking part in the event will be fashion week darling Jonathan Saunders, who has been drafted in to design the uniforms for all of the staff attending the event in the style of his autumn/winter 2011 collection.

Playing his part in the auction, the London-based designer has donated a cocktail dress and personall fitting to the lucky winner, who will also be given a golden ticket to sit frotn row at the next Jonathan Saunders fashion show.

Both designers have also designed a cocktail to be served at the event. 

Other highlights of the evening include dinner by internationally acclaimed Catalan restaurant el Bulli and auction lots from British artist Marc Quinn.

Past guests have included Erin O'Connor, Gemma Arterton, Daisy Lowe, Liz Hurley, Roisin Murphy and Tamara Ecclestone.

Tickets are available to purchase in benefit of the Elton John AIDS Foundation, by contacting the charity on 020 7603 9996.

100 per cent of the ticket price is donated directly to the Elton John AIDS Foundation.
