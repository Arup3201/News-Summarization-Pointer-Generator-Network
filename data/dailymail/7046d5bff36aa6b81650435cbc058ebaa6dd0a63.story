A teenager was left with a two inch hole burned into his arm – after he fell asleep lying on his iPhone.

Jake Parker, from Wokingham in Berkshire, was lying in bed using his iPhone 5  after a long work shift when he fell asleep.

After the 18-year-old had woken up the next morning, his mother Tammie, 43, pointed out that he had a large blister on his arm.

Jake, a keen rugby player, said he then picked up the gadget and knew it had caused the injury as it was ‘really hot’.

Doctors told the factory night worker to take antibiotics after the wound became infected – but the teenager had to go to hospital after the sore turned black, leaving him in excruciating pain.

The Sun reports that the blister then burst and left him with a gaping hole down to his muscle. Now he has been told he will be scarred for life.

He said: ‘I was just texting, looking at Facebook – normal stuff.

‘Now every time I move my arm it’s like ripping open. At one point I could see the muscle moving.’

He added that doctors told him they had ‘never seen anything’ like the injury and suggested he return to see them because it ‘could be a radiation burn’.
