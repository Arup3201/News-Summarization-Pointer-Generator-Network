Up to 10,000 women took to the streets of Cairo yesterday to protest against the horrific abuse by soldiers.

They were surrounded by a cordon of male protesters as they marched through the centre of Egypt’s capital.

And their actions forced an apology from the military regime behind the violence of the past five days.

Anger: The protest is one of the first to be led by women - though many had male chaperones

Many carried shocking pictures of 
women being dragged by the hair, kicked and stripped – including the 
‘girl in the blue bra’ who was kicked and beaten with metal bars.

‘They say they are here to protect us,
but they are stripping us naked,’ the marchers chanted. Even before the
demonstration was over, the military council governing the country 
issued an apology for what it called ‘violations’.

It expressed ‘deep regret to the great
women of Egypt’ and reaffirmed ‘its respect and total appreciation for 
the women of Egypt and their right to protest, effectively and 
positively participate in the political life on the road to the 
democratic transition’.

And it promised it was taking measures to punish those responsible for violations.

Demands: Anger has been mounted over the military government's heavy-handed treatment of demonstrations

United: The women came together from all social and religious backgrounds

But the protesters have little faith in their rulers.

The attacks came during clashes since 
Friday as troops broke up protests by activists demanding the end to the
rule of the military, which took power after the fall of Hosni Mubarak 
in February.

Clashes saw military police chasing 
young men and women through Tahrir Square and nearby streets, beating 
them with clubs and sticks.

The images of abuse drew harsh words 
from U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who described them 
as ‘a systematic degradation of Egyptian women’.

'They say they are here to protect us, but they are stripping us naked,' the marchers chanted.

'The girl dragged around is just like my daughter. They do that and then call us thugs,' said Um Hossam, a 54-year old woman in traditional black dress and a veil. 'I am a free woman and attacking this woman or killing protesters is just like going after one of my own children.'

Yesterday morning, in the second dawn raid in as many days, troops and riot police descended on Cairo's Tahrir Square in a bid to evict protesters.

Dr Ahmed Saad, a volunteer at the field hospital in the square, said a 15-year-old was in a critical condition after being shot.

Violence: Egyptian protesters hurl rocks at security forces with one holding a stolen riot shield. At least 14 people have been killed since clashes erupted on Friday

Egypt's general are coming under mounting criticism over the excessive use of force by troops against unarmed protesters, including women.

Since the latest outbreak of violence on Friday, at least 14 protesters have been killed.

Security forces initially succeeded in removing protesters from the square, but they returned a short time later using a different route.

They then pulled out following clashes in which protesters hurled rocks at them.

The military took power after an 18-day uprising forced long-time leader Hosni Mubarak to step down 10 months ago.

They have since been accused by activists and rights groups of mismanaging the transition period, human rights abuses and failing to revive the ailing economy or restore security.

On Monday, a member of the military council sought to discredit the revolutionaries behind the ongoing protests and spoke of a conspiracy to 'topple the state'

Major General Adel Emara defended the use of force by troops and refused to apologise for the brutality shown, particularly toward female protesters.

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, addressing students at Georgetown University yesterday, accused security forces of specifically targeting women.

'And now, women are being attacked, stripped and beaten in the streets,' she said.

'This systematic degradation of Egyptian women dishonours the revolution, disgraces the state and its uniform and is not worthy of a great people.'

Navi Pillay, UN human rights chief, called on ruling generals to arrest and prosecute officials behind the crackdown.

Some newspapers in Egypt have been critical of the crackdown.

Independent Al-Tahrir featured a composite picture of Maj Gen Emara addressing a news conference with the iconic image of soldiers stamping and beating a half-naked woman behind him.

Mocking his use of the patriotic card in defence of their record, the words 'Egypt always come first' are written below the image.

But others have reacted angrily to further protests. A retired army general told a newspaper this week that the protesters should be thrown into 'Hitler's ovens' - a reference to the gas chambers used by Nazi Germany in the Holocaust.
