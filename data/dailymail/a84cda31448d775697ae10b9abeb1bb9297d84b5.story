Breaking the law in old age may be a sign of dementia, doctors warn.

Criminal activites including theft, traffic violations, sexual advances, trespassing, and public urination, are common signs of the disease, especially in older adults who are first-time offenders.

Older adults whose personality appears to have changed or who engage in criminal behaviours might be doing so because their brain is becoming damaged by dementia.

Violence is one of the first symptoms of a little known type of dementia, but this condition is not often recognised by health providers or the authorities, researchers said.

Doctors warn criminal behaviour including theft, traffic violations, sexual advances, trespassing, and public urination in older people could be a sign of a rare type of dementia

Ad a result, family and friends who notice a relative who is acting outside of the norm should seek a medical evaluation as they may have a degenerative brain disease underlying their behaviour.

The U.S. researchers reviewed the medical records of 2,397 patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease or other types of dementia between 1999 and 2012.

They scanned patient notes for entries about criminal behaviour using keywords like 'arrest,' 'Driving Under the Influence (DUI),' 'shoplift' and 'violence' and uncovered 204 patients, or 8.5 per cent, who qualified.

The researchers concluded their behaviours were more often an early sign of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD).

This is a rare type of dementia which can sometimes cause inappropriate behaviour in social situations,

Frontotemporal dementia is similar to Alzheimer's disease in that it is caused by a build up of abnormal proteins in the brain, leading to a progressive loss of brain cells, and the affected areas functioning less well and shrinking.

But it affects the frontal lobes of the brain, behind the forehead – which regulate our ability to plan and organise, and are important in regulating our behaviour.

It also affects the temporal lobes on either side of the brain, which organise memory and language.

This type of dementia causes slowly progressive problems with language, thinking, emotions and behaviour, and can profoundly alter a person's character and social conduct.

It was also more often an early sign of another type of dementia called 'primary progressive aphasia' (PPA), a type of language-deteriorating dementia, than of Alzheimer's.

Of the 'criminal' group of 204 patients, 64 had frontotemporal dementia, 24 had primary progressive aphasia, 42 had Alzheimer's, and the rest had various other forms of dementia.

Patients with frontotemporal dementia or primary progressive aphasia tended to be younger, averaging 59 to 63 years old.

This is compared to Alzheimer's patients, who were an average age of 71 when their doctors made notes about criminal behaviours.

Researchers analysed the medical records of patients with dementia between 1992 and 2012 and found many of the patients who had engaged in criminal behaviour had frontotemporal dementia. Violence is a common sign of this type of degenerative disease

Frontotemporal dementia is a rare type of dementia caused by a build-up of abnormal proteins in the brain.

The term 'dementia' describes a loss of mental ability that is more than would be expected with ageing. It is sufficient to affect day-to-day activities and gets progressively worse.

Frontotemporal dementia is similar to Alzheimer's disease in that it is caused by a build-up of abnormal proteins in the brain, leading to a progressive loss of brain cells. 

The affected areas of the brain gradually function less well and shrink.

It tends to affect the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain (the front and sides) in particular, and often starts at a younger age than usually seen in Alzheimer's disease.

The frontal lobes are at the front of the brain, behind the forehead – they regulate our ability to plan and organise ourselves and are important in regulating our behaviour.

The temporal lobes are on either side of the brain above and behind the ears, and they organise memory and language.  

Generally, frontotemporal dementia causes slowly progressive problems with language, thinking, emotions and behaviour.

It can profoundly alter a person's character and social conduct – for example, they may either become impulsive and much more outgoing, or uninterested and lacking in energy, depending on the type of disease they have.

Other typical symptoms include inappropriate behaviour in social situations and difficulty with speech.

Frontotemporal dementia typically starts between the ages of 45 and 65, although it can sometimes affect younger people as well as the elderly.

More than 6.4 per cent of those in the 'criminal group' with frontotemporal dementia exhibited physical or verbal violence during their illness.

But this was only seen in 3.4 percent of those with PPA and two percent of those with Alzheimer's disease, the researchers found.

In four per cent of patients with frontotemporal dementia, violence was one of the first symptoms of their brain disease.

Men were considerably more likely than women to make sexual advances to others and to urinate in public. 

The study's lead author, Dr. Georges Naasan of the University of California,  U.S., said if patients have a family history of dementia, it may be possible to connect new criminal behaviour to an underlying problem with the brain.

'However, most of these diseases are "sporadic" - meaning they occur for no identifiable genetic cause and it is difficult to predict,' he said.

'In general, an early detection of changes in personality, deviation from what constituted a "norm" for a particular individual, should prompt an evaluation for possible brain causes.'

Early signs of frontotemporal dementia can include personality changes including disinhibition, lack of empathy, loss of motivation or apathy, or obsessive-compulsive behaviour, he said.

'It is sometimes hard to wrap our minds around the concept that a specific part of our brain is not functioning properly, leading to behaviours that may range the gamut of disruptive, detached and sometimes criminal,' Dr Naasan said.

Family and friends can easily take these behaviour changes personally, but they should understand that it may be the first sign of a disease and should request a medical evaluation, he added. 

Frontotemporal dementia spectrum disorders can be accurately diagnosed with positron emission tomography (PET) scans and neuropsychological testing.

However this can only happen if doctors recognise it could be the cause of the behaviour and think to test for it, Dr Hassan said. 

The study was published in the journal JAMA Neurology.
