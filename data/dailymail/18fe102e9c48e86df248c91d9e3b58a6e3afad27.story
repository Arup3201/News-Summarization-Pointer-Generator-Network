A woman's outrage over the lack of hospital beds has gone viral after she posted a photo of her terminally ill sister - a chemotherapy patient - lying on the floor of a hospital.

The photo shows Amanda Veitch covered in a blanket and a jacket substituted as a pillow at Gold Coast University Hospital.

It was posted on Facebook by Lisa Maree on Saturday and gained wide-spread attention on social media.

'Could they not find some type of bed??? She is full of chemotherapy and at high risk of infection!!,' Ms Maree captioned the photo which was first obtained by the Gold Coast Bulletin.

'Like and share if you think this is unacceptable.'

Since then, the image has gained 736 shares from Ms Maree's page.

She also commented on the photo, saying that her sister was in emergency as she was 'in a bit of pain' but was told by staff that she had to wait her turn.

'She has a card that she shows them so she is sent to her own room but apparently thay [sic] said she needs to wait on the priority list like everyone else!' Ms Maree said.

'They are risking her life!' one friend wrote.

Another said: 'How ridiculous, a new hospital and they can't even manage to find a bed for her'.

Gold Coast Health Executive Director Operations, Jane Hancock, said the hospital deeply regreted the circumstances and was investigating the issue.

'We apologise unreservedly and are reviewing our processes to try to ensure this situation doesnâ€™toccur for any of our patients,' Ms Hancock said.

'Whilst not an excuse, there were particular circumstances that contributed to this unfortunateoccurrence. Gold Coast University Hospital experienced a high volume of patients through theemergency department on Saturday including a major road accident with casualties brought to thehospital via helicopter.'
