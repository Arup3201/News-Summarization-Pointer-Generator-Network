A Syrian election branded as a farce by opponents of President Bashar al-Assad is planned for tomorrow despite the ongoing civil war. 

In theory, 15 million people are entitled to vote but polling stations are only being opened in areas loyal to the current regime.

This comes as Government forces have discovered secret tunnels used by rebels to move explosives and arms in advance of tomorrow's election.

Pro-government forces today discovered a series of tunnels dug by rebels in advance of tomorrow's planned election

Rebels dug tunnels and blasted holes in buildings in the eastern outskirts of Damascus where they were preparing to attack government forces

The tunnels allowed rebels to move unseen below ground and away from fighter bombers and helicopters patrolling the area

Pro-regime newspaper Al-Watan said: 'Military and security forces are on maximum alert to ensure the security of Syrians who wish to vote.'

The regime claims that more than 9,000 polling stations are being protected although there are claims that rebel forces may target electors queuing to cast their ballots. 

On Monday, ten people were killed in Haraqui when a truck bomb exploded in the village which is loyal to the current regime.

In Aleppo, which has been the scene of intense fighting, 50 people, including nine children, were killed in mortar attacks believed to have been fired by rebels, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

The Syrian army believes that he tunnels would have been used in a major operation tomorrow attacking voters trying to cast their ballots in the election

Syria has been ruled for the past 50 years by the Baath party, who are supporting al-Assad. Opponents to the current regime have been banned from running for election.

As a result, rebel forces have called on Syrians to boycott the poll.

Al-Assad's Information Minister Omran al-Zohbi said: 'The presidential election is a genuine occasion for all Syrians to express... their personal opinion, in a totally transparent way.'

Large posters featuring President Bashar al-Assad have been erected in areas loyal to the regime such as Damascus in advance of tomorrow's election

However, in areas such as Aleppo, the Syrian regime are launching airstrikes on opposition areas. Almost 2,000 people - a quarter of the population - have been killed in the heavy fighting

In one such airstrike, this building in Aleppo was destroyed by fighter-bombers earlier today

Assad faces two opponents for president, Maher al-Hajjar and Hassan al-Nuri, although neither is widely known in Syria. 

Opponents have branded the poll a 'blood election' as an estimated 162,000 people have been killed during the conflict.

One civil servant living in Damascus said he had no choice when it came to casting his ballot: 'I have to, because there is a voting station in the building where I work. I can't escape.'

Peaceful opposition to the al-Assad regime started in March 2011 with Arab Spring-inspired street protests. But following a brutal crackdown, the situation deteriorated into a full-scale civil war.

Thousands of foreign fighters have travelled to Syria to join the insurgency. Among those involved in the fighting are large numbers of hard-line jihadists. 

The election is being monitored by observers from North Korea, Brazil, Russia and Iran.

Rebels placed mirror in sections of their tunnels so they could monitor whether pro-regime forces were approaching

Rebel forces have used tunnels to place explosives under government-held strong points using methods first developed during the First World War on the Western Front

A pro-government newspaper has said that the regime has launched a major security operation in advance of tomorrow's poll
