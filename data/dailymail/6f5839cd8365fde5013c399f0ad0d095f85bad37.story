Australian Jay Pheonix has smashed the world record for the most bungee jumps in 24 hours - and almost his ankles in the process.

Mr Pheonix, began jumping in Queensland at 6am local time on Thursday, and completed 150 jumps in 21 hours.

If the record is confirmed by Guinness World Records, Mr Pheonix will have beaten Kevin Scott Huntly, from South Africa who managed 105 jumps in 24 hours in 2011.

Jay Pheonix breaks the Guinness World Record by completing 150 bungee jumps in 24 hours. Jay actually did his jumps in 21 hours, and ate his food while taking part in the challenge

Video footage captures Mr Pheonix in training for the challenge, and shows him ringing his mother before practice jumps.

But not even a mother's love could prepare Mr Pheonix for the ankle agony that he is now suffering as a result of the feat.

Mr Pheonix has complained that his ankles are sore after he completed 150 bungee jumps in 21 hours, that is 45 more than current record holder Kevin Scott

Speaking to Australia's ABC after the challenge, he said: "My ankles are destroyed,

"They are going to take a little bit to recover. I literally couldn't strap them on and jump again if I tried.'

Another video also shows the feat 
itself, and the reaction from onlookers to Mr Pheonix, who says that he 
ate food between jumps to keep going, and during some jumps was still 
chewing.

Mr 
Pheonix will now submit proof of his record to Guinness World Records 
for verification before getting his hands on the coveted certificate.

Justin Bieber gives bungee jumping a try at Auckland Bunjy, at Westhaven Marina in New Zealand

The
craze for dangling by your feet spread around the world, and it is thought that the eye-watering 
233 metres high Macau Tower is the current highest bungee site.

Many
celebrities have enjoyed the thrill of a bungee jumping experience.

Fresh-faced heart-throb Justin
Bieber took the plunge at Auckland Bridge Bunjy, at Westhaven 
Marina in New Zealand in 2010.

David Beckham has also got a head for heights, and in 2008 he also jumped from the Auckland Harbour Bridge.

And Stephen Fry chose bungee jumping as a way to get over his fear of heights.

Mr Fry, 54 swallowed his absolute terror when he leaped off the Kawaru Bridge and fell 43 metres by his feet towards the river below.

In the 1995 James Bond Film Goldeneye, the hero is shown jumping from a dam in Russia.
