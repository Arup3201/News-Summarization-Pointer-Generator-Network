A 20-year-old man badly hurt in an outback car crash has been rescued after crawling through the Australian desert for more than 30 hours, leaving SOS messages in the mud.

The injured man, who has yet to be identified, was a passenger in a car that crashed south west of the remote Queensland town of Winton on Sunday morning.

In an extraordinary coincidence, he began
his desperate search for help as British teenager Sam Woodhead was 
recovering from being lost for three days just 80 miles to the south.

For 33 hours the passenger made his painful way through the harsh landscape before he was found

Police said that the survivor and a 19-year-old man worked as jackaroos on the Brighton Downs Cattle Station and had driven into Winton to visit the local pub.

They remained in the small town, renowned for its rare dinosaur fossils, before setting out for the cattle ranch at 4m on Sunday, with the 19-year-old at the wheel.

Two hours later the car rolled over and the driver died at the scene.

It was then that the passenger set out on foot on a self-preservation mission.

With facial injuries, bruising and dehydration taking their toll, he stumbled and crawled through the desert scrub, scrawling SOS in the mud and an arrow pointing in the direction he was heading.

A search party had been launched yesterday and it was then that the wreckage of the car and the body of the teenager was found.

The man had made SOS signals (not pictured) and arrows to try and alert others to where he was

For 33 hours the passenger made his painful way through the harsh landscape before he was found by the crew of a private helicopter lying face down in a small pool of water some 10 miles from the crash site.

'He is extremely lucky to be alive,' said Sergeant Wayne Lynn of Winton police. 'From the time of the crash it was about 33 hours until the time he was located.

'But he was continually leaving SOS marks on the ground as he moved, with an arrow.

'Sometime in the afternoon of the second day he heard the chopper above him and saw the chopper pilot signal.

'He was laying in a shallow pool of water at the time.'

The man was taken to Winton Hospital, where he was today being treated for facial injuries and dehydration.
