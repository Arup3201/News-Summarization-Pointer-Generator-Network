The first female captain of a frontline Royal Navy warship has been removed from her post amid claims she had an affair with another shipmate.

It has been confirmed that Commander Sarah West has been 'removed from command' from the ship.

However, a spokesman added that she would remain in the service and would be re-appointed to another post.

The Royal Navy has confirmed that Commander Sarah West has been removed from command of HMS Portland amid claims of an affair

Divorced Commander West, 42, took charge of Type 23 frigate HMS Portland in May 2012.

However, she left the vessel last month following allegations that she had a relationship with newly-wed Lieutenant Commander Richard Gray, who married his wife Melissa in December.

Commander West recently described 
herself as ‘single’, having been married to former Royal Navy pilot 
Andrew Whitlum but the pair separated in 2006.

At the time the Royal Navy said it would conduct an inquiry into whether she breached the armed forces' code of conduct, which governs personal relationships within the military.

In a statement a spokesman said no details would be given of the inquiry or its outcome.

However, he added: 'We can confirm that Commander Sarah West, Commanding Officer of HMS Portland, has been removed from Command.

'This is an internal matter between the individual and her senior officers and we will not give further details of the removal.

'Commander West will continue to serve in the Royal Navy and she will be reappointed to a post where her skills and experience can be used to best effect.'

The spokesman added that Commander West's second-in-command has taken over the running of the ship, which returned to the UK on Saturday after a seven-month deployment in the Atlantic and Caribbean.

After her appointment two years ago Commander West described it as the greatest achievement of her career, but in an interview earlier this year she explained how work commitments made it difficult to have a relationship.

She told the Daily Mirror: 'I'm really proud to be the first woman but I'm not reinventing the wheel. Lots of women in the services have challenging roles. It's just that I happen to be newsworthy at the moment.

'There are drawbacks though. Years at sea probably explains why I'm single. But every person in the military makes sacrifices.'

Commander West, who was born and raised in Lincolnshire, studied maths at the University of Hertfordshire before joining Britannia Royal Naval College in September 1995.

She was selected as a small ship navigator and joined HMS Cottesmore in 1997 and subsequent appointments included Officer of the Watch of HMS Sheffield and Navigating Officer of HMS Somerset.

The ship recently returned to the UK following a seven month deployment in the Atlantic and Caribbean

In 2007 she joined the Permanent Joint Headquarters and was responsible for co-ordinating the UK contribution to operations in the Balkans, which included the period that saw Kosovo’s declaration of independence.

Selected for sea command in 2008, she commanded minesweepers HMS Ramsey, HMS Penzance, HMS Pembroke and HMS Shoreham between April 2009 and December 2011.

Her time on HMS Pembroke included eight and a half months deployed on operations in the Arabian Gulf.

She was promoted to commander in January 2012 and assumed command of HMS Portland in May that year.

Lieutenant Commander Gray is Portland’s operations officer, in charge of weapons and defence systems.
