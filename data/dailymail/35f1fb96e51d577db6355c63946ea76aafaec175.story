Profits at Moss Bros have tripled, thanks to the soaring popularity of school proms for teenagers marking the end of their exams.

The menswear hire chain made £3million in 12 months to the end of January, up from £900,000 in the preceding year.

Almost all schools now stage a formal end-of-year celebration, inspired by  American television shows like Glee and High School Musical.

Demand has also been boosted by the trend towards mixing smarter clothes with casualwear, sported by boy bands such as One Direction.

Moss Bros said its annual profits were ‘driven by strong demand for eveningwear and the emerging school proms market’. It has noticed a move away from ‘end-of-exam’ discos to formal dances.

The highest volume of proms orders are generated in Greater London and the North West.

The firm, established in 1851, said: ‘The proms market has continued to grow at a healthy pace over the past four to five years, influenced by American sitcoms and soaps like My Super Sweet 16 and Prom Queen. There are very few schools in Britain that now don’t have proms.’

It added: ‘Many of our younger customers are encouraged to visit due to the nostalgia recounted by their parents.’

Chief
executive Brian Brick said the growing numbers of younger customers 
have influenced the styles for this year, with suits in bold colours as 
well conventional black.

‘These are paired with Hawaiian prints, bright poplins and textural velvets,’ he added.

Mr Brick said his staff are specially trained to help teenagers buy or hire what is often their first suit.

‘We give them a bit more time and space than other chains are able to do,’ he said.

In the UK, proms are now being staged for 16-year-olds after the end of GCSEs as well as following A-levels for 18-year-olds.

This follows the American tradition, where they have become a major feature in  popular culture for high-school students.
