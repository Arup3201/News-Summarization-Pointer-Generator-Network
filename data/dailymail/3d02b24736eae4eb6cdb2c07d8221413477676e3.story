It’s amazing what difference a simple flick of eyeliner, hint of blusher or brush of lipstick does to a woman’s face.

And now artist TT Brett has shown how these little changes can transform a man’s face too - and not just any man!

Princes and heroes from beloved animated Disney films have been given the female touch in these fun photos.

On her Tumblr blog, Let There Be Doodles,
 the 23-year-old artist has altered the faces of Disney princes, such as
 Prince Charming from Cinderella and Prince Philip of Sleeping Beauty, 
to look like women.

Disney's Aladdin has been given a makeover to make him look like a woman, by 23-year-old artist TT Brett on her Tumblr blog. There are 9 illustrations in her 'Genderbent Disney' project

Entitled, Genderbent Disney, the series of illustrations shows Brett’s adaptations next to their original Disney form.

Altering Disney characters might not be a new trend, but merging the genders of iconic faces is seen as a statement about stereotypes and identity.

‘I wanted to create my own unique versions of Disney's characters,’ Brett told The Huffington Post.

'After editing, the end result created women with stronger features, and a wider variety of facial and body structures.

He's no prince, but John Smith from Disney's Pocahontas was given the 'Genderbending' makeover too, to look like a woman. Artist TT Brett slimmed out John's frame, lengthened his hair and softened his face to make it appear more feminine

'The men were slightly more effeminate, 
slimmer bodies, and almost always looked younger.

'Almost every image 
was, in a sense, the opposite of Disney ideals.'

The response to her illustrations as been, according to Brett, 'pretty unbelievable.'

She says how several fellow artists have shared their own edits since.

Brett was inspired by The Crowned Heart tumblr, which adapts, alters and edits a lot of animated images, including Disney.

‘The result of my edits, although still utilising many of the Disney stereotypes of gender to create the most drastic changes, maintain the character's focal features,’ she explained.

The nine male characters who have undergone the ‘Genderbending’ makeover are Prince Charming, Prince Philip, Aladdin, The Little Mermaid’s Prince Eric, the converted Beast in Beauty and the Beast, Hercules, John Smith from Pocahontas, Prince Naveen from The Princess and the Frog and Captain Phoebus from Esmeralda.
