Donald Sterling has shown his face at an upmarket steak restaurant just hours after insisting there was 'no basis ' to strip him of the LA Clippers after making racist remarks during a 'lovers' tiff'.

He waved to cameras as he was driven away from Mastros in Beverley Hills just hours after the NBA tried to oust him as part of the ongoing race row.

The 80-year-old businessmen, who bought the side in 1981, has said there is no basis to strip him of his team because his statements were illegally recorded 'during an inflamed lovers' quarrel in which he was clearly distraught.'

According to the response,
 a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press, Sterling says V. 
Stiviano recorded him without his knowledge and thus the recording was 
illegal under California law.

He also said he could not have 'willfully'
 damaged the league because he did not know it would be made public.

'A jealous rant to a lover never intended to be published cannot offend the NBA rules,' Sterling said in the document, which was first reported by USA Today.

Meanwhile, the attorney for Shelly Sterling said that Donald Sterling has given her written permission to sell the team.

Illegal? Sterling claims that his remarks were private and not meant to 'take a position' that damaged the NBA

According to a person who is in 
contact with a potential bidder, who spoke to the Associated Press 
anonymously, the Clippers are seeking binding bids before next 
Tuesday â€” the day NBA owners are scheduled to meet in New York and vote 
on whether to strip Sterling of the team.

Donald Sterling said in the response's cover letter he has already received 'offers in excess of $2.5billion for the purchase of the team.'

A bidder told the Los Angeles Times 'bids 
are due Thursday afternoon at 2pm. We will probably know who bought the 
team by Friday.'

The league 
said in a statement Tuesday that if three-quarters of the 30 owners 
voted to sustain the charge, 'the Sterlings' interests in the Clippers 
will be terminated and the team will be sold.'

The
 NBA charged Donald Sterling with damaging the league and its 
merchandising partners, and the league's constitution gave him until the
 end of Tuesday to respond.

According to a basketball official familiar 
with the proceedings, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was 
not authorized to discuss Sterling, the NBA has scheduled a call of its 
executive committee for 3 p.m. EDT on Wednesday.

Shelly Sterling submitted her own separate response to the NBA's charges Tuesday that included a 'vigorous defense of the attempt by the NBA to blame her for doing nothing wrong,' according to a person with knowledge of the proceedings. The individual wasn't authorized to speak publicly about the response.

In his response, Donald Sterling says that next week's hearing cannot be fair because the owners have already made up their minds, quoting 10 teams who commented on Twitter or elsewhere that they supported the seizure of the team. An AP survey on the day Commissioner Adam Silver announced Sterling's lifetime ban found that half of the teams supported it and no owner was against it.

'These proceedings will be a spectacle meant to mollify the popular opinion, not a fair and impartial hearing: the outcome of these proceedings became a foregone conclusion weeks ago,' the response states.

The response also notes the disparity 
between his lifetime ban and $2.5 million fine and previous NBA 
punishments, including the $100,000 fine levied on Kobe Bryant when he 
was caught referring to a referee as a homosexual slur, and the 72-game 
suspension of Ron Artest for punching a fan.

The NBA said Sterling is in violation because his racist comments were harmful to the league and its business partners, including the players.

Sterling's response argues that because his comments came in the privacy of his girlfriend's living room he cannot be considered 'taking a position' that damaged the NBA, as required under the league constitution.

'Mr. Sterling was not "conducting" the "sport of professional basketball" when he was arguing with Ms. Stiviano in her living room,' the response says. 'Not even the Commissioner alleges that Mr. Sterling intended to harm the NBA with his comment. Nor could he. This was an argument between a jealous man and the woman he loved that should never have left the privacy of his living room.'

Sterling's recent comments on African-Americans' helping one another and Magic Johnson to Anderson Cooper 'do not violate the NBA Constitution,' the response says.

The response also says that Sterling is 
locked out of his office at the Staples Center and is unable to respond to 
allegations that his behavior has 'a material adverse impact on the 
NBA.'

Sterling also noted his history of supporting racial diversity, including five black head coaches and a black general manager, Elgin Baylor, who held the job for 22 years. Baylor eventually unsuccessfully sued Sterling, accusing him of racist behavior. It also notes that he was due to receive his second lifetime achievement award from the NAACP before the recording of his comments was leaked.

The response claims that it would cost Sterling $300 million to $500 million in capital gains taxes if he is forced to sell now rather than pass the team to his heirs.
