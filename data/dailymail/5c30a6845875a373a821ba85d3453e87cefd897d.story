Prince Albert of Monaco and his sisters have branded a new Hollywood film about the life of their mother Grace Kelly as 'pointlessly glamorised and historically inaccurate'.

The ruling family of the tiny Mediterranean tax haven also attacked some scenes in the forthcoming movie starring Nicole Kidman as 'pure fiction'.

American-born Kelly was one of the world's most famous film stars until she married Albert's father in 1956 and became Princess Grace of Monaco.

The High Society and Dial M for Murder actress died in a car accident on a winding road above the principality in 1982 at the age of 52.

Oscar-winner Kidman is now starring as Kelly in the biopic called Grace of Monaco - due for release next year - that centres on her life in 1962 as a young princess in Monaco.

The film also stars British actors Robert Lindsay as Greek shipping billionaire Aristotle Onassis, and Derek Jacobi as Count Fernando D'Aillieres.

US star Tim Roth plays Grace's husband Prince Rainier III of Monaco in the film directed by Frenchman Olivier Dahan.

Prince
Albert is said to have been sent scripts before filming began in Monaco
and the south of France last autumn in a bid to win his support for the
movie, French daily le Figaro reported.

But
Albert and his sisters Princess Caroline and Princess Stephanie have 
now issued a statement saying they had 'no part' in the making the 
making of the film.

They wrote: 'We have had absolutely no association with this project which is claims to be about the lives of our parents.

'For us, this film does not constitute a biographical work, but portrays only a part of her life and has been pointlessly glamored, and contains important historical inaccuracies as well as scenes of pure fiction.'

Kidman said recently of the movie: 'What really interested me about this film is how it covers Grace's transition from film star to Princess in 1962.

'It reveals her great humanity but also her fears and frailties as she leaves her career behind.'

The memory of Grace Kelly is still revered in Monaco, with streets, a hospital and other public buildings all named after her.

Mystery still surrounds Grace's death, in which the official version of events states that the Princess suffered a stroke while driving with daughter Stephanie in the passenger seat.

She suffered serious head injuries and died in hospital the next day.

But three decades later, there are still persistent rumours that 17-year-old Stephanie, who suffered only minor bruising in the crash, had actually been driving at the time.
