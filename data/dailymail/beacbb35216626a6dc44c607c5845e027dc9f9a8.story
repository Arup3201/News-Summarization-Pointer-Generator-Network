A former champion boxer who crashed a high-powered sports car into a bus stop causing a man to lose his leg has been jailed.

Lugman Nazir, 22, crashed his Subaru Impreza during a 100mph chase, hitting Isaak Thompson, 20, who was sat on a wall in Bradford, last year.

After the crash, the town's crown court was told Nazir climbed out of the wreckage and stepped over Mr Thompson who was so badly injured he may have to have his other leg amputated.

He fled the scene without checking whether Mr Thompson was even alive.

Mr Thompson is currently receiving counselling for post-traumatic stress disorder and coming to terms with the possibility of losing his other leg.

Nazir, who was a Leeds City champion boxer when he was a teenager, was arrested a few hours after the accident at his home in Bradford.

He had a history of offences and was on bail at the time of the collision for a violent bag snatch the previous month.

The court heard that just eight days before the crash, he had been seen speeding at 80mph in Bradford in the Subaru Impreza but the police could not catch him.

The court was also told how he pulled a woman by the hair and stole her friend's Peugeot car.

In 2010, he was locked up for 21 months for punching a man in the face during a drunken row.

Nazir pleaded guilty to robbery, careless driving, having no insurance, dangerous driving, causing Mr Thompson grievous bodily harm, common assault and theft.

Judge Colin Burn, who watched the aftermath of the crash on CCTV, told Nazir: 'All that can be seen on impact is a scene of broken glass and various debris strewn across the road but we know that Mr Thompson lost his leg.

'Many of the things that you would aspire to do yourself, he will not be able to do for the rest of his life simply as a result of your driving at ridiculous speeds, losing control of your vehicle and crashing it in that way.'

Judge Burn jailed Nazir for five-and-a-half years and also banned him from driving for three years.

Ian Howard, mitigating, said the injuries he caused Mr Thompson, whose university plans have been put on hold, might motivate him stop a life of crime.
