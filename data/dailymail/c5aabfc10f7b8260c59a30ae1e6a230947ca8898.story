Themes such as fairies, goblins and Edward Scissorhands have helped one rather talon-ted woman win more than a 100 prizes for her nail creations. 

Kirsty Meakin, 35, from Stoke-on-Trent, started training as a beautician when she was just 17 and has now travelled around the world to take home trophies for her nail art. 

Each creation takes between 30 and 100 hours and costs up to £400 in materials.

Kirsty's first competition entry was a set of Moulin Rouge themed nails at a competition in Manchester.

Now she has won over 100 trophies for her nail art and has travelled as far afield as Las Vegas and Los Angeles.

The beautician's work has even been displayed at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

The King of Pop: Kirsty Meakin has even created nail art dedicated to Michael Jackson, which takes between 30 and 100 hours to do

Kirsty says: 'I only went to beauty school because my mother said if I didn't do something with my life she'd kick me out.

'When I started, nail art wasn't even a thing, but after a few years it came onto the scene and I started experimenting with different mediums.

'In 2004 I entered my first competition and won and things just spiralled from there.'

She has worked on London Fashion Week and even done nails for celebrities such as Natasha Hamilton and Eliza Doolittle.

Kirsty adds: 'My favourite piece is the Day of the Dead nails.

'They took so long to complete and my poor model was stood in a really uncomfortable position because her thumbs had to be together.

Fairy tale nails: 

'People kept coming up and asking for photos so she had to wear the nails for four hours.

'I try to make them as light as possible by hollowing out the 3D structures but they still weigh about two pounds.'

As well as the fantasy nails, Kirsty also produces boxed nail art for display.

She explains: 'The boxed nail art still takes me over 100 hours to complete. I'd always excelled at art at school so this was just a different medium to use.

'By the time I have bought all the pieces they can cost up to £400 to create.'

And now Kirsty has retired from competitions and turned her hand to teaching others her tricks of the trade.

She has also launched her own range of products, including the first gel varnish not to require a top or base coat.

Kirsty says: 'I wanted my products to be something different.

'All the nail products you see in shops are made in three factories, just with different labels on.

'I wanted to be able to tweak the product to get something I was really happy to put my name on.

'Now I want to put together a book of all my nail art, I'm just looking for a publisher.'
