Spring officially sprang just a couple of days ago.

But don’t be surprised if it feels as if you’ve already skipped a whole season and hurtled straight into summer.

Parts of Britain are today expected to post hotter temperatures than Bermuda.

Comfy? A couple perch on what is expected to be confirmed as the world's
 largest deckchair on Bournemouth Beach yesterday as the mercury rose to a 
balmy 18.7C

The mother of all deckchairs: A woman walks past the sculpture on 
Bournemouth beach yesterday, which at 8.5m tall by 5.5m wide is 
taller than a double decker bus

Easy does it: Engineers use a 35-tonne crane and cherry picker to get 
the deckchair in place on the sand at Bournemouth beach yesterday

Some places could bask in a toasty 21c (70f), with the warm weather likely to continue over the weekend and into next week.

However, sun-lovers should spare a thought for gardeners as the warm, dry spell boosts fears of a prolonged drought.

Even though yesterday was the warmest 
day of the year so far – at 20.1c in Otterbourne, Hampshire – 
forecasters expect things to warm up further today. A Met Office 
spokesman said: ‘It is very warm for March.

Good start: A jogger runs as the sun rises over Tynemouth beach, Tyne 
and Wear today. Temperatures are expected to get up to 20C today and 
could rise to 21C today

Tripping the lighthouse fantastic: The sun rises over the lighthouse on Tynemouth Pier, Tyne and Wear, yesterday

‘We’re usually looking at a maximum temperature of 11c or 12c at this time of year.

‘We expect Friday may be the hottest day of the year so far with the Thames Valley and Bristol hitting 20c or even 21c.

‘The dry weather should stay over the weekend with lots of sunny spells.

Nick Prebble, a meteorologist at 
MeteoGroup, said: ‘This is unseasonably mild. Generally speaking, 9c or 
10c should be the average maximum temperature for this time of year.

Spring has sprung:  A man in a yellow jacket sets off the blooming 
daffodils in Belfast Victoria park, in the shadow of the shipyard yesterday

Roots of recovery? Daffodils blossom in front of the Bank of England in central London, today in spite of the Chancellor's gloomy budget yesterday

'We should enjoy it now while we can. Sunday looks like it will be even sunnier.

‘Temperatures in London should be 19c or 20c but the warmth will be more widespread across the country than Saturday.’

Although the figures fall several 
degrees short of the record March temperature of 25.6c (78f) at Mepal in
 Cambridgeshire on March 29, 1968, they are on a par with what we can 
usually expect in mid to late June.

But it will not feel quite as balmy 
because the sun is lower in the sky, so its radiation is weaker and will
 not feel as warm on the skin.

It will also be colder earlier and 
later in the day than in June, with the peak temperatures lasting for a 
comparatively brief period.

The warm weather comes after the UK had its driest February for 14 years.

The Environment Agency has warned that
 in drought-affected areas, aquatic insects such as dragonflies will be 
killed off as streams, ponds and shallow lakes dry up.

In its latest briefing on the drought 
situation, the Environment Agency said the past week had been the driest
 for England and Wales for around six months.

But Dan Williams, from the Met Office,
 said: ‘Moving into April, it looks like we will see more average 
conditions for this time of year, and rainfall will be closer to 
average.’

The unseasonable warmth is likely to boost what has become almost a national pastime – talking about the weather.

A new study shows Britons spend at least three months of their life discussing it.

Researchers found 72 per cent of us 
talk about it at least once a day for an average six and a half minutes.

Spread out over a lifetime, women spend 106 days of their life chatting
 about it, while men use up 92 days.

A survey of 3,000 adults for the 
Pimm’s Great British Summer Report says 43 per cent of us believe our 
love of talking about the weather is a peculiarly British trait.

TV comedian Mel Giedroyc said: ‘We 
talk about the weather because there’s so much of it. What other nation 
can boast four seasons in one day?'

Not there yet: It wasn't quite warm enough for swimsuits for these girls
 in Manchester City centre yesterday, but today's soaring temperatures 
could change all that
