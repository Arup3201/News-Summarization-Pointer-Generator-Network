Eating white dirt is an ancient southern tradition that continues to be carried out to this day, mainly by women who crave the chalky white substance.

The extraordinary phenomenon, known as geophagy, is the subject of a new documentary film, Eat White Dirt, which explores the curious culture of earth-eating that continues to thrive in parts of the South.

The particular rock in question is called kaolin and can be found along the Atlantic Coast Fall Line that runs through southern states including Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama.

Tammy Wright consumes around a pound of kaolin every day and claims it has helped her lose over 60lbs since she began eating it

Though the practice is rarely if ever recommended by medical professionals, some nutritionists admit the habit of eating clay may help absorb toxins

It is used medically to treat 
diarrhea, dysentary, cholera, and is also used in paper making, paint, 
fiberglass, porcelains and ceramics, china, and toothpaste.

Though the practice is rarely if ever recommended by medical professionals, some nutritionists admit the habit of eating clay may have some real health benefits.

‘It is possible that the binding effect of clay would cause it to absorb toxins,’ Dr. David Katz, a nutrition expert at the Yale School of Medicine, told ABC News in 2005.

Director Adam Forrester said he became intrigued by the tradition after he started to notice ‘mysterious little bags of white, chalky rocks’ for sale in many of the locally-owned convenience stores where he lived in Columbus, Georgia.

Director Adam Forrester decided to explore the topic of white dirt after he found plastic bags of the stuff for  sale in convenience stores in Columbus, Georgia

‘These Zip-loc bags, labeled “White Dirt” were most often for sale right at the front of the store, next to the register,’ he told Feature Shoot.

‘I’d never seen anything like that before. I would ask the clerks, “What is this white clay for?” They would reply, “Oh I don’t know, people eat it.”’

In Eat White Dirt, due to be released in the summer, Forrester examines the prehistoric origins of eating dirt, its medical mythology and the abiding relationship that people in the South continue to have with the peculiar mineral.

Geophagy has been practiced by many different cultures from the ancient Greeks to Native Americans for centuries.

In most places the habit is limited to women, especially women who are pregnant or of childbearing age. 

Tierra Griffin confessed that she stops by her local convenient store in Greensboro, Georgia, two to three times per week to purchase a bag or two

The practice is common in sub-Saharan Africa, and many anthropologists believe it was brought to the United States by African slaves.

It is now most commonly found among African-American women in the rural South.

Forrester interviewed several women who admitted to craving the taste of white dirt, which is typically described as ‘fresh, natural-feeling, like the rain or something’.

'I eat white dirt every day,' said Tammy Wright, who admitted to consuming about a pound of kaolin every day and claims it has helped her lose over 60lbs.

' I just had a craving for white dirt and I just started eating it and eating it and I've never stopped,' said Tierra Griffin, another kaolin lover.

According to Forrester, one of the greatest misconception about those who eat white dirt are extremely poor.

‘Most often this practice is erroneously associated with poverty. Dirt itself is considered the lowest of the low.

'We literally walk all over it daily. Many people assume that anyone that would be willing to put dirt - in all of its dirtiness - in their mouth must be incredibly hungry, and have no other option.

'This just simply isn’t true. I’ve met so many wonderful people who are practitioners of geophagy, or earth-eating, and most of them are living comfortable middle class lives. I’ve even met several Doctors of Philosophy that choose to eat white dirt as well,' he said.

Some of other names that white dirt is known as are clay dirt, white clay, porcelain clay, china clay, chalk, or the scientific name of aluminum silicate hydroxide.
