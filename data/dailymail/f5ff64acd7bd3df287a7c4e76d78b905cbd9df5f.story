A young woman whose headaches were dismissed as migraines died just hours after being diagnosed with a brain tumour.

Claire Gardiner, 30, only discovered how ill she was after she was admitted to hospital due to severe vomiting. She had been told by doctors she was suffering from migraines.

Miss Gardiner, from Heighington, County
 Durham, was taken to Darlington Memorial
 Hospital after the vomiting left her unable to eat 
or drink for more than a week.

Claire Gardiner died just hours after finding out she had a brain tumour, despite doctors reassuring her she simply had migraines

She was given fluids and discharged but during the night woke her brother, Matthew, 25, after losing sight in her left eye.

She was rushed back into hospital and transferred to The James Cook University Hospital, in Middlesbrough, where doctors found the tumour.

The brain tumour had grown and put pressure on Claire's brain, leaving her suddenly blind in one eye.

Doctors tried to reduce the swelling, but the tumour acted aggressively to the medication and nothing could be done to help her.

She died hours later on December 20 last year.

Her brother said: 'The tumour was 10cm by 10cm and causing huge pressure on her brain.

'They tried to reduce the swelling but it had acted aggressively to the medication and they couldn't help her.'

Her family have since paid to her, and how she continued to help others after her death by donating her organs.

Three people in their twenties and a man in his sixties are are now recovering from operations after receiving her organs.

Miss Gardiner's family has now urged others to become organ donors and help save lives.

Her brother, Eddie, said his sister was extremely charitable and would always try to help those less fortunate. 'Claire registered as an organ donor when she was 17. Even after her death she wanted to help people.

'She was a loving caring person who would help anyone and in any way that she could.

'She wouldn't pass anyone in need if she could help and she would always give money to all of the Big Issue sellers she passed while out shopping.

'At Christmas time she would send Christmas cards to Salvation Army to give out to people who wouldn't have received anything, and tried to spread some cheer to those in need.

'For her 30th birthday she even paid for us all to go to her favourite city, Rome, to celebrate.'

Miss Gardiner worked in the NHS supply chain with DHL, and was previously employed as a solicitor with Clarke Willis as an immigration case worker.

Outside work, her brother said she had a real passion for motorcycling. 'She loved her jobs, and like all girls she loved spending money on handbags and shoes.

'But she wasn't a girly girl, she also loved her Honda motorbike and would regularly come out riding with me and Matthew and would not be outdone by the boys.

'Anything we did, she would have a go at too, even when our mum, Donella, tried to bribe her with a BMW convertible car to stop her getting a bike licence.

'We spent a lot of time together and were really close, and everyone knew how kind and caring Claire was.'

A Just Giving fund, set up in Miss Gardiner's memory by her family, has raised more than Â£1,500 for the Salvation Army.

Anthony Kennedy, a specialist nurse at NHS Blood and Transplant Organ Donation, said: 'Our condolences go out to Claire's family.

'Losing someone you love is never easy and deciding to donate their organs can be difficult.

'By signing up to the NHS Organ Donor Register Claire made her wishes known so her family were able to make the decision with the knowledge that they had respected these wishes.

'With around 10,000 people needing an organ transplant in the UK and three people dying every day, it's vital that people show their support for organ donation by signing up to the NHS Organ Donor Register and telling their families.'
