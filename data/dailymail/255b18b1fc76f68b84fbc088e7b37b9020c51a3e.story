A 25-year-old woman from London was today arrested on suspicion of Syria-related terror offences.

She was detained at Luton Airport in Bedfordshire by detectives from the West Midlands counter-terrorism unit as she left a flight that had returned to the UK from Istanbul.

The woman from Haringey, north London, was arrested as part of a continuing intelligence-led policing operation.

She was being held this afternoon at a police station in the West Midlands on suspicion of preparing for acts of terrorism.

The terror threat level in the UK was raised from substantial to severe earlier this year against a backdrop of increasing concerns over hundreds of aspiring British jihadis travelling to Iraq and Syria to learn terrorist ‘tradecraft’.

Fears of a terrorist attack on Britain's streets have heightened in the wake of Islamic State's rise.

The extremist group, also known as ISIS, has taken over large swathes of Iraq and Syria and attracted thousands of foreign jihadists to its cause, including more than 500 Britons.

A new Counter-terrorism and Security Bill, containing a range of draconian powers including new orders that can block suspected British fighters from returning to the UK, was introduced to Parliament this year.

Separately today, it was reported that the number of arrests in terrorism investigations in Britain had jumped by 40 per cent this year.

Police had arrested 312 people for various terrorist offences as of December 16, 2014, compared with 222 offences in 2013, according to data from the Metropolitan Police and Home Office.

In addition, detectives in London said they had been contacted by 39 families this year with concerns that a relative may be planning to travel to fight in Syria, reported Bloomberg.

Last month a man aged 20 and a woman, 19, from Walsall were detained at London Heathrow Airport on suspicion of Syria-related terrorism offences as they disembarked a flight from Istanbul.

Also last month, a 19-year-old man from Coventry was held by counter-terrorism officers at the same airport after arriving on a flight from Jordan.

But earlier this year, London Mayor Boris Johnson was roundly criticised after calling for British citizens travelling to Iraq and Syria to be stripped of their passports automatically.
