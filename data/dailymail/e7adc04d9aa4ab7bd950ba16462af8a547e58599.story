There I was, minding my own business, waiting for one of my children to mooch their way through the school gate when I noticed I had some very smart company: another mother who didn’t normally give little me the time of day.

In our little playground hive, she was undoubtedly the Queen Bee. To what could I possibly owe the pleasure? We were chatting away like old mates. Get me, I thought: I must be in with the in-crowd at last.

Then, as our offspring finally appeared, she leaned in and asked, in the sweetest possible way: ‘Stating the obvious, but have you taken your child to see a doctor? Just to check there’s nothing actually properly seriously wrong with them . . .’

You've been stung: The Queen Bee may appear to be nice to you then hit you with an insult

Zing! Ouch! Of course. She had come over to sting me. And she had judged it expertly: the perfect blend of kind, considerate, caring, mother-to-mother concern that can, on a bad day, reduce you to a gibbering, paranoid wreck.

My four children, now aged from 22 down to 12, went to various primary schools around the Home Counties.

But talking to friends further afield, I found that they could also match my experience, sting for sting.

In Kent, a friend met a mother who had improved her obnoxious child’s behaviour with a nutritional programme and generously offered to share it: ‘You never know, it might just help with your boy . . .’

Near Leeds, a friend was with her lovely gaggle of children and was stopped by a school-gate mum: ‘Aren’t they just adorable? I’m so intrigued by the unusual size of their heads.’

It doesn’t matter where you are. Go to any playground of any primary school - rural or urban, wealthy or not - and it’s the same story. Every community has its Queen Bee. She’s probably good-looking. She’s certainly confident. Hers is always the life that shimmers: domestic perfection bathed in a honeyed glow.

Everyone, including you, wants to get on with her, even to be her friend. When she’s nice to you, she makes you feel all warm and fuzzy.

High standards: Carole Middleton got under the skin of another mother when Kate and Pippa were at school because they always seemed so perfect

But, just occasionally, often when your guard is down or you’re feeling pretty chipper, she will come out with something toxic.

And that’s it. You drag your feet all the way back home. Your little bubble has been burst. You haven’t felt this rubbish since . . .

Exactly. There comes a moment early on in every half-sentient parent’s life, at a school gathering - the first PTA meeting, cake sale or quiz, oh yes, especially the quiz - when you are assaulted by the blinding flash of a profound, even existential, truth.

'The Queen Bee of the school gate can mutate into the strongest, most terrifying and most magnificent of her species'

Hang on a minute. This feels just like being back at school.

These aren’t fellow grown-ups: they are familiar stereotypes that last time you clocked them had ink on their fingers and Clearasil on their spots.

And you and all these other mothers will be appearing together in a torrid social melodrama that is to be played out, week in, week out, over the next seven years.

Groups will form and groups will fall apart: the cool ones, the keen ones, the sporty ones, the naughty ones. Even the ones who despise all social groups will find each other and start to hang out.

Friends will be made, some may be lost. But all the while, Queen Bees will reign over us all.

This is not a pattern unique to girls at school or the mothers who take them there. It is how female society tends to function.

Marlborough College: These school gates still haunt a mother who used to compare herself to the impressive Mrs Middleton

You will see the same thing, on a smaller scale, in book groups, NCT classes or female-dominated offices. Every ring will have its leader: there will always be the stinger and there will always be the stung.

I remember discussing a career break with a fellow professional. ‘It’s so much easier for someone like you to decide,’ she sighed. ‘But I earn six figures.’ Zing!

Any group of women together for a regular amount of time will somehow, instinctively, elect itself a leader. And there’s perhaps no stronger example of this than at the school gate.

Millions of us swarm there twice a day, five times a week, for years. And we’re not just looking after ourselves - we are looking out for our children.

That is why, as many of us know to our cost, the Queen Bee of the school gate can mutate into the strongest, most terrifying and most magnificent of her species.

And that is why sometimes she can get so out of control, she just has to come a cropper.

In my new novel, The Hive, I explore exactly this: the transfer of power from one Queen Bee to another. It does happen.

Years of slavish devotion from an adoring clique and absolute power as the head of a parents’ association can turn even the nicest of heads and suddenly you find you have created a monster.

She organises all the exercise classes - why shouldn’t she be the one to point out someone’s gained a couple of extra pounds?

She’s found a tennis teacher for the children - but we can’t really open lessons to just anyone . . .

And, of course, there wouldn’t even be a girls’ night out if it wasn’t for her - surely she was allowed to exclude just a couple of, um, you know, dull people?

And she’ll hand out the invitations for the sixth birthday party round here, too, just so everyone knows where they stand.

Winning mentality: The Queen Bee will always come out on top - until other women can join up to drive her out of the hive

Power corrupts, after all. And a Queen Bee can only use so many stings before she finds she’s  suddenly being driven out of her hive and the women who surround her are looking around for someone else to adore.

Of course, a lot of Queen Bees are pretty amazing: saintly, charismatic heroines who do wonders for the community. Even the annoying ones who drive us demented are pretty useful, too.

Look at your children’s school and ask yourself: would that library, playground, fete or just that lovely present for the teacher exist if it was up to the rest of us?

Not a chance. We’d never get our acts together. That is partly why we have developed that instinct to elevate Queen Bees into a position of power in the first place. They bother so we don’t have to.

And there is also a very good case to be made for the hive. Why do women group together in these gangs and cliques in the first place? Because we are determined to bond.

'The school days of our children are not 
only vivid while we live through them, they also somehow mark themselves
indelibly upon our minds'

Give us ten minutes waiting outside Brownies or swimming lessons and we will learn not just the names and ages of the other woman’s children, but also which one has eczema (poor love) and who’s top of the class (oh yes, she had to get that in).

While we can never be quite sure what children are really getting out of their primary schooldays, we do know their parents are making friends - and enemies - for life.

It may sound depressing, but it’s true: when you hit your 50s, you might not be able to remember what the milk’s doing in the bread bin or why you just went upstairs, but you do still have total recall of all those families with whom you connected over your children’s formative years.

The school days of our children are not only vivid while we live through them, they also somehow mark themselves indelibly upon our minds.

Just the other day, someone whose children were contemporaries of the Middletons finally broke her silence on her own deep psychological wounds.

The girls’ name tapes so neatly sown in; their manners so perfect . . . Carole’s impressively high standards of parenting had obviously been driving this woman nuts for years. The whole family had got under her skin.

And that was before one of them managed to bagsie a Royal. (Let’s just pause for a moment to imagine how that news must have gone down.)

Honestly. What sort of a weirdo must you be to not only notice the technique of name-tape application, but to remember it 15 years later?  Well - ahem! - quite an average sort of weirdo, really.

Recently, at the dentist, I fell out of the chair into a woman who went to school with me.

‘I was so hoping to see you at X’s the other day, at that great big reunion,’ she said.

Humph! Even if I had been invited I probably wouldn’t have gone. Whatever. Yet - zing! zap! - she’d got me again anyway: still stinging after all these years. The hive’s with you for ever . . . whether you like it or not.
