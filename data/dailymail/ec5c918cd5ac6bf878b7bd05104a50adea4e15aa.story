The Indian government is to dig up a ruined palace after a Hindu seer dreamt that tonnes of gold were buried underneath.

The Archaeological Survey of India is now sending a team of archaeologists to the village of Daundia Khera in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.

They are due to start digging on Friday said Praveen Kumar Mishra, the head archaeologist in the state.

Golden opportunity: The search for treasure has begun near this temple in Daundia Khera village

Yogi Swami Shobhan Sarkar says the gold he dreamt of belonged to a nineteenth-century ruler, Rao Ram Bux Singh.

He says he wants it in government hands to help India recover from an economic crisis.

'I
 cried the day I realised that India is going to collapse economically,'
 the seer told the Mail Today newspaper.

The dead ruler's spirit has 
been roaming the palace and asking for the gold to be dug up, he added.

'It is a hidden treasure for the country.'

Not all Hindu leaders are so keen to 
put bullion into the Reserve Bank of India's vaults.

Temples sitting on 
about half as much gold as in Fort Knox are resisting efforts by the 
central bank to audit their holdings.

Indians
 buy as much as 2.3 tonnes of gold, on average, every day - the weight 
of a small elephant - and what they don't give to the gods is mostly 
hoarded.

Investigate: The archaeologists plan to dig two 100-square-metre blocks beside the palace

That is costing the economy dear, since India has few gold mines.

Gold imports totalled $54 billion in the year ending on March 31, 2013, a major factor in swelling the current account deficit and undermining the rupee.

Swami Sarkar's dream haul of 1,000 tonnes would be enough to replace all of India's imports for a year and would be worth at least $40 billion.

The archaeologists plan to dig two 100-square-metre blocks beside the palace.

Mishra, however, warned that there was as yet no proof that any treasure lay beneath the soil of Daundia Khera village.

'We are still searching for the exact location and whether there is any treasure. It is all in the future,' he said.

'We often just find pottery and metal antiquities, like agricultural tools or kitchen tools.'
