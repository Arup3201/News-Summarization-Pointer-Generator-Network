A mother-of-two who is accused of murdering her husband has said she would rather die than face serving 30 years in a Dominican prison if she is convicted.

Nicola Reyes, 37, has described the horrific condition in which she has been kept for 14 months, allegedly without charge.

Even her own lawyer in the Caribbean fears she will be convicted, and her parents Micheal and Jeanette Clements claim the British Embassy and Foreign Office have failed to provide assistance.

Nicola Reyes ran over and killed her husband as he drove his motorbike alongside her SUV after a night out

They have now started a petition asking for Prime Minister David Cameron to intervene.

Speaking to the Sunday Mirror, Nicola, a former holiday rep from Cardiff said: 'If I am convicted - and I truly think I will be - I will get 30 years. I will kill myself. I have worked out a way to do it.'

In one incident inside the prison dubbed Devil's Hotel she says she listened as guards beat a man to death in the cell next to hers, then watched in horror as they dragged his body out and left it in full view of the other inmates until morning.

She said: 'I saw other male prisoners chained up so high by their hands they were forced to stand on tip-toe.

'Guards would beat them with sticks until the sticks broke.'

Even though she was moved to a private prison after six weeks her health has suffered due to the appalling conditions and she complains of intestine and bladder infections which mean she cannot eat the porridge served each morning.

She also worries she might have cancer after two smear tests carried out by the prison doctor showed something was wrong.

She said: 'I share a cell with two other girls. I have the top bunk and water drips on to my bed when it rains.

'There's a bucket behind a screened off curtain for a toilet and rats the size of cats in the corridors.

'In the mornings I cry in the shower - it is the only privacy I get.'

Jorge's family initially demanded £360,000 blood money but dropped the amount to £40,000 'compensation', a deal which the district attorney refused so Nicola remains in jail

Her time in the Devil's Hotel haunts Nicola. She received death threats and feared she would be killed after Jorge's brother said he would offer male inmates money to do it.

One night the power went out. Huddling together in the dark with the 15 other prisoners sharing her 12ft by 12ft cell, they told her that means either a breakout is happening, or a contract killing is being carried out.

In an ironic twist Nicola used to point out the prison on her tours while working for Thomas Cook, telling holidaymakers to avoid renting a car because the police would arrest you for merely witnessing an accident.

Nicola spent several hours in prison once before when she called the emergency services after she saw a drunk man knocked down.

Her parents, who moved back to Cardiff last April with her two children, Leah and Luke, have spent more than £100,000 on the case.

Nicola's mother, Jeanette, says she has emptied her pension and savings of more than £100,000 to pay for legal costs and accommodation

Nicola's mother and brother, Dean, even flew out to 
see her in July after they heard she was due to appear in court, but the
hearing was postponed after she arrived.

Her lawyer, Eduardo Trueba, has been trying to have the case moved to another town over fears she will not get a fair trial.

He also blames the British Embassy for not helping, saying the case could have been moved with ease if they had cooperated.

A spokesman for the Foreign Office said they were aware of the arrest and had been providing consular assistance.

'Live Life To the Best' - how an argument over a T-shirt meant whirlwind romance ended in tragedy

When Nicola first visited the stunning Caribbean isle of the Dominican Republic in 2000 she fell instantly in love with the country's white sands, palm trees and glorious sunshine.

She loved it so much that just three years later she moved there along with her two children, Leah and Luke, and her parents Jeanette and Micheal.

Jorge used to visit the family to help them out with their garden and pool. After a whirlwind romance Nicola married him in 2007 and the couple made a home for themselves in Puerto Plata.

But one night last July that was all due to change as the couple argued over money while out with friends.

Struggling to get by, Nicola became angry with Jorge when she spotted him wearing a T-shirt she didn't recognise with 'Live Life To the Best' written on the front.

She accused him of spending money on extras that they couldn't afford and a 'minor argument' happened.

Afterwards the couple drove home, Nicola in her jeep and Jorge riding beside her on his motorbike without wearing a helmet, the norm in the Dominican Republic.

After swerving to avoid a group of people Nicola says she heard a 'horrible bang' and jumped out to search of Jorge in the dark.

Police arrived at the scene, threw Jorge's body into the back of a van and told Nicola they were taking her to hospital, but actually to her to jail.

Once there she was told Jorge's family were accusing her of murder and demanded £360,000 in blood money.

Four months ago, after Nicola said she couldn't pay, Jorge's parents dropped the amount to £40,000 'compensation' but the district attorney refused the deal.

Having already spent 14 months behind bars she could now face a wait of up to two years before the case even reaches trial, and a potential 30 year sentence if convicted.
