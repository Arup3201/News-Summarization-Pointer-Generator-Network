The chairman of the BBC Trust has been forced into a humiliating climbdown over his repeated refusal to appear before a committee of MPs.

Lord Patten has spent months trying to avoid a grilling by members of the Commons European Scrutiny Committee over claims of bias in the BBC’s coverage of the EU.

But yesterday, Bill Cash, chairman of the committee that reviews UK-EU relations, announced that Lord Patten had given in.

The peer, a former European Commissioner, had three times refused the request, claiming it would be ‘inappropriate’ because it might interfere with the BBC’s ‘editorial independence’.

With European elections two months away and questions about the BBC’s perceived pro-EU bias high on the agenda, it is thought the session could take place within weeks.

Mr Cash said: ‘Chris Patten has accepted that he must take up our invitation. He went to considerable lengths to avoid appearing, which was quite extraordinary. We will not be treated in this manner.’

Lord Patten is paid £110,000-a-year to work part-time at the BBC Trust. His duties require him to represent the interests of licence fee payers.

He sparked fury last year by turning down three requests to give evidence to the committee. This led to suggestions that he was cynically exploiting a loophole that allows members of the Lords to veto appearances before Commons Select Committees.

Another committee member, Labour MP Kelvin Hopkins, said: ‘The reason Chris Patten was able to refuse us was because he is a member of the Lords.

'Peers can’t be commanded to appear in front of MPs. Had he just been Mr Patten we could have commanded him to appear but he felt as he was in the Lords he was able to refuse.’

It is understood Lord Patten’s stonewalling raised concerns among the chairmen of other Select Committees and is likely to lead to a change in parliamentary rules.

The BBC Trust said: ‘The Chairman made clear that while he was willing to appear before the Committee, the BBC’s constitutional independence under its Charter must be protected and he will not be in a position to discuss BBC editorial decisions.’
