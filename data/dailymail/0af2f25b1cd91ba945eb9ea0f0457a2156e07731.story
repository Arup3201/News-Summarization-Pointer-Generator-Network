A father-of-two accidentally killed himself with an overdose of painkilling medication after he used his mother’s morphine patch to treat his bad back.

Geoffrey Bates, 38, a garage sales manager, was found dead in bed by the mother of his two children just hours after combining the patch with other painkillers which had been prescribed by a hospital.

Mr Bates had earlier persuaded his 61-year-old mother to give him one of her fentanyl morphine patches which she had been using to treat her arthritis.

She warned her son it might be too strong for him but relunctantly agreed to hand a box of three over on condition he used them sparingly because he said he was in agony.

Tests showed Mr Bates, who worked for a Land Rover dealership in Bradford, West Yorkshire, died from a cardiac respiratory failure.

An inquest was told the tragedy took place last February after Singapore-born Mr Bates of Apperley Bridge, Bradford, had a severe recurrence of the back pain which had plagued him for two years.

A strong opioid medicine similar to morphine, fentanyl is used for treating chronic pain.

It is from the same basic  family as heroin and induces relaxation and euphoria.

Skin patches containing fentanyl are designed to be worn like a nicotine patch for 72 hours, releasing the drug slowly into the bloodstream.

It takes 12 hours for the full effects of the patch, often used for terminal illnesses, to wear off.

Several patients have claimed they became addicted to the drug.

He went to Bradford Royal Infirmary for painkillers where was prescribed Co-codamol but later that day when his symptoms persisted he contacted his mother Kew Hing Taylor.

In a statement Mrs Taylor said: 'On Saturday 8th February at 11.45am I received a call from Geoffrey. ‘I answered the call and he said he had been to hospital earlier that day and was at work but in a lot of pain. He asked for one of my morphine patches.'

She explained that she used the patches once every three days and had been using for the last five years.

The statement continued: 'On 8th February at 2pm Geoffrey came to my house and asked if he could have a morphine patch to relieve the pain in his back.'

During the brief five minute exchange between Kew Hing and her son, which would also be the last time she saw Geoffrey, she warned him that the morphine was very strong.

She said: 'I told him that the morphine would be too strong for him but he persisted and asked to use just the one.

'I gave him a box containing three and told him to use half a patch as they are very strong. I didn’t hear from him since.'

She said she found out about her son’s death the next day and added: 'I was so shocked and I rushed to their home right away.'

Mr Bates’ girlfriend Adele Henson, who is mother of his children Jack, five, and Alfie, three-months, said her partner had no health difficulties apart from his back problems.

She said: 'I was so shocked. He was only 38 and I loved him so much. I can’t recall him having any illnesses apart from back pain, which he has had for two years.'

'I want to offer each of you my continued sympathy as you seek to come to terms with the incredibly difficult situation'

Roger Whittaker, West Yorkshire coroner

Recording a verdict of accidental death West Yorkshire coroner Roger Whittaker, said: 'On the balance of probabilities I am satisfied by the medical cause of death was related to the medication he was taking.

'Clearly Geoffrey had been in a substantial amount of pain - more than he could have been expected to bear.

'I want to offer each of you my continued sympathy as you seek to come to terms with the incredibly difficult situation.'
