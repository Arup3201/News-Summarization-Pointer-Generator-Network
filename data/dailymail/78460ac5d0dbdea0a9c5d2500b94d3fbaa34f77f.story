It is a stunning declaration of love that would put a sparkle into any girl’s eyes.

As this first picture of Amal Alamuddin’s seven-carat diamond and platinum engagement ring shows, when George Clooney finally made up his mind to get married again he really meant it.

The 53-year-old US actor gave the ring – estimated to be worth around £450,000 – to British lawyer Miss Alamuddin, 36, when he proposed earlier this year.

The Hollywood star wooed his stunning fiancee with a string of flirty emails, it has today been reported.

George Clooney and Amal Alamuddin celebrate Rande Gerber's birthday in Santa Barbara, California, where she was pictured wearing her engagement ring

The Daily Mirror reports that Mr 
Clooney sent a tongue-in-cheek message to the lawyer after meeting her 
at a charity event, where she refused to take his number.

He
 reportedly sent her a jokey email suggesting that the 'reported hottest
 man in the world should meet with the hottest human rights lawyer in 
the world.'

Although she found the email amusing, she still made Clooney wait a few days for a reply, a friend told the paper.

She was pictured wearing the ring at a party recently where Clooney couldn’t have looked happier to be part of a couple.

He was married from 1989 to 1993 and later, despite a string of girlfriends, claimed he was not the marrying type.

As they sipped champagne to toast the birthday of his friend, businessman Rande Gerber, 52, Miss Alamuddin stroked the back of Clooney’s head.

She showed off the seven-carat diamond ring he presented her with when he proposed earlier this year.

Miss Alamuddin, 36, is a British humanitarian lawyer and was once voted the ‘hottest barrister in London’. Her clients have included Wikileaks founder Julian Assange.

She and Clooney have enjoyed a string of exotic holidays together in the past seven months.

She comes from a prominent intellectual Lebanese family who fled war-torn Beirut when she was a child and settled in a large modern house in Buckinghamshire.

Her mother, Baria, was a noted beauty when she was younger - a Liz Taylor of Lebanon, by all accounts.

Her father, Ramzi, is a retired professor of business studies at the American University of Beirut.

Clooney was married to actress Talia Balsam from 1989 to 1993.

Since then he has said that although he is not completely closed off to the idea of another wedding, he is not the marrying type.

Last December he told Esquire: ‘I haven’t had aspirations in that way, ever. I was married in 1989. I wasn’t very good at it.’

His previous girlfriends include British model Lisa Snowdon, former wrestler Stacy Keibler, cocktail waitress Sarah Larson, Italian actress Elisabetta Canalis and Baywatch star Krista Allen.
