Andrew Main (pictured) is accused of muiltiple arson attacks

A man has appeared in court after three fires were started within minutes of each other in an Oxfordshire village.

Andrew Main, 47, of Roke, Wallingford, appeared at Oxford Magistrates' Court in connection with fires set in south Oxfordshire in the early hours of Thursday morning.

He is charged with two counts of arson with intent to endanger life and two counts of arson reckless as to whether life was endangered. 

The charges relate to fires in Crowmarsh Gifford and Roke Marsh Farm. 

The South Oxfordshire Council offices, a funeral parlour and a thatched cottage were targeted, along with a building at the farm.

Main, who appeared at the short hearing wearing a plain grey tracksuit, nodded when asked if his personal details were correct.

He was remanded in custody to appear at Oxford Crown Court on January 30. 

Firefighters launched a massive operation involving 27 crews to control the the blazes.

All three fires had been started within 10 minutes of each other.

Plumes of smoke were still seen rising from the building this morning and took fire crews hours to control 

Jean Gladstone, 80, whose cottage was torched revealed how she only had time to save a bunch of birthday roses from the flames

The first blaze was at pensioner Jean Gladstone's home, followed by a second at Chadwick Howard Funeral Service in Benson Lane in the village of Crowmarsh Gifford.

The third happened when a car crashed into the office of South Oxfordshire District Council - also in Benson Lane - before it burst into flames.

Gas canisters were found at each site and 30 residents had to be evacuated after police discovered a stash of canisters in a house in Roke Marsh and bomb disposal teams were called in. 

The three fires were started within close proximity of each other and all within 10 minutes on Thursday
