Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has blamed England for Daniel Sturridge's injury, criticising the international side's coaching and recovery methods.

The Liverpool striker missed England's 2-0 win over Switzerland after picking up a knock in training and returning to Merseyside.

Sturridge will now miss Liverpool's clash with Aston Villa on Saturday, as well as the Champions League tie against Ludogorets on Tuesday.

But Rodgers thinks the injury could have been prevented and questioned the approach of England's coaching and medical staff.

He told talkSPORT: 'We're disappointed because we feel it's an injury which could have been prevented. Clubs work differently to international teams, it's the recovery strategy. 

'When we look at our players here, we look at them individually, in terms of what their needs are.'

Rodgers added: 'Some players are very fast, they will have a second day, active recovery, whereas other players can work on that [second] day.

Daniel Sturridge could be out for up to two weeks but should return for the Merseyside derby

'When you're a type of player like Raheem Sterling or Daniel Sturridge, you need to recover them differently.'

Liverpool face a busy schedule in September with West Ham next up after Ludogorets, followed by a Capital One Cup tie against Middlesbrough and the Merseyside derby against Everton on September 27.

'He's one to two weeks away [from playing again],' Rodgers added on Sturridge. 'It's disappointing for him because he's worked so hard in pre-season and looked very fit and strong in the last game against Tottenham.'
