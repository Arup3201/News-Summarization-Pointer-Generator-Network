An artistic mother rediscovered her passion for painting by using her children’s faces as her canvas, turning them into monsters and zombies.

Christy Lewis has her daughters squealing with delight as she transforms them into everything from giraffes to superheroes.

Kiera, seven and Maddi, five, has to sit still for more than two hours in order to go from cherub-cheeked children into cave trolls, E.T. or The Hulk.

Enviable talent: Christy Lewis has painted one of her daughters as Avengers hero Incredible Hulk

Christy, who lives in Wellington New 
Zealand with her family always had a passion for art, but found that she no longer had the time to paint when she had her daughters and nine-month-old son Fletcher.

This changed when she discovered a pack of face paints buried in a cupboard and began sketching a design on her daughter.

Christy, who also offers belly 
painting to pregnant women, decided to combine her hobby with motherhood
and her face painting skills were soon in high demand.

Her designs proved so popular in her 
community that she started her own face painting business - Daizy Design
Face Painting - with husband Mark.

Together, they have turned hundreds of
boys and girls into zombies, animals and even The Incredible Hulk and 
skull masks in celebration of Dia De Muertos.

Mexican madness: Maddi Lewis, five, has been painted as a traditional Dia De Muertos skull

What are you looking at: The adorable little girl has been transformed into a scary looking cave troll

Living canvas: Oldest daughter Keira, seven, with an award-winning peacock design

Back from the dead: Christy's arty face paintings, such as this one where she has turned one of her children into a scary zombie, saw her set up her own face painting business

Christy, from Wellington, New Zealand, said: ‘What greater canvas is there than one that smiles back at you?

‘My favourite reactions are those of the shyest children who see themselves for the first time in the mirror.

‘They suddenly light up and run around roaring at everybody.’

As well as nailing famous faces such as Super Mario and E.T., Christy has won awards for her blue peacock and giraffe designs.

Her work has grown in demand and she 
has been invited to teach classes at the Face and Body Art International
Convention in Florida, in May.

Phone home: Maddi's smile is almost impossible to distinguish behind her E.T. face painting

Fun and computer games: Christy doesn't just turn her daughters into beautiful fantasy creatures and scary monsters - a mustachioed Italian plumber with a passion for mushrooms is equally popular

No-gaffe-giraffe: Kiera models her mother's prize winning giraffe design

Inspiring: Christy's talent for face painting has seen her receive an invitation to share her skills as a teacher at the Face and Body Art International Convention in Florida this spring

Painting the nest: Mrs Lewis also uses her talents to paint pregnant women's bellies, such as this one which has been decorated with a swan and its cygnet
