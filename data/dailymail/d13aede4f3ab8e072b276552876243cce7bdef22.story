An Indianapolis woman is outraged after her husband, who was sentenced Friday for drugging then raping her as she slept in her own bed, received no jail time.

Even more infuriating for Mandy Boardman were the words of Marion Superior Judge Kurt Eisgruber as he handed down a suspended prison sentence and eight years home detention.

'The judge looked at me before he gave the final decision,' Boardman told the IndyStar. 'I was told that I needed to forgive my attacker and move on.'

Injustice: Mandy Boardman's rapist husband received no jail time when a judge sentenced him Friday before telling her she needed to forgive him and move on

The dumbfounded mother of two said she doesn’t believe she received justice and that the judgment made her feel like she was ‘sucker punched in the gut’ to know that her ex-husband David Wise, 52, won’t see the inside of a prison.

A jury convicted Wise last month of one count of rape and five counts of criminal deviate conduct — all felonies punishable by six to 20 years in prison.

Boardman testified that in 2008 she found three sex videos of her on Wise’s cellphone but didn’t remember the sex or consenting to the videos. She said she once woke up with a pill dissolving in her mouth.

Boardman, who was married to Wise for 12 years until their 2009 divorce, said she made a DVD copy of the videos and went to police with them in 2011.

Boardman decided to speak out publicly about the case, presumably because of its outcome.

‘I received zero justice on Friday,’ she said.

Wise’s defense attorney, Elizabeth Milliken, told The Indianapolis Star that Wise intends to appeal his conviction but declined additional comment.

Judge Kurt Eisgruber declined to comment on the sentencing decision because of the planned appeal.

Wise has no previous felony convictions, according to the Marion County prosecutor’s office. He has been convicted of battery, public indecency and driving while intoxicated, all of which are misdemeanors.

Wise no longer has visitation rights for the couple’s son and daughter and spent 24 days in jail following his arrest.

Marion County Deputy Prosecutor Courtney Curtis said prosecutors sought a sentence against Wise that included prison time.

‘There is no difference when a woman knows her attacker and when she doesn’t,’ Curtis said. ‘I think it is important to remember that this crime is one that was committed in the home and so serving a home sentence in the home is not something this office would ever ask for.’

Boardman said she plans to work with organizations and advocates to help other rape victims.

‘I want to be that person who’ll be strong for other women,’ she said. ‘They cannot be scared that because of the extremely light sentence that was handed down in this case, that it would happen to them as well.’

While Wise is banned from seeing his ex-wife, the former couple has two children. Wise is fighting for shared custody.

Complications: Now as Wise appeals his conviction and Boardman tries to get him prison time for his crimes, stuck in the middle are the ex-couple's two children. Wise is seeking shared custody
