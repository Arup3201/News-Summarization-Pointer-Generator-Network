A group of Australian golfing buddies have taken on British super group Queen's most iconic hit, Bohemian Rhapsody, in a seven-minute parody littered with sporting references.

The clip posted by Nigel Tait on YouTube draws from the original music video, including the easily recognisable opening scene of Freddie Mercury and his band mates in the shadows mouthing the four-part harmony of the song's opening lines.

In this re-imagined version, Mr Tait and three of his eight friends kick off the video with: 'Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Four days of golfing and an escape from reality.'

Nigel Tait and his friends decided to make a golfing parody of Queen's iconic hit, Bohemian Rhapsody

The group of eight golfing buddies take an annual trip touring the Murray River golf courses in South Australia

Keeping true to Queen's original film clip, the use of fading in and out of scenes is seen throughout as well as a solo guitarist playing the famous riff.

In another reinvented line, instead of 'Mama didn't mean to make you cry, if I'm not back again this time tomorrow', Mr Tait - who did the vocals and played the instruments - sings 'Mama didn’t mean to make it slice, I’m going back for more lessons tomorrow.'

So far the video has attracted more than 20,000 views.

With the video, Mr Tait wrote it was a 'culmination of 10 years parody song writing for our annual golf trip to the Murray River courses in [South Australia]'.

During these trips, which have happened over 10 years, the group have written Queen parodies

This seven-minute video drew from Queen's original film clip of the song and featured many of the same elements, including a shot of hands playing a piano

The video has so far attracted more than 20,000 views on YouTube

'It all started with a protest song and after that being well-received, parody songs became an annual feature of the trip,' he said.

'After years of raising the standard of song production, one year we decided to produce a six-song album dedicated to the legendary Queen, titled "A Day on the Greens".

'The only criticism of the album was its failure to include Bohemian Rhapsody. I took it on as a challenge.'

The parody album, A Day on the Greens, is a take on Queen's fifth studio album, A Day at the Races.

The song is littered with golfing references as well as scene incorporating the sports' equipment

The group also released a six-song album of Queen parodies, which did not include this hit
