Liverpool have been in training as pre-season heads towards it's conclusion and the Premier League gets ready to begin.

Daniel Sturridge, Raheem Sterling, Phillippe Coutinho and Jordan Henderson were among those in action at Liverpool's training base on Friday morning as they ready themselves for the new campaign.

Brendan Rodgers was also in the thick of the action as he prepares to take charge of his third season with the Merseyside club.

As well as the old guard, new arrivals Javi Manquillo, Rickie Lambert and Dejan Lovren were all there as they prepared for potential Premier League debuts for the club.

Both Lambert and Lovren could both make their first official appearances for Liverpool against the side they just left, as Southampton travel to Anfield on Sunday for a 13.30 kick off, but other Saints arrival Adam Lallana remains sidelined with injury.

And it will be vital for the Reds to get off to a winning start against Southampton, as they face trips to Manchester City and Tottenham in their next two Premier League encounters. 

Last season, Southampton were one of just two teams to leave Anfield with victory, after Lovren scored against his future side to give them a 1-0 win in September.

Liverpool will be hoping to go one better than last season, after finishing runners up to eventual winners Manchester City. 

And Rodgers will be hoping to add a couple more faces to his ever-expanding squad, as he hopes to compete on four fronts this campaign.

And when asked about his transfer business for the summer in his pre-season press conference, Rodgers said: 'We are nearly done. We have one or two more things to complete.

'If we can add one or two more to the areas we want to we will have had a great window and it will set us up.

'This summer will probably be our biggest window for the next couple of years.

'We are looking to make this a sustainable team for the next five to 10 years.

'We have brought in a lot of young talent so we are trying to look after the now but also the future of the team.

'We had a sustained challenge on the Premier League last season with 12 or 13 players so, irrespective of what happened with players going out in the summer, we needed more depth.

'I am really happy and pleased with the players we have brought in as that will allow us to cope with injuries and competitions.'
