Presidential hopeful: Rick Santorum has criticised President Barack Obama's apology for the burning of Korans at a U.S base in Afghanistan

Rick Santorum has condemned President Barack Obama's apology for the burning of Korans at a U.S base in Afghanistan.

The Republican presidential hopeful added that Afghanistan should apologise to the U.S. for the deaths of four U.S. soldiers during six days of violence sparked by the incident.

'There was nothing deliberately done wrong here,' Santorum told ABC's This Week today.

'This was something that happened as a mistake. Killing Americans in uniform is not a mistake. It was something that deliberate.'

The comments came as it emerged that two senior U.S. military advisers shot dead in their office yesterday were targeted after they failed to take protests seriously.

And another eight U.S. servicemen were wounded in a grenade attack today in the violent protests that have engulfed Afghanistan this week, killing around 30 people. At least two demonstrators were also killed.

'The response needs to be apologized 
for by (President Hamid) Karzai and the Afghan people for attacking and 
killing our men and women in uniform and overreacting to this 
inadvertent mistake,' Santorum explained on NBC's 'Meet the Press'. 
'That is the real crime here, not what our soldiers did.'

The
 president's apology suggests that there is blame and that the U.S. did 
something wrong 'in the sense of doing a deliberate act,' Santorum said.

Santorum
 says that rather than saying he was sorry, Obama should have only 
acknowledged that burning copies of Islam's holiest book in a trash pit 
was wrong and taken responsibility for the incident, 'but to apologise, I
 think, lends credibility that somehow or another that it was more than 
that.'

Santorum is the latest Republican to criticise Obama for apologising for burning the religious materials. Despite apologies from the president and other U.S. officials for what they said was a mistake, their regrets have not quelled the anger of Afghans, who viewed the Quran burnings as an illustration of what they perceive as foreign disrespect for their culture and religion.

Today's protest turned violent as 400 demonstrators stormed a U.S forward operating base in the northern province of Kundaz's largest city. An official says people in the crowd fired on police.

NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) confirmed there had been an explosion outside one of its bases.

Afghan authorities launched a massive 
manhunt for a suspect in the execution of the two advisers 
inside the Ministry of the Interior compound.

'There is a suspect who is an 
employee of the Interior Ministry. He has been identified. Right now the
 police are trying to arrest him. He is on the run,' the Afghan Interior
 Ministry said in a statement, citing initial findings by investigators.

Meanwhile an account of events inside the Ministry has surfaced.

The two advisers had been mocking the demonstrators, according to a government source

As they watched video footage of 
protesters the two senior officers 'scolding the protesters and calling 
them bad names,'the anonymous source told the New York Post.

'They called the Koran a bad book in 
the presence of the guy. After all this the guy had verbal arguments 
with the advisers and was threatened by them. He gets angry and shoots 
them. Eight rounds were fired at them.'

'He then sneaks out and disappears. 
No one knew about the incident for more than an hour because the room is
 soundproofed,' he said. CCTV footage has been viewed as part of the 
investigation.

The suspect has been named locally as
 25-year-old Abdul Saboor, who had studied in Pakistan who had risen 
through the ranks after coming to work at the ministry as a driver in 
2007.

In an unprecedented measure all NATO personnel have been 
recalled from Afghan ministries.

About 30 people have been killed in 
the violence since it emerged Tuesday that copies of the Muslim holy 
book and other religious materials had been thrown into a fire pit used 
to burn garbage at Bagram Air Field, a large U.S. base north of Kabul.

Afghan President Hamid Karzai renewed his calls for calm in a televised address to the nation Sunday.

'Now is the time to return to calm 
and not let our enemies use this situation,' he said. Asked about the 
unprecedented recall of NATO staff, Karzai said it was understandable.

'It is a temporary step at a time when the people of Afghanistan are angry over the burning of the holy Quran,' Karzai said.

The Taliban claimed that the shooter 
was one of their sympathisers and that an accomplice had helped him get 
into the compound to kill the Americans in retaliation for the Quran 
burnings.

Members of the international military
 coalition described the removal of advisers as a temporary security 
measure, stressing that they did not expect it to affect partnerships 
with the Afghans that are key to preparing the country's security forces
 to take on more responsibility as international troops draw down.

'We continue to move forward and 
stand by our Afghan partners in this campaign. We will not let this 
divide the coalition,' said Lt. Col. Jimmie Cummings, a spokesman for 
the international force. The NATO recall affects advisers numbered 'in 
the low hundreds,' Cummings said.

The U.S. government had already 
ordered its government advisers to stay inside the secure embassy 
compound earlier in the week out of fear of retribution, said Gavin 
Sundwall, a U.S. Embassy spokesman.

Catherine Arnold, a spokeswoman for the 
British Embassy, said Britain that 'as a temporary measure' the embassy 
has 'withdrawn civilian mentors and advisers from institutions within 
Kabul and that we're keeping the situation under review.' She declined 
to say how many people were affected by the decision.

President Barack Obama and other U.S.
 officials have apologised for what they said was a mistake, but their 
regrets did not quell the anger of Afghans, who viewed the Quran 
burnings as an illustration of what they perceive as foreign disrespect 
for their culture and religion.

The attacks on U.S. service members
 were the latest in a rising number of incidents where Afghan soldiers 
or policemen, or gunmen wearing their uniforms, have killed NATO forces.
 Last month, France suspended its training program and threatened to 
withdraw its forces from Afghanistan a year ahead of schedule after an 
Afghan soldier shot and killed four French soldiers on a base in the 
east.

NATO 
forces had advisers embedded in many Afghan ministries, both as trainers
 and to help manage the transition to Afghan control and foreign forces 
prepare to withdraw by the end of 2014.

The Afghan Interior Ministry oversees all of the country's police, so had numerous NATO advisers.

Inevitably the latest shooting has 
raised questions over security at what should be one of the most secure 
compounds in the city. 

General John Allen said the recall of advisers is
 'for obvious force protection reasons' but the alliance remains 
committed to its partnership with the Afghan government.

He said NATO is investigating Saturday's shooting and will pursue all leads to find the person responsible for the attack.

'The perpetrator of this attack is a coward whose actions will not go unanswered,' Allen said

The fatal shooting comes soon after three protesters were shot dead by Afghan security forces.

The situation was already fragile as 
NATO forces attempt to bring stability to the region before foreign 
troops withdraw by the end of 2014.

But the unstable country has 
smouldered this week as thousands of Afghans took to the streets to 
protest the burning of Korans by U.S soldiers.

Despite
 a call for restraint from Afghan leader Hamid Karzai, renewed protests 
continue. 12 people were killed and dozens wounded on Friday, the
 bloodiest day yet in demonstrations. Around 30 people have been killed and hundreds wounded since Tuesday.

Six Afghan soldiers have also been 
killed and 16 others were wounded today while trying to defuse a 
roadside bomb in the Mukar district of the Baghdis province in western 
Afghanistan.

with deep reverence with desecration considered one of the worst forms 
of blasphemy.

The
 Koran burnings underscore the deep cultural divide that still exists 
more than 10 years after U.S troops invaded to oust the Taliban and have
 deepened public mistrust of the West.

Violent protest have endured across three Afghan provinces this week.

Protests also broke out in 
Pakistan yesterday as Muslim marched in support of the demonstrations in 
Afghanistan over the burning of the Koran.    

The
 ongoing protests could dent plans for a strategic pact that Washington 
is considering with Kabul, which would allow a sharply reduced number of
 Western troops to stay in the country, well beyond their combat exit 
deadline.
