Police have released before and after pictures of an Oregon beauty queen who turned into a drug addict - and the contrast is enough to scare any junkie straight. 

Jamie Lynn France, 23, was arrested on drugs charges on Wednesday after being caught in a motel room full of drugs along with her alleged dealer.

France, who won the Miss Teen Oregon-World pageant in 2009, was charged with possession of methamphetamine, heroin and suboxene.

She has been held on $30,000 bail, bonded out, The Oregonian reported.

France was caught as part of a five-month investigation into Jarrod Wells. Raids on the Keizer home he shared with his partner Erin, 37, on Tuesday uncovered more than one ounce of heroin, several grams of methamphetamine and some hallucinogenic mushrooms.

Two boys, aged four and seven, were taken into care of a relative.

Detectives then traced Jarrod Wells to a motel off a busy interstate, about three miles from the home, where he was found along with France. 

Police found heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and records of drug sales in the room.

Drug paraphernalia was found at the house Jarrod and Erin Wells shared along with more than one ounce of heroin, several grams of methamphetamine and some hallucinogenic mushrooms

Wells was charged with possession of methamphetamine, delivery of methamphetamine within 1000 feet of a school, child neglect, heroin possession, frequenting a place where controlled substances are used and possession of a controlled substance.

His partner was booked on suspicion of child neglect, methamphetamine possession, heroin possession and frequenting a place where controlled substances are used.

Police later released France's booking photograph and a picture of  her before she started using drugs, to warn people about the dangers of using illicit substances. In one photo France looks happy and fresh-face, in the other she is gaunt, washed-out looking and pimply.

Hallucinogenic mushrooms can be seen in a small container found at the Wells' home in Oregon

Two boys aged four and seven that were found at the address were released into the care of other relatives

'The Keizer Police Department would like to take this opportunity to caution against the use of illegal controlled substances because of the terrible long-term affects to the user, their families and our communities,' Keizer police cautioned in a release.

According to her Facebook page France, who recently moved from Redmond, claims she nearly died in a car accident earlier this year and then lost her job.

She wrote on her profile: 'Filled with lots of heart break and anguish,' she wrote. 'When am I gonna get a break?'
