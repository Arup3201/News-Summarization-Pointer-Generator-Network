Paranoid about looking like a frump in your gym kit? Look away now.

Victoria's Secret model Karlie Kloss has just been unveiled as the new face of Nike and shows off her enviable figure and natural glow in the campaign imagery.

Wearing her hair in a messy bun with barely a scrap of make-up on, Karlie displays her toned ballerina's body all while modelling the sportswear brand's AW14 range.

Abs-olutely stunning: Karlie Kloss has opened up about her grueling fitness regime, admitting that her SoulCycle instructor 'usually calls her out' because she tends to be 'one beat off of the rest of the class'

The 21-year-old supermodel, who trained as a classical ballerina growing up, emphasises how important exercise is to her and says it's when she feels at her best.

Speaking to Grazia Daily, she said: 'Movement is everything. A body in motion stays in motion. I have a lot of body, so I like to keep it moving.

'For me, that can be anything from dancing to going for a run. I travel a lot, so I’m constantly on the move, but even when I’m traveling, I make sure to stay active because that’s when I feel my best.'

Natural beauty: The 21-year-old clothes horse wears barely any make-up in her new campaign, despite recently revealing that she has a spare bedroom to store all of her beauty products in

Fighting fit: The sculpted stunner switches it up with a wide range of workouts; including ballet, Pilates, weights training, running and spinning

Old school: 'My favorite trick for defined abs are good old-fashioned sit-ups,' she says. 'It's something you don't need any equipment or trainer for and you can do anytime.'

The model may have recently revealed that she has a separate room for all her beauty products, but has also admitted that she's a tomboy at heart.

'I love football. I am obsessed,' she said. 'I have my own fantasy football team and love going to games. I love the strategy that goes into the plays. I’ve looked through playbooks before and it’s like playing chess.'

Rise to fame: Karlie, whose modelling career started at Abercrombie, has seen her star rise rapidly in recent years and she's fronted all the biggest fashion campaigns

The young star, who 
appears in the July issue of ELLE, revealed: 'I have a whole second 
bedroom filled with products, but I stick to the things that work.'

She
 adds: 'I like products that streamline my morning routine. Sunday Riley
 has a really good foundation; it’s very velvety. I love RMS “Un” 
Cover-Up for under eyes or on a blemish.'

She
 also credits Living Proof shampoo and conditioner, for making her hair 
'bounce in a different way,' and mentions that Laura Mercier tinted 
moisturizer is also 'good.'
