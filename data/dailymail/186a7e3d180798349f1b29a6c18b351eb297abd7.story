Famous: This painting by Edouard Manet has been saved for the nation after an eight-month campaign raised almost £8million to buy it

A portrait by French painter Edouard Manet has been saved for the nation after an eight-month campaign raised almost £8 million to buy it.

The oil painting, Portrait Of Mademoiselle Claus, was sold to a foreign buyer last year for £28.35 million but the Government put an export bar on it and under the terms of its sale it was made available to a British public institution for just over a quarter of its market value.

The campaign, which included donations from more than 1,000 members of the public, succeeded in raising the £7.83 million needed to buy it for its new home at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.

Public donations ranged from £1.50 to 
£10,000 and were added to £5.9 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund 
and £850,000 from The Art Fund.

Museum director Christopher Brown said: 'The public’s response to the campaign for the Manet has been overwhelming.

'The
museum is enormously grateful to the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Art 
Fund, other foundations and many individuals who contributed so 
generously and helped us save Manet for the public.

'To
have succeeded in acquiring the portrait this year, when the UK is in 
the international spotlight, is something of which the museum and the 
entire country can be proud.

'This
is one of the most important pictures of the 19th century, which has 
been in Britain since its sale following the artist’s death in 1884.

'Its
acquisition has transformed the Ashmolean’s collection and has at a 
stroke made Oxford into a leading centre for the study of Impressionist 
painting.'

The picture, which dates from 1868, is a portrait of musician Fanny Claus who was a friend of Manet’s wife and is the first version of his work, The Balcony, which hangs in the Musee d’Orsay in Paris.

The cropped composition, vibrant 
colours and bravura brushwork would have been startling in comparison to
the traditional French Academic paintings of the period. 

The unfinished full length portrait has only been seen in public once in the last century.

It was purchased by the American painter
John Singer Sargent in 1884 after Manet’s death and has remained in the
United Kingdom ever since.

Manet, who died in 1883, is regarded as one of the founding fathers of modern art.

During his lifetime he was 
controversial, but his work, though it shocked the public, was hugely 
admired by artists. His reputation grew rapidly in the 20th century and 
consequently his best works were acquired by major museums.

There are now remarkably few Manets in 
private collections, almost all in France, and there are only a handful 
of important pictures by Manet in the United Kingdom – in the National 
Gallery and the Courtauld Institute in London, as well as other works in
Cardiff, Birmingham, and Glasgow.

Culture Minister Ed Vaizey said he was 'delighted' the painting would stay in the UK.

He said: 'I congratulate the Ashmolean on their campaign and it’s wonderful that Manet’s painting will now be on public display where it can be enjoyed and appreciated by all.'

The painting will be lent to a succession of museums and galleries in a nationwide tour next year.
