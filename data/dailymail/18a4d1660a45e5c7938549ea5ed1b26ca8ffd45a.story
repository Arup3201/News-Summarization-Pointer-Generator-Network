Chelsea midfielder Josh McEachran has signed for Eredivisie side Vitesse Arnhem on a season-long loan.

The 21-year-old will join up with his new team-mates on Monday after agreeing the move and he becomes the third Chelsea player at the Dutch club with Brazilian full back Wallace and midfielder Bertrand Traore already making the switch.

McEachran has been looking for a temporary move away from the Stamford Bridge club after Jose Mourinho left him out of their pre season preparations, but with moves to English and Spanish clubs falling through he will now follow the path of a number of other Blues' youngsters.
