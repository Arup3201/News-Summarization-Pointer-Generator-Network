It may be unusual bedtime reading for the President of the United States.

But Barack Obama today picked up a copy of the novel which inspired the dystopian war film Apocalypse Now at a publicity appearance to promote small businesses.

Alongside some children's titles weighty non-fiction books on medicine and China, the President picked up Joseph Conrad's classic Heart of Darkness on a visit to the Politics and Prose bookstore in Washington, D.C.

The novella, a mainstay of high school and university literature programs, was the main source material for Apocalypse Now, a film which details the madness and slaughter of the Vietnam War.

Conrad's original, published in 1899, was set along the Congo River in Africa, and tells the story of ivory trader Marlow finding the feared Mr Kurtz, a European who has gone mad in the jungle and rules over a tribe of natives.

The work has been lauded for its feverish portrayal , and Kurtz's last words 'The horror... the horror' have become iconic.

Many have taken it as a criticism of the way Western civilization at the time asserted its dominance on the world.

Likewise, the Hollywood adaptation - which casts Marlow and Kurtz as U. S. servicemen in Vietnam - has been taken as a criticism of America's intervention in the affairs of other countries, as well as a more general examination of the darkness in human nature.

Inspiration: Heart of Darkness, the Joseph Conrad book on the President's reading list, was the basis for the Vietnam war film Apocalypse Now (pictured above starring Martin Sheen)

Meaningful? Apocalypse Now transferred the scepticism of the West's actions in Africa to the Vietnam war

'Small Business Saturday': Obama's trip to the store came as part of a push for consumers to visit independent retailers

It worked! Obama made a joke about his credit card to the checkout attendant, after he was declined in a New York City restaurant this year

Obama's visit came on a day increasingly advertised as 'Small Business Saturday', an attempt to lure shoppers to mom-and-pop retailers after the mass consumption madness of Black Friday.

Obama bought 17 books in total at Politics and Prose, which is owned by two former staffers at the Washington Post.

The President browsed the bookstore's racks with his daughters, Malia and Sasha. He held one shopper's baby and chatted with author David Baldacci. While paying at the cash register, another patron encouraged Obama to close the U.S. facility in Cuba where suspected terrorists are detained.

'Hope you can close Guantanamo,' the patron said.

'We're working on it,' Obama replied, then added to the crowd: 'Any other issues?'

Obama also joked, 'Hope it works,' when he handed his credit card to the cashier, in reference to an incident earlier this year when a New York City restaurant declined his card.

Obama bought a mix of titles apparently chosen to satisfy readers young and old. The White House declined to reveal how much he paid. 

Obama and his daughters also shopped at Politics and Prose on the Saturday after Thanksgiving last year.
