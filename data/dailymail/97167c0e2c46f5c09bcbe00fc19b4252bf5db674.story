HSBC chairman Douglas Flint told MPs he was 'very ashamed' by the bank's conduct

HSBC could face a criminal probe in the UK over claims that its Swiss private bank helped wealthy clients evade tax, it emerged yesterday.

Investigations into the High Street banking giant have already been launched in France, Belgium, Switzerland and the US.

Yesterday HMRC boss Lin Homer signalled that an inquiry into the scandal could now take place in Britain.

She told MPs on the Treasury Committee a 'multi agency' meeting next week would assess if it was possible to 'pursue wider offences'. 

The Serious Fraud Office, the Financial Conduct Authority, Crown Prosecution Service, City of London Police, National Crime Agency and EU crime agency Eurojust would attend.

The move paves the way for a criminal investigation in the UK into HSBC and its clients.  

HMRC has come under fire for prosecuting just one person from a list of 3,600 HSBC customers with Swiss bank accounts handed to it by French authorities in 2010.

Yesterday Stuart Gulliver, HSBC’s chief executive since 2011, and chairman Douglas Flint were summoned to give evidence to the Treasury Committee.

Appearing in public for the first time since the scandal emerged earlier this month, Mr Flint admitted the bank had ‘suffered horrible reputational damage’ and said he felt ‘very ashamed’ by what happened. 

HSBC has been rocked by a string of controversies, including PPI mis-selling, interest rate derivative mis-selling, foreign exchange manipulation and violation of international sanctions.

Mr Flint said: 'It is a terrible list ... One of the most humbling things that has happened in my career is a recognition of all the things you did not know, and you go and say "what could I have known or what should I have known?"'

'What these instances have illustrated or brought to the fore is that allowing interpretation at 88 countries as it was at the time is the wrong way to go and we should centralise control.' 

Mr Gulliver also told MPs the revelations had caused 'damage to trust and confidence' in the company and apologised for the Swiss private bank's ‘unacceptable practices’. 

The chief executive - who has worked for HSBC for 35 years  - told MPs: 'I would like to put on the record an apology from both myself and Douglas for the unacceptable events that took place at our private bank in Switzerland in the mid-2000s.'

He added: 'It is an apology we would like to make to you, our customers, our shareholders and the public at large.

'It clearly was unacceptable. We very much regret this, and it has damaged HSBC's reputation.' 

Asked precisely what he was apologising for, Mr Gulliver went on: 'The lack of controls and practices which now - judged with the benefit of hindsight - we would not be at all comfortable with if they were happening today, and which have clearly resulted in damage to trust and confidence in HSBC and created further reputational damage to our firm and have therefore hurt clients, customers, shareholders, our staff and people at large.' 

But he immediately came under fire for his own personal finances, following revelations he paid around £5million of bonuses into a Swiss bank account via a Panamanian holding company.

Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie questioned why Mr Gulliver ‘felt the need’ to put in place such ‘extraordinary arrangements’, which lasted between 1998 and 2009.

Mr Gulliver admitted the scheme will look ‘strange’ to the general public. But there was ‘no tax advantage’ and it was set up purely to keep his bonuses secret from colleagues.

The Derby-born 55-year-old added: ‘I myself grew up in Plymouth, I went to a state school so I can understand how the public perceives these issues.’

MPs also questioned why Mr Gulliver is domiciled for tax purposes in Hong Kong, despite being posted back to the UK by HSBC in 2003.

He said he and his wife intend to move back to Hong Kong when he retires as chief executive and added that he had spent most of his 35-year career with HSBC in the former British colony. He said he has paid full UK tax on his earnings since 2003. 

Mr Tyrie told him: 'You've said you're trying to clean everything up. Some years ago, you were certainly muddying the waters with these extraordinary tax arrangements, weren't you?'

HSBC is having to weather yet more controversy after the United States named it as one of the banks it's investigating over the possible manipulation of precious metals markets

The HSBC chief executive replied: 'I can understand how people find these arrangements kind of unusual. I myself grew up in Plymouth, I went to a state school, so I can understand why the public would find them unfamiliar and rather strange.'

Mr Gulliver said he left the UK in 1980 with the intention of spending his career overseas, and had made his home in Hong Kong and set up the Panamanian 'nominee entity' in 1998 to channel his pay from the bank.

'There was no tax advantage or purpose whatsover to the Panamanian company. It was a Panamanian nominee entity constructed purely to give me privacy within my own company,' he said.

'At that point in 1998, my compensation was not a matter of public record. When I became a director of HSBC in 2008, my compensation became public and that structure was wound up in 2009.

'It was purely about privacy from colleagues in Hong Kong and Switzerland. We had a computer system back in the day that allowed everybody to inquire into staff accounts ... I was amongst the highest paid people and I wished to preserve my privacy from colleagues. Nothing more than that.' 

But Labour MP Mike Kane said: ‘You yourself with your own tax affairs look like you’re at the outer limits of aggressive tax avoidance. Do you think you have the moral authority to carry on this change process at HSBC?’

Mr Gulliver responded: ‘I believe the changes I have made to the firm clearly demonstrate the sincerity of my desire actually to change HSBC.’

Efforts to clean up the bank were stepped up after HSBC was fined £1.2billion in the US in 2012 for laundering money for Mexican drugs gangs. Asked by Tory MP David Ruffley whether he accepted the public expected ‘atonement’ for these latest transgressions in Switzerland, Mr Flint said ‘absolutely’.

But he pinned the blame on executives who led the HSBC group private banking operation during the time in question.

He said Chris Meares and Clive Bannister – son of four minute mile legend Sir Roger Bannister – ‘certainly bear a fairly direct responsibility for what went on in the private bank during their stewardship’.

This week the bank disclosed profits slumped by 17 per cent last year.
