A charity fundraiser who fell 350ft off a Swiss mountain in a freak accident has woken from a coma and spoken of his joy of spending Christmas at home.

Roger Parker, 54, who has raised £100,000 for Macmillan Cancer, was abseiling down a glacier with a climbing team in August when the rock his rope was attached to crumbled.

The father-of-three fell on to an icy ledge before it collapsed and he plummeted further down the mountain breaking his left leg in two places.

The design engineer was taken from Switzerland to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge where he remained in a coma.

Mr Parker, from Cambridge, said he is 'just grateful to be alive' and to have been able to spend Christmas with his wife Lesley-Ann, 53,and three children.

He said: 'I really appreciated it after all that has happened this year. I am coping quite well but my right side is a bit vague. The rehabilitation has been great and I am walking at a fair rate and hope to get back to what I was one day.'

Mr Parker began fundraising for Macmillan in 2000 after his friend and employee James Page died of stomach cancer at the age of 27.

His challenges have included walking the Inca trail in Peru, climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, the North Col of Everest and Aconcagua in the Andes. 

News of his accident attracted support from well-wishers around the country, with the family inundated with cards and voicemails.

Messages of support and a signed shirt were even sent to the Merseyside native from Everton Football Club’s manager David Moyes and some of their star players, who wished him a speedy recovery and praised his charitable efforts.

Mr Parker was in the coma until October and was allowed home shortly before Christmas.

Mrs Parker said this week: 'We call it Parker's Christmas miracle and it is just so wonderful to have him back and alive.

'It's just the simple things like having Christmas dinner with him that is just amazing. Things that you normally take for granted.'

Maureen Rutter, director of direct services at Macmillan, said: 'We are so grateful for the fundraising he has done so far and this new appeal. It will make a real difference to the lives of people affected by cancer.'
