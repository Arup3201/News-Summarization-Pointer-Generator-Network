The U.S has offered a $5million bounty for the capture of a Chinese fugitive accused of supplying Iran's weapons program with ballistic missile parts.

Li Fangwei, who is also known as Karl 
Lee, and two of his companies LIMMT Economic and Trade Company have been on U.S. sanctions lists since 2006 and 2009 respectively.

Now the fugitive faces further sanctions as well as charges of money laundering, wire fraud and other crimes as 
part of an indictment issued by the New York City Justice Department.

Nearly $7million has also been seized from by companies he allegedly set up as a front to evade sanctions previously imposed on him, prosecutors say.

He is thought to have done $8.5million in business in more 
than 165 separate transactions through the 'shell' companies.

Prosecutors add Li, who is said to control a network of companies in China which have done 
millions of dollars in business with Iran, has supplied the 
country with ballistic missile parts for many years.

Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney for Manhattan said: 'Previously having been exposed as a 
violator of those sanctions, Li spun a web of front companies to carry 
out prohibited transactions essentially in disguise.

'He now stands 
charged with serious crimes, and millions of his dollars have been 
seized.'

John Carlin, assistant attorney general 
for national security, said in a statement released: 'These 
actions send a loud and clear warning to those involved in the illegal 
proliferation of sensitive materials to Iran that the United States will
 not spare any efforts to disrupt their actions and bring them to 
justice.'

According to the indictment, Li went 'underground' after the 2006 and 2009 sanctions - continuing to deal with Iran but 
through his front companies and using aliases and fake business names to
 hide the beneficiaries of electronic wire transfers.

Though
 money was moved through U.S.-based financial institutions, no bank is 
accused of any wrongdoing, the Justice Department said.

The renewed effort to prosecute Mr Li comes as discussions regarding Iran's nuclear program are reach a critical phase.

They also come as the U.S. increases its sanctions against Russia - targeting scores of government officials and companies with ties to President Vladimir Putin over the continuing crisis in Ukraine.
