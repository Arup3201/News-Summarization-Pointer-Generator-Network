A special education teacher in Texas is being sued after allegations arose that she locked an autistic student in a filing cabinet, pulled another’s hair out, and called her students ‘retarded.’

Julie Gosch taught special needs students at Juan Seguin Elementary School in Fort Bend County, Texas, but was fired earlier this year after reports of her behaviour were leaked.

In shocking emails obtained by the Houston Chronicle, Gosch’s alleged behaviour includes telling her students that they were all losers and telling her two aids to ‘accidentally’ hit them, as well as allowing the pupils to eat food that had fallen on the toilet.

It was the two aides who turned Gosch, 47, in to the Fort Bend Independent School District officials in January, the Chronicle reported.

Police launched an investigation into Gosch, who had never before come under scrutiny for her teaching methods.

The lawsuit is filed by two families whose children were allegedly victims of Gosch’s misconduct.

It also claims that the special needs students were allowed to eat food that had fallen on the floor of the bathroom, and make fun of students with disabilities.

The first family claims that their non-verbal and autistic 9-year-old daughter was placed in a filing cabinet.

The other alleges that their 9-year-old daughter was physically assaulted and had bits of her hair pulled out by Gosch.

The parents of the girl put in the filing cabinet allege that their daughter became increasingly claustrophobic at home and would begin exposing herself, according to the Chronicle.

The lawsuit says that the girl’s behaviours are all signs of sexual assault. 

The former teacher did not respond to calls made by MailOnline requesting comment.

Attorney Clint McGuire is representing the two families in the lawsuit, and told the Chronicle that their primary concern is that Gosch will no longer be able to teach.

He said that because of their condition, they could be easily preyed upon. He told the paper: ‘When you have kids that don’t speak for themselves, they become an easy target.’

According to state records, Gosch was certified to teach music from Kindergarten to 12th grade, as well as generic special education.

The Texas website notes that she is ‘currently under review by the SBEC Professional Discipline Unit.’

It is unclear how much compensation the two families are seeking, but they are asking compensation for damages including mental anguish, physical impairment, and out-of-pocket and medical expenses.
