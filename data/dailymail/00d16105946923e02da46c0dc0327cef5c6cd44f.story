Farmers and homeowners across country are spraying herbicides on milkweed plants - and in doing so, they're causing a massacre of the monarch butterfly.

When spraying the plant, they're destroying the iconic orange-and-black butterflies' nursery, food source and habitat, leaving millions homeless.

Since 1990, about 970million of the colorful creature have vanished - a 90 per cent decline in the species.

And in an attempt to counter years of destruction, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Wildlife Federation and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation have launched a partnership in hopes of growing milkweed and saving the monarchs.

Since 1990, about 970million monarch butterflies have vanished - a 90 per cent decline in the species. Species are dying out as their habitats are ruined by herbicides and climate change

About $2million of the $3.2million project will be used to restore more than 200,000 acres of milkweed (pictured) habitat from California to the Corn Belt

About $2million of the $3.2million project will be used to restore more than 200,000 acres of habitat from California to the Corn Belt. 

The restoration includes more than 750 schoolyard habitats and pollinator gardens, which could increase, or at least keep stagnant, the number of monarchs in the United States. 

Each winter, monarch butterflies travel thousands of miles from the United States and Canada to central Mexican forests. 

And in the spring, the insect makes the trek back. Because butterflies only live for four to five weeks, the trip requires six generations to complete.

Their food supply of milkweed - which is also their home across the United States - is decreasing. Farmers and homeowners are spraying herbicides, or weed killers, reducing the availability of the plant.

The monarchs spend their winters in Mexican mountain forests where climate is less extreme and they have a better chance of survival. But nearby human communities rely on the same forests for agriculture and tourist activities.   

Climate change disrupts the butterfly's annual migration pattern by affecting conditions in both winter grounds and summer breading grounds. 

While colder and wetter winters could be lethal to the insects, hotter and drier summers could shift habitats more north.

There are about 30million monarch butterflies remaining in the United States, according to the Washington Post.

Remaining money will be used to start a conservation fund that will provide grants to farmers and other landowners to conserve habitat.

The move by the Fish and Wildlife Service comes as it considers whether to classify the monarch butterfly as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, which would give the butterfly more protection.

'We can save the monarch butterfly in North America but only if we act quickly and together,' said Service Director Dan Ashe.

Monarch butterflies travel thousands of miles to Canada from Mexico each spring on a journey that requires six generations of the insect to complete.

On the journey, the insect - which only lives for four to five weeks - lays its eggs exclusively on the milkweed plant. 

Conversion of prairies into cropland and the increasing use of pesticide-resistant crops have greatly reduced milkweed, which is also an important food source, particularly in the heartland, according to a petition filed last August by environmental groups.

The conservation projects will be focused on the Interstate 35 corridor from Texas to Minnesota, in areas that provide important spring and summer habitats along the path for about 50 per cent of the migrating monarchs.

Fish and Wildlife Service is encouraging other federal and state agencies to join in on the project and preserve public land as well.

The group is working with governments in Canada and Mexico to help the iconic butterfly.

Yosemite National Park, too, offers protection for the milkweed plant. Cities across the United States have declared themselves sanctuaries for monarchs.

The groups heading the preservation project said the new announcement was a positive step, but the species needs legal protection.

Monarchs are pollinators and indicators of broader environmental problems.

'The specter of listing will spur a lot of conservation for the monarch,' said Tierra Curry, a senior scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the groups that asked the Fish and Wildlife Service last August to protect the monarch butterfly and set aside critical habitat.

But Curry said the butterfly needed to be listed for it to recover.

Other species of butterflies have faced extinction in the past, according to Fish and Wildlife Service.

The Xerces blue vanished from San Francisco sometime in the mid-1900s, and two subspecies - the rockland grass skipper and Zestos in Florida - haven't been seen since 2004.
