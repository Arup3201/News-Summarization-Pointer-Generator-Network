Ronald Koeman believes his Southampton players understand the club's decision to sell its top talents and has vowed to bring in replacements who are of equal quality or better than those who have left.

The Saints have already let striker Rickie Lambert and captain Adam Lallana join Liverpool while England left-back Luke Shaw was allowed to leave for Manchester United.

Deals for all three players had been agreed before Koeman took the job at St Mary's but the Dutchman insists the departures will not affect the morale of his squad.

'They know that's the story in football, players come and go,' Koeman said.

'The most important message I gave them was that we have to keep the philosophy and the ambition of the club.

'If
 we lose some players we will bring in players of the same quality or 
even better quality if that is possible. There is money to spend and to 
continue the quality and bring new players in.'

Koeman
 carries great pedigree as a player having played for Holland and 
Barcelona, for whom he scored the winning goal in the 1992 European Cup 
final.

The Dutchman's arrival on the south coast has been overshadowed, however, by constant transfer speculation.

Koeman admits it is important to convince the remaining players that Southampton is a club still moving forward.

'We did that from the first day we came into the dressing room,' Koeman said.

'That
 message is important because one thing is to say we are ambiitous, it 
is another thing to be ambitious and we need some more time in this 
pre-season to show that to the players.

'The
 rest of the players have to keep that ambition. I spoke to some of the 
more experienced players like Jose Fonte and Steven Davis because they 
have to keep that positivity in the dressing room.

'I promised them and I promise the fans that when we start the season we will have a very good team.'

The
 summer sales may not be over yet. Defender Dejan Lovren continues to be
 heavily linked with a move to Liverpool while midfielder Morgan 
Schneiderlin is also reported to be attracting interest from the likes 
of Tottenham and Arsenal.

Koeman
 is keen to hang on to the best players that remain and believes the 
board have adopted a tougher stance since selling Lambert, Lallana and 
Shaw.

'We said "Okay, this 
is it, we are not a selling club". The players have contracts. We don't 
sell any more players and we will try keep to that,' Koeman said.

'We
 sold three players - that's good enough. That's good enough money. Now 
we will keep the rest and we will continue with what we did last season.

'That's what came out of last year - a great season and they played wonderful games.

'I know Liverpool have a lot of money and they will spend that money and maybe they want to buy a player from Southampton.

But as manager of Southampton I have to do everything to keep those players. The final decision is with the board.'
