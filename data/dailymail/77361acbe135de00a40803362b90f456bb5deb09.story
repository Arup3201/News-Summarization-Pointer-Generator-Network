The Commons culture, media and sport select committee, chaired by Conservative MP John Whittingdale (above), is to publish its report on the future of the BBC

A parliamentary inquiry is to call for the BBC Trust to be scrapped, calling into question the future of the corporation’s governing body.

The Commons culture, media and sport select committee is expected to throw its weight behind calls for the organisation to be abolished.

The committee, chaired by Conservative MP John Whittingdale, is to publish its report on the future of the BBC, reportedly to be released within the next few weeks.

Its members are thought to be concerned over governance failures at the organisation and are largely in favour of replacing it with a board of directors, headed by a single chairman.

It has previously been attacked for its handling of the Jimmy Savile child abuse scandal, the pay offs by the BBC to its senior managers and the £100million of the corporation’s digital archive project. 

In 2009, former BBC director-general Greg Dyke called for it to be scrapped.

He branded it: ‘Unduly slow and bureaucratic, expensive to run and created inbuilt conflict.’

The move towards a board of directors, which was the system prior to the Trust, has also been previously floated.

Former BBC governor for Wales Sir Roger Jones, said in 2012 that the Trust’s existence was ‘crazy’, and added: ‘The BBC Trust should be scrapped as soon as possible and replaced by the former governance arrangements, in other words, go back to having governors.’

Ahead of publishing its investigation, the committee spent months last year hearing evidence on all aspects of the BBC and its governance, including from its director-general Tony Hall and representatives of the Trust itself. 

This delegation included Rona Fairhead, who took over as chair in October last year after Lord Patton of Barnes resigned following a heart attack.

The results of the inquiry are thought to opt for the board of directors model rather than alternatives, which have included transferring the Trust’s powers to Ofcom, which regulates other broadcasters.

It has also been reported that the politicians will back the continuation of the licence fee, although various other models, such as subscriptions have also been discussed in its sessions.

The Trust was set up in 2007 as a replacement for the previous board of governors, which was accused of not being tough enough in its approach to BBC regulation

The Trust has also had the same claim levelled against it and has faced harsh criticism from some of those giving evidence to the committee. 

Speaking in October, culture secretary Sajid Javid said the organisation had questions to answer over its governance and raised concerns over its effectiveness. 

A BBC Trust spokeswoman said: ‘We aren’t going to speculate about the contents of a future committee report. Governance will be debated at the time of charter review, along with a whole range of other issues and we will want to participate in that discussion.

‘We have been clear both that the BBC’s independence needs to be protected and that there must be strong oversight and regulation of the corporation in the interests of licence fee payers.’

Whittingdale declined to comment about the report and what its conclusions will be.
