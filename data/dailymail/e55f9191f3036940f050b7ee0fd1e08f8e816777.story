A 'monster nanny' was caught abusing a two-year-old girl when the child's parents secretly installed a video camera in their house.

The couple had become concerned about their child's aggressive behaviour, prompting them to set up the surveillance in their home outside Moscow.

They watched in terror as the childminder struck their daughter Sasha and threatened to push her face into a bowl of soup as she was being fed.

CCTV: A nanny, named as Larisa Zhulitskaya, 42, was pictured abusing two-year-old child Sasha after her parents set up a secret video camera

Aggressive: The parents, who live outside Moscow, posted a video of the abuse online, showing the nanny grabbing the child's head and slapping her

Threat: In the video Zhulitskaya can also be heard telling the two-year-old that she will force her face into a bowl of soup she is being fed

Denial: Larisa Zhulitskaya, a qualified teacher, responded by denying she routinely abused Sasha or other children in her care

The nanny is also pictured forcefully cleaning the girl's face after the meal, before pushing her away.

The middle-class Russian parents - who are not named but are known to have an older daughter studying in London - released an edited version of the footage as a warning to other parents.

They claimed video clips allegedly showing even worse abuse are in the hands of police.

'We have posted just one small clip, the worst is with the police and cannot be disclosed because of the investigation,' the couple wrote.

The parents name the nanny as Larisa Zhulitskaya, a qualified teacher, who responded by denying she routinely abused Sasha or other children in her care.

'That day I was simply in a foul mood,' claimed the 42-year-old. 'I had problems in my family, and I was in a really bad mood. But actually children adore me more than their own parents.'

The couple said that the nanny had worked for them for a year.

They stated: 'Larisa Zhulitskaya is two-faced monster. We thought that they exist only in the movies and horror stories and, of course, they do not look as cute as Larisa Zhulitskaya.'

Forceful: Images show the nanny, who said she was in a 'foul mood', grabbing the child's head in a forceful manner

Locked: The parents said the footage revealed that the nanny was sitting on the sofa, watching TV, while their child was locked in the kitchen

'But it turned out that this was a mistake as a monster turned to be among us. Do not trust her your children.'

They described the nanny as 'cheerful and responsive', and said she told them how Sasha 'spent time reading books' and playing happily.

The couple became suspicious when Sasha began to talk, saying they were surprised by her aggression towards toys.

When the couple set up the video camera they were 'horrified' to find Zhulitskayalying on the sofa watching TV all day, while their child was locked in the kitchen.

In one clip, the nanny scolds Sasha: 'Why do you stare into that bowl? What did you see there? Haven't seen food before? I told you not to lean over the bowl.'

She told the child: 'If you'll keep leaning to the bowl I'll put your face in that bowl.'

Push: After finishing feeding the child, the nanny forcefully pushes her out of her chair

Investigation: The couple said that the nanny had worked for them for a year and they had passed other videos to police

The helpless child is seen flinching as the nanny grabs her hair and says: 'There you are, now you are closer to the bowl.'

She yells at the child, telling her to 'close her mouth',  before striking her on the face.

But the nanny claimed that the child is 'very attached' to her and that she finds it 'easier to get along with her than her parents'.

She said that Sasha's father told her they had secretly filmed her before terminating her employment.

'I asked to see the video but I was told that they no longer want to see me and that I will have to communicate with the investigators,' she added.

The nanny's adult son Anton said: 'She is pretty rough with the girl. It is unusual behaviour for her, an emotional breakdown. But all this could have been discussed with my mother - she is a professional educator and a sane person.'

He attacked the parents for posting the video online. He said: 'They sent a letter to me, my girlfriend and her parents. In a letter written to my girlfriend's parents, they told them to think twice and asked if they were ready to have this woman to bring up their future grandchildren.

'But her former students speak about my mother very well.'
