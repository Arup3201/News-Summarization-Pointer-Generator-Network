At 92, the doughty Duke of Edinburgh is still fiercely independent.

Little wonder, then, that Philip recoiled in horror today when showed the latest form of transport for the fashionable pensioner about town.

The Queen’s husband, who has spent the summer recuperating in Scotland after abdominal surgery back in June, made clear on a visit to an old peoples’ home in Norfolk that he is not ready to take up a zimmer frame just yet.

What's this? The sprightly Prince Philip, who visited the St Michael's Care Complex in Aylsham, Norfolk, today, looks curiously at the walking frame

Not for him: The Prince - clearly not a fan of the walking frame - recoils in horror

Walking aids aside, Philip was clearly in high spirits as he toured the St Michael’s Care Complex in the market town of Aylsham, Norfolk.

At 92, he was older than many of its elderly residents, but still managed to show off his infamously sharp sense of humour when he joked about a toddler being knocked off an inflatable toy.

Philip made the aside as he was taken to an activity class and watched as a group of elderly women, sitting in a semi-circle, kicked large inflatable balls around the room at breakneck speed.

Meet and greet: Philip meets a resident - most of whom were younger than the 92-year-old Prince

All smiles: Philip showed off his quirky sense of humour during the trip - one of his first since taking two months leave following surgery

Standing in the doorway, the prince remarked: ‘This is dangerous’.

He then spotted 22-month-old Ella, whose great-grandmother Florence Crisp, 93, was taking part in the class, sitting on an inflatable ball and asked: ‘Do you get bonus points if you knock her off?’

Afterwards the prince turned to Elaine Stamp, manager of the residential block where the class was held and enquired: ‘Health and safety people?’. 

‘Health and safety goes out the window,’ she joked.

Fortunately,
said staff, all of those present took Philip’s remarks in their stride.

‘Everyone thought it was very funny and no-one was offended in the 
slightest. It was really quite funny,’ said one.

Activities assistant Bobbie Sauerzapf, 
who was leading the class, added: ‘This is gentle exercise to stimulate 
parts of the body that are not used too often, they really enjoy it.’

‘I think the Duke wanted to join in, to be honest. He looks brilliant for his age.’

During
his tour of the £4 million centre, which opened last November, the 
prince also watched residents playing indoor bowls and a performance by a
troupe of eye-catching young performers from the Broadland School of 
Dance.

Viewed by some as 'refreshingly open' but by others as somewhat politically incorrect, Prince Philip, pictured waving to the cameras today right, has always possessed a propensity to shock.

In 1986 he told British students in Peking: 'If you stay here much longer you'll all be slitty-eyed.'

Seven years later, he told a Briton living in Hungary: 'You can't have been here long. You've not got a pot belly.' His remarks apparently alluded to the Hungarians' love of food and drink.

Closer to home, he caused a storm while touring a factory in Edinburgh in August 1999 when he remarked that a fuse box 'looked as though it had been put in by an Indian'.

Again in Scotland, he outraged locals when he asked a driving instructor he met on a walkabout in Oban in 1995: ‘How do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to get them past the test?'.His other foot-in-mouth remarks include telling a group of teenagers from the British Deaf Association in Cardiff who were standing near a loud Caribbean steel band: 'If you're near that music it's no wonder you're deaf.'

Some of his off-the-cuff remarks have proved more amusing, however.

When asked if he knew the Scilly Isles, off the coast of Cornwall, he joked: ‘Yes, my son owns them.’

And of his daughter, Princess Anne, he jested: ‘If it doesn't fart or eat hay, she is not interested.'

But last year when Philip, pictured above signing portraits today, caused a bit of a stir on a Diamond Jubilee visit to Bromley in Kent with the Queen when he spotted pretty Hannah Jackson, 25, in an eye-catching peplum-style red dress which had a zip running the length of its front.

‘I would get arrested if I unzipped that dress!’ he exclaimed.

While Hannah, an LSE graduate who works for Bromley Council as a schools and transport co-ordinator, retained her composure, an unnamed policeman just fell about in a heap of giggles as the prince moved on.

Senior royal sources insist that the prince doesn’t mean to shock but has a mischievous sense of humour - which he likes to use to put people who might be nervous at meeting royalty at ease.

Before leaving, Philip officially opened the Green Lane View accommodation centre where the activities session was held.

And to mark the occasion, the 
residents had produced a printed cotton quilt of advice and sayings for 
the Duke to take for Prince George - wisdom from 2,399 accumulated years
of life.

A message to the 
royal baby from one resident, identified only by his first name Arthur, 
was ‘keep your nose clean’, while Pamela wrote ‘Find your own Way in 
life.’

The heartfelt words were accompanied 
by pictures the contributors liked, from countryside images to Second 
World War aircraft, reflecting the military service of some of the 
residents.

As Philip made 
his way to his car, he met residents from a nursing accommodation block 
who had been patiently waiting to greet him.

They were wrapped up in blankets as they sat in their wheelchairs and waved Union flags and red, white and blue balloons.

Present: Philip was given a quilt containing advice for Prince George from one of the female pensioners

Ted Sewell, 88, a former butcher, said
he supplied meat to Althorp House, the ancestral home of the Spencer 
family where Diana, Princess of Wales grew up.

He
said: ‘Philip looks just like he does on the telly. When I was butcher I
met William and Harry - they were always fighting each other.’

Philip was admitted to The London Clinic in early June – his fourth hospitalisation in just 18 months – where he underwent what Buckingham Palace described as an ‘exploratory operation following abdominal investigations’.

He was released 10 days later and although staff have refused to discuss the result of the tests citing medical confidentiality, they made clear he would require at least two months recuperation.

After retiring to recover at the Queen’s residences at Windsor Castle and Sandringham, Philip flew up to Scotland but now plans to embark on a full programme of public engagements of up to 300 engagements a year.
