A father-of-four claims he could have been decapitated when he crashed into a 'booby trap' while riding his dirt bike on a popular bush track.

Craig Billiet saw the barbed wired strung across the track between Little Creek and Emmerdale, north of Brisbane, Queensland, just in time as he was riding at speed on Tuesday at around 12pm.

Mr Billiet, 34, said the barbed wire was at neck height on the track and he saw it just in time to stick his arm up to protect himself.

'I'm lucky I saw it before it hit me and was able to put my arm up - it got the brunt of it, ' Mr Billiet told Daily Mail Australia.

Luckily, Mr Billiet noticed the wire and was able to put his arm up to protect his neck. His arm sustained most of the injuries 

While his arm sustained most of the injuries, Mr Billiet's neck also received severe lacerations from the barbed wire.

Mr Billiet is still in shock from the accident and said he rode that very track just two days before.

'I was in another world - all of a sudden I was holding my neck freaking out and thinking "what the hell just happened?"', he said.

Mr Billiet said he got straight back on his bike and rode home to his partner, Melanie, and four children.

Mr Billiet said the marks are slowly healing but he is still in pain. He said one mark could have had a few stitches

'Blood was gushing out - I was in quite a bit of pain', Mr Billiet said. 

'My partner was in shock to start with - she had a look at it and cleaned it up.

'There is one mark that probably could have got a couple of stitches.' 

The 34-year-old just bought his dirt bike but does not think he will be riding it any time soon.

'I am not keen at all to go for another ride at the moment,' he said. 

The incident has also prevented Mr Billiet from attending work. He runs his own business, Craig's Complete Couches and Upholstery Cleaning.

'I'm taking it slow - I'm going to try to do a bit of work today - I'm still in pain.' 

Mr Billiet reported the incident to local police in Gladstone and said he hopes they are able to find the person/s involved.

'I don't know who would do something like this - it has left me in shock.'  

Mr Billiet only just bought his dirt bike but said he will not be riding it any time soon
