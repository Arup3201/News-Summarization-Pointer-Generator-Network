A businesswoman who was distraught at the death of her son was defrauded out of thousands of pounds by a close friend.

Marion Kyte turned to her 'trusted friend' Claire Phillips to run her beauty salon after her ex-soldier son Gavin was found hanged at the family home.

But just a week after Phillips was seen weeping at the young man's funeral, she had started to steal money from the grieving mother and even hid her post in an attempt to cover up the fraud.

'What she did to me was the cruellest thing ever,' Mrs Kyte, 58, told Mold Crown Court last week.

'When Gavin died my whole life exploded and the world that I knew disintegrated - the grief is incomprehensible. Claire supported me after Gavin's death and she came to his funeral and cried.

'Three weeks after Gavin died and just a week after she had been at my son's funeral and cried, she started the deceit.'

Mrs Kyte, owner of the Face It salon in Mold, North Wales, had known Phillips, 39, for a decade and employed her at her business.

When she decided to give up the shop after her son's death at the age of 33 in November 2011, she agreed to entrust it to Phillips.

They agreed that the younger woman would take over on an informal basis, and would pay Mrs Kyte £70,000 over four years in return for ownership of the business.

But Phillips immediately started taking advantage of her friend, the court heard, and used Mrs Kyte's credit card to pay for £3,000 worth of expenses for the salon with which she was no longer involved.

When the bereaved mother paid £6,000 in rent for the property, Phillips' cheque to repay her bounced.

Mrs Kyte's bank statements and other pieces of mail had been hidden behind a toilet in order to avoid her discovering the fraud.

The defendant initially denied cheating her friend, but later changed her plea to guilty and was convicted of three charges of fraud and one of theft.

She was given a 12-month community order, told to carry out 240 hours of unpaid work and electronically tagged for three months.

Phillips must also give her former boss £3,335 compensation, which will take her more than four years to pay off at £15 a week.

Agony: Mrs Kyte said that her son's death was 'the worst time of my life' and the fraud made it even worse

Mrs Kyte, a grandmother, said that the betrayal had deeply wounded her.

'As a friend I gave her the most amazing deal to take over a hugely successful business,' she said.

'She had a young family and she could make a great business for herself and have the rewards from it. But when Gavin died she thought about what she would do and targeted me from then on.

'I had done so much to help Claire but right from the word go I was the target. She deceived me at my most vulnerable.'

The court heard that Mrs Kyte and her husband Neil, a retired police inspector, found Gavin hanged at their home in the village of Pentrecelyn.

An inquest later recorded an open verdict on his death after a coroner said he could not be sure the father of three intended to take his own life.

'It was the worst time of my life,' Mrs Kyte said. 'I wanted to die myself. It was terrible. He was my son and I loved him so much.

'He was my world, everything that I knew was safe just exploded.'
