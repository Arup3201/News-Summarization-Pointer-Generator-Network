Mr Wonderful: Hasnat Khan, the surgeon who stole Princess Diana's heart almost two decades ago pictured leaving his East London home yesterday

Walking out of his pebbledash house with his jacket over one arm, this man cuts a perfectly unremarkable figure.

In fact, he is Hasnat Khan, the surgeon who stole Princess Diana’s heart almost two decades ago – and could have been her second husband.

Nicknamed ‘Mr Wonderful’ by Diana, he was photographed yesterday ahead of the premiere tonight of a film which chronicles their two-year affair.

Friends say Diana wanted to marry dashing heart surgeon Mr Khan.

But their relationship ended in 1997, only a few weeks before her death.

Now 54, Mr Khan lives in East London and is based at Basildon University Hospital in Essex.

He was dressed casually as he left the house yesterday, in jeans and trainers, but was carrying a suit jacket.

It was a mundane scene far removed from the dashing young heart surgeon of the film - and what might have been.

Mr Khan has vowed he will never see the film, which he said was ‘completely wrong’ and based on ‘cruel lies’.

After seeing a poster for the movie, called Diana, he said: ‘I could tell immediately those were never our mannerisms at all.

'You could just tell from that picture that it is all just presumed about how we would behave with each other, and they have got it completely wrong.

‘There wasn’t any hierarchy in our relationship. She wasn’t a princess and I wasn’t a doctor.

‘We were friends, and normal people stand like friends with each other.’

The film makers tried repeatedly to win Dr Khan’s cooperation and support for the movie, but he said: ‘I haven’t spoken to anyone involved in that movie. I have never given my approval for it.’

He said he could not imagine what the 
film was based on, given that he had never told anyone, not even close 
friends, details of his closeness to Diana.

Mr Khan, who is single after an arranged marriage ended in divorce, made the comments in the Mail on Sunday.

He added: ‘There are a hundred could-have-beens.

‘She [Diana] could be living very happily and married and having more kids, with me or with someone else.

‘It could have led in that direction. I try not to think about these things. I can’t change anything now.’

Screen version: Naomi Watts as Diana and Naveen Andrews as Hasnat Khan in the new film chronicling the pair's romance

Chronicle: Naomi Watts as Princess Diana in the new film

The film, which stars Naomi Watts as 
Diana and Naveen Andrews as Mr Khan, is based on Kate Snell’s 2001 book 
Diana: Her Last Love.

It
suggests that Diana was seeing Dodi Fayed, who died with her in a car 
crash in Paris in September 1997, to make Mr Khan jealous.

The Princess is shown deploying celebrity photographer Jason Fraser and using Dodi as a pawn to make the heart surgeon jealous.

Actress Naomi Watts said she had studied Diana carefully in preparation for her screen role.

She said: ‘He (Dr Khan) was someone she trusted right away. She was fascinated by his mind. He was clever and traditional.

‘She
knew he was never going to exploit her. She did end up finding a 
connection with this one man. And I think that, despite the tragedy, 
that’s an uplifting story.’
