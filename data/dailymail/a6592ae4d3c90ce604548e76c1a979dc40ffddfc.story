The pair grab the table before they casually leave the Arena Park Shopping Centre store together - just 55 seconds after they first entered

Amazingly,  members of staff did not spot the suspected thieves who struck under their noses on the afternoon of October 9

During the clip, the man, wearing a dark jacket and flat cap, can be seen taking the time to remove photo frames from the top of the piece of furniture.

Meanwhile, his partner - dressed in a dark grey hoodie - is scouring the store putting items into her bag.

She then returns to grab the other end of the table before they casually leave the Arena Park Shopping Centre store together - just 55 seconds after they first entered.
