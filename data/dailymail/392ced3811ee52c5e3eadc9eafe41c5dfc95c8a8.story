Using only black and white paint, Valeriya Kutsan's stunning designs prove that face painting is not always about novelty animals and children's birthday parties.

The images are a collaboration between the artist and photographer Alexander Khokhlov, who named the series Weird Beauty.

Make-up artist Kutsan creates the distinctive designs by first coating a model's face with white paint before applying layers of black paint.

The images showcase both the artist's eye for a unique design and her ability to interpret recognisable symbols.

The collection features her take on Mickey Mouse, fashion brand Chanel's logo and the recycling symbol often found on household goods.

Katsun's
fascination with everyday symbolism runs through the designs, which 
also feature a heart monitor reading, a circuit board design and an 
eight-ball.

Her array of designs also includes a corset 
that appears to be tightened around the model's face, a keyhole that a
model is peering through and a huge Quick Response code.

The duo has sold three 3.9 ft long 
prints for up to 800 pounds each at an exhibition and are now selling 
copies of the pictures through a gallery and 
online.

Russian photographer Alexander Khokhlov, 28, said: 'Valeriya Kutsan, the make-up artist, and I wanted to make 
different monochromatic face arts for the new year calendar.

'Each new photo showed us that it was more than good paintings. I saw the double bottom in the images
and was impressed by the way that simple forms and real human faces can
collaborate to each other.

'It was simultaneously simple, 
stylish, illusionary effective and weird, so I decided to name the 
project ‘Weird Beauty’ after the first letters of ‘white’ and ‘black’.

He added: 'For the project me and 
Valeriya selected more than 30 ideas, we wanted to create characters 
such as yin yang or a chess board.

'The possible combinations of black and white were different and mostly unexpected.

'Some ideas were invented in the course of the project, we always find something new.'
