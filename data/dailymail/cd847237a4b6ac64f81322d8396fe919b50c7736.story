England's Ravi Bopara has called for greater education of county players following the latest allegations of corruption to hit the domestic game.

Three county matches are being investigated by the International Cricket Council’s anti-corruption unit as part of a wide-ranging probe based on evidence from former New Zealand batsman Lou Vincent.

They are looking at two games from Vincent’s time at Sussex in 2011 — a T20 and a 40-over contest — plus another T20 he played for Lancashire in 2008.

The revelations overshadowed the much-publicised launch of the revamped domestic T20 tournament, the NatWest Blast.

Bopara has painful memories of the last major scandal to rock English county cricket, when Essex team-mates Mervyn Westfield and Danish Kaneria were found guilty of spot-fixing during a limited-overs match against Durham in 2009.

He said: ‘Nobody wants this, it’s a beautiful game. The last thing we want to do is put fans off. We want to keep this game as clean as possible and keep the fans enjoying it. It’s a horrible place to be when the fans are questioning everything.’

Several Essex players heard Kaneria talking about fixing in the dressing room during his time at the club but discounted it as ‘banter’.

Now Bopara has urged cricket’s authorities to step up their anti-corruption education programmes to ensure similar incidents do not occur in the future.

‘I certainly know what to do,’ he said. ‘I’ve been briefed quite a bit with England.

‘I think it could be drummed into county cricket a bit more just how important it actually is to report it if something is dodgy. You have to report it— that’s key.’

Bopara also backed calls from England team-mate Ian Bell to ban communication devices from dressing rooms during televised county games.

The practice is standard for international fixtures and Bopara, speaking after Essex’s eight-wicket victory against Middlesex in the first match of a T20 double-header at Lord’s, said: ‘You don’t need to speak to anyone for half a day. If that’s what it’s going to take to keep it clean, then let’s do it.’
