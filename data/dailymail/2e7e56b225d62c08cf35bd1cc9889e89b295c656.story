I just cannot understand why Ian Ritchie has made such a statement.

The first thing that surprises me is the timing, following one of the most exciting days ever in Five and Six Nations history. England’s victory over France was brilliant to watch, even if they did fall just short of winning the title. 

Twickenham was rocking and it was an amazing advert for the game ahead of a home World Cup. I’m in Switzerland at present and on the flight the pilot, air stewardesses and all the passengers were talking about Saturday and their real optimism for the World Cup. So for Ritchie to say finishing second is unacceptable just flattens the mood. It doesn’t seem right and is a massive own goal.

More importantly, his words undermine Stuart Lancaster. I would go as far as to say he has belittled much of the progress that Lancaster and the team have achieved. If this had happened to me, I would be in Ritchie’s office demanding an explanation. 

This is professional sport and being a head coach is a tough position. The moment someone says something, the opposition see a chink, a weakness, and try to drive a wedge through it. It’s one thing to say these things in private, as professional sport is about winning, but to say them in public is wrong.

If Lancaster has called the result unacceptable, fair enough, but Ritchie has no qualifications to talk about the team’s performance. This year is all about preparing for the World Cup and England put 55 points and seven tries on the board in style. 

The atmosphere at Twickenham for England's final Six Nations match was electric from start to finish 

This was the time for a pat on the back and a united front. Ian Ritchie appointed Stuart Lancaster after an interim period, which was a brave decision when he had the opportunity to put in far more experienced coaches. 

He appointed an inexperienced coach in Lancaster yet later awarded him a six-year contract. If the priority was short-term gains, he should have been given a one-year contract.

Coming in with no international coaching experience, Lancaster has done a very good job. Wales and Ireland are very strong teams too so to think you can just win Grand Slams and championships is very naive and just brings back the tag that the English are arrogant.

I’m sure Ritchie had good intentions, perhaps wanting to be seen to be saying the right thing after another title miss. But he will regret what he said as England are in a very good position.

If England are going to win the World Cup, they have to have everybody together as one team, everybody’s noses pointing in the same direction from the chief executive down to the water boys.

We should all be feeling positive after such a brilliant display against France and looking forward to the World Cup. It’s all positive.
