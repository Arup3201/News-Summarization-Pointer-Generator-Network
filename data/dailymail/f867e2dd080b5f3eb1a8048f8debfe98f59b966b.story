It's renowned for its cheap flights and no-frills service.

But budget airline Ryanair has announced it is set to launch its own package holiday brand.

The move, which follows in the footsteps of rival carrier easyJet, could happen within five years, according to Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair's chief marketing officer.

Ryanair has already planned to merge its flights and add-ons to create a package holiday

Mr Jacobs revealed that the Irish airline - which has been on a charm offensive in a bid to change its image - could merge its existing holiday add-ons, such as car hire and hotels, into an over-arching low-cost holiday brand.

Mr Jacobs told trade paper Travel Trade Gazette: 'If it becomes Ryanair Holidays at a point in time, it is a logical way for the brand to go.

'We do a version of it already. We can certainly do it better than we do. The way customers are responding to the new improved Ryanair, I think it will go forward.'

Mr Jacobs added: 'I can see us launching this in the next five years. People will say you will not have been able to do that with the old Ryanair.'

Rival budget airline easyJet made a similar move in 2011, launching its own easyJet Holidays brand.

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has made key changes to the business after it was the worst for customer service of 100 brands in Which? magazine

That initially paired cheap flights with hotel bookings, but has since expanded to become a wider tour operator, offering city, ski and beach breaks. Golf and cycling holidays are set to follow from this year.

Mr Jacobs became Ryanair's first chief marketing officer at the beginning of the year, after the airline was voted worst of 100 brands for customer service in Which? magazine in 2013.

However, boss Michael O'Leary has since gone a charm offensive cutting the much-hated costs of luggage and other 'extras'.

Recently the airline's financial situation has improved, with the company reporting a 152 per cent year-on-year rise in profits to 156m for the three months ending 30 June.

Ryanair also launched a business class in September, offering flexible booking and priority boarding.
