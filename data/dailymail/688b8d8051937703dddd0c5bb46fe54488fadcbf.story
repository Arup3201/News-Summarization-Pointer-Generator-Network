She's used to jumping in puddles, going to playgroup and playing with her little brother George.

So it might come as some surprise that Peppa Pig is the latest British traveller to be detained at customs.

The children’s TV character was set to be
 one of the headline acts at the Priory Park Playgroup’s Summer Fair in 
Cambridge.

Ham-fisted: Peppa Pig seen here  playing with her brother George

So fundraising manager Kelly Holmes bought a Peppa Pig costume from China for £210 
pounds.

But it was confiscated and destroyed upon arrival in 
the UK because it was thought to violate intellectual property rights.

Ms Holmes, 35, said: 'I thought I’d probably have to dress up and a few of us were going to take it in turns but we needed a costume so I bought one on eBay,'

'It said official Peppa Pig and it was more expensive than the others. It said it was available in the UK and it had good ratings.

'The border force wrote to me saying Peppa Pig’s been detained at customs” she told Cambridge News.

'They confirmed it should be destroyed. Obviously I was very upset for the children. We’d already advertised that Peppa Pig was coming.'

Ms Holmes said she hopes to get a refund from the seller through eBay after raising the issue, but her main focus is the Summer Fair.'We’re hoping Peppa can still be there in some form and if not then another mascot,' she said.
