Sir David Attenborough was admitted to hospital for urgent heart surgery yesterday.

The 87-year-old naturalist was fitted with a pacemaker, which is normally used to correct an abnormal heartbeat.

Doctors were said to be satisfied with his progress, although he was forced to cancel a sold-out speaking tour of Australia, due to start next week.

A spokesman said his cardiologist had
told him he needed a pacemaker fitted urgently and added: ‘Obviously 
after that you can’t take a long-haul flight.’

The BBC released a brief statement 
from director of television Danny Cohen saying: ‘We all wish Sir David a
full and strong recovery.’

Although he is thought not to have a 
history of heart problems, Sir David suffers from high blood pressure, 
which can increase the danger of heart attacks and strokes.

Tour: Sir David, 87, had been due to embark on a sold-out tour of Australia next week, which has been cancelled in light of his health issue

Last year his film director brother 
Richard, 89, was admitted to a care home for retired actors after being 
confined to a wheelchair by a stroke.

Their younger brother John, 83, a retired motor industry executive, died in November from a degenerative brain condition. 

Pacemaker implantation involves inserting a small battery-operated device into a patient's chest, which emits regular electrical pulses that help to keep the heart beating regularly.

The contractions of the heart muscle that pump blood around the body are triggered by electrical pulses. Should those natural pulses be disrupted for any reason, resulting in an abnormal heartbeat or arrhythmia, a pacemaker may be fitted.

Common causes of arrhythmia include sick sinus syndrome, where the heart beats abnormally slowly, atrial fibrillation, where it beats abnormally fast, or a heart block, where the pulse that triggers the contraction of the heart muscle is either delayed or absent.Sir David is having a pacemaker implanted today

The small metal box is attached to one or more wires - or pacing leads - that run to the heart. It contains a battery, pulse generator and tiny computer circuit that converts energy from the battery into electrical impulses which then flow down the wires and stimulate the heart to contract.

The relatively straightforward implantation process is carried out under local anaesthetic, meaning the patient is awake throughout the procedure.

Typically the generator is inserted beneath the skin near the collarbone, and attached to a wire that is guided through a blood vessel to the heart.

The procedure, which usually lasts between 30 and 60 minutes, is one of the most common types of heart surgery, and most people are well enough to leave hospital the day after the surgery.

Sir David, whose 60-year BBC career 
included a stint as controller of BBC2, was due to speak about his life 
and work in Brisbane on June 11. The tour also included events in 
Canberra, Perth, Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne.

The Australian promoter, Lateral 
Event Management, said it had been cancelled ‘with regret’, adding: ‘Sir
David expressed his extreme disappointment as he said he was very much 
looking forward to coming back  to Australia and he hopes to reschedule 
his tour in the near future.’

A pacemaker is a small, 
battery-operated device inserted into the  patient’s chest. It emits 
regular electrical pulses to keep the heart beating regularly.

The implantation process usually 
lasts under an hour and is carried out under local anaesthetic. Most 
patients are well enough to leave hospital the day after the surgery.

Sir David, whose programmes include 
Life on Earth and The Living Planet, had a knee replacement last year 
and often walks with the aid of sticks. Yet he has not let his advancing
years and infirmity get in the way of his work or love of travel.

He recently narrated the hit BBC1 
series Africa and presented a Sky 3D documentary on the Galapagos 
Islands and a new BBC Radio 4 series, Tweet Of The Day, devoted to 
birdsong.

Asked about his plans earlier this 
year, he said: ‘I’m going to China to see some very interesting fossils.
In 2012 I went to the Galapagos, Africa, North America and Australia. 
I’ve no idea how many days I was away.’

He added: ‘I’ve been broadcasting for 60 years. I don’t want to slow down. Retirement would be so boring.’

Sir David was knighted in 1985 and has also won a Royal Television Society Lifetime Achievement Award.

On becoming a patron of the Blood 
Pressure Association in 2005, he said: ‘It is a tragedy that so many 
people suffer from strokes and heart attacks because they have no idea 
they have high blood pressure.’
