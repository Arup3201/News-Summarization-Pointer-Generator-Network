Liverpool's owners insist Brendan Rodgers' position is not even up for discussion as he seeks to get their dreadful season on an even keel.

The manager admitted his job would be on the line after his side crashed to their fourth consecutive defeat at Crystal Palace on Sunday and that he was 'not arrogant enough' to think he was safe regardless.

But as he prepares to take Liverpool to Bulgaria for their vital Champions League clash with Ludogorets, there is not even the slightest suggestion that Fenway Sports Group, the club's American owners, are contemplating making a change.

They backed Rodgers in the summer when giving him a new four-year contract after he had guided Liverpool to within two points of winning the title and showed their support by giving him £116million to re-shape the squad following the sale of Luis Suarez.

Rodgers frequently says he has 'good communication' with FSG's main men - John W Henry, Tom Werner and Mike Gordon - and FSG remain convinced last season's Manager of the Year is the man to take Liverpool forward for the long-term.

Speaking after his side's 3-1 defeat at Selhurst Park on Sunday, Rodgers said: 'Any manager will tell you that you have to win games and get results, particularly after the way we have been developing as a club. 

'I have great communication with the owners. We've been honest enough with each other and we have to get results.

'You have to perform. Owners and directors and chairmen have to see development on the field.

Three straight league defeats, and no points in November, have left Liverpool in real trouble in the league

'Barring this period, our development has been very good and fast. But there's no doubt you have to get results.

'That will support the confidence to the owners, and you take it from there. I will only ever do my best.

'The best has seen us develop well. Now I must fight even harder. The full responsibility comes down to me.

'Now I have to fight even harder and take the responsibility. As manager, the responsibility comes down to me and any pressure comes on to me.'
