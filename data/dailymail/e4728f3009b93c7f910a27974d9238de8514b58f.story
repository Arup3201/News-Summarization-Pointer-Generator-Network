A heroic cat could win an award after rescuing his five-year-old owner from bullies who pushed him to the ground as he played with his younger brother.

The moggy named Smudge pounced on the chest of one of the boys after he saw frightened Ethan Fenton being pushed to the ground outside his home in Doncaster.

The boy and his friends were so shocked by the tabby cat’s actions that they ran away crying leaving Ethan and his two-year-old brother Ashton alone.

Mother Sharon Fenton, 26, who witnessed the attack said: ‘I was keeping an eye on the boys who were playing football in the front garden.

‘I saw three boys who were much taller and older than Ethan walk over to our front gate.

‘I heard them shout Ethan’s name twice but he ignored them and just put his head back down and kept playing with Ashton.

‘But then they shouted him again and then one of the boys got in Ethan’s face and said “Oi! Why are you ignoring me?” and pushed him over.

‘That’s when I rushed outside and saw Smudge fly out from under our car and jump on the boy’s chest.

‘I think it was shock more than anything but the boy stumbled backwards, burst into tears and then ran off.'

Miss Fenton, who is a part time hairdresser, bought Smudge after being left heartbroken when the cat they had for just 18 months died.

The cat they had originally picked out was sold before they were able to pick it up and so found ginger and white moggy Smudge when he was 10-weeks-old.

‘When they showed us Smudge it was just love at first sight,' she said.

‘He was so small and cute and I knew we just had to have him.’

The family, who are from Doncaster, have had Smudge for three years but had never before seen his heroic alter ego.

Proud Miss Fenton added: ‘He has never done anything like that before but it was absolutely brilliant seeing him look out for Ethan like that.

‘He has slept outside his bedroom keeping guard ever since it happened.

‘I actually feel so much safer knowing Smudge is around after seeing him defend him like that.

‘He is a big part of the family and he is more of a brother to the boys than a cat.’

Smudge has now been nominated for a National Cat of the Year award set up by the Cats Protection charity.

The family will find out if he has taken the top spot in his ‘heroic cat’ category at an awards ceremony in The Savoy Hotel in London next month.
