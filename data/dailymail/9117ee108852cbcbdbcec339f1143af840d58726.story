Dundee United manager Jackie McNamara has warned that Stuart Armstrong will only be allowed to leave Tannadice for serious money.

The powerful midfielder scored what turned out to be the winner in Sunday's 2-1 home victory over Celtic who — as revealed by Sportsmail earlier this month — have reignited their interest in adding him to the Parkhead squad.

But McNamara, experiencing his first win over his former club as United manager, said: ‘We would want the going rate. We don’t need to sell, we’re debt free, everything is good.

‘If the right offer came in, I’m sure the chairman and the rest of the board would look at it. But the most important thing is to keep them here, let them progress and learn.

‘We would like to have done that with Andrew (Robertson) and Ryan (Gauld) in the summer — but there comes a point when it is too good to turn down, not just for the club but for the kids themselves. Of course, silly money changes everything.

‘It was the same in the summer with Andrew Robertson. You don’t want to sell him — but there comes a point when you have to accept it.

‘Every team in Scotland is a selling club. Celtic is a selling club, so you could try to sell some of their players for the next few weeks.

‘Speculation has been part of it since I came here. And it will be until the end of January when the window closes.

‘I’m hopeful I will still have the same squad, maybe one or two players coming in, instead of going out.

‘It is a compliment to the players, it is always nice for them to be linked (with other clubs).

‘But, for the manager, it doesn’t help. Last year, it wasn’t one or two, it was six or seven.

‘And we lost a couple mentally for a few weeks because of that. We sent Ryan Gauld and John Souttar away on holiday. Because of that, they took a little dip (in form).

‘Armstrong was linked, Nadir Ciftci was linked, Gary Mackay-Steven was linked.

‘Hopefully, it is not as many this year — and there were no signs of losing focus against Celtic today.

‘No doubt, as we get closer to the transfer window, everybody will be linked with somebody.’

McNamara heaped praise on his team for getting the job done at Tannadice, singling out Ciftci — who was booked inside the opening minute, scored the opener and then provided a brilliant assist for Armstrong’s goal — as a player worth all the effort to curb his volatile temper.

‘When Nadir is on it, he is a handful. Not just his goal but his set-up play for Stuart to score as well.’ said McNamara, whose team were made to sweat by Leigh Griffiths’ late counter for Celtic.

The striker, who came on as a 78th-minute substitute for Nir Bitton, also saw another effort bounce back off the post, whilst what appeared to be a perfectly good goal from Celtic’s Stefan Scepovic was ruled out for offside.

McNamara added: ‘We have said all along Nadir is a fantastic problem, who has taken a lot of hard work behind the scenes.

‘When he got booked after 30 seconds, that is part of it! But I have said all along that he is worth the hassle at times because of what he can give to the team, the ability he has.’

Armstrong also lived up to his pre-match billing, Celtic manager Ronny Deila having described him as a ‘Thomas Muller type’, player who can cause damage to any opposition.

His winner will have done little to lower the Norwegian’s opinion of him.

The question is whether Deila will have been impressed enough to pay a hefty transfer fee for a really promising footballer who has 18 months left on his Tannadice contract.

‘It’s a compliment more than anything,’ said the 22-year-old of the continued interest, adding: ‘It gives you a bit of confidence and it is nice to hear of interest there. It helps in your game for Dundee United.

‘Everyone has dreams and ambitions but I like to focus on where I am at the moment and doing my best.

‘I didn’t see that Muller comparison. It is quite a compliment. He is a World Cup winner — and not a bad player!

‘Yes, it’s nice to hear him paying those kind of compliments. It wasn’t in my head today.

‘I always enjoy playing against Celtic. They are a good team, they pass the ball really well and it’s good to compare yourself with the best quality in the country. Everyone put on a good show today.’

Meanwhile, McNamara insisted his team, who move into second place in the table, should not be considered title contenders, arguing: ‘It is still too early to say that. We have to be more consistent.’
