The death toll from a horrific tour bus crash has risen from five to nine after the vehicle slid off an icy interstate in Oregon before tumbling over a steep embankment near an area known as Deadman Pass.

Police say the bus lost control along snow and ice-covered lanes on Interstate 84 causing it to crash through a guardrail in eastern Oregon around 10.30am this morning injuring more than 20 others.

The bus carrying about 40 people from Las Vegas to Vancouver, B.C. fell about a few hundred feet before finally coming to a stop according to state police.

Emergency rescue: Emergency workers rushed to a frightening wreckage that left nine people dead after their tour bus crashed in Eastern Oregon injuring 26 others on Sunday morning

Destination: Oregon police say the tour bus was heading to Vancouver from Las Vegas when it lost control on the slippery interstate

Tragedy: By Sunday evening the death toll from this grisly wreckage had risen from five to nine people with the bus driver among the 26 others injured

Deadly slide: The tour bus careened through a guardrail along an icy Oregon highway before falling several hundred feet down this steep embankment

All of the last 'viable victims' have since been removed from the bus, according to Pendleton Fire Chief Gary Woodson speaking to East Oregonian.

Rescue workers were using ropes to help retrieve people from the crash scene.

St. Anthony Hospital in Pendleton treated
 26 people from the accident, including some who were treated and then 
transported to other medical facilities, said hospital spokesman Larry 
Blanc.

The bus driver was among the survivors, but had not yet spoken to police because of the severity of the injuries the driver had suffered.

Lt. Greg Hastings said the bus crashed along the west end of the Blue Mountains, and west of an area called Deadman Pass. Stretches of highway in the rural and agricultural area of east Oregon tend to be icy in winter months.

The bus slid down the hill and landed upright, with little or no debris visible around the crash site.

Escape: Survivors were pulled up to the roadside by ropes before at least 26 of them transferred to a local hospital

Crash scene: Police say the bus lost control along snow and ice-covered lanes on Interstate 84 nearly Pendleton causing it to crash through a guardrail in eastern Oregon around 10.30am this morning

Deadly conditions: The fatal crash was the second seen on Interstate 84 pictured on Sunday morning with a 69-year-old man killed in a rollover accident earlier in the day

I-84 is a major east-west highway through Oregon that follows the Columbia River Gorge.

Umatilla County Emergency Manager Jack Remillard said the bus was owned by Mi Joo travel in Vancouver, B.C.

A woman who answered the phone at a listing for the company confirmed with The Associated Press that it owned the bus and said it was on a tour of the Western U.S. She declined to give her name.

A bus safety website run by the U.S. Department of Transportation said Mi Joo Tour & Travel has six buses, none of which have been involved in any accidents in at least the past two years.

First responders: Rescue personnel respond to the scene on I-84, east of Pendleton, where rope was used to help bring up survivors

Dramatic fall: The green tour bus is just seen on the right after sliding down the embankment after its crash off the interstate

Treacherous: The frozen winter conditions throughout the area made the roads incredibly slippery to drivers, with another fatal crash seen along the interstate earlier that morning

A spokesman for the American Bus Association said buses carry more than 700 million passengers a year in the United States.

'The industry as a whole is a very safe industry,' said Dan Ronan of the Washington, D.C.,-based group. 'There are only a handful of accidents every year. Comparatively speaking, we're the safest form of surface transportation.'

The bus crash was the second fatal 
accident on I-84 in Oregon on Sunday morning due to icy conditions after
 a 69-year-old man died in a rollover accident.
