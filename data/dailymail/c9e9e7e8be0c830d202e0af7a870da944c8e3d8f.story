From creating smart devices that can be operated with a phone, to retro games consoles - programmers and gadget enthusiasts can now get an even smaller slice of the Raspberry Pi microcomputer.

The British engineering foundation has unveiled its latest version, called the Raspberry Pi Model A+ - a super-slim, 2.5 inch-long (6.5cm) machine costing just £15.50 in the UK, and $20 in the US.

It’s described as a ‘small, energy-efficient and crazy-affordable’ way to get into computing, or to hack products and create new engineering projects for coders with more experience.

A British engineering foundation has unveiled its latest computer - the Raspberry Pi Model A+ (pictured) - a super-slim 2.5 inch (6.5cm) long machine costing just £15.50 in the UK and $20 in the US

Smaller than a credit card, the Model A+ has a 700Mhz processor and 256MB of RAM.

It weighs 0.8 ounces (23g) and has been designed for watching hi-definition video, programming, playing games and web browsing.

This is because the tiny Linux computer has a HDMI socket to connect to a monitor or TV.

Dimensions: 2.1-inch x 2.2-inch x 0.4-inches (6.5cm x 5.6cm x 1.2cm) at its thickest point.

Memory: 256MB RAM

Expansion: MicroSD slot, USB port, 40  pins

Weight: 8 ounces (23g) 

Price: £15.50 (UK) and $20 (US) 

Comparison with old Model A: Model A+ is 20 per cent cheaper, 24 per cent shorter and 42 per cent thinner

There is also an audio jack, room for a micro SD card and a USB socket to connect other devices.

The Model A+ is made by Raspberry Pi, a Cambridge-based charity, which launched its original cheap microcomputer in 2012. 

The microcomputer became a surprise hit and is now used in many schools in the UK to teach coding.

The Model A+ model is its cheapest and smallest yet.

James Adams, director of hardware engineering, said: ‘We want to get them into the hands of children so they can learn about computers and programming.

‘Parents might not want to let children play about on computers, but this gives them access to technology at an affordable price.

The Linux microcomputer (shown) is described as ‘small, energy-efficient and crazy-affordable’ way to get into computing or to hack products and create new engineering projects, for coders with more experience

‘It is cheap and flexible. It can be used as a desktop PC or for a robot. It is a bit like digital Lego.’

Raspberry Pi recently revamped its more powerful Model B board to a B+ with extra features, for the same $35 (£24) price tag.

The engineers said the new Model A+ ‘inherits many improvements that we made to the Model B+’.

The small microcomputer is $5 (£3.15) cheaper than the Model A, which the foundation describes as ‘pretty mind-bending’.

In an interview with Linux Voice,  founder Eben Upton revealed that Google’s Eric Schmidt is responsible for the firm pushing for cheaper prices, because he said: ‘try and be as cheap as possible...try and get as close to free as you can.’

Google gave the Foundation $1 million (£630,000) last year to put 15,000 Raspberry Pis in UK schools in a bid to help children learn to code. 

The world's first 3D printed laptop, called Pi-Top (pictured) powered by a Raspberry Pi, has raised more than one-and-a-half times its funding target on Indiegogo

The world's first 3D printed laptop, powered by a Raspberry Pi, has raised more than one-and-a-half times its funding target on Indiegogo. 

The Pi-Top was designed to teach people how to build 3D printed circuits and hardware.

Its case can be printed on a 3D printer, or the £180 kit includes a moulded case.

It also features a Raspberry Pi board, and instructions on how to create the DIY laptop. 

The campaign page said the 'learning experience will take you to a stage where you are designing your own components and products.'

It ends on 13 November and has raised more than $129,970 (£81,900) of its $80,000 (£50,400) target.
