A French mayor caught speeding at almost twice the legal limit told police he trying to dry his car out after a visit to the car wash.

Jean-Louis Hennon’s excuse is considered one of the most bizarre ever offered for breaking the law.

After being caught by a flash gun doing more than 100mph in a 55mph zone, the mayor of Courcelles-Epayelles, in the Oise department of northern France, said he had just left a service station.

Excuses: A French mayor caught driving at almost twice the speed limit told officers he was 'drying his car' (file picture)

Mr Hennon said: ‘I’d been to the car wash and on the way back I may have accelerated for around a kilometre, no more, to dry the car out.

'It may seem strange a strange excuse but it is a sincere one.’

The incident is particularly embarrassing for Mr Hennon because it comes just a few days before municipal elections on Sunday, when he could lose his job.

Today he was insisting that he was ‘not above the law’, while police were preparing to prosecute him for Saturday’s speeding.

Mr Hennon said: ‘I drove a little fast for 1 kilometre, 1.5 kilometres maybe. Certainly I was going too fast.

‘Okay, well, I got caught by the police. I told them I agreed with them, that what I did was not very good, and that I made a mistake.

'I recognised my stupidity. I made a mistake and I won’t do it again.’

Mr Hennon was caught at 10.15am on the D138 road between Maignelay-Montigny, not far from Amiens in northern France, and Tricot.

Police regularly highlight strange excuses people offered for speeding too fast on public roads.

They range from drives saying they saw red and blue lights in their rear view mirror, to those who say they were engrossed in a conversation with a passenger so did not notice the speedometer.

In 2008 a Muslim businessman from Falkirk, Stirlingshire, who was caught breaking the speed limit managed to keep his licence after saying he was ‘commuting’ between his two wives.

In 1999, the then England footballer David Beckham successfully appealed against an eight-month driving ban for speeding in his Ferrari Maranello after he claimed he had been speeding to escape a chasing photographer.

And, in the same year, Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson was found not guilty of illegally driving on a motorway hard shoulder after magistrates heard he had been suffering from severe diarrhoea and was trying to get to a toilet.
