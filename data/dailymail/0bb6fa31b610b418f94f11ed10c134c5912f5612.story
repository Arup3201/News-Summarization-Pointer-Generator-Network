It is the IMAX for the home, a super slim television with a screen that can be curved according to the dimensions of the room and where people are sitting.

The flatscreen TV is already becoming tech-history as manufacturers launch curved screens that can sit in the corner and give everyone a good view.

But now Samsung has gone one further with a flexible, bendable TV screen where the viewer can set the level of the curve using a remote control.

The South Korean company, which is the world’s largest TV manufacturer, showcased an 85inch prototype among a host of new devices at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.

Rival manufacturer, LG, has also announced a smaller 77in flexible TV of its own that is based on OLED (organic light-emitting diode) technology.

The flexible screens will eventually join a new generation of large and expensive ultra high definition(UHD) TV sets – also known as 4K .

The sets boast astonishing picture clarity, likened to looking through a window, with images that are four times sharper than current high definition TVs.

The tech on the bendable set allows users to determine how curved the screens should be taking into account how many people are watching and where they are sitting.

Two motors on either side of the 
screen work to push them out to create and set a curve. The screens have
 the added benefit of being able to be left flat against the wall when 
not in use.

The bendable TV 
appeared at Samsung’s launch event for its new range of UHD sets, which 
are led by the huge 110in version and a 105in curved option.

High-quality: The 105-inch curved model at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas

All the mainstream manufacturers, together with global TV and web broadcasters are joining forces to push the take-up of UHD sets in 2014.

The industry has spent millions of pounds on the UHD technology in the hope it will not suffer the same fate as 3D televisions, which have been rejected by consumers.

Samsung’s 110inch S9 TV is the world’s largest UHD Display, effectively turning the front room into a cinema. No price has yet been announced, however smaller 85inch versions currently sell for around £35,000.

Display: The screens boast around 11million pixels to enhance the quality of the image

Endorsement: Hollywood director Michael Bay promoted the product during the unveiling at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center in Las Vegas

Its 105in version is the first UHD television to have a fixed curved screen and boasts some 11million pixels to provide pin sharp images.

Guy Kinnell, the head of TV for Samsung Electronics in the UK said: ‘The combination of our curved design and UHD picture quality creates the ultimate immersive entertainment experience for people passionate about entertainment.’

At the moment, very few traditional TV channels are broadcasting programmes in the UHD format, however manufacturers have signed a deal with the likes of Netflix and Amazon’s Lovefilm to broadcast their output over the sets.

As an alternative, Samsung will sell a UHD Video Pack - a hard drive loaded with movies that can be connected to its TV sets. Sony already sells a similar box for its UHD sets.

This year’s football World Cup in Brazil will be the first major event to be broadcast in full Ultra HD to viewers in Japan, while the Rugby World Cup in England in 2015 will be the first in the UK.
