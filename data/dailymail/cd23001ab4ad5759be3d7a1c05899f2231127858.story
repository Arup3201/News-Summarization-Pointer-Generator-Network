We're often told that a positive attitude is key to getting ahead at work.

But it turns out people with an upbeat manner can actually be bad for business.

For a study has found that if staff are too chirpy it can lead to complacency and superficiality – rather than improved productivity and wellbeing.

Conversely, negative emotions can benefit a workplace if they are expressed constructively and in the right context.

Negative emotions in a workplace can be beneficial if expressed constructively and in the right context

For example, the researchers found that anger can lead to positive outcomes if it is motivated by perceived violations of moral standards. 

In this case it can prevent or stop injustices against a colleague, or it can make fellow workers avoid repeating mistakes. 

And having a grumpy, dissenting voice in team situations can stir up greater discussion by preventing the group reaching a consensus too quickly.

The University of Liverpool research – published in the journal Human Relations – concluded that commonly held assumptions about attitudes at work should therefore be questioned.

Dr Dirk Lindebaum, from the university’s school of management, said: ‘The findings challenge the widely held assumption that in the workplace positive emotions generate or engender a positive outcome, and vice versa.

‘They add to our knowledge and understanding of how the positive and negative dynamics affect the working environment and has practical application and relevance in the workplace.’
