A watch worn by Steve McQueen in the film 'Le Mans' had sold for nearly $800,000 at an auction of film memorabilia.

The movie star sported the timepiece in the 1971 action movie set in Monaco about the 24 hours of Le Mans car race.

The Tag Heuer Monaco has a black alligator skin strap and a stylish retro 60s style blue face. It was the first ever automatic and square cased chronograph watch.

The star wearing the wristwatch helped the brand to become a favourite of motor racing drivers and fans around the world.

Auctioneers had been expecting it to fetch hundreds of thousands of dollars but the sale surpassed expectations when the hammer came down at a staggering $799,500.

A signed U.S. passport belonging to McQueen fetched $46,125 during the auction at Profiles in History in Calabasas Hills, California.

Other items that were sold included a miniature drop-ship used in 'Aliens' for $225,000.

Groucho Marx's wire-rim glasses from 'A Night at the Opera' for $86,100 and Vivien Leigh's hat from 'Gone with the Wind' for $67,650 were also auctioned off.

One bidder paid $98,400 for Marlon Brando's assassination jacket from 'The Godfather.'

A personal copy of the 1971 film's script signed by Brando went for $55,000. The buyers were not identified.

Classic: A still from the 1971 movie about the 24 Hours of Le Mans motor race, which is considered by racing fans to be one of the greatest motorsports movies of all time

McQueen starred in Le Mans eight years after his most famous movie, The Great Escape.

He was arguably at the height of his fame and appeal when he appeared in the film.

It is considered by some fans to be one of the greatest motor sports movies of all time for its portrayal of the iconic 24 hours race around the streets of Le Mans in Monaco, France.

However, it did relatively badly in the U.S. as audiences were unfamiliar with the race.

Tag Heuer was founded in 1860 but after McQueen wore the watch in the film the brand became even more popular among motor sports fans and drivers.

The watch is one of several automatic Heuer chronographs that run on the Caliber 11 series of movements.

They were introduced in 1969 as a series of wrist watches made in honour of the Monaco Grand Prix.
