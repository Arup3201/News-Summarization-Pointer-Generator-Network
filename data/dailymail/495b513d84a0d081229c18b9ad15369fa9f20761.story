An Australian man convicted of the notorious 'body in the bath' murder of his fiancee has been freed on bail after spending 20 years behind bars.

Henry Victor Keogh, 57, was jailed for a minimum of 25 years when he was convicted of murdering his fiancee Anna-Jane Cheney, then 29, in their bath in March 1994.

In a landmark legal decision, Mr Keogh was granted a retrial after an appeal brought before Adelaide Supreme Court on Monday.

Henry Victor Keogh, 57, leaves court on bail on Monday after spending 20 years in gaol for the murder of his fiancee Anna-Jane Cheney, then 29, in March 1994

Ms Cheney's death was initially not treated as suspicious, until the then-chief forensic pathologist for South Australia, Colin Manock, claimed he had evidence pointing towards bruising on her ankles.

Mr Mancock alleged that this was consistent with the theory of forcible drowning, alleging that Mr Keogh, then 35, murdered his fiancee by grabbing her ankles, reported The Australian. 

The Court of Criminal Appeal ruled last Friday that Keogh should be granted the retrial, saying that there had been a substantial miscarriage of justice.

Mr Keogh, a former ­financier and insurance broker, was released on bail on Monday, which will see him home with his family for the first time in 20 years, a decision which was welcomed.

Alexis Atkins, who was nine when her father was taken into custody, has visited her father in jail since his incarceration. 

The 29-year-old labelled the Court's decision 'really quite surreal,' reported The Advertiser.

'Obviously, it’s really exciting and what we’ve been waiting 20 years for. I think the biggest thing I’m looking forward to is being able to spend time with him without there being time constraints or security guards watching over us, Mrs Atkins said. 

Compelling evidence was provided that aspects of Ms Cheney's autopsy lacked substantiation, and Ms Mancock recanted on evidence he had provided at Keogh's trial, the court heard.

In September Flinders University Professor Anthony Thomas told the Court that evidence was either incomplete or in disarray, reported The Advertiser.

Professor Thomas also drew the Court's attention to the swelling of Ms Cheney's face, which may have indicated she suffered an allergic reaction to an anti-histamine drug she had taken prior to her death.

Legal crusader and a supporter of Mr Keogh, Professor Bob Moles said that an independent forensic expert had been commissioned by Solicitor General in 2004, 'which came back and said that no murder had occurred'

Mr Keogh's brother, David Keogh, said that it would take some time for his brother to readjust to life 

Legal crusader and a supporter of Mr Keogh, Professor Bob Moles said that an independent forensic expert had been commissioned by Solicitor General in 2004, 'which came back and said that no murder had occurred'.

Professor Moles also told A Current Affair that the family were 'very disappointed that it’s taken so long to get here,' but that it was a tremendous day.

'He will feel relieved that the torment is over, but this will be difficult because this stems from the death of his fiancée,' said Professor Moles.  

Keogh will be the first person to be granted a full bench for a second time, under a new law introduced in South Australia in 2013. 

In a statement outside court, David Keogh said his brother would not comment on the case as it remained before the courts. 

But he thanked Keogh's lawyers and the many supporters who had contributed to his brother's legal fight.

'Today is a day to be hugely grateful for the progress thus far,' said Mr Keogh.

'Adjustment to normal life will be extraordinarily difficult after almost 20 years of incarceration,' he said. 

'He asks you all for some space to allow him to begin the process, surrounded by the people who love and care for him.' 

A large group of Mr Keogh's supporters gathered outside court and cheered as he stepped outside for the first time and made his way into a waiting car. 

Before Monday's decision, Mr Keogh had launched five mercy petitions to the South Australian Governor, insisting upon his innocence.

He has still not received a response from his last petition, which was lodged in 2009.  

The matter will return to court on February 2.
