An unidentified man who attempted to rob a cashier at gun point, fled the scene empty-handed before attempting to rob another teenager a short time afterwards.

Police now believe they may have identify the man who also threatened the cashier with a pair of scissors at a Werribee shopping centre on Wednesday.

'As the man entered the store he pulled a bandana up over his face and produced a small hand gun from his pocket,' Police Media officer Creina O'Grady said.

CCTV footage showed the unidentified man who attempted to rob a cashier at the Werribee shopping centre at gunpoint, entering the centre at 4.30pm on Wednesday

'He approached a female attendant at the cosmetics counter, telling her he would shoot her if she didn't open the till.

'As the attendant was opening the till, the man stepped up behind her and held a pair of scissors at her back, once again threatening her and demanding that she open the till.'

The man escaped without the money when he noticed another of the workers in the store calling police.

Police say the man also threatened the cashier woman with a pair of scissors to her back but fled when he noticed another worker calling police

He then proceeded to meet with an accomplice in a park at Barber Drive.

Police say the man and his accomplice attempted to rob a 19-year-old on his way home at Hoppers Crossing.

The two armed robbers assaulted the teen before again escaping with nothing.

'The victim received cuts and bruising as a result of the incident,' Ms O'Grady said.

CCTV footage of the first man, entering Werribee shopping centre before he pulled on the bandana and assaulted the cashier, was released by police in an attempt to help identify him.
