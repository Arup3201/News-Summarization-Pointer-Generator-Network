Payments: Bertie Ahern, the former Irish prime 
minister, took nearly 210,000 euros in secret 
payments while in office and lied about them

Former Irish prime minister Bertie Ahern took at least 209,779 euros (£174,764) in secret payments while in office and repeatedly lied about them under oath, an inquiry has found.

In a long-awaited end to an investigation into payments to politicians in the Republic, three judges also found two other former Fianna Fail lawmakers guilty of corrupt acts.

They stopped short of finding Ahern guilty of corruption because they found no evidence the veteran politician gave favours to any of his cash donors.

While the report itself was a fact-gathering effort and not a direct finding of any criminal wrongdoing, Prime Minister Enda Kenny referred its contents to prosecutors.

Potential offences include corruption, obstruction of justice and tax evasion.

No Irish politicians have been convicted of corruption as a result of the past 15 years of investigations into the bribery culture at the heart of Irish property development.

Prosecutions are hampered, in part, by the fact that the government passed no credible anti-bribery laws until 1996, leaving tax evasion as the only readily proven offence.

Ahern, whose often bizarre and implausible 2007 testimony enraptured the nation, denied doing anything wrong but resigned from office in 2008 after 11 years in power.

He was not at his Dublin home today but issued a brief statement saying he was reading the report.

His longtime accountant and personal friend, Des Peelo, conceded that Mr Ahern's testimony had been hard to swallow, but said the judges couldn't prove the former PM was lying.

'The fact that something is bizarre does not make it untrue. Some aspects of his finances were bizarre,' Mr Peelo said.

Ahern's former special adviser in government, Gerry Howlin, described the findings as 'far worse than anything I expected or believed possible.'

'He told me he was telling the truth,' Mr Howlin said. 'His narrative is not believed, and it is damning and it is serious. ... His reputation has been very seriously damaged.'

Several lawmakers in Fianna Fail called on its current leader, Micheal Martin, to expel Ahern from the party as punishment.

Mr Martin has called a meeting of party officials to discuss the matter tonight.

Voters last year ousted Fianna Fail from power and decimated its parliamentary ranks, a historic defeat driven by Ireland's humiliating negotiation of an international bailout.

Ahern, 60, did not seek re-election.

Interest in the judges' final 3,211-page report - the product of a 15-year investigation expected to cost taxpayers more than 200million euros (£167million) - was so great that the investigators' Web site repeatedly crashed.

'Much of the explanation provided by Mr Ahern as to the source of the substantial funds identified and inquired into in the course of the tribunal's public hearings was deemed by the tribunal to be untrue,' the judges found.

They accused Ahern's government, which founded the original fact-finding tribunal in 1997, of launching a sustained attack on their work once the target of their investigation turned out to be Ahern himself.

During his 15 days of testimony in 2007, Ahern admitted keeping most of the money in personal safes at his office and home from 1992 to 1994.

He also admitted failing to keep a personal bank account during much of the time under investigation and paying no tax on any of the cash until the investigators uncovered its existence.

Ahern testified that undocumented cash payments he received while in Britain were all unsolicited gifts, while identical payments he received in Ireland were loans.

Under tax law at the time, overseas gifts and domestic loans were not taxable. Ahern made no repayments on the 1993 'loans' until the investigators discovered them in 2007.

He ultimately negotiated a tax settlement for the unearthed funds.

The judges repeatedly dismissed Ahern's explanations for the source of myriad Nineties cash payments in Irish pounds, British pounds and U.S. dollars that eventually were deposited into accounts in the name of his then-girlfriend, Celia Larkin, and his two daughters.

He claimed to have won much of the money betting on horses.

They rejected testimony provided by Ahern and several business friends who claimed to have raised money for him without his consent at a pub event in December 1993.

The judges instead accepted as truthful the testimony of a senior Dublin stockbroker whom Ahern had identified as one of those friends.

The stockbroker said he barely knew Ahern and had been asked by Fianna Fail to make a 5,000 euro (£4,166) political donation in a check made out to Ahern, which he did.

The judges said they could not prove or rule out allegations by an Irish property developer, Tom Gilmartin, that a rival developer paid Ahern two bribes in 1989 and 1992 totaling more than 100,000 euros (£83,328).

Mr Gilmartin testified that he bribed Padraig Flynn, a former Cabinet minister and European Union commissioner, and another Fianna Fail lawmaker, Liam Lawlor, as part of his unsuccessful effort to develop a Dublin shopping center.

The judges accepted that Mr Gilmartin paid Flynn about 63,500 euros (£52,913), which the EU commissioner used towards buying a farm in his wife's name.

They found that the businessman paid Lawlor £75,000 (91,000 euros), and that both payments were corrupt.

Lawlor was briefly imprisoned several times for obstructing the tribunal's work and was killed in a Moscow car crash in 2005 while on a personal trip to buy properties.

Personally popular: In his 2007 testimony to the Mahon Tribunal, Ahern admitted keeping most of the cash in safes and not paying any tax on the money

Ahern, who cultivated a persona as an affable and plain-spoken Dubliner, was personally popular while in office and credited with leading a frugal personal life.

He was Fianna Fail's fund-raising director in the early Nineties and a protege of former Prime Minister Charles Haughey, who was found guilty by a previous tribunal of receiving more than 10million euros (£8.3million) in secret payments from many of Ireland's top businessmen while in office.

Haughey faced no criminal charges, paid taxes and penalties of 6.5million euros (£5.4million), and died in 2006.
