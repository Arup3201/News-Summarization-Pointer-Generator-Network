A pensioner killed herself by deliberately driving her mobility scooter into a shallow lake having never recovered from the grief of losing a daughter almost 40 years earlier, an inquest heard.

Depressed Brenda Nelson was discovered face down in the water after heading at ‘full speed’ into 2ft of water at Barton Marina, in Staffordshire, the coroner was told.

Two hours earlier the married 66-year-old had driven towards oncoming traffic and head-on into the path of a truck, a police officer told the hearing.

Tragic: Brenda Nelson, 66, had tried to kill herself several times before deliberately driving her mobility scooter into this lake, an inquest heard

Tragic Mrs 
Nelson, from Barton-under-Needwood, had suffered a series of mental 
breakdowns since her three-year-old daughter died in 1974, it was said.

South Staffordshire Coroner Andrew Haigh ruled that Mrs Nelson ‘killed herself while depressed’.

‘Mrs Nelson was a lady with problems both mentally and physically and it was a vicious circle,’ he said.

'There was nothing anyone could have done' to prevent the tragedy, the coroner said

‘She
was in regular pain and was very depressed.

'I believe she did take her 
own life and her mental state was a major factor. I offer my condolences 
to the family.

‘There was nothing anyone could have done and she seemed very determined to take her own life.’

Detective
Constable Tess Crabb, of Burton CID, earlier told the hearing at Burton
Town Hall: ‘Following a thorough investigation we found she had driven 
straight into the lake at a 90-degree angle on full speed before landing
in 2ft of water.

‘We found 
no suicide note but we believe her intentions were deliberate, having 
tried to commit suicide a week prior as well as two hours before by 
driving into on-coming traffic.

'She also asked her husband to help her 
commit suicide a week before but he said no.’

The tragedy happened on September 28 last year, after Mrs Nelson went missing from home, where she lived with husband Alan.

‘At
4.35pm we received a call that a scooter had been spotted in the lake 
at Barton Marina and at 4.47pm we discovered Mrs Nelson face down in the
water,’ said Mr Crabb.

‘She was rescued by firefighters but pronounced dead at 5.45pm.’

He added: ‘Mrs Nelson lost her three-year-old daughter in 1974 
which led her to a breakdown and for her to start drinking heavily. She 
attempted suicide shortly after and had a history of trying to take her 
own life.’

The inquest heard how Mrs Nelson had attempted suicide a week earlier by taking drug overdose.

The
coroner was also told she had declined help from a psychiatrist offered
to her by a community nurse and her GP, doctor David Okoye.

Distraught: The inquest heard that Mrs Nelson has never recovered from the grief of losing her three-year-old daughter in 1974

Dr Okoye said in evidence that Mrs Nelson suffered with a number of chronic medical conditions which affected her quality of life.

At the time of Mrs Nelson’s death a neighbour said she had always seemed a ‘pleasant and polite person’.

She said: ‘Mrs Nelson and her husband Alan have lived here for years. Mrs Nelson always used to be an active lady and we used to see her cycling in and around the village.

‘She also used to cook meals for an elderly gentleman who lived across the road, however, she was taken ill a few years back and ended up using a mobility scooter.

‘The couple had a daughter who died several years ago. It is very, very sad what has happened. She was a lovely lady who always seemed pleasant and polite.’
