There was an undeniable connection between two-year-old Zackary Walton and his idol Jono Lancaster when they first met on Monday.

Zackary, who has Treacher Collins syndrome, had the opportunity of a lifetime to spend three days with his hero - a one of the world's most recognised individual who suffers from the same genetic disorder.

Mother Sarah Walton, who contacted Mr Lancaster and asked him to spend time with her son during his nation-wide tour to educate schools about Treacher Collins syndrome, says the 30-year-old of West Yorkshire has left a huge impact on her family.

The rare genetic disorder - which affects one child in every 50,000 - prevents the skull, cheek and jawbones from developing properly.

'Jono is a very important person to our family,' Mrs Walton told Daily Mail Australia.

'Not only is a huge celebrity and a hero to us but to have the same condition as our son and to have such a positive attitude is very inspiring.

Treacher Collins syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the growth and development of the head. 

It prevents the skull, cheek and jawbones from developing properly, causing facial defects and hearing loss. About one child in every 50,000 is affected. 

Problems range in severity from mild to very severe. In most cases, the child's intelligence is normal.

'His visit and how completely fine is after everything he has been through has given us hope for Zackary.

'He is an important role model to anyone anywhere upset about how they look and his speeches have helped change people's attitudes to love themselves for who they are.'

Mr Lancaster arrived on Monday to meet the Walton family and stayed in Mannum, in South Australia, about an hour and a half from Adelaide.

'One of my biggest fears as a mother is that Zackary won't be accepted at school,' Mrs Walton said.

'But knowing that Jono is doing a tour to educate schools about Treacher Collins syndrome, it makes me feel relieved. 

'It gives me hope that my son can grow up to be a happy man.'

Mrs Walton says she witnessed the strong bond between the her son and Mr Lancaster on Monday afternoon.

'Zac is quite shy and doesn't warm up to anyone easily but for some reason, I don't know what it was, he connected with Jono,' she said.

'Maybe it's because Jono is such a friendly and caring person who isn't judgemental.'

Just recently, Mrs Walton pleaded with the South Australian Government after they announced they were going to take away the highly-trained nurse who helps look after her son Zackary one day a week.

The mother of five whose two-year-old son could die at any moment without round the clock care has told how she 'cried with happiness' after her campaign to stop her son's help being cut was successful. 

Zackary also has a tracheostomy, which means his airway is compromised and could be obstructed at any moment.

'We have to monitor him around the clock. It's already highly stressful and exhausting, and the one day of respite care allowed us to get by,' Mrs Walton wrote on a change.org petition that has been signed by over 37,000 people. 

The 27-year-old found out in October that the National Disability Insurance Scheme will reinstate Zackary's nurse after public outcry about the decision to cut his help.

The family live in Mannum and living rurally means their local hospital isn't trained to deal with emergencies for people with a tracheostomy.

Mrs Walton, who also looks after her four other children at home while her husband works long hours to make ends meet, said the response has been 'overwhelming'.

'I cried I was so happy. It just means so much. It means I will be able to manage, to look forward to things and plan things again,' Mrs Walton told Daily Mail Australia.

'I can do all the things everyone takes for granted again - one day a week - now without worrying about equipment or life or death.

'I can get in the car and just breathe.'

On Mrs Walton's moving change.org petition she wrote: 'It's a scary weight to carry around, knowing that it's up to me to know what to do and keep my son alive'

Mrs Walton is looking forward to being able to continue to take her other children - Patience, Imali, Briella and Kynan - to the movies and the beach one day a week in the school holidays.

'Zackary can't go anywhere like that so the other kids miss out,' she said.

'And I can get my hair done and go food shopping, pay the bills, get in and out of the car, have coffee and have time to organise birthday presents - just the little things.'

The mother described how Zackary 'absolutely adores' the nurse who looks after him one day a week and is 'very particular with people'.

Over the next few years things are only going to get harder for the Walton family as Zackary begins major re-constructive surgery.

The relief Mrs Walton feels knowing that a nurse will be there to help - at least for the foreseeable future - is palpable.

Having a nurse for Zackary means Mrs Walton can take her four other children, Patience, Imali, Briella and Kynan, to the cinema and the beach in the school holidays 

Zackary 'absolutely adores' the nurse who looks after him one day a week, Mrs Walton said

'If anything it will get worse, not him but the issues he faces. For example he doesn't get head colds, it goes straight through his lungs… he will be starting kinder soon and the more he goes out the more he gets sick,' she said describing the challenges ahead.

'He will also have some big surgery. From next year he will have a jaw… they will break it at the back and slowly turn it millimetres per day to bring it forward. He will also have his checks rebuilt and the surgery will go into adulthood.

'There is no guarantee that he'll ever not need a feeding tube.'

On Mrs Walton's moving change.org petition she wrote: 'It's a scary weight to carry around, knowing that it's up to me to know what to do and keep my son alive. It's a weight parents of children with tracheostomies shouldn't have to bear just because they live in a rural area.

'That's not right. We can't easily just move. We own our home, we'd need to uproot our other children, we have family here, we have hopes and dreams and aspirations for our future in this town. We just want to safely be able to include our son in that future.'

The family are still calling for more training about tracheostomy patients for doctors and nurses in rural hospitals.

'This is my son's life at stake. It's also the lives of many other children with tracheostomy who are being ignored and neglected. Right now it seems like only a matter of time before the unthinkable happens, and someone like my son dies because of the lack of training and help the government is giving to rural tracheostomy patients,' she wrote.
