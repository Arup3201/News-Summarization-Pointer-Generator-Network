A high-powered real-estate mogul who owns numerous properties in Brooklyn, leased a house in Philadelphia to his mistress in exchange for sex, claims his wife in an explosive new lawsuit.

Grace Chang Venner claims husband Stuart Venner had originally put her name on the 40-year lease for the three-storey rowhouse, but changed it last January to that of his mistress Panadda Pratomtang

The agreement allows her to live in the house for $1 per month until the year 2053 'in return for her providing prostitution services to Board Member, (Stuart) Venner,' the lawsuit alleges.

Pratomtang first had a lease agreement for a year beginning in August 2012 - just after Venner bought the property for $900,000, reports the Philadelphia Daily News.

But in January 2014, the agreement was amended to the highly unusual 40-year lease.

Grace Chang Venner only found out after she was added last March as a manager of 421 Pine LLC, the real-estate business created by her husband for the Society Hill rowhouse, according to the suit.

'The lease agreement is not based on actual consideration, but rather on sex for rent,' the lawsuit says. 'This is prostitution pursuant to Pennsylvania law and an illegal contract.'

Stuart Venner, who was pictured on New York Social Diary attending a formal dinner at the luxury Doubles club in the Sherry Netherland, New York, with his wife in 2013, told the Daily News he was unaware of the lawsuit and called the allegations 'ridiculous.'

The lawsuit asks that the lease agreement be to voided, stating that Pratomtang committed fraud when she 'knowingly concealed the true nature of her agreement with Stuart Venner... when she knew or should have known that [her] conduct was illegal and would have materially altered the lease, rendering it illegal.'

The suit also seeks attorney's fees and punitive damages for the wife.
