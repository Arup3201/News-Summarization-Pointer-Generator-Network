It's a label she has turned to on many of her most important occasions and, as a result, the Duchess of Cambridge has rocketed Jenny Packham to fashion fame.

But what does the British designer, who has provided the Duchess with some of her most iconic outfits - most notably the spotty dress she wore she left hospital following the birth of Prince George - make of her success?

Speaking about the dazzling black evening dress with fern embellishment that Kate wore last week at a lavish State Reception in New Zealand, a nonchalant Packham told WWD: 'Sometimes when we dress celebrities, there are always loads of Twitters and things like that when I wake up, I think, "Oh right, she wore it."

Packham’s business and life partner Matthew Anderson added: 'We always seem to be away when these things happen.'

The
 duo were also away for another of Kate's most photographed moments - when she left
 St. Mary’s Hospital with Prince George last year wearing a blue and 
white polka dot dress by the British designer.

When
 the fashion site asked if she worked directly with Kate, the designer said: 
'Absolutely. It’s always quite a collaboration,' adding that she 'kind 
of always knows where it’s going to be worn.'

Jenny,
 who describes Kate's style as 'great' and 'very British', also dressed Kate 
Winslet for the London premiere of Divergent two weeks ago.

Kate also wore a Jenny Packham creation to a black tie gala at the National Portrait Gallery in February, having first worn it in October at a Kensington Palace dinner.

The Duchess dazzled in a glittering floor-length gown as she accompanied husband William to the Tusk foundation gala dinner at The Royal Society in London back in September last year.

She even left hospital after the birth of Prince George wearing in a blue and white polka dot dress, which she wore to introduce the baby prince to the world.

Possessing one of the most scrutinised, emulated and adored wardrobes in the world, Kate's Jenny Packham outfit 
attracted almost as much attention as the newborn future king.

So much so, that one of the biggest clothing brands in the country saw polka-dot dresses similar to Kate's sell out within hours.

The
 Jenny Packham label was founded in 1988, focusing on bridal dresses and 
evening wear, and has since acquired fans such as Emma Roberts and Dita 
Von Teese.

The
 designer is currently preparing to take America by storm, where she 
will host her first ready-to-wear trunk show at Neiman Marcus in Los 
Angeles on Thursday.

The Duchess of Cambridge has long been the reigning Queen of style but a new piece of research shows that her title is in jeopardy.

The study, aimed at discovering the celebrity styles that British women most envy and attempt to recreate whilst shopping, has revealed that Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Middleton and Beyoncé have the most desired wardrobes.

On average, women confessed that they would spend an extra £38 on a fashion purchase in order to emulate a particular celebrity’s style or look.  

When asked who they most emulate when shopping, respondents voted Jennifer Lawrence (38 per cent) ahead of Kate, who garnered 34 per cent of the votes.

Beyonce, Rita Ora, Lily Allen, Kate Moss, Holly Willoughby, as well as Kim Kardashian, Rihanna and Fearne Cotton made the top ten, found the study by Vouchercodes.co.uk.
