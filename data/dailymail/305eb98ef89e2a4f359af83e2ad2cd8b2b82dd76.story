Swansea manager Garry Monk insists summer signing Bafetimbi Gomis has been signed to play with and put pressure on Wilfried Bony - not replace him.

Gomis joined Swansea on a four-year contract from Lyon in June and has plenty of pedigree having scored over 140 goals in French football and won 12 caps for France.

The 29-year-old's arrival caused speculation about the possible departure of Bony, who scored 25 goals last season during an excellent first campaign in England, and the frontman was linked to Liverpool and Tottenham after impressing for the Ivory Coast at the World Cup in Brazil.

Signing: Garry Monk said Bafetimbi Gomnis was brought to the club to compete with Wilfried Bony

But Monk is adamant the pair can thrive together after free transfer Gomis claimed his first goal in English football on Tuesday night to ease Swansea into the third round of the Capital One Cup.

'It's definitely not the case that he's his replacement,' Monk said about Gomis, whose strike put paid to the cup ambitions of Championship outfit Rotherham.

'I don't think it's about pressure on Bony.

'Through the season we'll see different things: they'll play as lone strikers, they'll play as a pair, use them in different ways.

Transfer: Monk said he is not worried about Bony's future and no bids have been made for the Ivorian striker

'It's not a competition between them but obviously we want them all to push each other and every striker will want to be top scorer.

'But it's about them working together which they've done very well in pre-season and been great with each other on the training field.'

Monk insists Swansea have received no offers for Bony with the transfer deadline now only five days away.

'We haven't had one offer for Bony. It hasn't worried me, the speculation didn't concern me because we had it with others like Ashley Williams over the years and it's the way it is,' Monk said.

Pedigree: Gomis spent five years with French side Lyon and also has 12 caps for the national side

'When you get a formal offer is perhaps when you worry about it, but I'm prepared to use them both.

'If someone comes in with an offer, that's the only time you think about it.

'It's not over until the window closes and that's with all of our players, an offer could come in for any of them.

'But I can't concern myself with that because my focus is on preparing for the football and West Brom on the weekend.

'If something comes in I'll deal with it then.'

Concern: Monk says no offers have come in for either Bony or captain Ashley Williams
