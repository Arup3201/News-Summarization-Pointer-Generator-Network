A Colorado judge has ruled that theater shooting suspect James Holmes can be given ‘truth serum’ for his medical examinations if he pleads not guilty by reason of insanity.

Judge William Blair Sylvester issued an order Monday issued the court order Monday.

If Holmes offers a not guilty plea, he could be required to submit to the 'narcoanalytic interview' as part of an evaluation to determine if he was legally insane at the time of the July 20 shootings.

Subject: Suspect James Holmes could be required to submit to a 'narcoanalytic interview' as part of an evaluation to determine if he was legally insane at the time of the July 20 shootings

The prospect of such interviews that may ensue under such a plea alarmed defense attorneys, who filed documents opposing the technique.

Suspect: Holmes is accused of killing 12 people at an Aurora movie theater on July 20

A narcoanalylitic interview is a decades-old process in which patients are given drugs to lower their inhibition. Academic studies have shown that the technique has involved the use of sodium amytal and pentothal, sometimes called truth serum.

Holmes, 25, is scheduled to enter a plea Tuesday to multiple counts of murder and attempted murder. He is charged with killing 12 people and injuring 70 at a midnight showing of 'The Dark Knight Rises' in the Denver suburb of Aurora.

If Holmes pleads not guilty by reason of insanity, he would be examined by doctors at the state mental hospital.

In an advisory that Holmes would have
to sign if he enters an insanity plea, Sylvester didn't specify what 
type of drugs would be used but said the examination could include 
'medically appropriate' ones.

Sylvester said Holmes also could be given a polygraph examination as part of the evaluation.
After reading a draft of the advisory, Holmes' lawyers objected, saying a
narcoanalytic interview and a polygraph would violate their client's 
rights.

In the final version of the advisory,
Sylvester said he had incorporated some suggestions from the defense 
and the prosecution, but he did not address the defense objections to a 
narcoanalytic interview and polygraph.

Karen Steinhauser, a former 
prosecutor who is a law professor at the University of Denver and a 
defense attorney, said she could not find any case law about use of the 
narcoanalytic interview.

'It comes up so rarely,' she said, adding she knows nothing about it.

She noted the technique is clearly allowed by Colorado law.

That hospitalization, defense lawyers noted, was separate from an earlier incident where Holmes was treated at a hospital for injuries 'that resulted from potential self-inflicted head injuries in his cell.'

The motion said the sheriff's office refused to give the video to prosecutors or defense attorneys at the direction of Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson.

Robinson told Reuters on Friday night that he had released a 'relevant video to both sides,' but citing a gag order imposed by the judge in the case, declined to comment on its contents.

Robinson said his office had been 'straightforward and cooperative' in the case, and that he would not release the hospital video because it was taken outside his jurisdiction.

'I told them (attorneys) that I didn't 
have the authority to give them that video because it was taken in 
Denver and they'd have to go through them,' he said.

In rejecting the defense motion to declare Colorado's insanity defense law unconstitutional, Sylvester said defense lawyers had raised the issue prematurely since Holmes had yet to enter a plea, and prosecutors had not indicated whether they would seek the death penalty.

Lawyers for Holmes last week challenged the constitutionality of a Colorado statute that requires a defendant who raises an insanity defense to submit to examinations by court-appointed psychiatrists.

Defense lawyers argued that the law, which would compel Holmes to provide potentially damaging information that could be used against him at trial, or at sentencing should he be convicted, violated his Fifth Amendment guarantee of protection against self-incrimination.
