The family and friends of a 21-month-old Michigan girl who has died from enterovirus D68 have paid tribute to their 'sweet baby angel'.

Madeline Reid, from Clinton Township, was put on life support on September 14 after contracting the deadly virus, which has flu-like symptoms and continues to sweep the country.

But following a long battle during which she was left paralyzed, she died in her parents' arms at around 3pm yesterday, according to a Facebook tribute page.

It means she is the second child to have died directly as a result of enterovirus D68 this year following the death of four-year-old Eli Waller, from Hamilton, New Jersey, on September 25.

Tragic: Toddler Madeline Reid, of Michigan, has died in her parents' arms after contracting enterovirus D68

Missed: Madeline (pictured with her father, Anthony), from Clinton Township, was put on life support on September 14. But following a long battle during which she was left paralyzed, she passed away yesterday

Happier times: Madeline (left and right) fell ill after suffering from a runny nose, her mother Amanda Reid said

In a statement, Dr Rudolph Valentini, chief medical officer at Children's Hospital of Michigan in Detroit, confirmed Madeline's death, which is the first reported fatality from the virus in Michigan.

'It is never easy to lose a child, and our entire health care team at the Children's Hospital of Michigan is deeply saddened by this family's loss and mourns with them during this very difficult time,' he said.

On the Facebook page, titled 'Team Maddie!', a family member wrote yesterday: 'Our sweet baby girl Madeline Reid became our angel at 2:55 p.m.

'She passed peacefully in her mother and father's arms. Thank you all again for your kind words and support. Please respect the parents at this very difficult time.'

Facebook user Leean Preston, 'Such a sweet precious life taken entirely too soon', while Fatima Teran, from Chicago, Illinois, added: 'God has gained a beautiful angel, RIP Maddie.'

Madeline first fell ill after suffering from a runny nose, her mother Amanda Reid toldFox 2 earlier this month. After her symptoms worsened, she was rushed to hospital and placed on life support.

There, the toddler suffered congestive heart failure, according to a GoFundMe page set up to help pay for her medical bills. 'From [the runny nose] it went to congestive heart failure,' said Ms Reid.

She added: 'We knew that it all stemmed from the virus because Maddie was a healthy baby. She never was hospitalized before.' 

Madeline, one of three siblings, also suffered damage to most of her other organs, developed myocarditis, had two massive strokes and was left paralyzed on one side, Detroit News reported.

She was scheduled for surgery to receive a mechanical heart to support her body while awaiting a transplant, but was too ill to go ahead with it. Instead, she was placed in a medically-induced coma.

Disease: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, five people with enterovirus (pictured) have now died nationwide. Madeline's death was the first reported fatality from the virus in Michigan

A spokesman for Detroit Medical Center, where Madeline was initially treated, said the hospital would like to express its 'sincere condolences' to her family following her death yesterday afternoon.

She said: 'Since mid-August the CDC has reported higher numbers of children experiencing respiratory illnesses caused by Enterovirus D68 with confirmed cases in 45 states.

'The DMC will continue to work with both the Michigan Department of Community Health and the CDC to monitor patients and provide the most appropriate care and support.' 

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), five people with enterovirus have now died nationwide, but it is not clear in all cases what role the virus played. 

Other victims: Emily Otrando (left), 10, and four-year-old Eli Waller (right) have both died from the lethal virus. Eli's became the first confirmed child fatality from the virus, while Emily's death is still under investigation

Victims of the virus include 10-year-old Emily Otrando, from Rhode Island, who died on September 22. However, the virus is yet to be confirmed as the direct cause of her death.

In total, 691 people from 46 states and the District of Columbia have been affected, the CDC said.

The majority of the cases are believed to be children. Only Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, Hawaii and Alaska have not seen any cases.

The illness, which has flu and cold-like symptoms, causes severe respiratory illness and can lead to difficulty breathing in infants and young children, officials have said.

Enteroviruses, which bring on symptoms like a very intense cold, aren't unusual and typically peak in September into fall.

They usually resemble a bad cold, but this particular strain has become a great concern for parents across the US after a number of fatalities among children.

What is proving so worrisome about this particular strain?

ED-D68 was first identified in the 1960s and is uncommon, but has been cropping up in recent years in Georgia, Pennsylvania and abroad in Japan and the Netherlands.

However, the bottom line is that experts cannot explain why it is has flared so dramatically this year.

They also cannot explain why it is proving so virulent.

Signs and symptoms

ED-D68 begins as a cold, with coughing, fever and wheezing.

The virus can cause breathing difficulties but most recover well after a week.

How serious is it?

While experts have said that in theory some cases can become so severe they result in death, many of the EV-D68 infections 'will be mild and self-limited, requiring only symptomatic treatment,' according to the Missouri health agency.

How can infection be prevented?

This particular enterovirus is spread through bodily contact, making children far more susceptible.

Health officials have said there is not much that can be done about it other than washing hands with soap and disinfecting surfaces.

There's no vaccine for EV-D68. 

The disease can spread through droplets in coughs or sneezes or when someone touches a contaminated surface, such as a countertop or doorknob, it is reported.

There is no vaccine or specific treatment. 

As of Tuesday, 31 cases in Michigan had tested positive for enterovirus D68, according to Jennifer Smith, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Community Health.
