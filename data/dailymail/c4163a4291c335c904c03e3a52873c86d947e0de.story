When you spend your days in the icy Alaskan wilderness, you have to make your own fun.

Maybe the smell fish was too much to resist and the bear was hoping to find an easy meal.

But after spotting a net left behind by a subsistence fisherman, this polar bear took some time out to play in the snow with its new 'toy'.

In a tangle: This polar bear plays with a fishing net in North Slope, Alaska

Paws for some fun: Intrigued by the foreign material, the curious polar bear gets itself all wrapped up

The images of the usually fearsome 
predator enjoying itself were captured by wildlife photographer Steven 
Kazlowski, 44, in the North Slope region of Alaska.

'The bear was just playing with the net and at no time was it stuck or trapped,' Steven said.

'I thought it might but the more I watched, the more I could see the bear knew exactly what it was doing.

Frolicking: New York-born wildlife photographer Steven Kazlowski, 44, was in the North Slope region of Alaska when he spotted the animal playing with a discarded net

Snow trouble: Photographer Steven Kazlowski said the wild animal was not trapped by the net but just enjoying playing with the unusual item

'It would put the net over its head and get under it, pulling it over its body and playing with it with a sense of pure joy.'

The bear, believed to be between 4 and 6 years old, grappled with the net for nearly an hour before the novelty began to wear thin.

'When it was done, it got out of the net and stood up and moved on,' the photographer added.

The
New York-born snapper took the shots from the safety of a skiff off the
shore of a barrier island along Alaska’s eastern Arctic coast.

Game time: The predator spent about an hour playing around in the snow with the net left behind by a fisherman

Frolic: The polar bear enjoys playing with the net and having a nibble at one of the floats attached to its edge

Bite: The flimsy net is no match for the large predator, thought to be aged between four and six years old

Carefree: The polar bear was oblivious to photographer Steven Kazlowski, who caught a series of charming portraits of the animal

'It is not dangerous to photograph bears if you follow a few simple rules: give them their space, and be on a platform that is safe and allows you to move out of the area and away from the bears when it is time to go,' Steven said.

'You also need to watch the bear and pay attention to the animal and its behaviour.

'It takes time to learn how to read the behaviour of the animal to understand what is safe and what is not safe.'

Flexing: This playful polar bear gets itself into all sorts of contortions as it takes an hour off hunting to have some fun with a fishing net

Playful: With thousands of miles of white and featureless wilderness, this polar bear appeared happy for something novel to play with

Looking at Kazlowski’s heartwarming images of the polar bear tumbling in the Alaskan snow, it is easy to forget that we are observing one of nature’s most powerful hunters at work.

'It is good to see such a large predator take so much time out for play, it shows it is one of the great joys of a polar bear’s life,' the photographer added.
