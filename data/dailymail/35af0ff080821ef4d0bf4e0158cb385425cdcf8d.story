Scotland may not have won at Twickenham since 1983 — but captain Greig Laidlaw insists there is no reason why Vern Cotter’s men should head south with an inferiority complex this weekend.

From what he has seen in his first season in the Aviva Premiership with Gloucester, Laidlaw reckons England’s players are anything but invincible.

They are good, he says, but no better than those currently wearing the dark blue.

‘I’ve always thought highly of the England players but seeing them down there just shows me that we can win,’ said Laidlaw. ‘They are not invincible, that’s definitely not the case.

‘I believe they are good players but you look at Glasgow Warriors when they played Bath in Europe this season and how well they did.

‘Bath were going well in the Premiership but Glasgow beat them at home and arguably could have won down there, too. It wasn’t really Glasgow’s first team as they had a lot of injuries that day — and it probably was close to Bath’s first team.’

Laidlaw’s emotions are running high ahead of the Calcutta Cup clash, especially after team-mate Stuart Hogg told Sportsmail he feels there is a lack of respect for Scottish rugby south of the border.

Laidlaw made a similar point before the start of the Six Nations, based on the experiences of his first season with Gloucester, following his move from Edinburgh.

For Laidlaw, a win at Twickenham will not only belatedly ignite Scotland’s Six Nations campaign, following defeats to France, Wales and Italy, it will give him bragging rights in the Gloucester dressing room and make him even more proud to be a Scot south of the border.

‘Respect has to be earned and that is something we’ll be aiming to do at the weekend,’ he said.

‘The England boys will respect us if we do a job on the field.

‘We’re not far away from getting things right but I’m getting pretty sick of telling people that, I really am. It’s up to us as players to step up, go again and put in that performance against England.

‘We have had some tough talking from the coaches this week and rightly so since the defeat to Italy — but it has been good as we have been shooting ourselves in the foot a lot of the time and we have to change.

‘We have now seen both sides of Vern Cotter this week. He is a hard man and rightly so. He has high standards and we have certainly seen what he is all about — and that’s good. We know what is expected of us and he is a very clever coach who wants to make sure we come away from Twickenham with a positive result.’

Laidlaw also has two very personal reasons for wanting to lead Scotland to what would be a famous victory at Twickenham.

The first is to emulate his uncle, Roy Laidlaw, who helped his team to a Calcutta Cup win back in 1983.

The other is to wipe out the memory of last year’s 20-0 defeat by England at BT Murrayfield. It still makes him bristle and was arguably his worst performance in a Scotland shirt.

Nothing went right for Laidlaw that day and, after missing two penalties and struggling to make any sort of impression on the game, the Scotland skipper was replaced by Chris Cusiter after 65 minutes. 

The boos that rang round the stadium at the final whistle hurt Laidlaw and he knows that defeat, on top of Scotland’s dreadful Six Nations campaign so far this season, makes it vitally important to put things right at the home of English rugby.

‘That was personally one of my worst games for Scotland, to be honest,’ he admitted.

‘I don’t think many of the boys played well that day for whatever reason.

‘It was made worse because we were playing England. It is the oldest game in the world and you want to do yourself proud — and we didn’t.

‘Vern’s analysis this week has been about going back a bit further into previous Six Nations tournaments and he has been on our case. He has certainly been on my case, that’s for sure, after he brought up that match.

‘We’ve had a look at that last game when we lost 20-0 and he pointed out mistakes in that match and told us we need to learn quickly and not make those same mistakes again.

‘We certainly want to turn around that defeat and how we have performed in this Six Nations, if we can, by winning at Twickenham and there is slightly more added spice to the fixture because it is England down there.

‘I’ve talked to my uncle Roy about their win in 1983 but that was a different group of players and the guys who won more than 30 years ago have made their own bit of history.

‘It’s up to us now to make our own bit of history and go down there and be strong and have the mentality that we can impose our game on them — and not worry about what is coming out of the other changing room.’

Much will rest on the performance of second-row Jonny Gray, who turns 21 on Saturday.

He has already come of age for Scotland and is calling the line-outs. In the absence of big brother Richie through injury, there is now even more responsibility on his shoulders.

There was an indication against the Italians of how much Gray is respected by Cotter when, with Laidlaw taken off and vice-captain Ross Ford off injured, he was asked to fill in as skipper near the end of the game.

It was a dream come true for the second row, who knows he has a huge role to play against England.

‘It’s very special to be a part of the Scotland squad in the first place, then to lead your country is something you grow up dreaming about,’ he said.

‘To have done that, even if for only a couple of minutes against Italy, was a huge honour and a very special feeling.

‘The result was hugely disappointing but we have to put that behind us now.

‘We have been looking at the England game and what we need to fix and we’re just training hard to try to get it right.

‘It will be a huge occasion in an amazing stadium against a tough England team. They have got a very strong pack and the driving maul is a real strength of theirs, so that is an area we will be working hard on this week.’
