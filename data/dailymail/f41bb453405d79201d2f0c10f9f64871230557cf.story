Scottish Championship side Alloa Athletic have pulled off a coup with the shock signing of former English Premier League star Michael Chopra.

The former Newcastle, Sunderland and Cardiff forward was most recently contracted to Indian side Kerala Blasters, and had been training with Port Vale.

But managerless minnows Alloa – who play on a plastic pitch at 3100-capacity Indodrill Stadium – have announced they had signed the 31-year-old until the end of the season, subject to international clearance.

Alloa, who are known as the Wasps, face Rangers on Tuesday night in the Championship and the club are hoping international clearance will be received in time for Chopra to make his debut at Ibrox. 

The Clackmannanshire club moved for Chopra after their head of recruitment, Lee Ebden, became aware of the striker's availability after he left cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar's football club in India

Caretaker boss Paddy Connolly, filling the dugout after boss Barry Smith quit, was thrilled with the capture and reckons Chopra's experience could be vital for the Wasps in their fight for Championship survival.

'We are delighted to bring someone of Michael's pedigree into the club,' Connolly told the Alloa Advertiser.

The 31-year-old started his footballing career as a youngster on Newcastle's books

'When the chance came up from the chairman, I felt it was a no brainer because of the level he has played at in the game.

'He's played in the Premiership down south for many years and then played abroad so he is a very experienced. I know the player through watching him over the years and he is still only 31 so I am sure he still has plenty to offer.

'He is still short of some match sharpness, but I am sure his arrival will be a lift for the players and the club as whole.'
