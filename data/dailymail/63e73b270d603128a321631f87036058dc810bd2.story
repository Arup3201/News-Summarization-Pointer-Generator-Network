Yes, they can do it on a cold night at Portman Road?

Perhaps it wasn't an emphatic performance by Southampton - but that doesn't matter in the FA Cup.

Following their heroics at Old Trafford on Sunday, Ronald Koeman's side had to raise themselves for the less glamorous surroundings of Ipswich or face being on the end of a shock defeat.

The Dutchman's side answered all the questions levelled at them on Wednesday night, strolling past the Championship without getting out of second gear.

However, Koeman has more unwanted questions to find answers to as the injury concerns pile-up for the Dutchman.

Morgan Schneiderlin missed Wednesday night's clash with an adductor injury that is expected to keep him out for the next four weeks.

And no sooner had the club confirmed the Frenchman's absence, they were facing up to a central midfield crisis after Victor Wanyama limped off on the stroke of half-time's with a hamstring injury.

With key defender Toby Alderweireld also due to miss the next four weeks with a hamstring strain, the injury problems are piling up for Koeman.

'The injuries are a big negative because we already have injuries. I spoke with Victor and [Steven] Davis and we said they would play 45 minutes each - if only Victor could hold on for 12 more seconds.

'Victor is a hamstring, so he will be out for four or five weeks.

'The problem we have is in our numbers. We have good youngsters but we don't want to put too much on them.

'We can handle it at the moment, but one or two more injuries we might have to look at it. I'll talk to the club.'

Tyrone Mings was released by Southampton aged 16 due to a ‘lack of physical development’. Six years later, the Ipswich defender is 6ft 5in and he came on to face his former club. 

On his side's display, Koeman added: 'I'm proud of them, it was a serious performance from us, it was difficult and a typical English cup game.'

Southampton, though, were handed an almighty fright inside the opening five minutes, Noel Hunt racing clear of the Saints backline to slide the ball under Fraser Forster, only for the effort to ruled offside.

But that was the highlight for the home side as Southampton cruised to victory after Shane Long finished off a good move involving Nathaniel Clyne, Dusan Tadic and James Ward-Prowse in the 19th minute.

The goal took the wind out of the Tractor Boys' sails. The intensity and exuberance of their early play vanished as the Premier League side asserted their authority with such ruthlessness. 

Ipswich rarely threatened Fraser Forster after Long's decisive striker as Southampton - led by the excellent Jose Fonte - nullified the home side's threat to set up a fourth round tie against Crystal Palace.

One chance, one goal. That's what happens in the Premier League - and Ipswich found out to their detriment.

A tame Darren Ambrose header was all Ipswich had to show for their second half performance, which was full of work-rate - but woefully short on quality.

'The game was a damp squib, we were okay until they scored and then they killed the game,' admitted Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy.

'We wanted it to be a rip roaring cup tie, but they didn't let it happen. They are a damn good side. There's no shame in losing to Southampton.'
