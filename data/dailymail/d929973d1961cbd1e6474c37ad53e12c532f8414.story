Everyone who owns a home worth £1 million or more will be targeted in  a new ‘anti-affluence’ crackdown by the Coalition.

A beefed-up squad of computer and legal experts will pore over their property, savings and income. If they think the individual is not paying enough tax, they will have the power to knock on their front door and force them to account for every penny.

The move is part of a tax-dodging purge on the rich forced through by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg.

Crackdown: Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander spoke to the Mail on Sunday

Fellow Lib Dem Danny Alexander, the Treasury Chief Secretary, who was accused of benefiting from a tax loophole on second homes, told The Mail on Sunday that the Coalition is to launch a triple-pronged attack on the well-off designed to raise hundreds of millions of pounds.

In an exclusive interview with this newspaper, Mr Alexander, one of the Coalition’s all-powerful ‘Quad’ with David Cameron, George Osborne and Mr Clegg, vowed to ‘sniff out’ wealthy tax cheats. ‘The measure will apply to people with homes and assets of more than £1 million,’ he said.

He denied it showed the Lib Dems were against successful hard-working people who made money, but insisted the well-off had to dig deeper to help clear the UK’s debts, saying: ‘The wealthiest did best in the boom years and it is right they should pay more now.’

He is boosting HM Revenue and Customs’ 200-strong Orwellian-sounding Affluence Unit, set up to probe 300,000 people worth more than £2.5 million – and widening its net.

The Affluence Unit’s strength will rise to 300 as its range is extended to include 500,000 people worth more than £1 million. Mr Alexander said: ‘We will use IT software to look across files and records and work out features in someone’s affairs that suggest there’s avoidance going on. They will look at anomalies and sniff out any problems.’

An HMRC source said it would ‘target affluent individuals owning offshore property’, develop a ‘serial avoiders unit’ to tackle avoidance, and ‘undertake a range of interventions to change the long-term behaviour of those using avoidance products’.

Mr Alexander said he and Mr Clegg would love to go further and impose a mansion tax on homes worth over £2 million, arguing it is the hardest kind of wealth tax to avoid. ‘You cannot dodge it – a home is not something you can shuffle off to Monaco,’ he said.

'Anti-affluence': Anybody who owns a home worth £1million or more will come under extra scrutiny

Mr Cameron has refused point blank to back the mansion tax, or a similar ‘tycoon tax’ put forward by Mr Clegg. As a result, the Lib Dems are threatening to refuse to support Tory plans for a new round of public spending cuts in another clash that threatens to wreck the Coalition.

However, some Tories may feel Mr Clegg has got round Mr Cameron by using the new probe into people with £1 million homes as a ‘back-door mansion tax’.

When it was pointed out that Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne would lose out from a mansion tax because they both own property worth well over £2 million, Mr Alexander – a lowly press officer with Cairngorm National Parks before he became an MP and Mr Osborne’s deputy – declared: ‘Well I don’t!’

'The measures will apply to people with homes and assets of more than £1m'

Asked how much he is worth, he replied: ‘I have a two-bedroom flat in London worth £300,000 to £400,000 and a home in Scotland worth a bit less.’

He did not conceal tensions in the Coalition over the Lib Dem ‘squeeze the rich’ tax crackdown, saying pointedly: ‘George Osborne is always saying, “We’re all in this together”.’

Critics are bound to point out that Mr Alexander was at the centre of a tax furore of his own in the MPs’ expenses scandal.

Support: Mr Alexander's plan was reinforced by Nick Clegg at the Lib Dem conference in Brighton

He admitted using a loophole to legally avoid paying Capital Gains Tax by designating his London property as his second home for his MPs’ expenses – but described it to the HMRC as his main home.

Under his initiative, wealthy BBC stars could also receive a visit by HMRC investigators. He is furious at the Corporation’s failure to copy Whitehall’s lead in stopping top civil servants slashing their tax bill by being paid via a private company.

He has written to BBC boss Mr Entwistle demanding action. ‘The only part of the public sector that did not follow our example was the BBC,’ he said. ‘I will be writing to the new Director General saying BBC employees must be paid openly and transparently.’

The Corporation has admitted paying ‘up to 3,000’ actors, editors, make-up artists and other ‘craft staff’ through service companies – with 36 earning more than £100,000 – but has refused to reveal how many top names were paid this way.

Presenters Jeremy Paxman, Emily Maitlis and Fiona Bruce were reportedly among those who set up companies to channel their earnings.

Rich soccer stars will also have their tax affairs scrutinised. ‘I am not ascribing any particular moral characteristics to footballers,’ said Mr Alexander. ‘But experts will identify warning signs, make sure their tax affairs are in order and approach the individual and “have a conversation” if they aren’t.’

HMRC has already ‘had a conversation’ with several Premiership stars, leading them to be forced to pay up to £100,000 each in tax ‘fines’– and the number will rise with the new purge.

Mr Alexander’s plan was reinforced by Mr Clegg as he arrived at the Lib Dem conference in Brighton last night. He said: ‘It’s wrong that people on low and middle incomes who work hard and play by the rules are taxed so much while Russian oligarchs pay the same council tax as some do on a family home.’
