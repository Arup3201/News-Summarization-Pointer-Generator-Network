On trial: Robert Major, 63, is on trial at Aylesbury Crown Court charged with child sex offences involving a father and his son

A scout master who molested a teenager 30 years ago and went on to abuse the man’s son was today starting a 14-year jail sentence.

Robert Major's copycat crimes were only exposed when the latest victim told his father he had been abused by the now 63-year-old.

The horrified father then revealed his own secret which he had kept bottled-up for three decades.

Today the jury found Major guilty of 17 of the 18 charges involving the two men and one other.

Aylesbury Crown court heard that Major had been a supervisor at a leisure centre swimming pool in the 1970s when he took advantage of the then schoolboy.

He had offered the 11-year-old free swimming sessions before manipulating him into participating in sexual acts in return, it was claimed.

In a bizarre twist, the police discovered the historic sexual abuse case on the victim, now 45, when his son came forward alleging sexual assaults by the same man in the late 1990s.

Police interviewed the father and were shocked to find he had also suffered at the hands of Major 30 years previously, said prosecutor Mary Loram.

She told the court the son, now 27, took 11 years to pluck up the courage to tell his parents and police of his shocking ordeal.

She said Major offered him cigarettes and alcohol and let him watch porn at his flat in exchange for sexual favours.

This, said Ms Loram, was a mirror image of what his father - who had suppressed the abuse for four decades - had been put through at the hands of Major.

He let the father swim at the Tiddenfoot Leisure Centre, in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, free of charge in return for sexual encounters in the shower room, bar area and changing rooms, it was claimed.

The jury heard that Major had been a Scout leader in Leighton Buzzard from the 1960s to the 1980s as well as holding a role as supervisor at the local swimming baths.

Ms Loram said: 'The son told his parents in 2009 that the defendant had done things to him sexually.

'Despite support from his parents he didn’t want to go to police at the time but his dad did want to do something about it and contacted police.

'It wasn’t until 2010 that he gave an account to police. Officers went to speak to his parents and his dad was interviewed.

'He (the father) went on to tell police how he knew Robert Major and how he went to the leisure centre as a teenager every day.

'The defendant worked at the pool and would let him into the pool free of charge. He told police how he went to the defendant’s flat and watched a soft porn film with him.

'Once he started looking back at what had happened all that time ago it all came out.'

The prosecutor added the pair performed sex acts on each other in the bar area of the leisure centre when it was empty, the showers, changing room and in the 'plant room' - an underground room which controlled the pool's temperature.

She added the acts also happened one time in the back of the defendant's Ford Cortina when it was parked outside the leisure centre.

The father told police he hadn’t thought about these things for 30 years, the court heard.

'Just like his son, he was made to feel this was normal and got cigarettes out of it. What teenager would say no to cigarettes, alcohol and porn?,' Ms Loram said.

Thirty years later, in a freak coincidence, Major continued his abusing ways with his former victim’s son,' the court heard.

This time it was at an address in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire in the late 1990s into the early 2000s when the boy was between 12 and 16 years.

Major denied eight counts of indecent assault, two counts of indecency with a child and one count of rape against the father between 1977 and 1981, as well as two counts of indecent assault, two counts of indecency with a child and one count of buggery against the son between 1998 and 2001, when he appeared at Aylesbury Crown Court, sitting at Amersham, Bucks.

He also denied two counts of indecent assault against another man dating back to the late 1970s and early 1980s.

The jury heard that Major had been a Scout leader in Leighton Buzzard from the 1960s to the 1980s as well as holding a role as supervisor at the local swimming baths.

The jury of seven men and five women took six hours and 55 minutes to return their verdicts.

Major, of Steppingstone Place, Leighton Buzzard, was found guilty on all counts except the rape of the father.

Judge Simon Davis, on sentencing Major to 14 years, said: 'It is difficult to put into words the damage that you have done to the family.

'You preyed upon these three adolescents between the ages of 10 to teenage years.

'You gave ready accommodation through occasional alcohol, but more often than not, money and sweets so that there was an enticement to people of that age to succumb to your perverted desires.

'Watching (the father’s) evidence it seems to me as it must have to the jury that there was a man who was struggling internally with extraordinary tensions.

'And then finding his son, who had been estranged for years who had returned to the fold, had been abused by you too.

'What was he to do? Keep it inside him which he had done for 30 years? Deal with it, pretending it never happened - the way in which some people deal with this? Or disclose it all?

'I can’t think of a worse case of length of behaviour, type of behaviour and impact. And the fact they were willing participants is not mitigating at all.

'That’s what people like you do. They pick their target and abuse their target.'

Major was put on the sex register for life, disqualified from working with children and given a Sexual Offences Prevention Order banning him from being alone with children under 16 years.
