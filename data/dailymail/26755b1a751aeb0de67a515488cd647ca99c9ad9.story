Ripped jeans are all the rage this season but have you ever considered how they were made?

One company is shunning factory workers and seamstresses in favour of wild animals.

Zoo Jeans, which claim its jeans are the only ones on earth designed by dangerous animals, take the animals' favourite playthings - old tires and giant rubber balls - and wrap them in sheets of denim.

Animal behaviour: A new jean company called Zoo Jeans takes the animals' favourite playthings - old tires and giant rubber balls - and wrap them in sheets of denim for the lions, bears and tigers to play with

They then return them to the animals, who roar, gnaw and claw at the toys. When the animals are done, the team scoop up the remains and make the jeans using the fabric, which feature a distressed denim look that is totally unique and comes with a built-in story telling the purchaser how - and by which animal - they were made.

Zoo Jeans is the brainchild of the Mineko Club volunteer group of zoo supporters launched in collaboration with Kamine Zoo in Hitachi City with the goal of reviving the local zoo.

As of this week,  three pairs of jeans - two created by lions 
and one by a tiger - will be auctioned to the highest bidders on Japan's Yahoo Auctions.

The 
proceeds will go to the Kamine Zooâ€™s wildlife preservation efforts and 
the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).

As well as raising money for animal charities, the practice is believed to be great for their welfare.

Robert J Young, a professor of Wildlife Preservation at the University of Salford, calls this environmental enrichment, which he describes as 'a simple and effective means of improving animal welfare in any species - companion, farm, laboratory and zoo'.

Speaking about the concept, fashion writer Simon Glazin said: 'I can't work out if this is uber genius or just screams of exploitation. I mean, I don't agree with zoos anyway - but if this Japanese zoo is going to keep these big cats, then this is one way to keep them occupied AND make fashion out of it!

'I also wonder if they treat the jeans after they've been mauled by the animals. No one wants to catch something from their couture!'

Dr Ros Clubb, senior scientific officer at the RSPCA, said:'We believe animals should only be kept in captivity if good welfare can be assured.

'Providing well-planned, varied, imaginative environmental enrichment should be part of all animal husbandry programmes in zoos, as is providing a suitable, species-appropriate environment that provides for the animals' needs.

'As long as it's safe for the animals, such as using non-toxic materials, then this could well be beneficial for the animals, stimulating natural behaviours and occupying the animals' time.'
