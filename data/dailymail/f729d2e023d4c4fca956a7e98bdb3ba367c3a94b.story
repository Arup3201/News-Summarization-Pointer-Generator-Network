James Harden has become the talk of the NBA  after a stunning season with the Houston Rockets and the shooting guard enhanced his reputation further with another display of brilliance - this time against the Denver Nuggets.

The 25-year-old scored a career-high 50 points with 10 rebounds to lead Houston to a 118-108 win over the Denver Nuggets on Thursday night.

It was the first time that a member from the Rockets team had scored 50 or more points since Hakeem Olajuwon achieved the feat 19 years ago.

Harden eclipsed his previous career-best of 46, set in 2013, on a free throw with about a minute remaining.

On Houston's next possession, Trevor Ariza found him in the corner for a three-pointer to take his tally to 50.

The impressive feat strengthened his case for MVP in a tight three-way battle between himself, Stephen Curry and LeBron James.

It was the 29th game Harden had scored at least 30 points this season and his career-high were commended on Twitter.

'Fear the Beard! James Harden scores a career-high 50 points (and grabs 10 boards) in Houston's 118-108 win vs. Denver,' wrote Bleacher Report.

'With The Dream in attendance, Harden dropped the first 50+ point game by a Rocket since Hakeem [Olajuwon] had 51 on 1/18/1996. #MVP,' Rockets' official account wrote.

CBS Sports astutely noted Harden outscored the whole of the Texas Longhorns, who lost 56-48 to the Butler Bulldogs in the NCAA tournament earlier in the day, by tweeting: 'James Harden outscored the University of Texas today.'

Harden will be looking to lead Kevin McHale's side to victory in their next match against the Phoenix Suns on Sunday.
