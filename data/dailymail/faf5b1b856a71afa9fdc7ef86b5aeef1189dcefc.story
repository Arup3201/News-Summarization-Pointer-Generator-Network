He’s the 7-foot son of a Melbourne car mechanic who made it big in the US after he became the first Australian player to be drafted number one overall in the NBA.

His skills on the court have not only landed the 30-year-old a place on Californian basketball team the Golden State Warriors but a $14 million-a-year salary to play with.

So what does Andrew Bogut spend his cash on?

Bogut, who was born to Croatian immigrants Mišo and Ankica and grew up in the Melbourne suburb of Endeavour Hills, now lives in a luxurious home in Walnut Creek, California, which he paid for straight-up.

He told sport’s website ESPN his most expensive habit is his passion for muscle cars.

Bogut said his most prized possession is his '69 Ford Mustang Boss 429, as part of his huge car collection that includes ‘about six in the States, about 10 in Australia’.

‘They're older, muscle, antique-type cars. I don't buy new Bentleys and that kind of c**p,’ he told ESPN.

'Good to come home from the road trip to this,' Bogut said of his vintage Camaro car

Andrew Bogut wrote on Twitter: 'Good to have #blackfalcon over for some billards. Notice how many of @hbarnes stripes are left on the table?  #ouch'. He bought the table for $225

He claims to spend roughly $2,000 a week on expenses such as food and drink, transport and shopping – including feeding his two Siberian husky dogs.

In October, he had a new $225 billiard table installed in his house and told ESPN: ‘The table weighs like 600 pounds­ - it took two or three guys to take it out of storage and put it together in the living room. I'll happily cough up the cash instead of hurting my back.’

Bogut grew up in Melbourne playing AFL and tennis in addition to basketball.

At 15-years-old he was cut from the Victoria junior state representative team but he did not give up on his dreams and later went on to attend the Australian Institute of Sport.

He  led the Australian team that won the 2003 FIBA Junior World Championships before moving to Salt Lake City in Utah to play college basketball in the States, going on to begin his successful and lucrative NBA career.

Last year, Bogut revealed how he finds it hard to let new people close to him because he worries about their possible ulterior motives.

'Unpacking some boxes and came across some old photos! My very first car! #Lplates #VRBerlina,' Bogut wrote on Twitter

'Glad I got these babies through customs coming back from China! #childhooddream,' he wrote alongside a photo of some nunchucks 

He told the Herald Sun: 'The last thing I want to do is lose all my money, everything I worked hard for.

'Unfortunately for me there is more bad because what I make is public and, where money is involved, the bad people come out. 

'Everyone knows what I earn, so everyone sees me as a walking dollar sign.'

Back home in Australia, Bogut has used some of his earnings to develop a basketball academy in his Carrum Downs, Melbourne.

The Andrew Bogut Basketball Academy, which opened in 2011, is open to Juniors currently playing representative basketball from Under 12 to Under 20 age groups.
