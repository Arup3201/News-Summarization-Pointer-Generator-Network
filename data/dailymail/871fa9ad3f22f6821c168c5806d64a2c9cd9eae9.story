Eric Pickles, Communities Secretary, said every new home should have a hiding place for a wheelie bin to stop streets being blighted by 'ugly clutter'

Every new home should have a hiding place for a wheelie bin to stop streets being blighted by ‘ugly clutter’, Eric Pickles said yesterday.

The Local Government Secretary called for ‘bin-tidy’ spaces to be built into the front of houses and flats, or for space to be made available for bins in the back yard.

Building and planning regulations will demand that housing designers include space for ‘proper waste storage’ in new properties, Mr Pickles said.

His bid to reduce ‘bin blight’ is the latest attempt to soften the impact of a Whitehall-driven move towards compulsory recycling. 

Millions of homes have been issued with wheelie bins, often in areas where there is nowhere to store them. Mr Pickles said he was ‘getting rid of barmy bin policies which made families’ lives hell.’ 

He added: ‘I want to make sure families get a proper rubbish and recycling collection service for the large amount of money they have to pay in council tax.

‘Thanks to ill-thought out town hall policies from the last government, badly-placed wheelie bins and the proliferation of multiple bins have created a blot on the landscape. 

‘In streets up and down the country, ugly bin clutter has ruined the street scene and the look of people’s homes and gardens. By ensuring that developers create appropriate waste storage areas when designing new homes, we can tackle the ghastly gauntlet of bin-blighted streets and driveways.’

Mr Pickles, who once said it was the basic right of an Englishman to put chicken tikka masala in his bin without having to wait a fortnight for it to be collected, was the driving force behind a £250million fund to encourage councils to bring back weekly rubbish collections.

Research has shown the initiative failed to restore weekly bin rounds, but did support councils that had chosen to keep them.

The Communities and Local Government Department has published new clauses for planning and design guidance which say every new home should have space for all the bins demanded by the local council.

A consultation on housing standards to be published next week will say: ‘The Government places a high degree of importance in ensuring that suitable provision is made for waste storage in new homes, particularly to avoid bins dominating street frontages or contributing to increased levels of anti-social nuisance such as odour or litter. 

‘This is sometimes referred to as bin blight, and the Government intends to bring this to an end.’ 

The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said this week the average amount recycled by individuals in England fell for the first time in 30 years last year.
