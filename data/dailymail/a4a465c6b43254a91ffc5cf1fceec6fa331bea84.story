Nearly half of high-flying 11-year-olds fail to go on to get five good GCSEs in core subjects, secondary school league tables show.

Of the 160,000 pupils who gained good SATs results when they left primary school,  84,000 failed to achieve a C-grade or higher in the ‘English Baccalaureate’ subjects of English, maths, science, history or geography and a language.

The figures will reignite the debate about mixed-ability classes which Labour and the Conservatives have both pledged to crack down on since 1997. Critics say the lack of sets and streams in schools holds back the most able students.

Almost half of academic 11-year-olds fail to get five or more C grade GSCEs in academic subjects

Some 420 schools or sixth form  
colleges were also unable to produce a single student who gained three  
A-levels with grades of AAB or above in subjects preferred by leading 
universities.

The worrying trends emerged in official figures which 
showed the number of under-performing schools has been slashed since the
 Coalition took power.

Of 
the 3,200 state schools in  England, 154 fell short of a government 
target for at least 40 per cent of pupils to get five good passes in 
GCSEs including English and maths – leaving them at risk of being closed
 or converted into academies.

But
 the figure was 61 fewer than the previous year, despite the benchmark 
being raised from 35 per cent of pupils. The improvement means 50,000 
fewer children are trapped in sub-standard secondaries compared to last 
year, or 244,000 since 2010.

Education
 Secretary Michael Gove said the results were a ‘credit to the 
professionalism and hard work of teachers’. Tony Blair effectively 
admitted mixed-ability teaching was a failure when he dropped the  
party’s historic support for the  practice in 1997.

Education
 ministers backed the line, saying separating pupils according to 
ability would ‘raise standards’. David Cameron also called for changes 
while in opposition, saying every comprehensive should have a ‘grammar 
stream’.

But inspectors at 
the schools watchdog have found just 46 per cent of state school classes
 are divided into sets or streams – only a one percentage point 
improvement in 17 years.

Tory
 MP Graham Brady, who  supports selective education, said: ‘All of the 
evidence indicates that teaching by ability works best. That’s true 
whether it’s within a school through sets or streaming or between 
schools as a selective system.’

The
 league tables are based on data provided by the Department for 
Education and show how more than 4,000 schools and colleges in England 
performed at GCSEs, A-levels and other academic qualifications.

The
 top-performing school for GCSEs was co-educational Colyton Grammar 
School in Devon, which had the best results for the second year in a 
row.

The figure is 61 less than last year - an achievement Education Secretary Michael Gove said was a 'credit to hard work of teachers'

The analysis also 
showed that 202,000 pupils were entered for the EBacc compared to 
130,000 in 2012, showing schools are heeding government calls to ditch 
soft subjects such as drama and sociology for those better suited to 
higher education and the jobs markets.

Teachers’
 unions dislike league tables because they claim they do not accurately 
show how a school is performing and encourage staff to ‘teach to the 
test’.

But Simon Burgess, 
professor of economics at the University of  Bristol, said: ‘League 
tables play an important role in school standards. Removing league 
tables reduces average school performance and raises inequality in 
attainment.’
