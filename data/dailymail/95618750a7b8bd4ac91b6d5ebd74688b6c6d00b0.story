Former NYPD commissioner Bernard Kerik has accused his former attorney of working with federal agents to put him behind bars in 2010 for taking bribes from mobsters.

Kerik, a 9/11 hero, was one of the city's most beloved commissioners and on track to be the head of Homeland Security but that changed the day he plead guilty to accepting $165,000 in apartment renovations from the mob-connected DiTommaso family who wanted a city contract.

He hired high-profile lawyer and personal friend Joe Tacopina to represent him but by the time the case made it to court, his attorney was serving as a witness for the prosecution.

Kerik served four years of prison time in Maryland and was released this past May seemingly hell bent on vengence since he filed a bar complaint against Tacopina Friday.

In the complaint, Kerik accuses Tacopina of engaging in 'conduct involving dishonest, fraud, deceit, and/or misrepresentation' in addition to several legal abuses.

He says that Tacopina met with federeal prosecutors behind his back, giving them information that would help bring him down.

Additionally Tacopina put Kerik in danger of being arrested by contacting him after it was announced that he would be on the witness list.

Kerik also accuses Tacopina of attempting to defraud him of a seven-figure finder's fee in a real estate transaction.

Following the new complaint, Tacopina shot back at Kerik in the New York Post calling the allegations unsubstantiated old news.

'This is such bulls***, reheated dog food,' Tacopina said.

Tacopina's attorney was a little less candid with his denials.

'If any of these allegations were true, Mr Tacopina would have at least been subjected to discipline,' Washington-based attorney Lanny Davis said in a statement to the New York Daily News.

'Yet Mr Tacopina in 22 years of law practice has never received a bar complaint, let alone any discipline. Mr Tacopina's spotless record with the bar speaks far louder than the lies and innuendo that are being spread by those with an obvious agenda.'

Tacopina is currently representing Yankee star Alex Rodriguez as he attempts to get his 211-game ban for testing positive for steroid use reduced.

Boston attorney Raymond Mansolillo is representing Kerik in the bar case, and says his client may also file a malpractice suit against Tacopina.

'We'll assess the information that we've gleaned and we'll determine which avenue to take. I'm looking into whether any (of Tacopina's representation) had any direct effect on where Bernie ended up.'Â
