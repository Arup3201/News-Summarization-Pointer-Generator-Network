David Cameron risked a row with the Tory Right last night after ignoring calls to help middle-class voters hit by the 40p tax rate.

In a major speech on the economy, the Prime Minister promised that further savings from public spending would be used to fund tax cuts.

But Mr Cameron, who confirmed the Government would accept a rise in the minimum wage to £6.50 an hour, appeared to indicate that any future tax cuts would be targeted at the low-paid.

He made no reference to raising the starting point for paying 40p tax, which is emerging as a key Budget demand among Conservative MPs.

Senior Tories are pushing for the tax threshold to be raised from £41,450 to £44,000 to ease the pain on higher earners.

Kwasi Kwarteng, a member of the Tory Free Enterprise Group, last night urged the Prime Minister to ensure that any tax cuts are shared by middle-class voters as well as the low-paid.

Mr Kwarteng said: ‘We need to do something about the 40p tax rate as well. People on £42,000 cannot be described as wealthy, particularly if they are trying to bring up a family in the South East. We need to help these strivers, who are doing the right thing, to get on.

‘The current threshold sends out a bizarre message. If you earn £42,000 you start paying 40 per cent tax, but you have to earn £35,000 to earn the equivalent of the Government’s benefits cap. That gap is far too narrow.’

In May 2010, the month that the Coalition was formed, a worker became a higher rate taxpayer when their salary hit £43,875.

But Chancellor George Osborne has repeatedly lowered, or frozen, the level at which a worker starts to pay tax at 40 per cent.

Today you are a higher rate taxpayer if you are paid £41,450.

The ‘starting salary’ will barely rise for the next two years, increasing  by just 1 per cent a year to £41,865 in April this year and £42,285 in April 2015, according to the Government’s figures.

Traditionally, it would have been increased at a far more generous rate, rising in line with inflation, but the Chancellor scrapped this plan.

Accountants Grant Thornton estimate that this so-called ‘fiscal drag’ will see 4.6million people paying 40p tax by the time of next year’s General Election, up from 3million in 2010.

Mike Warburton, the firm’s senior tax partner, warned: ‘It is no longer only the rich who are drawn into paying higher rate tax.’

He said recent tax changes have been ‘too harsh on the squeezed middle’, catching people who do not consider themselves well-off, such as teachers, senior nurses and middle managers.

Mr Cameron, who has made clear his desire to cut taxes if the Conservatives win power outright in 2015, yesterday said that security came from ‘having more money in our pockets’.

But Nick Clegg accused the Prime Minister of having a ‘brass neck’ by posing as a champion of tax cuts.

The Deputy Prime Minister claimed that the Tories had initially opposed Coalition plans to raise the starting threshold for paying tax to £10,000.

But Mr Cameron also used his speech in Coventry to attack Labour’s economic plans, warning that more borrowing would leave the next generation ‘crippled with our debt’.

He also took a swipe at both Labour and church leaders who have criticised the Government’s welfare reforms, saying ministers had a duty to tackle the ‘failure’ of the welfare state that left five million people on out-of-work benefits at the height of the boom in the last decade.

‘I don’t care whether you are the leader of the Labour Party or the leader of the church, this kind of failure is just wrong,’ he said.

‘It’s wrong to let our own people do nothing, with no purpose in their lives, dependent on benefits.

‘It’s wrong to let our own people do nothing, with no purpose in their lives, dependent on benefits. It’s wrong that we open our doors and communities to such rapid levels that they can’t manage.

‘And wrong that we ask British taxpayers to fund this situation with their hard-earned money.’
