It was the Hollywood Hills hideaway of Charlie Chaplin before The Maltese Falcon actress Mary Astor shared it with her famously controlling parents.

Now former Saturday Night Live star Andy Samberg and his new wife Joanna Newsom have made the opulent 'Moorcrest' mansion their love nest, splashing out $6.25 million in a secret off-market deal in April.Â 

The loved-up couple managed to snag the spectacular four-bedroom, 
six-bathroom home in Los Angeles' Beachwood Canyon well below the asking price.

The comedian and 'Brooklyn Nine-Nine' star tied the knot with longtime girlfriend Newsom, a musician, in a lavish Big Sur ceremony in September last year.

Extravagant purchase: Andy Samberg and his wife Joanna Newsom have purchased Moorcrest, the famous 1920s Moorish Gothic mansion in Los Angeles' Beachwood Canyon, for $6.25 million in an off-market deal

The 6,432-square-foot gated estate was designed by philosophical architect Marie Russak Hotchener and 
built in 1921, combining Moorish, Gothic and Art Nouveau 
architectural influences to striking effect.

With incredible views of the Hollywood sign, the residence has recently been restored to its elaborate glory with stained-glass windows, marble baseboards, 
hand-painted frescos and elaborate mosaic tiles.

The atrium's glassed dome ceiling floods the ivy-covered abode with sunlight, illuminating the painstakingly detailed patterns on the walls and ceilings. Outside, a curved swimming pool is surrounded by a man-made cave and stepping-stone path.

Chaplin rented the magnificent Temple Hill Drive property in the early 1920s, while actress Astor bought the estate in 1925 and lived there with her obsessively controlling parents, Otto and Helen Langhanke, for nearly a decade before she married.

According to Zillow, the lavish property last sold in 1999 for $900,000. In 2007, it was listed for sale for $7.4 million but there were no takers and the listing was removed.

Zillow states the home was sold on April 4 this year, however LA Times reports the sale was finalized in late March.
