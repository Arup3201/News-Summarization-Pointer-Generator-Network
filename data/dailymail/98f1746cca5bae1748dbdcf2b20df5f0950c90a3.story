Dragana Haines (pictured) has backed military force against IS extremists but said changes in such societies 'have to come from within' 

The widow of murdered British aid worker David Haines has backed military force against Islamic State extremists.  

Dragana  Haines said the 'tragic event' had changed her life and altered the 'perception of most free thinking people around the world.'  

Mrs Haines told Sky News: 'The recent tragic event has changed my life as well as the lives and perception of most free thinking people around the world.

'I do support British military air strikes but limited to distinctive targets. No changes in such societies can be enforced, they have to come from within.'

Her support for air strikes comes after Mr Haines’ daughter Bethany called for IS to be 'eradicated.'  

David Haines, 44, from Perth in Scotland, had been in Syria working for French aid agency ACTED when he was kidnapped. 

His daughter Bethany, 17, has backed the use of military force against the terror group that used her 'truly amazing' father's life to send a grisly warning to its enemies.

She said: 'IS need to be eradicated. They can't continue this way. They can't be doing this to people and get away with it.

'No matter what nationality, if they are Western or not. Hundreds of Syrians have been killed by them. They need to be stopped. If airstrikes and ground force is what it takes, that's what it takes.' 

Her comments come as David Cameron held a War Cabinet yesterday on the Government's plan to target Islamist fighters in northern Iraq and received its backing.

MPs will vote around 5pm this evening on a Commons motion authorising British involvement in US-led bombing raids. It means RAF fighter jets could be over Iraq within hours of the vote.

In her exclusive interview with ITV News, Miss Haines also paid tribute to the selflessness of her father, and spoke of her desire to follow him into aid work.

'He wanted to help everyone,' she said.

'It didn't matter what race or religion. Anyone who needed help he was there. Tragically he's lost his life doing what he loved but he wouldn't have stopped.

'Even if he'd come back after this he would've gone out again and again and again. He loved helping people. He was such a bright character. Always making people laugh, telling jokes.

'He was a brilliant man. And he will remembered like that by everyone who knew him and probably by people who didn't know him.

'He will be remembered and not for the way he was shown in that video, but for the truly amazing work he did and the bright character he was.'

The teenager says her father's fate hasn't put her off helping others.

She said: 'I'm hoping to do some aid work after next year and do a bit of work with a charity. Hopefully it will spark a career doing that. He'd tell me of all the people he'd helped and I want to do that too.'

Miss Haines confirms that her father's body has not been returned to them, saying: 'No, we've not had a body. I don't know if they are trying to prolong the pain or they don't feel they need to, but as a daughter of someone who has been killed, you want closure.

'As a family you want closure. They have tried to hurt us by taking away someone we loved but they have failed. Because everyone who knows David will have a part of him with us forever.

'I know my dad would have been very touched and moved by the amount of concern, support and supportive messages people have been giving to us.'

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon has warned that the air campaign against ISIS in Iraq was for a 'long haul' of 'two of three years' at least. Mr Cameron's official spokesman later admitted the action could take a 'very considerable time'.

It came after the Iraqi government revealed that it had received 'credible' intelligence that ISIS militants are planning to launch attacks on subway systems in Paris and New York. 

The video of his death provoked outrage, with Prime Minister David Cameron calling Mr Haines a 'British hero', dedicating his life to promoting peace in places of violent conflict and oversaw projects to save civilians from land mines.
