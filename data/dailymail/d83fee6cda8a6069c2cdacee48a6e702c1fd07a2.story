This is the moment a cautious driver holds up a busy London street while doing a seven-point turn in his £294,665 Lamborghini Aventador supercar.

The motorist, spent almost one minute edging his 217mph car forward and backwards as he attempted to turn around in South Kensington in London. 

The display was captured on the dashboard camera of by a taxi driver who was held up by the display.

The driver carefully edges the 217mph super car between the kerbs despite the annoyance of other motorists

The footage was captured by taxi driver Chris Kareban who said: 'Owners of supercars in London usually drive slowly as they want to show off their "toys". I have noticed new crazy driving styles too.'

The Lamborghini Aventador features a sophisticated all-wheel drive system which delivers the 700bhp produced by the 6.5litre V12 engine to all four wheels to increase grip and make it safer to drive. 

Luckily for the driver concerned, the car also comes as standard with power steering as well as parking sensors.  

The Aventador's massive engine is placed behind the driver's cabin, over the rear wheels to produce the ultimate weight balance. 

However, even though the driver took seven attempts to turn in the road, he would not have automatically failed his driving test.  

The driver consciously avoids getting too close to the pavement in case he damages his expensive bodywork 

The Aventador can hit 60mph in less than three seconds and is capable of reaching 217mph on a race track

Peter Rodger, chief examiner of the Institute of Advanced Motorists said it was understandable why the driver appeared to have some difficulty in turning his car. 

'The Aventador has a particularly large footprint on the road and it is fairly clear that the driver isn't exactly certain where the front of the car ends. 

UK list price: £294,665

Engine: 6.5 litre V12

Power: 700bhp at 8,250 rpm

Fuel efficiency: 16.4mpg combined

0-60mph: 2.9 seconds

Top speed: 217mph

Transmission: 7-speed semi-automatic all wheel drive 

'It is also very low, so I guess the driver did not want to touch the kerb as repairing the carbon fibre bodywork would be quite expensive. 

'I would expect that controlling the clutch during such a delicate manoeuvre could be tricky as well.' 

'It is better to take an extra shunt than to hit something. Although the driver could have considered finding an alternative place to turn in a less busy location.' 

Mr Rodger, who has more than 40 years' driving experience said that there is a common misconception among motorists with the three-point turn. 

'It has been called the three-point turn since before I started driving. But the examiner will ask you to turn in the road using forward and reverse gears. The examiner will be looking to see if you have the car under control at all times and are keeping an adequate look out. The driver has to make adequate progress but you wouldn't automatically fail with seven turns. In that car it would be difficult to complete the manoeuvre in less than five.

'I don' think the Aventador would be a good car for doing the driving test as the examiner would have difficulty seeing out, so it might not be an acceptable vehicle.' 

Eventually after almost a minute, the Aventador squeezes past a taxi who is busily searching for a fare
