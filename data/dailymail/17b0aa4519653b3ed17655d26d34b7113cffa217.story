For years it was a no-go zone, locked in diplomatic disputes with the United States, which it famously decried as 'The Great Satan'.

But now Iran, which sparked one of the 20th Century's tensest diplomatic stand-off by taking 52 Americans hostage, is once more a popular tourist spot.

Tehran, the vibrant capital, is the final destination of a new luxury train trip from Europe to the Middle East, which also takes in Persian ruin sites like Isfahan and Persepolis.

And, according to the Golden Eagle Luxury Trains company, which has just launched its Jewels of Persia service, a substantial chunk of its customers are from the U.S.

The train journey, which costs around $40,000 per passenger, takes a 14-day journey from Budapest, Hungary, through eastern Europe, Turkey and into Iran.

Speaking to NBC News, one customer from Kansas said her family think she is 'absolutely nuts'. She said: 'There is no reason not to come to Iran, don't let what is perceived to keep you home.'

The nation - full name the Islamic Republic of Iran - is run by a council of clerics, and has long been subject to crippling economic sanctions from the United States.

In 1979 relations between the two nations hit an all-time low when a group of Iranian students took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, holding 52 Americans captive for 44 days. 

The rescue of group of U.S. citizens was recently made into the Hollywood blockbuster Argo, which starred Ben Affleck as a CIA agent who helped smuggle the Americans out of Iran and back to the United States.

As a result many may still believe Iran to be a perilous place to visit, but not so, says Tim Littler, the founder of tour operator Golden Eagle.

'We had more problems in Russia when we started 25 years ago,' Little said. 

'We went into areas where people were literally starving and we arrived in an opulent train full of caviar and sturgeon and fine wines.'

In an attempt to make tourists feel safer, the Iranian government, which has announced it would spend heavily to develop its tourism industry, said it would put military marshals on the train.  

The tickets for the first Golden Eagle train voyage sold out in 10 days.

Of the 109 passengers who traveled on the east or westbound legs of the two-week journey, 26 were American citizens. 

Bahman Zenhari, a marketing executive with Iranian tour operator Pasargad Tours, told NBC there had been a 350 percent increase for tour demands in Iran since last year's election, in which President Hassan Rouhani replaced the outspoken Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who consistently outraged the Jewish community by repeatedly calling the Holocaust a lie.

'When American tourists first came to Iran they would tell locals that they were Canadian, but not today,' Bahrain told the network.

Among the major must-sees is the holy city of Mashdad, Iran's second-biggest city after Tehran, and the central city of Isfahan, considered one of the most beautiful places in the world for its hand-painted tiling and magnifcant public square.

However, while Iran may have become safer and more popular, the cultural differences are still very exacting.

As per Muslim faith, all women are expected to wear headscarves, which can easily deter - and sometimes frighten - tourists. 

Houston man Joseph Cheavens and his wife were not so worried, though, taking the Golden Eagle Danube Express train for a vacation together, much to the shock of their friends at home.

'I just had an email before I left from a business colleague saying, ''You are going to a dangerous part of the world'',' he told NBC.

'Well, it's not dangerous.'
