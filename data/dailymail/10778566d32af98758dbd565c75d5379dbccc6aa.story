Sportsmail's Jason Robinson, a former Wigan and England rugby union legend, previews Saturday's Super League Grand Final between arch rivals St Helens and Wigan. 

The rivalry

I played in the 1998 Grand Final and I know just how fierce the rivalry is. You can be a Kiwi, Australian or Yorkshireman coming into those teams but very quickly you get drawn into the ‘we hate the local enemy’ mentality.

You’ve got two strands to the game. It is probably the game of the season with the biggest prize at stake and it’s also an intense local rivalry.

Captains – Paul Wellens v Sean O’Loughlin

Paul is a stalwart of the game, playing in his tenth Grand Final. He is the eyes from the back. He can see where the attacks are coming from and he’ll be barking at the guys all game to make sure they get up and shut Wigan down.

Sean is almost like a coach on the field. He can execute game changing passes when the pressure is on and when things don’t go their way, he has the experience to calm the troops and put plan b into action. He will be talking to the younger players and making sure their mindset is right.

Coaches – Shaun Wane v Nathan Brown

Shaun is a born-and-bred Wiganer so he knows the importance of winning this game to the town. He certainly doesn’t mince his words. He wants honesty from his players and if he doesn’t get performances he drops them.

Wigan's Shane Wane (L) is a no-nonsense coach while Nathan Brown has coped well with St Helens injuries

Nathan has faced season ending injuries to three of his key players – Jon Wilkin, Luke Walsh and Jonny Lomax. They’re players who make the team tick. The fact he’s been able to adjust midway through the season marks him out as a special coach.

VERDICT – I believe Wigan have the edge because of their experience and power.
