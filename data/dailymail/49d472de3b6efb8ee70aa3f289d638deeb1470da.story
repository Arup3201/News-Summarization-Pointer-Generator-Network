A woman has claimed that Covergirl's two-step Bombshell Volume mascara is so hard to get off, it caused her to lose a significant clump of eyelashes in trying.

'I was wiping downward with the cotton ball and noticed a chunk of my eyelashes fell into the palm of my hand', Amy Schavolt, 21, based in West Palm Beach, Florida, tells ABC15.

Ms Schavolt was initially impressed with the dramatic results she achieved from the mascara, which Covergirl boasts delivers 'ten times more noticeable lashes vs. bare lashes'.

Noticeable indeed! Amy Schavolt claims Covergirl's Bombshell Volume mascara was so hard to get off - even with make-up remover - that she wrenched out a sizable clump of her lashes in trying (pictured)

Product fail: Ms Schavolt (pictured) says she was initially impressed with the bold effects of the mascara, but it quickly turned into a 'clumpy, gooey mess' before it caused her lashes to fall out

'I had a couple of people say "wow your eyelashes look really nice" and I was all excited', she says, insisting that she applied the product exactly as instructed; two layers of the 'extreme volume' base coat and two layers of the 'intensifying' top coat.

The product quickly transformed into a 'clumpy, gooey mess' however, and disaster struck when Ms Schavolt tried to remove the product with make-up remover.

Dr Alan Bauman, a specialist in repairing damaged eyelashes was shown photos of Ms Schavolt's missing clump and deemed her lashes 'traumatized'.

'Eyelashes can take some time to rebound. It can take like two to four months', he told the news outlet, advising consumers to be extra gentle when removing tough products like this one.

Alarmingly, Ms Schavolt is not the only one in her predicament. Plenty of other customers have made the same complaint in their reviews of Covergirl's Bombshell volume on the brand's own website.

'Dear God someone tell me how to get this mascara OFF!' writes one reviewer. 'WORST PURCHASE EVER! I'M PANICKING!'

'No amount of make-up remover would remove. Pulled out half of my lashes trying to get it off', another reads.

'As a former model, I always turned to Cover Girl cosmetics first when looking for make-up... It is extremely hard to remove and I lost clumps of my eyelashes trying!' rants yet another.

MailOnline counted 13 instances in which customers specifically reported lost lashes and the mascara currently has a two out five score on the website.

A statement Covergirl issued to Ms Schavolt reads: 'Covergirl Bombshell Mascara wears like a waterproof, and therefore it can be more difficult to remove than a regular mascara. We have performed extensive testing on the product to ensure its safety and effectiveness and significant lash fall out is not typical.'

The representative advised customers to remove it using an oil-based eye make-up remover and allow it sit on the lashes 'for about a minute' before 'gently' wiping it away. Countless reviewers however claim to have followed these instructions and still lost lashes.

Covergirl mailed Ms Schavolt a coupon for a future purpose, and it seems unlikely she will spend it on mascara - if she wants to keep the rest of her lashes, that is.
