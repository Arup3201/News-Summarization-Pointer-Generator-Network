A drunken man in East London staggers all over the footpath before clinging onto a railing for dear life in this video as some observers in a nearby house record him in his inebriated state.

The man, dressed in a red t-shirt and navy shorts, looks like he is trying to walk somewhere but every time he tries to walk forward he loses his balance and he has to hastily retreat and grab the railing.

At the start of  the video the man is having such difficulty walking up the footpath it looks like he is walking on black ice.  

One of the men who is recording the footage says: 'Oh he's going backwards, oh don't hit your head.'

On five occasions the man tries walking forward during the two minute video but each time he reaches a stage where his legs seem to take on a life of their own.

The revellers in the nearby house laugh incessantly as the drunken man fails to walk forward time and time again. 

One man sings mockingly, 'Cause I take one step forward and two steps back,' during one of the drunken individual's more spectacular unsuccessful attempts.

Moments later the drunken man clings to the railing once again and falls to his knees. 

Pensive: The man gathers his thoughts before he tries to walk forward 

Wobbly: As the man walks forward his legs start to wobble like jelly 

Balance: The inebriated man's balance is also very poor and he constantly loses his footing

Railing: The man constantly leans on the barrier as he uses it as a crutch to stay upright

Stumble: The man, who is trying to walk in East London, stumbles numerous times during the short video

Break: The man appears to take a break for a few moments at one stage while leaning on the railing

Quicksand: The man's ability to walk is so hazardous it looks like he is walking on quicksand at times

Sleep: The drunken man looks tired and he puts his head bag momentarily as he tries one last attempt
