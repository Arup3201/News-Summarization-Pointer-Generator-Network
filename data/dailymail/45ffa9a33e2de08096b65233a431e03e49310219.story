After winning the Super Bowl, Darrelle Revis is heading back to the New York Jets.

Two years after his acrimonious departure to Tampa Bay, the shutdown corner again showed his mastery of free agency, signing a vast five-year, $70million deal.

With $39m guaranteed, Revis will pocket $16m-a-season in the first three years, NFL insider Ian Raport reports.

At 29, the six-time Pro Bowler and four-time All-Pro is among a number of new additions as the Jets look to break their four-year spell without a play-off place.

Revis lasted a year with the Buccaneers after penning a six-year, $96m deal with no guaranteed money.

The Patriots moved swiftly following his release last year, with the parties agreeing on a $32m two-year deal.

Owner Robert Kraft declined to take up the $20m second-year option, opting to re-sign safety Devin McCourty on big money instead.

The deal appears a questionable one for the Super Bowl-winning Patriots.

Revis and the recently released Brandon Browner gave them a secondary that was the envy of the AFC. But they lose a locker room leader  to an AFC East rival and Bill Belichick has to rebuild his secondary once more. 

With $50m cap space, it has already been a busy free agency for Gang Green and new head coach Todd Bowles.

Alongside the marquee signing of Brandon Marshall, cornerback Buster Skrine joined from Cleveland, guard James Carpenter comes in from Seattle and linebacker David Harris was re-signed.
