Charles and Camilla may have been among the most high profile phone hacking victims, the police have warned Buckingham Palace.

Palace officials were approached by officers within recent days and told the royal couple may have been targeted by Glenn Mulcaire.

The names of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall are believed to have been included in an 11,000-page dossier kept by Mulcaire which was seized by Scotland Yard in 2006.

The Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall during their visit to a health centre in Devon today. The names of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall are believed to have been included in an 11,000-page dossier kept by Mulcaire which was seized by Scotland Yard in 2006.

The document, which is at the centre of the hacking scandal, names 4,000 people believed to be victims.

The new royal revelations came on a day in which a raft of accusations ensured that the scandal was deepening, rather than going away, as Rupert Murdoch would have hoped following the closure of NotW.

Gordon Brown is expected to wade into the row and allege that Murdoch's empire targeted his personal information and accessed his son's medical records, according to The Guardian.

An investigation discovered that a 'blagger' - thought to be a private detective - had posed as Mr Brown and gained bank details on behalf of the Sunday Times.

Charles and Camilla join at least eight other members of the royal household thought to have had their voicemail messages intercepted.

A Buckingham Palace source today told the Guardian: 'The question that has to be answered is, if somebody had access to this evidence back then, why didn't they do something about it?'

Scotland Yard made the revelations about Charles and Camilla in response to a Freedom of Information request by the Guardian.

Hacking row: Jeremy Hunt, left, told the House of Commons today he was referring News Corporation's bid to buy the remainder of shares in BSkyB to the Competition Commission. It also emerged that Glenn Mulcaire, right may have targeted Prince Charles and Camilla while phone hacking at the NotW

In 2007, the News of the World's former royal reporter Clive Goodman and private detective Glenn Mulcaire were jailed for intercepting messages from members of the royal household.

The revelation comes on the day that it emerged that the News of the World paid Royal Protection Officers for personal details about the Queen and other senior royals.

Detectives are investigating claims that sums of around Â£1,000 were offered to officers tasked with protecting the royals.

An email showed former royal editor Clive Goodman asked the paper's editor at the time Andy Coulson for cash to buy a confidential directory of royal phone numbers.

Goodman, 53, and Coulson, 43, have been arrested and bailed until October on suspicion of bribing police officers.

Princes William and Harry have also apparently been hacked by the News of the World, it has previously been revealed.

A minor story in the Sunday paper created the hacking storm when Clive Goodman wrote that William had damaged a tendon playing football.

Palace officials were baffled by how the story got out because so few people knew about it.

Today Rupert Murdoch's attempt to takeover BSkyB was tonight referred to the Competition Commission.

Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the House of Commons that the Commission would be able to consider 'all relevant recent developments' when it came to evaluating the proposed merger.

Mr Hunt told MPs he hoped the law 'shows no mercy' to those involved in phone hacking, including 'any managers who condoned such appalling behaviour'.
