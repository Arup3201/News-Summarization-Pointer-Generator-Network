A British holidaymaker racked up a staggering £20,000 mobile phone bill after she used her internet to upload holiday snaps to Facebook.

Shocked Helen Christie, 40, was landed with the massive bill, which is 28 times the amount she paid for her holiday, when she decided to share photos of her trip to Turkey on the social network.

But by using her Orange mobile internet to upload the pictures, she ran up data roaming charges which worked out at huge £2,700 per day.

Helen, of Woolwich, South East London, had planned for her trip by buying £6 per day 'travel saver' mobile internet bundle from her network provider.

But Orange said that by buying into the deal, she had opted out of the cap on her normal tariff, which limits internet charges to £42 per day.

Upon her return, the mother-of-two was faced with monthly repayments of £3,000.

Speaking to The Mirror, she said: "I just thought it might be nice to put a few pictures on Facebook. I didn't have a clue what on earth had gone on.

"I thought it was a wind-up. The whole holiday only cost me £700. It's disgusting. It's scare tactics - people don't realise what these companies are doing."

After a national newspaper contacted Orange, they agreed to cut the bill from £19,656 to £875 because of 'exceptional circumstances'

A spokesperson for Orange said: "The customer used much more data than her chosen bundle. Due to the exceptional circumstances we have offered a significant reduction."

Fearing pressure from Bailiffs, Helen who earns £10,000 per year as an accounts manager, said she plans to fight the revised bill in court.

The row comes with the Eurpoean Commission hoping to scrap data roaming charges across Europe completely by 2016.

Under current plans, companies will be banned from charging extra for incoming calls to people who are abroad from July 2014.

That is the first stage in a move to abandon all other roaming charges by 2016.

If
 the new rules come into force, mobile providers will either have to 
charge customers the same prices for phone calls across the EU, or allow
 them to switch providers for the period they are abroad, without 
changing their sim card.

Currently, the mobile network Three 
have taken the biggest step toward scrapping data roaming after they 
announced a tariff which allows users to browse the internet in 
Australia, Austria, Denmark, Hong Kong, Italy, Ireland and Sweden for 
the same price as on their UK plan.

Other
 networks offer bundles, which allow a set amount of data usage for a 
small fee which is then added to the customer's monthly bill.

Orange, O2 and T-Mobile all offer packages allowing between 15 and 30 megabytes of data for around two to three pounds per day.

Rather
 than charge for a specific amount of usage, Vodafone's EuroTraveller 
tariff charges a customer £3 per day to use the internet at their UK 
price plan whilst abroad in Europe.

Networks
 are fighting the Euro legislation, insisting that a ban on data roaming
 charges will cost the industry £6billion per year.

Top tips: Avoid running up huge phone bills abroad

Currently, holiday makers are advised to take precautions to avoid bumper bills, such as turning off data roaming and using free wi-fi. Smartphones will automatically start to update data when they connect to another network on holiday but step-by-step instructions for how to turn off roaming on a range of popular handsets can be found at ofcom.org.uk.

Users can connect to the internet at local wi-fi hotspots – often for free – while data roaming on their phone is still switched off or try the ‘old-school’ trick of visiting an internet cafe.

Experts recommend buying a booster, which works like an add-on for an existing price plan or package. It boosts the amount of calls, texts and data you can use when not in the UK.

Mobile networks offer a range of add-on packages for travellers who want to continue using the internet on holiday.

They all have bundles for within Europe, starting at £1 a day for 20 megabytes (20MB) of internet use with Orange, enough for an hour of Facebook, according to Confused.com.  But those heading further afield could find they have less choice.

Vodafone’s Data Traveller costs £5 a day for a 25MB daily allowance so holiday makers only pay on the days they use the internet. Orange’s Rest of World add-ons start at £6 a day for 30MB each day but it costs  £8 per MB if users go over their allowance.

T-Mobile charges £10 per 10MB outside the EU,  although this rises to £75 for the same deal, depending on the country visited.

Some people recommend buying a local SIM card to use when on holiday. However, this will only work for ‘unlocked’ phones and will give holidaymakers a new contact number.  Companies such as 0044 or Lebara allow consumers to buy foreign SIM cards before they go away.

To avoid shock bills, experts recommend trying to download films, maps or music before departure.

When it comes to calls, the European Commission has vowed landline calls anywhere in Europe will cost the same as ringing friends at home, while mobile calls will be capped at 16p a minute, but there are no plans to prevent high charges for holiday makers venturing further afield.

The proposals outlined by the European Commission would 'abolish premiums' within the 28 member states, meaning dialling relatives abroad would cost the same as a long-distance, domestic call.

However, Three has become the first UK mobile operator to allow holidaymakers to text and call the UK, as well as go online as part of their current mobile phone contracts.

The company launched its ‘Feel at Home scheme,’ which lets Three customers use their phones in the republic of Ireland, Australia, Italy, Austria, Hong Kong, Sweden and Denmark without being billed for extra international roaming charges.

It is hoped the move will spark a war among mobile phone network providers to let people use their phones abroad without worrying about the consequences.
