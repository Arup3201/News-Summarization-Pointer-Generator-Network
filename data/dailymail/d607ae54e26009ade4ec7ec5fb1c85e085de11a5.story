A woman says the drunk driver responsible for her father's death has magnified the trauma of her family's loss by confessing to the crime online in a widely publicized YouTube video.

'Every time that anything comes up, this whole thing has made the death of my father fresh,' Angela Canzani told WCMH-TV in Columbus. 'I feel like he died all over again. And all I keep hearing about is the message, and what people seem to forget is that a person is dead.'

Matthew Cordle, 22, admitted to killing Vicent Canzani in a 3 1/2-minute video posted to Youtube last week, which has since been viewed 2 million times.

Angela Canzani says the drunk driver responsible for her father's death has magnified the trauma of her family's loss by confessing to the crime online in a widely publicized YouTube video

In court: Matthew Cordle, pictured in court on Tuesday, has entered a surprising not guilty plea in his case. Just last week he confessed to a killing in a YouTube video - but a judge said the plea is a courtroom tactic

Defense strategy: Cordle's attorney, Martin Midian (right), said his client would likely plead not guilty at his arraignment, but he still intends to plead guilty at a later date

'My name is Matthew Cordle, and on 
June 22, 2013, I hit and killed Vincent Canzani,' he says. 'This video 
will act as my confession.'

Cordle has been praised for coming forward and using YouTube to send a message to others who might consider driving drunk.

Dramatic: Franklin County 
Judge Julie Lynch said she thinks his lawyers are hoping for a new judge

Cordle
will plead guilty to aggravated vehicular homicide on Sept. 18, 
according to his attorneys. He entered a preliminary plea of not guilty 
Wednesday in a procedural move that would allow a judge to be appointed 
that would accept a guilty plea.

Cordle is also charged with a misdemeanor count of operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol. If convicted, he faces up to 8 1/2 years in prison.

Angela Canzani has previously spoken out against Cordle, saying the only reason he posted the video is so he could try to get a lighter prison sentence.

She said he was ‘totally misleading’ with his confession
because he was already a suspect in the crime.

‘There was a traffic cam. There was a 
third car involved,’ Canzani told NBC News. ‘So people are kind of 
looking at this like he’s just coming out of nowhere…Like he’s some hero
or something.’

But on Friday, the
ex-wife of Mr Canzani told MailOnline she 'applauded' the decision of 
Cordle - who now faces criminal charges brought by the county prosecutor.

In the YouTube video, Cordle pleads with viewers not to drink and
drive.

'I can't bring Mr. Canzani back, and I can't erase what I've
done, but you can still be saved. Your victims can still be saved,' he says.

Video confession: The 3.5 minute video starts out with his face blurred and voice altered as he explains how he was driving drunk when he killed someone

Moment of truth: Matthew Cordle identifies himself when the effects are taken away and says that he will plead guilty to any charges that he faces stemming from the June 22 accident

His pledge: Cordle, 22, said that he was fully aware of the legal implications of making the video

Victim: Vincent Canzani was 61 at the time of his death (pictured recently at right) and previously served in the Navy (seen in his uniform in an undated photo at left)

Cordle
says in the video he 'made a mistake' when he decided to drive his 
truck home after 'drinking heavily' and hit the other car, killing Mr 
Canzani, of suburban Columbus.

An obituary for Mr Canzani says that he served as a missile technician for a submarine from 1980 to 1986.

Since leaving the Navy, he flourished 
as 'a gifted photographer' and was survived by two daughters and three 
great grandchildren.

The video was released in conjunction with a not-for-profit start up called Because I Said I Would, which is focused around having individuals make commitments to themselves and their goals using index cards.

A fan: Cleveland kidnap victim Gina DeJesus posed for a picture with the group's shirt after the founder met with her mother

Its website says that it aims to become a 'a social movement dedicated to bettering humanity through the power of a promise'.

The organization was founded by Alex Sheen who was inspired by his father, who died of lung cancer last September. At his father's funeral, they handed out promise cards in tribute to how his father always kept his promises.

In a message that was posted on the group's website when the confession video was published, Mr Sheen says that Mr Cordle was the one to reach out to him via Facebook message about the hit-and-run.

'After getting to know Matt, I can say with confidence that he truly regrets his decision that night. He describes the guilt he has as “insurmountable,”' Mr Sheen wrote in the post.

'Against all legal advice, Matthew decided to make this video and release it prior to any charges being filed against him. His goal is to raise awareness about the terrible consequences that drunk driving can have on innocent people.'

Cordle's confession is not the only high-profile action the group has been involved with. 

After the three young women were 
discovered in Ariel Castro's Cleveland home, Mr Sheen was moved to 
launch a ten-day walking campaign across the state in their honor.

Movement: The group's founder, Alex Sheen (seen closest to the camera) was inspired to go on a 10-day state-wide walk to raise awareness for sexual abuse victims after DeJesus, Amanda Berry and Michelle Knight were found

Big finish: He ended the walk by being greeted by Gina DeJesus' mother at the site of the 'House of Horrors', which is just six miles away from where Sheen lives

He said that he lives six miles away from the now-razed 'House of Horrors' and was moved by the girls' perseverance.

He used the walk as a way to raise awareness about sexual assault, and at the end, he was greeted by Gina DeJesus' mother.

Mr Sheen gave her a number of t-shirts with the organization's name printed on them, and in return, she later sent him a picture of Gina wearing the shirt.
