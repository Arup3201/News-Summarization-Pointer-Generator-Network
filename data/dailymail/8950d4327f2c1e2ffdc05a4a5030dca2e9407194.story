Boasting the latest in design and tech, the Ear Force headphones from Turtle Beach claim to offer the definitive audio experience for gaming.

Indeed, if judged on looks alone, it’s clear the X-Rays mean business. Sporting chunky lines with aggressive black styling and an attractive LED power switch, and they resemble something kitted out to the SAS.

Cutting edge: The Ear Force X-Ray headset is packed full of the latest technology

Look a little closer, though, and you’ll notice the quality of the materials – for example, the leatherette headband and memory foam ear cushions.

They’ve been marketed as the official headphones to Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, a game that perhaps better than any, shows off the X-Ray's impressive features.

Immediately noticeable is the Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. With crisp pitches and thundering bass, it brings audio to life with remarkable aplomb.

You’ll hear the tiniest details, and shudder at every crack and whoosh of explosions.

The depth of sound is wonderful, too – with the 360 degree audio allowing you to pinpoint the direction of every sound. Surround sound angles can be adjusted to optimise the audio experience.

If things get too loud, the Blast Limiter function lets you reduce the amplitude of explosions and gunfire, while optimal sound quality is achieved through a digital audio connector.

The X-Rays also use 2.4/5 GHZ Dual-Band wifi, which virtually eliminates interference, while duel Bluetooth pairing allows you to chat wirelessly.

Retailing for around £179 means that they are by no means cheap. But given the quality of the materials and state-of-the-art tech, the X-Rays make a brilliant alternative to a vastly more expensive home cinema.

Cheaper option: The KILOs may be around half the price, but they still provide excellent audio

There are also the cheaper KILO versions, which retail for £69.99. Although they are not as tech heavy as the X-Rays, the KILOs haven't skimped on quality.

The Bass Boost function, coupled with their massive 50mm speaker drivers, ensures immersive sound whatever the amplitude - making them a perfect purchase for the more causal gamer.
