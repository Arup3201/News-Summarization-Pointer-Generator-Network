Air travel can be infuriating at the best of times, but spare a thought for this unfortunate woman who just wanted to get away to start a new life.

Teri Weissinger, 55, ended up spending eight days stuck at a California airport because she didn’t have enough money to pay the baggage fees.

She didn’t know about her airline's extra baggage fees of $60, only had $30 to her name and could not raise the funds in time for her flight.

Infuriating: Being trapped in San Francisco International Airport for over a week was nothing short of a nightmare for Terri Weissinger

She then had to pay $150 to transfer 
to another flight and was eventually given the $210 by a church after 
eight nights of sleeping in the airport.

The nightmare story began as a broke 
Ms Weissinger, who hadn’t flown in five years, was trying to leave San 
Francisco to begin a new life in Idaho.

Ms Weissinger told MailOnline she been
self-employed for 25 years and decided to move more than 600 miles to 
Idaho to work for ConAgra Foods.

She booked her flight just before a 
law went into effect requiring ticket brokers to disclose all hidden 
fees and didn't know about baggage fees.

Packed her bags: She spent eight days sleeping in San Francisco International Airport while she tried to get the cash together to fly

US Airways refused her boarding 
permission despite her offer to pay the $60 fee when she landed - or 
even leave one of her bags behind.

Terri Weissinger flew in April, before a new federal law went into effect that requires ticket brokers to make all hidden fees clear.

She had booked her flight ticket on travel website Orbitz but did not know she would be charged $25 for one bag and $35 for a second bag.

Price comparison sites are making airlines offer lower up-front prices to get to the top of searches, so many rely on extra fees later on.

The largest airlines in the U.S. received $1.5billion in add-on fees from luggage and reservation changes in April, May and June, reported the Los Angeles Times.

But the airline said their policy 
didn't allow them to let her board without paying and airport security 
meant she couldn't leave her luggage.

‘She was embarrassed to beg for money,’ travel lawyer Al Anolik told MailOnline. ‘When it got out of hand she called the church.

'Last time she flew there were no charges,' he added to ABC7. 'I fly every few weeks - and I don't know what the new charges are.'

While attempting to resolve her 
situation by calling friends and family, she missed her plane and was 
then told she had to pay a $150 transfer fee.

'I started making phone calls to 
everybody I knew,' she told ABC7. 'I thought: "It looks like I might 
have to stay there tonight".'

It left her stuck, with no option but 
to live in the terminal. She slept in a stairwell and was treated for 
anxiety at the airport medical clinic.

When she tried to plead with airport 
authorities for help, Ms Weissinger claimed she was threatened with 
arrest on vagrancy charges.

‘It’s ridiculous,’ she told ABC 7. 'I 
couldn't believe it sometimes, you know, it's just incredibly ridiculous
situation to be in.'

'It was exhausting. I didn’t have much
money and I was buying packets of trail mix. It was like going on a 
camping trip without any camping equipment'

Finally she decided to call the nearby
Airport Church of Christ, which was moved by her situation and quickly 
raised the $210 she needed.

Robert Urbinam, of the Airport Church of Christ, said their small congregation of 65 were happy to help out.

‘We go by what the Bible teaches and 
the Bible teaches to do good to all men,’ he told Patch. ‘When someone 
comes to us for help, we help them.’

On her way: She was relieved when she was finally allowed to board her plane to Idaho but said she was in an 'incredibly ridiculous situation'

She had previously been told by the 
airline because she could not pay the $150 change fee she would have to 
shell out $1,000 on a new flight.

couldn't believe it sometimes, you know, it's just incredibly ridiculous
situation to be in'

But the church only had to pay $60 for
her in the end and she actually  got put on a United 
Airlines flight in a bizarre turn of events - after the change fee was dropped, she said.

‘I was relieved because I hadn’t had a
shower in eight days,' she told MailOnline. 'I didn’t we have any money. I kept thinking I was
going to leave the next day.

‘It was exhausting. I didn’t have much
money and I was buying packets of trail mix. It was like going on a 
camping trip without any camping equipment.’

Film reference: She has compared her ordeal to The Terminal, a 2004 film starring Tom Hanks, where an eastern immigrant finds himself stranded at JFK airport

'We have apologised to Ms Weissinger 
for her experience, but unfortunately are unable to offer a refund,’ a 
US Airways spokesman said.

'When you purchase a non-refundable 
ticket, you accept the terms and conditions'

'When you purchase a non-refundable 
ticket, you accept the terms and conditions. If a passenger cannot 
travel with their bags, they need to make other arrangements.'

She has even compared her ordeal to 
The Terminal, a 2004 film starring Tom Hanks, where an immigrant finds 
himself stranded at JFK airport.

An Orbitz spokesman told ABC 7: 'For 
several years, Orbitz has provided details on baggage fees on our site 
as a resource to our customers.'

Ms Weissinger told MailOnline she was 'really pleased and delighted' with the exposure her story has been given by news outlets around the world.
