From Tokyo’s take on the Hackney Carriage to a shape-shifting electric tricycle, Japan is playing host to some of the world’s wackiest cars.

The vehicles of 14 Japanese and 18 overseas manufacturers are being exhibited at the Tokyo motor show which opened today.

Small has proven big with a number of carmakers showcasing tiny electric vehicles in which the passengers sit in tandem.

A highlight at the show is an outlandish shape-shifting tricycle by Kawasaki Motors named ‘J’.

J can morph between a low-slung riding position to a higher seating mode for more relaxed cruising.

Small is also the theme for the design of a miniature fuel-cell powered van called ‘FC Deck’ by Daihatsu.

The van, that looks more like a toy truck than a road vehicle, is 3.3m long, 1.5m wide and 1.9m tall.

A stunning model of the 'DeZir' has also been unveiled by Renault.

The DeZir is an all-electric two seater coupé with butterfly doors, a top speed of 112 mph and an interior of red leather.

Meanwhile the world’s biggest car maker, Toyota, unveiled its JPN TAXI concept which has taken more than a little bit of inspiration from London’s black cabs.

The car is fitted with liquefied petroleum gas hybrid system and features a large interior monitor showing passenger information, including the route to the destination and the fare.

The group also unveiled its FV2 tilting concept car which uses voice and image recognition to determine the driver's mood

Closer to reality, Toyota has found itself in a race with Honda to bring the first mass-produced hydrogen-powered car to market.

The group is promising a mass-produced fuel cell car called FCV by 2015 in the latest ambitious push to go green by an industry long skeptical about the super-clean technology that runs on hydrogen.

Satoshi Ogiso, the Toyota executive in charge of fuel cells, said the vehicle is not just for leasing to officials and celebrities but will be an everyday car for ordinary consumers.

The FCV looks ready to hit the streets, not all that different in exterior design from the Prius gas-electric hybrid, and in contrast to the other fun but outlandishly bizarre models at the show.

Toyota's model will have plenty of competition.

Korean rival Hyundai said earlier this week it will start selling a Tucson SUV powered by a fuel cell next year, which if realised will be the first mass-market arrival of the technology.

Honda is scheduled to take the wraps off a next-generation version at the Los Angeles Auto Show later this week.

The Japanese government, as well as the U.S. and parts of Europe, are getting serious in investing in hydrogen fueling-station infrastructure, which is a must before fuel cells can become practical.

Skeptics say hydrogen-fueling stations are even more expensive to build than recharging stations for electric cars, partly because electricity is almost everywhere and new and safe ways for producing, storing and transferring hydrogen as fuel will be needed.
