Mystery: What remains has been billed as Britain's creepiest whodunit to date

It has been billed as Britain’s creepiest and most claustrophobic ‘whodunit’ to date.

And tonight fans of the hit BBC One crime drama What Remains will finally find out who murdered Melissa Young and left her body to rot in a loft for almost two years.

The show, which has a six million audience, has been dubbed a cross between ITV’s Broadchurch and the Danish crime drama The Killing. 

The action takes place in an old house divided into flats.

Over the past three weeks cameras have explored every nook and cranny of the building to make viewers feel they are trapped there with the killer.

Tony Basgallop, who wrote the show, said: ‘It’s Cluedo, isn’t it? An old-school whodunit.’

Here’s our guide to those in the frame, but don’t make up your minds yet – as the twists and turns keep coming even after the crime is solved.....

Kieron Moss: Killer odds 2-1

Newspaper reporter, divorcé, recovering alcoholic. Lives in  Flat 2 with girlfriend, fellow journalist Patricia Keenan.

Seems uninterested in a potential scoop on his doorstep, insisting there is nothing suspicious about the death.

Tells police he had little contact with the victim – but is later unmasked as a former lover.

Has a history of sexual violence when he falls off the wagon and treated Melissa with contempt while they were seeing each other.

Basgallop says: ‘Kieron has  these demons – this monster that’s his alcoholism.’

Suspects: Alcoholic Kieron Moss (left) is the bookies favourite. But Elaine Markham (right) bullied Melissa

Elaine Markham: Killer odds 3-1

Short-tempered and controlling graphic designer. Shares Flat 3 with lover and business partner Peggy Scott.

Bullied Melissa into taking part in an underwear shoot for a prospective client and became aggressive when Melissa said she didn’t want the photographs to appear in print.

Elaine is equally intimidating towards timid Peggy.

Basgallop says: ‘Both Elaine and Peggy used Melissa and she let them down. Melissa was in the middle of these two which was not a very nice place to be.’

Joe Sellers: Killer odds 3-1

Busybody bachelor who lives in basement flat. Doesn’t get on with neighbours.

A teacher, he told police he lived alone but, in fact, has been living with a former pupil, Liz Fletcher, for five years.

Makes no secret of his dislike for Melissa, saying: ‘I didn’t like the girl and don’t see why I should pretend I did just because she has gone.’

However, he knew Melissa’s  mother and cared for her in the weeks leading up to her own death.

Basgallop says: ‘Joe is the guy everyone is slightly scared of. There is a feeling that he is a monster because he lives alone.’

Creepy: Teacher Joe Moss (left) makes no secret of his dislike of Melissa.  Little is known about Richard Webb (right), who may appear friendly, but could have plenty of skeletons in his closet

Richard Webb: Killer odds 4-1

Seemingly affable former resident of  Flat 4 who warns Detective Harper the residents are ‘not a friendly bunch’.

Could have skeletons in the cupboard as he is the character  we know least about.

We do know that Melissa once rejected his advances, so was he out for revenge?

No longer lives in the UK, leading to speculation that he may have fled the scene of the crime.

However, seems genuinely shocked when Harper contacts him about the death.

In stark contrast to  some of the other residents, he is  only too keen to speak about  some of Melissa’s good qualities.

Revenge: Michael Jenson (left) has a vendetta against his former teacher, Joe Sellers. But Adam Moss (right) constantly bullied Melissa

Michael Jenson: Killer odds 5-1

Shoe salesman and father-to-be. Has just moved into the block with girlfriend Vidya Khan.

Would appear to be in the clear because he never lived at the flats when Melissa lived there, but is known to Joe Sellers, who taught him at school, and Liz Fletcher.

Claims Sellers victimised him at school and makes it clear he is out for revenge. Breaks into Sellers’s school locker and strikes up a relationship with Liz.

Jenson tells his girlfriend: ‘The old b*****d had it in for me and still does. He was horrible to me. I hated him back then and still hate him.

'He’ll find out soon enough that he’s not dealing with a kid any longer.’

Adam Moss: Killer odds 6-1

Kieron Moss’s highly sexed and deeply troubled teenage son, who treats his father’s flat as a hotel.

He is a bully who never missed a chance to humiliate Melissa when she was alive.

Taunted her about her weight and has described her as ‘a skank’, ‘heifer’ and ‘wildebeest’.

After Melissa’s death, the word ‘skank’ later appears daubed on a wall in her flat.

Adam has made a series of passes at his father’s girlfriend. She is scared of being left alone with him but even Kieron, who has very little time for him, doesn’t think he would hurt a fly.

Violent streak: Recluse Liz Fletcher (left) knocked out retired detective Len Harper during one of her midnight walks. But does Peggy Scott's (right) reluctance to return to the house implicate her?

Liz Fletcher: Killer odds 10-1

Woman with a troubled past who is on the run from someone or something.

Former pupil of Joe Sellers who turned to him for help and moved into his flat five years ago.

Living there secretly, she rarely leaves. As a result, none of the neighbours knows of her existence.

Has a habit of wandering round the building at night and makes several visits to Melissa’s flat. 

Has a violent streak and knocks an unsuspecting Detective Len Harper unconscious when he interrupts one of her night-time prowls.

Fascinated by some of Melissa’s most private possessions.

Peggy Scott: Killer odds 12-1

Mild-mannered photographer who is desperate to escape an abusive relationship with Elaine.

Lies to the police about the photographic shoot with Melissa and insists that she was quite happy for the pictures to be taken.

Tells Elaine that she can’t return to the home they share after the body has been discovered.

She says: ‘I can’t go back there. Can’t spend another night in that flat. It’s not the flat. It’s you.’

Is sympathetic to Melissa and returns photographs to her when she expresses discomfort about the shoot.

Victim: Overweight, single, but with a good heart, Melissa Young's body was found decompossing

Melissa Young is an overweight singleton who lived in an upstairs flat.

Her decomposed body is discovered in the loft by a couple who have moved into a flat below hers.

Through use of flashbacks, we learn more about Melissa’s troubled relationship with her neighbours, her battles to lose weight and fraught love life.

She is kind and considerate, but her good intentions are exploited by fellow residents in the building.

Len Harper, a widower and detective, is about to 
retire when Melissa’s body is found.

He becomes obsessed with the case and 
refuses to accept claims by colleagues that her death was suicide.

Continues to investigate even though he is no longer on the force. 
Residents don’t know he is retired and treat him as if he is a full-time
detective. 

Michael Jensen’s pregnant girlfriend, Vidya Khan, is off work and finds the body with him.

She does all she can to help 
Harper solve the case. Tracks down an old friend of Melissa and 
uncovers vital  evidence about her private life.

Hack: Patricia Keenan sees the death as a news story and helps Harper

Patricia Keenan sees the death of a young woman as a 
news story and is keen to write a piece about it.

Patricia helps
Harper with his inquiries and uncovers the evidence, which unmasks 
Keiron as Melissa’s former lover.

Len Harper’s former colleagues in the 
police do not think there is anything suspicious about the death and, in
common with some of Melissa’s neighbours, think she may have committed 
suicide or suffered an accident. Harper remains convinced of foul play.

Producers wanted a forbidding property to be a character in its own right with its own secrets, just like each of the residents.

A house in Greenwich, South London, was used for exterior shots but interiors were built at Ealing and Wimbledon studios.

One master flat was built, with the illusion of five self-contained apartments created by use of movable walls, doors and fireplaces and plug-in windows, kitchens and bathrooms.
