A young man who was convicted of shooting his mother to death as a teen and sent to a mental hospital for years was still able to buy 15 guns once he was released.

Chris Oberender was convicted of killing his mother in 1995 when he was 14-years-old, and he was sentenced to a mental hospital until he was 21-years-old.

Now he is awaiting jail in Minnesota for buying illegal firearms since he is banned from owning guns because he is a convicted felon.

Jailed: Chris Oberender is in jail awaiting sentencing for his illegal firearms charges after he purchased 15 guns even though he is a convicted felon

His criminal history is the only reason why his purchases were illegal, since he complied with other Minnesota laws by applying for a gun permit in 2011 and was approved because the court records were incomplete.

The case comes as President Obama is pushing for universal background checks on all gun purchases and a ban on assault rifles in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.

Oberender was caught and now faces jail time is because Watertown Township Sheriff Jim Olson recognized his name in daily police reports.

Oberender caught the attention of the now-greying sheriff because the murder case was one of his first as a young detective.

He told CBS that he was immediately concerned and checked Facebook to make sure it was the same person, only to find that the now-32-year-old Oberender had proudly posted pictures of his firearms on his profile.

'He can't have guns. Chris Oberender should not have guns,' Mr Olson told CBS.

In what Mr Olson calls a 'chilling' twist, police found a letter that he wrote to his dead mother while they were searching his home, which read: 'I am so homicide. What is wrong with me. I think about killing all the time.'

Oberender remains in jail waiting on his illegal firearms possession charges, but this is one of cases authorities fear most.

The courts failed to keep complete records for Oberender, meaning that his finger prints and legal record were not present when he applied for a background check in 2011.

Like 168,000 other people in the state, incomplete records mean that permits must be issued if requested and they cannot be held back on account of the court's mishaps.

Lucida Jesson, the commissioner of the Department of Human Services, said that her office has to be specifically asked to do a full run of an applicant's file during the permit process, and a check is not always automatic.

In this case, her office was never asked to check his health record, for if they were, police would have been alerted to his forced stay in the mental hospital.

'In this case, we were lucky. No one was hurt through the good actions of local law enforcement,' Ms Jesson said.
