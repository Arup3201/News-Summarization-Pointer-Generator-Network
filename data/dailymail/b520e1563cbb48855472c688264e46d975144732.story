It's not everyday you stumble across a three-storey house  built entirely from a stack of shipping containers.

But in the Brisbane suburb of Graceville, 8km south west of the city, that's exactly what you'll find. The three-storey home designed by Australian builder Todd Miller comprises of 31 strategically placed containers filled with all the essential items of any home, plus a whole host of extras.

Miller, of ZieglerBuild, describes the  three-storey structure as the 'first of its kind' in Australia and has been built out of brand new, not recycled, containers.

It contains four bedrooms positioned over three levels, with the top floor completely dedicated to the master bedroom. It is Built over 706 square metres and is possibly the most innovative of its kind in the country - with only one other residential property like it in Australia.

Standing among a row of quiet, contemporary  properties at  Jaora St, Graceville, it features a mezzanine reading room, a pull out queen wall bed in the rumpus room, an art study, workshop, gym space, water tank and saltwater pool.

The only other house which rivals it has been built from five containers, and is located on just a quarter the size of the land. The home is built to flood regulations and will be auctioned on site on December 1.

Mr Miller said it was the 'hardest house he has ever built.' 'The reason it was so hard is that every single thing I did I had to think of.'

'Normally you can just go and grab a pair of stairs from a steel company and whack it on the front of the house and you're done.' 

'But everything I did it was actually very taxing.' 

He said whether you 'love it or hate it, as long as people think it's quite clever, then I've ticked the design brief.'

The home is flood-proof and will be auctioned on site on December 1

The house is permamently secured in position with the middle and top layer completely insulated to adapt to the extreme Queensland conditions

Mr Miller said because of the 'vortex' of the design and the way he has designed the glass the home doesn't require air conditioning

The containers have eight layers of paint when they come out of the factory, however Mr Miller has added another five layers of paint which reflects the suns rays

Mr Miller hopes 'someone falls in love with the house' when it goes to auction in December
