It is a familiar story of an overseas player coming to the Premier League and struggling with idiosyncrasies of English life when they arrive: the weather, the food, the intensity of the football.

The only difference is that Eric Dier is English. Being a 20-year-old £4million recruit from Portugal and making an immediate impact on the Premier League isn’t so remarkable these days. Being an Englishman so immersed in Portuguese life, where he grew up and played for Sporting Lisbon, that his mum feared he was losing his native language is more noteworthy.

‘When I moved to the Sporting Lisbon academy and went to a Portuguese school my mum said she was worried because my Portuguese was getting better than my English,’ said Dier, whose family moved to Portugal when he was seven because his mother’s role as director of a catering company meant she had to be there to prepare for Euro 2004. ‘My whole life was in Portuguese. I only spoke to my family in English.’

Homecoming king: Eric Dier has returned to England after spending most of his life in Portugal

Now he is back for good, a summer signing for Tottenham and, bizarrely for a defender, he has two goals in two games. Perhaps more importantly, Tottenham have two clean sheets in the Premier League and he has settled in very well under Mauricio Pochettino.

But however Anglo Saxon he might look and however well connected he might be in England — his grandfather, Ted Croker, was the former secretary of the Football Association — it is bewildering to be back. Although his parents now live in London, almost all his life has been spent in another country and he is still searching for his bearings.

‘It’s really strange,’ he said. ‘Last time I was living here I was seven and I don’t really remember it. It wasn’t strange being here for a week, but then when I stayed here after that, two weeks, three weeks, then it became strange. But I’m getting used to it.’

Naturally he misses the country that was his home. ‘All my friends are Portuguese and live in Portugal. You have restaurants, places you go. The food...’ he said wistfully. The biggest difference? ‘The weather!’ he said instantly, though he claims he doesn’t mind the rain.

Ironically, when he was first picked up by Sporting scouts from his ex-pat existence — his school was initially an international one and his life on the Algarve was conducted in English — he experienced the culture shock in reverse.

‘From eight years old to 13, I didn’t live in at the academy but I was training at Sporting and in the beginning I was seen as an outsider,’ he said. ‘I didn’t speak the language very well which made it really hard. But once I had learnt the language and they realised I wasn’t going anywhere, I didn’t have any problems. By the time I was 13 I was settled and I was just like one of them.’

It was a privileged start in life as Sporting’s academy is a prestigious alma mater, having produced Luis Figo, Cristiano Ronaldo and Nani. ‘They like to remind you,’ he said. ‘There are pictures everywhere, big, big photographs.’ 

Giving something back: Eric Dier met students at the Frederick Knight Sports Centre to help young people

Eric Dier made a special visit to Frederick Knight Sports Centre in North London to meet students studying in Tottenham Hotspur Foundation’s Education and Football Development programme, taking part in a Q&A session.

It also afforded him opportunities most of his contemporaries have not had. Instead of playing in the Premier League’s Under-21 League at training grounds in front of scouts and parents for the past two years, he has featured in Sporting’s first team taking on the likes of Benfica in front of 64,000 in the Lisbon derby.

‘I don’t think anything anywhere matches playing Benfica,’ he said. ‘It’s just different to anything anywhere else. They’re night games, they hate each other, there are flares and banners: everything goes off; the whole country stops. It’s massive. Apart from the big teams, there aren’t many competitive games in Portugal, so when that game comes it’s a big occasion.’

Equally, he has been schooled in an entirely different way from many young English players, only being allowed to play small-sided games until he was 12, a move now replicated at most English clubs.

‘We played seven-a-side when I was much younger and you played a 2-3-1 with a goalkeeper. The two defenders — I was one of them — didn’t work as centre-backs, they worked as full-backs. You would go wide and one would attack at a time and be a big part of attacking.’

That presumably accounts for his adaptability at centre-half or right-back and his ability to bring the ball out with more poise than most English defenders. He sees himself as a ball-playing defender — ‘I don’t want to burst my own bubble but I’d like to think so’ — and cites the likes of Gerard Pique and Rio Ferdinand as influences. ‘I think any kid would choose to look at one of them, more than a traditional centre-back. It’s more likeable, isn’t it?’

He experienced traditional English coaching when he had a short spell at Everton on loan at 17 and it seems the main difference was the shouting. ‘It was tough,’ he said. ‘In Portugal you are not used to coaches screaming at you. They just sit there and watch. So it toughened me up.’ He laughs at the thought. ‘I was probably still seen as soft to them but it toughened me up!

‘That was hard for me, going to Liverpool because I was there by myself. I was 16, 17. I had left Portugal, which was my home and left my friends and family. So it was a massive culture shock. But it helped me a lot. I always say I went there a boy and went back a man.’

And although he returned to Sporting after Everton, his intention was always to return to his home country if he could. ‘It’s a massive step up. I’m not going to get carried away saying it’s the same, because it’s not,’ he said. ‘It’s a completely different world. I was texting Marcos Rojo at Man United the other day, because we were at Sporting together and he said the same things. It’s a different world in every way. Every game is competitive, in every game the stadium is full, home and away. There are loads of great players: Tottenham have great players, Liverpool, Man United, it’s full of superstars.’

Familiar faces: Eri Dier will come up against Lazar Markovic (L) again when Spurs face Liverpool

He will be facing a few of those stars on Sunday. One he knows well in Lazar Markovic — ‘a really, really good player’ — having played against him when the Serb was at Benfica; another, Mario Balotelli, is less familiar though he is equally unfazed.

‘It doesn’t really bother me to be honest,’ said Dier. ‘They’re great players but I just try to respect any player and try to do my best. I’m not really bothered who it is.’

And given such confidence, you would imagine he will soon feel right at home here.
