Jose Aldo battled to an absorbing victory in his rematch with Chad Mendes before delivering a stinging rebuke at the watching Conor McGregor.

The Brazilian won by unanimous decision at UFC 179 in Rio to retain his featherweight title and extend his winning streak to 15, one short of Anderson Silva’s record.

Aldo immediately turned his fire to McGregor who has repeatedly called out the long-reigning champion.

‘I’ll fight anyone,’ he said. ‘I am the king, Mendes is a prince and here we have a joker (McGregor).’

The Dubliner received a heated ‘welcome’ at a Q&A session on Friday as he chases a title shot at a football stadium in his home city.

He must first overcome Dennis Siver in Boston on Janaury 18.

‘In my mind the belt is already wrapped around my waist,’ he said. ‘I already walk around like the champion.’

Aldo took some heavy blows from American Mendes but prevailed 49-46 on all three of the judges scorecards

Aldo, meanwhile, had won his first fight with Mendes in the first round two years ago with a knee to the face but he was taken the five-round distance on this occasion before prevailing 49-46 on all three scorecards.

‘I deserved to win,’ added Aldo. ‘He hit me a few times but I hit him a lot more. It was a great a fight and I’m sure everyone enjoyed it.’

Aldo is now unbeaten since 2005 after his seventh successful title defence while defeat would have left Brazil without a UFC champion for the first time in eight years.

Mendes (right) was beaten by Aldo in the first round two years ago but took this fight the full five rounds

Mendes had won five fights since his first defeat to Aldo and was aggressive from the start, landing with kicks and punches to open a wound on Aldo’s nose.

But the Brazilian recovered quickly and finished the first round strongly, twice knocking Mendes down with powerful strikes.

‘He rang my bell for sure,’ said Mendes. ‘I was just going so hard I didn’t know what was going on. I was just trying to push myself and obviously just out-strike him and mix things up well.’

Aldo overcame a low blow in the second session to out-jab Mendes but the challenger found the target with several leg kicks before finishing the round strongly with a straight left.

And Mendes connected with an uppercut-hook combination in the third but Aldo recovered to edge the rest of the five-minute session, landing a series of blows.

The pace slowed in the penultimate round as Mendes attempted to seize the initiative with both men trading shots in the closing stages.

Although Aldo finished the fight with a swollen eye, he enjoyed the greater success in the fifth and final round, surviving a takedown and winning the punch exchanges.
