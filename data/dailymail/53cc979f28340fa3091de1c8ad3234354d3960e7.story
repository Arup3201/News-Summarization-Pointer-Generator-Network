Road rage: Kimberly Pankratius, 36, was at a Walmart on Saturday evening when she spotted Julie and Christopher Weakly pulling into a parking spot that she had been waiting for

An angry shopper drove her car into a  couple  after she spotted them 'stealing' a parking spot that she had been waiting for in Walmart.

Kimberly Pankratius, 36, flew into a rage  when she spotted Julie and Christopher Weakly pulling into the spot at a Walmart on Saturday evening.

She then pulled up alongside their vehicle and shouted out ‘douche bags.’

Julie Weakly, 40, told police that she and her husband ignored Pankratius’s comments ‘and continued walking towards the store.

But Pankratius sped toward them in her PT Cruiser, striking one of the victims, according to police. 

Christopher Weakly told police that as they approached Walmart, the couple heard tires squealing and saw Pankratius speeding towards them.

As the car turned in front of them his wife was struck in the arm by the driver’s side mirror. 

The impact caused the mirror to break and hang off the vehicle. Though she was in pain, Weakly declined medical treatment. 

Christopher Weakly told police that the PT Cruiser--which sped away from the lot--was ‘only inches’ away from hitting him.

They then quickly wrote down the  car’s license plate, according to The Smoking Gun.

Weakly said that he ‘inadvertently’ took the spot for which Pankratius was waiting.

Later, when police questioned Pankratius, she confessed to the parking lot rage incident. 

She said that she felt 'really bad' and added, ‘I did do it. I’m so, so scared.’

Pankratius claimed to be  angry that the couple had taken her parking spot and was ‘attempting to drive fast towards them to scare them.’

She has been charged with two felonies, assault and use of a deadly weapon to commit a felony.

She was booked into the Lancaster County jail, where she remains locked up in lieu of $2500 bond.
