A self-described conservative Republican who is a manager in the Internal Revenue Service office that targeted tea party groups told investigators that he, not the White House, set the review in motion, the top Democrat on the House watchdog committee said Sunday.

Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., released a partial transcript of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform interview with the unnamed manager in the IRS' Cincinnati office.

In it, the employee said the extra scrutiny for tea party groups' tax exempt status was an effort to be consistent in reviewing applications and not driven by politics.

Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings: Says 'extreme accusations' of Washington's involvement in the IRS scandal are 'unsubstantiated'

This letterhead from the IRS headquarters in Washington, DC, accompanied a probing letter directed at a tea party group. The IRS Inspector General investigated only similar communications from the agency's Cincinnati office

'He is a conservative Republican 
working for the IRS. I think this interview and these statements go a 
long way to what's showing that the White House was not involved in 
this,' Cummings said.

'Based upon everything I've seen, the
 case is solved. And if it were me, I would wrap this case up and move 
on, to be frank with you,' Cummings added.

In the five-hour interview conducted 
last week, the manager said one of his employees brought to him a tea 
party group's application for tax exempt status.

The manager said he 
recognized the political implications of the decision and flagged it for
 an office in Washington. Some Republicans have suggested that the 
Washington office initiated the close examination.

IRS offices in the California towns of El Monte and Laguna Niguel sent politically motivated letters to tea party groups, suggesting that the problem reached beyond the Cincinnati office where the IG report focused

One letter, sent to a northern California organization, demanded to know about its links with the Redding (Calif.) Tea Party Patriots. 'Tea party' was one phrase that reportedly triggered a 'Be On The Lookout' notice among IRS employees looking for politically conservative applicants for tax-exempt statuses

Republicans have complained the IRS 
targeted tea party groups because they are critical of Democrats and 
President Barack Obama. An internal IRS report found the agency 
improperly targeted the small-government advocates for additional 
scrutiny.

The uproar forced out the acting IRS 
chief and put the White House on the defensive against those who 
suggested Obama was using the government to go after political enemies.

Sunday's release of yet another partial transcript was unlikely to quiet those critics.

'The American public wants to know 
why targeting occurred and who was involved,' said oversight chairman 
Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., in statement released Sunday. 'The 
testimony excerpts Ranking Member Cummings revealed today did not 
provide anything enlightening or contradict other witness accounts. The 
only thing Ranking Member Cummings left clear in his comments today is 
that if it were up to him the investigation would be closed.'

The Tea Party Patriots and other conservative groups provided a powerful rallying force during the 2010 midterm elections. It was around the same time that the Obama administration's IRS began targeting such groups that applied for tax-exempt nonprofit status

Oversight committee investigators 
have now interviewed at least five IRS employees about targeting 
conservative groups for additional scrutiny when they applied for 
tax-exempt status during the 2010 and 2012 elections. Some employees 
said they believed that officials in Washington were directing their 
work but didn't show any direct evidence to support their statements.

Cummings and Issa have been releasing
 portions of interviews that back up their assertions. But neither has 
released full transcripts, making it difficult to discern a complete 
story. Also, the portions released tend to offer employees' views on 
what was happening, not definitive orders that directed them to 
scrutinize closely tea party applications.

Rain or shine: Tea party stalwarts were known for stubbornly supporting a strict reading of the U.S. Constitution, and for getting under the skin of political liberals. News that the IRS, under the Obama administration, singled them out for special screening, may energize them into another potent force in time for the 2014 election

Cummings declined to release the full transcript of the interview he posted on Democrats' oversight website.

A Cummings spokeswoman, Jennifer Hoffman, declined to release the employees' identity.

In the 15-page memo describing their 
interview with the manager, Democrats on the committee said they were 
withholding the employee's name at the request of the IRS.

Cummings appeared on CNN's 'State of the Union' and CBS's 'Face the Nation'.
