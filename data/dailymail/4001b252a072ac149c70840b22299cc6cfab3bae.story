Radamel Falcao's former Monaco team-mate Nabil Dirar believes the Colombian must be regretting his failed loan move to Manchester United even though he was not happy in France.

The former Atletico Madrid striker moved to Old Trafford on a season-long loan  last summer but has struggled to hit the heights he achieved before suffering a serious knee injury.

United will have to pay £46million to make Falcao's transfer permanent but having only scored four goals all season Louis van Gaal's side are unlikely to take up that option.

And Dirar has revealed that Falcao was not happy in France but thinks he would have been better off staying at Monaco.

'I think Falcao must be biting his fingers [ruing the fact] he's gone,' he told Le Parisien. 'Here, he would have played and participated in the Champions League. But he may need more atmosphere.

'In Monaco, he was not feeling well.'
