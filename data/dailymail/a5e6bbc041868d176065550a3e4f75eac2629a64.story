Supermarkets have sparked a forecourt price-war by slashing up to 4p a litre at the pumps.

Motoring groups welcomed the cuts - worth up to £2 per fill-up - but said that the supermarkets had been until now trailing rivals who'd already started undercutting them over the past fortnight ago.

The price-cut moves by Sainsbury, Asda and Tesco also came as campaigners urge the Chancellor ahead of next week's Budget to abandon a planned 3p a litre hike planned for September - or even announce a cut.

Price battle: Sainsbury's has cut the cost of fuel from today, with Asda and Tesco following suit

Sainsbury's sparked the price war by announcing that from today petrol prices at the company's 279 forecourts will dip by 4p a litre, with diesel being reduced by 3p a litre.

Asda then responded by announcing it would be cutting its petrol by up to 3p a litre and its diesel by up to 2p a litre, adding that drivers would pay no more than 134.7p a litre for petrol and 141.7p a litre for diesel.

And Tesco then jumped in with a 3p drop at its 496 forecourts.

Latest petrol price figures show the cost of filling up is continuing to put the squeeze on motorists, going up by another 5p a litre in February alone.

This increase added £2.50 to the cost of a typical 50-litre refill, or £3.50 to fill up a Ford Mondeo.

A family with two petrol cars is now spending £10.62 a month more on fuel than at the beginning of the year.

Average UK petrol prices stand at 
around 137,08p a litre, following a surge that started in the second 
week of January when the price was 132.01p.

Since the start of 2013, diesel pump prices have increased from around 140p a litre to 143.96p.

The AA welcomed the move. AA head of public affairs Paul Watters said:'This is a substantial fall, worth £2 a tank of petrol, and fairly reflects the drop in wholesale costs which started in late February.

'However, many non-supermarket fuel stations started undercutting supermarket prices a fortnight ago.'

He said: 'Drivers will very much welcome Sainsbury's move which gives respite after the third 8p-or-more pump price surge in the past 12 months.

'The response of other supermarkets, hopefully passing on the full drop in wholesale costs and not just where they feel they need to, will dictate the extent of this potential boost to family budgets.'

Whitewash? The Office of Fair Trading said sharp rises in fuel prices was caused by increases in tax and not price-fixing by oil companies

In January motoring groups accused the Office of 
Fair Trading of ‘a whitewash’ yesterday after the watchdog ruled out a 
full inquiry into petrol prices.

The OFT, which launched a probe last year, claimed there was no evidence drivers were being ripped off.

For years motorists have complained that pump prices soar when the price of crude oil rises, but fail to drop if it then falls.

George Osborne is coming under mounting pressure to order a fuel duty freeze in this month’s Budget, as experts warned prices were spiralling out of control.

Pressure: George Osborne is being advised to freeze duty on fuel as experts warn prices are going to soar

Tory MPs are urging the Chancellor to cancel a 3p-a-litre rise in fuel duty planned for September.

Motoring organisations warned that families could not take much more, following a 6p rise in fuel prices since the start of the year.

Conservative MP Robert Halfon has dubbed fuel duty a ‘toxic tax’ and said action to bring it under control was now more important than raising the income tax threshold, which has been the Coalition’s top tax priority.

‘This Government has 
done more than almost any other in recent times to reduce the cost of 
fuel but we need to go further... in the long term, when the financial 
conditions allow, to actually cut fuel duty,' he said.

‘When
fuel duty goes up it’s not just a tax on fuel because food prices go 
up, bus prices go up, it crushes businesses, it crushes families, it’s a
disincentive to work because people can’t afford to drive to work.’

Last week it emerged that the poorest car owners are being forced to shell out more than a quarter of their ready cash to keep a vehicle on the road.

Typically, a poor household will spend £44 a week on motoring expenses out of a total seven-day budget of £167, according to the RAC Foundation. Of this, a total of £16 is used to buy petrol or diesel and £8.30 goes on insurance.

This means the most hard-up 10 per cent of car-owning households are having to put at least 27 per cent of their disposable income towards owning and running a vehicle.

Rising costs: The average 5p a litre increase in February added £2.50 to the cost of a typical 50-litre refill

By contrast, motoring costs only represent about 12 per cent of the disposable income of the wealthiest car-owning households.

RAC Foundation director Stephen Glaister said: 'These figures should shock Chancellor George Osborne, with some households mired in transport poverty.

'We already knew transport was the single biggest area of household expenditure bar none. But this spending breakdown just for car-owning households is not normally available. It lays bare the truth about the extent of transport poverty in the UK.'
