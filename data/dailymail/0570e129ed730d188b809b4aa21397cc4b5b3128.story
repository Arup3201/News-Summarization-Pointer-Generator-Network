Pictures have surfaced showing Ashton Kutcher with a blonde woman who resembles his alleged lover Sara Leal three months before their reported nightclub ‘fling’.

The actor was seen leaving the Roosevelt Hotel with the woman back in June after watching the Beacher’s Madhouse show with friends.

In the unearthed photographs, the 33-year-old is seen driving off with her seated in the back seat of his car.

His wife, Demi Moore, 48, was not in attendance.

Kutcher addressed the rumours for the first time today, writing on Twitter: 'When you ASSUME to know that which you know nothing of you make an ASS out of U and ME.'

And yesterday Kutcher tweeted a link to his Spotify account on where he was playing the Public Enemy song Don't Believe the Hype.

Meanwhile a report emerged claiming Leal has demanded a $250,000 pay-off to buy her silence.

She is said to be hoping the Two and 
Half Men start will come up with the cash to stop her from revealing 
intimate details of their fling - and save his marriage to actress Demi 
Moore.

Twitter response: Kutcher posted this message on his page yesterday

Leal has met with lawyers who help negotiate a settlement for a rehab worker allegedly assaulted by Lindsay Lohan.

But sources told the New York Post Leal is looking for a six-figure pay-off or she will sell her story to the media.

'Sara is talking to multiple media 
outlets for a deal. She wants $250,000,but the offers haven't been as 
high,' a source told the Post.

Nightclub: Ashton allegedly met up with the blonde at Fluxx in San Diego on Friday evening

'What she really wants is to get a pay-off from Ashton. She has reached out to Ashton's team.'

The actor and Leal are reported to have hooked up last weekend after partying in San Diego.

The latest alleged encounter happened
on the 12th floor of the Hard Rock Hotel in San Diego, California, in 
the early hours of Saturday – the Hollywood couple’s sixth wedding 
anniversary.

Kutcher and the woman had apparently 
been partying at Fluxx club in the city. One fellow clubgoer said: ‘Ashton 
didn’t look like someone who was celebrating a wedding anniversary.’

Forlorn: Moore posted this picture of herself with eyes closed, looking every inch her 48 years, with the words 'I see through you'

Friends have said Kutcher's marriage to Moore is in crisis with one magazine, Star, saying they have already separated.

Meanwhile, some sources are saying that, should Kutcher and Moore's marriage end, the couple could be battling it out in a bitter $290 million divorce.

Sources also tell Star that Moore and Kutcher have been living largely separate lives, with a source saying it was clear that their marriage was 'beyond help,' when Kutcher visited Moore in New York City recently.

It is the second time Kutcher has been accused of cheating on his  wife.

A year ago Brittney Jones, 21, said 
she had sex with the actor at the Beverly Hills home he shares with his 
wife while she was away.

Moore, who is 15 years senior to her husband, has refused to comment on the claims.

She and her husband were last seen together two months ago.

Her Twitter posts have turned much darker in recent weeks.

Earlier this week she posted a picture of her face with her eyes closed and the words: 'I see through you.'

On that same night of Kutcher's alleged fling, Moore was tweeting from the East Coast, where she is temporarily based.

She shared a quote from Greek philosopher Epictetus on September 23, 
writing: 'When we are offended at any man's fault, turn to yourself and 
study your own failings. Then you will forget your anger.'

Leal has been talking with Beverly 
Hills lawyer Keith Davidson who represented Betty Ford worker Dawn 
Holland following her spat with actress Lohan.

The pay-off wanted by Leal will be 
similar to that negotiated by nightclub hostess Rachel Uchitel after her
affair with Tiger Woods was exposed.

Uchitel,35, received a reported $10m from the golf star in return for not talking about their affair.

She later had to pay back the money 
after appearing on Celebrity Rehab with Tiger's lawyers saying she had 
breached the confidentiality clause.
