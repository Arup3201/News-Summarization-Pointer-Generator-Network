More young women say they would back reality TV star Joey Essex in an election than Nick Clegg, a new poll reveals.

Just 1 per cent of women aged 18-30 surveyed by Cosmopolitan said they admire Mr Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, but 3 per cent said they would consider voting for Essex.

In fact all of Britain’s party leaders proved so unappealing that most young women said they would rather vote for politicians who are from other countries or dead.

More women aged 18-30 said they would back Joey Essex in an election, but just 1 per cent said they admired Nick Clegg

In the damning survey of the so-called ‘millenial’ generation of female voters, MPs were described as self-interested, deceitful and power hungry with just 1 per cent of women believing politicians to be hard-working, intelligent and essential.

Margaret Thatcher is admired by 6 per cent of the women surveyed, while 4 per cent said they would vote for Prime Minister David Cameron.

However, foreign politicians proved much more appealing with Barack Obama being the most admired on 35 per cent, followed by Hillary Clinton on 7 per cent.

The research, based on 1,000 women aged 18-30 surveyed by Cosmopolitan, showed that 3 per cent said they would vote for former TOWIE star Joey Essex in a line-up of alternative candidates.

Almost one in five - 19 per cent – said they would be more willing to vote if there was less lying and spin and if there was politicians they admired and trusted.

Meanwhile 12 per cent want a completely new system and 62 per cent agreed with Russell Brand calling our political system ‘broken’, according to the research.

Among the political parties, Labour was backed by 35 per cent, with the Tories in second on 17 per cent.

Opinion was evenly split between Ukip and the Liberal Democrats with 7 per cent of women choosing to vote for both.

The
 Ukip vote has significant regional variation with the party having most
 sway in East Anglia with 21 per cent of women stating they will vote 
for them compared to no one in the East Midlands.

Political
 parties are not attracting young female talent to their ranks either 
with 84 per cent vowing they would never consider it as a career, the 
survey found.

In
 a list of career choices, being a politician scored marginally more 
than being a stripper. The preferred career choices were teacher or 
doctor, followed by journalist, model and banker.

Louise
 Court, editor-in-chief, Cosmopolitan, said: ‘In the phase of their 
lives that should be the most carefree, millennial women are feeling 
huge concerns about work, unemployment and debt - and no one is 
listening. 

‘British
 politicians have a huge disconnect with young women and have a big 
fight on their hands if they want to win the battle for the millennial 
vote.

‘The
 sad reality is that more and more women will become disengaged as we 
reach the general election. I fear this means few will turn out at the 
ballot box.’

Young women were more impressed by foreign leaders like Barack Obama and those who are not alive, like Margaret Thatcher, than the current crop of British leaders

Toni Pearce, National Union of Students president, said: ‘I've always believed that it's not that young people aren't interested in politics; it's just that many don't find it very accessible at the moment.

‘Our leaders just aren't representative of the society we live in - men outnumber women four to one in Parliament and out of a cabinet of 23, only four are women.

‘How can we trust their decision making on issues that affect us, when most of them probably won't have any first-hand experience of them?

‘If more young people vote, politicians will have no choice but to take notice and serve their interests, which is why everyone should get out to their polling station in the next general election and cast their vote.’
