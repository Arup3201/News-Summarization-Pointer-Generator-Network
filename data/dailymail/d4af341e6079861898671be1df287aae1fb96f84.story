Comedy: Red Nose Day attracts celebrities including Homeland actor Damian Lewis and Dawn French

Comic Relief has revealed that it is selling its shares in tobacco, arms and alcohol companies following an expose of its unethical investment practices.

In a dramatic U-turn following weeks of refusal to change what it does with its funds, the charity has agreed to withdraw millions of pounds from controversial ‘booze, bombs and fags’ funds while an ‘urgent review’ of its policies is carried out.

The temporary block comes as staff try to deal with the huge public backlash caused by the revelations that Comic Relief pumps donations into the companies even as it backs projects to help victims of war, alcohol abuse and smoking-related illnesses.

Despite initially defending the policy on the grounds that ethical investments would generate a smaller return, Comic Relief has now agreed to submit itself to an eight-week inquiry into its investment policies.

The embarrassing turnaround was announced in a low-key press release on its website on Monday.

Its chair Tim Davie – who also heads the BBC’s commercial arm BBC Worldwide – said: ‘As a charity which depends on public trust, it’s absolutely right that we take this opportunity to examine our investment policy thoroughly in view of the concerns which have been raised.’

Comic Relief’s trustees said  the review panel would consist of two independent members, Mr Davie and three Comic Relief trustees.

The meetings will be attended by Four Weddings and a Funeral director Richard Curtis – who  co-founded the charity with comedian Lenny Henry in 1985 – and its £131,000-a-year chief executive Kevin Cahill.

The statement read: ‘Until the review has been concluded, the trustees have decided to withdraw Comic Relief funds from the sections of the investment portfolio which have caused concern, and this process is underway.

‘Comic Relief is committed to finding a solution that allows it to continue to deliver the greatest benefit to the poor and vulnerable people it supports.’

In its initial response to the scandal – exposed by the BBC’s Panorama programme earlier this month – Comic Relief took a very different tone.

At the time, a spokesman said: ‘Because the range of issues we support is so broad, ethical screening would significantly limit our ability to invest as well as seriously increase financial risk.

‘We do not invest directly in any individual company. We believe  this approach has delivered the greatest benefits to the most vulnerable people.’

But after the programme prompted a huge online backlash from members of the public who felt their donations had been misused, Mr Cahill appeared to backtrack and promised he would ‘do the right thing’.

This year’s Red Nose Day raised more than £100million after an eight-hour show on BBC1 and BBC2, fronted by presenters including Lenny Henry, Russell Brand, Jonathan Ross and featuring skits by Henry’s ex-wife Dawn French and Homeland actor Damian Lewis.

But some of the charity’s own stars – including comics Frankie Boyle and Al Murray – have since distanced themselves from its activities, trading jokes about Comic Relief’s connection to companies such as weapons manufacturer BAE Systems and British American Tobacco.

According to Comic Relief’s accounts from 2007 to 2009, it placed millions in ‘blue-chip’ City funds that in turn invested in the firms, including £2.7million in three tobacco firms in 2009.

It is currently sitting on a £100million fund donated by the public despite promising to hand ‘every pound’ straight to good causes in its annual broadcasts.
