Southampton are keen on Javier Hernandez but face a difficult battle to fend off competition from Inter Milan.

The south coast club can offer more cash up front than the Italians in particular but Hernandez would be keen to play European football if he left United.

The Mexican has been continually linked with a move away from Old Trafford and is currently on United's pre-season tour of the USA.

And Southampton boss Ronald Koeman is confident of signing up to three new players in the next week.

Speaking after his side's 3-1 pre-season friendly win over Brighton, he told the Southern Echo: 'We are close to signing two or three new players and we hope to bring them in in the next week,” said Koeman.

'We show our ambition. Of course we lost some good players but that’s part of the life and part of the good season Southampton had last season. Still we are with the same ambition as before.'

Sportsmail revealed that Southampton had asked for Hernandez during talks over a deal for Luke Shaw in June.

In an interview with Corriere dello Sport on Tuesday, he said: 'I know there is much interest in me from the Italian club and I thank them for this.

'There are also other teams and everything obviously is pleasing, but right now I belong to Manchester United and it would be disrespectful to mention other teams even though I do not know what will happen once the tour of the US concludes.

'Do I liked the Nerazzurri? They are a great club, but if I were to transfer, I would not say no to any club. Italian football, however, is amongst the best in the world, I have followed it since I was little and it would be a very important showcase at a personal level.

'I am a professional player, I am committed and working in this direction, ready for any eventuality, but at this moment I cannot say any more.'

Optimistic: Ronald Koeman is confident of signing three new players within a week

Koeman has seen Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert, Dejan Lovren and Luke Shaw leave this summer but is hopeful Morgan Schneiderlin - who was left out of the win over Brighton - will not follow suit.

He added: 'He was not in a good shape to play because he has been training only for five or six days and normally he will play next week against Leverkusen at home. 

'About his situation, we wait. He is a player of Southampton and I hope he will continue as a player of Southampton.'
