A super-fit cage fighter has been given just months to live after being diagnosed with bowel cancer.

Wil Handford, 22, from Burnley, Lancashire, was ‘in the best shape of his life’ - at 6ft 5in and 14st - when he was taken ill.

Within weeks he had lost 2st and was struggling even to eat a bowl of cereal.

He has been hailed as ‘inspirational’ and received hundreds of messages of support after posting a diary of his battle on his blog.

He says his doctors say the cancer is terminal and have given him three to six months.

Bowel cancer is extremely rare in young people.

About three quarters of all case occur in over-65s but Stephen Sutton, 19, from Burntwood, Staffordshire, who has raised £3.1million for charity, also has bowel cancer.

Mr Handford, a mixed martial arts expert learned he had cancer after returning from a boxing training camp in Thailand.

He said he started to suffer agonising stomach pains after a sparring session and couldn’t sleep or eat.

After a few days he visited a local hospital where scans revealed nodules around his abdomen.

Doctors urged him to return to the UK for further tests.

His mother, Karen, met him at Manchester Airport, where he said she looked ‘gutted’ as he ‘looked like a skeleton’.

Bowel cancer is cancer which starts in the large bowel.

It is sometimes also called colon cancer or rectal cancer.

Symptoms include blood in the stools, a change in bowel habits, abdominal pain and unexplained weight loss.

As the disease progresses, it can also cause fatigue and breathlessness.

Bowel cancer is the third most common type of cancer in England and there are about 40,000 cases diagnosed every year.

Approximately 72 per cent of bowel cancer cases occur in people who are over 65.

People who are older, who eat a diet low in fibre and high in fat, those who are overweight and those who take little exercise are most at risk.

People who smoke and drink a lot of alcohol, as well as those with a family history of the disease, are also at increased risk.

She took him straight to Royal Blackburn Hospital where he spent two weeks.

Doctors then gave him the devastating news he had bowel cancer which had spread through his abdomen and his colon.

Describing the moment, Mr Handford said: ‘After that, they went on to give more and more bad news. They said because of the severity of it they couldn’t operate.

‘There were a few big tumours. They said all they could offer is to try to reduce it to prolong my life.

‘When you’re sat there and they’re telling you this, it’s hard to clock in your head. I said: “So you’re telling me I’m going to die from this?” and they just said “yeah”.

‘They said at this stage if you do nothing at all, it’s really aggressive. You’ve lasted as long as you have because you’re young and fit. You’ve probably got three to six months. I was just sat there gobsmacked.’

But Mr Handford, who had hopes of becoming a plumber, has vowed to ‘keep his chin up’ and not let cancer beat him.

And he said his whole family, including his mother Karen, twin sister Catherine, little brother Eduard, and long-term girlfriend Rose Barrowclough, are backing him in his ultimate battle.

He said: ‘You’ve got to keep fighting, chin up. I’ve had loads of support and it’s great to know you’ve got people that care for you.

‘But you’ve got to keep the fight and I will be doing that.

'It was tough telling my family, my sister, my girlfriend, all my friends. It’s horrendous news for everyone.

Mr Handford saw doctors in Thailand when he first experienced symptoms and they urged him to fly home for further tests. As soon as he arrived in the UK his mother took him to hospital where he was diagnosed

‘But I’m trying to be confident about it, trying not to get down. That helps everyone in the house.

Messages of support for Mr Handford have flooded in from Facebook users.
