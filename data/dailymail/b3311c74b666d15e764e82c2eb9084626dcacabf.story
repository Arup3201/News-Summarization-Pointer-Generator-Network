A Second World War veteran who at 89-years-old is Europe’s oldest McDonald’s worker is still ‘lovin’ it’ – and claims he will never quit his beloved job.

War veteran Bill Dudley – nicknamed ‘Old McDonald’ by his wife - says he loves his job so much that he has no plans to quit the fast-food joint and will work there until he ‘gets too old to manage at all’.

The great-grandfather, who was awarded a medal last year for his heroism during the Second World War, doesn’t feel ready to retire yet and wants to carry on for as long as possible.

War veteran Bill Dudley - nicknamed 'Old McDonald' by his wife - says he loves his job so much that he has no plans to quit the fast-food joint and will work there until he 'gets too old to manage at all'

The 89-year-old, from Connah's Quay, North Wales, was awarded a medal last year for his heroism during the Second World War. He narrowly escaped death when a torpedo came close to hitting his ship during battle

The 89-year-old, from Connah’s Quay, North Wales, is older than anyone else in Europe’s 7,500 McDonald’s outlets and has worked at the fast food chain for the last eight years.

He said: ‘I really enjoy it - I look forward to going to work.

‘I think I would be lost without the job. I love working with the staff and meeting the customers.

‘It is a great staff that we work with - they are all quite young and I think some of them see me as the father of the group.

‘I used to be in the Royal Navy, and I like to think of all the staff as a crew.’

He celebrated his birthday with staff and customers at the Mold, North Wales, branch of the restaurant yesterday.

And his wife Margaret, 70, may call him ‘Old Mcdonald’, but Mr Dudley said he hasn’t taken the record for the oldest in the world yet.

He said: ‘There’s one staff member in America who is 100 - he opens and closes the door. According to my boss, though I’m the oldest in the UK and probably in Europe.

Mr Dudley, who works a six-hour shift on a Wednesday and Thursday at the restaurant, said: 'For my birthday they brought a cake in, I was given a bottle of whisky, cards and we put a few balloons up'

‘I will carry on until I fall - I will only give up when I get too old to manage at all.’

Mr Dudley works a six-hour shift on a Wednesday and Thursday at the restaurant.

He said: ‘I work in customer care, so I say hello when they come in, open the door if they’re struggling with prams or anything and clear trays and tables.

‘For my birthday they brought a cake in, I was given a bottle of whisky, cards and we put a few balloons up.’

Franchisee Stewart Williams said: ‘Bill is an inspiring member of the team, who engages with our customers on every visit.

‘All our staff are incredibly proud to work alongside him and is a very valued member of the team.

‘He has been working at McDonald’s for over six years now as a part-time customer care assistant.

‘We look forward to celebrating his 90th birthday here next year.’

Last year, Mr Dudley, who has two sons, 14 grandchildren and four great grandchildren, was awarded the Arctic Medal for his service during the Second World War, left. He is Europe's oldest McDonald's worker, right

Last year, Mr Dudley, who has two sons, 14 grandchildren and four great grandchildren, was awarded the Arctic Medal for his service during the Second World War.

He narrowly escaped death when a torpedo came close to hitting his ship during battle - but he forgave the pilot when he met him nearly 50 years later.

He said: ‘I saw this aircraft coming towards us and it dropped the torpedo.

‘I saw his face - he was so close to me - and that is one of the most vivid memories I have of the war, I thought this is it, this is the end.

‘Years later he saw an article in one of the magazines we used to produce and got in touch with Peter

Lyons, who was also on the ship. He came over and about 40 of us went down to Torquay, Devon, to see him.’

He said there were no feelings of anger between them, despite the German pilot’s attempts to kill all on board HMS Nairana.

After leaving the Royal Navy, Bill went on to work at Airbus for a decade, British Steel for 35 years and then as a taxi driver for ABA Car in Shotton for more than 15 years.

Oil rig worker:

Pat Thomson, 72, braves 90 mile per hour winds, lightning storms and works half way around the world as Britain’s oldest oil rig worker.

The great-grandmother, known as ‘Auntie Pat’ or ‘The Queen’ by her rig workers, left her job as a primary school teacher and joined a BP rig in 1984.

She has worked there ever since and has spent the last 30 years travelling the world for her job – visiting locations from the Falkland Islands to Gabon, West Africa.

The mother-of-three from Matlock, Derbyshire, earns around £700-a-day and says she won’t give it up because she loves a challenge too much.

Syd Prior worked as a greeter at B&Q for more than 20 years, right up until his 97th birthday, and said the job helped to keep him young

Shop worker:

Britain's oldest shop worker Syd Prior retired in 2011 days before reaching his 97th birthday.

Syd Prior had been working as a greeter at B&Q for more than 20 years and said the job helped to keep him young.

He started working at the hardware retailer's Wimbledon branch aged 76, but later moved to its flagship superstore at New Malden.

From 1939 to 1945 he served with the Royal Corps of Signalmen in North Africa and Italy.

Sara Dappen, from Story City, Iowa, is one of America's oldest McDonald's workers and is still employed at her local branch at the age of 92

At the end of the Second World War he became a salesman for a machinery company and his nephew's grocery.

After his nephew left the country he took a job at B&Q as a hobby. But that hobby turned into 21 years of dedicated service.

Mr Prior had not been unemployed since he was 14 and said hard work is the secret to happiness and long life.

The (other) McDonald's worker:

While Bill Dudley is the oldest McDonald's worker in Europe, he is not quite the oldest fast-food worker in the world.

He is pipped to the post for that title by 92-year-old Sara Dappen who is one of the oldest people to work in McDonald's in America.

She has worked at a branch in Story City, Iowa, for more than five years.

She too cleans tables and tidies up after customers, but she said her favourite thing to do was to chat with the people who eat in the restaurant.

Nursery administrator:

Sprightly Ada Hostler was one of the oldest female employees in the UK up until recently - working full-time at the ripe old age of 94.

The great-grandmother from Portsmouth, Hampshire, put in a 45-hour week in her role as administrator for Portsmouth-based Storytime Nursery.

Despite breaking her hip in 2010, she continued to work at the nursery, which is run by her daughter Janet Storey, 63, for 19 years.

In 2011 she said she lives by the motto 'you're a long time dead' and said she even gets irritated by weekends - because she wants to work.

However, she recently decided to take a step back from her full workload and now spends time with family and friends.

Van cleaner:

Buster Martin worked as a van cleaner right up until his death, aged 104.

Mr Martin was one of Britain’s oldest workers when he died in 2011 shortly after clocking off from a final shift at the office.

The van cleaner, who completed the London Marathon in 2008 at the age of 101, worked at

London-based Pimlico Plumbers for five years before his death.  

The hard working employee refused to retire and even reported for work on his 100th birthday. He relaxed by enjoying 'a beer or two and 20 cigarettes daily'.

Announcing his death in April 2011, Pimlico Plumbers managing director Charlie Mullins said: 'I can't believe it. Only yesterday afternoon he was in the canteen knocking back one of Buster's Beers, and now today he is gone.’
