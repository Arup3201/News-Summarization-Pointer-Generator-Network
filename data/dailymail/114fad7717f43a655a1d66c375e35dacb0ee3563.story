It seemed that all bets were off when Kate appeared to refer to her 'daughter' during a trip to Grimsby in March, and despite the Palace denying that anybody - even Kate - knew the sex of the baby many bookies paid out and an army of pink teddy bears and princess dresses were ordered.

Then earlier this week there was a flurry of new activity as rumours that Prince Harry had confirmed that the baby was a boy swirled and hundreds of punters placed bets on the royal baby being male.

Now, new images released today suggest that a certain very important royal might be in on the secret.

The picture of the Queen and Kate dressed in dungarees appearing to paint a nursery are part of a spoof shoot to celebrate the launch of Ladbrokes' Royal Baby Odds.

The bookmakers has launched a collection of Royal Baby Odds and is taking bets on the sex of the royal baby, the name of the royal baby, the hair colour of the royal baby and even the job prospects of the royal baby.

The bookies still favour Kate to give 
birth to a girl at 2-5 with a boy at 2-1, and Elizabeth, Alexandra and Diana are the front-runners for the baby's name at 6-1 if
it's a girl as well as George at 10-1 or Charles at 12-1 if it's a boy.

More off the wall odds offered to royal fans include Kate giving birth on the same day as Kim Kardashian (50/1), the prince or princess competing for Great Britain  n the Olympic Games  one day(100/1) and Closer magazine to run the exclusive baby pictures (66/1).

To celebrate their rather extensive Betting List the firm commissioned a tongue-in-cheek photoshoot showing some of the doting family's best doppelgangers prepping for the new arrival.

In another, Kate's lookalike is spotted dipping gherkins in vanilla ice cream while her sister 'Pippa' reads from a Baby Names book.

And in a final scene the royal baby shower descends in to chaos as the Queen starts taking bets on the name of the third-in-line to the throne.

Ladbrokes commissioned the pictures using look-a-likes of the Duchess and her nearest and dearest to show what the Royal family might be doing in the run up to the birth.

They wanted the images to reflect the fact the nation has been kept guessing about the sex of the baby ever since the tight-lipped couple announced Kate was expecting just before Christmas.

They are expecting feverish betting around the date of birth, the time of birth either in the morning or afternoon, the baby's hair colour and whether Kate gives birth naturally or by caesarean.

There’s odds of 7-1 that the newborn will have ginger hair like their uncle Harry or 10-1 that they will be bald like their daddy.

Ladbrokes make it just a 2-1 shot that the baby follows in the footsteps of other Royals with a career in the military, or for the optimistic out there it’s a 5000-1 chance they go on to represent England at Wembley one day.

Ladbrokes spokeswoman Jessica Bridge said: 'The excitement is building but it looks like the Royal couple are going to keep us guessing until the birth. The money suggests they’re expecting a girl called Elizabeth, but after Harry’s recent gaffe punters are backing the baby to be a boy in their droves.'
