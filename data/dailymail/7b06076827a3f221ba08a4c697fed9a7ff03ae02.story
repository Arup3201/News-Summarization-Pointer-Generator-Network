An Australian girl who fell in love with London when she moved here has had a detailed map of her favourite park tattooed on her thigh.

Jessica Pinney, 28, said walks through Richmond Park, the largest of London's eight Royal Parks, helped her beat depression when she lived in England.

Although she's now back in Melbourne, she says the park is still part of her.

After splashing out £185 on the painstaking picture, she explained: 'I feel like Richmond Park is my home and I wanted to have it tattooed on me so it's always with me and I'm kind of always there.

'It'll be hilarious if I ever get asked for directions in the park again - I can pull down my trousers or pull up my skirt and give them some really good advice.'

Miss Pinney came to live with her parents in Richmond in 2004 when she went through a major depressive episode and would visit the park every day to help her cope.

She said: 'I went to the park every day and it made everything bearable. Since then I've never felt as at ease or as at home as I do when I'm in the park.

'I learned everything I could and am still learning about it and the wildlife there.

'I got obsessed with the rut and all the seasonal changes and the different birds and waterfowl there.'

Miss Pinney, who works as a sound artist, had the park inked on her left thigh in a three-and-a-half hour session by Melbourne tattoo artist Olivia Brumen.

She said: 'At first it didn't hurt much but after the first hour or so my skin got incredibly sensitive and the rest of the time was a quite torturous. It was worth it though.

'It was a lot of work for the artist - she did such an amazing job of all that detail and line work.'

The tattoo combines the current map of 
the park with an older one and includes some personal place names such 
as Witchy Woods, instead of Sidmouth Wood.

She paid £185 for the design and plans to get some red or fallow deer antlers on the inside of her arm when she returns to Richmond in August.
