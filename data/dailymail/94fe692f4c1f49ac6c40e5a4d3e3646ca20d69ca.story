It's the vital ingredient which ensures Christmas dinner will go with ... well, a bang. 

This year we will pull apart 300 million crackers – that’s five for every person in the country – at a total cost of £60 million.

That’s an awful lot of feeble puns, cheap toys and flimsy paper hats that disintegrate as soon as you try to get them around your head.

Adam Lee-Potter (right) had his daughter Dory (left) put a range of Christmas crackers to the test. She found that Poundland's budget set of eight for a quid topped Harrods' set of six which cost over 130 times as much

Poundland's crackers might come with flimsy hats but they let out a great 'crack' and won't hurt your pocket

But high-end versions are also available. One luxury-goods website has launched a set of six for £4 million with gifts including Cartier necklaces, an Aston Martin coupé and a Sunseeker yacht ... but no jokes.

Even the Royal Family’s meal is said to feature crackers, with the Queen believed to be especially fond of finding musical toys.

Co-op's crackers promise more than they deliver, while Sainsbury's have an excellent bang and funky hats

At the other end of the scale, Poundland is offering eight crackers for a quid.

Here we’ve put those budget versions, as well as supermarket favourites and designs from top-end stores, to the ultimate test – trying to impress my eight-year-old daughter, Dory.

The most expensive we tested came from Harrods, which is selling a set of six for £99.50.

Morrisons' family version are better than their luxury range, while you can't quibble with Tesco's 33p a pull

To make comparisons easier, we’ve calculated the cost per cracker, as they are variously sold in packs of six, eight or 12.

Extraordinarily, Poundland comes out ahead of the luxury store – whose crackers cost more than 130 times as much. That, at least is Dory’s verdict in our entirely subjective test.

Dory and I pulled the crackers apart to gauge the quality of the jokes, toys and hat within – and to ensure that the cracker gives that all-important satisfying bang.

Conran's crackers are questionable value at nearly £15 a pull. Fortnum & Mason's are cheaper, and special

Crackers were invented in 1847 by Cockney confectioner Thomas Smith to shift his bon-bons – sugared almonds wrapped in tissue paper. He was said to have been inspired to add the ‘crack’ after hearing the crackle of a log on a fire.

Other traditional elements – the gifts and paper hats – have been around since the days of Smith’s son, Walter, who introduced them to differentiate his product from a burgeoning number of rivals.

Waitrose offer 'cracking hats', but M&S' fare are not great value and look like 'cheap Scottish shortbread'
