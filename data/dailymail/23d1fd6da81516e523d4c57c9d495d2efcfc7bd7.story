Group B kicks off on Friday night.

The perceived wisdom is that Spain and Holland will prevail.

But Chile are potential dark horses, not just for the group but to make it to the latter stages - even the semi finals.

The heat is on: Holland boss Louis van Gaal is under pressure to make sure his side get out of the group

New Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal could well face humiliation if he doesn’t take the Dutch to the knockout phase.

Chile’s coach Jorge Sampaoli promotes a high tempo, pressing, passing game that sees his team evolve from 3-3-1-3 to 4-3-3 in the blink of an eye.

Looking to shock: Arturo Vidal and Alexis Sanchez hope to help Chile progress from their group

Chile who should give Australia a bloody nose on Friday are a team to watch if they don’t suffer stage fright like Colombia in 1994.

They can certainly shake up this group and in Barcelona’s Alexis Sanchez they have a top class player.

It is to be
 hoped that, despite the revelations of FIFA corruption and worries 
about security, safety and anti-state angst in Brazil, joga bonito comes to the fore.

But
 it can be revealed that even though FIFA president Sepp Blatter has 
been endorsed by his cronies to stay on as president for another term, 
UEFA boss Michel Platini WILL run against him in the autumn.

Drifting apart: UEFA president  Michel Platini has refused to back FIFA's Sepp Blatter and may run against him

Kicking off in style: Claudia Leitte and Jennifer Lopez perform during the Opening Ceremony of the World Cup

Up and running: The World Cup was officially opened on Thursday

Part of the ticket will be to strip Qatar of the 2022 finals and cleanse FIFA of a brown paper envelope ethos.

The FA want England to take over those finals. And despite denials have a strong chance not least because of cost.

FA chairman Greg Dyke now sees that as his raison d’etre.

Football's coming home? FA Chairman Greg Dyke is keen to bring the 2022 World Cup to England if there is a re-vote

But it understood that Australia would be the politically pragmatic choice.

I understand China and India will also make new bids, if - and it will happen - there is a new vote for the 2022 finals.

I’m looking forward to seeing Tim Cahill – remember him? - in action for the Socceroos.

I reckon the ex-Millwall and Everton star, now with New York Red Bulls, could make an impact even if the Aussies eventually are overcome by chirpy Chile.

These are Tim’s Twitter thoughts (if that is not an oxymoron).

From a land Down Under: Tim Cahill is one of the most experienced players in the Australia squad

National pride: Cahil is active on Twitter and posted this picture to show his dedication to the cause

Carlos Vela has not made Mexico’s World Cup squad, which is probably just as well for Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger.

Wenger insists he doesn’t like buying players on the evidence of international tournaments. Even a World Cup.

So it would seem reports that Vela could return to the Gunners for £3.5 million from Real Sociedad are on the money.

Return: Carlos Vela has been linked with a move back to Arsenal from Real Sociedad

Reports that Roger Milla, now perhaps aged 65-and-a-half, at least, will make a comeback this summer after his exploits at Italia 90 have been grossly exaggerated,

However don’t dismiss the notion that the spring chicken that is Samuel Eto’o might still make an impact this summer for Cameroon.

And if Eto'o does notch - maybe against Mexico - then he must, please, pay homage to Milla and dance by the corner flag. Play it again Sam.

Dance star: Roger Milla was famed for his dance by the corner flag during the World Cup in 1990

Food for thought:

With Mexico playing on Friday night, here is a an easy fajitas recipe

Method

Turn on oven to 200 degree celsius and wrap the tortillas in tin foil.

Finely slice the chicken pieces and onion and pepper.

Mix these together in a bowl and then add the marinade ingredients in the listed order.

Heat a griddle pan until hot and put the tortillas in the oven wrapped in the foil. Add contents of the mixing bowl to the pan and keep them moving over a high heat using tongs so you get a nice charring effect.

Check the chicken is cooked all the way through and there are no raw parts. The idea is to get chicken that is still moist but charred on the outside, which requires the pan to be very hot.

Once cooked tip the pan contents into a large bowl and serve with the heated tortillas (they should have been in the oven around 8 mins), salad and salsa.

Wine or Beer?

Wine:Chile vs Australia:

Chile: Co-op Truly , Sauvignon Blanc, Leyda Valley  vs Australia: Brookford Charodonnay/ Semillion South East.

Beer:Escudos vs Victoria Bitter (VB)

World Cup Moment:

Let’s not forget in the Seventies the English had to support Scotland at World Cup finals.

Well some of us anyway.

Goal to remember: Archie Gemmill celebrates his stunning goal for Scotland against Holland in 1978

And was there ever a finer moment than Archie Gemmill scoring THAT goal against Holland which has since been immortalised in the iconic movie Trainspotting.

Let’s see if we can pull the, er, correct video from the vaults.
