Be afraid, be very afraid. A spooky mansion that looks like the Addams Family house is on sale in Sydney's trendy suburb of Paddington.

It is the first time the 19th century home has gone on sale since the 1920s.

Originally built as a farmhouse, the mansion boats five bedrooms, a large kitchen, two bathrooms and 3.3m high ceilings, but needs extensive work.

Nicknamed the 'Addams Family' the five bedroom house at 284 Moore Park Rd, Paddington needs plenty of TLC

Rich in history, it was built during the 1800s as a farmhouse before being converted into a gentleman’s residence in 1873

Perfect for sports loving renovators looking for a a challenge, the mansion sits opposite the Sydney Cricket Ground, Allianz Stadium and the Entertainment Quarter and is one of the biggest blocks on the street.

Set on nearly 400sq m of land the Queen Anne style home features a classic entry 
hall; five bedrooms; grand reception rooms; a large dine-in kitchen; 
a sun room; a family room with enclosed verandah and two bathrooms.

The three story home is named the 'Verulum' which is the ancient name for London, and has been lived in for the past ninety years by one of the daughters of the original owner.

Although of mid Victorian origins, the building's façade reflects a Queen Anne style

The current owner has lived in the mansion for 90 years

Did we mention the stables? This property also has stables that can be converted into a granny flat or a large triple lock-up garage; a rarity on the streets of Paddington.

The Verulum was built as a farmhouse before being converted into a residential property in 1873.

It featured fine fittings and dimensions, many which still remain today.

The home is expected to go for more than $2 million when it goes to auction on September 11.

During the 1880s other buildings were being erected in Paddington near the tram line and the Victoria Barracks.

The house has a cellar that during World War II became the family's air raid shelter and a safe house
