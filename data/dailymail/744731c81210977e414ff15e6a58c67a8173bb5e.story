Eileen Metcalfe claimed David Hughes - who died suddenly aged 26 in 2009 - was behind the wheel of her car when she was caught doing 36mph in a 30 zone

A grandmother attempted to get out of a speeding ticket by claiming a dead man had been behind the wheel.

Eileen Metcalfe, 55, from Hartlepool, County Durham, was caught driving 36mph in a 30mph zone near to her home in May last year.

The grandmother, who already had nine points on her licence, claimed David Hughes - who died suddenly aged 26 in 2009 - was behind the wheel at the time.

Correspondence was sent to Mr Hughes - but was then returned by the new tenant of his former home.

Following an inquiry, it was discovered the information submitted by Metcalfe could not be true and bought her in for questioning.

There, Metcalfe told probation workers she thought Mr Hughes' family would 'find it funny', Teesside Crown Court heard.

She later claimed she was filling in the 
speeding form at the same time as ordering a commemorative urn for Mr 
Hughes and got mixed up.

Metcalfe was due to deny the charge of perverting the course of justice and was facing a trial last month when she changed her plea.

The judge, Recorder Graeme Cook, gave 
the grandmother an indication last month that she would not be locked up
 if she pleaded guilty.

However, Metcalfe was given an eight-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, with supervision.

After reading a report from
 the Probation Service following an interview they had with her, he said
 he felt like changing his mind.

During the session, Metcalfe showed no remorse, had no understanding how her crime had caused heartache, and found it humorous.

The judge said: 'I believe you deliberately went out to avoid any points on your licence.

'Your explanation, which I saw in your defence statement, I find that nonsensical, and I do not accept it for one second.

'The
 person whose details you gave had been dead for some four years. One 
can only imagine what the family of Mr Hughes went through.

Teeside Crown Court (pictured) heard how the grandmother claimed she'd accidentally entered Mr Hughes's name into speeding forms as she was ordering a commemorative urn for him at the same time

'Had I known a lot of this from the pre-sentence report about you, I may well have had a different view about immediate custody.

'You
 seem to have a total lack of conscience, a total lack of regard for the
 offending you carried out and the effect it might have on the 
deceased's family, and you say they might have found it funny.'

Ian Mullarkey, mitigating, told the court Metcalfe had 'a number of challenges' and is the carer for two of her 11 grandchildren.

After the hearing,Metcalfe still maintained it had been a mix-up.

'I had a form for the urn and the speeding form on the table, it's a madhouse in here at times, and I put the wrong name in,' she said.

After the case, Mr Hughes's distraught mother, Evelyn, said: 'I can't believe she could do this - how she could be so cruel.'

'It's devastating,
 it's disgusting, more so because she was a friend of David's. I don't 
know how she thought we'd find it funny.'
