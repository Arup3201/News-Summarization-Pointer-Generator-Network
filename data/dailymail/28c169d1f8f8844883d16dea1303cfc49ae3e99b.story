The lookalike brother of tragic Fast and The Furious star Paul Walker is being lined up for a recurring role in the hit box office franchise after stepping in for the star.

Cody, 25, agreed to film crucial scenes for the Fast and The Furious 7 following the star's death in November as a tribute to his older brother.

And a production source tells MailOnline that Cody will be given a role in future movies, saying: 'Paul's character Brian O'Conner will be seen retiring, while his younger brother will join the crew.'

'Of course, Cody isn’t a replacement for 
Paul in any way, but the producers were really grateful that he stepped 
in to help them finish this last film and Cody so likeable and 
charming.

'It would be a tribute to Paul that Cody carries on the Walker name in the Fast and The Furious movies.'

Cody was seen sharing a tender embrace with actress Jordanna Brewster, who plays Paul's wife in the franchise, and the pair were joined by a young boy who plays her son while filming on the beach in Malibu, California, last month.

It appeared the co-stars were filming a happy ending for the upcoming film as the trio appeared to be in high spirits.

Breaking
 his silence on his brother's death for the first time, Cody - who 
filmed extra scenes alongside his older brother Caleb, 36 - said in 
April: 'It still doesn't feel real because sometimes, working in this 
industry, making films, he'd be away from his family three, four, six 
months at at time.

My only 
interaction would be a phone call. I know it's going to take a while, 
it's going to take a few years before it feels real.'

In
 tears, Cody added: 'Anyone that ever met Paul, he'd never met a 
stranger in his life. If you didn't recognise him out in public, he'd 
never mention it, he was so low key, just lived a modest life.

'He'd
 tell me how jealous of me he was, because I still had my anonymity. 
He's say 'I can't just go to the movies and catch the film i want to 
see, you still got that man', it was so funny to hear that.'

Paul's
 co-star Jordanna - who recently became a mother to son Julian via a 
surrogate in September 2013 -  also made it clear just how much he meant
 to her when she spoke at the MTV Movie Awards.

Jordanna, who plays Mia Toretto, said of the late actor: 'I was lucky enough to work with him for 
over the last 15 years and witnessed the generosity of his heart every 
day I was with him.

Filming
 of the Fast and the Furious 7 went on hiatus following Paul's death, 
although filming later resumed after it was decided that Paul 
would have wanted to see the project through to completion.

MailOnline 
exclusively revealed on December 13 that Cody Walker had been asked to step in and help complete the film.

Producers

 then released a statement confirming that both Cody, a trained actor 
and stuntman, and Caleb will play vital roles in the seventh movie of 
the hit
 franchise.

In
 a statement released on the film's Facebook page in April, fans were 
introduced to the newest members of the Fast & Furious 'family,' 
ahead of the film's April 10, 2015 release day.

And
 filming the emotional scenes, it appeared that Cody was channeling his 
brother's selfless spirit as he lifted his young co-star up on his 
shoulders.
