Police Constable Gareth Browning is in critical but stable condition in hospital after allegedly being run over while trying to stop a stolen car

Three people have been arrested after a police officer was allegedly hit by a stolen car leaving him in critical condition.

PC Gareth Browning was his by a black Mazda Areosport as he tried to stop the car at around 5.30pm on Saturday.

One man, 28, and a 31-year-old woman have been arrested today on suspicion of attempted murder.

A third suspect, a 34-year-old woman, has been detained on suspicion of assisting an offender. All three, from Reading, are in custody.

PC Browning is in a critical but stable condition in the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford. His family, thought to be from Thatcham, Berkshire, are at his bedside.

Browning and his colleague were on foot patrol on Lower Early Way in Reading on Saturday when they saw the car, which had been stolen from a house 10 days earlier, speeding around a residential area.

They tried to stop it by throwing a stop stick, similar to a stinger, into the road but the car swerved onto the pavement and hit Browning so hard he was thrown into the air.

He is believed to have landed on his his head, causing severe injuries. As his colleague ran to help the driver avoided the stinger, escaped, and the vehicle was found abandoned a short time later.

Thames Valley Police’s Assistant Chief Constable, John Campbell, said: 'That officer went on duty that afternoon with the sole purpose of protecting the public and he’s ended up in a very seriously ill condition in hospital.

'His family are very shocked by what has gone on and we are offering them all the support we can.

According to police a stolen car similar to this one was used to ram PC Browning during the attack

'His colleagues are also shocked and upset by what has happened. Professionally, they are continuing with the job as we always do when there are tragic consequences. It's had an impact but we carry on as you would expect.'

PC Browning works at Loddon Valley Police Station where he has served for 10 years.

The 07-registered Mazda was stolen during a burglary in the affluent area of Sonning Common on November 21.

Thieves broke into the property and took the keys before making off with the car.

Police are still appealing for witnesses anybody with information is asked to call 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
