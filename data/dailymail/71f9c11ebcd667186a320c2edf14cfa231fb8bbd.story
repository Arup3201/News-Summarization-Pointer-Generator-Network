Forgotten Manchester City striker Alvaro Negredo is the man whose permanent switch to Valencia next summer has made his old club’s pursuit of Swansea City’s Wilfried Bony possible this month, it has emerged.

City are currently in the process of talking to Swansea about a £25million-£30m deal for Ivory Coast striker Bony and hope to conclude the deal in the coming days.

It is possible that City may recoup some of the money by selling striker Stevan Jovetic - possibly back to Italy - before the end of the January transfer window but it is another deal that is enabling the Barclays Premier League champions to stay within UEFA restrictions handed down last May after the club failed to meet Financial Fair Play guidelines.

As well as limiting City’s Champions League squad to 21 players for this season, UEFA also decreed that the English club must not spent more than £49m net over last summer and this January.

At first glance, City’s deal for Bony would appear to take their net spending significantly higher than that, given last summer’s investment in defender Eliaquim Mangala - a deal actually worth £40m - and midfielder Fernando, who cost £12m.

However it is understood that the £25m City are due to receive from Valencia for Negredo this coming summer has also been taken in to consideration by UEFA. Negredo is currently on loan at the Spanish club from City but a fee of £25m has already been agreed and signed off for the end of the season.
