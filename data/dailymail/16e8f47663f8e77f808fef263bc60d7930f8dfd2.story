Novak Djokovic will skip Serbia's Davis Cup clash against India next weekend, citing 'fatigue' following a gruelling year.

Djokovic has been out of sorts since winning his seventh grand slam at Wimbledon in July and suffered a shock defeat in the semi-finals of the US Open to Kei Nishikori over the weekend.

The world number one is usually a regular feature for Serbia in the Davis Cup and was originally named in the four-man squad as the country bid to get themselves back in the world group for next year.

However, Serbia coach Bogdan Obradovic has revealed Djokovic will play no part in the play-off in Bangalore.

Obradovic told the Tennis Federation of Serbia's official website: 'Our best player Novak Djokovic will definitely not join us in India and his fatigue is the biggest reason.

'Novak has had a very hard part of the season and he needs a break. A trip to India requires enormous effort, not only in terms of travel - coming from one to the other end of the globe, from New York to Bangalore - but difficult conditions to play here, high humidity and high altitude.

'Novak will be cheering for us from the bottom of his heart.'

The news is a fresh blow for Serbia, winners of the Davis Cup in 2010 with Djokovic playing a starring role, as they were already without Janko Tipsarevic and Viktor Troicki.
