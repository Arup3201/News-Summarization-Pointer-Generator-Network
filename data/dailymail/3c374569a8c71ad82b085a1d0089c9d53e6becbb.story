Arrested: Model Samantha Scarlino was a finalist in the Miss Italia beauty competition and is now a TV host

A Miss Italia beauty queen has been arrested as part of an alleged cocaine trafficking ring importing vast quantities of the drug from South America to Europe. 

Model Samantha Scarlino, who was a finalist in the beauty competition, was arrested at a Milan hotel, accused of offences related to the importation of 500 kg of the Class A drug.

Prosecutors believe the cocaine seized was destined for Italy, Belgium, Holland, Spain and France.

The 32-year-old is accused of transporting several deliveries of cash from Italy to gang bosses in Peru to be handed on the drug cartels.

A 60-year-old kingpin from Milan is now wanted by police.

The pageant contestant, who is well known in her home region of Puglia as a TV showgirl and film actress, was one of 22 arrested in connection with the ring. Charges include drug trafficking,  and production.

Miss Scarlino was a finalist in the 1999 Miss Italia competition aged just 17.

She told judges she wanted to be an actress saying ‘what’s missing is a good film with a female protagonist.’

The Miss Italy competition, a national institution that had endured for 70 years, was axed from state broadcaster Rai this year, a year after the bikini round was ditched in favour of old fashioned bathing costumes.

Programmers said the competition was not longer ‘in line with the times.'

Peru hit the headlines earlier this year when drug mules Michaella Connolly and Melissa Reid were arrested for drug trafficking in Lima.

Both are now facing a lengthy spell behind bars in the South American country after admitting trying to smuggle £1.5million worth of cocaine.

More than 30 British nationals are currently in prison in Peru for drugs offences which has become notorious even compared to it's neighbours Mexico and Columbia in the war against drugs.
