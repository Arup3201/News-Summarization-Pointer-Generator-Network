A teenager has been charged with the murder of a ten-year-old boy who was gunned down during a nail salon robbery in Miami.

Aaron Vu died from his injuries after two armed men burst into his parents' business and sprayed bullets around the store, also injuring his 42-year-old father Hai Vu.

Miami-Dade police said last night they had arrested and charged 19-year-old Anthawn Ragan Jr with first-degree murder with a firearm, attempted murder with a firearm, armed robbery with a firearm and aggravated assault with a firearm.

He has also been accused of battery on a law enforcement officer after allegedly becoming violent when he was apprehended at around 6am yesterday at a family member's home on his 19th birthday.

He was questioned at Miami-Dade Police Station and is being held without bond.

Ragan is also linked to a robbery in north Miami and has a long criminal history, it was reported by NBC Miami.

Two intruders were caught on a surveillance camera entering the Hong Kong Nail Salon at 14832 Northwest 7th Avenue at around 7.30pm on Friday with their guns drawn and then fleeing, but not before spraying the inside of the store with bullets.

Manhunt: The gunmen, one of them masked, got away with purses, cell phones and an unspecified sum of cash, and fled in a Dodge Ram pickup truck

Aaron and his father were flown to 
Jackson Memorial Hospital, where the 10-year-old was pronounced dead 
from his injuries a short time later, the station WSVN reported.

According
 to investigators, the unidentified gunmen, one of whom was wearing a 
mask, got away with customers' purses, cell phones and an unspecified 
sum of cash.

They took off in an unknown direction in a black Dodge Ram pick-up truck, police told NBC Miami.

Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers is offering a $25,000 reward for information leading to an arrest as police hunt a second suspect.

Speaking from hospital, Mr Vu said: 'Why did this have to happen? Why couldn’t it just have been me? They killed an innocent child.'

Meanwhile, hundreds from the community came together at the nail salon yesterday for an emotional tribute to Aaron.

Small tribute: A makeshift memorial has sprung up in front of the salon in honor of the slain little boy who was described as funny and outgoing

After the shooting, Aaron
 Vu's fifth-grade classmate, Paul Namphy, said his friend was outgoing 
and loved making everyone laugh, including his teachers. 

Namphy was speaking outside the shuttered nail salon on Saturday, where a makeshift memorial made up of bouquets of flowers and a Teddy bear has sprung up.

Police investigating the deadly heist distributed fliers to the owners of nearby businesses and released the surveillance video showing the pair of suspects.

‘I hope the people in the community are as outraged as we are,’ Lt. Jim Tietz, of the Miami-Dade Police told CBS Miami.

‘These people need to be caught. They need to be taken off the street if they’ve done it once they’ll do it again and anybody could be a victim.’

Salon employees and customers told Miami Herald Hai and Lynn Vu, Aaron’s parents, have been running the popular business for at least five years.
