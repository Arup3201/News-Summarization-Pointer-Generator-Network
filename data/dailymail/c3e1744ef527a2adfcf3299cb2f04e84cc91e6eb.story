'Most people my age can't feel anything,’ one of the oldest licensed physicians practicing medicine in the U.S. told a crowd of friends and family gathered for his 100th birthday party. ‘They're dead.’

Dr Fred Goldman, of Cincinnati, Ohio, has been a doctor since 1935 when Sigmund Freud was still practising - and still sees 12 patients a day in his computer-free suite which he calls ‘the dump’.

The 100-year-old physician still makes house calls and has no plans to give up his work - although he did cut back from five eight-hour days a week to three at the age of 96.

On December 12 his patients, friends and family - some using walkers, some in strollers - gathered at his office for a surprise birthday party. He ended up surprising them by arriving 90 minutes early.

‘I almost had a heart attack seeing all of the people in the hall and the waiting room,’ Dr Goldman said between greeting well-wishers with a question about their health.

‘People ask me why do you go to a doctor who's 100?’ said Patti Levine, a fourth-generation patient of the doctor. ‘I tell them, because he's seen it all and he knows everything.’

The Blue Ash woman stood by a stroller holding her 10-month-old daughter, Madyson. ‘She's not his patient,’ Levine said, ‘yet.’ Fellow physicians also gave birthday greetings to Goldman.

‘He asked me to come work for him in 2007,’ said 85-year-old Dr Leo Wayne. ‘I told him I would not work for him. I'm too young.’

‘I would not dream of advising him to retire,’ Dr Wayne replied. ‘Dr Goldman is an excellent diagnostician. He knows his patients, including himself. He knows this patient is still up to the task.’

‘Don't feel anything different,’ Dr Goldman said of being aged 100. When Fred Goldman was literally a birthday boy, he was born on December 12, 1911, at his family's home.

‘My mother - a housewife - was from Poland. My father - a shopkeeper - was from Russia,’ he said, ‘and I was from both of them'.

'He's still going strong. They don't make men like Fred Goldman anymore'

Patti Heath

On the day the doctor was born, another native Cincinnatian, William Howard Taft, waddled about the White House as the 27th President of the U.S., Czar Nicholas II sat on the throne in Russia and George V - Queen Elizabeth II's grandfather - reigned as the King of England.

‘Hell, when I became a doctor in 1935,’ Dr Goldman said, ‘Freud was still seeing patients.’

In 1911, Madame Curie won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry. George Washington Carver was making 100 products from peanuts and Alexander Fleming was 17 years from discovering penicillin.

His schedule is set by his sole employee,
Patti Heath. ‘I came to work here when he was 91,’ she said. She 
thought she would be a short-timer. ‘Here I am nine years later. And 
he's still going strong.

‘The first year I worked for him, I collapsed on a beach for my vacation. He hiked the wilderness in Alaska and lived in a tent. They don't make men like Fred Goldman anymore.’

At the old General Hospital in Cincinnati, he was making his rounds one day when he met, wooed and eventually wed Esther Nelson, a red-haired farm-girl turned nurse from Amelia.

'I had never had a date with a woman before. This was around 1937. I asked her to go to dinner. She said, sure. I guess she was hungry'

Fred Goldman

‘She was tending to my patients. And, she had her own ideas about things, which I admired. The best thing was she became the mother of our three kids, the best gifts she ever gave me,’ he said.

One of his three sons, audiologist Tom Goldman, joined the tour. He beamed at those words. ‘I was a little, shy guy when I first dated Tom's mom,’ Dr Goldman added.

‘I had never had a date with a woman before. This was around 1937. I asked her to go to dinner. She said, sure. I guess she was hungry.’

They married the next year in Galveston, Texas, while he was teaching at the University of Texas.

‘We were married by a justice of the 
peace,’ he recalled. ‘We stood in line with 30 drunken Mexicans who had 
just been arrested. The justice of the peace pushed me aside and asked 
if I had $25. I did.’

Three years later, with America at war, the Goldmans returned to Cincinnati. He enlisted in the Navy.

‘They took me three months later and I got out of the Navy in 1946. I served in the Pacific,’ he said. ‘I was in a unit with six docs and 20 corpsmen. We were sent wherever they had a battle.’

Another party guest asked the centenarian tour guide for his secret to a long life. The doctor looked around the room. He spoke in a whisper.

'Haven't a clue why I've lived this long. Maybe it's because my office is a mess and I keep saying I'm going to clean it up. That keeps me going'

Fred Goldman

‘I have no secrets,’ he confided. ‘Haven't a clue why I've lived this long. Maybe it's because my office is a mess and I keep saying I'm going to clean it up. That keeps me going. That and it's in my genes.

‘My mother died at 91. So did one of my brothers. Another brother died in his 80s. So did my sister.’

He admitted to ‘some bumps in life.’ He survived major heart surgery and licked prostate cancer. ‘I had good doctors,’ he explained, ‘who took good care of me’. His wife of 60 years died in 1998.

‘When she died, I had to go on,’ he said, ‘I could not afford to feel sorry for myself. I had to be diverted by work.’ He has no plans of stopping now. ‘Work is life,’ he said. ‘I work on demand.

‘If there's not much demand, there's not much work. Fortunately, the demand exists. I feel I can still be helpful to people. And, I can still do the job. So, there's no sense to consider retirement.’
