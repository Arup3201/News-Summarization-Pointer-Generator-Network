The average British wedding now costs a bank-busting £22,000, a rise of £7,000 over a decade.

But one thrifty bride who spent just £5,000 on her dream wedding by making her own dress and finding bargains on eBay has said she loved economising... and now plans to make £500 re-selling bits of her big day online.

Seamstress Charlotte Denn-Cirrone, 31, from east London, is the founder of handmade children's wear brand What Mother Made, so was able to make her own gown from scratch for just £600 when she married Julian earlier this month.

The mother-of-two said the wedding was hard work, but that she wouldn't have had it any other way, even if she had the money.

'It was very hard work, but money was tight so we didn't really have another option,' Charlotte told MailOnline.

'Plus, I love shopping on eBay and trailing car boot sales and I'm really into making and mending - it's sort of a passion of mine - so even if we had had the money I wouldn't have done it differently.

'I brought my bridesmaid dresses on eBay 
and amended them myself as I am a seamstress. We went to try on dresses 
that we liked in stores and then I waited for them to come up on eBay.

'It's amazing, you're almost always guaranteed to see it eventually! It 
didn't matter what size they were because I could take them in. I saved 
about £350 by doing it that way.'

Charlotte is now planning on selling some of the items she made or bought on eBay to make back some of the £5,000 she spent on the wedding.

She said: 'The best thing about hand sourcing 
rather than hiring all your outfits and decorations is that you can sell
 them afterwards.

'eBay is the best place and If you advertise them as 
wedding items you can show your wedding images with all your items 
looking fabulous!'

Although Charlotte was considering selling her homemade wedding dress online, she has become too attached to it and doesn't want to see it go.

'I reckon we'll make about £500 from selling napkins and tablecloths on eBay,' she said.

The bridesmaids dresses were all bought on eBay, having been seen in Monsoon, and then Charlotte tailored them to size

Charlotte made her own wedding dress for just £600, and guests were given disposable cameras to take pictures of the big day

Charlotte, who has two children, Maddie, six, and nine-month-old Arlo, said eBay was all about 'seeing the potential' in something.

Her advice for a bride planning a thrifty wedding is to 'know your budget and stick to it'. She added: 'It's so easy to just overspend and as 
there is so much to buy it all adds up.

'Also try to find listings on 
eBay that end during the week, there tend to be fewer bidders going for 
the same thing.

'Remember that it's just one day and that it'll be lovely... especially if you don't spend too much! Ours was just perfect.

'I kept telling everyone how small our budget was! I was really proud actually that I had achieved such a high end look on such a low budget.

'I love miss matching items to create the look we were after so finding random beautiful things on eBay was perfect for our budget.'

eBay spokesman Steven Heywood said: 'We 
all attend a multitude of weddings and it's always the very personal 
ones that stick in our memory and are the most fun.

'With the cost of 
weddings continually rising it’s more important than ever that we look 
to make the most of our budgets and eBay provides the perfect 
platform for all your wedding inspiration and needs'.

Charlotte and Julian planned the whole day for under £5,000

Total cost: £4,980

Charlotte's advice to marrying on a budget is to use eBay, make as much as you can yourself and source items from friends

2013 now sees the average wedding cost a budget busting £22,000 - rising a massive £7,000 over the last decade. But your perfect day doesn't have to cost the earth.

eBay.co.uk teamed up with wedding planning expert George Watts, The Wedding Fairy, to show you how to create your bespoke dream day without breaking the bank. The Wedding Fairy said: 'The very best weddings are always those soaked in personality and character, so by choosing to do it DIY style - you are already half way there, eBay.co.uk has a wealth of ideas and items to inspire and help you sprinkle a little magic on your dream day'. 

Here are George's tips:

George Watts the Wedding Fairy says the best weddings are the most personal ones, whatever the cost

1) Glue and glitter guns at the readyAdd a personal touch to those wedding invites by designing and producing them yourselves. eBay has thousands of design options, from the fun to the full-on artistic – so get creative! 2) Something for the young at heart What about a few traditional fete stalls to keep the little ones and young at heart entertained during pre-dinner drinks and is great conversation starter. This option is very easy to organise and doesn’t have to cost a fortune. eBay has 'coconut shies' listed to really get the party started!   3) Big day bake offWhy have only one cake when you can invite all your guests to construct a sculpture of the sweet treats variety to bring along to the wedding. This little competition is great fun on the day itself and kind to your budget too. Grab a mix of totally gorgeous shabby chic cake stands and accessories from eBay to create a stunning table centre-piece for your celebrations.4) Tap into your local communityUtilise your own talents as well as all the individual skills of your community. Someone will know someone who does hair, or works as a DJ on the weekends, is a keen amateur photographer or indeed has a lovely set of wheels they can loan you for the celebrations. 5) Flower powerFlower farms are a fresh alternative to the traditional florist and are popping up all over the UK, giving couples the chance to step into a field of foliage to select a fresh bouquet of buds straight from the ground. Artificial flowers are also really hot right now and perfect for prepping in advance of the wedding. eBay offers so many creative options for every budget, from dramatic pre-designed floral displays through to individual buds to literally build your own.
