A father who took his two young sons to McDonald's was shocked to find a group of pigeons eating off the indoor tables as staff allegedly stood by and did nothing.

Josh Fry Snr, from Davoren Park north of Adelaide, visited the fast food outlet at Rundle Mall with his sons Josh, eight, and Charlie, six, on Saturday.

But when the family saw six pigeons they were turned off ordering food, so instead Mr Fry Snr, 28, took footage on his phone which he then posted to Facebook.

'We were going to go in for an ice cream but once we saw that, my two sons said they didn't want to go in there because they saw the birds,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'It was disgusting and I was in shock.'

Mr Fry Snr said he was appalled that the McDonald's employees had not noticed, and that the pigeons were still in there when he walked back past the restaurant 20 minutes later.

'It wasn't very busy, only maybe five or six people in line, and no staff to be seen,' he said.

He added that the rubbish was still on the table where the pigeons had been eating, and the birds had moved onto another empty table with leftovers.

The camera then pans to show another pigeon on the ground and a line of customers waiting at the counter.

Mr Fry then focusses the video on the McDonald's signage out the front of the restaurant.

'I just posted a video because they wouldn't have done anything,' he said.

'I did complain to McDonald's but I still haven't heard anything.'

A McDonald's spokesman said: McDonald’s has high standards when it comes to cleanliness - our crew and managers clean dining areas at least every 20 minutes. 

'The restaurant has also implemented a number of deterrents, including the installation of an air-curtain.'
