Anguish: Claire Hedley, 34, with her youngest 
son Caleb. She lost her eight-year-old Ian after he was swept away by 
the River Wear while out playing

An anguished mother has denounced the River Wear as cursed after it claimed the lives of both her young son and her best friend.

Claire Hedley, from Sunnybrow, County Durham, was speaking for the first time after her son Ian Bell was swept into the river in April.

She had given birth prematurely to Ian's younger brother Caleb just weeks before the eight-year-old went missing near the river while playing with friends.

It was only nine days later, after a major search, that the youngster's body was found.

Miss Hedley, 34, revealed yesterday that, in a cruel twist of fate's knife, her young son was the second person she had lost to the 'cursed river'.

Her best friend Cameron Hawkins was also swept away by the River Wear's deadly currents six years ago.

The landscape gardener, who was just 27 at the time, had been clambering on a rocky outcrop when a branch snapped. He slipped and hit his head on rocks before falling into the water.

Four hours later a police marine unit recovered his body.

Miss Hedley, who is a full-time mother, said: 'He was mine and (my partner) Ian’s best friend and we lost him in that river.

'That river is cursed.

'Ian (my son) was beautiful, he was a happy-go-lucky boy. He was just brilliant, really polite and never disrespectful.

'I am going to miss Ian the whole world over.'

Miss Hedley and her partner Ian Bell, 33, had already endured a difficult month before losing their son in April.

Only four weeks earlier, on Monday March 26, Miss Hedley had given birth to Caleb 10 weeks before his due date, meaning he mad to by taken straight from his mother to a special baby care unit.

Weighing a mere 2lbs 10oz, Caleb needed round-the-clock care from medics to help him breathe properly. He was in the University Hospital of North Durham when his older brother went missing.

Ian had been out playing with friends near the Brown Trout pub in Sunnybrow on Friday April 27, where the nearby River Wear was swollen after heavy rainfall.

In a cruel replay of the circumstances in which Mr Hawkins died, Ian plunged into the river after a tree branch he was swinging on snapped.

It took authorities over a week to find the youngster's body under Page Bank Bridge, just three miles from the spot where he had fallen in.

Miss Hedley, who is also mother to 
Benjamin, 12, and Kirsty, 15, spoke of the 'awful' days that followed 
the family's discovery of their son's death.

'I
had a little boy upstairs poorly and a little boy downstairs dead,' she
said. 'I wanted to bring Ian home and get him warm, but I couldn’t.

'Caleb has been a comfort, but he wasn’t at first, I couldn’t bond with him. I felt awful inside because I thought I have lost one boy and gained another boy.

'It didn’t feel right. But Caleb is my life now, he’s just beautiful. He is what I put my time into, either that or I am down at the river or the graveyard.

'I hope nobody else in their entire lives has to go through this.'

Miss Hedley also today raised questions over why it took so long to find Ian. Her son's body was eventually discovered by a diver acting under police direction.

'If anything like this ever happened again, and I put my hand on my heart and hope it never does, I hope the police have learnt some lessons,' she said.

'Everybody in the community had to help look for Ian. My boy was missing in that river for nine days and it was a member of the community who found him.

'I think the police could have tried a lot harder to find him. My partner Ian got a search team together that day and everything.

'If it wasn’t for the public, I don’t believe my boy would have been found.'

County Durham and Darlington coroner Andrew Tweddle has opened and adjourned an inquest into Ian’s death.
