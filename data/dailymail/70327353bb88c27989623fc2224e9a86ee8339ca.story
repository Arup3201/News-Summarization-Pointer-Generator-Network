Controversy raged after Sunday night's X Factor after Rylan Clark was dramatically saved and contestant Carolynne Poole became the first contestant to be sent home despite a stunning performance in the sing-off.

The decision followed endless dithering by judge Louise Walsh who initially said he wanted to save Carolynne, and then controversially changed his mind to take the decision to deadlock.

Rylan receive the most votes from the public to stay in the competition and after hearing that his act was the first to be booted off the show, and clearly disgusted with Louis, head judge Gary Barlow stormed off the stage.

Fuming: Gary leaves the stage as soon as the decision is revealed, prompting gasps from the audience

X Factor

Without
waiting to hear what his act Carolynne had to say, the Take That singer
got up from his seat and left the arena, after criticising the Essex 
wannabe on Saturday night for his poor performance.

While Nicole Scherzinger and Gary both predictably voted to save their own acts, Tulisa Contostavlos voted for country singer Carolynne to stay in the competition.

But it was down to Louis Walsh to give the final vote and have his say on their fates in the competition.

Louis, whose group acts all went through to next week, took his time in making his decision before initially telling Dermot O'Leary that he wanted to save Carolynne.

she was dropped from the competition thanks to the public vote

When asked to state clearly who it was that he wanted to send home, Louis then dramatically changed his mind and told the host that he wanted to instead take the decision to deadlock, which caused a huge reaction in the audience and the other judges sitting beside him.

'I'm sorry, I'm changing my mind, I want to take it to deadlock,' he told Dermot.

Carolynne, who thought that she had been saved by the judges then faced uncertainty as the results of the viewers votes were read out.

Emotional: Rylan leaves the stage after an emotional showdown and harsh criticism form Gary

While the 32-year-old singer, who got through to Judges' House last year, was magnanimous in defeat, her mentor wasn't as he angrily glared at Louis before storming out of the auditorium.

Speaking backstage, Gary called the outcome an 'absolute joke', telling his act that 'two years running you've lost out to joke acts', a sentiment pointing to the fact that she narrowly missed getting to the live rounds last year when she originally applied for the show.

Rylan's high-octane performance of Spandau Ballet's Gold split the critics on Saturday, promoting Gary to react strongly:

'I wanted to have some fun and I really was having fun until you started singing tonight. I was embarrassed to be sat here.'

While the other judges were kinder to the wannabe star, they were all agreed that Carolynne's rendition of Nicki Minaj's Starships was a great performance.

Saved: Nicole supports her act after a tension-filled night

Earlier in the evening, all 13 acts took to the stage for their first group performance, singing Emeli Sande's Read All About It.

In recent years the group performance has been mimed, but this year all of the acts had the opportunity to sing live.

Urban: Charlie Rundle and Simoen Dixon of MK1 were criticised for their vocals last night

Having to work together for the first time, all of the contestants got the chance to sing part of the song and showcase their individual talents.

After the performance, the acts left the stage and headed backstage to wait for the last of the votes to come in.

Leona Lewis, who became a global megastar after winning the talent contest in 2006, also took to the stage during the evening to perform her new single, Trouble, before the results were announced.

Saved: Jade and Jahmene impressed during their first live performance and were saved through to next week

Celebrations: Union J were criticised after Louis' song choice for them but were ecstatic to learn they had gotten through

Girl power: Tulisa jumped for joy when she realised all of her female acts were safe for at least another week

Stand out performance: Teenager Ella Henderson wowed the audience and the judges with her rendition of Take That's Rule The World

She stunned in a purple gown as she made a return to the show which made her famous.

And Ne-Yo also performed for the lively crowd following his performance earlier in the day at the BBC Radio 1 Teen Awards.

It was a good night for chimney sweep Kye Sones, who impressed all of the judges, while one of the big stand out acts came in the form of 16-year-old Ella Henderson, who wowed with her rendition of Take That's Rule The World.

Taking their places: Gary Barlow, Nicole Scherzinger, Tulisa Contostavlos and Louis Walsh were all friendly at the start of the night before the controversy

Singing his heart out: Kye Sones was one of the favourites following his performance during the first live show

Star act: Former X Factor winner Leona Lewis made her return to the show on Sunday night dressed in a flamboyant purple gown to sing her new track, Trouble

She's back: Leona chatted to Dermot as she made her comeback showing the new contestants how it's done

Opening the show: At the start of the live programme all of the acts sang together for the group song - and sang it live for the first time compared to other years

Her vocals even led to Gary Barlow commenting straight afterwards: 'I've got to be honest. there's nothing I hate more than someone singing my song ten million times better than me.'

She has now become favourite to win the competition, alongside shy singer Jahmene Douglas, who also managed to wow after battling his shyness.

James Arthur was also hailed during the night, as was Lucy Spraggan.

But boy band Union J were given some constructive crticism after their mentor Louis Walsh was slated for their Queen song choice.

Even Louis admitted they;d have to work harder next week to show them at their full potential.
