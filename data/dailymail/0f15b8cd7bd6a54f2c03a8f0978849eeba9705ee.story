Tottenham have crashed out of the Europa League after an agonising 2-0 defeat in Florence.

Spurs should have had a half-time lead but Roberto Soldado spurned a glorious chance when through on goal and that was the turning point as Mario Gomez and Mohamed Salah struck for Fiorentina to send Mauricio Pochettino's side out. 

Spurs now have to quickly turn their attention to Sunday, to prepare for the Capital One Cup final against Chelsea at Wembley.

Host commentator

Thanks for joining me for the action in Florence this evening. Spurs will certainly need to re-group ahead of facing Chelsea in the Capital One Cup final on Sunday

Heartache for Spurs, they are out! Fiorentina have won and are through to the Europa League last 16.

22-year-old Salah has done his parent club Chelsea a real favour tonight. The winger, on loan in Florence, has been exceptional. I wonder if Blues boss Jose Mourinho has been watching...

Tottenham keep losing possession as the lump the ball forward. It's all very desperate now.

Fiorentina's side are a wall of purple as Tottenham continue to fail at breaking their stubborn resistance.

Andros Townsend whips in a freekick and Soldado's looping header just cruves over the bar.

Here is the picture Spurs fans won't want to see- Salah doubling Fiorentina's lead.

Eriksen lets fire from long range but Neto makes a smart save to concede a corner

Joaquin heads off for club legend Pasqual as the hosts try to run down the clock

The Florence side are already time wasting by holding up the ball in the Tottenham corner as Spurs struggle to obtain possession. Time is running out.

It's all Spurs at the moment but the attacking play is very disjointed.

Harry Kane has the ball in the back of the net but Soldado is offside before his cutback. Tottenham still require two goals.

Andros Townsend wins a freekick just on the edge of the area but Eriksen once again hits the wall.

Vertonghen trudges off to be replaced by Walker

Salah is booked for his exuberant celebration having ripped off his top during his sprint to the crowd

Spurs shoot themselves in the foot. An innocuous ball isn't dealt with by Tottenham and a one-two between Salah and Gomez puts the Egyptian through on goal. He finishes past Lloris and leaps over the advertising hoardings to celebrate. Spurs on the brink?

It's that man again - Badelj is free 20 yards out but Fiorentina waste another decent chance after his blazes well over the bar. 

Micah Richards has put in a fine performance for the Serie A side. Here's some of his latest acrobatics! 

Here we go, here come the cavalry. Harry Kane and Andros Townsend come on for Spurs. Chadli and Bentaleb make way.

Salah weaves his way through the Spurs defence and finds himself in front of Lloris but his weak shot is hit straight at the French stopper. Unbelievable chance to double the lead.

Time for a change? Spurs are getting increasingly frustrated as Bentaleb attempts an audacious cross field pass which goes out for a Fiorentina goalkick!

Gonzalo Rodriguez on, Basanta off after the defender pulls up whilst making a clearance. 

Mario Gomez runs clear after a horror moment from Fazio. The centre back gives the ball away to Badelj, who plays in the former Bayern Munich striker to sprint through and slot past Lloris.

Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino is becoming increasingly animated on the touchline, especially after a few decisions have gone against his side

Badelj is in the thick of the action. Salah steals the ball in the Spurs penalty area and cuts it back for Badelj but his effort from the middle of the box is straight at Lloris

Ben Davies is booked for a robust tackle on Badelj. Slightly harsh as seemed 50/50.

Chadli bursts down the left wing but his cross is too close to Neto.

Massive 45 mins for Spurs who begin the second-half.

So whilst free-scoring Harry Kane is on the bench and Soldado has spurned a glorious chance, Pochettino's other striker Emmanuel Adebayor has posted on Instagram a picture of him kicking back drinking from a coconut.

A sustained period of pressure from Spurs sees multiple crosses into the Fiorentina box. Nobody can latch onto a cross and it stays 0-0 at the break. That gives gives Spurs 45 minutes to find a desperately needed away goal to progress.

A ball over the top sees Salah race through once again but his effort his flashed well over the Tottenham bar. 

Here is the moment Soldado should have scored for Spurs. Ouch!

Mario Gomez out of nothing is clear by the Tottenham touchline, he cuts back inside but his shot is well blocked by Fazio. It ricochets off Fazio's arm but a penalty would have been extremely harsh.

Free-kick for Spurs....and specialist Eriksen smacks it into the wall. Disappointing for the visitors but it's all hands to the pump for Fiorentina as the pressure continues to build on their goal.

Since Soldado's shocker Tottenham have been well on top. It seems the hosts are giving Spurs far too much respect and Pochettino's side are struggling to break down two banks of defence.

Sportsmail's Riath Al-Samarrai, who is at the Stadio Artemio Franchi, sums it up well...

Soldado is played straight through on goal as the Fiorentina back-line is far too high. Soldado is joined clear with Chadli but the Spaniard's tame pass fails to find Chadli and Neto is able to intercept and gather the ball. That's a crucial waste from Soldado, but how costly will it prove?

So far so good for Spurs. They've managed to get into the game and keep Salah relatively quiet. However Pochettino doesn't seem too thrilled on the touchline...

Former Liverpool midfielder Alberto Aquilani enters the fray as Fernandez picks up a muscle injury

Almost immediately after Chiriches swings in a delightful ball from wide right which Savic has to clear with a last-ditch header. Very promising spell for Spurs.

Spurs win a corner and from the clearance Stambouli unleashes from 20 yards but his effort is well blocked by Joaquin.

Nacer Chadli loses possession wide on the left and a swift counter attack started by Micah Richard sees Mario Gomez in on goal but he fails to find his feet and Ben Davies just about manages to cover the danger and force a goal kick. The Italians are rapid on the break.

Spurs really need to close down Salah. The winger finds volumes of space on the edge of Tottenham's area and is narrowly called back for offside. Spurs were in trouble there

Well well, Spurs have a penalty shout! Stefan Savic (a former Manchester City defender) goes to ground and brings down Eriksen in the box. Minimal if any contact with thew ball but referee Hüseyin Göçek waves away some weak appeals.

Former Roma forward Erik Lamela volleys at goal from outside the box but it's comfortably saved by Murara Neto

Salah is already imposing himself on the game with his pace. Running down the left he wins a corner for the hosts but Lloris does well to punch clear

As I mentioned, talisman striker Harry Kane is on the bench for Spurs tonight.

The Serie A side have the first chance. Chelsea loanee Mohamed Salah does well on the left to set up Badelj but his 20 year strike goes wide of Lloris' post.

Their is a raucous atmosphere at the Stadio Artemio Franchi and both sides have begun tentatively. Focus will be needed tonight.

Kick-off has started another historic European night for Tottenham...

A strong Spurs line-up is out on the pitch. Just a reminder Pochettino's side must score after Fiorentina's away goal at White Hart Lane last week.

The Tottenham squad has been out on the Stadio Artemio Franchi pitch for a quick warm up. They'll play in front of 2,200 Spurs fans who have sold out their allocation.

Harry Kane is supposedly rested for the Capital One Cup final against Chelsea on Sunday. But will Spurs need him later to rescue their European dream?

Fiorentina substitutes: Rodriguez, Aquilani, Pasqual, Lezzerini, Babacar, Tomovic, Ilicic

Tottenham substitutes: Walker, Rose, Paulinho, Vorm, Townsend, Kane, Mason

Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino appears in high spirits ahead of kick-off

Here are the line-ups out in Italy. The big news is Harry Kane starts on the bench for Spurs.

Fiorentina (4-3-3): Murara Neto; Richards, Basanta, Savic, Alonso;  Fernandez, Pizarro, Badelj; Joaquin, Gomez, Salah

Tottenham (4-4-1-1): Lloris; Chiriches, Fazio, Vertonghen, Davies; Stambouli; Bentaleb,  Lamela, Chadli; Eriksen; Soldado
