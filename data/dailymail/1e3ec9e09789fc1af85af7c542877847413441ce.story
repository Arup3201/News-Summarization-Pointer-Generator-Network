Former America’s Top Model winner Whitney Thompson is a champion of fuller figured woman.

The plus sized model has previously set up a dating website for larger ladies and even posed naked to promote awareness of eating disorders and accepting your body shape whatever your size.

Now the stunning 26-year-old has been chosen to front the new Sculptresse lingerie collection by Panache.

With her long platinum locks gently curled and hanging loose over her shoulders, the ANTM season 10 winner shows of her voluptuous curves in the bright, feminine range of bra and knicker sets.

With dramatic lighting and a minimalist set it is easy to see why Florida born beauty was chosen for the campaign. 

The vibrant coloured lingerie is specifically designed to comfortably support to 36-46' backs and D-J cups. 

Speaking of her collaboration with Sculptresse, Whitney says: ‘As a curvy girl, I have always struggled with finding lingerie that offers the support I need, and the style that I want, which is why I’m so thrilled to have found the Sculptresse collection by Panache!

‘Panache have always delivered stylish choices, but you can really tell that they understand the fit. I don’t care how cute a bra is if it doesn’t fit me properly! Each piece in the collection is a comfortable fit with great support, and they’re beautiful.

‘I feel feminine and sexy when I wear the pieces, which is important for me and other curvy women. It’s about time we had a collection like this for the real woman.’

Sculptresse by Panache starts from a D cup and goes up to a J cup, back sizes start from a 36 and goes up to a 46.

Prices range from £14.50 for briefs and £33 for a bra.

The colourful May set features a print of tiny roses. All the bras in the Sculptresse collection are designed to support curvier women
