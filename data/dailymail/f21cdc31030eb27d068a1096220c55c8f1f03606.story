Britain's immigration system is like a 'never-ending game of snakes and ladders', Theresa May claimed today as she vowed to end the culture of endless appeals.

The Home Secretary used a speech at the Tory party conference to announce that foreign criminals, terrorists and illegal immigrants will be kicked out of Britain before they get the chance to claim their human rights are being breached.

She also promised to slash the number of grounds on which migrants can lodge an appeal from the current 17 to just four after the fiasco of the deportation of Abu Qatada, who finally returned home to Jordan earlier this year after a 12-year legal battle.

Big changes: Home secretary Theresa May plans a major shake-up of the immigration laws in Britain

Problems: Mrs May said the immigration system is like a never-ending game of snakes and ladders with almost 70,000 appeals heard every year

Home Office officials expect the 
crackdown to more than halve the astonishing 68,000 cases lodged against
the Government every year.

‘I am clear that the law must be on the side of people who respect the law, not those who break it,’ Mrs May said.

Her
move came as David Cameron gave the strongest signal yet that the 
Tories are ready to quit the meddling European Court of Human Rights. 

The
Prime Minister said he would do ‘whatever it takes’ to ensure Britain 
can throw out people who pose a threat to the country and have no right 
to be here.

The court’s
interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is 
enshrined in British law in the Human Rights Act, has been condemned by 
many Conservative MPs.

Asked if the party is considering complete withdrawal, the Prime Minister said: ‘It may be that that is where we end up.’

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling told the Conservative Party conference in Manchester today that the court has become a ‘big international frustration’.

A Tory government would ‘scrap Labour’s Human Rights Act and make sure that with legal rights go legal responsibilities’.

Ministers have tried for years to take a
hard line against preachers of hate, foreign criminals and illegal 
immigrants.

But they can drag out the appeal process for years – usually
by citing the Human Rights Act and the European Convention on Human 
Rights.

Theresa May's announcement comes after David Cameron, pictured at the Tory conference yesterday, gave the strongest signal yet that the Tories are ready to quit the European Court of Human Rights

The ECHR has been invoked by scores of people fighting deportation from Britain. They argue its provisions mean they are entitled to various rights, including the right to a family life. As soon as an appeal is lodged, deportation proceedings are halted.

In a Daily Mail interview, Mrs May said public trust was being undermined – and tens of millions of pounds squandered – by migrants and their lawyers playing the system.

The number of grounds that a migrant can appeal on will be cut from 17 to four after it took a 12-year legal battle to deport Abu Qatada

In future, officials will be told to throw people out of the country as soon as their case has been decided by the Government – a system which is already in place in France. They can still appeal, but only from their homeland.

The only exception would be in cases where there is a ‘risk of serious irreversible harm’, such as torture or execution.

Migrants who claim to have a right to a ‘family life’ under article 8 of the Human Rights – the biggest frustration to the public – can still be thrown out.

Tory backbenchers will hope the tough stance, which will be unveiled in Mrs May’s speech to the conference today, will help to win back voters who have defected to Ukip.

Mrs May said: ‘The Abu Qatada case proved that we need a dramatic change in our human rights law. We’re going to cut the number of appeal rights, extend cases where we deport first and hear the appeal later, and use primary legislation to make sure judges interpret the “right to a family life” properly.’

Mrs May also wants to end the farce of migrants being able to build up ‘rights’ to stay in Britain by stringing out an appeal for as long as possible. The longer a person can remain in the UK - even if they are facing removal - the easier it is to claim they have established a ‘family life’.

A new Immigration Bill will be introduced when Parliament returns. The 17 existing rights of appeal will be cut to just four. A right of appeal will only exist where the decision is complex and fact-specific.

The Tories say it will reduce the number of appeals by nearly 60 per cent, leading to an estimated net saving of £219million over ten years.

Tough: The Home Secretary accused the Lib Dems of blocking plans for an immigration bond

In her speech to the Tory party conference in Manchester today, Mrs May said: 'The Government will soon publish the Immigration Bill, which will make it easier to get rid of people with no right to be here.

'First, we are going to cut the number of appeal rights. At the moment the system is like a never-ending game of snakes and ladders with almost 70,000 appeals heard every year.

'The winners - foreign criminals and immigration lawyers, while the losers are the victims of these crimes and the public.

'So we're going to cut the number of appeal rights from 17 to four and in doing so cut the total number of appeals by more than half.

'Last year human rights were cited in almost 10,000 immigration appeal cases so the second thing we will do is extend the number of non-suspensive appeals.

'That means that where there is no risk of serious and irreversible harm we should deport foreign criminals first and hear their appeals later.'

Stepping out: Theresa May wore shiny patent brogues with jewelled heels to deliver her speech in the main hall on the second day of the Conservative Party

Theresa May was dressed for business from head-to-toe as she delivered her speech to Conservative delegates in Manchester.

Ditching a more obvious power dressing stiletto for a pair of shiny patent brogues the Home Secretary proved she is more than a dress as she promised to kick out illegal immigrants, at the same time as impressing any fashion watchers.

Flats are back this season. And 56-year-old Theresa proved a sensible shoe doesn’t need to make you look like an old man by choosing a dressy pair from Russell & Bromley.

The always stylish politician loves to add interest to a business outfit with a statement shoe.

Pledge: Mrs May said new immigration laws will make it easier to get rid of people with no right to be here

Ever since she stepped out in a pair of leopard-print kitten heels at the Tory party conference in 2002 her feet have been a focus for fashionistas.

She has revealed that she uses her shoes as an ‘icebreaker’ in important talks, saying: ‘I have no regrets (about being famous for my shoes). The good thing is that they are often an icebreaker.’

Other bold choices of her footwear have included animal-print kitten heels, leopard-print wellies, turquoise sandals, bejellewed heels, striped courts and ruby-red flats.

The  shiny leather and smattering of bling on Monday’s shoes gave these ladylike lace-ups a stylish edge.

The tartan suit, too, is bang on trend, as seen on the catwalks of Chanel and model of the moment Cara Delevingne.
