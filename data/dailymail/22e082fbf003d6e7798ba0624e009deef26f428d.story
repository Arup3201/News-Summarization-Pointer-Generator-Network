Manchester City have no intention of selling striker Alvaro Negredo.

Sportsmail understands the Spaniard is not for sale despite increasing speculation linking him with Atletico Madrid.

The club has not received a bid from or had any contact with the Spanish champions over a potential £20million move, as has been reported.

Wanted man: Manchester City intend to keep striker Alvaro Negredo at the Etihad next season

Inconsistent: Negredo scored 23 goals last season but he did not net after January

Such overtures would not be welcomed and, in any case, City now have a higher valuation of the 28-year-old than the reported figure, which equals the amount they paid Sevilla for him last summer.

Negredo made an immediate impact at the Etihad Stadium last season and he finished the campaign with 23 goals in all competitions.

The last of those strikes, however, came in January as the player lost form in the second half of the season after suffering a shoulder injury.

That slump cost him a place in the Spain squad for the World Cup in Brazil.

Now it has been claimed that he is unsettled and is being lined up as a potential replacement at Atletico for Diego Costa, who is expected to join Chelsea.

Negredo does hail from the Spanish capital and began his career with Real Madrid.

But City want to retain his services among a striking quartet that also includes Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic.

Interest: Atletico Madrid are believed to want to sign Negredo but City value him at more than £20m

Keen: City manager Manuel Pellegrini is keen on keeping the Spain striker at the Etihad next season
