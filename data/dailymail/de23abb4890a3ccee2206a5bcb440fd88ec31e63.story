Labour MP John Healey unearthed the costs of calling government departments

Millions of people are being ripped off by government premium rate phone lines, it was claimed today.

The Department for Transport alone raised £2.5million over two years from calls branded a ‘telephone tax’.

Labour MP John Healey warned many of the premium-rate numbers were imposed on the ‘sick, elderly and vulnerable usually on fixed, low incomes’.

Almost two thirds of the government’s 371 lines called by the public are high cost 0844 and 0845 numbers or premium (09) numbers. The numbers cost up to 41p per minute to call.

Mr Healey has compiled a dossier of the huge costs charged by ministries to discuss benefits, travel queries and business advice.

The National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee should now investigate the use of the numbers and the impact on the public, Mr Healey said.

‘We make millions of calls every year to government departments and agencies,’ he added.

‘People have no choice but to make these calls – to get information and help, change details, make claims – but they are being charged rip-off rates to do so.

‘Members of the public are subsidising the government’s phone bills to the tune of millions of pounds and phone companies are making a fortune.

‘Living costs are high enough already without the government hiking up phone bills through this telephone tax.’

The Department for Transport raised £2.5million revenue from 2010 to 2013, for lines operated by the DVLA for motor trade businesses.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pocketed £ 10,000 in revenue from lines operated by the Rural Payments Agency. Other departments receive benefits in kind from phone companies.

For example, HM Revenue and Customs receives £4.7million worth of free additional services from Cable & Wireless.

The Department for Work and Pensions, which has 139 high cost lines, has had the cost of outbound calls reduced by BT.

Helplines for the government’s new benefits – Personal Independence Payment and Universal Credit – will also be 0845 numbers.

Mr Healey compiled details of 16 government departments and their agencies through parliamentary questions.

He found that 61% were high cost and 39% free or geographic rate.

The Home Office has 23 phone lines of which 22 are high cost, while 139 of 172 lines at DWP charge extra to call.

Other departments also use high costs lines including Defra which has 24, Department for Business which has 19 and Transport eight.

A DWP spokesman said: 'DWP does not earn any revenue from 0845 numbers. All claimants who need to use an 0845 number can do so for free from their local Jobcentre or can request a call back from an adviser.'
