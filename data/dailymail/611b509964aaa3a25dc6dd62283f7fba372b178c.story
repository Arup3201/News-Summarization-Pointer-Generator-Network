Victim: Joseph Griffiths was stabbed to death by a burglar

This is the hardworking grandfather who was stabbed to death by a burglar as he defended his £1million home.

Joseph Griffiths, 73, was knifed at least seven times after he went downstairs to investigate a noise.

His wife Judith, 72, who is recovering from a hip operation, woke to hear shouts and screams.

She went downstairs and found her husband lying in a pool of blood. Paramedics were called but they were unable to save Mr Griffiths. The murder took place on Saturday at around 6am. Yesterday, as police continued their hunt for the killer, friends and neighbours paid tribute to a ‘kind-hearted man’ who had worked hard all his life to provide for his family.

One friend said his family are ‘devastated and raw, but trying to carry on as normal’.

Neighbour Kieran Donaghey, 23, said: ‘He was a kind man who was devoted to his wife.

‘He was only trying to protect his wife and he has ended up dead. It’s so very sad.’

Mr Griffiths set up his own car repair business near his home in Fulham, West London, in 1994. He continued to work there past retirement age, and employed one of his two sons, Mark, 51, along with grown-up grandchildren.

Customer William Broome said: ‘He was a lovely man. He took a real interest in his customers and would remember your job and what you did, which is rare in this day and age.’

Neighbours said they were frightened at the number of burglaries in the Sands End district of Fulham lately. There have been 67 break-ins in the area in the past 12 months. Almudena Mura, 38, who lives several houses from Mr Griffiths’s home, was burgled last December.

‘It is terrible what has happened and it’s scary, especially having had someone break in to my own home.

‘Something woke me in the middle of 
the night and I thought it might be my child. But when I went to check, 
there was a mess everywhere and I realised I’d been burgled.

‘It’s lucky that I was asleep when 
they came or who knows what could have happened.’ Another neighbour, who
 did not want to be named, said: ‘I’ve been burgled, so has my 
neighbour. It’s definitely worrying.’

Tributes: Flowers have been left outside Mr Griffiths' home

Detective Superintendent Nick 
Sedgemore tried to reassure residents yesterday, telling them their area
 was not a burglary hotspot.

He said: ‘There is not a high volume of burglaries in the ward.’

Last month Jean Farrer, 77, was found dead after reports of a disturbance at her home in Brentford, West London.

A man has been charged with  her murder.
