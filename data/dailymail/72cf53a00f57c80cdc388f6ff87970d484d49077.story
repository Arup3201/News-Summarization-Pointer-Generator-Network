Russian President Vladimir Putin looked bemused today as he was confronted by a group of topless female protestors in Germany.

The activists, who strip off to highlight a range of issues, including women's rights, press freedom and domestic violence were dragged kicking and screaming from the premises by security guards

As one women tried to push through to Putin she was blocked by his aides - her back was painted with an obscene word directed against the Russian president.

The members of the women's rights 
group Femen, which has staged protests against Russia's detention of the
feminist punk band Pussy Riot around Europe, appeared as he visited a trade fair in 
Hanover with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

They stripped off to the waist and 
shouted slogans calling the Russian leader a 'dictator' before being 
covered up and bundled away by security men.

But a smiling Putin shrugged off the protest and said 'As for the action, I liked it.'

'You should be grateful to the girls, they are helping you make the fair more popular.'

But Merkel was not amused. 'Whether 
one has to resort to such an emergency measure in Germany and can't say 
one's piece some other way, I have my doubts,' she said.

But it seems that the Kremlin were not so impressed by the demonstration as Putin.

'This is ordinary hooliganism and 
unfortunately it happens all over the world, in any city. One needs to 
punish (them),' said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.

The Russian leader's arrival at the 
trade fair on Sunday also drew protesters, some of whom were dressed in 
striped prison uniforms. 'Stop political terror,' read one banner.

Merkel
told Putin in a speech at the fair on Sunday that Russia needed 'an 
active civil society' including freedom for non-governmental 
organisations, after a wave of controversial state inspections of 
foreign-funded NGOs in Russia.

The
chancellor had promised to raise what she called 'controversial 
subjects' with Putin, after coming under pressure to voice Berlin's 
unease over the crackdown on NGOs, Moscow's support of the Syrian 
government and its criticism of the German-orchestrated financial 
bailout of Cyprus.

Femen was founded in Kiev in 2008 to protest against Ukraine's booming sex industry. At their first demonstration members appeared clothed carrying banners reading 'Ukraine is not a brothel!'.

But it was the demonstrations in favor of the jailed Russia punk group Pussy Riot in August last year that brought the group to the attention of the worldwide media.

The organisation has since gone from strength to strength with 150,000 members worldwide and branches across Europe and even in highly conservative countries such as Egypt.

As part of the Pussy Riot protests, the Brazilian Femen branch staged a demonstration outside the Russian embassy in Sao Paulo.

Three women were arrested including two members of Femen and another who joined in the protest spontaneously.

During the Olympic protest, demonstrators organised an 'islamic marathon' to 
demonstrate against 'islamic regimes' they say are being supported by 
the IOC.

In September last year Military Police in Rio de Janiero arrested two women protesting topless on the Esplanade of Ministries during the country's Independence Day parades.

At the time Femen Brazil founding member Sara Winter criticised the arrests arguing that while Brazil's hugely popular carnivals exploit female nudity the country does not tolerate it during a political protest.

In another incident Ms Winter attempted to invade the stage during a performance by pop star Gretchen but was held back by security guards.

At the end of the show she managed to get onstage where she was pictured holding a sign with the phrase: 'Every three minutes, a woman is beaten in Brazil.'

Protest: Topless activists from a Ukrainian 
women's rights group staged a second attack on the Euro 2012 trophy by 
grabbing it while it was on public display

During last year's Olympic games four topless Femen activists were arrested after a protest in central London after accusing the Olympics' organisers of having supported 'bloody' Islamist regimes.

Some of the women had slogans marked on their bare chests. At least one carried the message: 'No Sharia'.

Three months earlier Femen activists managed to snatch football's European Championship trophy on two occasions during the tournament in the Ukraine.

They grabbed the cup in May while it was on display in a central square in Dnipropetrovsk, south-east Ukraine.

One activist took off her top to reveal an offensive slogan before picking up the trophy.

As security guards moved in on her, another activist, standing next to the cup, stripped off to the waist to display the same slogan.

In February last year the protest group clashed with Italian police during Milan Fashion Week after a demonstration against the use of anorexic models.

The topless protesters wore jeans and had handwritten slogans such as 'Fashion = Fascism' and 'Anorexia' scrawled across their chests.

A similar protest was held in January in the Swiss resort of Davos in January, where the World Economic Forum held its annual meeting.
