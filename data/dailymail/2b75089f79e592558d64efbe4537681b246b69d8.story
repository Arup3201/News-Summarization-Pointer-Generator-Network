Real Madrid full back Marcelo has described Isco as his most impressive team-mate, ranking the 22-year-old above the likes of Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo.

The youngster has been in superb form this season, even as Real's results have suffered since the turn of the year.

And Marcelo insists Isco has been even more remarkable in training, where he does things the Brazilian considered impossible.

'Isco is the one who impresses me the most,' Marcelo told Real Madrid youth team players this week when he joined former Real star Guti at a training session.

'He works wonders with the ball in every training session that a normal player can't do. It's like he has glue on his feet.'

The 26-year-old, the club's third alternative as captain behind Iker Casillas and Sergio Ramos, also talked to the young stars about leadership.

'Being captain of Real Madrid is an honour and a big responsibility,' he said.

'I did not know it was going to be a captain at 26, I work very hard and I have to share my virtues to my teammates. It's a very big responsibility.'

Isco has been on top form this season, playing a key part for Real Madrid in La Liga and the Champions League
