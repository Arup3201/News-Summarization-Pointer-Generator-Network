Banned: Colman Chadam, 11, has been removed from Jordan Middle School in Palo Alto

A California schoolboy has been forced to stay at home after his school banned him from attending classes because he carries the gene for cystic fibrosis.

Colman Chadam, 11, carries the genetic mutation for cystic fibrosis but doesn't actually have the disease and shows no outward symptoms.

The disease is incurable and life threatening and causes the body to create a thick mucous that clogs the lungs and can cause deadly infections.

But although it's not contagious, people with the disease or the gene can pose a risk to each other through bacterial cross-contamination if they are in close contact.Â 

The disease effects about 30,000 Americans but more than 10 million Americans carry the defective cystic fibrosis gene without knowing it.

Colman's parents say their son poses no risk to other pupils and are fighting the decision, made by Jordan Middle School, in Palo Alto.

Teachers said Colman must be removed as an undisclosed number of other students at the school already have the disease.

The school argues that, if Colman were allowed to continue attending classes, there is a risk of cross-contamination.

Colman's parents, who said the school has overreacted, are waiting for a court ruling on the matter next Thursday.

They say that their son does not have the disease and shows no symptoms - an assertion backed by the family's doctor.

They also claim they did the right thing in 
disclosing Colman's genetic predisposition to cystic fibrosis on a 
school medical form at the beginning of the year.

But they did not 
expected the school to take such a hard line and bar Colman from 
the school.

Colman's mother Jennifer Chadam told the San Francisco Chronicle: 'They made this decision without seeing one medical record on my son.'

She added: 'If I felt Colman was a risk to others, I would move him. I don't want anyone to get sick.'

Colman told Today: 'I was sad but at 
the same time I was mad because I understood that I hadn't done anything
wrong. It feels like I'm being bullied in a way that is not right.'

At the heart of the problem lies conflicting opinion on the risk of cross-infection among cystic fibrosis sufferers, or those who are at genetic risk for the disease.

The school says it has consulted with medical experts and has taken the 'zero risk' option in removing Colman from the school.

The plight of the Chadams supports a UK study last year that claimed students with allergies often suffered discrimination at school.

The study, from the University of Leicester, said affected children often felt isolated, stigmatised or left out of school activities.

Symptoms: While cystic fibrosis is mainly related to lung problems, it can also affect general growth, heart function, fertility, digestion and sinuses

Cystic fibrosis is a recessive genetic disorder predominantly affecting the lungs. It can also affect the heart, liver, pancreas and intestine.

The name refers to the characteristic scarring (fibrosis) and cyst formation within the pancreas, first recognised in the 1930s.

The disease can be treated with antibiotics and other medications but is only manageable, not curable.

It is caused by a mutation in the gene that regulates sweat, digestive juices, and mucus. Most people have two working copies of the gene, although only one is needed to prevent cystic fibrosis.

If both parents have a mutation of the gene, cystic fibrosis will occur in their offspring.

It is most common among Caucasians.

Symptoms include salty tasting skin, poor growth and poor weight gain, frequent chest infections, coughing or shortness of breath.

Major symptoms appear in infancy, so late onset of the disease is uncommon.
