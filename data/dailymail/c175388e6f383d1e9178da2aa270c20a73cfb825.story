Anne Lakey, 54, has been charged with seven counts of indecent assault

An acclaimed headteacher has been charged with indecently assaulting a boy 25 years ago.

Anne Lakey, 54, was lauded nationally for her work as chief executive of the Durham Federation of Schools after overseeing the biggest improvement in GCSE results in the country.

She has been charged with seven counts of indecent assault on a boy under 16 said to have occurred between July 1989 and May 1990.

Noelle Brockbank, Senior Crown Prosecutor at CPS North East, said: 'The decision was made in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors.'

Lakey will appear at Consett Magistrates' Court on December 18.

The Durham Federation of Schools includes Durham Community Business College, in Ushaw Moor, and Fyndoune Community College, in Sacriston.

Fyndoune has previously been named the country's most improved secondary school after the number of pupils achieving at least five GCSEs, including maths and English, rose from 26% to 80%.

Both colleges were judged 'outstanding' by Ofsted school inspectors in 2011.

Sir Michael Wilshaw, the Chief Inspector of Schools, praised the head's 'inspiring leadership'.

Anne Lakey was released on police bail to appear before Consett Magistrates Court on December 18
