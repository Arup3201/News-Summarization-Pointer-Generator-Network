Prestwick Airport should maintain its status as a gateway to Glasgow and become a launchpad to outer space to secure its long-term future, a new analysis has concluded.

The Glasgow Prestwick Airport strategic vision said the Ayrshire terminal's association with Glasgow, some 35 miles away, is its 'best asset'.

A local campaign to change its name to Robert Burns International Airport, in recognition of the Alloway-born bard, would 'damage the airport's business prospects, notably with inbound passengers', it said.

The vision also confirms Prestwick's bid to be the site of the UK's first spaceport, which it said will be 'the catalyst for transformational change'.

In the meantime, Prestwick faces some challenges including aged infrastructure, a maintenance backlog, a railway station in need of a £4.75 million refurbishment, the need for a new primary radar within the next five years and Ryanair's expansion into Glasgow Airport.

Scottish airports are also 'disproportionally affected' by air passenger duty (APD) due to their geographic location and Prestwick is calling for changes to UK aviation policy leading to a reduction in or removal of APD.

Glasgow Prestwick chief executive Iain Cochrane said: 'We are currently under consideration to become Britain's first spaceport.

'We satisfy - and in some cases exceed - all the essential criteria such as infrastructure, weather and airspace, and securing spaceport status would be the catalyst for transformational change at the airport - from boosting revenue from space-related flight testing, establishing an attractive modernised hi-tech image and bringing in visitors and tourists.

'It will also bring significant economic benefits to both Ayrshire and Scotland.'

Plans to rename Prestwick Airport the Robert Burns International Airport have been criticised, despite the bard being Scotland's most famous poet 

Prestwick spaceport would be a magnet for tourists, industrial tenants, payload operators and sub-technology businesses, the report said.

It added: 'Glasgow Prestwick Airport is a well-recognised name and its best asset is the Glasgow mention.

'Removing it will weaken its link with its main origination and destination market, being Glasgow.

'The airport will explore opportunities which may include the incorporation of a Robert Burns theme to form part of the general re-positioning of the airport landside area.'

The report notes that Prestwick Airport was built in the 1960s and 'the infrastructure is aged'.

'In recent years the capital expenditure has mainly been focused on areas that were viewed as essential to maintain a safe and secure asset and keep the airport operational,' it said.

'This approach has resulted in a maintenance backlog in certain areas and also highlighted that there are some critical items of equipment which are coming close to end of life and will need replacement.

'The airport has developed a structured capital plan that will address much of the infrastructure backlog issues over the next few years.

'This excluded the costs in relation to the rail station.

'It also excludes the replacement costs of the existing primary radar which will be required within the next five years, though alternative funding options are being considered in relation to this.'

Prestwick is in need of improvement, and remains a key component of Scotland's aviation market

It added: 'There is a significant need to refurbish the rail station and skywalk connecting it to the airport, with initial estimates of this being up to £4.75 million.'

It continued: 'Scottish airports have been disproportionally affected by APD due to geographic location and therefore a comprehensive route development solution will be crucial to support the proposed passenger growth.

'Major growth will only be achievable if a substantial APD mitigation plan and route development support are put in place.'

The Scottish government bought the struggling airport for £1 last year and later announced £10m in loan funding.

The cash was committed towards operating costs, a repairs backlog and to make improvements to the terminal building.

In July 2014 Ryanair announced the establishment of a base at Glasgow Airport in addition to Prestwick and Edinburgh.

The immediate impact was 'an overall reduction in passenger volumes from the airport which has an adverse impact on its immediate revenue generating capabilities', it said.

Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: 'We have been clear from the start of this process that there is no quick fix for the airport but there are opportunities to improve in all areas of the business, from increasing passenger and freight traffic to putting forward a bid for the UK spaceport programme.

'We are confident there is a place for Glasgow Prestwick Airport in the evolving Scottish aviation market and look forward to seeing it grow and develop in the future.'
