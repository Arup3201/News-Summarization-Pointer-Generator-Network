On track: A high-speed Hitachi train on its way to London. The firm vows to boost its staff by 1,600 by 2017

The firm behind Japan’s famous bullet train is set to move to Britain in a major boost for the economy.

Industrial giant Hitachi is planning to invest hundreds of millions of pounds in the country and increase the number of its UK staff from 200 to 1,800 within three years.

In a highly unusual move for a Japanese conglomerate, Hitachi has appointed a British director, Alistair Dormer, to lead its global train business from London.

Hitachi Rail Global is also targeting lucrative rail contracts here, including bidding for work on the controversial £50billion HS2 project.

The manufacturer of the bullet train aims to grow from a business employing 2,500 people today to 4,000 people over the next two and a half years.

The company’s biggest train markets around the world are Japan, Taiwan and the UK and its annual sales are £1.67billion – but the firm plans to increase this to £2.5billion over the next few years.

After the move, which was welcomed last night as ‘an incredible vote of confidence’ in Britain, the company is likely to use its new UK base to try to win work in Europe, taking on rivals including Alstom – the French maker of the Eurostar, and the German giant Siemens.

Hitachi’s nuclear arm is also planning to build two power stations – in Gloucestershire and on Anglesey – after buying the project from its previous owners for £700million.

Yesterday’s announcement comes months after Hitachi said its new factory in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, would employ more than 700 when it opens next year.

The site will produce trains to run on the Great Western line and East Coast main line after the group won a £1.2billion contract.

The high-tech company will be bidding for work on the controversial HS2 project in the UK

‘We see it as a major operation in the
 UK and we want to build in the UK for the rest of Europe,’ Mr Dormer 
said yesterday, adding: ‘Both the UK and Japan remain important as 
markets for Hitachi Rail.

‘With
 our train factory in the North East of England now under construction, 
we will work to realise our export potential from the UK.

‘It would be a great idea to build high-speed trains in the North East.’

Hitachi's deal marks a U-turn for its European boss – who had previously warned that  the UK would struggle to attract investment unless it decided to join the euro.

Sir Stephen Gomersall has held a number of influential positions within the Japanese giant’s European division, including chief executive and chairman.

He has been responsible for deals that brought more than £1billion of manufacturing to the UK.

But previously, as Britain’s ambassador to Japan, he warned Tony Blair that foreign firms would abandon the UK unless it could show it was ‘on track’ to sign up to the single currency.

In a memo to the Prime Minister in 2000 he said Britain was ‘not a safe bet’ for foreign firms because of its reluctance to ditch the pound in favour of the euro.

He added: ‘Any sign that the Government was backtracking from its timetable could trigger a much stronger move towards disinvestment in the manufacturing sector.’

James Wharton, Conservative MP for 
Stockton South, said: ‘Hitachi’s Newton Aycliffe factory is one of the 
biggest investments in our area for a generation.

‘This a very positive sign as it gives people a lot more confidence that Hitachi is here for the long term.’

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin added: ‘This is an incredible vote of confidence in a growing Britain that is exporting more and making great things once again.

‘Nothing says that better than the company that built the first bullet train putting its HQ here to sell abroad, alongside a new factory and new jobs in northern England.’

And Business Secretary Vince Cable said: ‘This demonstrates a huge vote of confidence in Britain, its workers and its rail industry from one of Japan’s biggest businesses.’

Chancellor George Osborne also welcomed the move, saying: ‘For people like me who have grown up with news of manufacturing jobs leaving Britain, isn’t it fantastic that manufacturing jobs are coming back to Britain.’

Once the envy of the world, Britain’s train-making industry has declined in recent years as manufacturers sought out cheaper options overseas.

In 2011 the Government came under fire for awarding a £6billion Thameslink contract to German-owned Siemens rather than Bombardier –which at the time ran the UK’s last train factory in Derby.

The move led to the loss of hundreds of British jobs. But Bombardier was given a welcome boost last month after winning a £1billion contract to provide trains for Crossrail.

The company will build 65 trains for the cross-London rail service, which is due to be completed by 2018.
