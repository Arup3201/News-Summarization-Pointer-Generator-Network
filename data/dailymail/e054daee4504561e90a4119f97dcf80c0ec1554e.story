The biological family of US aid worker Peter Kassig, who was beheaded by ISIS militants have claimed they were let down by the FBI who did not tell them he was missing or support them. 

Last week Kassig's parents revealed on Twitter he has been adopted as a newborn and thanked  his birthmother, Rhonda Schwindt, that she chose them to be his parents.

But now Rhonda says the FBI has not supported her and her two children because they do not meet the agency's legal definition of next of kin.

She says the FBI kept his captivity a secret from them for nearly six months, but provided support to his parents, reports the Indianapolis Star.

Rhonda also says they were denied federal assistance in finding grief counseling and told by the FBI to keep quiet even after his parents and friends were encouraged to speak up in an unsuccessful attempt to save him.

Rhonda, who is now married and lives in Indianapolis, was 25 when she gave Kassig up for adoption because she did not feel equipped to become a single mother.

She picked Ed and Paula to his parents - they met all her criteria, although she had wanted Kassig to have siblings.

In 2006, when was 17, Kassig went to visit Schwindt and meet his siblings, 12-year-old Jana and hugged 10-year-old Sam and their relationship continued from there

The couple kept her updated with his life and when he was six, he wrote a letter to her thanking her for letting him be adopted.

In 2006, when was 17, Kassig went to visit Rhonda and meet his siblings, 12-year-old Jana and hugged 10-year-old Sam and their relationship continued from there.

Even though they only got to spend eight short years together, the three siblings reportedly developed a very close bond. 

In 2007, when Kassig returned from Iraq following a four-month deployment, the Schwindt's said that they noticed he has changed and he seemed  angry and they were forced to pull back from him several times.

Although Jana always got back in contact with him, 18-year-old Sam,who is currently a freshman at DePaul University in Chicago, only built a relationship with him when Kassig returned to the Middle East in 2012.

'I added him on Facebook and I was like, 'what the hell is going on Peter? We're brothers. We need to fix this.'' Sam said.

Just days before Kassig was captured, he was supposed to have a video chat with Sam, his 'Little Bro,' but the teenager had to cancel because he had made plans with friends - a decision he regrets to this day.

But then Kassig's Facebook went and the family did not hear from him. 

The 26-year-old former US Army Ranger was taken captive while on a humanitarian mission to Syria in October 2013.  

'Sam spent five and a half months desperately seeking his brother when Peter went dark -desperately seeking,' said Rhonda.

She does not blame the Kassigs for keeping the secret at the government's insistence, but says the FBI is at fault. 

Eventually Sam wrote to the Kassigs and they found out.

Touching moment: After Kassig's murder, his younger brother, Sam Schwindt, shared online this old photo of himself as a boy with Peter dressed in his US Army Rangers uniform 

Kassig sent Jana a letter while being held hostage by ISIS - only one of two  he was able to write.

But Jana does not  have an exact copy of the letter - they were told by the FBI, the original was processed as evidence and destroyed.

In the letter he wrote: 'You are the best thing that has ever happened to me; you and your brother.' 

On November 16, ISIS released a graphic video showing that Kassig, who had converted to Islam while in captivity, had been beheaded.

On November 11, less than a week before the release of the gruesome ISIS video, showing that Kassig, who had converted to Islam while in captivity, had been beheaded. Rhonda wrote on her Facebook wall: 'I want my son Peter home safely.'

She says the FBI did tell them family of his death.

Rhonda says she had several meetings with the FBI, in which she asked for help finding a therapist who specialized in traumatic grief, but she said the government refused. 

'I was like, 'Peter has three blood relatives, and they're sitting right in front of you,'' she said.

'And the people in his darkest moments, who did he think about? His father. And his mother. And he thought about his brother and sister. 

The siblings are both now in therapy. 

Last week Sam posted an old photo of himself as a young boy standing next to his big brother in his US Army Rangers uniform in front a monument engraved with 'Ranger Creed.'

A day after the ISIS video recording was made public online, Sam shared a moving tribute to Kassig on his Facebook page.

'It's incredibly strange to lose someone you love,' he wrote. 

'It just does not seem real. It always seems like in life that there will be more time, but you really can never know.

'Just please, for me, if you're not talking to someone you love, send them a message and reconnect. You never know when you may lose someone. I will always love you, Peter.'

Much like her big brother, Jana Schwindt, 20, has dedicated her life to humanitarian work.

Since August of this year, she has been working as a kennel attendant at the Indianapolis Humane Society.

The FBI issued a brief statement to the Indianapolis Star: 'The law and the Attorney General Guidelines permit and/or encourage inclusion with regard to providing victim services, but due to privacy considerations, the FBI is not in a position to comment on any specific services offered or provided to victim or victim families.'
