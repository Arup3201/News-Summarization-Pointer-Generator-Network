After struggling to keep some of his own backbenchers under control, never mind the LibDems, yesterday must have been a welcome relief for David Cameron.

He made an enthusiastic new friend who was very pleased to see him – and only too happy to play ball.

The Prime Minister met Phyllis the mongrel at Battersea Dogs and Cats Home as he toured the South London rescue centre to mark the arrival of its 1,000th volunteer.

Warm welcome: Prime Minister David Cameron made a new friend, Phyllis the mongrel, when he visited Battersea Dogs and Cats Home

It was Mr Cameron’s first visit to the home, although Larry the Downing Street cat came from Battersea.

The Prime Minister praised the 'fantastic' work of volunteers at the centre as he was given a tour.

He said he believes those who give up their time to help others get an 'enormous amount of satisfaction'.

Mr Cameron said: 'Battersea Dogs and Cats Home have been doing fantastic work for over 150 years and I'm delighted to congratulate them on their 1,000th volunteer.'

The PM was greeted by a guard of honour made up of nine dogs currently waiting to be found new homes.

Among them was Yorkshire terrier Bertie, who arrived at the centre three days ago after being found wandering the streets of London.

Friendly: Mr Cameron remarked that Bertie appeared 'good-natured', just before the little dog wriggled out of his arms a split second after being passed to him

Mr Cameron remarked that Bertie appeared ‘good-natured’, only for the little dog to wriggle out of his arms a split second after being passed to him.

Phyllis, who was found in a Marks & Spencer car park in June, proved to be more loyal, happily chasing a tennis ball thrown by the PM.

If only the voters were so easily pleased, eh, Mr Cameron?
