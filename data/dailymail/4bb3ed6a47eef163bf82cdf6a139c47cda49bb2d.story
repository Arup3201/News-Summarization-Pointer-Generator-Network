Brendan Rodgers insists it is a formality that Steven Gerrard will get a new Liverpool contract as he looks to play into his late thirties.

Gerrard brought an end to his 114-cap England career on Monday, saying the time was right for him to step aside in order to maximise his chances of being a dominant influence in Liverpool’s midfield for the next ‘three or four’ years.

Commitment: Brendan Rodgers believes Steven Gerrard can play 'well into his thirties' for Liverpool

He last renewed terms with his only professional club last July, before Liverpool embarked on their tour of South East Asia and Australia. That contract now has 11 months to run, but the club have been working on a deal through the summer.

Rodgers was a key figure in discussions with Gerrard when he was deciding what to do about England and Liverpool’s manager is looking forward to the opportunity of  continuing working with a player who he has regularly said has ‘given him everything and more’ since he’s been at Anfield.

‘A lot has gone on over the summer,’ said Rodgers. ‘I am very happy that Steven is now going to commit  to Liverpool and I am sure that (his contract) is something we will look at. I know he can continue to play beyond this season.

‘I have always said that. Now he doesn’t have international football, he will have that freshness. Listen, for his own mind, I’m sure he will want it sorted out, absolutely. You never want to leave players with not too long to go on their contract. It is something I am sure will get sorted.’

Though Gerrard turned 34 in May, his importance to Liverpool cannot be understated and last season he recorded the most assists in the Barclays Premier League (14) and scored 13 goals of his own.

If the World Cup did not go according to plan for him, there is no sign that it has left his mark and Gerrard has looked sharp as Rodgers has put Liverpool’s squad through their paces on the training fields at  Harvard University this week.

The intention is to give Gerrard his first action of pre-season on Sunday in Chicago, where Liverpool face Olympiacos, and Rodgers is expecting his players to take another step forward after they lost 1-0 to Roma at Fenway Park in the early hours of  morning.

‘There was lots of encouragement from the game,’ said Rodgers. ‘We are going to be in the Champions League, which is why we have taken games like Roma and Borussia  Dortmund (in August).’

One issue arising from the match with Roma was the shoulder injury to Fabio Borini. The striker, who could make a £14million move to Sunderland, will miss the rest of the tour but it is not thought the injury would prevent the transfer going ahead.

Aside from launching Gerrard back into action, Rodgers will also use the workout in Chicago to give Lazar Markovic — a £20m signing from Benfica — his first appearance.

Rui Costa, the legendary Portugal midfielder who is now Benfica’s sporting director, told Sportsmail: ‘Markovic is a huge talent and has the speed and skills can make a difference in the Premier League. He’s not a physical player, but he has the ability and the flexibility to escape defenders easily.

‘Apart from that, he’s a really focused player. He loves football and enjoys playing and watching the game.

‘Markovic is also very cold blooded when he’s in a one-to-one (situation) and he’s not afraid on facing the opponents. He’s always eager to learning, so I think he will adapt himself very quickly.’

Markovic is one of a number of players who have been signed to help Liverpool progress and show there can be life after Luis Suarez.

Liverpool handled his £75million departure to Barcelona, quickly, quietly and efficiently and the club’s principal owner John W Henry felt the moment was right to sell him.

‘It was time for Luis — and time for the club — to make a break,’ said Henry, who along with chairman Tom Werner has sanctioned Liverpool’s heavy summer spending.

‘He brought so much to the club but we brought a lot to Luis.’

And as a message to any fans who might be fearful, Henry promised: ‘I think (next season) you will see a very explosive Liverpool offense.’
