More than 100 people have been shot, stabbed and possibly burned to death in the Syrian city of Homs this week in a suspected massacre by President Bashar al-Assad's troops.

A monitoring group said women and children were among the 106 victims killed by forces who stormed Basatin al-Hasawiya, an impoverished district on the fringes of the city.

The reports, which are not independently verified, potentially shed further light on the authoritarian regime's use of violence against its own citizens.

Around 60,000 people have been killed in the bloody civil war that has raged in the country for nearly two years between rebel forces and the state army loyal to President Assad.

Rami Abdelrahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said: 'The Observatory has the names of 14 members of one family, including three children, and information on other families who were completely killed, including one of 32 people.'

Abdelrahman, a Syrian who has documented human rights violations in Syria since 2006 and now reports on killings by both sides of the 22-month-old conflict, demanded that the UN investigate the deaths.

The deaths of 108 people, including nine children and 34 women, were also recorded in the town of Houla, Homs province in May 2011.

U.N. monitors blamed the army and pro-Assad militia for the attack.

Homs saw some of the biggest anti-Assad protests at the start of the revolt and heavy bombardment levelled whole neighbourhoods.

The attacks killed thousands of people as the army attacked rebels who had moved into the city.

The UN sent observers to Syria in April 2011 but after several attacks on their convoys they left in August, complaining that both sides had chosen the path of war.

Abu Yazen, an opposition activist in Homs, said the rebel Free Syrian Army occasionally entered the farmlands of Basatin al-Hasawiya to attack a nearby military academy.

'Assad's forces punish civilians for allowing the rebels to enter the area,' he said

Another activist said it was unclear which group carried out the attack, but said some of the victims appeared to have been burnt after they were killed - something the opposition says is often done by the pro-Assad shabbiha militia.

However, many houses had been torched during the raid, which could also explain the burnt bodies.

The shabbiha are drawn largely from Assad's minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam.

Homs has seen some of the worst sectarian violence between Alawites and other minorities and Syria's majority Sunni Muslim population, who are leading the uprising.
