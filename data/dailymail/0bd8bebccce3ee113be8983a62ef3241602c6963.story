The New York dad who shot dead his girlfriend, one of their daughters and his girlfriend's mother before taking his own life thought the woman was cheating on him, according to reports.

Nightclub bouncer Jonathan Walker, 34, is believed to have shot Shantai Hale, 31, his seven-year-old daughter Kayla Walker, and Hale's mother Viola Warren, 62, in their heads at their Springfield Gardens, Queens home in the early hours of Saturday.

Walker, who was later found dead from a gunshot wound to his head in his car, also shot his 12-year-old daughter Christina in the head, but she survived and managed to call 911.

Hours before the attack, Walker was overheard at a liquor store saying he thought Hale was cheating, possibly with more than one person, a law enforcement source told the New York Post.

He got drunk before skipping his bouncer shift on Friday evening and then headed home, where he shot his two daughters.

He shot them because he said he would prefer them to die than go into foster care after he killed their mother, a source told the Post.

Walker then shot his common-law-wife, a computer analyst, and her mother, who worked at JFK airport, in another bedroom before driving from the home and taking his own life inside his car.

The car, a 2013 GMC Acadia, and his dead body were found in a wooded area near JFK Airport.

A .45-caliber firearm was recovered from the scene, authorities said. The father had apparently used the same gun to shoot his family and take his own life.

Christina, who managed to call 911 and open the door for first responders, was rushed to Long Island Jewish Medical Center and is in a medically induced coma after undergoing surgery to ease swelling on her brain. 

Victim: Viola Warren, his girlfriend's mother, was also fatally shot in the head during the early-morning attack

Killed: He fatally shot Kayla, left, her mother, right, and her grandmother. He also shot Kayla's 12-year-old sister Christina, but the girl survived her wounds and managed to call 911

Doctors are 'hopeful', her uncle, Silford Warren, said. 

'She moved her head backward at just the right moment when [her father] fired and that probably saved her life,' he told the Post. 

New York City Councilman Donovan Richards said Walker was with friends moments before the shooting, and said he was going home to watch Netflix. 

'What happened to make him snap?' Richards said, Newsday reported. 'That's the million-dollar question that everybody is trying to find out.' Richards added: 'It doesn't add up, it just does not add up.' 

Chief detective Robert K. Boyce told Newsday that the NYPD responded to domestic incidents at the home in 2005 and 2006 but called them 'nominal matters'.

He also said Walker had been arrested twice previously, but that both cases are sealed.
