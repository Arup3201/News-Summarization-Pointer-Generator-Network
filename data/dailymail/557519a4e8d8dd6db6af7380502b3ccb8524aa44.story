Watch the political advertising and Elizabeth Warren, the leading Democratic Senate candidate in Massachusetts, either 'sides with extreme left' protesters or has a history of being too cosy with Wall Street.

That is the criticism spewing from political activists behind conservative Crossroads GPS, which has ties to former President George W Bush's former top adviser Karl Rove.

Outside groups on both sides are spending millions of dollars on the race, highlighting the national prominence of the fight between Warren and freshman GOP Senator Scott Brown for the seat held for nearly 50 years by the late Senator Edward M Kennedy.

Attack: Last month, an ad by political advocacy group Crossroads accused Elizabeth Warren of siding 'with extreme left' groups such as Occupy Wall Street

But the level of spending also 
foreshadows the role that such groups, including special political 
action committees, will play in many of next fall's big political 
matchups.

The flood of money and ads from outside the state is expected to surge as the Warren-Brown race intensifies, according to Ken
Goldstein, president of Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks 
spending on political ads.

'Massachusetts is at the end of the 
spear of what will be the big trend and the big story of 2012,' Mr Goldstein said.

Super PACs have been showing their 
strength in marquis Senate races. The Supreme Court, in a trio of 
decisions capped by the landmark Citizens United case in 2010, eased 
restrictions on the use of corporate money in political campaigns and 
paved the way for such spending.

Massachusetts is front and centre, with
the conservative Crossroads GPS spending $1.1million on one spot 
casting Warren as aligned with radical elements of the Occupy Wall 
Street movement and another that has her siding with Wall Street 
bankers.

Under fire: A second Crossroads ad painted Warren as being too cozy with Wall Street when she oversaw the Treasury's handling of the financial industry bailout

Criticism: The Crossroads ads painted Warren as pro big government

Crossroads GPS is an affiliate of 
American Crossroads, a group with ties to Rove. The groups spent more than $38 
million to defeat Democrats in the 2010 midterms, raising money from 
large donors, including many whose identities remain unknown.

Crossroads GPS was by far the largest and most influential super PAC in that campaign year.

Last month, one Crossroads ad used 
spliced images of Warren with rowdy Occupy Wall Street protesters to 
claim that she 'sides with extreme left' protesters who 'attack police, 
do drugs and trash public parks.'

Warren at one point said her 
philosophies provided the intellectual underpinnings for the Occupy 
movement, but she has backed off a bit, saying she supports the movement
but that the protesters must follow the law.

A second Crossroads ad then painted 
Warren as being too cozy with Wall Street when she headed a 
congressional panel that oversaw the Treasury's handling of the $700 
billion financial industry bailout, a charge Warren has dismissed as 
ridiculous given her background as a consumer advocate and leading 
critic of many Wall Street's practices.

The attacks prompted Warren to spend 
about $1million on her first TV campaign ad, in which she says: 'Before 
you hear a bunch of ridiculous attack ads, I want to tell you who I am.'

Warren is an especially inviting 
target for Republicans because many voters don't know much about her, 
which Anthony Corrado, a campaign finance expert at Colby College in 
Maine, said explains why these groups have become active at such an 
early stage of the campaign.

'The first information can often have a powerful influence,' he said.

Outside groups have also gone after Brown.

Not unscathed: Freshman GOP Senator Scott Brown, whom Warren hopes to defeat next year, is portrayed as an enemy of the environment

The League of Conservation Voters and
the League of Women Voters have spent nearly $3million on separate ad 
campaigns accusing Brown of casting anti-environmental votes. Both 
groups have also run ads against Democrats in other states.

The League of Women Voters' ad rapped
Brown for voting with other Senate Republicans to ban the Environmental
Protection Agency from controlling gases blamed for global warming. It 
showed a child breathing through an oxygen mask and urged Brown to 
'protect the people and not the polluters.' Brown complained that the ad
was 'political demagoguery.'

One spot by the League of 
Conservation Voters slammed Brown for siding with 'big oil' and voting 
'repeatedly against protecting our environment and public health.' He 
has denounced that ad as a distortion.

The League of Conservation Voters said Brown scored a zero on the group's national environmental report card.

The early wave of attack ads has hurt
both candidates, a recent University of Massachusetts-Lowell/Boston 
Herald poll found. The percentage of voters who said they had an 
unfavourable view of Brown rose from 29 per cent to 35 per cent between 
late September and early December. Those viewing Warren unfavourably 
increased from 18 per cent to 27 per cent.

Brown wants third-party groups to 
pull their negative commercials. Warren draws the line at unfair attack 
ads but defends the rights of political action committees and other 
independent groups to run ads.

Such talk won't stop outside groups from swarming the airwaves with negative ads, however.

'This is just a harbinger of things to come,' said Corrado.
