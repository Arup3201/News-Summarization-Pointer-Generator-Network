It seems that people may get a little more than they bargained for if they're hoping to get their bearings in a certain regional town before they head there. 

When peeking at the Victorian town of Bendigo on Google Maps, a certain piece of graffiti  makes it a little hard to see the streets.

The drawing, which appears to have been scrawled on the lens of the truck's camera, suggests the artist was feeling a little cheeky when they exposed the camera to the wrath of their pen.

A green piece of artwork - which looks strikingly similar to a penis - obscures the view of the quiet town in central Victoria.

Barely any roads in the suburb are safe from the lurking beast, which hovers over houses and looms over laneways.

Even the centre of town couldn't avoid being overshadowed by the green monster which hangs above the local newsagent and pubs. 

Similar shots of the cheeky graffiti have been pointed out before, but it's unclear why the satellite images haven't been updated.

The imaging was done in February 2010 - but almost five years on the penis still remains.

Observant Reddit users tried to unravel the confusion this week - with one sleuth even suggesting that they had figured out the spot where the crime took place.

'It seems to vanish/started (sic) at the New Victoria Hotel, I guess they stopped for lunch when the artist struck', seewhaticare wrote. 

Another took a more light-hearted approach suggesting: 'if that's what your penis looks like, I suggest consulting your local GP.' 

One more said they believed the creation to be more plant-like, posting 'it looks like a typical Melbourne cactus to me.'
