Sydney will get a taste of the tropics on New Year's Eve with the world-famous fireworks display illuminating the sky with silver and gold palm trees.

With over seven tonnes of fireworks set to be launched throughout the night, the city can expect one of its most colourful displays yet.

Pyro technician Fortunato Foti, who has been involved in the event since 2000, has created a series of new shapes and colours for this year's event, including silver and gold palm trees.

Alongside the usual 9pm and midnight displays there will be a third mini-fireworks display at 10.40pm, known as the Inspire moment.

'This year we've focused on making the displays as colourful as possible - you'll see a lot of metallics, as well as bright reds, greens, blues and purples - as some fun new shapes, including palm trees with shimmering centres and multicoloured ends,' Mr Foti said.

The fireworks include 11,000 shells, 25,000 shooting comets and over 100,000 individual effects.

About 1.6 million people are expected to gather around the harbour for Wednesday night's display.

The total cost of the Sydney New Year's Eve celebrations is $7.2 million, with $750,000 going on fireworks.

The event's producer, Aneurin Coffey, says this is on a par with the spend for previous years.

The creative ambassador for the celebrations, actor Jack Thompson, said he was inspired by an ode to Sydney written by his father.

'Forty years ago my father wrote a poem in praise of Sydney. He was a senior feature writer and producer for ABC radio,' Thompson said.

Thompson believes the city needs this colourful celebration now more than ever.

'Somebody said to me 'what are you looking forward to on the night?' and I said 'party, party party,' because that's what's important. We tend to throw it away and say it's just a party but celebration is probably one of the most important human activities,' he said.

As the city has struggled in recent weeks to come to terms with tragedy, Thompson said it was important for people to get together in large numbers to celebrate and simply say yes about life.

'If you see tragedy as exemplifying the human condition then you will find yourself a very sad person. And when you recognise that what actually typifies the human condition is our joy of life, our children our celebration of family and our celebration of who we are and where we live, if this is God's creation, should we not celebrate it?' he said.

From the old film, based on the Fatty Finn comic strip, to his own childhood growing up on the northern beaches and in Paddington, Thompson has been inspired to tell the city's story through the fireworks.

'When you come to the centre you'll see it's the stories, the tales of Sydney, where Sydney has come from who these people are, is what makes this city,' he said.
