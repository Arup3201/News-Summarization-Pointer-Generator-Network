Whether you're super slim or ultra curvy, cellulite is the bane of so many 
women's lives.

From
 detox diets to firming lotions and potions, there is no shortage of gimmicks out there to help banish the 
bumps.

But the latest intriguing product claiming to have cellulite-busting powers is a pair of caffeine-infused pants that promise to break down cellulite while you wear them.

Sexy slimmers: The new range of underwear from a French lingerie brand is infused with caffeine, which it claims beats cellulite

French lingerie brand Simone Pérèle have launched a shapewear range called Top Model, which aims to be sexy yet effective at fighting the orange peel.

The lace and Lycra lingerie contains microfibre microencapsulated with slimming agents  - the main one being caffeine - as well as vitamin 
E, retinol and aloé vera.

The brand claim that the shapewear, which lasts for 100 washes, has body-sculpting actions which flatten the stomach 
and slim the hips as well as lifting the buttocks.

The slimming agents are microencapsulated into the fabric which are then released upon contact with skin.

It sounds too good to be true - but in an independent study over 28 days the firm found that 63 per cent of women wearing the shapewear experienced a reduction of cellulite.

While caffeine is better known for 
boosting flagging energy levels, a range of new products like this maintains that it 
can help boost blood flow and banish cellulite.

Nataliya Robinson, of Nataliya Robinson Skin Clinic, said: 'First of all there is no known treatment for cellulite than totally eliminates the condition.

'My opinion on cellulite is that it is a disorder of connective tissues (the tissue is damaged and cannot support the deepest layers of the skin), sluggish lymphatic circulation, hormonal problem-estrogen activity.

'As poor circulation aggravate cellulite then application of caffeine, gotu kola and fennel may help to increase the sluggish circulation and by wearing on daily basis shape wear (or support hose) will support the connective tissue especially during the exercise to help encourage healing.'
