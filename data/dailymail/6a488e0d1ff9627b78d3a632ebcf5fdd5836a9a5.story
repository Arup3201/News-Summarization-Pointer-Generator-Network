The mother of a teenager with autism has been charged with attempted murder as police believe she tried killing herself and her daughter.

Kelli Stapleton, 45, is expected to be arraigned in the coming days after her release Thursday from a Grand Rapids, Michigan hospital where she was treated for carbon monoxide poisoning following the failed suicide attempt.

In a statement released, her husband Matt said their daughter Isabelle remains hospitalized in critical condition and unconscious after suffering carbon monoxide poisoning.

Police said she and her daughter were found Tuesday after having suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning.

Mrs Stapleton had been vocal in the difficulties her family faced in treating her daughter’s autism, and kept a blog chronicling their efforts that was titled ‘The Status Woe’.

Isabelle is being treated at a Grand Rapids children's hospital.

Matt Stapleton had reported his wife and their oldest daughter missing Tuesday afternoon after receiving a phone message from Kelli and discovering the van was gone from their home in Elberta, a small community along Lake Michigan and about 30 miles west of Traverse City.

'He took that as a disconcerting message... despondent,' Belcher said.

After police found the van, mother and daughter were rushed to a hospital in Traverse and later moved to Grand Rapids for specialized care.

Kelli Stapleton was taken Thursday to the Benzie County Jail while her daughter is still in doctors care.

‘(Isabelle) is currently receiving help from a respirator and breathing tube, and her blood pressure is stable,' Matt Stapleton wrote about his daughter in his email to media.

'At this time, she is still unresponsive after being lifted from the medically induced coma she was put in for the treatment of her injuries.'

Earlier this year, the family told the Traverse City Record-Eagle about their struggles with medical insurance and state and local agencies as they sought care for their then-13-year-old daughter.

They said her acute autism at times led to violent outbursts from Isabelle. Kelli Stapleton was injured and hospitalized twice.

The couple said a center for autism training and research near Kalamazoo told them their daughter could need as much as eight months of treatment to decrease her aggressive behavior, but the financial cost would be high. Isabelle was put into a month-long program at the center in January.

'She is a great kid with a lot of potential,' Kelli Stapleton told the newspaper.

'She's so smart. She started reading when she was 2. She's got so much to offer, but her aggression is going to limit her life as much as anything.'

Isabelle's outbursts primarily were targeted at her mother and younger sister. An older brother and her father missed most of it.

'When I was home ... I'd be with her most of the time because of the aggressive nature,' Matt Stapleton told the newspaper.

'By the end, I was as much of a target as anybody. Of course, I can defend myself a little differently.

'She's gotten to that point where she can't help herself. She's hurting herself and she's hurting others. She'll always be autistic and she'll always be with us, but unless we're able to get some help for some of these behaviors she has, I don't even know how to predict how the next 20 years will look like.'

'If she was permanently broken, maybe we could have given up at some point. But she's really not,' Kelli told the Record-Eagle.
