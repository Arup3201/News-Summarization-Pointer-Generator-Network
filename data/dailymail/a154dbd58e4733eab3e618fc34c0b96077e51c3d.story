When you are a cat with no fur, a wintery Dublin may not be the ideal place to live - unless of course you gave an owner like these two.

Sphynx cat Gina and her son Prince Charming have limited means of conserving heat due to their lack of fur, but have both been given entire wardrobes to keep warm..

Their owner Zivile Useckaite, who has another eight hairless cats, dresses the champion felines in tiny - but trendy - sweaters, cardigans and hoodies. 

Thanks 'mum': Prince Charming the Sphynx cat wears a coat bought for him by his owner Zivile

Fashion forward feline: Prince Charming's mother Gina, an award-winning champion Sphynx, seems suspicious regarding her knitted polo-neck

At least I look fierce: Gina and her son wear coats in the Dublin climate as they have no fur to keep them warm

The Dublin-based feline fanatic Zivile
 tracks down the feline fashions online.  She explains: ‘They need to be
 kept relatively warm as they have no fur to keep warm.

'Prince
 Charming got his name as he was born on the same day as William and 
Kate's child Prince George, so he has a right to be fussy about what he 
wears.’

Zivile, 30, who has a
 full-time job in cancer research at St James's Hospital, Dublin, said 
that despite their unique appearance this breed of cat is as adorable as
 its furry cousins.

‘I got 
one as a pet first and fell in love, so then I got two more and then it 
got a bit out of control,’ explains Zivile, who was born in Lithuania 
and came to Ireland at age 16.

Ms
 Useckaite has set up The Sphynx Haven Cattery, in Stepaside, Co Dublin,
 where she breeds Canadian and Don Sphynx, whose pedigree can be traced 
back five generations.

Fanatic about felines: Zivile Useckaite  30, who works in cancer research at St James's Hospital, Dublin, has ten Sphynx cats

Only the best: Gina a prime example of one of the hairless breed and a reigning quadruple cat show champion

No pressure: There are high expectations on Prince Charming to follow in his mothers footsteps at shows

The naked truth: Gina and Prince Charming last year when he was still a young kitten

Ms Useckaite's cats are bred for awards shows and are judged on temperament and breed standard.

‘We currently have ten, we first started breeding them three years ago. I'm definitely not getting any more cats though, I'll stick with what I have and show them, there's such a huge amount of work involved that I couldn't possibly take on any more cats, especially when I work full-time.

‘They are indoor cats and only got out of doors in the summertime, generally on a leash. They need a bath once a week, their nails clipped and their eyes and their ears cleaned regularly.’

Zivile travels to shows in Ireland and the UK, and hopes to take some of her cats to shows in Russia and Canada this year.

‘All the cats are show cats and are very high performing cats. For showing they just have to be groomed very well and then they are judged on temperament and the breed standard. If they are doing well, they have to be shown.

The next generation: Mother and son, Gina and Prince Charming, show off the latest additions to their vast wardrobes

‘I think people are coming to like them more and more. Originally it was Eastern European and foreign people who really loved them, but they are becoming more and more popular among Irish and British people, they make really great pets.’

Despite their name, Sphynx cats are from Canada and Russia, not Egypt. And although they have no hair or whiskers they are warm to the touch.

The first modern variety of the breed was started in 1966, in Roncesvalles, Toronto when a hairless kitten named Prune was born to a black and white domestic shorthair cat in Ontario, Canada.

The kitten was mated with its mother (backcrossing), which produced one more naked kitten. Together with a few naked kittens found later it founded the first attempt to create a hairless breed.

Sphynxes are known for their extrovert behaviour. They display a high level of intelligence, curiosity, and affection for their owners.
