An underground website that was dealing cocaine and other illegal drugs before it was recently shut down by the FBI operated much like any other e-commerce site, with photographs of the products and a detailed review system for dealers and users.

Business Insider toured the now-shuttered website for Silk Road and revealed how it operates.

The homepage shows a drop-down menu of items, with drugs including marijuana, ecstasy opioids and psychedelics.

With one Bitcoin worth $47.15, a user could buy 10 hits of LSD from dealer 'Lucydrop'

On the right side of the page, pictures display the different options, from crystal MDMA rocks to nuggets of 'AAA QUALITY WEED, AMAZING.'

To help keep the users anonymous, the site uses Bitcoins as its currency. With one Bitcoin worth $47.15, Business Insider reporter Dylan Love determined he could buy 10 hits of LSD.

Clicking on the LSD product from the dealer 'Lucydrop' reveals that the drug would ship from Canada to anywhere in the world.

Using the site's review system, users are able to determine that Lucydrop has been a member of the siteÂ  for 11 months and ranks in the top 1 percent of sellers with 94.1 percent positive feedback from more than 300 transactions. And Lucydrop has more than 900 'fans.'

Clicking
over to the reviews, Lucydrop's recent customers say things like: 'will 
report back post trip,' 'good dealer,' and 'will update with trip when I
return.'

FBI agents arrested Ross William Ulbricht, who is accused of operating the secret website, which is believed to have brokered more than $1 billion in transactions for illegal drugs and services

The site also sells drug paraphernalia, art, electronics, and herbs.

U.S. law enforcement shut down Silk Road and on Tuesday arrested its alleged owner, Ross William Ulbricht, 29, who was known online as 'Dread Pirate Roberts.' He was arrested in San Francisco.

Ulbricht, who holds an advanced 
degree in chemical engineering, appeared in federal court on Wednesday 
and a bail hearing was set for Friday.

His lawyer Brandon LeBlanc, a public defender, declined to comment.

A Google+ account for Ulbricht had this post on April 9 last year: 'Anybody know someone that works for UPS, FedEX, or DHL?'

Federal prosecutors in New York charged Ulbricht with one count each of narcotics trafficking conspiracy, computer hacking conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy, the filing said.

'Silk Road has emerged as the most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the Internet today,' FBI agent Christopher Tarbell said in the criminal complaint.

The site was used by 'several thousand drug dealers' to sell 'hundreds of kilograms of illegal drugs,' he said.

The site, which has operated since early 2011, also offered tutorials on hacking ATM machines, contact lists for black market connections and counterfeiters, and guns and hit men for sale, according to the charges.

More than 900,000 registered users of the site bought and sold drugs using the digital currency Bitcoin.

In recent media reports about the growing popularity of Bitcoin, the Silk Road website has emerged as part of a darker side to the use of digital currencies.

Through the site, according to the charges, users could buy drugs and have them shipped to an address. Investigators, posing as regular users on Silk Road, made more than 100 purchases of drugs, which were shipped to the New York area.

According to the complaint, Ulbricht, who shortened his alias from Dread Pirate Roberts to DPR when posting on Silk Road's forums, operated the site from San Francisco.

It's a piece of data locked in an internet-based network by a complex equation.

Once released it can be traded and used like money online and can be purchased with real cash. Many websites are now taking Bitcoins as a form of currency.

As well as digital currency, Bitcoin miners enjoy the competitive nature of unlocking the coins.

Famous fans include the Winklevoss twins - famous rivals of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg - who own around 1 per cent of Bitcoins - currently worth around $11million.

It has been dismissed by some as a Ponzi Scheme and touted by others as the future of money. It is not centrally controlled and it's unique and complex set up means the market cannot be altered or hacked, according to the developers.

There are 21 million coins predicted to last until 2140 and their finite nature means they perform more like a commodity, such as gold.

The coins first emerged in 2008 and launched as a network in 2009.

They were introduced by an obscure hacker whose identity is a mystery but is known as Satoshi Nakamoto, which is thought to be a pseudonym.

Users choose a virtual wallet from one of the various providers which enables them to receive, give and trade coins from other users.Bitcoins can be bought from specialist currency exchanges and online marketplaces such as eBay.

At times, he used computers at Internet cafes to access the servers running the website, which employed several technological tools to mask the location of its servers and the identities of its administrators and users.

The complaint described other aspects of Ulbricht's online presence: In a Google+ profile, he described himself as a fan of libertarian economic philosophy and posted videos from the Ludwig von Mises Institute, an Auburn, Alabama-based economics institute.

Reached by phone in Austin, Texas, Ubricht's parents said they had not known what their son was doing in San Francisco.

'He is a really stellar, good person and very idealistic,' said Ulbricht's mother, Lyn Lacava.

'I know he never meant to hurt anyone.'

Ulbricht's father Kirk confirmed his son had received a master's in material sciences from Pennsylvania State University. His thesis was titled: Growth of EuO Thin Films by Molecular Beam Epitaxy.

'He did amazing research on crystals and exotic materials they hoped would have some use for humans, Ulbricht said. 'But it was very theoretical stuff.'

The complaint against Ulbricht describes a darker side. During one correspondence with a Silk Road user, Ulbricht tried to call out a hit on another user with whom he had a dispute.

That user, known online as FriendlyChemist, was threatening to expose the identities of thousands of Silk Road users unless Ulbricht sent him money.

'I wouldn't mind if he was executed,' Ulbricht wrote, offering personal details about his foe, including the fact that he was a married father of three, and the names of the city and province where he lived.

In a later post, Ulbricht wrote: 'He is threatening to expose the identities of thousands of my clients.'

'This kind of behavior is unforgivable to me. Especially here on Silk Road, anonymity is sacrosanct.'

During the raid, authorities seized $3.6 million worth of bitcoin, which was used instead of cash or credit cards to complete transactions on Silk Road.

The charges against Ulbricht said his website generated sales of more than 9.5 million bitcoin, roughly equivalent to $1.2 billion.

Authorities seized the currency by taking control of the digital 'wallets' Silk Road used to store bitcoin.

In a corresponding civil asset forfeiture action, prosecutors claimed Silk Road and Ulbricht were liable to the government for the value of all transactions involving drug tracking and computer hacking, as well as for money laundering penalties, and a final amount would be determined at trial.

The raid on Wednesday was not the first time the U.S. government has made arrests related to Silk Road.

Earlier this year, authorities in South Carolina arrested Eric Daniel Hughes, known on Silk Road as 'Casey Jones', and charged him in state court with drug possession. The Drug Enforcement Agency seized units of bitcoin, which Hughes allegedly used to purchase drugs from the online market.

Bitcoin, which has been around since 2008, first came under scrutiny by law enforcement officials in mid-2011 after media reports surfaced linking the digital currency to Silk Road.
