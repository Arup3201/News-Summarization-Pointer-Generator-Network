The invention of the washing machine was a revolutionary moment for women.

No longer did entire days have to be dedicated to the tedious and physically exhausting task of scrubbing the family's laundry.

However, modern washing machines are far from eco-friendly. So what's the carbon-conscious consumer to do?

If you've got a lot of energy, the ‘Laundry POD’, which requires you to physically spin the clothes yourself, could be the answer.

The Laundry Pod requires you to do the manual work by spinning your dirty washing in a drum

Grubby clothes are placed in an inner drum - makers say you can wash delicates in the POD too

You add about 1.5 gallons of water alongside a normal detergent, leave to soak, then spin

Now eco-warriors can clean a (small amount) of clothing and simultaneously feel they are doing their bit to save the planet, using what can only be described as giant salad spinner.

The concept is simple; you place your clothes (delicates can also be included) into the Laundry POD and add about 1.5 gallons of water along with a small amount of normal detergent.

You then secure the lid and leave the washing to soak for two or three minutes.

A handle pops up from the lid, allowing you to spin the drum, manually washing the clothes.

Midway through spinning you take out the drainage hose and the soapy water runs out.

You then have to repeat this process again with fresh batch of clean water to rinse the clothes, and the makers suggest that you ‘spin fast’ to ensure as much of the water as possible is drained off.

Clothes can then be hung and dried as normal.

The Laundry POD comes in white, green and silver and is available to buy online for $99.95 (about £63).

So it's a whole heap cheaper than a conventional washer/drier - and, as it's not plugged into the mains, it won't add to your electricity bills either.

Conventional washers use a lot of power 
and up to 50 gallons of water with each load, while the Laundry POD uses
 less than 5 gallons of water and no electricity.

Each wash needs less than five gallons of water, while most washing machines need around 50 gallons

The hose, stored inside the POD, allows for drainage

While it may be a stretch to imagine that men and women will embrace the Laundry POD’s hands-on washing for all their clothes, it is easy to see this revolutionising the tedium of hand-wash only items.

Getting your wool and delicate items clean can now be earth-friendly and give you an upper arm workout at the same time!
