A warning to parents has been sent out by police in Denver - where at least 200 dispensary stores are licensed to sell marijuana - about the dangers of their children accidentally eating candy that is laced with weed over Halloween.

The discerning video message is an attempt to show parents how easily a child could unknowingly ingest THC-infused treat, which have become hugely popular across Colorado since the state legalized recreational marijuana in January.

Dispensaries have been developing their own edibles, ranging from cookies to lollipops, peanut butter cups, gum, chocolate and jelly candy.

'A kid is not going to be able to tell the difference,' Denver Police spokesman Ron Hackett told ABC News.

Advice: Patrick Johnson, owner of the Urban Dispensary in Denver, explains the popularity of marijuana edibles and the difficulty in discerning it from regular candy

Throw them in the trash: Authorities have warned parents to throw away any candy that looks questionable

'My daughter is seven-years-old: She couldn't care less if it’s growing mold. She’s going to eat it.'

In the video Denver police interviewed Patrick Johnson, owner of the Urban Dispensary, to explain the difference between marijuana edibles and regular candy.

Johnson said that edibles account for somewhere between 20 and 30 percent of the gross sales in his shop.

W'hat's happening a lot with the edible manufacturers who have focused on a hard or a soft candy is that the most cost-effective way for them to bring that to the market is to use knock-off candy,' Johnson said in the video, which was posted to YouTube on Monday.

'So they'll buy it in bulk form, then they infuse it by using viscous hash oil.

'They spray that onto the candy and once that candy dries, there's really no way to tell the difference between candy that's infused and candy that's not infused.'

As a result, Johnson said that not only would parents have trouble discerning between a THC product and a regular sweet, but experts like himself would struggle too.

He warned parents to throw away anything they remotely question.

Johnson added that the safest candy to eat at Halloween is pre-packaged ones from big manufacturers such as Hershey's.

As of June 3, more than 200 marijuana dispensaries were licensed, according to The Huffington Post.
