It hasn't all been plain sailing for a couple 
who set off on a yacht to travel the world with their three-year-old, after they confessed she had turned into a 'hell child' on board.

Kim and Simon Brown gave up their jobs and home to begin a three-year tour of the world on a 56ft boat with their daughter Sienna.

But
 Kim has admitted the youngster has taken badly to life on the ocean 
wave with constant tantrums and crying during the first three months.

Setting sail: Kim Brown considered turning back from the three-year family adventure after her daughter Sienna turned into a 'hell child'

The
 39 year-old wrote on her blog: 'With so many things on my mind, I 
didn't think about whether or not my daughter Sienna would be able to 
cope with the massive change of lifestyle.

'I
 didn't think that the lack of routine, unpredictability of sailing and 
inability to have control over daily events would cause behaviour 
issues.

'I also failed to consider how she'd take to playing alone.

'Up
 until living on a boat, my daughter always had many friends to play 
with in addition to having grandad next door. She was never alone and 
never had to play by herself.'

Young adventurer: Kim admitted that some criticised her decision to take Sienna to sea while she is so young - and said there had been temper tantrums

Kim and husband Simon, 47, gave up 
their jobs last year and sold their six-bedroom home in Aylesbury, 
Buckinghamshire to fund their quest.

Simon had taught PE in a prison and Kim ran currency exchange and property businesses.

Kim had previously admitted she felt there was an air of condemnation about their decision to take their daughter to sea, with some people worrying about health and safety and potential medical problems.

They
 set off from Gibraltar in March on the first leg of their odyssey 
aboard 'Britican' and will begin by travelling the Mediterranean.

In November they plan to make the 3,000-mile crossing over the Atlantic to the Caribbean.

They plan to educate Sienna on their travels and say their boat will be well stocked with medical supplies in case of emergency.

But
 Sienna's behaviour left them considering a return to the UK until they 
found help in the form of a book on parenting which they have 
downloaded.

Family at sea: Simon was a PE teacher for under 21s at Aylesbury Prison before giving up his job to make his dreams of a round-the-world adventure come true

Kim,
 who grew up New York State, said: 'By month three into our travels and 
after peeing on the floor, spitting, punching me, kicking me, biting my 
arms (drawing blood) and smashing a plate I was at my wits' end.

'After discussing things with my cousin, we decided that the best word for her behaviour was 'defiant.'

'Every day we'd have more blow-outs, more tantrums and more tears - and Sienna wasn't the only one crying.

'I spent several days up on deck crying while Sienna was down below screaming her lungs out.'

The couple tried taking away the toddler's toys and even her favourite blanket - but her behaviour continued to get worse.

Kim
 said: 'I couldn't help but think I must be a terrible parent. I thought
 perhaps I'm not consistent enough, maybe I'm too soft or perhaps too 
hard?

'Maybe I'm not applying punishments appropriately. Then I thought it's not just me it's the situation we are in.

'At
 first, and in dramatic fashion, I thought that life on the sea wasn't 
going to work for Sienna. She just wasn't handling the transition.

'I
 felt "woe is me," and wanted to cry out that my life is finally a dream
 come true EXCEPT for the fact that my daughter has turned into a hell 
child.'

Sea legs: Sienna Brown's behaviour has improved since Kim found a parenting book online which gave useful advice

Kim said the parental advice book had helped calm things on board.

She added: 'After reading only a few chapters I immediately perceived the whole situation in a different light and went about changing my behaviour.

'Thankfully since that major bust-up that ended with my arm bleeding and a smashed plate we haven't had another explosion.

'Yes we've had crying and upsets but we haven't had any kicking, punching, biting, spitting or weeing again.'

The
 family are currently sailing through the islands of Greece and their 
progress can be tracked on a website regularly updated by Kim.

Kim added: 'This journey is also about gaining a deeper connection to my family and learning how to be the best mom I can be.'
