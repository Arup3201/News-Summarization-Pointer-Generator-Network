The report's authors found the elderly - as well as patients with cancer and heart problems who are more at risk of complications - have been 'seriously underprioritised' and 'forgotten' by the NHS

Tens of thousands of patients are dying needlessly after routine operations because they are not being properly looked after in hospitals, leading surgeons warn.

They are left 'languishing' on wards run by junior doctors rather than being moved to specialised units tended to by teams of consultants and nurses.

The Royal College of Surgeons warns that care is so poor that these patients are four times more likely to die in British hospitals compared to the U.S.

They say the elderly – as well as patients with cancer and heart problems who are more at risk of complications – have been 'seriously underprioritised' and 'forgotten' by the NHS.

The report looked at more than 50 existing studies into care of these high-risk patients in NHS hospitals who had undergone common operations on their abdomen such as cancer and hernia operations, and removal of blockages in the bowel. It did not including heart surgery.

Of the 170,000 elderly and other high-risk patients who have these procedures every year more than half - 100,000 – will suffer some complication.

And 25,000 – one in seven – will die. Many develop infections – including life-threatening blood poisoning sepsis - which is not spotted by inexperienced junior doctors.

The surgeons warn that the death-rate
 is far higher than other countries in the Western world – and four 
times more than in the US. They also say the failings are partly due to an obsession with meeting targets.

'Seriously underprioritised': The report looked at the care of high-risk patients who had undergone common operations

Managers and doctors are more 
concerned with getting patients booked into surgery within the required 
18 weeks waiting-time, rather than ensuring the most vulnerable receive 
the highest standard of care.

Norman
 Williams, President of the Royal College of Surgeons said: ‘The focus 
on reducing waiting times for elective procedures has resulted in a 
large group, of mostly elderly patients, becoming seriously under 
prioritised to the point of neglect in the some NHS hospitals.

All patients should have a clear diagnostic and monitoring plan when admitted to hospital.

Seniority of staff involved and urgency of treatment must reflect estimated risk to patient.

Each patient should have expected risk of death documented prior to surgery or other intervention.

Surgical procedures with a death risk greater than 10% should be supervised by a consultant surgeon and consultant anaesthetist.

Patients with estimated risk higher than 10% following surgery must be admitted to critical care.

Complications must be managed with an 'escalation strategy' with defined time-points and involvement of senior staff.

Resulting care plans must be routinely recorded and reviewed.

'These
 changes won’t happen on their own and we are calling on all surgeons 
and managers to work together to deliver the high quality care that 
these patients need and which some hospitals are already proving can be 
delivered.'

Mr Iain Anderson, report author and 
Consultant General Surgeon at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, said: 
'Every single emergency patient who comes through the door of an NHS 
hospital should have an individual risk assessment, diagnosis, treatment
 plan and post-operative care plan prioritised according to need.

'Instead
 we have some of the NHS’ sickest patients languishing on inappropriate 
wards, treated by juniors and with no plan in place to deal promptly 
with unexpected complications.

'These tend to be the patients who end up in intensive care units for lengthy periods of time or, sadly too sick to be helped.'

The Mail has long highlighted the poor care of those in old age as part of our Dignity for the Elderly campaign.

Michelle
 Mitchell, Charity Director of Age UK, said: 'This is just more evidence
 that the NHS is not responding to the needs of older people who 
constitute the bulk of its patients.

'It’s shocking that some of the UK’s sickest and most vulnerable men and women are not receiving the  emergency surgical and post operative care they need – care which can mean the difference between life and death.

'Improved  care and treatment  and routine risk assessments should be the right of every vulnerable patient not just those lucky enough to be  in the right hospital.'

Grandmother Jean Dawson (pictured, right) went into hospital in to have a thigh fracture fixed. But the 84-year-old died seven weeks later after losing two stones in weight.

Her daughters Julie and Lynne were appalled by her care as they watched their mother waste away at Furness Hospital, Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria.

Julie Jones, 58, who is a nurse and has two children, said: ‘She was neglected in every way.

‘She was difficult to look after because she had severe vascular dementia but that’s no excuse, she wasn’t fed or washed, it was horrendous. We felt increasing despair as she was slipping away.

'We wanted to share some quality time with her but it was spent on nagging and complaining as we tried to get the staff to look after her.’

Mrs Dawson weighed just 4st 6lb when she died in April 2009.

The family has received a ‘partial’ apology for her care.

‘I hope she didn’t know what was happening to her,’ said Mrs Jones. ‘We don’t want anyone else’s mother to go through the same ordeal.’

A spokesperson from the Department of Health said: 'We have made clear that safety must be at the heart of the NHS. It is essential that hospitals provide the safest possible care for patients.

'Hospitals should follow this guidance and monitor the quality of care they are giving to their patients and ensure that they are providing appropriate levels of services and staffing.

'We want our NHS to be truly-world class and that’s why we are modernising the health service to improve results for patients and safeguard the NHS for future generations.'
