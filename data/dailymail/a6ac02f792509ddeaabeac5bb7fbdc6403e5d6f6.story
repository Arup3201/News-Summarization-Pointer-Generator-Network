The war medals of the Normandy veteran who broke out of his care home to attend last year’s D-Day commemorations in France have sold for more than five times their estimated value.

Bernard Jordan became known as the Great Escaper after he absconded from his carers, caught a ferry to Caen and turned up in Normandy with his service awards pinned to his blazer.

His medals raised £1,650 for the RNLI at Wallis and Wallis in Lewes, East Sussex. The estimate had been £300.

Mr Jordan died aged 90 on December 30, and a week later his widow Irene passed away. The couple had no immediate family and left £600,000 to the RNLI in their will.

Mr Jordan was a 19-year-old Royal Navy lieutenant when on June 6, 1944, he was on a tank-landing craft in the first wave of boats to hit the Normandy beaches. 

He had already taken part in the Battle of the Atlantic - the cat-and-mouse conflict between Allied ships and German U-boats over the vital supply routes from Europe to the United States.

At one stage he was part of the boarding party that captured one of the Enigma coding machines, used by the Nazis to scramble messages, from an enemy submarine. 

Following the war, Mr Jordan got into local politics and served as a town councillor for 23 years in his hometown of Hove, East Sussex.

He was a a city councillor for two years and was mayor of the town from 1995 to 1996. 

Mr Jordan hit headlines in June last year when he went missing from his care home the day before the 75th anniversary D-Day celebrations. 

Without telling anyone, including his wife Irene, the plucky pensioner caught a ferry to Caen in Normandy and made his own way to the service.

Police meanwhile had launched a missing persons appeal which was only called off when Mr Jordan called home.

On his return, Mr Jordan was made an honorary alderman of Brighton and Hove and on his 90th birthday he was inundated with 2,500 cards from wellwishers around the world. 

More than 150 mourners turned out to pay their respects to Mr Jordan at a joint funeral service for him and Irene held in Brighton on January 30. 

His medals, sold after his death, comprise the 1939-1945 Star, the Atlantic Star with French and German clasp, the Italy Star, the Defence Medal and the War Medal.

A spokesman for the auction house said: 'Bernard Jordan was a wonderful chap who really embodied the great British bulldog spirit.

'He proudly served his country both during the war as a Navy officer and afterwards as a councillor. 

'Medals such as these would normally only fetch a few hundred pounds but Bernard became something of a celebrity following his Normandy adventure.'
