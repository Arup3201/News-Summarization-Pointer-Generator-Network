Lives are being put at risk because traffic authorities fail to show discretion towards drivers who try to ‘do the right thing’ by clearing a path for ‘999’ emergency vehicles, according to the AA.

Hard-line automated camera enforcement means that law-abiding drivers ‘with a conscience’ who instinctively divert into a bus-lane, move into a yellow box, or nudge forward through a red light to let an ambulance or fire-engine pass, are rewarded with a hefty fine through the letterbox.

‘Motorists who act like saints are being treated like sinners’, said the AA. ‘The bottom-line is that local authorities and firms operating bus lane cameras have been making such a killing with fines that many drivers don’t now trust enforcers to show discretion. And with good reason.’

Many motorists who fear automatic fines from camera policing won't pull over on the road to let a fire engine, police or an ambulance pass, an AA survey shows - which is threatening emergency services' response times

The AA says 'local authorities and firms operating bus lane cameras have been making a killing with fines'

As a result, the threat of automatic fines now means that one in 10 drivers would no longer divert into a bus lane to let through an ambulance, fire engine, or police car through – even if the sirens were wailing and the beacons flashing. That rises to one in six (17per cent) in London, a new AA /Populus poll reveals.

Such reluctance to move threatens emergency services response times, says the AA. But it also exposes the extent to which automated traffic enforcement cameras have removed ‘common sense and discretion’ from the rules of the road.

For the strict letter of the law is clear - no matter how much it pricks their conscience, drivers should only move into a bus lane, a yellow box junction or through a red light when specifically ‘directed to do so by a police officer in uniform.’ Otherwise they should harden their hearts, sit tight and let the emergency vehicles find their own way around them.

The boom in cameras policing bus lanes and yellow boxes means that if they obey their conscience they will be hit with a hefty automatic penalty-charge dropping through their letter box, says the AA.

A fear of fines means that one in six (13per cent) of the 18,026 AA members surveyed would not stop in a yellow box junction to allow emergency vehicles to pass, rising to nearly one in five (19per cent) in London. The capital is the only part of the UK where yellow box junctions have been enforced with cameras though this is expected to move more widely across the country.

Many UK cities fine drivers £60, reduced to £30 if paid within 14 days, for entering a bus lane. In London, the penalty charge is £130, halved to £65 for early payment. Drivers in London face the same if they stop in a yellow-box junction.

Drivers do appear more prepared to carry out riskier manoeuvres to help emergency vehicles on their way, with nearly half (48per cent) prepared to go through red lights and nearly a third (31per) prepared cent to exceed the speed limit to give them clearance, even though they lay themselves open to prosecution by the police and points on their licence, as well as a fine.

Failure to stop at a red traffic light can result in a £100 fixed penalty plus three points, the same as for speeding.

Overall, four out of ten (39per cent) say they wouldn’t worry about bus lanes, red lights, box junctions, speed limits, or pulling up on to the pavement if an emergency vehicle needed to get past.

AA president Edmund King said: ‘When it comes to emergency vehicles stuck in heavy traffic, most drivers think: ‘There but for the grace of God go we – because, the next time, that emergency vehicle could be for us’. And that is why most AA members and other drivers will risk the chance of a penalty charge to save a life.’

London is the only part of the UK where yellow box junctions have been enforced with cameras, though this is expected to move widely across the country. Traffic enforcers will 'seize on the chance to impose fines'

‘But in return too many bus lane, yellow box junction and moving traffic offence enforcers will seize the opportunity to dish out a penalty charge. Inevitably, some drivers won’t take the risk and it only takes one to block and hold up an ambulance or fire engine.’

Mr King noted: ‘The firms and councils operating enforcement cameras say that they take into account the presence of an on-call emergency vehicle before issuing a penalty notice. But in reality that is too often not the case.’

Sussex police advises on its website that motorists should ‘stay alert to approaching emergency vehicles’. It says: ‘When you hear the sirens or see flashing lights, try to locate the vehicle and consider the route that it may take. Take any appropriate action to let it pass, but be careful not to contravene any traffic signs or rules of the road.‘

It adds: ‘Remember: Emergency vehicle drivers are specially trained and have exemptions to the law that you don’t have, so you must not go through red lights or speed to allow them to pass.'

Motorists should not ‘panic or brake suddenly’, mount the kerb, or pull-over on or near to a hill, bend or narrow section of the road.

Nottingham City Council has sought to clarify their enforcement of bus lanes. It notes there are ‘a small number of reasons when it is OK to enter a bus lane. 'Principally this is ‘when directed to do so by a police officer in uniform’.

Other reasons it cites include: to avoid a collision or debris in the road; to drop off or pick up a passenger; circumstances outside the control of the driver; or to enter or exit a driveway to a roadside property.

It adds: ‘In all cases it is expected that the stay in the bus lane is as brief as possible.’

Nottingham insists that if a driver is spotted using a bus lane to ‘undertake a vehicle which turning right into a side road, then the council will ‘treat each case on its merits and try to adopt a common sense approach.’

Drivers will have 20 metres’ ‘discretionary’ driving in the lane, it said: ‘The driver of such a manoeuvre should ensure that the route back out of the bus lane is clear before undertaking. 

'In most cases the discretionary 20 metres distance will not be exceeded.’
