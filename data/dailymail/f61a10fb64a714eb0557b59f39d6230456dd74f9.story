For all the fuss of Barcelona players entering a casino, a point seemed to get missed. The odds are that it was the croupiers who ended the night exhausted and nursing an addiction.

Has there ever been such a compelling group of players as those who have played for Barcelona over the past 10 years, Catalan teams that have been so easy to look at but also so magnificently efficient in pursuit of trophies?

They tick the boxes, one by one. They play beautiful football, they win and their best players have been homegrown. When they lose, it’s a head-spinning crisis of hysteria. But they don’t lose much and that is why they are special. They have longevity.

It will be 10 years this spring since they ended their five-season La Liga drought. In that time they have won the title six times, the Copa del Rey twice and the Champions League three times.

It’s not a perfect club; they are not the wholesome organisation they were once conveyed as – witness the Neymar tax scandal and their ban from signing players in 2015 – but they are not quite the UNICEF-protected conspirators of Jose Mourinho’s imagination either.

Whatever the true morality of the club’s business, they have repeatedly produced brilliant football teams that are better to watch than any other. And now they arrive in Manchester needing to clear a hurdle. It is lost on no-one that three entire seasons have passed since their symbolic day at Wembley in 2011. It is the longest stretch the club have gone without winning the Champions League since Frank Rijkaard bought back into this tiki-taka business a decade or so ago.

The signs are that the era might be drawing to a close. That 2011 class of Messi, Xavi and Iniesta was as good as it gets. After Manchester United were demolished in the Wembley final, Sir Alex Ferguson said: ‘No one has ever given us a hiding like that.’

It's been three seasons since Barcelona were last crowned as kings of Europe - in 2011 at Wembley

Wembley was where the dream team of 1992 had won their first European Cup. Ahead of that final Pep Guardiola spent the night arguing with Andoni Zubizarreta about how many steps they would have to climb to get the trophy. The stadium, in essence, is central to their history. And the 2011 final, with seven youth-teamers in the 11, was the ideal, perfectly-executed conclusion to a narrative.

But was it the conclusion to this era? As it happens, Messi, in his battle for the ages with Cristiano Ronaldo, followed that Champions League win with his two most prolific seasons. Mind-boggling scoring figures. But three seasons have yielded only one La Liga title and one Copa del Rey. Not shabby, but not ideal. Xavi is 35 and an unused substitute in five of the past seven Barcelona games. Andres Iniesta is 30. Icons drifting away.

The test, should they get past Manchester City, is for Luis Enrique to prove he can build another great side. It will inevitably be led by Messi – Enrique will know there is little merit or job security in upsetting him (not to mention the fact he is going nowhere by virtue of Financial Fair Play) – and Neymar is of gold standard. Luis Suarez has more to prove.

Messi (centre) will undoubtedly be the catalyst if Barcelona are to dominate Europe once more

Neymar will also prove pivotal to future Barca success - especially short-term following their transfer ban

There is scope to develop another great side. But just as Spain’s time was up at the World Cup, it is natural to wonder if Barcelona’s slip from extraordinary to very good is a long-term deal. It is natural to wonder what they can do without the ability to sign players this year.

The nervousness around the club is tangible. The club won 11 games in a row and defeat against Malaga has coaxed out a few neuroses from fans. The confidence, at times, feels as sturdy as a house of cards.

Against that backdrop, who would bet against the best club of recent history now showing Manchester City that class is permanent?

Real Madrid 2 Barcelona 6, May 2009

One of the most astonishing Clasico matches of recent times. Xavi assisted four and Messi scored two (he could have had five more). Andres Iniesta described it as ‘the best Clasico of all time’ and Messi was heralded as ‘Maradona, Cruyff and Best all rolled into one’.

Barcelona 5 Real Madrid 0, November 2010

The 6-2 win was remarkable but folk of Barcelona consider this an even greater victory. And Messi didn’t even score, though it was rated one of his most complete performances. Xavi said: ‘When we got into the dressing room after the game we gave ourselves a standing ovation.’

Barcelona 3 Manchester United 1, Champions League final, May 2011

Arguably the finest moment of Barcelona’s best crop of players. Ferguson admitted that ‘no-one has ever given us a hiding like that’. Messi scored Barca’ s second and was named man of the match.

Ronaldinho goal versus Chelsea in 2005

It was a strike in a 4-2 defeat in the Champions League, but the brilliance of the moment should not be understated. With a single the flick of his boot from the edge of the area, Ronaldinho wrong-footed three Chelsea defenders and Petr Cech. They lost but it was a truly wonderful piece of skill.

Barcelona v Albacete, May 2005

It was not a big game. But it was a huge moment – Messi scored his first goal for the club. He came on as a substitute and scored a lob within 17 seconds. It was disallowed for offside so he did it again before celebrating in Ronaldinho’s arms. It made the 17-year-old the youngest scorer in Barcelona’s history and he has since gone on to break more than a few other records.
