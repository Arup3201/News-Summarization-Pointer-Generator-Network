A mom who believes her 
two-year-old was a victim of child serial killer Genene Jones has said 
she is willing to have her son’s body exhumed in a bid to convict the 
so-called Angel Of Death of his murder.

Under
an archaic Texan law to relieve overcrowding in prisons, Jones could 
legally be released from prison in February 2018 having served less than
a third of the 99 years she received in 1984.

Jones,
a pediatric nurse, was only convicted of murdering 15-month-old Chelsea
McLellan by intentionally injecting her with a paralytic drug, but she has always been suspected of killing as many as 47 other infants in a similar manner.

Marina Rodriguez is allowing her dead son Feliciano to be dug up in a bid to get a fresh conviction for Jones

Following a recent 
public outcry over her impending release, dozens of parents have come 
forward claiming that Jones was involved in the dead of their children.

A new conviction is the only course of action that would prevent the killer nurse from being released in the coming years.

One
of the parents to come forward is Marina Rodriguez, whose son, 
Feliciano was just five months old when he died at a San Antonio clinic 
in 1981.

Jones was the
nurse administering routine immunizations shots to Feliciano, but soon 
afterwards he went into cardiac arrest and died.

Rodriguez told CBS News that she is willing to have her son's body dug up and tested in an effort to ensure that the woman she believes killed her child never gets out of prison.

‘We
deserve to be heard,’ Rodriguez told Click2Houston. ‘I mean our 
children were murdered and nothing was done. Feliciano will get 
justice.’

Earlier this month Bexar County District Attorney Susan Reed pledged to re-examine all the baby deaths linked to Jones.

‘This is an individual who should never be out of prison,’ she told KENS5.com.

‘She was implicated in the deaths of 47 little babies and my goodness we cannot have someone like that free, period.’

Reed is now working with Rodriguez, to try find evidence to ensure Jones remains in prison.

‘We will do whatever it takes to keep this monster behind bars,’ said Rodriguez.

Even
though Jones was sentenced to 99 years in prison, she is scheduled to 
be released in February 2018, according to state prison records.

At
the time of her conviction Jones was sentenced under an old Texas law 
that allowed violent offenders to be given early release by 
demonstrating good behavior behind bars. The law has since been changed.

Jones only convicted of one murder in 1984 because 
the now-shuttered Bexar County hospital had shredded thousands of pounds
of records relating to the deaths of the other children, making 
prosecution of those cases difficult.

It is believed Jones killed as many as 
46 babies under her care at Bexar County Hospital while she worked there
from 1977 - 1982.

If she gets out, she will have served less than one year for every infant death she is suspected of being involved in.

Petti McClellan said: 'I need to find someone else, another family that was a victim of Genene Jones. That's the only way to keep this woman in prison. This is my mission now'

Victim's Rights Advocate Andy Kahan has spent years pushing for investigators to re-examine all the cases linked to Jones.

‘Genene
Jones will be the first serial-killer to be legally released, not just 
in the state of Texas, but across the country,’ victims' advocate Andy 
Kahan, who is working on the case, told CBS News. ‘This will be 
unprecedented.’

In July, Petti McClellan, whose daughter Chelsea was just 15-months-old when she was repeatedly injected with a lethal substance by Genene Anne Jones in 1982, made a desperate plea to find more 
victims so Jones doesn't get released from prison.

'I need to find someone else, another family that was a victim of Genene
Jones. That's the only way to keep this woman in prison. Who knows what
she can do if she gets out.

'This is my mission now. Losing a child does not consume you, it drives you,' she said.

Jones, 63, is currently being held in the Carole S. Young Medical Facility, a correctional center in Dickinson, Texas.
