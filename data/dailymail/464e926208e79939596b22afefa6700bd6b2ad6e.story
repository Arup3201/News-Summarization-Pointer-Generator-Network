EU rules on food allergens will cost British restaurants many millions of pounds, while elsewhere in Europe the new regulations will be ignored, leading chefs have warned.

Coming into effect next month, the regulations require food outlets to check on 14 ingredients that cause allergic reactions.

Schools, hospital and prison kitchens must also comply, along with hotels, restaurants, B&Bs, takeaways and suppliers.

The rule demands that every ingredient in each fresh dish served is checked for 14 specific allergens, including cereals, eggs, milk, nuts and fish.

Allergy experts hope the move will help prevent some of the ten UK allergy related deaths each year. 

But chefs fear the rules will burden the industry with £200 million in extra costs, which will have to be passed on to customers.

Italian-born chef Aldo Zilli said: ‘It’s a regulation too far. Diners know what they want and will tell us.

‘Changing the menu is hard enough, without checking which of hundreds of ingredients include one of 14 allergens.

‘In Italy, chefs are not going to like it and to be honest they won’t even be listening. 

'French chefs, even worse. But in this country, we have to comply.’

A spokesman for the Food Standards Agency said: ‘Many businesses won’t incur additional costs because they already voluntarily provide these details.’
