An international jewellery scam dubbed the 'Italian Job' has been broken up by police who stormed a luxury hotel and arrested a gang of alleged fraudsters.

Detectives believe that the men, who claim to be from Italy but are actually Eastern European, were hoping to defraud jewellery shops in the North-West of England by using fake money to buy goods.

They seized £2million worth of counterfeit euro notes, as well as £50,000 in genuine currency and a haul of watches worth around £100,000.

Haul: This fake money was seized by police investigating an alleged jewellery fraud gang on Saturday

Four alleged fraudsters had hired a whole conference room, according to the police who apprehended them at Manchester's Portland Thistle Hotel.

They were dressed in expensive Italian suits and claimed to be from Italy themselves, while they drove an Audi 8 and Alfa Romeo with German number plates.

Police arrested two of the suspects in the foyer of the hotel in front of guests and shoppers on Saturday afternoon, and the other two were arrested in the conference room.

Det Insp Rob Cousen of Greater Manchester Police said: 'We were responding to dynamic intelligence. We had only established an hour earlier they were in the Portland.

'We had previously received intelligence that a Manchester jeweller had been targeted by a gang. Those arrested have given details of who they claim to be but they had a number of ID cards.

'We believe they are probably from Eastern Europe and linked to an international organised crime gang.

'They were very sharply dressed, flash, and wore a lot jewellery. We are trying to establish if the jewellery they had was real or fake. They claimed to be Italian - a proper Italian job.

'They had hired the Denis Law conference suite, which gives an indication of their suspected plans. You don't go to that much trouble for a small fraud.

'We believe we have stopped a number of jewellery businesses from going out of business. They could have been ruined by this kind of fraud, and lost everything, their livelihoods, even their homes.'

The police had received a tip-off from Safer Gems, an organisation which monitors allegations of crime in the jewellery, fine arts and antiques trades.

It is believed that the men were hoping to bring jewellers to their hotel suite and buy gems using a mixture of real and fake cash.

Police claim that the gang entered Britain via the Channel Tunnel before travelling north of Manchester.
