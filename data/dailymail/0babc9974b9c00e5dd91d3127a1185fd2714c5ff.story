Barry McGuigan has hinted that he may be open to working with all parties as he attempts to negotiate a number of promotional issues ahead of Carl Frampton's first world-title defence – which could open the door to a showdown with Scott Quigg.

The Belfast man became only the 20th Irish fighter to claim a legitimate world professional title last Saturday night, defeating Spaniard Kiko Martinez for the IBF super-bantamweight crown in front of a 16,000-capacity crowd in his native city.

Frampton now faces a mandatory title defence against American Chris Avalos which is due to take place within 90 days, while a hand injury could impact on any plans.

The new champion is believed to have damaged his hand mid-way through his 12-round points win over Martinez.

Promotional issues are also believed to be a concern for Frampton and his backroom team.

A move back to Sky TV may be a possibility after his four-fight deal with subscription channel BoxNation expired following the win over Martinez.

‘We’re going to have a look at what’s available,’ said manager McGuigan, who insisted Team Frampton will put up a united front, despite the new champion’s eagerness to fight Quigg.

‘I think Carl takes his lead from me. Let’s be honest, I do what I think is right for him. He’s definitely done something to his hand so that’s going to keep him out for a period of time,’ continued McGuigan. ‘But I wanted him to get out again before Christmas. After a fight like that, when it looks like he cracked his hand, it might be better to let him sit out and rest.’

Frampton is keen on a showdown with British rival Quigg, but a fight with the Bury native is complicated due to the fact that he is promoted by Eddie Hearn's Matchroom, who previously promoted Frampton.

Hearn also recently struck a promotional deal with mandatory title challenger Avalos, with Frampton commenting: ‘My mate Eddie Hearn has teamed up with him. He’s like an old girlfriend who won’t go away, I don't know what he's playing at.’

Quigg, who fights this Saturday against Belgian Stephane Jamoye live on Sky, has pushed for a fight with Frampton to take place in Manchester.

Having built a temporary 16,000-seater stadium on the site of Belfast’s Titanic Quarter for Frampton’s fight with Martinez, however, McGuigan claimed he will look at a similarly ambitious promotional plan for the new champion’s future fights.

‘Oh God almighty, of course I’d do it again,’ said McGuigan on staging such an event. ‘It’s my job. And we want to produce.

‘Carl wants to fight him [Quigg], but it has to be on the right terms - we draw the crowd. He’ll box [Jamoye] next week, he’ll knock him out in a couple of rounds, and then he’ll start talking: “Oh now, I’m the one that’s most feared in the world” and all that rubbish.

‘So he alienates himself from us and makes it difficult. I end up thinking “I don’t want to do business with him”.’
