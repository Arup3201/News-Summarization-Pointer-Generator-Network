England duo Joe Hart and James Milner celebrated their recent 1-0 win against Estonia by spending the night in Aberdeen.

The Manchester City pair posed for pictures with local students on Monday as they enjoyed their time off before linking back up with their club team-mates.

Hart was issued a final warning by former boss Roberto Mancini in October 2010 when he attended a student party in St Andrews alongside Gareth Barry, Adam Johnson and Shay Given.

The 27-year-old shot stopper was also given a stern warning by then England manager Fabio Capello after he was caught dancing, singing and drinking in a bar shortly before a European qualifier against Montenegro.

Hart and Milner will both be hoping to play a part against Tottenham on Saturday afternoon.

Both players played the full 90 minutes against Aston Villa in Manchester City's last game before the international break.
