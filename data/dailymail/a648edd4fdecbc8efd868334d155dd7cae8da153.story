A man killed himself by deliberately eating leaves and berries from a poisonous tree, an inquest heard.

Colin James Kelly, 40, from Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, drove from his stepmother’s house in the Forest of Dean to the Lake District, where he died, a coroner was told.

Mr Kelly's body was found by walkers on February 24 this year, the day after he told his family he was upset about being prevented from seeing his son by the child's mother.

His stepmother, Mary Pope, gave evidence at South Lakeland Magistrates Court about the days leading up to Mr Kelly’s death.

She said: 'He came to visit on the February 17 and stayed with us until the 23rd.

'He never spoke about anything that was troubling him apart from that he was unable to see his son as the boy’s mother would not let him.

'He left on the Saturday night and I got a text from him at about ten to 11 saying that everything is sorted. I thought that meant he was back home in Hemel Hempstead.'

The inquest heard that Mr Kelly, a marble craftsman who worked cutting marble worktops for kitchens, gave his tools to his stepmother's new partner shortly before his death, saying he would no longer need them.

He left his stepmother's house on February 23 and just before 8.30am the next day, Windermere police received a call from two members of the public who had found a body in a field just off the A592, not far from the shores of Lake Windermere.

Recording a verdict of death by suicide, Coroner for South and East Cumbria, Ian Smith said: 'The pathologist gives the cause of death as poisoning... and I accept that it is not something that happens accidentally.

'Mr Kelly knew what the effects might be and knew what the outcome might be and that is also confirmed in the suicide note that was found by Mrs Pope.'
