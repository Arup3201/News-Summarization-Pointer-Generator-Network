Iron Maiden lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson has given heavy metal to millions of rock fans around the world.

Now he’s bringing thousands of tons of it to South Wales - with the launch of an aviation company.

Dickinson, a commercial airline pilot and established aviation entrepreneur, has set up Cardiff Aviation Limited, which will provide specialist services to the airline industry.

He hopes it will create around 1,000 jobs.

The business will be based at St Athan Enterprise Zone in the Vale of Glamorgan, where it has taken 132,000 square feet of hangar space.

It is expected the first clients will be announced next month, and the first Boeing 747 simulator has been purchased and is due for delivery in June.

Dickinson, whose band was the subject of the documentary film Flight 666, said: ‘We're coming into this enterprise with the knowledge we'll be bringing business to South Wales.

‘A cautious projection is that we'd expect to create up to a thousand jobs within 18 months based on the level of interest and commitment from aircraft manufacturers and operators.

‘South Wales has long had an association with the aircraft industry and I am delighted I am able to play a small part in the continuation of that tradition.’

Cardiff Aviation will be taking on the lease on the Welsh Government-owned Twin Peaks hangar to establish a maintenance repair and overhaul (MRO) operation.

As well as providing maintenance for aircraft up to Boeing 767 size, the firm will offer training packages and technical support services.

Dickinson, who has flown his band in their ‘Ed Force One’ Boeing 757 during an Iron Maiden world tour, said he was grateful to the Welsh Government for its support.

He added: ‘We've been impressed by how pro-active they've been. They've really wanted to make this happen, and we've experienced a level of enthusiasm and drive that has been a delight to behold.

‘We expect to announce the names of our first clients in May, and we're also currently dealing with expressions of interest from several more major and independent airlines.’

The 53-year songwriter also said the venture could provide a welcome boost to Cardiff Airport, which has recently seen visitor numbers drop and also drawn criticism from First Minister Carwyn Jones.

Dickinson said: ‘The added value we can bring to the package is, while the team is expert in the provision of technical services, we also have expertise in aircraft sourcing and leasing.

‘This is another key aspect to the deployment of a total aviation services package, hopefully including the development of new airline services for South Wales.

‘Cardiff Airport has tremendous potential to challenge the successful English regional airports.’

Among those welcoming today's announcement was Wales's Business Minister Edwina Hart.

She said: ‘The Welsh Government has been working closely with Bruce Dickinson and Cardiff Aviation on this exciting project for some time and we are delighted it has come to fruition.

‘This is exactly the type of investment needed, which will create hundreds of well-paid skilled jobs in one of our key sectors.

‘We have a strong, dynamic aerospace sector in Wales and this investment will build upon the skilled workforce that already exists in the area, providing a range of career opportunities.

‘This is a flagship operation and provides a great start for the new Aerospace Enterprise Zone.’

Last year, the Welsh Government confirmed it was setting up five enterprise zones in Wales, each specialising in a different sector.

St Athan will focus on aerospace and officials say it has the potential to create up to 10,000 jobs by 2025.

Its first tenant was announced in January, when classic aircraft firm Hunter Flying said it was signing a one-year lease on two hangars.
