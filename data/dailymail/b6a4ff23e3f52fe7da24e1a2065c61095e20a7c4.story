When Victoria Beckham boasted that her body was ‘completely natural’, two things immediately stood out.

One was that she seemed to be fibbing. And the other was her apparently miraculously expanding chest.

Now the former Spice Girl has admitted that she did have cosmetic surgery to enlarge her breasts. Speaking about it for the first time, she added that she then changed her mind and had the procedure reversed.

Mrs Beckham reportedly visited a London clinic to go from her natural 34A to a 34DD following the birth of her first son, Brooklyn, in 1999.

At the time she insisted her inflated look was down to support tape inside her clothes and push-up bras. She even said: ‘I’m completely natural, except for my fingernails, and I have a bit of help with my hair and a bit of a St Tropez [fake tan] going on.’

But her lawyers admitted in 2005 that she ‘had in fact undergone breast enhancement surgery’.

Now Mrs Beckham, 39, who had her fourth child, daughter Harper, in 2011, has spoken about her fake boobs. ‘I don’t have them any more,’ she told the American magazine Allure. ‘I think I may have purchased them.’

According to her biographer Andrew Morton, the initial enhancement surgery nearly 15 years ago set her back £10,000. Although she has never before publicly admitted to artificially increasing her bust size, she has confessed to cringeing at photos showing her inflated chest.

She once told an interviewer: ‘I’ve worn so many dresses in the past and when I see the photographs I think, crikey, my boobs are up round my neck again.’ She also cryptically told the British edition of Vogue magazine in 2011: ‘No torpedo bazookas. Gone.’ She declined to elaborate at the time.

In next month’s issue of Allure, the fashion designer also talks about her beauty secrets. She says she doesn’t shave her legs but instead has laser hair removal on the advice of her friend Eva Longoria, the Desperate Housewives actress.

‘It is amazing. You can go back for little touch-ups if you do see little hairs appearing,’ Mrs Beckham says. ‘But I’ve been very lucky that I haven’t had to. That was one of the best tips that Eva Longoria ever gave me.’

In the interview she is also full of praise for her footballer husband David, 38. ‘[He] is the most wonderful man I have ever met,’ she says. ‘He’s a fantastic father. He’s incredibly talented, a wonderful husband. I supported him for many years, and he’s proud of me. He supports me. We’re very equal at home.’

She sounds nostalgic for the time the family spent living in Los Angeles after her husband’s career took them there, telling the magazine: ‘Living in America for six years was the happiest I think I’ve ever been. It was much more accepting for a woman to have a career, as well as a man. And I loved it.’ But Mrs Beckham, who moved back to Britain with her family last year, is quick to add: ‘I’m not saying I’m not happy now. I’m just as happy now!’

The designer, who tells Allure that she gets up at 6am every day and runs four miles a day, is likely to be flying back to America frequently as she goes about establishing a base for her eponymous womenswear label in New York.
