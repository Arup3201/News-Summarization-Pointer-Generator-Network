A shocking photo have emerged of a bloodied brown bull mastiff with an arrow sticking out of its chest while a vet looks  at the terrible injury.

The dog, four-year-old Zeta, reportedly strayed onto the property of a New Zealand police officer who shot the dog with an arrow.

The police officer has reportedly confessed to the incident which happened in Whakatane in the eastern Bay of Plenty, 90 km east of Tauranga and 89 km north-east of Rotorua, reports Stuff.co.nz.  

This is the shocking image of four-year-old Zeta with the arrow in his chest at the vets 

Zeta's owner Jess Wallace said: 'He walked straight in the door – which we thought was weird [because he's strictly an outside dog] – and fell on the floor in front of us and the arrow was sticking out of him.' 

The incident happened last Wednesday and three days later a police officer came forward to claim responsibility.  

Miss Wallace and vet Travis Baxter who looked at Zeta were reportedly shocked to know that a police officer was responsible for the act. 

The incident happened in Whakatane in the eastern Bay of Plenty in New Zealand 

She added: 'It is not the behaviour you would expect from someone who's supposed to be an upstanding member of the community. 

'It is a bit of a shame. Whether he (the dog) was doing something he shouldn't; whether he was on their property or not – that's why the council provides the dog control service,' reports stuff.co.nz. 

New Zealand Police confirmed a criminal and employment investigation was underway. 

Vicki Barnard, Whakatane SPCA president, said it was unacceptable for anyone to shoot an animal and branded the incident 'appalling'.
