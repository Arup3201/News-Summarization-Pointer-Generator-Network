Police in Chicago are searching for three parachutists who broke into the city's Trump International Hotel and Tower, went to the roof of the nearly 1,400-foot-tall building and jumped off.

The jump must have been successful, as no injuries were reported.

Daredevils: police say these three men jumped off the top of the Trump International Hotel and Tower early Thursday morning

1389 feet: the Trump building in Chicago is one of the tallest buildings in the city

According to authorities in Chicago, the three men broke into the building, located at 401 Wabash Avenue, about 12:30 a.m. Thursday using a 'cutting device to gain entry.'

It's unclear how long the men were in the building before jumping off of it, and no items were reported stolen.

It appears authorities found out about the break-in - and the jump that followed - is because surveillance footage from inside the building showed three men walking up a stairwell towards the roof, and a witness on the ground said she saw people parachuting off the building.

Jumping from the top of a skyscraper is one of the more daring forms of B.A.S.E. jumping - which stands for buildings, antennas, spans (bridges) and earth (cliffs, etc.) - where parachutists throw themselves off of stationary objects with parachutes strapped to their backs.

Professionals: the Red Bull Air Force jumped off the same building while filming a movie

Standing 1,389 feet above the Chicago River, the Trump building is a nice feather in the cap for any B.A.S.E. jumper.

The same building was used for filming the movie Transformers: Dark of the Moon, when three members of the Red Bull Air Force jumped from the top for a scene in the sci-fi thriller.

Authorities say the incident is still under investigation. If convicted - assuming their ever found - the three men face trespassing charges.
