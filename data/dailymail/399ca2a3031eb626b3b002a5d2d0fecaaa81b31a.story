Like many a National Lottery winner before him, David Ashcroft pledged that his £12.3million jackpot would not change his life.

Now, 16 years after that lucky day, it seems he has stuck to his promise – and has spent hardly any of his winnings. 

Mr Ashcroft, 46, still works as a furniture restorer and still lives with his elderly parents in the terraced home they shared before his win.

And the only visible sign of substantial spending at the family home is new double glazing.

Mr Ashcroft has, of course, spent a little more than that – though no-one would accuse him of going mad.

A new work van has been bought as well as a caravan in North Wales and a 4x4 Mitsubishi. The car is thought to have been for his parents.

He has also dabbled in the local property market, buying a handful of homes to rent out – although the entire portfolio is worth less than £250,000, according to records at Companies House.

Jackpot: Mr Ashcrosft vowed he would not let his 12.3million win in May 2007 change him. The only frivolities he has allowed are personalized number plates

By contrast, a shrewd investor could by now have more than doubled Mr Ashcroft’s original fortune with timely investments in property. 

Perhaps the only frivolities he has allowed himself – or rather his family – are personalised number plates for his father’s van and a Ferrari, which he gave to a relative.

Following his May 1997 win – which back then was the fourth biggest in Lottery history – Mr Ashcroft admitted he had never had a girlfriend or travelled abroad, and said his only passion was fine furniture.

After leaving school aged 16, he trained as a cabinet maker and furniture restorer, and despite the huge change in his circumstances, he insisted he had everything he wanted in life.

‘I’m an ordinary, quiet introvert,’ he said at the time. ‘This may change me but I hope not.’ 

On the subject of romance, he said: ‘Any girlfriends from the past will probably come from my days in kindergarten. Miss Right may be out there. Who knows what fate may bring.’ 

And it seems Mr Ashcroft continues to resist the temptations of wealth which most of us can only dream about.

New windows: David Ashcroft has not moved from the family home he shares with his parents

Recently, he was seen tidying up outside his workshop in an unassuming suburban garage attached to a hairdressing salon, just a few minutes’ walk from his home in Liverpool.

Armed with a shovel and wheelie bin and dressed in blue jeans, a checked shirt and sensible black shoes, passers-by would hardly have guessed they were watching one of the wealthiest men in the city.

‘It’s almost as though his Lottery win never happened,’ one neighbour said. ‘Most people would have used a fortune like that to fulfil all their dreams, but evidently David’s perfectly happy as he is.’

At the family home, it is clear it has been treated to a lick of paint recently, as well as hanging baskets to smarten it up, and a satellite dish belies another little luxury.

His parents, Roy, 76, and Jean, 74, arrived at the house in their six-year-old Mitsubishi.

When asked whether her son had ever embraced a millionaire lifestyle, Mrs Ashcroft replied: ‘He’s not gone anywhere.’ 

However, she declined to discuss whether he had finally found his Miss Right.

Mr Ashcroft is not the only lottery winner to try to hold on to their old life.

Mary Jones, from Bala in North Wales, scooped £9.3million in 2004 aged 62 but carried on working as a cleaner at an activity centre.
