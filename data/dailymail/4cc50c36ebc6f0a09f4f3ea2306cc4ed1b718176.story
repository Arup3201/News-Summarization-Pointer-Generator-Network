Ryan Giggs carried on former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson's tradition by having a glass of wine with opposition bosses after matches, but jokes he opted for a can of Red Stripe instead.

Giggs took over as caretaker manager following the sacking of David Moyes last April for the final four games of the Barclays Premier League season – winning two, drawing one and losing the other.

The Old Trafford legend was a contestant for the club's Big United Quiz 2015 and answered a question about whether he kept the tradition alive: 'I did. Yes. Every one. Can of Red Stripe.'

The 41-year-old was a captain at the quiz and had rapper Tinchy Stryder and actor Andrew Whyment, better known as Kirk Sutherland from Coronation Street, on his three-man team.

Their opposition was Wayne Rooney – taking a break from captaining United and England to lead United team-mate Juan Mata and comedian Justin Moorhouse in the  quiz aired on MUTV.

There were a few awkward moments, such as when Rooney's team were asked to name which person a poll of United supporters voted for as their 'greatest-ever player'.

Rooney's team picked Eric Cantona, only for the answer to be Giggs – the man sat opposite them.

But Rooney wasn't given an easy ride, either. 

The clip of him singing with Ed Sheeran was shown in full, before host  Angus Deayton asked the 29-year-old about his ambitions outside of football.

Rooney admitted he would like to feature on X Factor some day, but that he would draw the line at I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here.

'Maybe when I've finished playing I would like to do something with X Factor,' he said. 

Other highlights included Moorhouse and Stryder trying to do keepie uppies with vegetables, and Rooney and Giggs having a race to see who could put 10 different United shirts on the fastest.

In the end Rooney's team won 20-17, but he'll be more glad this year's quiz went off without any fuss like it did in 2011.

That year Ferguson threatened his then-striker after a game of charades went sour. 

Rooney – on a team with Giggs and Jonny Evans at the time – had to act out the film Bend It Like Beckham. To do so, he swept back some imaginary golden locks before pointing to Ferguson, pretending to kick a boot then holding his eye. Sir Alex told him: 'That'll cost you.'

But Ferguson had his moments on the annual quiz, too. In January 2013, he lost his temper during another game of charades, swearing after having to explain Diego Maradona's 'Hand of God' goal.

He turned to the production team to tell them: 'You better edit that out.' They never did.
