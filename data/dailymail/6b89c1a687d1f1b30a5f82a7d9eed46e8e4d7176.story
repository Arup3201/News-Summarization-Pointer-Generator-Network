Paul Zizka's incredible work features staggering icy landscapes such as shimmering lakes, snowy mountains and vibrant auroras.

He travelled to a number of different locations worldwide including Canada, New Zealand, Niue the South Pacific and French Polynesia.

Mr Zizka, from Banff, Alberta, Canada, saw his selfies go viral early in 2014 - and has now unveiled his latest work.

He said: 'I find that sometimes including a person in a landscape scene adds to the photograph - that it conveys a different story.

'I decide then if the image might benefit from the inclusion of a human in order to convey a sense of vulnerability or belonging, or to make the image more relatable.

'It also adds the story of the photographer himself and how he relates to his subject, instead of simply standing behind the lens out of the picture.'

Paul, 35, revealed he didn't initially set out to include himself in the pictures. Instead, he wanted to depict the scale and vulnerability of certain environments - but soon found the best way to do that was to include a human element in his images.

The photographer, whose works have resulted in the book 'Summits & Starlight: The Canadian Rockies', added: 'As a landscape photographer I find the inclusion of the human element heightens the sense awe and wonder evoked by the image.'
