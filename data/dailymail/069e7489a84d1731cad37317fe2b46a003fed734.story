Real Madrid defender Alvaro Arbeloa has warned Europe's biggest clubs the Champions League holders are desperate to retain the trophy this season. 

Real clinched their 10th European Cup in dramatic fashion in May, beating city rivals Atletico Madrid 4-1 after extra-time.

Ahead of Tuesday's European Super Cup at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium against fellow Spaniards Sevilla, Arbeloa is confident his side can make it number 11 in Berlin next year.

Perfect 10: Alvaro Arbeloa celebrates winning the European Cup with Real Madrid in May

No team has won back-to-back Champions League titles since the format of the competition switched from the European Cup in 1992.  

The 31-year-old told theReal Madrid website: 'It is true that we were in search of that title for a long time. We knew what it meant, not just for the club but for our fans, and sharing that joy with them is something we will never forget. 

'Real Madrid's prestige has always been a result of its victories in Europe. For this club and for these players it is very important that we have the chance to fight for a European title and to win it.' 

Manager Carlo Ancelotti has strengthened Real's squad with the signing of World Cup top scorer James Rodriguez for £63million from Monaco to complement a mouthwatering forward line of Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema. 

World Cup winner Toni Kroos has joined for £24m from Bayern Munich and Costa Rica goalkeeper Keylor Navas has also arrived from Levante for a fee of £10m, leaving Real well-placed to challenge on all fronts in 2014-15.

Spain defender Arbeloa says claiming the elusive 'Decima' - Real's 10th European Cup - is the highlight of his career.

The former Liverpool full back said: 'When you win the Champions League with Madrid it is the pinnacle for a player and hopefully we can repeat it in the future.

'We won two titles including the coveted Decima. We have to be quite happy with that after the arrival of Ancelotti and a number of new players. 

'It's very difficult to win a Champions League. We have to maintain high standards. 

'But Real Madrid always has to be up there.'
