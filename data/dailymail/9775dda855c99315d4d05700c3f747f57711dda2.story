Jamie Oliver has revealed he was asked to play a part in The Hobbit movie in exchange for cooking a meal for the director's 50th birthday

Jamie Oliver has revealed he turned down a chance to play a hobbit in the movie adaptation of the book by JRR Tolkien.

The TV chef said he was asked to cook at director Peter Jackson's 50th birthday during filming three years ago, and in exchange he was offered a part. 

He had to turn it down due to work commitments – although he confessed he was tempted by the idea of taking the costume home to impress wife Jools. 

Oliver spoke about the missed opportunity while filming the new series of Jamie And Jimmy's Friday Night Feast, which he presents with farmer and broadcaster Jimmy Doherty. 

While chatting with guest Kate Hudson about parts she has missed out on, Oliver explained: 'The worst thing that happened to me was that I got phoned up by the exec producer and asked did I want to go and cook for Peter Jackson's birthday, the big birthday.

'And if I did, they would fly me over and I could be a hobbit in the film. But I was working, I couldn't get out of it. 

'I really wanted to do it, I would have got right into it as well, I would have taken the costume home and said "Jools, let's make love!".'

The first edition of the six-part series - filmed in a pop-up cafe on Southend pier - is to be screened on January 2. 

Other guests in later weeks include Hugh Bonneville, Ellie Goulding, Tinie Tempah, Michael Sheen and Paloma Faith.
