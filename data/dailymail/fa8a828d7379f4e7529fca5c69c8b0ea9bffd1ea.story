Fatal crashes in which mobile phone use has played a part have risen by nearly a third in one year – as users do not fear getting caught, a report reveals today.

The AA warns that drivers who use mobile phones are at ‘epidemic’ proportions – and the rising number is frustrating the law-abiding motorists who see others ‘getting away with it’.

The motoring organisation has found that one in ten of all motorists have been so annoyed about seeing another driver using their mobile phone at the wheel they have beeped their horn, flashed their lights, gestured or shouted at them.

But the latest figures from the Department of Transport show they may be fighting a losing battle.

The number of fatal accidents in which a driver using a mobile was a contributory factor increased from 17 in 2012 to 22 in 2013 – a rise of 29 per cent. Meanwhile, all accidents in which phone use played a part rose from 378 to 422 – up 10 per cent.

It is currently legal to use a mobile while driving – but only if you use a hands-free device. If you are caught holding your phone, you face three points on your licence and a fine of up to £1,000.

Jim Kirkwood, of AA DriveTech, a driver education service, said: ‘The use of hand-held mobile phones is an epidemic among drivers who appear to be addicted to using their phone whenever and wherever they please.

‘Drivers who use their hand-held phones are at best risking points, a fine or attending an educational course, but at worst they are risking death and serious injury.' 

People use their mobile phones for a whole range of functions and the latest figures suggest the Department of Transport may be fighting a losing battle 

RAC technical director David Bizley said: ‘Mobile phone use has been a problem for some time and there’s not been enough action to tackle it.

‘Using a hand-held phone or texting while driving must be made socially unacceptable.’

AA spokesman Paul Watters said: ’The last thing we want to see on our roads are mobile phone vigilantes taking the law into their own hands.

‘But motorists are becoming increasingly frustrated that the law appears not to be being enforced.'
