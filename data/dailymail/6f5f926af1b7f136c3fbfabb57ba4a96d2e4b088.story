Ed Miliband’s hopes of winning the General Election were fading last night after his leadership came under heavy fire from his own party.

The embattled Labour leader faced a new crisis as the party’s biggest private donor joined the withering attacks on his NHS policies.

And Mr Miliband was described as looking ‘haunted’ because he knew that his party was on course to lose the Election, according to the editor of Britain’s leading Labour-supporting magazine.

Missing the point: Ed Miliband’s speech on the NHS last week failed to stop Labour’s electoral rot

The twin blows came as Labour MPs privately admitted they feared Miliband’s Election campaign was in danger of collapsing. His credibility was further eroded as it was revealed that:

The new pressure on Miliband over his controversial vow to reverse Coalition NHS reforms came from millionaire businessman John Mills, the brother-in-law of former Minister Tessa Jowell. Mr Mills backed the attack on the policy made by former Labour Cabinet Minister Alan Milburn last week, exposing rifts within the party.

The tycoon said Labour was wrong to decry the increasing involvement of the private sector in the NHS, adding: ‘I agree with Milburn – if you look at the Continental model, they have a much greater mix of public and private provision.’ 

Mr Mills, the chairman of consumer goods giant JML, gave Labour £1.65million in 2013. He also condemned Mr Miliband’s plan to use a mansion tax to provide much of the extra £2.5billion a year he plans to inject into the NHS.

‘I am not convinced of the case for a tax on expensive properties,’ he told The Mail on Sunday.

‘And it certainly should not be hypothecated for the NHS. It would be much better to introduce extra council tax bands and spend the money on local needs, such as affordable housing.’

Miliband faced another devastating critique from Jason Cowley, editor of the Left-leaning New Statesman magazine, who said Labour knew it was heading for defeat in May – but had no idea how to stop the rot.

Writing in today’s Mail on Sunday, Mr Cowley says Miliband is at war with his campaign chief Douglas Alexander, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has ‘all but given up’ on the party leader, and Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham is busy promoting his own leadership ambitions.

The mood of Labour MPs is ‘not so much one of despair, it’s worse than that – resignation,’ says Mr Cowley.

Labour appeared to be ‘willing itself to defeat. The party knows it is losing an Election that it should be winning, and doesn’t know what to do about it.’

Mr Cowley says ‘haunted’ Miliband has ‘grown distrustful of colleagues’ adding: ‘There are splits over strategy between Miliband and Alexander, and between Miliband and Balls. Balls has “all but given up on Miliband,” I was told by a friend of the Shadow Chancellor.’

Mr Cowley says Miliband is ‘decent and intelligent’ and could yet scrape home with more seats than the Tories – though not achieve an overall majority – but only thanks to Britain’s voting system which favours Labour.

A measure of the anxiety in Miliband’s inner circle is the claim that they have already discussed how to prop up his leadership in the event of defeat on polling day, in a series of so-called ‘war gaming’ sessions.

‘A group of Ed’s advisers have talked through what to do if they wake up on May 8 and Cameron is still PM,’ said an insider. 

‘They know Ed’s Shadow Cabinet enemies are waiting to strike and their plan is to buy time by arguing that Cameron will be in a very weak position if he fails to win an outright majority. Ed’s people will say that Cameron may be unable to form a new Coalition and there could be a second Election very soon.

‘If that happens, they will say that Labour needs stability, not a divisive leadership contest lasting months, and that Ed would provide that stability.’

Further signs of Miliband’s embattled position emerged from reports of an Election ‘pep talk’ he delivered to Shadow Ministers. According to one witness, he said: ‘I know they will be coming for me and I am ready for it.

Even the liberal BBC appears to be losing the faith. 

First, on Tuesday’s Newsnight, Kirsty Wark skewered Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham over his NHS policy. 

Then on yesterday’s Today programme on Radio 4, James Naughtie, who once used the term ‘we’ on air to describe Labour, repeatedly likened Mr Miliband’s efforts to the party’s doomed 1992 campaign during a challenging interview with Roy Hattersley. 

’Some thought he was referring to growing attacks on him by former Ministers such as Milburn, who served in Tony Blair’s Government and backed David Miliband in the 2010 Labour leadership contest.

A source close to Miliband said: ‘He is very angry at the number of Labour politicians who are prepared to criticise him publicly.’

One senior Labour MP pointed the finger of blame at Lord Mandelson, who enraged Miliband by criticising the mansion tax. ‘The sniping against Ed [Miliband] has all the hallmarks of a Mandy campaign,’ said the MP. 

‘Ed despises him for what he said on the mansion tax. Mandelson cannot get over the fact that Ed has turned his back on his precious New Labour project.’

Friends of Mandelson said it was ‘nonsense’ to suggest he was behind a campaign to undermine Miliband.

One MP, a long-standing ally of Miliband, said: ‘You sometimes wonder whether these Blairites actually want us to win the Election. Maybe they would rather Ed loses so they can say “We told you so” and replace him with another Blairite.’

Ed Miliband became a laughing stock when his clumsy attempts to eat a bacon butty slavered in ketchup were captured on camera.

And it appears that his Shadow Chancellor isn’t quite prepared to forget the embarrassing incident. 

Yesterday Ed Balls tweeted the ‘bliss’ of finding a ‘cafe which does proper bacon sandwiches’ after two hours of canvassing Yorkshire.

His post triggered a tsunami of sarcastic comments, including, ‘Can you eat it without looking like an alien????’ and ‘You aren’t giving the other Ed lessons in eating a bacon sandwich are you?’

In the end, Mr Balls joined in, pointedly revealing he had ordered ‘bacon on a big bap, no sauce…’
