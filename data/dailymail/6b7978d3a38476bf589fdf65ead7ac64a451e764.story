Rio Ferdinand has labelled the FA 'ludicrous' after his three-match ban for using the word 'sket' - slang for a promiscuous female - on Twitter.

The QPR defender tweeted on Friday: 'Is humour even allowed....I'm baffled! Ludicrous.... & I don't mean the rapper' before replying 'preach' to a user who said: 'I can see that he FA have operated a double standard here. They have not prosecuted Mackay & Moody & Referee Elray for using....'

Former Cardiff duo Malkay Mackay and Iain Moody are not expected to be charged over their exchange of sexist, racist and homophobic texts and emails. While David Elleray was ordered to take an equality and diversity training course after making racist comments to another official.

Ferdinand's 'preach' comment indicates that he agrees that the FA have dealt him a harsh punishment compared to other similar offences. 

The 35-year-old is furious at his treatment by the FA - who found him guilty of misconduct for abusing another user of the social media platform on September 30 - and may withdraw his support from future FA initiatives.

After sending the tweet on Friday, Ferdinand was quickly backed-up by his QPR team-mate Joey Barton on Twitter.

The midfielder wrote: 'Can I say 'wet wipe' without getting a 83 game ban or a £14,000,000 fine?

'Wonder what words I can use? #nonoffensiveretorts

'Surely a person has the right to be offensive? Especially if someone offends you? Shambolic that @rioferdy5 misses 3 games and loses £25k.

Joey Barton took to Twitter to support his team-mate Ferdinand, describing his ban as 'an absolute disgrace'

'I understand the need to reprimand him. He's a human being who has reacted to some unfair criticism.

'But the punishment isn't fitting of the crime in my opinion. 3 games is violent conduct. Terry only got 4 games for racial abuse?

'3 games and £25k for a tweet? Come on.'

The pair then began their own conversation on the social media site, with Barton describing the punishment given to Ferdinand as 'an absolute disgrace'.

Ferdinand began by writing to Barton: '@Joey7Barton its a Tepid tweet....3games im not even going to hashtag it!!'

The former Manchester City man replied: '@rioferdy5 I have said way worse I am sure. Don't understand how you can be banned from football. It's nothing to do with it.

'It's an absolute disgrace. They have set a dangerous precedent now. Looking forward to seeing them police this? #muppets'

Barton has called for the FA to clarify their rules on offensive language used on social media

Barton didn't hold back on Twitter, sarcastically questioning whether he could expect a ban from the FA

Barton then called on the FA to clarify their rules regarding offensive language on social media, adding: 'Can someone from the @FA send me a list of offensive, ban incurring words that I can't use online and the requisite bans attached to each.'

Ferdinand also received support from Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker, who tweeted: 'Must say I think the @rioferdy5 3 game ban is ridiculously harsh. A little warning would have sufficed, surely.'

Some people in football believe Ferdinand is the victim of a witch-hunt. 

Ferdinand was a member of FA chairman Greg Dyke's commission that was set up to safeguard the future of the national game and has previously stated a desire to become England manager one day.

That is all in jeopardy after the FA commission banned him for three games, fined him £25,000 and ordered the former England defender to attend an education programme.

Although Ferdinand accepts that his response on social media to a tweet about his performances in a QPR shirt was inappropriate, other players have escaped FA scrutiny.

Five days ago Barton accused Barcelona forward Neymar of being 'Messi's fluffer' on Twitter.

A 'fluffer' is a slang term used in the adult entertainment industry, but the FA's disciplinary team have yet to call the midfielder to account.

Ferdinand is active on social media, with 5.9million followers on his Twitter page and over 14,500 tweets

Harry Redknapp criticised Ferdinand's ban and believes footballers would be better off without Twitter

Barton also claimed that Oscar Pistorius 'definitely intended to kill her (Reeva Steenkamp)' in yet another outburst that has escaped FA punishment.

Ferdinand, who is scheduled to miss QPR's games against Chelsea, Manchester City and Newcastle, is still considering whether to appeal against the verdict.

His manager Harry Redknapp criticised Ferdinand's ban, which was at the same level as a red card for a two-footed tackle.

Redknapp said: 'The same as a two-footed challenge? No. If someone slags him off and he goes back and slags them off. It doesn't equate. I genuinely don't know what goes on on Twitter. It would save all the hassle if no-one was on Twitter.'
