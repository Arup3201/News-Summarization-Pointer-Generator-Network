Wolverine impersonator: James Lockless, 50, who died after wrapping himself in cling film and a red nylon sheet

A superhero impersonator died after wrapping himself in three rolls of cling film and a red nylon sheet in a bizarre solo sex game which went wrong, an inquest heard.

James Lockless, 50, was discovered dead in his flat when police officers broke the door down after his friends and neighbours realised he was missing.

The officers found him dead in a dark room near three rolls of cling film and a weight-lifting bench in the property in Carshalton, Surrey.

Police officers initially thought the karate teacher and impersonator of the Marvel Comics character Wolverine may have been murdered.

When other officers arrived and cut the sheet off the 
body, they found cling film wrapped tightly around various parts of his 
body including his neck and ankles.

A post-mortem examination revealed he had died from autoerotic asphyxia, a coroner, sitting in Croydon, heard.

The alarm was raised when he failed to turn up for a karate lesson and his body was found.

Police found the body lying on its left hand side bound from head to toe in red nylon on the floor.

The officers had to cut three rolls of cling film attached to his body. It was around his ankles and other places including his neck.

In returning a verdict of misadventure, Coroner Dr Roy Palmer, said: 'He managed to do what he did entirely on his own'.

Mr Lockless ran Sutton Martial Arts 
Centre at Sutton Grammar School. He began teaching karate after 
launching the centre, with his father, Syd, in the 1980s.

The sixth dan black belt had also worked as a lookalike of Marvel Comics superhero Wolverine.

Tragically for the family, Syd died last Friday, aged 78, of a suspected heart attack.

In its heyday up to 500 children and adults would learn at the centre each week.

Mr Lockless was also well-known as a doorman in Sutton who had worked at Chicago's and Revolutions nightclubs.

His brother, Dave Lockless, said: 'He was very friendly and always looked for the good in everyone.

'He was an easy-to-get-on-with character.'

He said his family had been devastated by the double tragedy of losing his brother and his dad within days of each other.

A police spokesman said: 'Police were called at 3.30pm on Saturday, February 11, following reports of a missing person.

'Officers attended an address at Devonshire Road, Carshalton, and found the body of a man.

'London Ambulance Service was called and the male was pronounced dead at the scene.'

It is unclear how long Mr Lockless had been lying dead, although officers found a local newspaper on the doormat from three days beforehand.
