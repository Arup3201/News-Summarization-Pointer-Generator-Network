British tourists are turning their backs on Kenya because of the threat of terrorism.

Militants linked to Al Qaeda carried out two massacres in villages close to a holiday island this week, claiming more than 60 lives.

Terror group Al Shabab, which has carried out a series of recent bomb attacks, warned: ‘Kenya is now officially a war zone and any tourists visiting the country do so at their own peril.’

Some tour operators, including Thomson, stopped sending travellers to Kenya in May after the first of the bombings.

In a normal year, more than 180,000 Britons would travel to the East African country for its beaches, safaris and wildlife.

But visitor numbers have plummeted – with up to 80 per cent of hotel rooms reportedly empty in Mombasa, the country’s second-largest city after the capital, Nairobi.

Kenya’s tourist board in London has tried to play down the threats. It confirmed that gunmen had raided Majembeni village, a rural farming community about ten miles from Kenya’s coast and 40 miles south of Mokowe, where many holidaymakers take a boat to Lamu, a popular tourist spot.

But a spokesman said: ‘Majembeni village has no international tourist facilities and no tourists were involved in the incident.

‘Lamu Island, one of Kenya’s primary tourist resorts, is in no way affected by this attack and neither is any other part of the Kenya coast. The majority of visitors travelling to Lamu arrive by air into the local airport.’

Somali group Al Shabab confirmed it had carried out the latest attack, telling Reuters that its ‘operations in Kenya will continue’ in response to the presence of Kenyan troops in Somalia and the killing of Muslims.

Spokesman Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab said it had raided villages around Mpeketoni, and he claimed most of those who were killed while watching a World Cup match in a hotel were police officers and wildlife wardens.

Thomson said all outbound flights up to October 31 have been cancelled and anyone with a booking should contact the company.

A spokesman added: ‘Customers will be able to amend their booking to an alternative holiday, any on sale season for either long haul or short haul destinations, as long as the holiday is booked by the end of June.

‘If the cost is less than their original holiday, they will be refunded the difference. 

‘If it’s more expensive we will pay £50 per person towards the extra cost as a gesture of goodwill.

‘If we are unable to secure an alternative holiday, then a full refund will be offered.’

A spokesman for rival operator Thomas Cook said: ‘We monitor travel advice closely and are contacting the small number of customers with forward bookings to the affected areas that are travelling over the next few weeks to discuss their options. We will liaise with our experienced overseas team and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and update on changes in advice.’
