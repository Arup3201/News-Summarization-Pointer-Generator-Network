Dressed in black from head to toe, and wearing a flowing robe, this is the first image seen in years of the world’s most wanted man, whose terrorist group has butchered thousands and stolen more than a billion pounds in gold and cash.

Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the elusive leader of the Al Qaeda splinter group Islamic State of Iraq and Sham (Isis), walked out of the shadows and delivered a sermon at the Great Mosque in Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city.

He addressed the packed congregation – which included  Isis fighters and local sympathisers – on the first Friday of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, in the heart of a city  his fighters took control of barely a month ago.

The man thought to be ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, aka Caliph Ibrahim, adresses Muslim at a mosque in the militant-held northern Iraqi city of Mosul

His sermon came only days after he 
declared himself caliph, or ruler, of the world’s 1.2  billion Muslims. 
He also declared large swathes of northern Syria and  Iraq seized by his
 fighters as his new caliphate.

A video of Baghdadi’s sermon was released on the internet yesterday and went viral instantly on jihadist forums and websites.

Speaking from the pulpit of the 
mosque, Baghdadi, 42, urged the world’s Muslims to flock to the new 
Islamic caliphate. He praised the victory of his 14,000 fighters spread 
across Iraq and Syria.

The speech was an audacious move for a
 man who has a £6 million bounty on his head and who would be a target 
of attacks by drones or US forces.

Until yesterday, there were only two 
known images of Baghdadi. They were at least four years old and taken by
 US soldiers when he was in detention in Iraq.

'The mujahedeen have been rewarded victory by God after years of jihad, and they were able to achieve their aim and hurried to announce the caliphate and choose the Imam,' says al-Baghdadi

During the appearance by al-Baghdadi the mobile signal was blocked in and around the area of Mosul and remained blocked for several hours

Al-Baghdadi cleaned his teeth with a miswak, the dental stick used by the Prophet, before he spoke to worshippers in the mosque

When he became leader of Isis in 2010,
 he forbade any images or videos of him being issued, and experts have 
said that he even met some of his closest aides with his face covered, 
fearing spies.

Until he delivered his Friday sermon, 
intelligence experts were not even sure which country he was in, some 
claiming he was in Syria, while others said he may have been in Iraq.

Raffaello Pantucci, a security expert 
at the think-tank RUSI, said: ‘The video is emblematic of the confidence
 that Baghdadi and Isis feel about themselves.

‘They have consolidated a large part of Syria and Iraq into what they call a caliphate, and he is asserting his leadership.’

Last month Isis began an onslaught in northern Iraq,  taking over Mosul and Tikrit, Saddam Hussein’s birthplace.

They executed hundreds of soldiers, and raided the city’s  bank of cash and gold bullion.

They boast 11,000 fighters in Iraq and Syria and 3,000 foreign jihadis, including 500 Britons.

Last night, the Iraqi government issued a statement casting doubt that the video Isis issued was  of Baghdadi.

Iraq’s interior ministry spokesman, Saad Maan, said: ‘We have analysed the footage, and found it a farce.’

The Iraqi government claims  Baghdadi was injured in an air strike earlier in the week.
