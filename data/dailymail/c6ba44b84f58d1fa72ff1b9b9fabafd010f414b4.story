When Kyle and Josh Brooks wowed the X Factor judges on Saturday night they were quick to thank the secret to their level-headed success, their grandmother.

The twins from South Wales impressed the judging panel with their rendition of Westlife's Us Against the World and gained themselves four 'yes' votes from the judges.

However, the 15 year olds say that they will not let their potential fame go to their head thanks to their moral upbringing from their Nan.

Colette Brooks, 59, became the boys legal guardian when they were just 18-months-old and the twins say that it was her moral upbringing that has guided them to success.

Kyle and Josh who are studying for their GCSEs at Stanwell Comprehensive School in Penarth, described their Nan as their inspiration.

Teenager Josh says that along with the judges their grandmother is who they want to impress the most.

'We want to make Nan proud because she's given up her life for us. We look up to her as our role model.

'She's our world. We want to give something back to make her happy.'

The boys are well aware of the sacrifices their Nan has made for them giving up her career and moving into a bigger house in Cardiff to devote her time to their upbringing.

Colette admits that at first it wasn't easy but they got through the hard times thanks to the local community. 

'It was difficult at the beginning. But we made a lot of friends in Grangetown, which is where we were living at the time.

The boys have always shown a keen interest in Christianity and encouraged their Nan to join them in church

'We joined the local mother and toddler group and they accepted us even though I was old enough to be some of the mothers' mother.'

Both boys have religious beliefs and Colette says it was they who encouraged her to go to church after being invited to a barbecue at Cornwall Street Baptist Church, in Grangetown.

Although she had become disillusioned with religion Colette said she was impressed by the resident pastor in the church and his wife. 

'We were all baptised in the church. I have not pushed them into going to church - they have chosen that path themselves. But their faith has been a very good grounding for them.'

The grandmother says that it was this interest in religion that first sparked the boys singing career.  

'Before long Pam suggested that the boys sing a duet in church. I agreed and found that they had really good voices and their singing was appreciated by the congregation.

'I have encouraged them in what they have wanted to do. JA has also been good for them since they haven't really had a male role model. 

Colette says she is thrilled to be such an inspiration to the twins.

'It lovely to think that I am their role model. For them to be given this chance is absolutely unbelievable. They have had no professional training having just sung in church and in their bedrooms.'

Colette added that she is confident that the boys recent brush with fame will not change their moral and religious beliefs.

'They have a marvelous opportunity to show how much talent they have got. I have no worries about how any of this will affect them.'
