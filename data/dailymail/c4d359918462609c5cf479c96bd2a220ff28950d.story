An easyJet flight carrying TOWIE cast members and their luggage was grounded because it was too heavy to take off.

The plane flying from Southend to Malaga, Spain, on Saturday was delayed after it was not allowed to take off due to carrying 200kgs of extra weight.

Cast members Arg, Ricky Rayment, Lauren Pope, Grace Andrews, Fran Parman, Bobby Cole Norris and Jasmin Walia were all on board the flight, heading to Marbella for a 10-day trip being filmed for a summer special of the ITV2 series.

The captain made an announcement to passengers, explaining that the flight was overweight and couldn't take off, asking for four people to leave the flight and transfer to Luton to catch another plane.

He added they would be put into a taxi and given £100 each, and added: 'I'm not taking off unless people do it.'

After 30 minutes, four women finally volunteered, with a flight attendant adding: 'In 20 years, we have never had an incident where this has happened before.

'But then, we've never had TOWIE on board before.'

Bobby Cole-Norris, told heat magazine: 'We were at Southend runway when the pilot came out of the cockpit - and when he does that you know there's something to worry about. 

'He got on the walkie talkie to say 'we're 200kg over, four people have got to get off and be put in a cab to Luton, there's a flight tonight we'll give you £100 each but obviously no one dare do it so after about 20 minutes he was like "I'm not taking off unless people do it".'

TOWIE's Jasmin Walia added: "There was no way we were doing it for £100 it's such an inconvenience.'

Jasmin reportedly packed three suitcases and Bobby was 4kg over with his luggage allowance - which he claimed was down to hairspray.

A spokesman for easyJet said: 'Like all airlines, easyJet’s flights have weight restrictions based on a number of different variables for safety reasons. 

'In the event that a flight does exceed its weight limit, we ask for passengers to volunteer to transfer to another flight which is what happened on this occasion.

'The safety and welfare of our passengers and crew is always easyJet’s highest priority.'
