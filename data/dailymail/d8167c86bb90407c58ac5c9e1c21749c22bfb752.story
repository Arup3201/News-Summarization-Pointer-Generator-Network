More than 30 hospital trusts have amassed debts totalling £300million, it has emerged.

The amount of taxpayers’ money being used to bail out stricken hospitals has trebled in the past year.

Only last week it was announced South London Healthcare was being put into special measures as it is on the brink of going bust.

Today a report by the National Audit Office warns it and another 30 trusts are in the red, with total debts of £307million.

The Government blames much of the debt on controversial private finance initiative deals, which were expanded under Labour.

The NAO warned that the Government cannot afford to carry on bailing out the trusts.

There are also concerns that the hospitals’ dire financial situation will lead to worsening patient care.

Last year £253million of public money was given to failing hospitals to help them cover everyday running costs – more than treble the £76million spent the previous year. Next year the bailout bill is likely to rise to £300million.

Margaret Hodge MP, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee said: ‘It is shocking that over the past year alone the amount the Department for Health has had to spend on bailing out trusts in financial difficulty rose by 333 per cent.

‘Trusts in particular received significant support; South London Healthcare NHS Trust and Barking and Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust.’

The Government blames much of the debt on botched PFI deals which were encouraged by the Labour government.

These enabled private firms to pay up front for a new cancer ward or maternity department, for example, and the trust would then pay them back in yearly instalments.

But this amount goes up with interest every year and trusts also have to spend large amounts of money maintaining the buildings so they are ‘new’.

As such, many have been unable to make these repayments.

The NAO warns that in future, the NHS will not be able to afford to continue bailing these trusts out.

It points out that there is unlikely to be any increase in Government spending on the NHS - once inflation is taken into account - for at least the next three years.

The future of South London Healthcare trust is uncertain but health secretary Andrew Lansley is likely to make a decision later this year.

It covers three hospitals - Princess Royal University Hospital in Orpington and Queen Mary’s Hospital in Sidcup in Kent and the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich, South London - and any may be closed-down.
