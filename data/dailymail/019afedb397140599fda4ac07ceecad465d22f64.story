It's widely touted as Topshop's younger, more purse-friendly sister, but Miss Selfridge is giving the high street mecca a run for its money with its latest collection.

For the festive season, the design team at Miss Selfridge have created a premium collection of limited edition dresses and thanks to their dazzling sparkles and sequins, they're perfect for the Christmas party season.

Creative Director Yasmin Yusuf has scoured the world’s vintage markets and delved into the brand’s archive to inspire the collection.

Amping up the glamour: Miss Selfridge has unveiled its glossy new collection of sparkly eveningwear (dress, £150)

The result? A vintage inspired collection of glamorous dresses embellished with plenty of sparkle.

The range was inspired by prohibition era flapper dresses and couture gowns - think modern day Bugsy Malone.

Glitz and glamour: The design team travelled around the world looking for inspiration and created a range of gowns similar to those seen in Bugsy Malone (maxi dress, £150)

Silhouettes range from 60s shifts to fishtail maxis, and dresses - both long and short - come with an on-trend scallop edge embellishment in pastel pinks and berry hues.

Speaking about the range, which costs between £65-£200, a spokesperson for the brand said: 'Styled with a biker jacket for a rock edge or with chic classic accessories, these pieces will take you through the party season seamlessly.'

Fans of the Arcadia brand, owned by Sir Philip Green, include The Saturdays, Sam Faiers and Millie Mackintosh.
