Big brown eyes, a wagging tail – and a nose so keen it strikes fear into drug smugglers far and wide.Megan, the most successful sniffer dog ever, has capped off her career with her 100th find.

Now, after detecting £30million of cocaine – some 220kg (485lb) – in seven years on the job, the record-breaking springer spaniel is getting ready to retire.

Border Force Springer Spaniel Megan, 8, who is based at Gatwick Airport, is the most successful drug detection dog ever

Only months from retirement, this week she made her 100th find – more than any other dog. 

On the streets, the 220kg cocaine she detected would have a street value of more than £30million.

Her handlers say the secret of her success is her unusually large nose and long muzzle.

Alan Thorpe, Dog Unit Team Leader said: ‘She is by far the most successful drugs sniffer dog ever. Getting 100 finds is an amazing achievement, and it’s never been done before.’

Megan’s handler is Steven Martin, 29, from Sidcup. She lives with 12 other dogs at a top secret location near Gatwick Airport.

Away from work she is, he says, a sensitive dog, with a gentle personality. But when he puts her harness on, she is transformed.

It is, Steve says, a ‘superhero-type thing’.

‘When she is out and about here being her normal self she can be quite sensitive.  But when she’s working she is indestructible.

‘When she wants to find the drugs, there’s nothing that will get in her way. Once she puts her harness on she has these powers and she goes off and does what she has to do.’

When she finds the scent, Megan will indicate at the strongest point of smell with a ‘freeze stare’, focused on it with her eyes and nose.

Such is her sense of smell, she can even smell cocaine dissolved inside another liquid in a bottle, or the sweat of cocaine on the hands and feet of smugglers who have swallowed – or otherwise deposited the drugs inside their body.

Mystery surrounds her birth and origins – she came from the Metropolitan Police but before that it is unclear.

Her relationship with Steve did not get off to the most auspicious of starts.

‘She rolled over and weed on me,’ he said. But from that point on, they’ve never looked back.

In their first year, sniffer dogs in training are not expected to make even one find; Megan made ten. Since then, she’s broken every record going.

Megan was a protégée of the now retired Badger, another Springer Spaniel, who retired in 2007. A picture of Badger hangs in the headquarters of the sniffer dogs near Gatwick Airport.

Its inscription reads: Badger: ‘A Gatwick Legend’ 2001-2007. He made 82 finds.

The sniffer dog base is in a secret location, unmarked from the road, and hidden from view by trees. Security is taken seriously: some years ago the name of a dog – now retired – was found by the FBI at the home of a notorious drug baron in South America.

The animal – which has not been identified – had been put on a hit list, and had a price on its head, because it had intercepted a particularly large consignment of drugs.

And a few months ago there was a scare when a dog died. There were fears an organised crime gang operating in the airport might have slipped the dog a poisoned biscuit.

A full investigation was carried out and suspicions were allayed – the animal died of intestinal problems and hadn’t been poisoned.

At the base the dogs live in relative luxury – under overhead lamps and heat reflective floors.

In the pack, Megan isn’t the top dog, Steve says, but doesn’t get in to scraps. ‘Everyone gets on with Megan – she is very popular,’ he says. 

For six months she went off the boil – and Steve was worried she might be slowing down because of her age.

But after a visit to the dentist she bounced back to life. The problem had been a rotting tooth giving her toothache.

Now coming to the end of her working life, you would expect her work ethic to have eased off. But not a bit of it, Steve says. The only day she allows herself a lie-in, he says, is when she’s not working.

‘Even at eight she is really active, a real pro. She wakes up in the morning with the rest, but if she sees it’s not me then she will go back to bed.’

Around the airport, Megan is something of a celebrity – having appeared on a series of documentaries set in and around the airport.

‘People are always recognising her,’ says Steve. I just drive her around now and let her get on with the job. People say I’m just her driver.’

He admits that, when her last day comes – expected to be within months – it will be an emotional day.

‘To see her be so successful, to go after seven years, it’s going to be a bit upsetting,’ he says. ‘She has done me proud’. ‘It’s going to be a tough transition’.

‘She’s doing it for herself but she is also doing it for me – because I’ve asked her, and that’s the bond coming through.’

When her retirement day comes, she will go home with Steve and live with him or, when he’s at work, with his parents.

‘She has been an amazing dog. She knows exactly what to do. I can take a step back and let her get on with it. I never have to gee her up.

‘I will miss her when she goes. It’s going to be an emotional day to see her go. She is one of the greats.’
