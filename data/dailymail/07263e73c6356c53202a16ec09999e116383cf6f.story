'Somebody of substantial talent': Paediatrician Melanie Spooner died of heart failure after a 17-year battle with anorexia, an inquest was told

A talented doctor weighed less than four stone when she died after succumbing to the anorexia which had dominated her life.

Cambridge-educated Dr Melanie Spooner, 30, had battled the eating  disorder since the age of 13 and was on long-term sick leave from her children’s hospital.

After her weight plummeted to 3st 11lb, she suffered heart failure and was found dead by her parents at her flat in Woolwich, south-east London.

Dr Spooner, who was awarded a first-class degree in Natural Sciences from Downing College, had also spent time working in  Borneo as a flying doctor.

An inquest at Southwark Coroner’s Court yesterday heard that she suffered from depression and would rarely eat in public.

She had been off work for 11 months from St Thomas’ Children’s Hospital when she died in September.

Her parents Robert and Jane broke into her flat after they were unable to contact her.

They found her body and a note in the kitchen expressing ‘messages of love to her family’, the court heard.

Mr Spooner told the inquest that his daughter had ‘a very healthy childhood’ but had struggled with anorexia throughout her teenage years.

‘My wife helped her back to very good health at about the age of 18 when she went to university but there was the potential to slip up afterwards.’

The chairman of the Royal College of GPs, Dr Clare Gerada, examined Dr Spooner in October 2010.

She told the inquest that Dr Spooner refused to speak to a psychiatrist as she preferred the help of her family and said she ‘did not want to be treated like a child’.

Dominated by the disease: Dr Spooner had been off work for 11 months from her job at St Thomas' Children's Hospital at the time of her death in September

She added: ‘I didn’t weigh her because she didn’t want to be weighed, and she didn’t want to go into psychological issues in consultation.’

A post-mortem examination revealed that Dr Spooner died of cardiac arrhythmia – a heart condition commonly associated with anorexia.

Recording a verdict of natural causes, coroner Dr Adela Williams said: ‘It is always sad when someone dies but worse so when the loss is of such a talented young woman.

‘Melanie was troubled ever since early adolescence by a devastating mental health problem, and that caused her to suffer severe weight loss and abnormal eating patterns.

‘My own impression from the evidence I’ve heard is that it dominated her life. She was clearly somebody of substantial talent, and I understand she was a talented paediatrician.

‘Clearly, in the context of her low weight, her employers became concerned about her.

‘Her weight, while very low indeed, did not further decrease. She was hoping to return to work and, had thoughts of going to work in Australia.

‘It is clear from the evidence I have heard that she had experienced lowness in mood, and her parents became aware of this before she died.’

Dr Spooner achieved the highest possible grades for her A-levels and won a long line of scholastic prizes while she studied at the Royal Free and University College Medical School.

She was also chosen from 1,500 students to be awarded the bronze medal from the University of London after earning a distinction in clinical practice.

In addition, she  coxed her university college men’s rowing crew, played clarinet for two university groups and volunteered for various charities.

Her family, including her brother Simon, said in an obituary for  the British Medical Journal that she would be remembered as a ‘kind, generous, gentle and  caring physician, daughter, sister and friend’.

They added: ‘She always made time for those who needed her, supported and encouraged those around her and amazed and inspired those who knew her.’
