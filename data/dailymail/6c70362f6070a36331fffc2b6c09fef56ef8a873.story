Upset: Brian Fairfield was told to take down the Union Jack from his house in Hull, East Yorkshire

An ex-serviceman was forced to remove a flagpole flying a Union Jack from his garden after neighbours complained it was ‘too noisy’.

Brian Fairfield, from Hull, East Yorkshire, raised the flag for the first time last week but within days was asked to take it down.

The 80-year-old said his landlord Sanctuary Housing had received five complaints from local residents, complaining it was an eyesore and that it made too much noise.

Mr Fairfield said: 'It’s the first time I have heard our national flag being described as offensive to look at.

'I had only managed to raise the flag five or six times before the phone rang to say it had to come down.

'We
 all have rights but surely mine count as much as theirs. The least my 
landlord could have done was to come and see me and the flag for 
themselves.

'It’s not causing anybody any harm.'

Another of Mr Fairfield’s neighbours complained that she couldn’t watch the television while his flag was flying.

'If she wants to watch the television, she should concentrate on that instead of my flag,' he said.

'It’s ludicrous.'

Mr
 Fairfield joined the British Army through National Service in 1952 
before being transferred to serve as a Sergeant in the Parachute 
Regiment in 1954.

The pensioner says he takes pride in being patriotic.

He said: 'Maybe I am more patriotic than the average person.

'When I watch the military parades on television, I have a lump in my throat and tears in my eyes.

'I’ve always wanted a flag but I’ve never had a garden to fly one in until now, and I think it makes my garden look nicer.

'I’m proud to be an Englishman and proud to have been in the forces, so I want to fly my flag, it’s as simple as that.'

Mr Fairfield says he even checked whether he needed planning permission for the flagpole, which is 18ft tall, and hangs his 5ft by 3ft Union Jack flag.

He and his wife Shirley, 68, moved to their bungalow 18 months ago after having problems with their neighbours at their previous home, where they lived for 26 years.

He said: 'We find it very idyllic living here, it’s like our little piece of heaven. But this has really ruined things for us.

'I’ve been totally upset by the whole thing, I can’t believe people can take so much offence over our country’s flag.

'I hope people will see that there are much bigger things to be worried about, rather than stopping an old man from taking pride in his heritage.'

John Hanson, local head of housing operations for Sanctuary Housing, said: 'Mr and Mrs Fairfield are a lovely couple to work with, and we understand that they have the best of intentions.

'Objections were about the size of the flag and the noise it created, not the principle of flying one, and we are more than happy to help the Fairfields come to a suitable agreement with their neighbours.'
