Eating healthily can sometimes be a struggle, but one artist has found a unique way to encourage himself to eat better.

Artist Mike Kravanis makes tasty characters from movies such as The Little Mermaid, 101 Dalmatians, Up and Peter Pan, using rice, vegetables and seafood for his lunch.

The 39-year-old became interested in food art after visiting Hong Kong and Japan.

On his trips to Tokyo Disney Resort and Hong Kong's Disneyland, Mr Kravanis, from Harrison in Pennsylvania, America, was amazed by the creative way foods was served there.

When he returned to the US, he decided to take his own bento boxes to work - a way of encouraging himself to eat better.

In making his own boxes, Mr Kravanis became more and more creative, bringing to life a selection of food-based characters.

Since then, the artist, who works as a software engineer, estimates that he has created more than 250 different bento boxes.

Mr Kravanis became interested in food art when visited Tokyo's Disney Resort and Disneyland in Hong Kong and has even created 'baddie' characters such as Maleficent

The designs, which he obtains by searching for a picture of a particular character online, are uploaded to his Instagram account OMGiri.

As well as fantasy characters, Mr Kravanis also chooses seasonal themes - such as Christmas and Halloween.

Each work of art takes him around an hour to make and are then eaten as his lunch. 

Mr Kravanis said his favourite characters to make are the ones with 'a lot of expression'

Inspired: Mr Kravanis was amazed by the bento boxes he encountered in his travels to the Far East

Dedication: It takes Mr Kravanis an hour to create his mini masterpieces, which he then has for lunch 

He said: 'My favourites to make are always the characters with a lot of expression.

'I enjoy making fun faces though they tend to be extremely challenging. But when it works they are the most interesting to look at.

'I dream of working for a Disney park, making character-shaped food for a living.'

Bento is a single-portion takeaway or home-packed meal common in Japanese cuisine. A traditional bento holds rice, fish or meat, with pickled or cooked vegetables, usually in a box-shaped container.
