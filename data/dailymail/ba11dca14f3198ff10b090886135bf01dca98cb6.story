It may look like something a Bond villain would conjure up as a base for their evil regime, but this research vessel set to be stationed in the middle of the ocean is actually a marine research facility.

Called SeaOrbiter, the floating aquatic lab has been designed by French architect Jacques Rougerie and construction is due to start in 2014.

Almost two-thirds of the 170-ft tall ship will sit underwater making it possible to directly study ecosystems and fish levels at great depths.

This diagram details the different features of the SeaOrbiter vessel. It has a platform lift for divers on the left-hand side, while stern thrusters power the ship. Bunks for the crew as well as the VIP cabin and Captain's room are on the right-hand side. The retractable keel weighs 180 tonnes

French architect Jacques Rougerie designed the incredible structure.

A countdown on the SeaOrbiter site claims construction will start in 201 days, which would make the start 31 May 2014.

The project will cost $52.7 million and has support from Nasa and the European Space Agency because the conditions on the SeaOrbiter are similar to those found in space.

The 1,000 tonne vessel is 170ft tall but almost two thirds of this will be underwater,

Between 18 and 22 marine biologists will live on the hybrid boat laboratory.

It will be the only vessel allowing 24-hour exploration.

Between 18 and 22 marine biologists will be able to live on board the vessel at any one time because it has living quarters and kitchens.

The laboratory part of the 1,000-tonne ship will sit below the surface to make the SeaOrbiter buoyant, but to also give a direct line of sight and access into the ocean to depths of up to 6,000 metres. 

According to Rougerie, the SeaOrbiter will additionally feature a ‘fish-collection system for studies of the pelagic ecosystem, plankton biodiversity, and fish stocks.’

Architect Rougerie developed the concept of the ocean lab around 12 years ago. He built his first underwater house on 4 August 1977.

In 1981 he launched the Hippocampe, a scientific base suspended in mid-water that slept two people.

The Hippocampe was capable of diving to depths of around 12 metres and could stay underwater for between seven and 15 days at a time.

Called SeaOrbiter, the 1,000-tonne floating aquatic lab, pictured, was designed by French architect Jacques Rougerie. Construction on the ship is due to start in May 2014.

Rougerie said: ‘SeaOrbiter is the only vessel in the world allowing a 24-hour exploration on long-term missions of the open sea and the abyss.’

This computer generated image shows what the SeaOrbiter will look like underwater. The French-designed ship will be able to explore depths of around 6,000 metres. Between 18 and 22 marine biologists will live on board at any one time because it has living quarters and kitchens

This is how the SeaOrbiter is expected to look from the ocean floor. The laboratory part of the ship, pictured, will sit below the surface to make the SeaOrbiter buoyant, but to also give a direct line of sight and access into the ocean

It is also environmentally friendly and sustainable because it is powered using solar, wind and wave energy.

Although the SeaOrbiter has been designed to drift with ocean currents, the European Defense and Space systems (EADS) is also said to be developing a biofuel that could be used as a secondary power source.

Previously Rougerie told Inhabitat that the SeaOrbiter: ‘would become an essential tool in exploring the world’s oceans and an useful base to study the link between global warming and the oceans, which absorb about a quarter of all carbon emissions.’
