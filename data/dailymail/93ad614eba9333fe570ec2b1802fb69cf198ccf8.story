Dwight Gayle maintained Alan Pardew's 100 per cent record as Crystal Palace manager with a dramatic late winner as Burnley threw away a 2-0 lead for the second time in four days.

In a typical relegation dogfight that had everything including snowstorms and Pardew digging out referee Phil Dowd at half-time, Gayle fired home his second goal for the game after 87 minutes to break Burnley hearts.

While the Londoners climbed to 12th place as a result, Burnley are now just a point outside the drop zone and will fall into the bottom three if Hull City get a draw or better against West Ham on Sunday.

It was a familiar feeling for both clubs. Palace came from behind to beat Spurs last weekend while Burnley were beaten 4-2 at Spurs in the FA Cup on Wednesday night having led 2-0.

'It was a famous and fabulous victory,' said Pardew, who has now won three on the trot since leaving Newcastle United to succeed Neil Warnock at Selhurst Park.

'We had to show tremendous qualities against a Burnley side that were on their mettle. Not just resilience but flair and bravery to pass the ball as well. Gayle is an uncomplicated player, two good feet, quick, can finish. Not much more you can ask for really!'

For Dyche, he now has an almighty job lifting his players off the floor after another massive disappointment.

'I didn't feel comfortable at 2-0,' he admitted. 'We were just below-par for some reason. We didn't have our usual technical bravery.'

A sharp, sudden snowstorm greeted both sets of players as they stepped out at Turf Moor and Burnley treated Palace as southern softies in the first 18 minutes as they raced into a two-goal lead.

Kieran Trippier's corner looped over Palace goalkeeper Julian Speroni allowing Ben Mee to head in from close range after losing his marker Joe Ledley in the 12th minute. 

Six minutes later, Joel Ward was robbed by Scott Arfield by the touchline as he tried to usher the ball out for a throw. He fed Danny Ings and the England under-21 striker finished low past Speroni.

Pardew was unhappy with both goals. 'The corner wasn't taken from the quadrant for the first, and the officials didn't see their player (Arfield) dump our defender on the pitch, they were concentrating on whether the ball had crossed over the touchline,' he said.

But instead of feeling sorry for themselves, Palace – who could hardly score an away goal under Warnock – got busy. Wilfried Zaha and Gayle swapped flanks and it worked. 

Zaha, now on the right nearly set up James McArthur to score after 28 minutes and though Trippier got in a block, the ball fell to Gayle who fired in.

Pardew approached referee Phil Dowd in the centre circle at half-time 'I didn't moan about the goals, it was because he wouldn't let us take a corner at the end of the half,' explained the Palace manager.

His players were just as fired up and after 48 minutes Palace were level, Burnley defenders backing off as Jason Puncheon received a pass from Gayle and fired in from 20 yards.  

'I had Punch at Southampton and he is a different player now, he has that inner confidence from playing in the Premier League,' said the Eagles boss.

There was another late flurry of snow – and a late flurry of activity on the pitch too. James McArthur cleared off the line from Michael Keane and then Palace substitute Glenn Murray, who had replaced disappointing debutant Yaya Sanogo, struck a post.

Then, with three minutes left, Murray used his body to help Puncheon's pass reach Gayle at the far post. The forward's take with his right foot was brilliant, and he then fired past Heaton with his left. The Eagles are soaring.
