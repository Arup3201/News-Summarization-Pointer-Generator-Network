It was, perhaps, a Christmas miracle.

While Melony Gallagher, a cat owner from Plymouth, slept soundly in bed on Christmas Eve, her beloved pet Suki was, she believes, out enjoying a magical ride.

For, according to the readings from her high-tech GPS collar, she managed to travel 12 miles directly across the rooftops of Plymouth in a matter of minutes - logging a top speed of 183mph.

And with Father Christmas in the air doing his festive rounds, Ms Gallagher was left with only one conclusion to draw - that Suki had hitched a ride on his sleigh.

Although there were no other signs of a supernatural journey on the nonplussed moggy, nor even a whiff of reindeer, Ms Gallagher discounted the possibility the G-Paws tracker had malfunctioned, and spread the word of her Yuletide mystery.

Posting on Facebook the next day, she said: 'I live alone, was asleep in bed and my cat had the unit on at the time this was recorded.The top speed was 183mph!

'She went from my street to a location miles away in the middle of a river, then back again for a while then again to another location miles away in one minute, travelled over rooftops and then home again!

Log: The readings from the G-Paws device show the route Suki is supposed to have taken - in a straight line over the rooftops of Plymouth

'The unit has been used on her daily for weeks with no previous issues. You can see the difference in how it was moving by comparing her normal meandering route and the route travelled that night - too fast for a car and not via the streets but over the houses!

'I've not believed in Santa since I was a child but think maybe she hitched a ride in his sleigh?'

However, the makers of G-Paws were not in the mood for a miracle, and pointed out that their devices are prone to giving inaccurate readings when their batteries run low.

Riding with Mr Claus? Ms Gallagher deduced that only hitching a ride with Father Christmas could have moved Suki so far so fast

Managing director Dave Evans told local paper the Plymouth Herald: 'I’m afraid the reality is rather less exciting. Occasionally when the unit runs a little low on power it will only take a partial reading and second guess where it is.

'It sometimes gets it wrong which results in spikes in the tracklog. The best way to avoid them is to keep the unit fully charged as it tends to happen when it’s low on power.'
