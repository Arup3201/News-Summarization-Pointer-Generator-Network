A passenger plane was pulled from the mud at a Delaware airport almost a full 24 hours after getting stuck and getting help from the National Guard.

Frontier Airlines flight 1435 heading from New Castle Airport to Orlando was freed around 6.45pm today after first coming off of the runway while taxing at 9.17pm Sunday.

Passengers were flown to Florida around 1pm on a replacement plane that came to Delaware from Denver earlier on Monday, leaving grounds crew outside Wilmington to try and dislodge the aircraft.

Frontier Airlines flight 1435 from Delaware to Orlando became stuck in the mud at New Castle Airport at 9.17pm Sunday night

The pilot had been making a turn when the front of the plane went off the runway into the grass. The plane wasn't towed out of the position until 6.45pm Monday evening

The low-cost airline's plane was making a turn when its front tires went off the runway into the grass and sank into the mud.  

'I guess the pilot backed out 20 feet and we heard a 'boom,'' said Diane Skilton of Elkton, Maryland, told WPVI.

'The flight attendant was next to me and she went flying. We all reached out to kind of get her, we thought we hit something.'

More than 100 crew and passengers were on the 70-ton plane, which had to be emptied.

Crews including members of the Delaware Air National Guard worked to free the plane by digging around the wheels and using inflated air bags to elevate it

No injuries were reported in the incident, though passengers had to wait for a replacement plane to arrive from Denver on Monday to fly to their destination

It took ground crews and members of the Delaware Air National Guard until Monday evening to free the aircraft's nose gear and the right main gear, according to the News Journal.

Dirt was dug up and wood was placed underneath the tires so the plane could be towed out of its muddy mess. 

Crews also used inflated air bags to elevate the plane, making it easier to tow. 

No injuries were reported in the incident. 

The Sunday flight was supposed to have left about 30 minutes before it got stuck, according to FlightAware.
