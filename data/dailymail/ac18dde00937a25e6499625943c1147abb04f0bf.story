An incredible collection of the earliest tabloid 'newspapers', which detail the shocking crimes and dying confessions of hanged 18th century convicts, are due to be sold at auction next week.

The so-called 'Execution Broadsides' - which usually consisted of just a single sheet of paper - documented the gruesome and gory facts and rumours which surrounded public hangings.

The sheets of printed news, which were usually sold for a penny near the gallows on the day of the hanging, covered the crime committed, a woodcut illustration, a description of the convict's final hours and their last dying confession - all in sensational, dramatic detail.

'Execution Broadsides' were produced to sell for a penny on the day of a hanging and included the gruesome and gory facts which surrounded hangings in the 18th and 19th Centuries. This sheet include details of the trial  of  Patrick  Carroll,   for  the Wilful  Murder  of  Mrs  Browning and was sold in 1835

The sheets of printed news, which were  sold for a penny near the gallows on the day of the hanging, covered the crime committed, a woodcut illustration, a description of the convict's final hours and his last dying confession. This sheet involves the trial and execution of Henry Hughes, for Violating Emma Cock in 1834

Vendors would set up their carts and booths hours before execution time, selling food, drink, souvenirs and even pornographic material to a frenzied crowd. 

Minstrels and jugglers also entertained the masses, while touts tried to sell the lurid 'broadsheets', which came about due to the advent of cheap printing in the 16th and 17th centuries. 

Now, eleven clippings from a private collection from the 18th and 19th centuries are being sold at at Dominic Winter Auctioneers in Cirencester, Gloucester.

Chris Albury, an auctioneer and senior valuer, said the historic sheets show the 'fun' tabloid journalism of the day and are seen as one of the first examples of tabloid journalism. 

He said: 'They are good fun. It's tabloid journalism of the day. The wood cuts are quite crude. They are very graphic, dramatic items.

'It is nice to see such a big group of them together. A collection like this is routinely found in the British Library. Behind every copy there is a great story. Also, the more gruesome the crime, the more interested people are.' 

Vendors would set up their carts and booths hours before execution time, selling food, drink, souvenirs and even pornographic material to a frenzied crowd. This sheet refers to the hanging of William Harley for a burglary in 1836

The 'broadsheets' came about due to the advent of cheap printing in the 16th and 17th centuries. This early example of tabloid journalism involved details of the murder of James Andrew Macauley, a young sailor, in 1834

Eleven clippings from that era are being sold at Dominic Winter Auctioneers in Cirencester, Gloucester. One of those being auctioned is the story of the execution of R. Blakesley, who murdered James Burdon in 1841

This sheet covers the confession and excution of J. Tawell, who was hanged for the murder of Sarah Hart in 1845, with whom he had an affair 

Each of the execution broadsides - which span from 1787 1846 - covers one particular crime from the time, with text and drawings both giving the reader details of the horrific crime.

One headline reads: 'The Father's Crime; or Fatal Curiosity. An affecting and true history of The Unnatural Murder of James Andrew Macauley, a Young Sailor, For his Wealth, and who proved, on the Morning after the Fatal Deed, to be the Murderer's long-lost and only son!'

Four of the sheets cover the brutal murders of people in the community, while other covered stories include a burglary and 'violating Emma Cock, a girl only 8 years old'.

It proclaims: 'The trial and execution of Henry Hughes, who suffered death this morning, at the county goal, Horsemonger Lane, Southwalk, for Violating Emma Cock, a girl only 8 Years old.'

This shows one of the detailed images which was used in the reports. This one related to the execution of R. Blakesley, for the murder of Mr James Burdon in 1841

The copy goes on to say: 'On Monday, March 3, 1834, the inhabitants of Norwood and its vicinity, were thrown into the utmost horror, on learning that a most diabolical outrage had been committed in Penge Wood, on a child named Emma Cock, only eight years old; and a young man, named Henry Hughes, was, on representation of two lads, and other occurring circumstances, apprehended on the same day by Bedser, a constable, and taken before S. Elyard, esq. at Streatham, who, upon hearing the evidence, committed him to Horsemonger-lane goal, until the following Saturday, March 8th, the child being too ill to attend.'

Another headline reads: 'Life, trial, and Awful. Execution, of William Harley, for the Chipstead Burglary.'
