Military option: Colonel Richard Kemp has warned that Britain risks being sucked into military action in Syria to prevent bloodshed spreading

Britain risks being sucked into military action in Syria to prevent bloodshed spreading, a former Army commander has warned.

Colonel Richard Kemp, who led UK forces in Afghanistan, said the escalating civil war made it increasingly likely that the West would be forced to step in.

But defence analysts warned that a force of at least 300,000 troops would be needed to carry out a full-scale intervention.

Even then, this would face fierce resistance. At least 75,000 would be needed to secure Syria’s chemical weapons stockpiles.

Although the weapons are thought to be safe, earlier this week the Assad regime said it would use them in the event of any invasion by foreign forces.

Military chiefs in London are already drawing up contingency plans in case the UK decides to deploy troops to the volatile region.

Former SAS soldiers are helping to train rebel fighters in Syria in military tactics from weapon handling, leadership and the use of communications systems to tackle Basher al-Assad’s brutal regime.

Last week his teetering regime was rocked when the rebels succeeded in assassinating four top security advisers, including two defence ministers.

But last night it was reported that the Assad regime had attempted to reassert control by using, for the first time, fighter jets on its own people.

The air attacks were said to be concentrated on rebel-held neighbourhoods of Syria’s second city, Aleppo.

If confirmed, would represent a dramatic escalation in the civil war.

However, the scale of dealing with the conflict and its aftermath in Syria - let alone any military intervention - was spelled out in a 44-page report by experts at the Royal United Services Institute think-tank in London.

The report, A Collision Course For Intervention, said that the task of dampening down the violence inside Syria was now less urgent than preventing spiralling sectarian clashes, trouble spilling over into neighbouring countries and heading off cross-border invasions.

Professor Michael Clarke, the director of RUSI, said: ‘However loathe western governments have been to embrace a creeping intervention in the Syria crisis, the events of recent days have created a step change in the situation that will make a hands-off approach increasingly difficult to maintain.’

Col Kemp said: ‘Whether or not Assad falls, the question of military intervention will remain a live issue.

‘Western political leaders may have no appetite for deeper intervention. But as history has shown, we do not always choose which wars to fight - sometimes wars choose us.

‘Military planners have a responsibility to prepare for intervention options in Syria for their political masters in case this conflict chooses them.

‘Preparation will be proceeding today in several Western capitals and on the ground in Syria and in Turkey.

‘Up to the point of Assad’s collapse, we are most likely to see a continuation or intensification of the under-the-radar options of financial support, arming and advising the rebels, clandestine operations and perhaps cyber warfare from the West.

‘After any collapse, however, the military options will be seen in a different light.’

Prime Minister David Cameron last year ordered British forces into action in Libya.

RAF jets enforced a no-fly zone and bombarded Government forces that threatened civilians, while Royal Navy warships fired missiles from off the Libyan coast and Special Forces helped rebels topple leader Muammar Gaddafi.

Foreign Secretary William Hague last week criticised China and Russia for vetoing a United Nations Security Resolution which would have increased pressure on President Assad’s rule and could have paved the way for military action.
