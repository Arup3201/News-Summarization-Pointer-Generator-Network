The Indian government
 has taken unusual step of revoking most diplomatic privileges afforded 
US consular staff in the country - including immunity from prosecution.

The
 revocation of diplomatic privileges comes as the maid slave wage 
controversy involving Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade threatens to 
further erode India - US relations.

Identity
 cards issued to both consular officials and their family were revoked. 
Officials received new cards showing their updated diplomatic status, 
their families will not be granted any special status. The move was 
first reported by NDTV.

'Mistake': Devyani Khobragade's lawyer claims that officials made an error while reviewing a work visa form she'd submitted for her New York maid

The 
Indian government changed privileges extended to US consular officials 
and their families to bring them in line with what the US grants Indian 
consular officials, a source told NDTV.

This
 new status will apply to all non-United Nations accredited consular 
staff in the country and came after a significant development in New 
York in Ms Khobragade's favor.

The
 United Nations Monday approved a request to accredit her to the Indian 
mission to the UN, according to reports. This should grant her immunity 
from prosecution of any form, but US officials do not appear to be 
budging.

A spokesperson for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara told MailOnline that authorities have no plans to drop any charges.

'As of this time, the charges stand,' the spokesperson added, declining any further comment.

These
 comments come after attorney Daniel Arshack accused authorities of 
misinterpreting the salary paid to housekeeper Sangeeta Richard.showed 
an intended salary and actual salary, according to the Times of India.

The
 intended salary was significantly higher than what was actually paid, 
as Ms Richards' often failed to work 40 hours per week, leading salary 
to be adjusted accordingly, officials told the Times.

The
 servant was paid $9.75 an hour with deductions taken for various 
expenses and some salary paid in cash, the Indian government contends.

US officials have also declined to comment on this assertion.

Devyani Khobragade was arrested earlier this 
month after being accused of lying on a visa application for her 
housekeeper and paying her only $3 per hour

These
 developments came as it was revealed a lawsuit filed months ago on 
behalf of the housekeeper alleging poor working conditions.

Philip Richard, Ms Richard's husband, filed a petition at the High Court in New Delhi in 
July saying that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day. 

Mr Richard also said the consular 
official's father Uttam Khobragade had threatened Mrs Richard's family 
saying that he would have them abducted and framed on false drug 
charges.

The release of the 
new document this week reveals that a legal complaint was lodged against
 Devyani Khobragade in her home country prior to charges of visa fraud 
being filed against her in the U.S. this month. Mr Richard's claim was 
dismissed later in July because the Indian court had 'no jurisdiction...
 on foreign soil'.

Consular
 official Dr Khobragade was arrested this month as she dropped her 
children off at their Manhattan school. She is accused of lying on a 
visa application for Mrs Richard with prosecutors claiming she only paid
 the servant $3 per hour.

Philip Richard, the husband of housekeeper Sangeeta Richard (pictured), filed a court petition in New Delhi saying that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day by diplomat Devyani Khobragade in New York

In the petition, first seen by Outlookindia.com,
 a concerned Mr Richard wrote: 'The treatment of Sangeeta by Devyani 
Khobragade is tantamount to keeping a person in slavery-like conditions 
or keeping a person in bondage.'

The
 petition also stated: 'Uttam Khobragade called Sangeeta's family 
several times and threatened them that they would have to face dire 
consequences if she complains and that he would ruin their future, get 
them abducted and frame false charges of drugs against them.'

Mr
 Richard also wrote that Khobragade had accused his wife of stealing in 
front of a U.S. immigration officer but would not provide details of 
what the woman took.

Mrs
 Richard's daughter Jennifer also wrote a letter to U.S. officials 
saying that her mother was unhappy and wanted to return to India but the
 diplomat refused to let her go.

Mr
 Richard's claim was dismissed in July, according to his lawyer, because
 the high court claimed 'no jurisdiction on a crime committed on foreign
 soil'.

The case has 
escalated into an international incident with Indians reacting with fury
 over the treatment of Khobragade who claims she was strip searched at a
 New York jail before being held in a cell with drug addicts and sex workers.

Uttam Khobragade, father of Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade, has been accused of harassing the family of her housekeeper after they complained about her treatment

Prosecutors allege that Khobragade falsely signed visa documents for the worker saying that she would be paid $4,500 a month.

Then,
 when the housekeeper came to the U.S., Khobragade told her that she 
would be making only 30,000 rupees a month - less than $600, according 
to prosecutors.

India's foreign minister has demanded the U.S. drop charges against Khobragade.

Although Secretary of State John Kerry made a phone call to Indian officials last week to placate the situation, Mr Bharara released a 
statement saying that 
the charges would not be dropped.

The
 statement read: 'One wonders why there is so much outrage about the 
alleged treatment of the Indian national accused of perpetrating these 
acts, but precious little outrage about the alleged treatment of the 
Indian victim and her spouse?'

Attorney Dana Sussman, who is 
representing Mrs Richard though the non-profit victim assistance agency Safe 
Horizon, spoke on Sunday of her ‘frustration and disappointment’ that 
focus had slipped from ‘crimes that were committed’ to ‘the criminal 
defendant.

She pointed out 
that the case was about Dr Khobragade allegedly lying to the federal 
government about the wages she was paying Mrs Richard.

Mrs Richard has claimed she as paid just $3.31 an hour, below minium wage.

Ms Sussman refused to comment on her client and her family’s whereabouts since Mrs Richard walked out of her job in June.

Dana Sussman, who is representing Sangeeta Richard, she says the real story of the alleged fraud has been lost in the diplomatic row

Mrs 
Richard’s husband Philip and parents flew to the U.S. two days before 
police swooped on Khobragade and arresting her at the gates of her 
daughter’s Upper East Side school.

U.S. diplomats in India swiftly found 
many of their privileges rescinded and safety barriers removed from 
their embassy in New Delhi.

Secretary
 of State John Kerry expressed his ‘regret as well as his concern’ over 
the incident in a telephone call to Indian National Security Advisor 
Shivshanker Menon.

He spoke of his hope that the ‘close and vital 
relationship with India’ remain unharmed.

But
 nothing short of dropping the charges – one count of Visa Fraud one of 
False Statement – against Dr Khobragade seems likely to satisfy Indian 
authorities in the case which has now been raised in the nation’s 
parliament.

Against this 
backdrop Mrs Sussman’s statement continued: ‘Mrs Richard is not on trial
 here and we think that the message here has been lost in the fact that 
there are charges against Khobragade for violating US law and those 
charges relate to the underpayment of wages to a domestic worker.

‘That is the story that has been lost in the diplomatic row that has erupted between US and India.’
