As all cat owners know, stroking a purring pet can be very therapeutic.

Now, a Parisian café is attempting to bring the experience to city-dwellers who are unable to keep their own cat.

Customers the café are able to enjoy their coffee and croissants with a cat on their lap - which is said to bring a host of benefits from easing pain to lowering blood pressure.

A new cafe in Paris is allowing people to drink their coffee with one of its 12 resident cats on their lap - bringing supposed health benefits

The ‘Café des Chats’, in the heart of the chic Marais district, has 12 resident cats who weave between the tables and curl up on the armchairs.

The manager, Margaux Gandelon, says that she hopes customers will benefit from ‘purr therapy’ which she claims can have a range of health benefits.

She said: ‘Purring produces vibrations which relieve arthritis and rheumatism and which lower your blood pressure and your heartbeat.’

This month's opening weekend saw queues snaking along the pavement and bookings taken from now until November.

The launch was so popular that some 300 potential customers had to be turned away.

Ms Gandelon says animal welfare is paramount and customers are prohibited from subjecting the cats to undue stress.

She is prepared to evict any customers who fail to play by the rules although she admits she is more lenient with the animal residents: ‘Cats are cats,’ she told Reuters.

The animals themselves are all abandoned and stray cats adopted from pet rescue centres.

Among them is Habby who suffers from feline dwarfism with a stunted tail and unusually short legs.

Despite two years spent with foster families the tabby was never adopted but has now settled down to café life.

Visiting the cafe out of curiosity, business student Florian Laboureau described it as a ‘great concept’, but admitted he is more of a dog person.

Numerous studies have highlighted the health benefits of owning cats.

For example, one study suggested owning a pet can reduce a person’s chances of developing non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma by nearly a third, researchers claim.

Animal lovers are much less likely to develop the cancer of the lymphatic system that affects around 9,000 Britons a year.

Margaux Gandelon said: 'Purring produces vibrations which relieve arthritis and rheumatism and which lower your blood pressure and your heartbeat'

Scientists at the University of California, San Francisco, and Stanford University, also in California, who carried out the study believe pets help protect against cancer by boosting the immune system.

Previous studies have also shown children who have pets take fewer sick days off school because they are more resistant to infections.

Some research even suggests toddlers who grow up around cats or dogs are less likely to suffer allergies or asthma.
