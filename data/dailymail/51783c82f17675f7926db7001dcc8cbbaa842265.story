Motherwell will become a hub for showcasing South American talent if a London-based consortium seizes control of the club in the coming weeks.

Sportsmail can reveal a group of businessmen want to buy a majority stake in the Fir Park outfit with a view to giving emerging players from overseas a foothold in the European game.

Newcastle’s former Peruvian international winger Nolberto Solano attended Motherwell’s victory over Dundee United on Friday night and it’s believed he will be installed as manager if the deal gets over the line.

Motherwell owner John Boyle has handed his 70-per-cent stake to the club with those shares currently being held in a trust fund in the hope the Well Society — the community-based group advocating an ownership — can purchase them.

However, hope of this materialising before this month’s deadline expires is shrouded in doubt.

While the Well Society have so far raised £500,000, it needs to show that £800,000 is in its bank by the end of November for the deal to remain on track.

With the prospect of fan-ownership seemingly dwindling, the London-based consortium have moved into the picture and have made their intentions known to key figures at the club.

It’s believed, however, that the club — and not Boyle — would still benefit financially if the consortium, rather than the Society, purchase the shares.

While a new regime would undoubtedly excite some fans, it’s unlikely to meet with the approval of the Society.

Hinting at the possibility of an alternative takeover in its most recent news letter last month, the Society stated: ‘Given we are very nearly at the cut-off point, we needed to act quickly to make sure that the club remains in the hands of Motherwell fans – there are no guarantees that will be the case if the Well Society does not reach the funds required by the end of November.’

Boyle announced in February 2011 that he was to stand down as chairman at Fir Park which would ‘allow wider ownership and involvement in the club for all who care about it’.

While this hasn’t materialised yet, the Society has helped Motherwell meet cash-flow problems with £780,000 lost in the two seasons between 2011-13 and a further loss predicted for last season.

Despite the possibility of a takeover, the club are still searching for a successor for Stuart McCall as manager.

Sportsmail understands Billy McKinlay and Owen Coyle are among the names under consideration.

McKinlay is out of work having bizarrely lasted just eight days as Watford manager last month.

Last night, when asked if he would be interested in the job, he said: ‘Absolutely. Everyone I’ve spoken to over the years has told me it’s a really good club.’

Coyle has spoken to Houston Dynamo and Philadelphia Union about their vacancies but remains available for hire.

Other names in the frame include Derek Adams, ex-Celtic coach Peter Grant and former Iceland manager Atli Edvalsson.
