Gary Lineker is poised to sign a 
new contract with the BBC to continue as the host of Match of the Day - but the presenter will take an estimated £500,000 pay cut in the process.

The former England striker will now earn around £1.5million a year - a 25 per cent reduction - as he is one of several of the Corporation's stars to be asked to accept a lower salary.

In return he will be the BBC's face of its flagship football show and also present its coverage of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil and beyond.

Lineker's
£2million-a-year deal expires in the summer and his representatives are
confident an extension will be agreed shortly.

In the money: Lineker will take a pay cut, but has a lucrative advertising deal in place with Walkers - one of the longest and most successful partnerships in advertising history

The BBC told MailOnline today the would not comment on the deal, but a source said they were 'confident' it would be signed shortly.

Lineker also has lucrative agreements
to host Al Jazeera's Champions League coverage and his 20-year Walkers 
Crisps association, which runs until 2015, is one of the most successful
and long-running advertising tie-ups involving a sporting celebrity.

Lineker has received offers from the 
United States - the biggest from Fox Soccer before they lost Premier 
League rights to NBC - but the once-a-week MotD commitment fits neatly 
into his schedule.

The former Leicester City, Spurs and Barcelona striker married his second wife Danielle Bux three years ago.

Lineker separated from his first wife

Angus. The couple's 20-year marriage was dissolved in 70 seconds.

A judge accepted that their relationship had irretrievably broken down because of Gary Lineker's 'unreasonable behaviour'.

In High Court papers. Michelle 
Lineker, 40, said the former England striker known as football's 'Mr 
Nice Guy' had caused her 'stress and anxiety'.

Miss Bux has a daughter Ella from a previous relationship to ex-Coventry City footballer Adam Willis.

This
renewed confidence in Lineker continuing to head BBC coverage for several more years follows the decision to axe Colin 
Murray as host of the Sunday highlights programme Match of the Day 2 next season. He will be replaced by 5 Live presenter Mark Chapman.

It is understood that the Ulsterman had also irritated a number of BBC football pundits by the way he criticised players.

Lineker's MotD colleague Alan Hansen reportedly also agreed a £500,000 pay cut last year. Alan Shearer and Mark Lawrenson also faced salary reductions when they discuss new deals.

Hansen’s pay had been the subject of controversy after it was revealed he was earning £1.5million a year for his comments - around £40,000 per show.

Sources said he ‘didn’t complain’ and was keen to stay on, adding that compared with most people in the industry he was still ‘on a very good deal’.

The other pundits are expected to face cuts of about 20 per cent because they are paid less – Shearer is believed to be on £500,000 a year.
