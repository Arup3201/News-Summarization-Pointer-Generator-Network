The son of U.S. Senator Mark Udall has been charged with breaking into a home and four cars after allegedly using heroin.

Twenty-six-year-old Jedediah Lee Fox-Udall was advised of the charges during a brief court hearing in Boulder Thursday.

He faces charges of trespassing, burglary, theft and possession of drug paraphernalia.

Deputies say after they arrested Fox-Udall on January 30, he told them he had recently used heroin, but prosecutors say no heroin was found and he wasn't charged with drug possession.

His lawyer, Alex Garlin, says Fox-Udall is in an addiction treatment program and 'is dedicated to turning his life around.'

Fox-Udall's mother, Maggie Fox, sat beside him in the courtroom, her hand resting on his leg. They both left in a waiting SUV without comment.

'Maggie and I are deeply distressed to learn of our son's arrest,’ Sen. Mark Udall said in a statement to the Boulder Daily Camera following the arrest.

‘We love our son and stand with him in his commitment to getting the treatment he needs. We appreciate the private space to deal with this as a family.’

Senator Udall is a Democrat Senator of Colorado who represented the region in the House of Representatives before winning his Senate seat in 2008.

Senator Udall is running for re-election this year.

Last July, Senator Udall's brother James 'Randy' Udall, 61, was found dead after a hiking trip in Pinedale, Wyoming.

The Udalls have a long, illustrious history as politicians in Western states.

The Senator’s cousin Tom Udall is the senior U.S. Senator from New Mexico and cousin Gordon Smith was a U.S. Senator from Oregon until 2008.

His uncle, Stewart Udall, was Interior secretary in the 1960s. His father was the late U.S. Rep. Morris ‘Mo’ Udall of Arizona.

Senator Udall  has voted for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and to expand background checks for gun purchases.

n 2011 he attempted to end indefinite detention of U.S. citizens by introducing an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, but it was rejected by the Senate.
