Wanted: Police killed Donald Hux, the ex-husband of Sandy Carl Huckabee's wife Amy, in a shoot out Sunday night. He was the main suspect in the death of both Amy and her current husband Sandy

Police have killed the man who murdered the cousin of former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, and the suspect shot ex-wife dead during the ensuing fire fight.

The shootout occurred in the late hours of Sunday night, after they found Donald Hux, 36, following a frenzied manhunt.

The investigation began when Sandy Carl Huckabee was found dead in his Arkadelphia home, 70 miles south west of Little Rock, Arkansas.

Sandy Carl is the first cousin of the state's former governor and one-time Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee.

Sandy was married to Amy Huckabee, who was the ex-wife of Donald Hux.

The former spouses had three children together, and after killing Sandy, Hux took the children and Amy 80 miles south to El Dorado, Arkansas.

Police finally found Hux, hours after he had dropped the children off safely at an unknown location in El Dorado and switched vehicles.

'In the events that followed, Donald Hux shot Amy Huckabee followed by deputies fatally wounding Hux,' the police press release reads.

Union County Sheriff's Captain Clark Burton said the children were not hurt.

Relatives: Mike (left) and Sandy Carl (right) Huckabee grew up together in Hope, Arkansas and the former governor said their mothers were sisters. Sandy was found dead in his home Sunday morning

Divorced: Donald Hux and Amy Huckabee are divorced and have three children from their time together. Hux dropped their children off at his parents' house Sunday morning, and killed Amy

Scene: Sandy Carl Huckabee's body was found in his Arkadelphia home and is said to have suffered a trauma to his head

Officers in Arkadelphia learned about the
 situation and went to the Huckabee home to do a welfare check and found
 Sandy Huckabee's body inside.

Sandy
 appeared to have suffered a head trauma, but little else is known about
 the crime scene. no weapons were found at the scene, and police have 
said that they consider Hux to be armed and dangerous.

The little that is known about the relationship between Amy Huckabee and her ex-husband is troubling. A local paper said that there are police records of Hux sending harassing communications to his ex-wife from jail several months ago.

He pleaded guilty to a charge of misdemeanour assault in Caddo Parish, Louisiana, which is not far from Amy Huckabee's home town of Springhill.

Jim Harris, a spokesman for Huckabee 
when he was governor, said the former Republican governor was travelling
 but had learned of the distant relative's death.

'I've been in Washington all day. 
Sandy was my first cousin. Our mothers were sisters and we grew up as 
kids in Hope. It's been a horrible day for everyone, especially those 
kids,' Mike Huckabee told a local news station by email.

At
 the time of his death, Sandy worked as a clinical psychologist and had 
previously worked in the public school system in Arkadelphia.

The
 Union County police department is due to reveal updated details in a 
press release Monday morning, but the press conference was pushed back 
as the sheriff has not arrived yet this morning.

'They had a late night last night,' the receptionist told MailOnline.
