The French are to pay a major tribute to the part British forces played in saving Paris from the Germans during World War I.

In what is seen as a major change in attitude, President Francois Hollande will lead the tributes.

He will visit the Museum of the Great War, at Meaux, east of Paris, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the First Battle of the Marne.

It is usually portrayed as a Franco-German action, in which the so-called ‘Miracle of the Marne’ forced the Kaiser’s Imperial Army to abandon its advance on Paris.

But in fact, the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) under Sir John French was at the forefront of the fighting.

Former French government minister Jean-François Copé, who is also the mayor of Meaux, said: ‘We must remember that this victory was a victory for the Allies together.

‘Indeed, the British Army, though numerically small, was decisive in the first months of the conflict.’

Mr Hollande will be in Meaux at the end of next week, while Prince Andrew will be in Frétoy, north east of Paris, on Sunday.

It is there, on September 7, 1914, that the 9th Queen's Royal Lancers took part in the last ‘lance on lance’ action of the Great War.

The Prince will honour some 100 British troops who served in Afghanistan with medals.

The main exhibition at the Meaux museum, one of the most impressive in Europe, now concentrates on the BEF’s progress from August to December 1914.

Many landed in France thinking the war would be over by Christmas, but were soon involved bloody battles, including Marne, which started 100 years ago tomorrow.

After a week of fierce fighting, the Germans’ pursuit of the Allied armies was repelled along the Marne River.

French troops famously arrived in taxis from central Paris, where the population feared the humiliation of occupation.

Once the Germans were themselves forced to retreat, the war turned into four years of bloody trench warfare, in which millions were killed and wounded.

Sir John French’s baton is on loan to the French from the Imperial War Museum in London, while the Meaux exhibition tells of the ‘common strategy’ they developed.

Famous marching songs including ‘It’s a Long Way To Tipperary’ will be played throughout the week of commemorations, and the Royal Navy’s decisive victories early in the war will also be featured.

French politicians have, over the years, been accused of underplaying Britain’s role in the world wars at the expense of their own efforts, and America’s.

But President Hollande has done much to reverse this trend – regularly paying tribute to the sacrifice millions of Britons made.
