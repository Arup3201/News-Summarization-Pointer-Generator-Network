Married to one of the most powerful men in the kingdom and mistress of another, Elizabeth Chudleigh's future seemed secure.

But all that came crashing down after it was discovered that Chudleigh was not only unfaithful to her first husband, she'd married her second while he was still alive.

The court case that ensued convulsed Georgian high society and after being roasted in the press and shunned by society, Chudleigh fled abroad, never to return.

So who was Georgian Britain's most notorious resident? Born in 1720, Chudleigh was the daughter of Colonel Thomas Chudleigh and counted the children of Prime Minister Sir Robert Walpole among her childhood companions.

As a young woman in 1743, she was appointed maid-of-honour to Princess Augusta, wife of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and mother of the future George III.

The same year, she made a glittering marriage to the Hon. Augustus John Hervey, the future Earl of Bristol but it wasn't long before things began to go wrong.

Her marriage was unhappy and by 1744 she had embarked on the first of several affairs - infidelity that eventually led to the couple separating just five years later.

In the same year, she scandalised society by appearing in public in a flesh-coloured skintight gown that made her appear nude.

In
 a book written about her in 1788, The Life and Memoirs of 
Elizabeth Chudleigh, the incident was given pride of place.

Wrote the anonymous author: 'It
 has been asserted this lady appeared [at a masquerade] in a shape of 
flesh-coloured silk so nicely and closely fitted to her body as to 
produce a perfect review of the unadorned mother of mankind, and that 
this fair representative of frailty, … had contrived a method of giving 
as evident tokens of modesty, by binding her loins with a partial 
covering, or zone, of fig-leaves.'

The book, which appears in British Library exhibition, Georgians Revealed: Life, Style and the Making of Modern Britain, is one of several artifacts charting her scandalous life currently on show in London.

'She led a very  eventful life,' adds Moira Goff, a curator at the British Library. 'Her love 
of fine living, particularly jewellery, good food and wine and luxurious
 surroundings, as well as her enjoyment of publicity and her scandalous 
private life, made her celebrated.

'She has much in common with 
celebrities of the 21st century and would undoubtedly have been the 
subject of much gossip in today’s newspapers and magazines.'

But
 her most scandalous moment was still to come. After separating from her
 first husband, Chudleigh began a relationship with Evelyn Pierrepoint, 
Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull.

And
 in 1769, she married him after obtaining a legal agreement that stated 
her first marriage was invalid. As she was soon to discover, it wasn't.

When
 the Duke died in 1773, he left her everything on condition that she 
remain a widow. Once again, Chudleigh's future seemed assured but it 
wasn't to last.

No sooner 
had the ink dried on the Duke's death certificate, his furious nephew 
and heir, Charles Medow, the first Earl Manvers, accused Chudleigh of 
bigamy; a case that soon reached the scandal sheets and the ears of her 
former boss, Princess Augusta.

'The
 Royal family reacted with complete silence,' comments Goff,  'although 
it seems likely that Elizabeth Chudleigh’s court links became more 
tenuous and ceased completely when her bigamous marriage became public 
knowledge.'

The Georgian 
public, by contrast, lapped up the scandal. 'The Georgians loved juicy 
gossip and controversy – the stuff of the newspapers and magazines that 
were being published in ever-increasing numbers from the mid-1700s,' 
adds Goff.

'Elizabeth 
Chudleigh was a well-known member of the highest society and her 
behaviour  was particularly outrageous – all the more so as she was 
someone that the middle classes were supposed to look up to.'

By the time the court case rumbled to a close in 1776, Chudleigh was considered one of the most notorious women in the UK.

She
 was also considered a bigamist, with the court ruling in Earl Manvers 
favour. Humiliated, she fled Britain for Paris, where she died in 1788 
under the name of the Countess of Bristol - the title given to her by 
her first husband.

'Elizabeth
 Chudleigh flouted convention both socially and morally and apparently 
had little regard for public opinion, although she seems to have enjoyed
 her ill-gotten fame,' says Goff.

'She
 certainly deserved her notoriety, and she was obviously a fairly 
self-absorbed woman but there's something attractive about her zest for 
life.'

Georgians 
Revealed: Life, Style and the Making of Modern Britain runs until the 
11th March at the British Library. Tickets cost £9 for adults and 
concessions are available.

Along with Elizabeth Chudleigh, one of the most notorious women to appear in the British Library exhibition is Fanny Murray, the mistress of John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, and the star of an early tabloid sensation.

Her wanton antics inspired a pornographic poem entitled An Essay on Women, a parody of Alexander Pope's An Essay on Man, which was written by John Wilkes, an early press pioneer.

When the ditty was discovered, more than a decade after being written, it caused a scandal.

Wilkes, who was already in trouble with Parliament after writing a disobliging article about the monarch, was forced to flee abroad to escape further obscenity charges.
