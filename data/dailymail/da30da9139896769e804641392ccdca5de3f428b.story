A smiling Pippa Middleton gave Guy Pelly's exclusive Mexican-themed nightclub her seal of approval last night when she partied the night away with the Chelsea set.

The 29-year-old was chic in a monochrome ensemble of black suede ankle boots, a flared snakeprint skirt and smart black jacket as she left the new Sloane Square venue with new beau Tom Kingston.

Her appearance at Tonteria will lend cachet to the latest venture for entrepeneur Pelly, 30, a close friend of the princes who is said to have organised William's stag do.

Glossy posse: Pippa shakes the rain from her umbrella as she climbs into a taxi outside hip new nightspot Tonteria

Stylish couple: The 29-year-old looked chic in black suede ankle boots and a monochrome snakeprint skirt, while new beau Tom Kingston was handsome in a navy suit and grey scarf, with a bright blue shirt

Seal of approval: The attendance of the younger Middleton sister could trigger a flood of visits by the inner circle of young royals

Making waves: Tom and Pippa have been dating since October and appear to have plenty in common

The Duchess's sister kept out the cold with sensible black opaques, swishing her long mane of glossy chestnut hair and grasping a black leather clutch as she cheerfully slipped out of the club under the shelter of an umbrella.

Pelly's last Chelsea nightclub, Public, was forced to close after complaints that it had become the well-heeled area's 'number one crime generator', with rich twenty-somethings causing havoc as they stumbled home in the early hours.

Stowe-educated Pelly owns popular clubs Mahiki and Whisky Mist, but still needs the boost of a successful new project after the embarrassing blow of Public's closure led some to speculate that he was relying on the status of his well-connected friends.

So Pippa's beam as she left the fledging nightspot will do much to cement the stylish reputation of the club, which launched in October to great fanfare.

Royal cachet: Pippa's chic appearance will be a boon for Pelly, whose last nightclub venture was shut down after becoming Chelsea's 'number one crime generator'

Ariba! Pippa and friends enjoyed tequila-based cocktails served in skull-shaped bowls and mixed at their table, as well as sharing platters loaded with nibbles including tacos and nachos

Christmas night out: Pippa let her hair down as she showed off her new squeeze to friends

The partygoers lounged on hammocks and were served tacos on sharing platters and cocktails in skull-shaped punch bowls at the themed bar, already a hit with the likes of Otis Ferry, Lady Natasha Rufus Isaacs and Prince Harry's on-off girlfriend Chelsy Davy.

Pippa seems happier than ever since she started appearing in public with Kingston last month, just weeks after splitting with cricketing boyfriend Alex Loudon.

The rugged 34-year-old Bristol graduate could be the perfect man for the younger Middleton sister, having worked at Schroders private bank and procuring the release of hostages in Iraq.

He is already well used to the royal circle, as the ex-boyfriend of Prince Williamâ€™s former squeeze, Natalie Hicks-Loebbecke.

New author Pippa certainly looked more than pleased with her pre-Christmas night out at the subterranean Tonteria, and her visibly glowing recommendation could trigger a rush of young royals keen to down some tequilas at the trendy venue.
