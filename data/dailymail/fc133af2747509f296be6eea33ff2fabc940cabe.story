The Home Office's first Forensic Science Regulator claims that human error, partial prints and false positives mean that fingerprints evidence is not as reliable as is widely believed

Human fingerprints may not be unique, according to the Home Office's first Forensic Science Regulator.

This cornerstone of criminal investigation and identification may be flawed, as Mike Silverman claims that human error, partial prints and false positives mean that fingerprints evidence is not as reliable as is widely believed.

Mr Silverman, who introduced the first automated fingerprint detection system to the Metropolitan Police, said: 'No two fingerprints are ever exactly alike in every detail; even two impressions recorded immediately after each other from the same finger.

'And the fingerprint often isn't 
perfect, particularly at a crime scene. It might be dirty or smudged. 
There are all sorts of things that reduce the accuracy.

'And not everyone's fingerprints have been recorded so it's impossible to prove that no two are the same.

'It's improbable, but so is winning the lottery, and people do that every week.'

Other
 factors which can reduce the 'uniqueness' of finger prints include 
certain skin conditions which can make the fingertips smooth, and 
elderly people's skin changing in elasticity. Families also share 
extremely similar patterns.

Mr
 Silverman stressed that juries are should be made better informed of 
these caveats, and said: 'I think it is important that juries are aware 
of this.

'Too often they 
see programmes like CSI and that raises their expectations. What you see
 on CSI or Silent Witness simply doesn't exist.

He added that the same logic could be applied to the assumption that all DNA is unique, as this claim is impossible to prove.

Incorrect fingerprint evidence has led to several cases of innocent people being wrongly linked to criminal cases.

In 2004, Brandon Mayfield, was wrongly linked to the Madrid train bombings by FBI fingerprint experts in the United States and Shirley McKie, a Scottish police officer, was wrongly accused of having been at a murder scene in 1997 after a print supposedly matching hers was found near the body.
