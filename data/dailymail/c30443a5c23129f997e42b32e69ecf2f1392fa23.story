Five years after her husband was kicked to death in an attack that shocked Britain, Helen Newlove has married again.

In a small ceremony on Merseyside with family and loved-ones around her she tied the knot with Paul Shacklady, 47.

Her three children Zoe, 23, Danielle, 20, and Amy, 17, were there to support their mother on a happy day after such a tragic end to her previous marriage in 2007.

Garry Newlove was murdered by yobs outside his home when he confronted a gang who were vandalising his car in Warrington, Cheshire, and was kicked 'like a football', dying in hospital three days later.

Mrs Newlove has campaigned tirelessly to improve community safety while cutting alcohol-related violence and started Newlove Warrington, a charity set up to encourage people in her area to be safer.

And now she has found love with divorcee Mr Shacklady.

'Garry will always have a special place in my heart and Paul has brought happiness I thought I never could have after the loss of Garry,' she told The Sun.

Formby Hall Golf Resort and Spa, just north of Liverpool, was the venue for the marriage that took place over the summer.

On the marriage certificate, Helen, who is in the House of Lords, gave her occupation as 'Government champion for Active, Safer Communities', and divorcee Paul said he was an 'administrator'.

Her tragic former husband Garry was killed by violent teenagers Stephen Sorton, Adam Swellings and Jordan Cunliffe, who denied his murder but were convicted at Chester Crown Court in 2008 and then jailed for life.

Helen said at the time: 'The light has gone out of our lives - it's like a piece of jigsaw has been lost forever. The tiniest of things we used to do as a family feels like it takes forever to achieve them. We all sit at home, the girls and I and wait for Garry to walk through the door.'

She added her husband's death was harder to accept because he had successfully battled stomach cancer 15 years earlier.

'It was a lovely, simple ceremony in a beautiful setting in front of a select group of friends and family,' a source told the Sun.

'Like most weddings the second time around, it was conducted by a registrar with little fuss. But that doesnâ€™t lessen the love they have for each other.

'If anyone deserves to find happiness again it is Helen and her girls. After what they have been through everyone is delighted for them.'
