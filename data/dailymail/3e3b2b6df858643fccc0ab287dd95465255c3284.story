Stefan Johansen has told his Celtic teammates to ‘man up’ after conceding they simply weren’t good enough in Poland.

A feeble, porous 4-1 defeat to Legia Warsaw leaves Scotland’s champions facing a monumental task to reach the group stages for a third successive year.

Johansen believes, as he must, that Celtic can still qualify. And he reckons Legia’s players behaved at time up as if they were already through to the play-off round.

Rallying cry: Stefan Johansen has told his team-mates to stand up and be counted

Yet a display characterised by dubious team selection, poor defending, weak tackling and self-inflicted errors confirmed fears that the squad inherited by Ronny Deila lacks the depth or investment needed to compete at Europe’s highest level.

Insisting there is no time for self pity ahead of a second-leg salvage job, however, Norwegian midfielder Johansen says Celtic have to pick themselves up swiftly and plan a way to score three or more at Murrayfield. All whilst defending in a way which seemed beyond them in Poland.

‘It was really bad,’ said Johansson, Deila’s former lieutenant at Stromsgodset. ‘When you go down to 10 men and you are keeping in the game at 2-1, it’s almost an okay result in the circumstances.

‘But that was the time when we needed to stick together and keep that scoreline until the end of the match.

‘You have to be tight at that time, yet we gave away two more easy goals. We tried to communicate things on the pitch, but we should have been tighter and not allowed Legia to get those goals near the finish of the match.

‘There is no way we should be letting them get their two penalties and their goals. It was bad from us and it is tough to take right now.

‘We need to have a sit down and talk about the game during the next days. What we must do is learn the lessons from Warsaw and learn how to do things better.

‘We need to forget about what happened as soon as possible and man up - because this was just not good enough. We have to accept the facts of what we need to do.’

Questions will inevitably be asked of Deila, who looked haunted and shocked by what transpired in the Pepsi Arena.

A risky team selection raised eyebrows even before kick-off and in the first major test of his credibility as Celtic manager, the Norwegian failed to secure pass marks.

‘I can’t say anything about what was said afterwards,’ added Johansen. ‘That always stays in the locker room.

‘I also can’t talk for the manager but obviously he wants to win games just the same as the players do and, of course, he was disappointed with the match.

‘Looking at the Legia players at the end of the match, it looked as though they were through to the next round already.

‘So I am going to be ready for next week because we still have a chance to be the ones celebrating at the end of the second leg.’

It’s far from inconceivable Celtic could win 3-0 in Edinburgh. The club’s history is littered with unlikely comebacks against the likes of Cologne, Sporting Lisbon and Shakhtar Karangandy last season.

Yet the lack of shape and cohesion in the current squad draws closer comparisons with the mess Gordon Strachan inherited in 2005.

A 5-0 defeat to Artmedia Bratislava was almost overturned, but the loss of Celtic Park to the Commonwealth Games now comes at a heavy price.

When they need their spiritual home most, Celtic must now try to achieve a minor miracle at the home of Scottish Rugby instead. Numbers will increase, but by Wednesday night just 12,000 tickets had been sold.

Insisting the team need their fanbase more than ever at Murrayfield, a defiant Johansen said: ‘We still have a chance to get through this tie and we have to go for it.

‘Of course I believe this can still be done. If there is ever a chance of doing something, I always believe in it and believe we are going to take that chance.

‘That is the type of person and footballer that I am. Hopefully, everybody around the club still believes because there is still a chance for us.

‘It is going to be tough but we need to make sure we are ready for the second leg.’

If they fail, then a Europa League play-off provides a safety net of sorts. But there will be no cast-iron guarantees of European football this season.

‘I don’t think about Europa League at this stage, I only think about Champions League and being ready for this challenge next Wednesday,’ said Johansen.

‘We still have a chance and I feel we are good enough on a better day than Warsaw to make it through to the next round.’
