Ferguson was still smoldering this morning after a night of rage that left large part of the city in flames or ruins.

At least two dozen businesses were torched during the night of chaos leaving one entire block looking like a warzone.

At the corner of West Florissant Avenue and Chambers street a strip of seven shops had been ransacked or burned down.

Prime Beauty on the corner had completely collapsed on itself and fires were still burning inside the building.

Trail of destruction: Just some of the destruction on West Florissant Avenue today 

From above: An aerial view of the destruction shows just what a scale it was on. Burned shops can be seen at the right of the picture, while a police roadblock in the front closes access to the 'crime scene'.

Still smoldering: The remains of a series of burned-out shops were still smoking on West Florissant Avenue today

Razed: One of the worst sites of destruction was at the intersection of West Florissant Avenue, Ferguson's main thoroughfare, and Chambers Road, where an entire strip of seven shops was attacked, with Prime Beauty destroyed completely

Aftermath: A firefighter at work at Prime Beauty in the early hours of this morning immediately after it was set ablaze

After - and before: Prime Beauty this morning (left) and as it was as before Ferguson was engulfed in violence 

Smashed: The rest of the seven-shop strip on West Florissant and Chambers, which was systematically torn apart

Devastated: The distraught owner of Queen's Royal Touch hair salon arrived at work to find his business destroyed

The roof sagged to the ground in the middle and at the front the wall had given way and fallen in on itself.

Eerily the sign 'Prime Beauty' lay intact on the floor at the front of the heap of steaming, smoking rubble.

Next door at the Clean World Laundromat the windows had been smashed and the front door had been broken.

Inside glass was all over the floor and water covered the floor. The smell of smoke hung in the air and the looters had mindlessly torn off the front of one of the washing machines.

The On On Chop Suey Chinese restaurant had also been broken into and the glass front door ripped open but with nothing to steal the rioters had just destroyed it and left.

A tax office next to that had been completely cleared out of furniture with just a few chairs left inside.

The owner of Queen's Royal Touch beauty salon was too upset to comment. His windows had been smashed and many of the products on the shelves had been stolen.

With tears in his eyes, he said: 'There's a time for talking and it isn't now. We just have to rebuild'.

Residents stood and wept as they walked out of their homes and made their way across the street to look at the wreckage on their doorstep.

Teacher Annie Chalk, 55, said: 'Prime Beauty had been here for about 20 years and I used to go there all the time.

'That Chinese restaurant had the best fries around here.

'The laundromat was always busy. These were good community stores. You had to wait two hours to go to the nail salon it was that popular.

'There was always something going on. Where are people going to go now?'

Further down West Florissant Avenue the entire block between Chambers Street and Solway Avenue looked like a scene from an urban nightmare - or a warzone.

All the shops that were not boarded up had broken windows.

Laughing: Local Kode Palmer poses with a bottle of wine and the cans of beer left in a cart outside the shops which had been looted, to have his picture taken by Chivas Johnson. Both men said they had not been involved in the looting last night

Remains: This looted alcohol (left) was left behind by the mob outside the burned out JC Wireless building (right)

The JC Wireless and Beauty Town building on West Florissant Avenue this morning: the entire block was burned out

The Public Storage facility had been badly burned and was still smoking.

The McDonald's restaurant - which had sheltered many protesters during the unrest in August - had its windows smashed and glass was all over the tables and chairs.

Two shops in the same building - JC Wireless and Beauty Town - were completely gutted by fire and the roof had collapsed, leaving the air conditioning unit laying on top of the remains.

White singed bricks were strewn into the street and the back room had become a mass of mangled, charred metal.

Flames were still licking the top of the remaining walls and a trolley full of beers stood out the back which looters had been stealing but left behind.

Chivas Johnson chuckled as he took a picture of his friend Kode Palmer as he held up a beer from the trolley.

Destruction: :A rioter uses a stick to break a window at the Hunan Chop Suey Chinese Restaurant along West Florissant Ave last night

Nothing left: This was all that was left of the Hunan Chop Suey Chinese restaurant this morning after the fire wrecked it 

Picture: 'I don't condone this but I can understand it. I have been racially profiled myself,' said Jason Westbrook of Ferguson as he took video of the burning of the Title Max Loans business on West Florissant

As they were: The Hunan Chop Suey and TitleMax loans were both intact before last night's orgy of violence

Burning: Cars parked outside one row of shops on West Florissant were targeted in the destruction spree

Burned out: Cars parked outside one row of shops on West Florissant were targeted in the destruction spree 

Inspection: The scale of destruction became clear today after a night which saw fires raised across the St Louis suburb of Ferguson

Attacked: McDonald's on West Florissant was smashed up although not set on fire. It had previously (right) avoided damage 

Devastated: A gas station was among the targets of the violence. Today property manager Terri Willits witnessed the destruction

Crime scene: Much of West Florissant was under police guard today and described by officers as an active crime scene

Both men, in their 20s, denied having been out during the riot the night before but said they had been out in August during the protests then.

Johnson said that the violence but 'good for the pictures but bad for us'. He accused the police of being 'neo Nazis'.

But he also joked about the trolley of beers and said: 'It's like, do you want a beer?' before laughing again.

Police refused to let reporters walk along West Florissant Avenue and told them: 'This is still an active crime scene'.

Across Ferguson the community struggled to make sense of what had happened.

Interviewed on a local TV station a woman called Gayle, said: 'These places have been here for a long time - to tear up where you live, it doesn't make sense'.

A caller into a local radio station said: 'There was no peace last night. No peace'.

Residents on the streets told MailOnline that the wreckage to Ferguson was so bad that it looked like ‘Ferganistan’.

Another said that it ‘looked like Iraq’.

Almost every building along South Florissant Street, where the Ferguson police station is located, had been ransacked or vandalised.

Tony Koenig and his brother Ray, 38 and 40, had taken the day off from working as school groundskeepers to help rebuild a Mexican restaurant run by a friend.

Tony said: ‘I have lived in Ferguson for 38 years and I have never seen anything like this. They just want street justice and they don’t care about how they get it. 

‘This young generation. I cannot understand why they do what they do. The parents are to blame. When me and my brother grew up both our parents worked and we were raised knowing how to show respect, and that doesn’t happen these days.

‘We’ve had a hard enough time paying our mortgages after the economy went down. We don’t need this’.

Their friend Drew Canaday, who was also helping them, lives in the street next to South Florissant and said that it was ‘like a war’ the night before. 

More destruction: The arson frenzy also hit South Florissant Street, about a mile away. This branch of Little Casear's was burned out

Ashes: The Little Caesar's was left almost entirely destroyed today after the arsonists struck last night

Distraught: The manager of the Little Caesar's said he understood the protesters were angry but added: 'Speaking your mind - that’s America. You are supposed to be able to protest peacefully and make your point. But this...'

Et tu: The neighboring antique shop to the Little Caesar's was also destroyed in the orgy of violence which hit Ferguson

Overwhelmed: The antique shops was well alight before firefighters were able to finally bring it under control

He said: ‘These young people are so used to instant gratification, they want stuff now. They are too immature to understand that stuff takes time.

‘Especially something this big. It takes dialogue and not everyone will be happy but that’s compromise.

‘These people don’t want to wait. That what today’s society has come to, not just here in Ferguson - this is America, this is the world.’

Further up South Florissant a Little Caesar’s pizza restaurant had been burned to the ground, as had the antiques store next to it.

The manager of the restaurant, who declined to give his name for fear of reprisals, said that 12 people had now been put out of work and did not know if the owners would rebuild.

The manager said that the store was destroyed by a tornado three years earlier and they did build it back but it cost ‘a lot of money’.

He said: ‘Most of the people here have families and they are very worried about what will come next for them.

‘I’m proud to work here and started as the dishwasher and worked my way up. I had a motorcycle accident and had my foot amputated and they were good enough to give me a job,

The manger, a widower with two children in their 20s, said that he was in principle on the side of the protesters but that this was ‘too far’.

He said: ‘I believe in their right to protest and what they’re doing is a just case.

‘Speaking your mind - that’s America. You are supposed to be able to protest peacefully and make your point. But this...’
