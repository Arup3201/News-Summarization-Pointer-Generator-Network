The man who allegedly stabbed three soldiers outside a Jewish centre has been pictured for the first time - as his victims are honoured for their 'courage and devotion' to France.

Moussa Coulibally's face was captured on Turkish CCTV at Istanbul airport, as the would-be jihadist was deported from the country last week, after border agency staff became suspicious.

A source in the security service claims Coulibaly - who is no relation to Amedy Coulibaly, who took hostages in a kosher supermarket in Paris and gunned down a policewoman in January - was trying to reach Syria to join Isis.

Moussa Coulibaly, pictured at Istanbul airport last week, is suspected of stabbing three soldiers in Nice, France, on Tuesday afternoon 

The soldiers - Sergeant Jamel, Private First Class Herve and Private First Class Gabin - were guarding a Jewish centre in the city in the south of France

On Tuesday, he is alleged to have attacked three soliders, who were standing guard outside the centre, home to an Israeli association and a Jewish radio station, in Nice at about 2pm. 

Today, those soliders - some of the 10,000 deployed to defend sensitive locations around France in the wake of the massacres at the Charlie Hebdo offices and supermarket last month - were honoured  by the French government.

Sergeant Jamel, private first class Herve and private first class Gabin were awarded the Honour Medal for Courage and Devotion during a ceremony, a day after they were attacked near the Galeries Lafayette department store.

Meanwhile, Coulibaly is still being detained after the attack, near the Galeries Lafayette department store.

A second man has also been arrested by police.

Today, the three men were given medals to recognise their role. Pictured: Private First Class Gabin, who was hurt in the cheek, receives his medal

The soldiers were not seriously injured in the attack - although Sergeant Jamel, pictured centre with Adolphe Colrat (left), prefect of Alpes-Maritimes, next to Eric Ciotti (right), president of Alpes-Maritimes County Council, was hurt in the forearm

Coulibaly, who is from the poor western suburbs of Paris, had been questioned by French police when he first returned from Turkey.

He also came to the attention of authorities just before the attack, when he was fined for travelling on the tram without a ticket.

He quickly paid the fine - then pulled an eight-inch blade out of a bag and set upon one of the soldiers, injuring him in the chin, police said.

Coulibaly then swiped at two other soldiers - injuring one in the cheek, and the other in the forearm - before being apprehended by riot police stationed near the building. 

Today, soldiers were still out patrolling the calm streets of Nice - ready for any further attacks

It was a different scene yesterday, when police officers were looking for evidence in the wake of the attack (pictured)
