Bringing a baby into the world has to be a two-way street for modern mothers and fathers.

But one unfortunate couple found this to literally be the case when she was forced to give birth on the pavement in Guangzhou, capital of southeast China's Guangdong Province.

The couple were on their way to 
hospital when the woman suddenly collapsed and was 
overcome with the urge to push.

Hero husband: The couple were on their way to hospital when the woman suddenly collapsed on the pavement and was overcome with the urge to push.

When the baby began to crown with still a long way to go, they realised they had no choice but to deliver on the spot.

The husband immediately sought help from
a nearby dental clinic, but but the dentists inside told them 
delivering a baby had not been part of their medical training.

In a rush: The husband laid down some coats and sheets provided by local residents and delivered the baby himself

Success: The baby was born healthy before an ambulance finally arrived to take the young family to hospital.

So, while they waited for the ambulance, the husband acted as midwife and delivered the nipper himself with a dose of encouragement from passers by who gathered to watch the spectacle unfold.

The baby was born successfully and he and the mother were sent to hospital to get checked out.

An onlooker said: 'She was unable to hold the baby in any longer so her husband laid down his coat and some sheets that residents provided and did what he had to do.'
