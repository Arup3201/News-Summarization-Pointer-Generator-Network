When you're yearly take-home is $36.6 million, you can afford to tailor your life accordingly.

And such is the case this week for Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, who has bought a monumental funeral home near her house in what appears to be an attempt to stop developments going up around her.

Its a property move recently pulled by fellow internet boss, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, in the same area.

At 114 years old, the Roller & Hapgood & Tinney mortuary is Palo Alto's oldest funeral home after opening in 1951.

Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer is the rumored new owner of this funeral home, Roller & Hapgood & Tinney, in the exclusive suburb of Palo Alto in San Francisco Bay. Mayer is thought to have bought the home to stop it from being developed. It was recently approved as a site for 21 units

Roller & Hapgood & Tinney will close down for good on Thursday after 115 years. Set on beautiful grounds, it was sold for an unknown amount

A June 2, 2012, City of Palo Alto Regional Housing Mandate Committee staff report identified the site at 960 Middlefied Road as a potential site for 21 residences, according to the Palo Alto Online.

The property is 1.16 acres.

It is situated one block east of Mayer's Addison Avenue home.

It was recently zoned as Planned Community (PC), which allows for higher-density building in exchange for added public benefits.

The funeral home site is surrounded by multi-family residences, including the Webster Wood Apartments for low-income families.

Mayer could not be reached for comment regarding the purchase or her plans for the property.

Yahoo boss Marissa Mayer lives with her husband and young son in this nearby house, which has become known for its extravagant parties, much to the chagrin of neighbors

Marissa Mayer has become known for her parties. She also owns a penthouse atop the Four Seasons hotel in San Francisco, which has become something of a social hub among the tech world

The deal closed Oct. 7, according to Jim Spangler, president of Mountain View-based Spangler Mortuaries, which purchased Roller & Hapgood & Tinney's business assets.

He does not know what Mayer plans to do with the property, he said.

The funeral home will officially close on Oct. 31.

Mayer's current 5,600-square-foot home, on 0.3 acres, was the site of a Democratic fundraising dinner with President Barack Obama in October 2010.

Locals report that Mayer - who lives with husband Zachary Bogue and son McAllister - is an 'intrusive' neighbor because of the parties she throws and how they affect the surrounding houses.

Last year Mayer was ranked number 14 on the list of America's most powerful businesswomen of 2012 by Fortune magazine.

Mayer jumped to Yahoo from Google.

She is credited with creating the iconic Google homepage.

Doin' a Zuckerberg: Facebook billionaire Mark Zuckerberg has reportedly bought four of the five homes that surround his own (pictured) in Palo Alto to create a security/privacy buffer

Earlier this month it was revealed Facebook big shot Mark Zuckerberg had bought four of the five homes that surround his five-bedroom Palo Alto abode.

While Zuckerberg wasn't listed as the property owner, shell companies linked to his wealth management company were.

One of the homes cost $14.5 million.

Zuckerberg is thought to be creating a security buffer around his house.

There is talk he will knock the other houses and build one enormous compound on the land.
