It is a car which is synonymous with British culture and was even adored by James Bond.

But despite its unique and glowing reputation, the price-tag of this rare Aston Martin still comes as something of a shock.

This bright orange version of the luxury car has been described by experts as a 'masterpiece' and is expected to fetch a staggering £2.5 million when it goes under the hammer next month.

Rare: The stunning 1955 Aston Martin DB3S is one of just 21 built by the iconic British sports car maker

The stunning 1955 Aston Martin DB3S is one of just 21 built by the iconic British sports car maker.

It was bought new by a Dutch motorsport ace Hans Davids who raced it in England before the car was later shipped across the Atlantic to the USA.

Classic car enthusiasts regard the orange Aston Martin as 'one of the most attractive and elegantly designed sports racing cars of the post war period'.

It will go under the hammer at RM Auctions’ Monterey sale on August 17 with experts estimating it could fetch £2.5million.

This will make it one of the most expensive British cars ever sold publicly - putting it on a par with James Bond’s Aston Martin DB5 which fetched £2.6 million in 2010.

The elegantly designed sports car, which goes under the chassis number 118, is fitted with a 3-litre engine which develops around 210bhp.

RM Auctions has billed it as one of the most attractive post-war racing cars, calling it a 'masterpiece' of the then Aston Martin owner Sir David Brown’s vision.

Don Rose, RM Car Specialist, said: 'Aston made very few sports racers in their storied history, with a mere 21 DB3S models available to privateers.

'DB3S/118 is among the best of the examples extant, with a fully documented race and ownership history and a factory engine upgrade to the "Works competition" twin-plug head specification in its first year and which is still retains today.

'An important and fascinating car, you will not see another one in its brilliant orange Dutch national racing livery, as it was when it took first place at its native Zandvoort circuit two years running.'

Rob Myers, Chairman & Founder, RM Auctions, called the Aston a 'fantastic car with great history'.
