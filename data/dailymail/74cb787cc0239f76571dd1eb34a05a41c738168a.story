Lindsi Bluemel was out riding in Bournemouth yesterday morning when her bike ran over the strip of UPVC plastic lying across the cycle lane

A cycling safety campaigner is fighting for life after coming off her bicyle in a freak accident just days after her helmet was stolen.

Lindsi Bluemel, chairwoman of Southampton Cycling Campaign, was out cycling without a helmet and came off when her bike clipped a 16ft-long piece of plastic lying in the cycling lane on a dual carriageway.

She struck her unprotected head on the concrete and suffered serious injuries.

Mrs Bluemel, 56, from Southampton, Hants, was given first aid at the scene before being taken to hospital by ambulance.

Her condition was today described as 'critical but stable'.

Police investigating the incident along the A338 in Bournemouth, Dorset, said her cycle helmet had been stolen a few days ago and she had not yet got around to replacing it.

Mrs Bluemel is a vocal advocate of safer cycle lanes and has campaigned to get more people on their bikes.

She was out riding in Bournemouth yesterday morning when her bike ran over the strip of UPVC plastic lying across the cycle lane.

Her bike was seen to wobble suddenly, with the back wheel sliding out from under Mrs Bluemel.

Witnesses stopped and rushed to help her as she lay in the road, administering first aid until an ambulance arrived.

She was taken to Poole Hospital with life-threatening head injuries.Police closed the road for two hours while they investigated the incident and are now urging witnesses to contact them.

A spokesman for Dorset Police said: 'At about 9.15am on Sunday a serious injury accident occured on the A338 Wessex Way.
