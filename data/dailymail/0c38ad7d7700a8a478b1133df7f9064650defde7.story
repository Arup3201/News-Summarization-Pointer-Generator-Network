One of the most anticipated 'coming out' moments was when Australian swimming legend Ian Thorpe revealed he was gay in a paid interview and now it's being celebrated despite the move dividing the homoseuxal community.

The interview by British journalist Michael Parkinson, which was reported to have seen the Olympian pocket up to $500,000, has been nominated for a media award at this year's Honour Awards which recognises achievements within NSW’s lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) community.

The public revelation made global headlines while polarising the LGBTI community with some believing that the 31-year-old should have felt comfortable in living an open gay life much earlier.

However, Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby convenor Justin Koonin said acknowledgement of the exclusive interview was a positive recognition.

'It's appropriate to recognise what the interview did and we were extremely supportive of what Ian did,' he said. 

'It's a measure of how far we have come that he has come out but it's also a measure of how far we have to go that it' s a media story.'

Mr Koonin said it was particularly hard for male athletes to deal with their sexuality.

'We would never say that a sportsperson has to come out, or any individual, and certainly we understand the pressures on athletes given his particular role in Australian sport and culture,' he said. 

'Things are changing but at the moment the number of openly out male athletes is very small.' 

The Olympian was reported to have pocketed up to $500,000 for the tell-all

Thorpe admitted to considering coming out at the Sydney Pympics in 2000 in the interview
