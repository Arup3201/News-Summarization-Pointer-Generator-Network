For Gary Lineker, the greatest player in the history of the game is Diego Maradona. ‘By a million miles the best I played with or against,’ is the emphatic verdict.

Argentina’s run to the final has jogged memories of Maradona’s magical influence on the 1986 and 1990 World Cups. He controlled the tournaments.

It is here then, in the grand setting of Rio de Janeiro, where Lionel Messi must come to life if Argentina are to win the World Cup for a third time.

‘I can see the comparisons with Maradona,’ admitted Lineker. ‘He is a god in Argentina, understandably. He is a tough act to follow and has always been a huge personality.

‘His left foot could manipulate the ball as though it was a hand. He was astonishing.’

Despite Messi’s standing within the game, he has looked subdued and isolated at times. In a workmanlike, industrious team, he is expected to turn games.

He has scored four goals - including a special strike against Iran - but they have largely been forgotten in the final week of the tournament.

Lineker, who scored against Argentina in the 1986 World Cup, added: ‘I love Messi. He is the most wonderfully gifted player I have seen since Maradona, but he looks jaded. Let’s see if he can do it in the final.

‘I’ve watched him at Barcelona and there was less and less movement as the season progressed. I don’t think he is in brilliant shape and he looks exhausted. To be honest I have been marginally disappointed with him - something is not right.’

Lineker was unimpressed with Messi’s work-rate during Argentina’s semi-final against Holland.

He added: ‘I know in all the games teams have put players on him but he has done so little to create space for himself. Every now and then he will light the place up, get the ball and beat three men but you have to wait a long time for that.

‘I have watched him for years and he scores a lot of poacher’s goals, but on the occasions Argentina did counter attack down the flanks, with Lavezzi or Zabaleta or whoever it was, he didn’t even try to get anywhere near the box. 

‘I don’t think in 120 minutes he touched the ball in the box. I saw a quote from his father saying he’s exhausted and his legs weigh 100kgs. It looks a bit like that.’

Messi’s goals got Argentina out the group, but he has yet to control the tournament in the same way as Maradona.

Lineker added: ‘They might have struggled to get through the group without some Messi magic. He got them through, in all ways.

‘Then there was the brilliant bit of play for Di Maria to get the winner in the last 16 against Switzerland. 

‘He’s been massively influential. They wouldn’t be where they are without him, or without Mascherano either.’

To prevent Germany winning their fourth World Cup, Argentina must restrain the midfield three of Bastian Schweinsteiger, Toni Kroos and Sami Khedira.

The former England man said: ‘The Germany-Brazil game was the most amazing, remarkable match I have ever seen. The thing about them is that they are a team and they are very strong.

Trio: Germany's midfield three, which includes Bastian Schweinsteiger, destroyed Brazil during the semi-final

Stellar: Sami Khedira was also brilliant as Germany destroyed hosts Brazil 7-1 to reach the final

Brilliant: Toni Kroos excelled during Germany's semi-final demolition of Brazil, scoring twice

Position: Germany's decision to shift Philipp Lahm back to full-back has benefited the side

Unusual: Germany forward Thomas Muller has a unique style but is extremely effective

Messi must reach new heights if Argentina are to beat Germany in Sunday's World Cup final

‘Schweinsteiger is important, Kroos has had a lot of stick in Germany but he has come through.

‘I also like Muller. He is a funny looking footballer, slightly ungainly, he falls over a bit and yet he sees things and he is a wonderful finisher.

‘The best thing that happened to them was shifting Lahm to full back. I don’t think he is a defensive midfielder - he is a bit ill-disciplined. They got away with it against the (United) States and Ghana. Whereas Khedira is not as a good a footballer as Lahm, he is very good in the position.

‘Their high line is the only risk, but Argentina don’t have runners in there. Mascherano is as good a holding player as you will ever see. His performance in the semi final was epic.’
