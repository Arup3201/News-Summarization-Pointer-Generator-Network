A council has been slapped down by health and safety chiefs after it refused to clear up dog mess in a playground because of the risk it posed to workers.

Officials at Trafford, Greater Manchester, had said that telling groundsmen to clear faeces from the play area in Altrincham, a well-to-do suburb, could expose them to disease.

Parents who asked the council to take action over the mess were told: 'Unfortunately, the Council's grounds maintenance team are not allowed to tackle dog fouling by hand (including spades) for health and safety reasons.'

Furious at the refusal, the parents complained to the Health and Safety Executive's Mythbusters Panel, which ruled that Trafford had used an 'unjustified health and safety reason for not clearing up the dog fouling.'

HSE chairman Judith Hackitt, who heads the Mythbusters Panel, said that it was 'right and proper' that council workers should clean up the playground to protect children from the potentially hazardous waste.

'There are no rules which prevent this and the precautions needed to protect workers are simple and straightforward,' she told The Sun.

'Refusing to clean up is just unhelpful.'

Andrew Caine, a father who was among the parents who brought the complaint against Trafford, said that council officials had agreed to build a wall around the playground to stop dogs coming in and using it as a toilet.

He said he was satisfied with the decision and would not take the complaint any further.

The HSE's Mythbusters Panel challenges the incorrect use of health and safety rules. It said in its decision: 'In this case those most at risk from the behaviour of irresponsible dog owners are children.

'The Council is right to encourage owners to clean up after their dogs â€“ and the steps they are taking to keep dogs out of the play area are sensible.

'However, saying that their staff cannot clear up the mess for health and safety reasons is incorrect. Any risks to adults from clearing up after dogs can be easily managed by simple precautions and good hygiene.'

Mike Penning, the Welfare Minister, who is also in charge of health and safety, said he had personally written to Trafford to correct them on their misuse of the rules.

He said there were no rules to stop council staff clearing up dog mess, adding: 'In fact, the risks to children of leaving dog mess, including spreading disease and causing blindness, far outweigh the costs of cleaning it up.'
