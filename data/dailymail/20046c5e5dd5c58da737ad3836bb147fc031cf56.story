A talented writer, keen cook, and a doting mother-of-two, Sophie Dahl is back in the very first role that found her fame in a new campaign for Debenhams.

The 37-year-old British blonde channels grown-up glamour in her first high-profile modelling job in years as the face and body of the Principles Weekend by Ben de Lisi brand. 

Marking a comeback into the world of fashion for Sophie, the first imagery to drop from her venture with the High Street retailer oozes relaxed sophistication.

Modelling for Debenhams marks a comeback into the world of fashion for Sophie

She was catapulted into the limelight after being discovered by Isabella Blow almost 20 years ago when she was just 18.

Sophie went on to front campaigns for Versace, Alexander McQueen and YSL before taking a step back to focus on writing, cooking and motherhood.

But she's now back as the face of one of Britain's best loved brands. 

It the new photos Sophie's hair is styled into a honey blonde highlighted relaxed bob and her make-up is fresh and feminine albeit a slightly smokey eye. 

The London-born model, who has written extensively for Vogue and authored two books, exudes the beauty of a young Debbie Harry with her still-razor sharp bone structure.

Sophie, who has two daughters with her husband of five years, jazz singer Jamie Cullum, says: 'The collection is all about ease - for the shoot we really mixed and matched it, in a way that felt true to the way I dress.'

The mother to Lyra, three, and Margot, who turns two next month, adds: 'Within this collection there are some gorgeous muted pastels, soft slouchy trousers and grown-up "meet the parents" dresses. 

'A weekend bag packed for many an eventuality.'
