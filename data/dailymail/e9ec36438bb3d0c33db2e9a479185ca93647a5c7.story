A teenager considered by authorities to be one of the most prolific drug dealers in the Cincinnati area was sentenced on Monday to between six months and three years in a juvenile prison after a judge told the teen he was 'a pretty fine young person that went down a bad trail'.

Tyler Pagenstecher, 18, of Mason, Ohio, was taken into custody immediately after the hearing and will be turned over to Ohio's Department of Youth Services. The agency ultimately will decide how long Pagenstecher will be in prison, depending on his behavior.

'He's not going home today,' Judge Thomas Lipps said, explaining that the charges against Pagenstecher were too serious for him to avoid prison time.

Authorities say Pagenstecher began selling drugs when he was at least 15 and managed to stay under the radar by selling pot out of his home - a two-story, white-brick house on a spacious corner lot

Lipps handed the sentence down after 
Pagenstecher stood up in court and apologized for what he did, saying 
that he didn't realize the severity of his actions.

'I
understood that I would get in trouble but not to the level or extent 
this has become, and I sincerely regret all of this,' said the pale, 
bespectacled, soft-spoken teen. 'If I could take it all back, I would.'

Authorities
accused Pagenstecher, who turned 18 earlier this month, of playing a 
major role in a drug ring that sold as much as $20,000 worth of 
high-grade marijuana a month to fellow students in and around his 
well-to-do suburb.

Authorities
say they believe Pagenstecher began selling the drugs when he was at 
least 15 and managed to stay under authorities' radar for a long time by
not selling pot at school, but largely out of his home - a two-story, 
white-brick house on a spacious corner lot where he lived with his 
single mother and older brother.

Investigators
said they found no evidence that Daffney Pagenstecher, a 50-year-old 
school bus driver, knew what her son was up to.

Daffney
Pagenstecher, who dabbed her eyes during the sentencing, and defense 
attorney Mike O'Neill, both declined to comment after the hearing on 
Monday.

During the 
hearing, O'Neill minimized Pagenstecher's actions and pointed out that 
he had no weapons or wasn't involved in any violence.

'We
have a high school child here who was using a lot of marijuana and was 
selling marijuana to his friends,' O'Neill said, adding that intense 
media coverage of the case will affect him for the rest of his life.

He added that Pagenstecher completed 
an 'intensive' drug abuse program, is sorry for his actions, cooperated 
with authorities and didn't have a serious criminal history.

He will have to stay behind bars until he is at least 21 years old.

'This is a kid with some potential,' O'Neill said. 'He can go on and do something with his life.'

On January 12, authorities raided the house and confiscated pot, scales, a bong and a box of cash, according to WKRC-TV.

According to court documents, the raid on Pagenstecher's house followed a series of undercover buys which started with the teen selling an ounce of high grade pot to an agent on August 5.

Two other buys were made in August and agents bought more at Pagenstecher's house in November, and again two days before searching the place in January.

Authorities
said that Pagenstecher took orders from adults who led the drug ring, 
but was in charge of six teenage lieutenants who helped sell the pot.

Seven
adults, ages 20 to 58, also were arrested and were accused of growing 
the pot under artificial lights in a furniture warehouse and two 
suburban homes.

Four of
the adults have pleaded not guilty to charges of drug trafficking and 
possession, marijuana cultivation and engaging in corrupt activity, and 
are set for trial in November and December.

Three of the adults agreed to plead guilty to some of the charges in order to get other charges dropped.

One of them, 31-year-old Stacy Lampe, was sentenced to two years in prison. The other two are set to be sentenced by the end of the year and also face years in prison.

As part of its investigation of the drug ring, the Warren County Drug Task Force seized more than 600 marijuana plants with an estimated street value of $3 million, or $5,000 a pound. Investigators also found $6,000 in cash in Pagenstecher's bedroom.

Task force Cmdr John Burke has called Pagenstecher a 'little czar' in the drug ring and said that most of his customers were students at Mason High and Kings High, two highly ranked public schools about 20 miles outside Cincinnati.

Friends and neighbors have described Pagenstecher as a seemingly typical teenager who liked to ride skateboards and bikes, and usually got As and Bs.
