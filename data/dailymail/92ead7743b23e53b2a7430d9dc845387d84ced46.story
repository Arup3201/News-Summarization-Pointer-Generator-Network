Passengers were left stranded on a plane for more than seven hours after fog caused huge disruption to flights.

The British Airways flight was due to leave Copenhagen, Denmark, at 10.15am UK time and the one and a half hour flight would have meant passengers should have touched down in the UK at about 11.45am.

After the travellers boarded the plane, they sat on the tarmac for three hours because of the adverse weather conditions.

Wrong airport: The BA flight to Heathrow was eventually forced to land at Manston Airport in Kent

Torchlight: Travellers were shown off the plane by torchlight and then ushered onto a bus or offered hotel accommodation for the night

Diverted: It was eventually forced to land at Manston Airport in Kent but the nightmare for passengers didn¿t end there as they were not allowed off the plane

It eventually took off from the Danish capital, at 1.24pm UK time but when it tried to land at Heathrow, there were more problems.

After circling the airport for 40 minutes, the passengers were told their landing slot was in three hours’ time but there wasn’t enough fuel for the plane to keep circling.

It was eventually forced to land at Manston Airport in Kent but the nightmare for passengers didn’t end there as they were not allowed off the plane because there were no BA staff there. 

Food on the aircraft ran out and the staff stopped serving drinks as the passengers were held on board.

One 28-year-old woman was returning from a business trip. 

Tweets: Frustrated tweeter Lady Neemo took to the social networking site to vent her anger

She said: ‘It is really frustrating. A lot of people missed appointments, there are people who had to rearrange people picking up their children, someone missed a wedding. It is shambolic.

‘We sat on the ground for two hours at Manston and we ran out of food. They stopped offering drinks but we were not allowed off the plane.

‘There has been no information about forward travel arrangements from Manston and we have been told our luggage is going to Heathrow.’

The management consultant took to Twitter, using the hashtag #letmeoffthisplane, to vent her frustrations at being held on the flight. 

‘I was meant to be at work at about 
midday,’ she added, ‘It is an absolutely full flight. Knowing there 
would be some delays, why didn’t they plan in advance?’

Passengers were taken off the flight at Manston and told they could either stay in a hotel overnight and then fly to Heathrow in the morning or carry on their journey by land and then make claims against the company.

The plane had to stay at Manston due to the fog and air traffic control conditions. Passengers were taken off the plane in batches of 20 and say the captain had to show them down onto the tarmac by torchlight.

They were then taken by bus to London or offered hotel accommodation.

A spokesman for British Airways said: 'As a result of thick fog at Heathrow, Gatwick and London City airports, Air Traffic Control has imposed safety restrictions on how many aircraft can land at the airport each hour.

'We are therefore experiencing some delays to services.

'We are sorry for the inconvenience caused by the poor weather, We are all doing all we can to rebook customers whose flights have been cancelled or giving them full refunds.

'Due to the thick fog at Heathrow the BA813 flight from Copenhagen to Heathrow had to divert to Manston airport and will continue its flight to Heathrow tomorrow morning.

'We are sorry for the inconvenience and our crew cared for our customers who have been offered options including overnight hotel accommodation before flying to Heathrow in the morning or continuing their journey using ground transport and making individual claims to the company.'
