The Grand Canyon is beautiful all-year round.

Right now a light dust of snow has settled in the deep ravines of the iconic Arizona national park.

And an astronaut working out of the International Space Station has managed to take a photo of just that from low Earth orbit. 

Ever wondered what the Grand Canyon looks like from space? Here you have it. Astronaut Terry W. Virts tweeted this picture Friday from the International Space Station

Astronaut Terry W. Virts tweeted the stunning picture on Friday.

His caption of 'wow' pretty much sums it up.

According to local station ABC 15, much of the desert state will be seeing close to freezing temperatures this weekend.

Southern Arizona and parts of the Valley have expected temperatures in the 20s and 30s set for Saturday and Sunday.
