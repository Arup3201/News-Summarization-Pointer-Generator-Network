A Washington State judge doled out the maximum sentence of 18 years in prison to the man convicted of killing his wife in 2006 because he was bored with their sex life.

36-year-old David Pietz was found guilty of second degree murder of his 32-year-old wife Nicole last month.

In his decision this morning, Judge Michael Hayden explained that he went with the maximum sentence since this was a 'close, personal and most aggravated' murder.

Two decades for you: 36-year-old David Pietz was sentenced to 18 years in prison on Thursday for killing his wife Nicole in 2006 after he grew tired of their sex life

Day in court: The judge explained his maximum sentencing, saying that it was a 'close, personal and most aggravated' murder

'She was able to look into your eyes when you did it,' he said.

While Pietz was always the prime suspect in his wife's murder, he wasn't arrested until last year when foresic technology advanced to the point where they had enough evidence to arrest him.

January 28, 2006: Nicole Pietz, 32, reported missing by her husbandFebruary 6, 2006: Her naked body found in the woods near Burien, WashingtonFebruary 12, 2006: Memorial service held for Nicole PietzMarch 2012: David Pietz arrested and charged with second-degree murderSeptember 12, 2013: Murder trial begins in SeattleOctober 8, 2013: Defense and prosecution rest their casesOctober 14, 2013: Jury reaches guilty verdict

'I guess you're not quite as smart as you throught you were,' Judge Hayden said.

Over the years, Nicole's mother Gael Schneider has been the main advocate for bringing Pietz to justice.

But this morning, when she was finally allowed to say her peace to Pietz, she chose to forgive him.

'I've let David take my life for the last seven and a half years, but I'm not going to anymore. David, I forgive you,' she said.

Pietz's parents also got an opportunity to address their son in court today.

'As his father, I love and support him. THe entire situation has been absolutely a horrible shock to us and an extremely difficult time,' his father Martin Pietz said. His mother Sandy Pietz said she still loved her son 'with all my heart'.

During the trial, prosecutors said Pietz tried to cover up his wife's death by reporting her missing. Her nude body was found about a week later.

Pietz was arrested in March 2012 by cold case detectives who had spent six years building a case against him based largely on circumstantial evidence.

Mr Pietz told police that on January 27, 2006, he got home from work around midnight and briefly said goodnight to his wife, who was already sleeping, KOMO reported after his arrest.

The next morning he said left for work at 8.30am without speaking to Nicole and had no contact with her throughout the day.

Mr Pietz told police that he called 911 when he went straight to a planned dinner with friends that night and his wife never arrived.

He claims that she must have vanished as she headed to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting that morning where she was going to celebrate 8 years of sobriety. He claimed that he believed she had fallen back into her old drug habit.

However, police said that forensic tests - including undigested food in her stomach - showed that Mrs Pietz had been killed around midnight on January 27.

Loss: Investigators believe the couple was having marital problems and that Mr Pietz had cheated on his wife

Scene: Her body was found in a wooded area in 2006. Police said evidence suggested she had been killed at night - not in the day as Pietz suggested - as she still had her night mouth guard in

Search: Investigators search their home after the disappearance and remove their computer

When her body was found, she was wearing a mouth guard she only wore at night and her wedding ring was in cleaning solution in the bathroom; friends said she only took it off at night to clean it.

Phone records also show her phone was allegedly used at her husband's workplace.

And DNA evidence showed that Mr Pietz's was the last person to drive her car, which was found two weeks after her body in a parking lot near the University of Washington.

Prosecutor Kristen Richardson later told the press that in the end, the case hinged on minor clues, including Pietz's alleged affairs with at least four different woman and his wife's mouthguard, which she was wearing when her naked body was found in a wooded area near Burien, The Seattle Times reported.

During closing arguments, Richardson told the 12 members of the jury panel that Pietz had grown tired of being married to Nicole because of her reluctance to pursue a more adventurous sex life, and was 'cold and callous.’

Cover? in 2006, Pietz had appeared on television beside Schneider pleading for information in the case

In the course of the trial, four women testified they had sexual relations with Pietz while he was married to Nicole.

One of the husband's alleged lovers told the court that the 36-year-old defendant regularly spiked his wife's drinks with ecstasy to get her to take part in threesomes.

When he was found guilty earlier this month, Pietz showed little sign of emotion while the rest of the courthouse ran high on emotion.

Nicole Pietz's sister Tonia Zurcher yelled out, 'You're going to burn in hell, Pietz,' as he was led out of the courtroom following his conviction.

‘I just wanted justice for my daughter and we got it,’ said Nicole’s mother, Gael Schneider. ‘These last 7 1/2 years have been torture for us.’

Pietz will likely spend 16 years in prison counting the time he has already served during the trial.
