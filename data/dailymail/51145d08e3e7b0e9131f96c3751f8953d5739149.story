A Hong Kong billionaire who promised £80million in 'dowry' to the man who could win the affections of his lesbian daughter has withdrawn his offer.

Cecil Chao Sze-tsung, a 77-year-old property magnate sparked global controversy in 2012 when, refusing to accept his daughter Gigi's civil union to her lesbian partner of eight years, he offered 500 million Hong kong dollars to the man who could convince her to marry him.

He then doubled it recently, insisting that Gigi was 'still single', despite the fact that she married her long-term partner Sean Eav two years ago.

Happy couple: Gigi, right, asks her father to 'not be terrified' of her partner Sean, left, whom she married in a civil ceremony two years ago, and to 'treat her like a dignified human being'

His 34-year-old daughter initially laughed it off, but last week she went public with her plea for him to understand that she is gay, and that if it is as easy as he thinks to change her sexual orientation, he should lead by example.

Now the father of three has taken his offer off the table and said the money is 'staying in his pocket.'

'If Gigi's said that this is what she chooses, then it's all over,' Cecil Chao said Thursday an interview with CNN.

'I can't say I am happy with her choice,' he said. 'If this is her choice then it's for her.'

But said he will not be accepting his daughter's partner into his family. 

'I have no intention of mixing my life with her life,' Cecil Chao said. 'But if this is what she wants, then I respect her choice.'

In denial: Hong Kong billionaire Mr Chao, who claims to have slept with 10,000 women, still wants his daughter to marry a man - although he won't force her

Following the publication of an open 
letter to her father, Ms Chao said she will enter a straight marriage, 
when her father enters a gay one.

'Since
 Dad thinks it's so easy for me to switch from gay to straight, I should
 just leave it for him to demonstrate. I think I'll marry a man when he 
marries a man,' she told The Times.

In the letter published by South China Morning Post, Ms Chao reaches out to her father, asking for him to come to terms with the fact that she is a lesbian.

In
 the letter, which starts 'Dear Daddy', Ms Chao explains that although 
her love for him has not changed, the time has come for her father to 
accept her sexual orientation and her partner, Sean Eav, whom she has 
been with for nine years.

Deal: Ms Chao offered to comply with the terms, as long as the man in question donated a large part of the 'reward' to her charity, and did not mind that she already has a wife

'I must have misled you to hope there were other options for me,' she writes.

'I know it’s difficult for you to understand how I could feel romantically attracted to a woman; I suppose I can’t really explain it either. It just happens, peacefully and gently, and after so many years, we still love each other very much.

'Now, I’m not asking you to be best of friends; however, it would mean the world to me if you could just not be so terrified of her [partner Sean Eav], and treat her like a normal, dignified human being.I understand it is difficult for you to understand, let alone accept this truth.'

'I’ve spent a lot of time figuring out who I am, what is important in my life, who I love and how best to live life, as an expression of all these questions.

'I am proud of my life, and I would not choose to live it any other way (except also figuring out how to be gentler on the planet).

'I’m sorry to mislead you to think I was only in a lesbian relationship because there was a shortage of good, suitable men in Hong Kong.

'There are plenty of good men, they are just not for me.'

VIDEO: Gigi reads some of her marriage proposals... yes, she's still close with her father... 

Ms Chao married her long-term partner 
Sean in a church ceremony in Paris in early 2012, but it was not 
until news of their union was printed in the Hong Kong tabloids that her
 father promised the million HKD fortune to any potential male suitor 
able to walk Gigi down the aisle.

Ms Chao had already told her father about
 her wedding, and said he was ‘surprised and unpleasantly shocked,’ but 
urged her not to make it public.

When the plea for a man for Gigi spread over the world, the offers came pouring in.

‘War veterans from the US, someone 
from Ethiopia, from Istanbul, South America, Portugal, really just from 
all over the world,’ Ms Chao said.

'One American suitor wrote: "I’m interested in the offer. I am a male person, who also happens to be gay".'

Ms Chao, an executive director at her father’s 
property development company, part-time pilot, and founder of anti-poverty charity Faith 
in Love Foundation, has maintained throughout her father's persistent 
quest that she knows he is only doing it out of love and concern.

'I 
understand that he loves me, it’s just he’s from another time and it’s 
difficult for him to understand the plight of the LGBT.

'At the office 
it’s business as usual. At family gatherings we hug and dance. And we 
just agree to disagree on what marriage is and family is.'

Dear Daddy,

I thought the timing was right for us to have a candid conversation.

You are one of the most mentally astute, energetic yet well mannered and hard-working people this humble earth has ever known.

Your confidence, quick wit, and charisma brightens any room you enter.

I love you very much, and I think I can speak for my brothers also, that we have the utmost respect for you as a father and role model in business.

I am sorry that people have been saying insensitive things about you lately. The truth is, they don’t understand that I will always forgive you for thinking the way you do, because I know you think you are acting in my best interests. And we both don’t care if anybody else understands.

As your daughter, I would want nothing more than to make you happy. But in terms of relationships, your expectations of me and the reality of who I am, are not coherent.

I am responsible for some of this misplaced expectation, because I must have misled you to hope there were other options for me. You know I’ve had male lovers in the past, and I’ve had happy, albeit short-lived, relationships. I found myself temporarily happy, buoyed by the freshness, the attention, the interest, of someone physically stronger than myself.

But it was always short-lived, as I quickly lost patience, and felt an indescribable discomfort in their presence. It usually made me frustrated, and I would yearn for my freedom again. I’ve broken a few hearts, hearts of good, honest and loving men, and I’m sorry that it had to be so.

But with Sean, a woman, somehow it was different. I am comfortable and satisfied with my life and completely at ease with her. I know it’s difficult for you to understand how I could feel romantically attracted to a woman; I suppose I can’t really explain it either. It just happens, peacefully and gently, and after so many years, we still love each other very much.

My regret is that you have no idea how happy I am with my life, and there are aspects of my life that you don’t share. I suppose we don’t need each other’s approval for our romantic relationships, and I am sure your relationships are really fantastic too.

However, I do love my partner Sean, who does a good job of looking after me, ensuring I am fed, bathed and warm enough every day, and generally cheering me up to be a happy, jolly girl. She is a large part of my life, and I am a better person because of her.

Now, I’m not asking you to be best of friends; however, it would mean the world to me if you could just not be so terrified of her, and treat her like a normal, dignified human being.I understand it is difficult for you to understand, let alone accept this truth.

I’ve spent a lot of time figuring out who I am, what is important in my life, who I love and how best to live life, as an expression of all these questions. I am proud of my life, and I would not choose to live it any other way (except also figuring out how to be gentler on the planet).

I’m sorry to mislead you to think I was only in a lesbian relationship because there was a shortage of good, suitable men in Hong Kong.

There are plenty of good men, they are just not for me.

Wishing you happiness.

Patiently yours,

Your daughter, Gigi.
