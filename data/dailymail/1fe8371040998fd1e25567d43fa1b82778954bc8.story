A hero war veteran was left in agony with a broken back after being kept waiting for almost 20 hours in A&E, his daughter claims.

Yvonne Ingley says that despite her father Bill Smith screaming in pain, staff at Burton's Queen's Hospital gave the 87-year-old no treatment at all for three hours.

The father-of-eight, who served as a paratrooper during the Second World War, had suffered a fractured vertebrae in a fall at his home in Staffordshire on July 10th.

Bill Smith, pictured, an 87-year-old war veteran, was forced to wait almost 20 hours in A&E according to his daughter

He was discovered by his 63-year-old daughter who has slammed the hospital's treatment of her father.

She said: 'My dad was in agony, he was screaming out in pain. We got to hospital at about 1.30am and he was given no pain relief until about 4am.

'My dad had a broken back, usually the older generation don't like to fuss about pain and he is a former paratrooper, but he was genuinely in agony.

'During all this time my father was left in the A&E waiting area, they decided to send him to the Hillfield Care Home in Stretton but he was not taken there until about 7pm.

'The care home said it could not take him because of his fractured spine.

'My dad then had to be taken back to hospital and re-admitted.'

The 63-year-old added that despite the long wait in A&E, she did not blame medical staff at the Burton Hospital for her father's treatment.

She said: 'I had no complaint with the doctors and nurses but it's obvious someone somewhere is not organising things properly.'

The elderly war veteran waited until 11am - nine-and-a-half hours after being admitted - to be assessed by a physiotherapist.

And finally, almost twelve hours later, she was told her father would be taken to a care home in Stretton, Staffordshire to recover.

The ordeal was not over there, however, as the 87-year-old was taken back to the hospital after a transport mix-up.

Bill Smith's daughter claims that the 87-year-old pensioner was left waiting in agony in A&E at the Burton Hospital after suffering a broken back in a fall at his home

An ambulance carrying her dad arrived at the care home only to be told they couldn't take him because he wasn't mobile.

She said when she heard her dad had gone back to hospital she rushed down there only to discover he had been put to the back of the waiting list.

Mr Smith fought at the Battle of Monte Cassino during the war in his role as a paratrooper.

His daughter claims that the pensioner suffered greatly because of his lengthy wait.

Ms Ingley also believes that as well as the wait he endured in the A&E department he could have been laying undiscovered for at least an hour before she called round to his house to check on him.

She said: 'He was distressed because he was in pain and my sisters and I were distressed to see him in that state.'

Helen Ashley, Chief Executive of Burton Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'We are aware of the concerns of Mr Smith’s family and we can confirm that Mr Smith did attend the Trust’s A & E Department.

'However, he was transferred in a timely manner to the Clinical Decisions Unit (CDU).

'A CDU is a Consultant led bedded unit (mini ward) where patients are cared for while they are awaiting results of clinical investigations. 

'This is a recognised model of care for patients who are waiting for the appropriate decision to be made on whether they are admitted or discharged into community based care or back home.'
