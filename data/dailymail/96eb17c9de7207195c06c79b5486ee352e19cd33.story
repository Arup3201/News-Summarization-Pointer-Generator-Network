As a child, Menelik Watson dreamed of playing at Wembley.

But never in his wildest dreams did the Mancunian think he would be playing American football in front of 80,000 fans at the national stadium.

‘As a kid, we all had dreams to play in the Premier League and stuff. Playing in the FA Cup in Wembley was always something you dreamed of as a kid,’ said Watson after the Oakland Raiders’ first practice session on English soil.

‘American football wise, no. Not even after I got drafted. I watched the Steelers out here last year versus Minnesota and then I didn’t really think until the schedule came out. It’s like a dream really.’

The verb could be applied to Watson’s remarkable against-all-odds story, which culminated in being picked 42nd overall in the 2013 draft.

Watson will appear against the Miami Dolphins on Sunday, but not as a starter. The 6ft 5in offensive tackle has been used sparingly this season by the Oakland Raiders, featuring as an extra tight end.

But after an injury-plagued rookie season, Raiders head coach Dennis Allen is satisfied with his progress. After all, he’s only been playing the game since 2011.

‘I think, the one thing we have to remember is that Menelik is still a young player. He doesn’t have a lot of football experience. He’s still relatively young to the game,’ Allen said at the Raiders’ Pennyhill Park base. ‘I’m not in any way disappointed as far as where he’s at. He’s just still got some development to do, some growing up to do. I still think that he’s going to be a really good player at some point.

‘We felt really good about what Khalif Barnes has been able to do, too. Like I said, earlier in the year and throughout training camp, I like the depth on the offensive line. I think we’ve got several guys that can go in there and play and help us be effective as an offense. “We’re going to continue to use Menelik. We’ve used him in some jumbo tight end situations and we’ll continue to do that. We’ll see how he continues to come along.’

And Watson is determined to take his chance when it comes up.

‘At the end of the day, the situation is what it is. My job right now is to help us win football games. That’s the bottom line. We made strides as an offense in the preseason. Unfortunately, I strained my hip flexor and my groin, and that’s how this league works – next man up. So, the only thing I can control now is continuing to work my techniques like I was before and wait for my opportunity to get back on the field.’

And while his blurry-eyes team-mates are becoming accustomed with a foreign field some eight hours ahead of the Bay Area, Watson can at least enjoy some home comforts.

He managed to spend some precious time with his six-year-old daughter Orellana, who lives with his mother, and positively beamed while retelling the tale.

‘I got to pick her up from school and give her a hug and a kiss. It was her birthday Saturday, so I took her into town and spoiled her a bit. She got a little emotional when I was leaving. But I get to see her this weekend, so it’s not that bad.’

And if the Raiders secure their first win of the season, Watson and his team-mates will be smiling all the way home.
