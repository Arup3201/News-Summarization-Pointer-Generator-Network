Paul Gascoigne has arrived home after five days in hospital following an apparent drinking binge.

The England legend was found slumped outside his apartment last week clutching a bottle of gin and was admitted to Poole hospital.

Gascoigne, 49, was also reportedly in the process of being evicted of his £3million penthouse allegedly because of noise complaints from neighbours,

The director of the management company in charge of the flats dismissed claims he was being forced to leave, but said his landlord was not renewing the rental contract.

Christopher Eales, 84, said: 'The only thing I can tell you is that he has not been asked to leave.

'His lease will run out on September 13 and the landlord will not be renewing the contract as he wants the flat back.' 

The former Tottenham midfielder was kept in hospital for an emergency four-day detox.

It has been reported his hospitalisation on Thursday was the end result of a binge in which the former midfielder, who has long battled alcoholism, was seen by friends drinking straight gin from the bottle while lying in bed.

Worry: Friends told The Sun how Gascoigne had been drinking for three weeks in his house

Friends told The Sun how he had drinking for three weeks in his house, which they said stank of urine and vomit.

One said: 'He'd been drinking for about three weeks', while another added 'I saw him drinking neat gin straight from the bottle in his bed. He was off his face, a proper mess.'

Shortly before the ambulance had whisked him away, at 3pm, the former England star was seen calling a friend to plead: ‘I’m in trouble, please can you come and help me?’

He had been observed drinking in public on several occasions in preceding days, and at lunchtime on Tuesday was videoed by a passer-by in what appeared to be an inebriated state, in central Bournemouth.
