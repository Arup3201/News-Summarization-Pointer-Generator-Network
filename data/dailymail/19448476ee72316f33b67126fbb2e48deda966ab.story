It was a mission that captivated audiences across the world - and now images have revealed the dramatic moment Orion was safely recovered into the huge well deck of the USS Anchorage.

A combined US Navy and Nasa team successfully towed the spacecraft out of the water after a flawless launch and landing.

And Orion - which will one day take astronauts to an asteroid and ultimately Mars - will be brought triumphantly back to shore later today.

‘This mission exemplifies the US Navy commitment to the research and development of technologies and techniques to ensure the safety of human space flight support,’ said Anchorage Commanding Officer, Captain Michael McKenna.

‘I could not be more proud of my crew.’

The successful retrieval of Exploration Flight Test 1 (EFT-1) was part of a US government inter-agency effort to test recovery techniques for future space flights.

But although this was Orion’s first trip to space, it is actually the fifth at-sea testing of a module using the Navy well deck recovery method - although the others had used mock-ups.

Four tests were conducted prior to the flight to prepare the recovery team and make sure everything went smoothly.

The first test was conducted at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia in August 2013. The others were conducted earlier in 2014, known as Underway Recovery Tests (URTs).

The USS Anchorage was ultimately chosen for EFT-1 as it has a combination of capabilities suited to assist Nasa with the Orion recovery.

Called a landing platform dock (LPD) ship, it has a well-deck, advanced medical facilities, helicopters, three dimensional air-search radar and small boats that could all be used in the recovery operation.

A specially-trained bridge team were also used throughout the duration of the recovery.

And once the capsule had landed in the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of Baja California, the ship manoeuvred close to it along with small boats in order to safely retrieve it.

Divers attached lines from the small boats to guide the capsule toward Anchorage, where a Nasa-designed winch hauled the capsule into the well deck.

‘Orion is meant to be reused, which is why we tailored this recovery to accommodate keeping the capsule safe,’ said Navy Diver 1st Class Matthew Demyers of Explosive Ordnance Disposal Mobile Unit 11.

And Chief Boatswain’s Mate Jason B. Roberts, deck department leading chief petty officer, added: 'We practiced this recovery many times with safety as the number one priority. The sailors were focused and completed the mission at hand successfully.

'I couldn't be more proud of our sailors and the work they accomplished here today.’

The spacecraft, which could someday take humans to Mars, made a fiery 20,000 mph (32,000 kph) re-entry into the planet enduring temperatures of 2,200°C (4,000°F), artist's illustration shown

In 11 minutes, Orion slowed from to 20 mph (32kph) at splashdown - its final descent aided by eight parachutes deployed in sequence

On Friday Nasa's new Orion spacecraft made the 'bull's-eye' splashdown in the Pacific  following its dramatic test flight that took it twice around Earth in 4.5 hours.

The spacecraft, which could someday take humans to Mars, made a fiery 20,000 mph (32,000 kph) re-entry into the planet enduring temperatures of 2,200°C (4,000°F).

Cameras fitted to the rocket and capsule captured the entire mission - giving an unprecedented 'Orion's-eye' view from inside the capsule that could on day take man to Mars. 

Looking home: Cameras onboard the Orion capsule took this stunning snap of the Earth during re-entry. Flames show the incredible heat the capsule was subjected to, as it hit speeds of 20,000 mph and weathered temperatures approaching 2,200°C (4,000°F)

During the uncrewed test, Orion traveled twice through the Van Allen belt, where it experienced periods of intense radiation, and reached an altitude of 3,600 miles above Earth. 

The spacecraft hit speeds of 20,000 mph (32,000 kph) and weathered temperatures approaching 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit as it entered Earth's atmosphere. 

If astronauts had been onboard Orion, they would have experienced a g-force of 8.2 - nearly twice that generated when Soyuz capsules return from the International Space Station.

Orion hit its target point 275 miles (442 km) west of Baja, California, and achieved at least one record: flying farther and faster than any capsule built for humans since the Apollo moon program.

'There's your new spacecraft, America,' Mission Control commentator Rob Navias said as the Orion capsule neared the water. 

He called the journey 'the most perfect flight you could ever imagine.'

The capsule reached a peak altitude more than 14 times farther from Earth than the International Space Station. No spacecraft designed for astronauts had gone so far since Apollo 17, 42 years ago.

Nasa needed to send Orion that high in order to set the crew module up for a rapid and fiery entry. 

That was considered the most critical part of the entire flight - testing the largest of its kind heat shield for survival before humans climb aboard.

In 11 minutes, Orion slowed from to 20 mph (32km/h) at splashdown - its final descent aided by eight parachutes deployed in sequence.  

Earth shrank from view through Orion's capsule window during its trip out to space, and stunning images were relayed back home. Its return was recorded by an unmanned drone flying over the recovery zone, providing more spectacular views. 

Helicopters then relayed images of the crew module bobbing in the water. 

Three of the five air bags deployed properly, enough to keep the capsule floating upright.

'Today's flight test of Orion is a huge step for NASA and a really critical part of our work to pioneer deep space on our Journey to Mars,' said Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden on Friday.

'The teams did a tremendous job putting Orion through its paces in the real environment it will endure as we push the boundary of human exploration in the coming years.' 

After being offloaded at shore the capsule will make the journey back to Kennedy from San Diego on the back of a truck - and officials said they hoped it would arrive by Christmas.

Orion is being developed alongside the world's most powerful rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), which is due to make its maiden launch in 2018 or 2019.

Together, SLS and Orion will allow Nasa to send humans into deep space to destinations such as Mars.

There were a number of key moments throughout the flight (shown in diagram), designed to test the capability of Orion, all of which it passed without a hitch. In total the flight lasted about four and a half hours

First step towards Mars: Orion's Delta IV Heavy rocket clears the service tower that sits alongside the launchpad at Cape Canaveral. The high-stakes test flight is meant to usher in a new era of human exploration leading ultimately to Mars

Test flight: Orion made two big laps around Earth before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph (32,200 km/h). Pictured is an artist's impression of the Orion craft with its dummy service module in orbit

Ambition: The earliest Orion might carry passengers is 2021; a mission to an asteroid is on the space agency's radar sometime in the 2020s and Mars, the grand prize, in the 2030s
