France has launched an
investigation into unidentified drones that have been spotted
over nuclear plants operated by state-owned utility EDF
, its interior minister said on Thursday.

Seven nuclear plants across the country were flown over by drones between October 5 and October 20, an EDF spokeswoman said,
without any impact on the plants' safety or functioning.

'There's a judicial investigation under way, measures are
being taken to know what these drones are and neutralise them,'
Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve told France Info radio yesterday - without specifying the measures.

The drone sightings may renew concerns about the safety of
nuclear plants in France, the world's most nuclear-reliant
country with 58 reactors on 19 sites operated by EDF.

Activists from environmental campaigning group Greenpeace
forced their way into the Fessenheim plant on the German border
earlier this year and have a history of breaking into nuclear
plants in France.

Greenpeace denied any involvement in the pilotless flight
activity.

'For all its actions, Greenpeace always acts openly and
claim responsibility,' Yannick Rousselet, head of Greenpeace's
anti-nuclear campaign, said in a statement.

'What is happening
is very worrying,' he said, adding that France's nuclear
research institute CEA near Paris had also been flown over,
citing unspecified sources.

EDF named the plants over which drones had been spotted as
Creys-Malville and Bugey in the southeast, Blayais in the
soutwest, Cattenom and Chooz in the northeast, Gravelines in the
north and Nogent-sur-Seine, the closest plant to Paris.

The unmanned aircraft were spotted late in the evening, at
night or very early in the morning, EDF said. It is prohibited
to fly less than 1,000 meters above nuclear plants and within a
5 kilometer radius.

Each plant has filed a formal complaint with the police
against the anonymous people behind the drone flights.

The drone, circled, landed in front of Ms Merkel as she delivered a speech sin Germany sparking fears that the device could easily be used to commit a terrorist act  

Last year there was an incident in Germany  where a drone was able to land just in front of German Chancellor Angela Merkel as she delivered a speech.

This week New York police said they are concerned drones could become tools for terrorists, and are investigating ways to stop potential attacks.

Until now police haven't acknowledged drones as a potential weapon, but the NYPD has now said the technology has advanced enough that someone could use them to carry out an air assault using chemical weapons and firearms.

Police want to develop technology which will allow them to take control of drones as well as scan the skies for them before major events.
