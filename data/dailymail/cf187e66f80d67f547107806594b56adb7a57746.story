An obsessed admirer who was jailed for stalking a beauty queen is behind bars again for breaching his restraining order.

Anthony Mantova, 34, was handed an 18-week custodial sentence in July after pleading guilty to harassing Chloe Hopkins.

He had tattooed Ms Hopkins' name across his chest and wore a T-shirt with her photograph on it.

But upon his release from prison he broke an indefinite restraining order, preventing him from contacting former Miss Prestatyn 2010 Chloe Hopkins, creating communication about her, and entering the street where she lives.

He was jailed again for 28 days at Prestatyn Magistrates Court on November 14th for harassment of Ms Hopkins and breaching his restraining order.

Ms Hopkins, 20, known as Prestatyn’s Pop Princess, said: 'He had breached his bail conditions.

'It is awful this has started again. I just want it to stop. I don’t know what I have done wrong.

'He’s been upsetting a lot of my friends.'

Miss Hopkins has welcomed new laws to help the victims of stalkers but called for longer sentences

Mantova was also ordered to serve 14 days in prison for breaching the restraining order while on licence from prison for his last offence.

His total sentence amounted to 42 days and he will be released from prison in December.

While Ms Hopkins has welcome new laws to help victims of stalkers she believes tougher sentences are needed.

Two specific criminal offences of stalking have come into force in England and Wales for the first time designed to provide extra protection for victims, highlight the serious impact stalking can have on their lives and help bring more perpetrators to justice.

She said: 'It has been a long time coming. But the sentences should be longer, I think they could have gone further.'

The beauty queen suffered a two-year nightmare when she was being stalked by Mantova and she tried to take her own life as the abuse sent her into a spiral of depression and isolation.

The former Prestatyn High School pupil first met Mantova while on a night out in Prestatyn with friends in August 2010 when they approached him after feeling sorry for him.

He then added Chloe on social networking site Facebook and started attending her appearances after she was crowned Miss Prestatyn taking pictures during events.

He also had a T-shirt printed with her picture, set up online petitions against her and left suggestive comments on Facebook, which Ms Hopkins became upset might be seen by some of her young fans and had her name and the name of three friends tattooed on his chest.

Ms Hopkins said she could not have got through the last two years without the support of her family, friends, fans and supporters in the local community.

She said: 'A lot of people have been coming up to me and telling me things that Anthony Mantova has done to them. If anyone has any information about what he has done to them they need to come forward and tell the police.'
