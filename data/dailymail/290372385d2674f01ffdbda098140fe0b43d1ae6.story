A baby born in the North West of England will live on average two years less than a child born in the South East, new Government figures have revealed.

The figures give a snapshot of life in Britain today and reveal the divisions between life-expectancy rates for people living in different areas of Britain.

Following the release of the latest figures from the Office of National Statistics, while people may not live as long, a typical house in the North West costs around half as much as a property 200 miles to the south.

A nation of contrasts: London has a younger population and generates more income than the North East

The Independent also highlighted the economic unbalance of London in comparison to the rest of the country. London currently generates one fifth of the country's output.

The capital also has the greatest amount of young people, with a median age of 34, compared to the national average of 40.

England's South West is clearly the retirement hotspot of the country, with an average age of 42.9 years.

The worst place to live in terms of unemployment is the North-East of England where 10.3 per cent of the population are out of work.

This compares to the national average unemployment rate, which stands at 7.3 per cent.

But the area with the greatest number of unqualified adults is the West Midlands at 13.9 per cent.

House prices are still on the rise according to the figures, with Yorkshire and Humber being the only area that recorded a drop of 0.2 per cent.

But overall crime estimated by the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) in the year ending June 2013 fell 7 percentÂ  compared with the previous year.

This figure, which is an estimate is the lowest since the survey began in 1981.

The number of crimes recorded by the police in the year to June 2013 fell by percent.
