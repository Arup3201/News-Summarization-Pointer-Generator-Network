A New Jersey man accused of grooming a 14-year-old New Mexico girl online before driving to her Albuquerque home and leaving town with her for more than two weeks has appeared in court.

Robert Joseph Butler, 26, is charged with one count of transporting a minor with the intent to engage in sexual activity.

Butler had been communicating with the girl via social media and text messages for more than a year before making arrangements to meet her at her home in Albuquerque on March 31.

The pair then left together and were missing for more than two weeks before police tracked them down on Thursday in Fort Smith, Arkansas, nearly 900 miles away.

Police issued an Amber Alert for the girl after they found surveillance video of her getting into a car with Butler.

According to KRQE, Butler stole a Subaru in Pennsylvania and spray-painted it white.

The pair had also dyed their hair to avoid detection, and were living out of the car and in the woods.

In the two-and-a-half weeks she was missing, the girl was taken to Oklahoma City, Texas and Arkansas by Butler.

'This has been an ongoing, intense investigation for the last 15 days,' supervisory deputy Tony Overstreet told the Times Record.

'The only lead that we had popped up here in Fort Smith, and we’ve been working it since Monday night.'

Police finally caught up with the pair in a Target parking lot on April 17 after spotting a car matching the description of the one stolen in Pennsylvania and seeing the two return to the car from the store.

'It was just like a dream come true but, it was almost too good to be real because we had so many great leads that the marshals, the FBI, everybody was working on and then nothing would become of it,' the girl's father told KRQE.

According to a press release, police believe that during their travels, the teen and Butler engaged in sexual activity.

Butler was extradited to New Mexico and appeared in court Thursday.

'Crimes against children remain among the highest priorities for our office.  We are dedicated to doing all we can to identify and prosecute those who commit federal crimes targeting children, including those who seek to contact children over the internet for sexual purposes and then actually transport a minor to further that conduct, as is alleged in this case. 

'We must do all we can to keep our communities and our children safe from these horrific crimes,' U. S. Attorney Conner Eldridge said Thursday.
