Mitt Romney last night turned a famous Democratic slogan against President Barack Obama by telling his opponent that Americans would not be diverted by peripheral issues this November: ‘It’s still the economy… and we’re not stupid.’

The warning to Obama was a deft re-working of Bill Clinton’s 1992 dictum, coined by his campaign chief James Carville and hammered home at every opportunity in that election: ‘It’s the economy, stupid.’

Romney, who comfortably won five 
primaries in New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut,, Rhode Island and 
Delaware, used a victory speech in Manchester, New Hampshire – a key 
swing state and the first primary state Romney won – to shift the focus 
towards Obama.

With Rick Santorum out of the race and
 Newt Gingrich – who had hoped to win in Delaware - expected to withdraw
 at any time, Romney has now been fully embraced by the Republican party
 as their presumptive nominee.

Newt Gingrich once again hinted he might quit the presidential race last night after finishing nearly 30 points behind Mitt Romney in the one primary he hoped to win.

Mr Gingrich got just 27.1 per cent of votes in Delaware – a winner-takes-all state where he had campaigned most vigorously for its 18 delegates.

The former Speaker of the House told a small crowd in Concord, North Carolina:  ‘I want you to know over the next few days, we’re going to look realistically at where we are at.’

The night before before Mr Romney swept the board in Delaware and five other states, Mr Gingrich said he would ‘take a deep look at what we are doing’ after the results.

He hinted that he would continue running until the May 8 primary in North Carolina, NBC News reported.

Standing beside his wife, Callista (pictured above), Mr Gingrich also acknowledged that ‘the results were clear enough’ in Delaware.

Unlike Rick Santorum, who failed to endorse Mr Romney when he quit the race last week, Mr Gingrich also hinted that he may back the presumptive candidate.

‘I want you all to understand that Governor Romney is going to have a very good night and it is a night that he has worked hard for, for six years,’ he said.

‘And that if he does end up as the nominee, I think every conservative in the country has to be committed to defeating Barack Obama and let’s be very clear about this.’

‘Four years ago Barack Obama dazzled 
us in front of Greek columns with sweeping promises of hope and change,’
 he said. ‘But after we came down to earth, after the celebration and 
parades, what do we have to show for three and a half years of President
 Obama?

‘Is it easier to make ends meet? Is it
 easier to sell your home or buy a new one? Have you saved what you 
needed for retirement? Are you making more in your job? Do you have a 
better chance to get a better job? Do you pay less at the pump?’

Promising that he knew ‘how to lead us
 out of this stagnant Obama economy and into a job-creating recovery’, 
he predicted ‘a campaign of diversions, distractions, and distortions’ 
over the next six months.

‘That kind of campaign may have worked
 at another place over in a different time. But not here and not now. 
It’s still about the economy …and we’re not stupid.’

He added: ‘Americans have always been 
eternal optimists, but over the last three and a half years, we have 
seen hopes and dreams diminished by false promises and weak leadership. 
Everywhere I go, Americans are tired of being tired.’

Most polls show Obama slightly ahead 
of Romney but with the Republican having only just emerged from a 
bruising primary, his aides are confident that the President is 
eminently beatable.

Obama is stronger among women and his 
‘likeability’ numbers are healthier than Romney’s. But the former 
Massachusetts governor made clear he would not try to run a race about 
personal popularity or pretend to have the kind of magnetic appeal that 
Obama won with in 2008.

He even predicted he would induce 
tedium among voters. ‘I’ll probably start out talking about my wonderful
 wife Ann – I usually do – and I’ll probably bore you with stories about
 our kids and grandkids.’

At the same time, he gave notice that 
he would push back hard against the notion that, as a venture capitalist
 with an estimated worth of more than $200 million, that he is a 
plutocrat out of touch with ordinary Americans.

‘I’ll tell you about how much I love 
this country, where someone like my dad, who grew up poor and never 
graduated from college, could pursue his dreams and work his way up to 
running a great car company.

)Romney said he would introduce himself
 to voters who had not previously paid much attention to the Republican 
primaries and ‘tell you a little bit about myself’.

His wealth, he insisted, was 
hard-earned.

‘I’d say that you might have heard that I was successful in
 business. And that rumor is true

'But you might not have heard that I 
became successful by helping start a business that grew from 10 people 
to hundreds of people.

‘You might not have heard that our 
business helped start other businesses, like Staples and Sports 
Authority and a new steel mill and a learning center called Bright 
Horizons.

'And I’d tell you that not every business made it and there 
were good days and bad days, but every day was a lesson.’
