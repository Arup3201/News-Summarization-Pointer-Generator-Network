An Irish teenager has been charged after threatening to assassinate the president of Guyana in what his lawyer said was an alcohol-fuelled row with two of the leader's bodyguards.

Cillian Crosson, a 17-year-old volunteer with an aid group in the South American country, allegedly told the men he would shoot and kill president Donald Ramotar.

His defence lawyer, Glenn Hanoman, said the youth made the threat because he didn't really believe the pair were actually bodyguards.

'Assassination threat': Two bodyguards of Guyanese president Donald Ramotar, left, raised the alarm after 17-year-old Irish aid group volunteer Cillian Crossan drunkenly told them he would shoot and kill the leader

'He had been drinking beer since early
 the morning and had even mixed rum and beer and had them at the same 
time,' said Mr Hanoman.

'I think that was the main factor at play when he argued with two of the guards.'

Guyana,
 a member state of the Commonwealth of Nations, is the only South 
American nation whose official language is English and also the only 
Caribbean country that is not an island.

The
 incident happened on Thursday March 28 at a rodeo in the rugged and remote 
Rupununi region, which is along the country's southern border with 
Brazil.

Crosson, from Lambtown, Ardlee, 
pleaded not guilty to a charge of using threatening language before a local magistrate. He was 
released on the equivalent of about £200 bail over the objections of 
prosecutor Vishnu Hunte.

'The threat was directed to none other
 than the president of Guyana, his excellency Donald Ramotar, by a 
foreign national,' Mr Hunte said.

'There is therefore a likelihood that he may flee the jurisdiction since he is not a resident of Guyana.'

The offence is classed as a minor crime and Crosson, who is in Guyana for one year as a volunteer with the British group Project Trust, faces a maximum sentence of a fine of no more than £650.

Historically, politics are a source of tension in the country, and violent riots have often broken out during elections.

Ingrid Emerson, chief executive of the Project Trust, said in a statement: 'On Thursday 28th March 2013 a group of Project Trust Volunteers celebrated the annual Easter Rodeo festival in the southern town of Lethem.

'During the course of the festivities a Project Trust Volunteer was arrested on suspicion of using threatening language.

'The 17 year old has since been bailed. Project Trust is working closely with the volunteer's family and is in constant contact with the Irish Consul and the British High Commission.'
