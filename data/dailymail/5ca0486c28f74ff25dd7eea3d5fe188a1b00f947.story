A week after restrictions on Romanian and Bulgarian migrants arriving in the UK were lifted, a new survey has revealed that more than three-quarters of British people want to see a cut in immigration.

A British Social Attitudes survey found that 56 per cent of the population believe the number of migrants allowed into Britain should be cut by 'a lot', and a further 21 per cent feel it should be reduced 'a little'.

However, NatCen Social Research has found that fewer people now than in 2011 think immigration is bad for the economy - 47 per cent in 2013 compared with 52 per cent two years previously.

Findings: A survey has revealed three-quarters of British people want a cut in immigration, just a week after restrictions on Romanian and Bulgarian migrants were lifted. Pictured are Romanians passing through airport security for a flight to Heathrow

Journey: People put their luggage in a bus departing from Sofia's central bus station in Bulgaria to London via Austria, Germany and France

The latest results of the survey, which are to be revealed in a BBC Two documentary The Truth About Immigration tonight at 9.30pm, come nearly a week after access restrictions to the UK labour market were lifted for Romanians and Bulgarians.

Penny Young, chief executive at NatCen Social Research, said: 'British Social Attitudes shows that public desire for a cut in immigration to the UK had begun to rise even before the restrictions on migrants from Romania or Bulgaria were lifted at the start of the year.

'Moreover, a majority of people who think immigration is good, economically or culturally, for the UK still want to see it cut.

'These findings highlight the complexity of this issue for politicians facing two elections in 18 months and with limited options if they want to attempt to reduce migration from Europe.

'The public broadly agrees that immigration is too high, but there are stark social divisions over the economic and cultural benefits of immigration.'

The research shows 54 per cent of 
respondents see immigration as good for the economy and 55per cent of 
those who see it is as culturally beneficial also want to see 
immigration reduced.

The survey also reveals divisions among political party supporters.

Some
 40 per cent of Labour party supporters think immigration is bad for the 
economy but 36per cent believe it is good for the economy, the research 
shows, while 40 per cent think immigration is bad for British culture and
 41per cent see it as good for British culture.

Meanwhile, some 52 per cent of 
Conservatives believe Britain's cultural life is undermined by 
immigration into the UK, compared with 20 per cent of Liberal Democrats.

Immigration is least popular among people with few or no qualifications, NatCen said.

Regrets: Jack Straw (left) said predictions over the number of eastern Europeans entering the country in 2004 were 'catastrophic', although former home secretary David Blunkett (right) said he did not regret the decision

A
 total of 85 per cent of those with few or no qualifications want to see a
 decrease in immigration, while 88 per cent of people in higher grade manual jobs want a
 reduction.

In the documentary, presented by 
political editor Nick Robinson, former Labour ministers reflect on their
 decision to open the doors to workers from Eastern Europe in 2004, when
 Poland and seven other countries joined the EU.

Jack
 Straw, foreign secretary from 2001 to 2006, said: 'The predications 
were completely catastrophic. I mean they were wrong by a factor of ten.
 On immigration, it was bluntly a nightmare and it got more and more 
difficult."

'We did get it 
wrong and I deeply regret it,' said Mr Straw. 'I regret it because it 
undermines trust in government, if you're that wrong.'

Assumption: Theresa May, shown visiting Border Agency staff with David Cameron in 2010 said there had been an assumption that immigration was good for the economy

However, David Blunkett, home secretary from 2001 to 2004, told the programme he did not regret the decision.

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: 'I think there should have been more debate about immigration, I think we should have had a more calm, measured debate and sensible response to people's concerns.

'But also listening to what those concerns were, listening to people who were worried about jobs or wages or worried about the pace of change.

'And to have that debate about it rather than simply thinking you can't talk about it for fear that that might be the politics of the Right.'

UKIP leader Nigel Farage told the programme that he believed that fear of being labelled as a racist has stifled the debate on immigration.

Contrast: Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper (left) said there should be more debate about immigration, although Nigel Farage (right) told the programme he felt fear of being labelled racist had stifled discussion

He said: 'They tried to rubbish us, 
they tried to say that anybody that dared to talk about this subject was
 necessarily a bad person and racist, that was what they tried to do and
 actually this has been going on ever since (Enoch) Powell's speech.'

He said: 'I'm unapologetic because if 
you don't have legal managed migration and people don't sign up so they 
pay national insurance and tax, they'll work illegally.'

Theresa
 May, Home Secretary, told the programme: 'I think the problem in the 
past has been that there's been this general assumption that immigration
 was always good for the economy.

'I don't think people have looked at it 
sufficiently closely to be able to recognise the impact it has on 
members of the public.'
