Three-time Indianapolis 500 champion Dario Franchitti was airlifted to hospital after a horror crash during the last corner of the last lap of today's IndyCar race in Houston that also hurt 13 spectators.

Scottish-born racer Franchitti's car went airborne when he was shunted by Japanese driver Takuma Sato, slamming the car at over 100 mph into the safety fencing and causing it to spin several times against the fence, firing debris into the grandstands.

Franchitti was seen on television cameras to be moving in the aftermath of the crash as safety stewards dashed to offer assistance and his team owner Chip Ganassi said Franchitti was 'awake and alert' in the helicopter on the way to hospital and had injured his ankle and back.

It was later announced that despite suffering a fractured spine, broken ankle and concussion, the IndyCar champ will only be kept in hospital overnight for observation.

Senior Captain Ruy Lozana of the Houston Fire Department said that two of the 13 spectators were sent to hospital while the rest were fine to be treated at the scene.

Franchitti was taken to a hospital near Reliant Park in Houston to be treated.

Race officials said Franchitti was 'awake and alert' but did not go into details on his injuries.

His team owner Chip Ganassi said Franchitti injured his ankle and back.

'He's talking,' said Ganassi who rushed 
to the crash scene on a scooter. 'His ankle is a little sore, his back 
is a little sore. He is going to be OK.'

The three-car smash happened in one of the sharp turns and also involved Japan's Takuma Sato and E.J. Viso of Venezuela but both the drivers were able to leave their cars and walk away.

Debris from the crash also flew over the top of the safety fencing, injury some spectators.

Race officials did not immediately provide details of those injuries.

The race was won by Australia's Will Power.

The incident caused victory celebrations for Power to be muted as he hoped that Franchitti was alright.

'It just looked bad, I hate seeing that,' Power said. 'I just hope he’s OK…But it was a very good day on the track. 'We were able to help Helio out a bit in the championship, and I just hope Dario is alright.'

'Everybody hopes Dario is OK,' said New Zealand driver Scott Dixon.

Sato said that his car clipped the wall before triple-Indy 500 champion Franchitti's car collided with his.

'On the last lap I caught the marbles and brushed the wall and lost 
momentum,' Sato said to the LA Times. 'A couple cars passed me as I was off line and in 
Turn 5. I got very loose and Dario and I came together. Hopefully Dario 
is OK.'

Before their Divorce: Dario Franchitti seen with his estranged wife, actress Ashley Judd in May 2010 at the 94th Indianapolis 500 Trophy Presentation at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway

In January, it was announced that Franchitti was splitting from actress Ashley Judd, his wife of 13-years.

The 44-year-old U.S. actress and the Scottish racing driver, 39, announced they were ending their marriage in a joint statement on Tuesday.

They told People.com at the time: 'We have mutually decided to end our marriage.

'We'll always be family and continue to cherish our relationship based on the special love, integrity, and respect we have always enjoyed.'

A spokesman for the actress subsequently confirmed the news to MailOnline when asked for comment, stressing their decision to split was a mutual one, not one-sided.

The Missing actress tied the knot in December 2001 in Scotland in a private ceremony.
