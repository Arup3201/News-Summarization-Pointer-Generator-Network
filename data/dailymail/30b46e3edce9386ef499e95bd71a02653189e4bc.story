Waiting for my shipmates to arrive, I sprawl on the deck of Nomad, a 37ft yacht, and look across the water from Gosport to Portsmouth.

With a backing track of halyards clinking against masts in the marina, and the sea reflecting the sun’s evening rays, it is hard to believe this is England.

Exhilarating: Sailing boats navigating  the Isle of Wight in blustery but sunny weather during Cowes week

I’m here for a five-day yachting course with Nomad Sailing, a training centre run by RYA-certified instructor Jim Barden and his sister, Lou.

The pair abandoned their day jobs in 2008 to teach full-time, and lead shore-based theory classes in London and the South-East, as well as practical courses on the Solent.

Families can learn with Nomad en masse ahead of a Mediterranean flotilla holiday.

Ahoy! Instructor Lou Barden offers a student the benefit of her experience on one of Nomad's courses

My fellow mariners include a sailing novice from Poland, a boat-owning barrister from Eastbourne and a human resources manager from Essex.

What do we have in common? Little, besides our love of the sea.

But we don’t waste time on small talk: before long we’re rubbing sun cream into one another’s backs and sharing grisly details of our love lives.

Instructor Jim is equipped not just with limitless knowledge, but a buoyant personality. It’s high fives all round when we get something right.

Leaving Gosport bright and early on the first day, we practise our manoeuvres and then sail across to the Isle of Wight.

There’s great satisfaction in navigating your way using a chart, pencil, plotter and compass. The boat is rigged with a state-of-the-art GPS system, but the RYA insists we learn the manual methods.

It’s a challenge - one false tidal calculation can leave you washed up for hours.

Sundowner: The sunset at Poole Harbour, where the Nomad moors up for the night

We sleep on Nomad each night, and take turns cooking. In Yarmouth, I conjure up a spag bol.

The barrister delivers his verdict - the carrots should have been chopped smaller - before Jim takes us ashore to Salty’s, a packed sailors’ bar where dancing on the tables is compulsory.

We journey on to Poole, where we moor up against the sea wall and sleep to the smell of fish and chips, then the pretty market town of Lymington, and over to Cowes, where preparations for the regatta are in full swing.

We even sail breathtakingly close to the toothy Needles.

The trip proves a great opportunity for a whistle-stop tour of English seaside towns, and the hard work of our daytime sails is balanced with chilly swims, ice cream and boozy evenings.

The highlight is our night sail, using nothing but lights to guide the way.

My heart thumps as we slip the lines at dusk and chug from Lymington into an empty sea. ‘In one minute you should see a green buoy to starboard, flashing every four seconds,’ the skipper calls from the chart table, as the crew peer through binoculars.

The line on the horizon where the sea meets the sky is indistinguishable in the dark, and it feels as though we’re floating on air.

Practical courses with Nomad Sailing (01424 461185, www.nomadsailing.co.uk) run between March and November, from £245 per person. Price includes food and accommodation.
