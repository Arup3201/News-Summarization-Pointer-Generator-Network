World football's top 25 officials have had their salaries doubled after a new ethics committee promised to stamp out their bonuses, an investigation has claimed.

It is alleged that Fifa - which faces corruption claims over the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar - also offered to pay its executive committee in wads of cash through a Swiss bank account.

The claims today, revealed in a cache of millions of documents leaked to The Sunday Times, are the latest in a growing litany against the governing body of world football.

The executive committee led by President Sepp Blatter, Exco for short, is Fifa's most powerful body and numbers 25 top officials from the football world.

Britain's representative Jim Boyce is one of Exco's seven vice presidents and has already said he would support a rerun of the 2022 vote if corruption allegations are proven.

The revelations come just four months after Fifa promised to clean up allegations of corruption by scrapping bonuses to its committee.

A new audit and compliance body was formed in July 2012 and its chief, Domenico Scala, said in February that executives had agreed to scrap the bonuses because they could encourage unethical behaviour.

He said Exco was an 'oversight and decision-making body... not responsible for sales,' adding: 'We don’t want to provide a bonus to people overseeing the operations.'

But according to the report today in 
The Sunday Times, each of the 25 members' salaries has risen from 
£59,000 to £118,000 this year after the bonuses - reputedly worth 
£44,000 a year - were scrapped.

June 1, 2014: £3m in 'corrupt' payments

The Sunday Times revealed it had been handed 'millions' of documents which exposed how a top Qatari football official, 65-year-old Mohammed Bin Hammam (right), handed officials £3million worth of cash and global junkets to help secure the 2022 World Cup.

MPs called for Qatar to be stripped of the tournament amid an investigation. Qatar hit back, saying it 'always upheld the highest standard of ethics and integrity' and that Bin Hammam 'played no official or unofficial role in Qatar’s 2022 Bid Committee'.

June 8: Secret gas deal talks

The newspaper revealed more files detailing how Bin Hammam fixed meetings with the Qatari royal family for at least seven key members of Exco, including Sepp Blatter.

Two secret meetings were brokered between Qatari royals and an aide to Thailand's serving Fifa member to discuss a gas deal in the critical final months before the 2022 ballot, it was reported.

June 15: Fifa 'ignored high terror risk'

Further revelations alleged that Qatar had been deemed at the highest risk of a terrorist attack of any of the 2022 host nations.

The documents added to questions over how a nation with scorching summer heat and little footballing tradition won the World Cup.

An unnamed Exco member told the newspaper the salary 'doubled to take account of the dropping of the bonus.'

The newspaper alleged Exco members enjoy generous expenses - including stays in a £200-a-night hotel in Rio de Janiero during the Brazil World Cup and more than £400 a day in generous expenses.

Leaked documents also claimed Exco members were allowed to take their salaries in envelopes full of cash at Fifa's headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland.

The timing of the revelations, during the current World Cup in Brazil, is devastating for Mr Blatter as he remains firmly in the public eye.

Brazilian authorities are already fighting unrest in large cities including Rio de Janiero over the huge amount spent on the tournament - and the vast profits for Fifa - in a country with extreme poverty.

The governing body of world football is highly secretive about the salaries it pays its top officials.

Accounts list the total of payments to Fifa's 'key management personnel', which includes not only the 25 Exco members but also directors and other top staff.

This figure was £21.3million last year - a rise of £1.6million in a year since 2012.

The pay of Fifa President Sepp Blatter and the other 24 members of Exco is now set by a compensation committee led by Mr Scala.

Earlier this month the chairman of the Britain's parliamentary committee for Culture, Media and Sport said Fifa needed a complete overhaul.

In a BBC interview earlier this month, John Whittingdale said an inquiry three years ago into the 2022 World Cup bidding process had received several allegations of 'potential corrupt payments'.

'Those were swept aside by Fifa, they weren't properly investigated, and that was three years ago,' he said.

'I don't think anybody is going to be that amazed to learned that the bid process is corrupted. It isn't sufficient just to have a rerun of a vote by a small number of people who conduct the vote in secret and are unaccountable.

'There needs to be a complete reform of Fifa.'

A spokesman from Fifa told MailOnline that football's governing body was not in a position to comment prior to Judge Hans-Joachim Eckert's reached his conclusions based on an investigation report due at the end of next month.

She said  Fifa 'does not comment on allegations', but added: 'Each year Fifa publishes its financial report in line with International Financial Reporting standards on our website.

'Furthermore, Fifa has established an independent Audit and Compliance Committee, as well as a remuneration committee that includes two independent persons namely the chairman of the Audit and Compliance Committee Domenico Scala as well Jean-Pierre Pedrazzini of Egon Zehnder, which defines and approves compensation and salaries of Fifa staff and the executive members.'
