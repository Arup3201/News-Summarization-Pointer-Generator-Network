Mario Balotelli gave manager Brendan Rodgers a timely reminder of what he is capable of as the misfiring Liverpool striker hit the target during an indoor training session, although it was only a bottle and not the net.

The 24-year-old has failed to impress for the Reds since his £16million move from AC Milan last summer, scoring just twice in all competitions - and still without a goal in the Premier League.

Such was his lack of form and playing time, the maverick Italian was linked with a move away from Anfield in the recent transfer window, but a return to Italy failed to materialise.

But there is still room for optimism that Balotelli can turn his Liverpool career around, with the striker all smiles as he posted a video on Instagram showing off his ball skills.

Balotelli posted the message 'lol crazy easy' accompanied with the video, as the former Milan striker accurately knocked over a plastic bottle from distance with a right-footed effort

Balotelli will be hoping to strike up a partnership with fit-again Daniel Sturridge at the heart of the Liverpool attack, after the latter returned from a five-month lay off to score in a win against West Ham last Saturday.
