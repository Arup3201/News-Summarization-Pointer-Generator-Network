Mystery: Two experts have demonstrated that it would have been almost impossible for Gareth Williams (above) to lock himself in the bag

The spy in the bag must have been dead or unconscious when he was locked into the holdall in which his body was found, an inquest heard yesterday.

An escapology expert tried and failed 300 times to lock himself into an identical bag after being hired to try to crack the mystery of Gareth Williams' death.

Peter Faulding said 'Harry Houdini would have struggled' to use the small brass travel padlock to seal himself inside, and someone else must have done it.

Mr Faulding, a former Parachute Regiment reservist, described theories that the reclusive MI6 codebreaker got into the North Face holdall by himself as 'unbelievable scenarios'.

His experiments appeared to be a key breakthrough in the riddle which has baffled Scotland Yard's most senior detectives. How Mr Williams died remains unknown. Mr Faulding's evidence came as details of material discovered on Mr Williams' laptops and mobile phones were revealed for the first time.

A short film on his work iPhone showed the 31-year-old wearing nothing but calf high leather boots, 'wriggling and gyrating' around a chair before bending over with his back to the camera.

Mr Williams had used other laptops to view fetish clothing websites and bondage and sadomasochism videos, as well as spending half his time on women's fashion sites and blogs.

Images he viewed on a French website showed a model enclosed in plastic using a vacuum cleaner to suck air out. Others were of people tied up with ropes.

Mr Faulding, a mine rescue specialist, was hired by police a month after the naked and decomposing body of Mr Williams was discovered in the bath in his flat in Pimlico, Central London, in August 2010.

The case sparked a blizzard of conspiracy theories, including claims Mr Williams was murdered by foreign spies or died in a sex game that went wrong.

Mr Faulding filmed himself attempting to get inside an identical heavy-duty holdall and lock himself in by threading a padlock through the eyelets of the zip.

Asked by coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox how many times he had tried, he replied 'probably 300'.

Contorted: A second video seen by the inquest shows a failed attempt at the 'frustrating, fiddly' task of pulling the zip within the 32in by 19in space

Unsolved: Coroner Fiona Wilcox has said that 
whether Mr Williams was alive inside the North Face bag like this one 
and locked it himself 'was at the very heart of this inquiry'

He said: 'I just cannot do it. This 
case, I just cannot get it off my mind. It is very difficult. I am an 
escapologist, I am thinking outside the box here and trying everything I
can to find a way.'

Dr Wilcox added: 'With all your trials and failures do you think it would be impossible to padlock this bag from the inside?'

Mr Faulding replied: 'I cannot say it was impossible, but even Houdini would struggle.'

He said Mr Williams could not have 
survived for more than 30 minutes as the temperature quickly rose and 
oxygen levels dropped. Mr Faulding said he only lasted five minutes 
before becoming 'delirious' after zipping himself inside with emergency 
oxygen and a paramedic outside.

He said other evidence reinforced his belief that someone else was involved.

No fingerprints or DNA were found 
where Mr Williams would have placed his hands on the bath and it would 
have been difficult to put the key where it was found under his right 
buttock.

But Mr Faulding said it would have been 'easy' for one person to lift the sturdy bag carrying the body, into the bath.

This may have been done to catch 
leaking body fluids, while the bathroom door could have been closed to 
contain the smell of decomposition, he said.

Baffling: The inquest heard the absence of fingerprints on the sides of Mr Williams' bath (pictured) suggests he did not lower himself into it

Suspicions: Mr Williams' body is taken out of his flat. Relatives believe a third party was either present when Gareth Williams died or broke into his home afterwards to destroy evidence

'My conclusion is Mr Williams was placed in the bag unconscious or he was dead when he was put in the bag,' he added.

A second expert, William MacKay, said 
he and a yoga-practising assistant made more than 100 attempts to 
recreate the feat without success.

But he refused to rule out the 
possibility that Mr Williams locked himself inside, highlighting that 
the rock climbing, fell running spy was extremely fit and dextrous. Mr 
Williams' former landlady has already revealed she once found him tied 
to the posts of his bed after he shouted for help one night.

DC Simon Warren said the spy spent half of his time viewing haute couture fashion websites.

But a small amount of material 
revealed he also viewed websites about famous drag queens and niche 
sexual fetishes, including bondage.

The inquest has also heard how Mr 
Williams may have been at risk from blackmail after making illicit 
searches on the top secret MI6 database. But a senior official, known 
only as SIS F, said there was no evidence that he had been identified by
hostile foreign agents, let along targeted.

The inquest continues next week.
