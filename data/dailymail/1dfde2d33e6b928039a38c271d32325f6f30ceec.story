The stage 
was set for a command performance by Treve but it was The Fugue, named 
after a technical musical term, who called the tune in the Group One 
Prince of Wales’s Stakes.

The
 John Gosden-trained filly, third to Al Kazeem in the race last year, 
has the petit feet of a ballerina and relished the quickening 
conditions, bouncing off the ground to win by a length and 
three-quarters from Magician in a new course record 10-furlong time of 2
 mins 1.9 secs.

Her
 success was hailed as his greatest moment in racing by owner and 
composer Lord Lloyd-Webber,  the man who named The Fugue, bred by his 
wife Madeleine, and also one the few who knows what it means!

But while the William Buick-ridden 11-2 winner floated over the turf, Treve travelled like a rusty bike with a flat tyre.

The
 2013 Arc winner and 8-13 favourite trained by Criquette Head-Maarek and
 ridden by Frankie Dettori, was only a length further back in third but 
the writing was on the wall before the home straight.

It
 would be an exaggeration to say Treve is a pale shadow of the 2013 
model but if someone had suggested last autumn she would be beaten on 
her first two runs this summer they would have been patted on the head 
sympathetically and told to lie down.

The
 ground or a physical issue might have been the cause of yesterday’s 
disappointing effort. But if and when she is brought back for an autumn 
campaign and a crack at a second Arc in October, she will have lost her 
air of invincibility.

A
 crestfallen Dettori said: ‘She went down to the start really bad. Maybe
 it was the ground? I was following The Fugue but struggling to keep up 
with her and never in my comfort zone.’

Buick
 never seemed out of his on The Fugue. The jockey has endured some 
mighty highs and lows with his admirable partner, whose 16 races have 
included 13 at group one level, four of them now ending in victory.

The
 ones that got away have included a nightmare passage when third to Was 
in the 2012 Oaks and two agonising defeats at the Breeders’ Cup, 
including having victory snatched away in the final stride by Magician 
in November, a reverse so hard to take Buick exited the Santa Anita 
track in tears.

It helped make yesterday’s win so satisfying and Buick said: ‘You have to believe in your horse and I did.

‘They
 can’t win every time but wherever she has gone, she has performed with 
credit.  I have ridden her from the start and she was probably the first
 good horse I ever rode.’

Gosden
 had been training The Fugue for next week’s Pretty Polly Stakes at the 
Curragh only to change his mind when she blossomed.

The
 trainer, who could go next to the Coral Eclipse two weeks on Saturday, 
said: ‘It is marvellous bringing Treve here. I think she unbeatable over
 a mile and a half with cut in the ground in the autumn. We wouldn’t go 
 near her then.

‘But I thought we had half a chance if we met her on mid-summer ground over a mile and a quarter.’ Gosden,
 successful on day one with Kingman in the St James’s Palace Stakes, 
also had Muwaary, length second to Dermot Weld’s Mustajeeb in the Jersey
 Stakes.

Having
 started the day almost £200,000 behind Richard Hannon, he finished it 
nearly £100,000 in front in a see-sawing race for the trainers’ title.

Hannon will not look back on the second day with fond memories.

Upset: Treve, ridden by Frankie Dettori, was beaten into third by The Fugue and Magician

He
 had warned his 2013 1,000 Guineas and Coronation Stakes winner Sky 
Lantern was short of peak fitness for the Duke Of Cambridge Stakes and 
she crossed the line in fifth, never looking likely to land a punch on 
Sir Michael Stoute-trained and Ryan Moore-ridden winner Integral, who 
set another track record.

More painful was the neck defeat of Tiggy Wiggy in a Queen Mary Stakes won by well-backed 9-4 favourite Anthem Alexander.

She
 was a second winner of the meeting for Irish trainer Eddie Lynam, who 
will not now run his King’s Stand winner Sole Power in Saturday’s 
Diamond Jubilee Stake.
