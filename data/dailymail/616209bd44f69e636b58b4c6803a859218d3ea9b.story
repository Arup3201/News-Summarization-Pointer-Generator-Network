Former Liverpool defender Mark Lawrenson believes Brendan Rodgers should select Lucas Leiva in midfield because the Brazilian would add some defensive solidity.

Liverpool have struggled this season to recapture the form that saw them run Manchester City close to last season's Premier League title and currently occupy 11th place in the current standings.

And Lawrenson believes Lucas could be the solution to some of Liverpool’s current problems.

‘Lucas is generally a 7/10 player. He isn’t going to change games, but he rarely lets you down and he knows his job,’ Lawrenson wrote in his Liverpool Echo column.

‘And if you are a team struggling for form, if you get enough 7/10 performances then you have a chance of changing from bad to good.’

Liverpool have struggled to dominate proceedings in midfield this season with Lukas restricted to three starts this term.

Joe Allen, Phillipe Coutinho and Emre Can have all featured in the Reds midfield in recent weeks and Lawrenson insists that Rodgers should give Lukas more game time alongside Steven Gerrard going forward. 

‘Management is about keeping an open mind with players,’ Lawrenson added.‘So Lucas now deserves a chance. After all, if a player comes in and does well, isn’t that what you want?

‘I don’t see why Lucas and Steven Gerrard can’t both play in a deep-lying defensive mode.’
