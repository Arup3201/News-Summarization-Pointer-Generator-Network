Cambridge University has beaten arch-rival Oxford to the top of the rankings for a second year running, pulling ahead across a variety of new tables.

This has been attributed to a decline in job prospects for Oxford graduates, with the recession having a major affect on the rankings.

The blow comes despite the fact that Oxford handed good degrees to 91 per cent of honours students last year and Cambridge 87 per cent.

At the other end of the list, just 44 per cent of University of East London graduates achieved a 2:1 or above.

There are various league tables for British universities - helping students pick an institution by ranking them for subject, student satisfaction, teaching, research and other categories for the whole of the year ahead.

Over 62 key subjects, Cambridge takes top place in 30 of the 46 it offers, and is in the top ten for all 46.

Oxford is in the leading 10 universities for all 32 of its subjects, and is placed first in 12.

Entry requirements are being toughened up to reflect the dominance of the ancient university, with the average student accepted to Cambridge now having the equivalent of almost five A grades.

But Philip Walker from the Higher Education Funding Council of England warned prospective students that league tables should not be looked at on their own when working out if a university is for you.

'It gives you some sort of broad guidance, but if you are an undergraduate - for example - you will just be interested in the university's score for teaching, not research, which is also included in the rankings.

'There are a range of things you need to do, including going to look at the university.'

Last month's tables from by the Complete University Guide showed the London School of Economics pushing Oxford into third place.

This was put down to the fact that LSE concentrates on a narrower range of subjects, and bucked the recession by increasing graduate employment rates.

It was the first time in the 15-year history of the tables Oxford has been beaten by the LSE, although it has previously been beaten in the table by Imperial College London - in 1999 and 2000, when it again took third place.

However, Oxford has taken top spot in the tables more times than Cambridge over the past decade.

The LSE is in the top ten for all 12 key subjects it offers and is top for three.

Dr Bernard Kingston, principal author of the Complete University Guide, said rises and falls in the rankings were driven to a considerable extent by the recession.

He suggested employers who typically recruit Oxbridge graduates may be struggling, affecting their employment rates.

'The employment market for graduates remains challenging and this is reflected in the rankings. Some universities have been more successful than others in adapting to the new conditions,' he said.

Cambridge has also come top in the 2013 Guardian University Guide league table for the second year running, while Oxford came second and the London School of Economics climbed a place to third.

St Andrews, rated third last year, is now in fourth place, while Warwick rose a place to fifth. University College London (UCL), Durham, Lancaster, Bath and Exeter make up the top 10.

Universities are ranked according to spending per student; their student/staff ratio; graduate career prospects; what grades applicants need; a value-added score that compares students' entry qualifications with their final degree results; and how happy final-year students are with their courses, based on the annual National Student Survey.
