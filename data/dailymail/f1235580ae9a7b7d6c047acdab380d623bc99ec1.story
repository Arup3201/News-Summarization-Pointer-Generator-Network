A replica of one of the most complete examples of early man has gone on display in South Africa.

The Iziko Museum in Cape Town is hosting the standing model of an Australopithecus sediba this week, which was donated by a university in Johannesburg.

It is the first museum in Africa to exhibit a cast of the find.

Ancient: The replica is of a species believed to have walked the earth almost 2million years ago

Australopithecus sediba is from the same biology family as Homo sapiens - humankind - and some experts theorise that the animal eventually evolved into present-day versions of humanity.

The species is thought to have walked the earth around 2million years ago, and could be a crucial step along the evolutionary path to modern man.

The replica skeleton on display - known as 'Karabo' is believed to have belonged to a juvenile male. An adult male, an adult female and three infant skeletons have also been found.

Although the find dates only from 2008, though it was kept secret by researchers for two years until its existence was announced in 2010.

Lee Berger, a paleontologist, was walking with his nine-year-old son Matthew at a dig site near Johannesburg when he found a buried collarbone.

On further digging, researchers found parts of a skull, teeth and most of the rest of the body of the young skeleton, which stands just over 4ft tall.

The fossilised bones, which are remarkably well-preserved, are thought to have been buried when Karabo fell into a deep pit with a soft, sandy bottom which could have buried him.
