USA manager Jurgen Klinsmann has such faith in his team’s chances at the World Cup that he has ordered them to reschedule their flights to after the final on July 13.

Defender Omar Gonzalez has revealed that confidence is flooding through the US ranks after emerging through a group including major nations such as Germany, Portugal and Ghana, and coach Klinsmann now believes that his side can push on in the knockout rounds of the competition.

The USA face Belgium in the round of 16 on Tuesday and Gonzalez has declared that the team have no intention of leaving Brazil any time soon.

'Jurgen has been nothing but positive,’ said Gonzalez, ‘He’s telling us to change our flights to 14-15 July because we’re going to be here until the very end.’

'That just speaks volumes of how positive he is, how much he believes in this team. It trickles down to all of us. That means that we’re all as confident as he is and that we all believe in this team. We plan on being here a few more weeks.’
