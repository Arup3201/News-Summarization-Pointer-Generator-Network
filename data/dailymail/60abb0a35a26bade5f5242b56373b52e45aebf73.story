This surveillance footage captures the sinister moment a Mafia boss lectures 14 of his chosen disciples on the importance of honour, tradition and extortion.

The secret meeting, which resembles a scene from The Godfather, took place in the small, secluded town of Frauenfeld, just north of Zurich in Switzerland.

The clip shows don Antonio Nesci, nicknamed 'the Swiss Mountain', instructing his fellow gangsters on the elaborate and decorated history of the Calabrian 'Ndrangheta gun and drugs Mafia.

Mafia boss Antonio Nesci, nicknamed 'the Swiss Mountain', can be seen with his arms outstretched on the right-hand side of the screen lecturing his new recruits

He tells the men - believed to be new recruits: 'You can work in everything – extortion, cocaine, heroin.

'There is everything, 10 kilos, 20 kilos a day. I will bring it to you personally but then I don't want to know anything more about it.' 

The video was released by Italian police following the arrest of at least 16 'Ndrangheta suspects last Friday, the Independent reports.

The arrests were the culmination of an elaborate police investigation called Operation Helvetia - launched in 2012.

The covert camera footage, which formed a key part of the sting, offers a rare insight into the secret world of the Calabrian Mafia and its unusual rituals.

Translated from Italian, Nesci starts the meeting by announcing: 'I baptise this place - as it was christened by our Spanish knights, Osso Mastrosso and Carcagnosso' who arrived in Calabria 'with irons and chains'.

He then tells the men 'You can work in everything – extortion, cocaine, heroin' after officially baptising the meeting as part of a bizarre tradition

Roughly translated, he later insists 'we are clean, clean – it has taken years to build up this reputation… I repeat again, the society of Frauenfeld is one of honour, wisdom and dignity' 

He then unashamedly talks about the gang's extortion rackets and murders - not included in the video.

Swiss police have called Nesci's gang 'heavyweight operators' heavily involved in hard drugs and weapons dealing. 

Nesci, among those arrested last week, is thought to answer directly to the jailed 'Ndrangheta leader and so-called 'boss of bosses', Domenico Oppedisano, 83.

The small town of Frauenfeld, just north of Zurich in Switzerland - where the Mafia meeting took place

Oppedisano was arrested with 300 other Mafia suspects in Italy in 2010 and is currently serving a 13-year sentence. 

Police obtained evidence with which to convict him after bugging the trees in his Calabrian orange grove. 

Italian police say the Frauenfeld cell was directly answerable to the 'Ndrangheta's rulers in Calabria and there are rumours Nesci also led Mafia operations in southern Germany. 

Police investigators bugged a meeting at a pizzeria in the south German town of Singen in 2009, during which a similar 'baptism ceremony' was held.

Prosecutors in Italy have complained about a lack of action from other European countries in dealing with the 'Ndrangheta, which is now seen as the Mafia's most powerful group.

They claim it took six Italians being brutally executed outside a restaurant in Duisburg in 2007 for German authorities to wake up to the threat.
