He is now one of the world's most recognised celebrities with a string of expensive houses to his name, but when David Beckham bought one of his first properties in the mid-1990s, he was just making his name as a star player for Manchester United.

While his newest digs come in the form of a £30million London mansion, one of his first homes in Worsley, Greater Manchester, has gone under the hammer for a comparatively modest £350,000.

Comprising just four bedrooms, the star sold the home in 1997, shortly before moving into the famous Beckingham Palace in Hertfordshire, which cost £2.5million.

Humble beginnings: One of David Beckham's first houses, a four-bed semi in Worsley, Greater Manchester, has gone on sale for £350,000

The house was bought by the Manchester United footballer in the mid-90s, just as he was becoming a household name before moving on to grander homes

The sporting star sold the property in 1997, shortly before he moved into the famous Beckingham Palace property in Hertfordshire which cost £2.5million

The Beckhams bought the 12-acre estate just three months after their wedding, allowing Brooklyn, 14 and Romeo, 11, and Cruz, eight, to call it home for a few years.

However, as one of the world's most successful footballers, Beckham's career soon forced the family to relocate abroad.

In 2003 the sporting super-star signed for Real Madrid, relocating his wife and children to an exclusive gated community near the city, paying £4.5million for a villa in Las Encinas where third child Cruz, now eight, soon came along.

Up-sizing: David bought the 12-acre estate just after his marriage to Victoria Beckham and the couple raised their children there until their next move in 2003

While Beckham has not lived permanently in the property for many years, it was only sold in 2013 for £12million, netting a £9.5million profit

This villa had seven bedrooms, four bathrooms, a heated outdoor swimming pool, tennis court and extensive grounds. The estate was also surrounded by forest, with residents allowed to hunt wild deer.

The family up-sized in 2007 when Beckham changed clubs again, this time heading for US team LA Galaxy.

Naturally, only a villa in Beverly Hills would do, and the couple paid a reported $22million (£13m) for a 13,000sqft home complete with outdoor swimming pool, five bedrooms and nine bathrooms.

The family's next move was to Spain as David signed for Real Madrid, buying up this villa in one of the most exclusive gated communities in the city for £4.5million

Another foreign mansion was on the cards in 2007 when Beckham again changed clubs, moving to LA Galaxy. This Beverly Hills pad cost a reported $22million (£13m)

In 2013 Beckham made his final move to French side Paris Saint-Germain, and was said to be renting a property in London while searching for a more permanent residence in the city.

At the end of last year the Beckhams announced they were returning to live the capital permanently in the 'New Beckingham Palace', a four-storey, £30million home in central London.

At more than 9,000 square feet, it is one of the largest in its area, boasting eight bedrooms and seven bathrooms.

Now the couple have paid £30million for New Beckingham Palace, a four-storey property in London which is being fitted with its own catwalk and nail salon

Victoria, 39, was said to have instructed the interior designer Kelly Hoppen — who is a friend — to renovate the house with an upper budget of £5 million.

The new interior will include a catwalk, nail salon, secret entrance built into a bookcase and entrance tunnels into the property underneath the 100ft oriental garden out the back.
