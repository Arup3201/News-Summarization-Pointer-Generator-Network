A woman who was dubbed the 'Angel of Woolwich' for confronting the killers of soldier Lee Rigby is facing a police investigation over an allegation of racial abuse.

Ingrid Loyau-Kennett, 49 ,was praised by Prime Minister David Cameron for her actions shortly after Fusilier Rigby, 25, was killed near his barracks in Woolwich, southeast London, in May last year.

But she is now under investigation following claims a Tesco worker was racially abused at a store in Helston, Cornwall.

According to the Sunday Mirror, the incident happened on Friday afternoon.

A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed the force was investigating an allegation of 'verbal racist abuse' at the Tesco store.

A Tesco spokesman said: 'We are aware of an incident which took place at our Helston store on Friday. Colleagues at the store are helping the police with their inquiries.'

Miss Loyau-Kennett received national acclaim for calmly talking to armed Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale after they murdered Fusilier Rigby in the street.

On the first anniversary of the killing, Miss Loyau-Kennett spoke at the scene where she checked Fusilier Rigby's pulse and confronted Adebowale.

She said: 'It has been a waste of three lives and, of course, a year on I still think about Lee Rigby's mother losing a son. It's a tragedy. I don't have flashbacks but I have been very emotional lately.

'This street looks like a normal street now but I can still see the body, see the crashed car and see the bloodied hands.'

Adebolajo, 29, was given a whole life sentence, and Adebowale, 22, told he must serve a minimum of 45 years at the Old Bailey in February.
