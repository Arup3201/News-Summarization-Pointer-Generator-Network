Convicted rapist Ched Evans has pleaded for a second chance in football - and has even claimed he can be 'positive for a club and community'.

Evans, who was freed from prison last Friday after serving two-and-a-half years, has released a video statement in his quest to find a new club.

The Wales striker - who could be offered a way back by former club Sheffield United - appeared alongside his girlfriend Natasha Massey in the video posted on his official website.

Evans was convicted of raping a 19-year-old girl in April 2012, serving two-and-a-half years in prison

Club career

Manchester City (2007-09) - one goal in 16 appearances

Norwich City - loan spell - (2007-08) - 10 goals in 28 appearances

Sheffield United (2009-12) - 42 goals in 103 appearances

International career 

Wales (2008-11) one goal in 13 appearances 

Wearing a black shirt and tie and reading from an autocue, Evans, 25, said: 'I made an incredibly foolish decision and failed those people who trusted and believed in me - most of all Tasha and our families.

'It is a rare and extraordinary privilege to be permitted to play professional football. 

'Now that I have served the custodial part of my sentence of two-and-a-half years it is my hope that I will be able to return to football. If that is possible then I will do so with humility, having learned a very painful lesson.

'I would like a second chance but I know that not everyone will agree. I don't believe I have a given right to play again but for any club to take me on, I have learned a valuable lesson and know that all the time I can prove myself to be a positive influence - not just on the pitch, but also in the community.' 

Evans is unrepentant in the 1min 45sec long video message and says he is determined to 'clear my name' and show that sex with his victim was 'consensual'. 

Evans' last club was  League One outfit Sheffield United before his imprisonment

Evans scored 42 goals in 103 appearances for the Blades during three seasons at the club

'Even though I have been released from prison I am determined to continue the fight to clear my name and it is public knowledge that an application to refer my case back to the Court of Appeal has recently been submitted to the Criminal Case Review Commission by my lawyers. The application seeks to demonstrate that the act I engaged in on that night was consensual in nature and not rape.'

That is the only mention of the word rape, although Evans does call what he did 'a destructive act'. He is more concerned, however, with how it affected his relationship with his partner - who he thanks for standing by him - and not how it has impacted upon his victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons.

'In May 2011, at a hotel in Wales, by cheating on my partner Natasha I hurt the woman I love with all my heart. Since that night I have constantly regretted my act of infidelity and the damage that has been done on so many fronts because of it.

'The support that has been shown by Natasha, our friends and family during the trial and the time spent in prison has kept me strong. It can't have been an easy thing to have stuck by someone who the court found guilty of such a destructive act - I will be forever grateful.'

Evans ends the message by saying: 'Thank you for listening to me'.
