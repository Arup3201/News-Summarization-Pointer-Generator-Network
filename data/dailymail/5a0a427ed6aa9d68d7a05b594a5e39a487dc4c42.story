Just a child’s first steps are a proud moment for any parent, an orphaned pelican’s first real flight was such a big achievement for a group of humans who taught him to fly – that they filmed the moment the giant bird took to the air.

Big Bird the pelican was abandoned by his flock after a storm hit Lake Tanganyika in Tanzania.

The three-month old bird washed up in Greystoke Mahale Park, injured and unable to feed himself.

An orphaned pelican's first real flight was such a big achievement for a group of humans who taught him to fly - that they filmed the moment the giant bird took to the air

The Great White Pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus) breeds from southeastern Europe through Asia and in Africa in swamps and shallow lakes.

In flight, the pelican is an elegant soaring bird.

Males are larger than females, and have a long beak that grows in a downwards arc, as opposed to the shorter, straighter beak of the female.

Male pelicans typically weigh between 12kgs and 15kgs and have a wingspan of around 3.6metres – the second largest of any bird.

As staff helped the ruffled animal recover, they realised Big Bird might not have learned to fly and set about trying to teach him by running up and down the beach with him, flapping their arms to encourage the bird to flap his wings.

‘He didn't fly for some weeks but with encouragement he got the idea. We aren't sure how much flying he may have already done before arriving here but he was pretty shaky in his next attempts on the beach,’ staff wrote on Nomad Tanzania's blog.

‘We would run up and down flapping our arms and simulating flight for him. He would look on curiously until one day he showed us how it was done!’

To capture the moment when Big Bird first took to the air with ease, the staff attached a small GoPro camera to its beak so that the pelican could effectively film himself in flight.

‘We are so proud of him and he is such a clever bird. He can fly!’ they said.

The bird’s first attempts at flying were ‘short and uncontrolled and we would look away when he was landing as he seemed to not distinguish between ground and air speed coming in way too fast and endangering our beach furniture,’ the said.

All the lessons paid off: Big Bird the orphaned pelican films himself flying over a lake in Tanzania

Trying to teach the animal the life skills to survive, park workers also had to feed the pelican, which couldn’t fish without his flock and simply waddled up the beach for help and food five months ago.

The birds do not dive for fish, but instead corral fish by working together as a flock, before scooping the trapped fish into their large stretchy pouches beneath their beaks.

It is thought that Big Bird was separated from his flock after he was sucked into a large cumulonimbus storm cell - vertical clouds producing thunder and torrential rain - and thrown off course on the lake.

Experts said the nearest flock of great white pelicans, to which Big Bird might have belonged, is in Katavi National Park around 93miles (150kms) away from the lakeside park.

After spending so much time with the bird, the experts worked out he is male because of the size and shape of his bill and his pink facial mask.

‘He was all brown when he arrived but the colours are really coming through now and his pouch, legs and face are changing to bright yellow and pink, the colour of the mature birds,’ the workers said.
