Branislav Ivanovic scored the winning goal in Chelsea's 2-1 win against Aston Villa, but the defender looked remarkably sullen in a series of post-match photos.

The 30-year-old featured in a number of snaps with his team-mates, but refused to look at the camera in any of them. 

No reason has been revealed for the bizarre set of photos, but judging by the beaming faces of the other players it's unlikely there's anything serious.

Paul Lambert's Aston Villa finally scored after 11 barren hours during the clash at Villa Park but they still lost to the Premier League leaders.

Eden Hazard opened the scoring before Jores Okore equalised, but Villa hearts were broken in the second half when Ivanovic scored the winner.

After Manchester City's draw with Hull, Jose Mourinho's men are now seven points clear at the top of the table.
