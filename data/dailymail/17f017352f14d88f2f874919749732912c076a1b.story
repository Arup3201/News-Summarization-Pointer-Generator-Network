A 'monster' mother whose toddler died after she subjected him to months of terrifying violent abuse has been jailed for at least 18 years today.

Two-year-old Keanu Williams, who was known to police and children’s services, was beaten to death by Rebecca Shuttleworth, who was given a life sentence this afternoon.

Keanu was found dead with 37 injuries including bite marks, a fractured skull and a fist-sized tear in his stomach.

He was hit repeatedly with a stick or rod over 48 hours and died of internal bleeding, a post-mortem examination found.

Paramedics discovered his body at the 
home of Shuttleworth’s then boyfriend, Luke Southerton, 32.

Shuttleworth, who was sentenced by Mr Justice Spencer at Birmingham Crown Court, had also been found guilty of four counts of child cruelty.

The judge, who also passed concurrent sentences for child cruelty totalling four years, told Shuttleworth: 'The jury have convicted you of the brutal murder of your two-year-old son.

'He was a defenceless child and it was your duty to protect him. Instead you beat him so severely he died a lingering death from his injuries a day or so later.

'You have also been convicted of cruelty by failing to summon the medical aid he so badly needed.'

Paying tribute to Keanu, the judge added: 'He was a delightful little boy described as a real character, a little entertainer who remained cheerful despite everything.

'Joyful was the word that more than one witness used to describe him - he was a favourite at nursery as well as within the family.

'His death has left a void in many live which will never be filled.'

Although the judge accepted that Shuttleworth had experienced her share of tragedy in losing her mother and grandmother following a 'troubling' upbringing, he said she had shown a cruel and vicious streak towards Keanu.

As Shuttleworth wept in the dock, the judge added: 'By the jury's verdict, you alone were responsible for the violence which led to Keanu's death.

'One can scarcely imagine the pain and distress Keanu must have suffered from this outburst of violence.

'He must have been terrified, it must have been clear to you as soon as the violence had taken place that Keanu was badly in need of medical attention.'

but convicted of cruelty

Shuttleworth had decided not to seek medical help because she knew his injuries, including internal bleeding to his abdomen, could not be explained away, the judge said.

Explaining how he had arrived at the 18-year minimum term, the judge said the murder was aggravated by several factors.

Outlining some of the aggravating features of the case, the judge told Shuttleworth: 'Keanu was particularly vulnerable because of his age.

'His was a lingering death over many hours following a brutal assault by his own mother.

'This was the grossest abuse of a position of trust - you were his mother and it was your most basic and natural duty to protect him.

'I accept that there was no intention to kill but this was a brutal and sustained attack.'

Shuttleworth's partner, Luke Southerton, was cleared of murder, manslaughter and causing or allowing the death of a child, but convicted of one incident of cruelty towards Keanu during which he was bitten, apparently in an attempt to stop him biting other people.

Southerton, 32, was given a nine-month jail term suspended for two years, and ordered to complete 200 hours of unpaid work for the community.

A review has
 begun into why social workers failed to spot the abuse.

Keanu’s injuries were not ‘isolated’ but part of a long chain of abuse by his mother, who now faces life behind bars.

Yet Shuttleworth, 25, had duped officials into thinking she was ‘caring and competent’.

It adds to questions about children’s 
services at Labour-run Birmingham City Council, rated ‘inadequate’ since
 2009 after deaths of children known to social workers.

Cases include 
that of seven-year-old Khyra Ishaq, starved to death in 2008.

Last month the department was labelled ‘utter chaos’ by members of its own watchdog.

Yesterday Jane Held, head of the 
Birmingham Safeguarding Children Board, which is reviewing Keanu’s 
death, said social services, medics and police ‘missed a significant 
number of opportunities to intervene’.

Birmingham Crown Court heard that Shuttleworth had ‘resented’ Keanu virtually from his birth in 2008.

Shuttleworth, who was living with 
Keanu’s father in Torquay, Devon, saw the child as an ‘obstruction to 
living her life as she wanted’, the jury was told.

Prosecutor Christopher Hotten QC said 
she spent much of her childhood in care as her alcoholic mother 
struggled to cope, giving her ‘considerable experience of the care 
system’.

Keanu Williams' family has been 'torn apart' by his death, according to his aunt.

Angela Shuttleworth, 26, Rebecca Shuttleworth's sister, said the death of the toddler who was known in the family as Kiwi had left 'a gaping hole in our lives'.

In a statement she said: 'Keanu was an amazing little boy who had developed a real personality.

'He was full of life and loved playing with his siblings and cousins. He enjoyed all his toys and would empty the toy box every time he came to play, but he especially loved Iggle Piggle from (children's television programme) In The Night Garden .

'Kiwi also loved food - he ate everything and was hungry all the time.'

She added: 'Since the tragic death of Kiwi, we haven't been able to grieve or say goodbye to him properly.

'The whole family has been torn apart by this and his death has left a gaping hole in our lives.

'We hope now this is over we can lay Kiwi to rest and begin to have some closure.'

Following Keanu’s birth she received 
‘extensive’ support from health and social workers, posing as an 
‘attentive’ mother at parenting classes.

She moved back to her home city of Birmingham when Keanu was 15 months old, starting a relationship with Southerton.

Mr Hotten said Shuttleworth used her 
knowledge of the care system to ‘manipulate social workers, teachers, 
doctors and care professionals to believe that she was a competent and 
caring mother’.

She told staff at the child’s nursery his bruises came 
from bumps or falls.

In December 2010, she took Keanu to hospital with burned feet, which she claimed came from a radiator beside his bed.

She was told police would inspect her home, and texted Southerton to make sure their stories matched up.

A month later, paramedics found the 
boy dead at the flat in the deprived Ward End suburb.

The couple had 
dialled 999, claiming Keanu had had a heart attack.

Mr Hotten told the 
jury Shuttleworth hoped he would ‘get better’ and only called 999 when 
she realised it was hopeless.

Detective Chief Inspector Caroline 
Marsh, who led the investigation for West Midlands Police, said: ‘In the
 past, I have described her as a monster and perhaps I would stand by 
that.’

The force would not comment on its prior involvement in the case because of the review.

Southerton was cleared of murder, 
manslaughter and causing or allowing the death, but convicted of cruelty
 yesterday after a six-month trial.

Shuttleworth, who was convicted of four counts of child cruelty as well as murder, will be sentenced alongside him today.

She has been on bail throughout the case and attended court with a woman she was heard to describe as her ‘partner’.
