Prostate cancer – the most  common form of the disease in men – is bottom of the league  for research spending, figures reveal.

The disease lies in 20th place, with just over £400 spent on research per case diagnosed. Breast cancer, the most common cancer in women, receives £853 per diagnosed case.

The figures from the Prostate Cancer UK charity show the disease is ‘not on the radar’ for research spending.

Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer in men but is bottom of the league for research spending

Just £17million was spent by government and charitable sources in 2011, which works out at £417 for each of the 40,841 men diagnosed with the disease that year.

In contrast, breast cancer has the highest research funding of any cancer at £41.6million, with leukaemia receiving the most per patient (£3,903).

Prostate cancer kills one man every hour and the number of men with the disease is rising at an alarming rate. It is predicted to become the most common cancer in the UK by 2030.

Comedian Bill Bailey, whose father-in-law was diagnosed with the disease, is fronting a fund-raising campaign by Prostate Cancer UK

Owen Sharp, chief executive of Prostate Cancer UK, said: ‘Men in the UK have a problem and they don’t want to talk about it.

‘Neither do the wives and partners who will end up supporting them, the doctors who will treat them, nor the politicians who will count on their vote. Prostate cancer is simply not on the radar. We need to follow the lead of the successful female movement against breast cancer and create a real change for men.’

Comedian Bill Bailey is fronting a new fund-raising campaign by Prostate Cancer UK in a series of adverts.

He said: ‘My father-in-law was diagnosed with prostate cancer, treated, and now leads a fulfilling life – but over 10,000 men every year in the UK are not so lucky.’

Mr Sharp added: ‘We are  going to need a very big sledgehammer to crack prostate cancer. This is more than a campaign. It is a call to arms.  Men deserve better.’
