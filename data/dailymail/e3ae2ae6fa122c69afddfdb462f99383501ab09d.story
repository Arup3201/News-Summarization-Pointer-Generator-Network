Illusionist Sam Powers has pulled off a world first levitation above the waters of Sydney Harbour.

Sam conquered his fear of sharks to stun passing ferry passengers at McMahon's Point in the shadow of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

He successfully levitated last year's Big Brother runner up and model Jade Albany almost two feet above the water. 

'We almost got washed away a couple of times, but if you are a real magician, you should be able to make magic happen anywhere,' he said.

Despite his fears of sharks, illusionist Sam Powers decided to give the levitation at Sydney Harbour a go and pulled it off

'I am terrified of sharks and I did see a sting ray, but my fear and adrenalin rush to do something that has never been done before made it all the more exciting.'

The whole experience left his subject shaking.

'Sam put me in some sort of trance and the next thing I knew, I was hovering a couple of feet above the Harbour, with the waves washing my hair,' said the 24 year old. 

'It was incredible and a bit scary, even though I'm a good swimmer.' 

'I was literally shaking from the experience when Sam carried me back to dry land. I've no idea how he did it.'

Sam is about to join the largest magic show on earth called 'The Illusionists 2.0' where he will join six of the world's best magicians currently on a world tour.
