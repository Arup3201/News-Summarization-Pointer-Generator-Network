Holland is on a collision course with the EU over a threat to deport Poles and other Eastern Europeans who cannot find work.

Ministers in the Hague also want to withhold migrants’ state benefits if they don’t speak Dutch.

Brussels fears that other countries experiencing an influx of jobseekers from member states might be tempted to copy the Netherlands’ threat, even though such a move would breach EU laws.

Dutch social affairs minister Henk 
Kamp has presented proposals to expel Polish and other Eastern European 
nationals who are without work for three months and have little prospect
 of finding any.

He also plans to withhold welfare  benefits from those who have not  learned Dutch.

The moves are likely to breach rules protecting freedom of work and movement for people within the EU.

Holland has about 200,000 migrant 
workers from Eastern Europe. Although this figure is far less than for 
some other countries – such as the million-plus who have come to Britain
 since Eastern European accession to the EU in 2004 – the number is 
growing rapidly.

Poland's European affairs minister Mikolaj Dowgielewicz says there have been 'robust talks' with the Netherlands on the plan

Poland’s economic affairs minister 
Waldemar Pawlak called the Dutch plans ‘worrying’, adding: ‘This 
development is dangerous and could lead to the collapse of the European 
system of freedom  of movement.’

Poland’s European affairs minister 
Mikolaj Dowgielewicz said there have been ‘robust talks’ with the 
Netherlands on the proposals.

Poland took over the presidency of the EU last Friday for the next six months.

Europe’s justice commissioner Viviane
 Reding has warned the Netherlands that it ‘must respect EU rules on the
 freedom of movement between member states’. If the Netherlands fails to
 comply with EU legislation, the commission will make its position ‘loud
 and clear’, she said. ‘All member states are equal and the rules are 
transparent,’ she added.

All people within the EU have a right
 to freedom of movement and work as long as they are either working or 
are self-sufficient in funding.

The accession countries partially 
enjoyed these rights after 2004, and have fully done so since the end of
 the ‘transition’ period in May this year.

This means it is likely to be illegal
 for Holland to carry out the proposals, particularly those which relate
 to language requirements.

While countries like Britain have 
rigidly stuck to EU laws and directives, other nations have been less 
circumspect on doing so, and in many cases go unpunished.

Other than receiving a rebuke from 
the European Commission, they could eventually be dragged through the 
European Court of Justice in Luxembourg – which could take many years.

Poland’s ambassador to the Netherlands said recent anti-Polish statements by politicians there ‘border on discrimination’.

There is a growing discontent with 
labour migrants in the Netherlands, where  Poles are accused misusing 
the social  benefit system.

In 2007 there were 20,000 Poles 
there, now there are close to 200,000, according to figures from the 
Polish Embassy in the country.

The rise has prompted a number of 
factories in the Netherlands to use Polish to communicate, with signs 
written in the language as well as the hiring of Polish managerial 
staff.
