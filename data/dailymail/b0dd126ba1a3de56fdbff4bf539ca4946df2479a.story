Jack Wilshere has not suffered a setback in his bid to recover from an ankle injury, insists Arsenal's communications director.

Mark Gonnella took to Twitter on Monday to deny that the Gunners and England midfielder would now be out for longer than the originally-diagnosed period of 12 weeks after reports last week had claimed he could be out until May.

The 22-year-old damaged ankle ligaments during the 2-1 loss against Manchester United at the Emirates in November and then underwent surgery to repair the injury.

And he is expected to be out until at least February as a result of the injury - but the club's communications director insists the timeframe for Wilshere's remains the same as it was before.

Gonnella took to Twitter to explain: 'Jack Wilshere has not had a setback.

'On schedule for return to squad as per original plan. 12 weeks from injury.'
