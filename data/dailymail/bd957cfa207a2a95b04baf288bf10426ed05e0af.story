Police have been given the names of doctors who are accused of being in league with Jimmy Savile.

One doctor allegedly ‘collaborated’ with the BBC star in selecting child patients to rape at Leeds General Infirmary.

Two others worked at Stoke Mandeville, the Buckinghamshire hospital where nurses warned children to ‘pretend to be asleep’ when Savile toured the wards.

Yesterday a child-abusing retired Stoke Mandeville consultant, Dr Michael Salmon, was in hiding after a woman reported him to police for allegedly groping her in 1982.

The woman, now 42, told the Mail that Dr Salmon, who displayed a Jim’ll Fix It picture in his office, squeezed her breast while pretending to check her heartbeat to treat her migraines. She said: ‘I was only 12 but quite well endowed. I was so shocked.’

Eight years later, in 1990, the paediatrician was jailed for indecently assaulting three other girls, two aged 13 and one of 17.

He served three years in prison and now lives in retirement with his wife Mary, 70, in a £750,000 cottage in the heart of the New Forest in Hampshire.

Salmon, 77, was ‘unavailable’ for comment, said his wife, adding: ‘He is not here. He has gone away.’

A neighbour said Salmon had been keeping a low profile recently, adding: ‘He has been trying to avoid journalists for the past couple of weeks.’

Dr Raymond Brown, who worked as a consultant paediatrician with Salmon, said the doctor would have known Savile because everyone at Stoke Mandeville knew him.

The hospital has refused to answer a long list of questions put by the Mail, including whether the £40million Savile raised for it made him ‘untouchable’.

At Leeds General Infirmary, two former women patients have come forward to name a doctor. He is accused of ‘brutal rape’.

The National Association for  People 
Abused in Childhood charity said: ‘One of the victims has  said Jimmy 
and this doctor used to collaborate in choosing girls and taking them 
somewhere else to abuse them.’

Leeds
 General Infirmary said it had ‘not been passed any information about a 
specific allegation or the name of an individual, so understandably we 
cannot say any more about this.’

Stoke
 Mandeville said it was ‘shocked and saddened to hear of the very 
serious allegations’ and was co-operating with police inquiries.

Now 51, the woman said she was a 20-year-old volunteer at the hospital when Savile lured her into his room and attacked her.

She said: ‘I counted him as a friend as we had worked together at the hospital for a long time and I trusted him.

‘He was very strong and forceful when he realised I was resisting him. After it happened he told me not to tell anyone because he said no one would believe me.’

Following publication of this article, Dr
 Salmon contacted the PCC to say that although he worked at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, he was based at a separate campus to Savile. We are also happy to clarify that Dr Salmon never met or had dealings with Savile.
