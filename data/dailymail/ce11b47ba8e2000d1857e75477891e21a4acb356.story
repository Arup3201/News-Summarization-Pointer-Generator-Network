Tottenham and Manchester United fought out a post-Christmas stalemate as Hugo Lloris starred for the hosts in goal while Radamel Falcao struggled to show his predatory best up front.

United boss Louis van Gaal considered the result the loss of two points while Spurs' Mauricio Pochettino will feel fortunate to have salvaged a point from the scoreless draw.

Sportsmail's Riath Al-Samarrai was at White Hart Lane and assessed all of the players' performances. 

Tottenham keeper Hugo Lloris made the difference with saves such as this from Robin van Persie

TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR (4-2-3-1):

Hugo Lloris – Saved by Chiriches in first half but solid, as always. A number of fine saves, the best of which was his acrobatic swipe at a Young shot. Never faltered on the routine stops. Made the difference. 8

Vlad Chiriches – Superb last-ditch clearance off the line in first half after Mata free-kick came back off the post, but struggled to contain Young. 6

Fearless star man Lloris made a number of fine saves and was faultless on routine stops

Federico Fazio – Still capable of passing to no-one when under little pressure, but managed a number of decent challenges. 6

Jan Vertonghen – Not helped by Pochettino’s high defensive line and part of a unit that failed to win enough balls into the box. 6

Ben Davies – Had an easier afternoon than Chiriches and dealt comfortably with Valencia. Solid but rarely allowed to utilise his ability to get forward. 6

Ben Davies was solid for Spurs at left back but was rarely able to impose himself going forward

Benjamin Stambouli - Booked for first-half foul on Carrick and kicked out at Jones after the break. Along with Mason, never got hold of midfield. 5.5

Ryan Mason – Good in the tackle, but too wasteful in possession. When he was teed up by a lovely Kane pass in second half, he was way off target. 5.5

Andros Townsend – Impressive start and made a good chance for Kane, but faded badly. Needed to offer Chiriches more help in dealing with Young. Booked for fouling Young. 6

Andros Townsend started impressively and made a chance for Harry Kane but faded badly at the end

Christian Eriksen – Barely noticed he was on the pitch until late free-kick that at least got De Gea moving. Improved in second half but needed to look for ball more. 5.5

Nacer Chadli – Replaced by Lamela after an ineffective performance. Had scope to target a suspect defence but lacked service and made little use of ball when it did come. 5

Harry Kane – One reasonable first-half chance from a Townsend pass that he failed to connect with properly, but played a superb ball for Mason late on which could have settled it. 6

A rare day for Harry Kane in that it came without a goal and almost won it for Spurs with an assist

Substitutes: Lamela for Chadli (78), Dembele for Townsend (79)

Subs not used: Walker, Paulinho, Soldado, Vorm, Dier

Manager: Mauricio Pochettino - His side improved, but odd to see him do so little when United were dominating the first half. His defence and its high line looked at times like an accident waiting to happen. 6

MANCHESTER UNITED (3-4-1-2):

David De Gea – Sharp but generally untested. Saved from Townsend in first half and also kept out Eriksen’s late free-kick. 6

Keeper David de Gea makes what is eventually a routine save in a match where he was rarely tested

Phil Jones – Not much to do at the back and had a goal ruled out at the other end. Fine challenge to deny Fazio in second half. 6.5

Paddy McNair – Not convincing in possession and played himself into trouble in first half. Silly booking for body-checking Kane and replaced by Luke Shaw. 5

Jonny Evans – Targeted early on by Townsend but held his own well. Replaced by Smalling. 6

United defender Phil Jones (right) made a fine second-half challenge on Fazio (left) in the second half

Antonio Valencia – Quiet first half and replaced by Rafael Da Silva at half-time. Never tested Davies. 5.5

Michael Carrick – Lofted an utterly magnificent pass into Van Persie path at the end of the first half. Always composed and always looking for runs. 7.5

Wayne Rooney – Excelled in his deep role in first half, having plenty of possession and a great source of tempo for United. But fluffed a first-half header and struggled to get in game in second half. Lucky not to conceded penalty for grappling Kane in the box. 6.5

Wayne Rooney excelled in his deep role but fluffed his lines when he had good opportunities in attack

Ashley Young – His revival continues. Thrived in the space created by Tottenham’ s high defensive line and forced a stunning first-half save from Lloris. Some good work defensively, as well. Booked for tripping Chadli. 7

Juan Mata – Stunning free-kick deflected off wall onto post in first half and showed his usual excellent range of passing. 7.5

Radamel Falcao – Disappointing. Frequently lost possession because of poor touches and sent a weak shot straight at Lloris in first hald. For such a renowned predator, he never looked dangerous. Booked. 4

For such a renowned predator, Radamel Falcao never looked dangerous up front for United

Robin van Persie – Nearly scored a Bergkamp-esque goal in first half after bringing down Carrick pass on his toe but failed to get a shot off. Also ballooned a volley over early in second half. 5

Substitutes: Da Silva for Valencia (45). Booked. Shaw for McNair (76) Smalling for Evans (72)

Subs not used: Lindegaard, Fletcher, Pereira, Wilson.

Manager: Louis van Gaal - Curiously, the Dutchman only introduced defenders from the bench, perhaps because his side was tiring so noticeably in the second half. 6.5
