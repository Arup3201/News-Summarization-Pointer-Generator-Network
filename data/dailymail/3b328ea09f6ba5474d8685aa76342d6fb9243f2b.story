Three American climbers have become the first in the world to conquer the Shark's Fin - a lethal 20,000ft pinnacle.

The dare-devil trio of Conrad Anker, Jimmy Chin and Renan Ozturk spent 11 days scaling up the jagged near vertical point on Meru Central in the Himalayas.

Dubbed one of the hardest climbs in the world, dozens of professional climbers had been defeated by the tricky summit - with one breaking both legs during an attempt. But the American climbers successfully negotiated the 20,700ft climb - sleeping in a hanging tent thousands of feet above the ground.

The climb was 
Conrad Anker's third attempt to find a route up Shark's Fin, and the 
second attempt for both Jimmy Chin and Renan Ozturk. Combining their three attempts,
he trio has accumulated thirty-plus days on the mountain.Â 

Meru Peak is located in the Himalayas in Nepal, a mountain with a lethal 20,000ft pinnacle

Mr
Anker first tried the ascent in 2003. HIs team turned back two-thirds 
of the way up as a result of deep, unconsolidated snow and a lack of 
proper equipment for the upper wall. The following year set a new highpoint on the Fin at 6100m, but descended after one of the team broke both his legs.

Anker made his 
second attempt with Chin and Ozturk in 2008.

The team was 
delayed on the climb for several days during a storm but later they progressed beyond the highpoint of Anker's 
2003 attempt.

But the team food supply had run short as a result of the storm and on their nineteenth day 
they stopped about 150 metres below summit. Chin vowed never to return.

The following year a Slovenian team attempted the 
same route but the weather meant they were unable to acclimatise on practise routes first.

Nevertheless, they decided to press ahead.

After the two-day approach the team 
turned aback, citing a lack of proper equipment, poor acclimatization and 
their alpine-style approach as mistakes for an attempt on the Shark's 
Fin.

After an epic 22-day climb up a near-vertical Himalayan peak, an Australian couple in their 40s took just two minutes to "fly" back to base camp and smash the world record for the highest BASE jump in history.

In 2006 Australians Glenn Singleman & Heather Swan both wearing 
'wing suits' - launched themselves off a 6604-metre high precipice on 
Meru Peak after a 22-day climb.

Their expedition was made up of six climbers and nine porters. They covered 50 metres a day on icy slopes at 80 degree gradients and in temperatures of -20.

BASE jumping, also sometimes written as B.A.S.E. jumping, is an activity where participants jump from fixed objects and use a parachute to break their fall. 'BASE' is an acronym that stands for four categories of fixed objects from which one can jump: buildings, antennas, spans (bridges), and earth (cliffs).

Earlier this month a Norwegian man plunged 1,000 feet to
his death when his parachute failed to open after he struck a vertical 
cliff and spiraled out of control.

Eiliv Ruud, 37 was taking part in a BASE jump near the Grand Canyon, but two other jumpers were forced to watch helplessly as the stunt went tragically wrong. Mr Ruud's parachute failed to deploy 
fully, and the contact caused him to spiral down the rest 
of the way.
