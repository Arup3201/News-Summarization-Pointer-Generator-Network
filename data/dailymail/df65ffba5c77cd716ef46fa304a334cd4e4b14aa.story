Whereas some of us might moan about our commute taking up a few hours of every day, spare a thought for those who make astonishing journeys across hundreds of miles just to get to work.

The ‘super-commuter’, who works in one city but lives in another, is on the rise in the U.S. and especially in Houston and Dallas in Texas, where they make up 13 per cent of the workforce.

They are followed by Phoenix, Arizona; Atlanta, Georgia; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which all have seven to eight per cent of their workforce based outside the city’s statistical area.

Changing patterns: The 'super-commuter', who works in one city but lives in another, is on the rise in the U.S. and especially in Houston and Dallas in Texas, where they make up 13 per cent of the workforce. The stars in this diagram represent major cities and the circle sizes represent other cities where the workforce comes from

New York: The report found U.S. super-commuters tend to be aged less than 29 years old and while 'twin cities' in the past were typically 40 miles apart they can now be  up to 200 miles apart. The circles represent other cities from which people commute into Manhattan, and their size shows the rise in local long-distance commuters

Los Angeles: Around 10,000 workers travel 400 miles south from Sacramento to the famous California city

Karl Sparre, 56, of Boston, right, makes the 600-mile $130 round trip to Philadelphia every week. He gets a 7:20am flight to Pennsylvania on Monday and is home in Massachusetts by 7:30pm on Friday. His plane ticket cost will soon go up to $220.

The father works for food services company Aramark and drives or takes the train to and from his sister’s house in Wilmington, Delaware, during the week - a journey which takes an hour.

He once had a 30-minute drive to work for financial firm Sun Life in Boston before he lost his job, failed to find work locally and decided to take the Philadelphia job a year ago.

‘The super-commuter typically travels once or twice weekly for work, and is a rapidly growing part of our workforce,’ wrote the authors of a New York University report released last week.

They cite changing advances in wireless technology as one major reason for this shift, with many employees working on their way to and from work, and living in cheaper areas to their office’s city.

In addition many qualified workers don’t want to sell their homes and move if they are offered a new job - but do want to take the employment offer with the jobless rate still at 8.3 per cent in the U.S.

‘The global economy has rendered the clock irrelevant,’ the Rudin Center for Transportation report said. ‘The workplace is no longer fixed in one location, but rather where the worker is situated.’

Areas where workers in one city live 
have expanded to other cities and metropolitan areas often hundreds of 
miles apart, which is resulting in greater economic integration, the 
report said.

This is seen for example in Los 
Angeles, California, where 10,000 workers travel 400 miles from 
Sacramento - and in Chicago, Illinois, where 5,000 workers travel 300 
miles from St. Louis, Missouri.

Super-commutes
from Dallas to Houston in Texas had more than tripled in 2009 compared 
to 2002, and they had doubled between Northern California and Los 
Angeles, as well as from Boston, Massachusetts, to Manhattan, New York.

Southwest Airlines runs an astonishing
25 flights a day on the 240-mile route between Houston and Dallas, 
which is effectively a bus service shipping commuters across Texas, 
reported Bloomberg.

The 
report found U.S. super-commuters tend to be aged less than 29 years old
and while ‘twin cities’ in the past were typically 40 miles apart they 
can now stretch up to 200 miles away from each other.

Transport methods: Super-commuters travel up, down and across the U.S. between cities by car, plane and train to get to work each week
