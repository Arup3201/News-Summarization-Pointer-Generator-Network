Pickup drivers should be on alert after newly released research revealed the top ten most stolen vehicles in the country is dominated by trucks.

A popular misconception is that sports cars and luxury vehicles dominate such a list, but research released by the Highway Data Loss Institute shows thieves are most interested in pickups.

The research, released Tuesday, covers the period 2010 to 2012 and is based on insurance claims.Pickups accounted for the first five vehicles on the list and the most stolen of all is the Ford F-250 pickup, a heavy-duty version of the top-selling F-150 that is popular with contractors. 

Popular model: The Ford F-250 Super Duty Power Stroke diesel pickup truck has been named the most popular vehicle to be stolen

On average, 1.2 of every 1,000 insured vehicles are reported stolen in the U.S. in a given year. However the Ford F-250 had a claim frequency of seven per 1,000 insured vehicles, almost six times the average.

The F-250 replaces the Cadillac Escalade, which had been the most stolen vehicle for the past six years in a row. The Escalade fell to sixth on the list, a drop attributed partly to the SUV’s improved anti-theft features and partly due to declining sales.

The top ten is also dominated by vehicles manufactured by General Motors, with the other two entries being Fords.

Theft rates in general are declining, thanks in large part to the spread of ignition immobilizers, which prevent vehicles from being hot-wired and were standard in 89 percent of 2012 models.

The Ford F-250 has replaced the Cadillac Escalade as the favorite target of thieves, the Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI) reports

The Dodge Journey tops the list for the least-stolen vehicles, which tend to be less popular models

Fewer pickups than cars or SUVs have the feature as standard, which may help explain the higher theft rates for pickups.

Pickups and large SUVs are also expensive to buy, so it reasons that thieves would want to chop them up for parts to sell them on the black market.

The rankings also don’t distinguish whether or not the entire car was stolen, or if the car was simply broken into. Since it is probably easier to steal something from the bed of a truck this may also go some way to explaining the number of dominance of trucks in the top ten.

The best way to defeat car thieves may be simply to buy a vehicle nobody else wants. The HDLI has also compiled a list of the least-stolen vehicles.

The Chevrolet Silverado pickup is the second most stolen vehicle with 6.7 per 1,000 insured

This list is dominated by relatively unpopular products or lower-volume luxury models, such as the Audi A4.

But there also are some more popular vehicles, like the Honda CR-V, ranked seventh from the bottom, that may benefit from improved anti-theft technologies.

For car buyers, it might be tempting to consider a vehicle that’s least likely to be stolen, but it’s worth keeping in mind that thieves probably ignore some cars because they’re not worth much and there may simply be little demand for its parts.

Lexus stopped selling the HS 250 because of poor sales. The Dodge Journey and Jeep Compass are weak sellers that will soon be discontinued as well, reports The Exchange.
