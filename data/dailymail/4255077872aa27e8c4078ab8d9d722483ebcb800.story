Virginia State Senator Creigh Deeds was discharged from hospital Friday morning, three days after being stabbed multiple times by his troubled son at their Bath County home.

The son, 24-year-old Austin 'Gus' Deeds, turned a rifle on his himself moments after brutally attacking his father on Tuesday during an altercation out front of their house.

Gus had undergone a psychiatric evaluation one day earlier and was set to be committed, however a bed could not be located for him in a Virginia mental health ward.

Deeds, 55, was able to walk out of the home and down a hill on his property to Route 42, where he was picked up by a cousin who happened to be driving by.

Deeds was airlifted to UVa. Medical Center, where he was initially listed in critical condition, however has since made an impressive recovery and was allowed home Friday morning.

From home he spoke for the first time since the incident, Tweeting: 'I am alive so must live. Some wounds won't heal. Your prays and your friendship are important to me.'

'I'm so relieved he's doing better, but the tragedy is that he'll be living with this for the rest of his life,' Va. Sen. Janet Howell, a friend and colleague of Deeds, told NBC Washington.

Virginia State Police have confirmed they are treating the incident as an attempted murder and suicide and said it occurred about 7.25am Tuesday.

But they have not commented on a motive.

Troopers and first responders attempted to treat Gus Deeds, but he died at the scene. His body was taken to the medical examiner in Roanoke for an autopsy.

Creigh Deeds has now been able to speak to investigators.

The incident has raised new questions about the capacity of Virginia's mental health system.

On Monday, Gus was evaluated by psychiatrists in Williamsburg after an emergency commitment order was filed against him.

He was only released because there was no room for him at any psychiatric wards in western Virginia.

Now the Washington Post is reporting thatÂ  three hospitals within a two-hour drive of Bath County did have beds available, and two of the three say they were never contacted by the Rockbridge County Community Services Board trying to find a placement for Deeds son.

The state inspector general has now launched an investigation to find out what led to Gus Deeds' release after the custody order was issued.

'Regardless of whether or not there were beds, there was not a system to determine if there were beds available,' Howell said.

Gus had been a student at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, which he attended off-and-on since 2007. He took a semester off school in 2009 to help his father with his losing campaign for governor.

He was enrolled this year, but withdrew from the university last month. Administrators said he was a music major with a 'strong academic record.'

On his Facebook page, Gus listed his political views as: 'Too busy with love to care.' He was one of four children of 55-year-old Deeds.

Gus was arrested for alcohol possession in May 2009 when hew was 20 after police caught him at a house party near his home.

Colleagues of Sen. Deeds said they've heard of difficulties with his son but never imagined an outcome like this.

Gus Deeds was found alive in the house, but he died 
before he could be stabilized and put on a helicopter.

Despite his extensive wounds and extensive blood loss, Deeds - who was considered critical upon arrival at hospital - has been able to speak with investigators and give them information about the attack.

Deeds rose to national fame during the 
2009 Virginia governor's race in which he lost by a landslide of nearly 
18 percentage points to Bob McDonnell.

He and his wife of two decades, Pam, 
divorced in February 2010 after the embarrassing loss turned him into a 
punchline in some political circles.

Deeds said his marriage to Pam, right, fell apart because of the rigors of his political career. The two divorced in February 2010

In 2010 he told the Washington Post that the divorce was 'a casualty of a nearly 20-year pursuit of a lifelong ambition that kept him away from home.'

He married Siobhan Lomax in a quiet ceremony in June 2012.

Lomax,
44, owns a boutique near the campus of Washington and Lee University in
Lexington, Virginia, where Deeds has been a visiting law professor 
since 2010.

Condolences immediately began to pour for Deeds and his family.

Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Shultz tweeted: 'Thinking and praying for Creigh Deeds and his entire family. He's a great man and public servant.'

Governor Bob McDonnell, a Republican who beat Deeds in the governor's race in 2009 and for attorney general in 2005, also offered his condolences.

'In this tough and sad time, our thoughts and prayers are with the Deeds family. The news from this morning is utterly heartbreaking,' McDonnell said in a statement.

'Creigh Deeds is an exceptional and committed public servant who has always done what he believes is best for Virginia and who gives his all to public service.'
