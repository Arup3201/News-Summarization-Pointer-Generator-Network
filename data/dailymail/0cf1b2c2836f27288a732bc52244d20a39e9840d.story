Holidaymakers hunting winter sun breaks are  choosing destinations by whatever is trending on Twitter.

For the first time holiday experts found Britons appear to be selecting winter breaks after checking on the social media site for the most talked about resorts and cities.

TravelSupermarket researchers discovered not only were two holiday spots in Morocco the most popular destinations for UK travellers - they were also the favourite trending 'holiday' words on Twitter.

5. Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia 

6. Costa Rica, Central America

The travel comparison site reviewed site data for uplifts in bookings and web searches, then compared the results against social mentions on Twitter.

Now they have published their first ever top 10 list of 'on trend' winter escapes.

They claim the popularity of Agadir and Tangier, in Morocco, is down to the short distance in flights from the UK to Northern Africa.

A new direct flight path from the UK to Agadir has seen site searches soar by 226 per cent compared to this time last year.

Bob Atkinson, travel expert from TravelSupermarket, said: 'Social media is changing the world all the time.

'We've identified the top ten up and coming winter sun destinations for people who want to try something new this season.

'Our findings highlight that it's not so much the destination you visit but the experience it can offer and how people can make the most of it.' 

For those looking for a more urban feel, Abu Dhabi, UAE, has also seen spikes in searches
