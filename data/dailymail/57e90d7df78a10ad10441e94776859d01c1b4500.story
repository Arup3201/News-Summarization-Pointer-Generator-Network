Wales' oldest schoolboy rugby fixture has been suspended over teachers' fears that the boys on one team had become so much bigger and better at the game than the others.

The match between private schools Llandovery College and Christ College, Brecon, has been called off for the first time in more than 130 years over worries the boys are now mismatched.

This schools say a difference in emphasis between the schools - Llandovery excels at sport whereas Christ College concentrates more on academia - means that the Llandovery boys have become bigger, stronger, and thus a danger to those from Christ College.

Llandovery College and Christ College, Brecon, have called off their historic rugby match over fears the Llandovery boys will hurt their smaller rivals. Picture shows the Christ College 1st XV in 1965/66

The pupils at Christ College, Brecon, are concentrating less on rugby and more on a broader mix of sports and study

Guy Ayling, headmaster at Llandovery College, said: 'The pupils are devastated, but we are not shy about being outstanding at rugby; we are enormously proud of our teams, and their pursuit of excellence is quite inspirational.

'Since the advent of the professional game in rugby, the two schools have taken different routes, and it has been increasingly difficult to ensure a safe and competitive game as a result.

'It has therefore been decided by both schools that we should suspend the fixtures in senior rugby for the time being.'

He added: 'Both schools are committed to reviewing this decision regularly, and if the day comes when the fixture can once more be played in a way that is both competitive and safe, the match may become a part of the calendar once more.'

The clash has historically been the centrepiece of the sporting calendar for both mid-Wales schools.

The first match in 1879 took place two years before the Welsh Rugby Union was launched.

But recently Christ College has paid less importance to the game, and turned pupils' focus instead to other sports and academic achievement.

This has led to a 'widening physical gulf' between the two teams creating fears someone could soon be seriously injured.

The gap between the two sides was highlighted in 2009 when 17-stone juggernaut George North appeared for Llandovery - just a year before his Wales international debut.

Other notable former Llandovery pupils include rugby stars Alun Wyn Jones and Andy Powell.

Llandovery has enjoyed a 15-year unbeaten run in the fixture but the clash has maintained its popularity at both schools.

Emma Taylor, head of Christ College Brecon, said: 'Llandovery's rugby side is very big and very strong and we admire them for that.

'At Christ College we go for wider range of sports with a real emphasis of academic provision at the core of what we do.Â  Sport is very important, including rugby, but with a slightly different emphasis than Llandovery.

'Therefore our senior squad, on average, is generally made up of younger and less experienced players.

'The decision to suspend the fixture is exactly that, a suspension, and I certainly don't see it as the end of the story.'

The rugby fixtures in younger age groups and fixtures at all levels in other sports will continue to be played.

Back in 1888/89, the Christ College 1st XV was a good match for the team from Llandovery, but no longer
