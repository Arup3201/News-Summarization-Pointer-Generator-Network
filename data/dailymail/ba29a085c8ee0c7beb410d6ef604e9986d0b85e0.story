Lazio midfielder Joseph Minala has been cleared to resume his career after proving he's not a 42-year-old masquerading as a youth team player.

The Italian FA launched an investigation after an African football website claimed that Cameroon-born Minala was pretending to be 17 and had altered his passport to take a full 25 years of his actual birth date

That led to an official investigation which saw him questioned by the league's federal prosecutor.

Lazio and Minala's agent rubbished claims that he was a cheat, producing the paper work to prove he was the correct age.

'Lazio denounce this latest attempt from hostile figures to throw a sinister light on this club,' said a club statement.

'We
 reserve the right to take action against those responsible for the 
protection of the good name of the company and the footballer.'

Minala
 has had to block photos on his Instagram account and delete his 
Facebook profile because of the abuse he got over the pictures.

His agent, Diego Tavano, told Italian 
newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport: 'He had a difficult time growing up. 
If you talk to him you'll realise he is in every way a 17-year-old lad.'

Minala
 still has a Twitter account and after the age storm sent the following 
message: 'Envy is the weakness of man, and those with a poor soul hurt 
others when you are in Serie A. Love you! Forza Lazio.'
