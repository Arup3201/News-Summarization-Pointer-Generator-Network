Tragic accident: Oaklee Sidwell died after being blown away on a trampoline

A nine-year-old Utah girl has died in a freak accident when a gust of wind caught the trampoline she was on and blew her more than 150ft away.

Oaklee Sidwell had been playing with friends in her backyard in Panguitch on Tuesday when a sudden gust sent the trampoline she was sitting on airborne.

Although the trampoline was properly anchored to the ground and had a safety net, it was still picked up and carried away. 

The animal-loving schoolgirl was 
rushed to Salt Lake City Hospital after falling from the trampoline, 
which was lifted high into the air, but she died the next day from 
multiple injuries.

Garfield
County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Cheryl Church described the incident 
as a freak accident and added: 'This is nobody’s fault'.

'So
many people are feeling heartbreak for [the family],' Ms Church told The Salt Lake Tribune. 'It’s hard to even wrap your head around it.'

Oaklee was the only person on the trampoline at the time of the accident. She was sitting on it as she put her shoes back on.

A memorial page set up for Oaklee recalled a kind-hearted girl who loved to help her father, Tracy, and enjoyed nurturing animals.

She had recently been caring for a baby jack rabbit found by a dog, and was syringe feeding it to nurse it back to health.

The memorial page added: 'Oaklee was here with us for nine wonderful years and was so full of life. She lived it to the fullest and shared her happiness with everyone around her.'

Loss: The small community where Oaklee lived is mourning the death of the nine-year-old

As well as enjoying outdoor pursuits 
with her two older brothers, Oaklee was said have also enjoyed shopping 
trips with her mother Desiree.

Ms Church told KSL: 'Panguitch is not a huge city and everyone knows the family. This tragedy that has affected the entire community.'

A memorial fund has been set up for the Sidwell family at Zion Bank.
