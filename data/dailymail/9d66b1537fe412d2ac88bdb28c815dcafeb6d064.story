Guilty: PC Alan King has been jailed for three years after having sex with a lover in his marked car

A married police officer has been jailed for three years after having sex with a witness in his patrol car while he was on duty. 

PC Alan King, 48, also seized cannabis from a suspect to smoke with his lover - but the 'house of cards' fell when the suspect himself told other officers about the deal, a court heard.

Father-of-two King texted 'Happy Birthday' to Zoe Barham, 36, after he was called to an incident at the branch of Betfred where she worked in Gravesend, Kent.

After swapping messages, the pair embarked on an affair and had sex in King's marked car, in an alleyway and at Ms Barham's home.

King later used force computers to run an unauthorised background check on Ms Barham to see if she would be a suitable girlfriend.

But the affair fell apart when he struck a corrupt deal at the scene of a stabbing in Gravesend, Kent.

King was the first on the scene of the incident, in which a man was stabbed in the neck, and confiscated a bag of cannabis before taking the victim to hospital.

He then told suspect Martin Reid that he would drop all charges - if he could keep the illegal drugs.

He and Ms Barham smoked the drugs together after King asked her if she wanted 'cannabis, weed or green', the court heard.

But Mr Reid later gave a description of the officer who had done the deal, and 'the House Of Cards began to fall'.

King, of Hoo, Kent, had admitted the affair but denied misconduct in a public office, perverting the course of justice and supplying drugs - claiming Ms Barham was a 'woman scorned'.

But a jury at Canterbury Crown Court found King - who had been in line for a bravery award - guilty of all charges and he was jailed for three years.

Judge Adele Williams told him: 'Police officers should be beyond reproach. They should be people that the public can look up to and have confidence in that they will uphold the law.

'But you broke the law and perverted the course of justice.'

As he was sent down, his 25-year career in tatters, King blew a kiss to his wife in the public gallery from which his son shouted: 'Love you dad.'

The court heard Mr King met Ms Barham, who thought he was single, in June 2011 when he was called to an incident at the betting shop.

He took a statement and mobile number from Ms Barham and became a frequent visitor to the shop in the following week, chatting to her about her upcoming birthday.

The relationship then began after she received his unsolicited birthday wishes. 

'He gave me his personal number because he wanted to start a relationship,' she said. 'I wasn't aware about his relationship at first but I did suspect after a little while [he was married].

'He would turn up in his marked police car and if I was at work we would just talk and have a fag.

'He would sometimes take me to my home in Gravesend in his police car.

'On one occasion he took me up an alley in Barr Road where we had sexual intercourse in his police car. That happened on several occasions.

'Mr King picked me up in his police car and took me there and he was in uniform. I went there because I was in a relationship with him.

'He promised me everything. He promised me a lot. He told me he loved me and I believed him at the time.'

King took her with him on three occasions while he was investigating incidents, the court heard, and she was allowed to input information into the vehicle's police computer.  

King also admitted during the trial he had used the police system, 'Genesis', to search for details on Ms Barham.

The court was told the officer was being routinely vetted and did not want anything bad emerging that could damage his reputation.

The affair ended when the two were arrested in relation to an alleged fraud, although no charges were brought in relation to that suspected offence.

Ms Barham then told police about the drugs and her affair.

After the sentencing, a Kent Police spokesman said: 'We acknowledge the sentence imposed on Police Constable Alan King after he was found guilty of misconduct in a public office, perverting the course of justice and supply of class B drugs.

'PC King will now face a disciplinary hearing and until such time that the hearing has concluded, it would be inappropriate to comment any further.'
