A 15-year-old girl who disappeared on her way to school earlier this month is believed to have been abducted, police say.

Sierra LaMar was reported missing by her mother on March 16, having never made it to the bus or her Morgan, Hill California high school on that fateful day.

After initially allowing for the possibility that Sierra ran away from the home she shared with her mother and her mother's boyfriend, the 40 detectives assigned to the case are saying they now believe it is highly unlikely that she vanished voluntarily.

Mystery: Sierra Lamar, 15, disappeared on the walk to her school's bus stop last Friday morning in Morgan Hill, California

Their conclusion was based on Sierra not having a history as a runaway or any unusually negative family problems. Interviews with friends and a search of her computer also yielded no information indicating she fled.

A day after her disappearance, sheriff's deputies found Sierra's cellphone, an electronic window into her world which now sits in a San Jose crime lab undergoing forensic tests.

It was in a field near where she normally caught a school bus in Morgan Hill, a semi-rural community of 40,240 on the fringes of Silicon Valley surrounded by mountains, orchards and reservoirs.

For her family and many of the 583 volunteers who turned out to search for her, Sierra's abandoned phone wiped away thoughts that she ran away.

'A teenage girl without her phone? No way,' said Gwen Dorcich, a mother of two teenagers who showed up at a vacant elementary school that was transformed into the search command center to sign up as a volunteer. 'If she was planning to run away, she was going to tell friends that.'

So far, however, the investigation has provided more questions than clues.

Clues: Her mother snapped this photo of her the morning she disappeared, appearing playful which followed her parents and friends' perception of nothing out of the ordinary

Santa Clara Sheriff’s Office Sgt. Jose Cardoza told ABC News: 'The first week the focus was on the public’s help for possible 
sightings. Now the focus is to call us with people that 
are suspicious in the neighborhood. We don’t know where she could be in 
the area, but we are thinking that whoever is involved either lives in 
Morgan Hills area or has a familiarity with the area.'

The day after deputies located her 
Samsung Galaxy smartphone, they came across Sierra's handbag a few 
blocks away. Several items of her clothing - a San Jose Sharks T-shirt, 
pants and undergarments - were folded neatly inside.

Tracking dogs lost her scent at the 
end of the driveway of her home on a cul-de-sac, leading investigators 
to hypothesize she never got much further.

'This seems like a very remote 
location, and it seems like anybody who would have been there had to 
have a reason to be there,' said Marc Klaas, whose 12-year-old daughter 
Polly was kidnapped from her Northern California home in 1993 and 
murdered.

'Therefore, my immediate thought was: 
Whatever happened to Sierra, assuming she did not run away, happened on 
this block,' he said.

A missing children's foundation he 
founded in his daughter's memory is organizing searches in the city, 
about 25 miles south of San Jose. Of the 46 similar searches the 
KlaasKids Foundation for Children organized last year, 37 resulted in 
either a victim being found alive or their remains located, he said.

The law enforcement response has 
included searching the homes of neighbors, contacting registered sex 
offenders, interviewing friends and relatives, and stopping drivers who 
travel the road where Sierra picked up the bus and where her phone and 
purse were found to ask if they saw anything unusual.

On Tuesday, a sheriff's team boarded a
boat with a cadaver dog to search the shores of Calero Lake, a 
reservoir and teen hangout, while volunteers walked the surrounding 
brush-covered slopes in a line formation.

A weekend search by the sheriff's 
department and the FBI covered a 12-square-mile radius from Sierra's 
home. It included canyons and hillsides off major highways that could 
provide a place to dump something in a hurry, Cardoza said.

People have called in tips about seeing a girl matching Sierra's description, he said, but none had panned out.

'We do not know what she was wearing 
when she left the house, we don't know when she left the house because 
no one saw her do it, and we have not had any new credible leads or tips
or evidence since discovering the bag of clothes,' Cardoza said. 'There
has been... so many unknowns.'

Marlene LaMar told investigators she last saw her daughter when she left for work about 6am on March 16.

Just before 6:30am, when Sierra 
ordinarily got ready for school, the teenager tweeted. A friend received
a routine text message from her about 40 minutes later, the time she 
usually left home to catch the bus, authorities said.

But investigators have not found anything to signal where to look now.

The MacBook she got for her birthday 
has not provided any hints about where she might be. The night before 
she disappeared, she tweeted that she planned to write a school essay 
about teen depression and suicide. That same week, she tweeted: 
'suiiiiicide im tooo aliiiiive kill ya sellf.'

Sierra and her mother have been living
in Morgan Hill since October. Tonya Miller, a family friend, said 
Sierra appeared to have adjusted to the move, briefly joining a private 
cheerleading club and befriending the daughter of her mother's 
boyfriend.

The sheriff's department said neither Marlene LaMar nor her boyfriend is considered a suspect.

Authorities also absolved Sierra's 
father, Steve LaMar, a registered sex offender convicted in 2009 of one 
count of lewd or lascivious conduct with a child under 14. The victim 
was not Sierra or her older sister. Police say he is cooperating in the 
investigation and is not a suspect.

'I'm not going to hide it. It is very important they interview me, I get cleared and cooperate with everything,' LaMar said.

The night before Sierra went missing, 
she asked her father to make an appointment to get her hair highlighted.
He said he texted her the next day to say he had, but never got a 
reply.

When investigators reported finding 
the phone, Steve LaMar said, 'That was pretty disturbing because we know
that she is 15 years old and she loved that phone and was always on it.
We would get mad at her for being on it at dinner.'

Among the hundreds of volunteers Tuesday were several who endured the same ordeal as Sierra's family.

One was retired San Jose Police 
Officer Pat Boyd. His 28-year-old daughter, Cristie Wilson, disappeared 
from a Sacramento-area casino in 2005. A man who gambled at the casino 
that night has been convicted in her murder, but her body never was 
found.

On Tuesday, Boyd stood in the command 
center, explaining to volunteers returning from a fruitless search that 
their effort was still valuable not just to investigators trying to 
narrow the territory they have to cover but also Sierra's parents, who 
have only question marks.

'Do I hope and pray she is just a 
misguided teenager and ran away? Yes, that is my number one hope,' he 
said. 'Number two is that somebody did abduct her and is keeping her 
alive somewhere. And the last is that at least the family gets closure 
by finding out who did it and where she is.'
