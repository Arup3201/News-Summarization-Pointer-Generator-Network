An elderly grandmother died of pneumonia after yobs hurled a breeze block through her window – leaving her exposed to freezing temperatures on the coldest night of the year.

June Green, 83, who had been the victim of three previous burglaries, stayed in her bedroom when she heard the noise and spent the next 12 hours huddled under blankets not daring to investigate.

Raiders waited until she was asleep before entering the bungalow where she lived alone to steal a handbag containing a purse with around £60 cash from the bedroom.

Five days after the break-in the widow developed pneumonia and was taken to hospital by ambulance. She died on Sunday – exactly a week later.

Her family say police initially refused to attend the council house in Doncaster because it was a ‘damage only’ incident.

However, action was only taken after the purse was found two days later at a local supermarket and Mrs Green’s daughter Gail Benson-Green complained.

A police community support officer went to the property 90 minutes after Mrs Green's carer called the police to reassure her and carry out house to house enquiries. 

Yesterday Mrs Benson-Green, 59, blamed her mother’s death on the burglars – who are still being hunted.

‘I think the fact the window had been broken and she was left cold and in fear after what had happened are responsible for my mum’s death,’ she said.

Mrs Green, a mother of two, had lived alone since her husband Neville, an engineer, died more than 20 years ago but was visited by carers. According to her daughter she had suffered three burglaries in the last decade – the latest about two years ago when jewellery was stolen by a conman who tricked her into briefly leaving the property.

In the latest incident last month the pensioner was startled by the bang as the living room window was smashed and called her daughter, who lives 250 miles away in Gosport, Hampshire.

Mrs Benson-Green, who claims her mother could have been killed by the breeze block had she not gone to bed early that night, said: ‘She didn’t seem to have realised the enormity of what had happened and the seriousness of the situation.

‘She must have just stayed in the bedroom and we now know that later on someone was hovering over her bed to steal her handbag which is always left in the same place near the bed.’

Temperatures that night plunged to around -6C, the coldest night of the year in England.

The next morning Mrs Green’s carer called the police after arriving to find the window smashed and damage to the room.

But even though there were scuff marks, officers allegedly refused to come out because it was not known if anything was missing. The following day Mrs Benson-Green was called by her local Asda supermarket where her mother’s purse had been found – with the cash missing.

The pensioner was not told that burglars had crept into her bedroom for fear of upsetting her. But she realised her handbag was missing when she was about to be taken to hospital with a chest infection. ‘It was the last conversation I ever had with her and she was very distressed,’ said Mrs Benson-Green. Yesterday a police spokesman said inquiries into the ‘reported burglary’ were continuing, adding: ‘No arrests have been made and police continue to appeal for information.’

Last night the broken and boarded window had yet to be replaced with glass.
