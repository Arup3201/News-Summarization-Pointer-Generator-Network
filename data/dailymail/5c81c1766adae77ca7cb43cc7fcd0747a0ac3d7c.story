A man who admitted on Facebook that he had 'hurt someone' has been jailed for at least 20 years for brutally knifing his neighbour to death.

Barry Estabrook, 44, stabbed 'gentle giant' Brian Knock, 38, more than 20 times in his garden in an apparently motiveless attack after they'd both been out drinking at their local pub.

Shortly after killing popular Mr Knock in the early hours of September 1, Estabrook posted messages on Facebook saying he had 'really hurt someone' and also told his sister he thought he had killed someone.

Killer: Barry Estabrook, 44, stabbed 'gentle giant' Brian Knock, 38, more than 20 times after a night out at the pub. He told his sister that he thought he'd killed someone and she found Mr Knock dead

It was his sister, who lived locally, who ran to Mr Knock's home and found him dead.

She discovered the 'cheeky, fun-loving' father-of-two slumped against the front wall of the house he shared with his mother after her brother's onslaught.

Estabrook, of Bildeston, Suffolk, yesterday admitted murdering his fellow villager.

'Gentle giant': Brian Knock was 'larger than life'. He was stabbed 20 times by Estabrook who had no motive for the attack

He was ordered to serve a minimum of 20 years behind bars of a mandatory life sentence at Ipswich Crown Court.

Judge David Goodin said both men had been drinking separately at the Red Lion in Bildeston.

The judge said Mr Knock had had a great deal to drink and was described by witnesses as 'exuberant and playful' while Estabrook was 'scowling and aggressive'.

Judge Goodin said Estabrook may have been irritated by Mr Knock's behaviour in the pub but it did not justify what happened later.

He said Mr Knock was a 'gentle giant' and because of the drink he was in no fit state to defend himself from the 'murderous onslaught' he met that night.

Christopher Morgan, prosecuting, said Mr Knock had been visited by his two daughters on August 31 and before leaving them with his mother Lola to go to the Red Lion he had told them he loved them.Mr Morgan said: 'His mother and daughters were never to see him alive again.'

He said Mr Knock was happy in the pub and had not been aggressive or argumentative.Estabrook had gone to the pub with a woman neighbour.

During the evening she had gone outside and had a cigarette with Mr Knock.

At one point Mr Knock had put his hands on Estabrook's head and he had told him to get off, the court heard.

Later that night the landlord heard Estabrook say he was going to 'fill him (Mr Knock) in'.

Estabrook told another punter he was going round to Mr Knock's home to 'have it out with him' and when he was advised to leave it until the next day Estabrook replied : 'No. I'm going to go round tonight.'

Estabrook left the pub at about 2am.

He was dropped off at his flat by a member of the pub's staff and Mr Knock had left the pub at about the same time and walked home with a friend.

Mr Morgan said the victim was murdered in his front garden by Estabrook between 2am and 4am in a 'frenzied' and apparently motiveless attack.

Red Lion: Both men had been drinking separately at the Red Lion in Bildeston, Suffolk before the murder

He said Estabrook's horrified sister found Mr Knock dead after she was alerted by her brother.

She knocked at the front door and Mr Knock's mother came out and said: 'Oh my God. It's my son.'

Estabrook had sped off and his car was found a short while later after he'd ploughed into a hedge.

The killer was found hiding in a ditch and was Tasered by police who feared he had a knife on him.

Cops went to his home and found his clothes, mobile and a kitchen knife in a washing machine.

Steven Dyble, defending, said both Estabrook and Mr Knock had been drinking that night.

He said although Estabrook had been heard to say he was going to 'do Mr Knock in' he hadn't said he was going to kill him.

Mr Dyble said there was very little to explain why Estabrook had killed Mr Knock.

He was ordered to serve a minimum  20 years behind bars of a mandatory life sentence at Ipswich Crown Court

He admitted: 'In many ways it is without motive.'

Mr Dyble said Estabrook had expressed remorse and realised how many people's lives he had wrecked.

Det Insp Kevin Hayward, of the joint Norfolk and Suffolk major investigation team, said last night: 'This was a particularly brutal attack where a defenceless man sustained horrendous fatal injuries.'

Mr Knock's family have paid tribute to him, saying he had a 'big smile and a big heart'.

His loved ones said he was a devoted son, loyal friend and brother who enjoyed spending time with his nieces and nephews.

His family said in a statement: 'He was a big tough man on the outside but a big softy underneath who was not afraid to tell those close to him how much he loved them, or to cry and show his sadness and to laugh out loud when happy.

'Brian was a cheeky, fun-loving character with a big smile and a big heart.

'Loved by all that knew him, he will be missed beyond words.

'His life was short but he made such a big impression on everyone that he will be remembered in the memories and hearts of all that ever had the good fortune to meet him.'
