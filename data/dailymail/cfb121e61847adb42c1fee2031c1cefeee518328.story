A missing captain who may have abandoned his fishing boat when it got stranded off a popular San Francisco beach also has an outstanding warrant for his arrest, authorities said Tuesday.

A $75,000 arrest warrant was issued in 2012 for Timothy Lybrand of Santa Cruz when he violated probation by failing to appear in court, records say.

He was arrested and convicted for possessing drugs and drug paraphernalia in 2010, Santa Clara County sheriff's Sgt. Kurtis Stenderup said.

The revelation comes a day after the Coast Guard called off its hourslong search for Lybrand, 51, after scouring an area around San Francisco's Ocean Beach where his 40-foot vessel ran aground in 10-foot-deep waters.

Have you seen me?  The Coast Guard suspended its search for Lybrand, a captain who may have abandoned his fishing boat early Monday when it got stranded off a popular San Francisco beach. Lybrand has a warrant out for his arrest

Stuck: Lybrand's fishing vessel The Paloma is stuck in the breakers of Ocean Beach on Monday

A salvage operations team pulled the partially capsized boat close to shore Tuesday but did not see Lybrand inside, Lt. Theo Vaughan said.

There are no plans to continue looking for him, 'unless we get additional information that he's in the water,' Vaughan said.

Crews worked Tuesday to remove the boat 
and hoped late afternoon high tides would help propel it to shore. There
 was a smell of diesel fuel in the air but no visible signs of sheen in 
the water, Vaughan said.

The Coast Guard called off its search around noon Monday after a helicopter, two boats and a beach rover looked for the missing captain. 

Search crews, including the Coast Guard, 
the National Park Service and the San Francisco Fire Department, 
patrolled an 18-square-mile radius from Ocean Beach to the iconic Golden
 Gate Bridge to no avail.

Convicted: He was arrested and convicted for possessing drugs and drug paraphernalia in 2010

'The decision to suspend a search and rescue case is always difficult,' Capt. Mike Day said. 'Given
 the close proximity to shore, and the vessel operator's stated 
intention to abandon the vessel, as well as the extensive search effort.
 ... I have made the decision to suspend the active search.'

The captain apparently made a call from his vessel to other nearby boaters asking for help around 3:30 a.m. Monday — about an hour after he left shore, Lt. Cmdr Shawn Lansing said.

'(Lybrand) said he was 'on the rocks' and considered getting off the vessel,' said Lansing, who added that Lyband intimated that he would try to swim to shore while wearing a life jacket.

Lybrand's vessel is registered with the Port of San Francisco, spokeswoman Renee Dunn Martin said. He usually fishes alone along the California coastline, she said.

Larry Collins, president of the San Francisco Community Fishing Association, said Tuesday that Lybrand has been fishing for more than 30 years.

'We're all worried. We care about him. He's a fine guy, a real good fisherman,' Collins said. 'We hope he ran ashore. We'd like to know if he made it.'
