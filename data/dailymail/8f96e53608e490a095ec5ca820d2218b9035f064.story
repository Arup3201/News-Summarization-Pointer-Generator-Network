Road deaths and serious injuries are on the rise after years of falling, damning new Government figures revealed today. 

It throws into reverse the Government’s road safety strategy and bucks the longer term trend of falling casualties. 

It was also described as ‘alarming’ and ‘a scandal’ by road safety campaigners – with cyclists, motorcyclists and children bearing the brunt.

Wake up call: There was a 9 per cent increase in the number of children killed or seriously injured and a 12 per cent increase in total child casualties in spring of this year compared to the same period last year

Officials blamed 'warmer weather' for bringing out more ‘vulnerable’ road users such as cyclists onto the nation’s highways, as well as increasing levels of traffic.

But RAC external affairs head Pete Williams said: "The increase in road casualties is alarming, especially the statistics that show a rise in the number of child casualties.’ 

The new figures show that total casualties – comprising deaths, serious injuries and slight injuries - rose by 9 per cent to 48,020 from April to June this year compared to the same quarter last year. 

The number of people killed and seriously injured – known as ‘KSI’ and used by safety officials as the benchmark for measuring performance - rose by 7 per cent to 6,280 for spring 2014. 

This was despite the quarterly figure of 440 deaths being practically unchanged from the 439 for the same period last year. Slight injuries in Spring 2014 rose 9per cent to 41,740.

The provisional figures from the Department for Transport  also show that total casualties across Britain for the 12 months ending in June were 4per cent higher than the previous year at 193,290. 

Those killed or seriously injured were also up by 4 per cent to 24,580. And the number of fatalities alone rose 3per cent from 1,713 to 1,760.Slight injuries rose 4per cent to 168,710.

In spring 2014 there was a 9per cent increase in the number of children killed or seriously injured and a 12per cent increase in total child casualties. 

Child pedestrians killed or seriously injured rose by 1per cent and total child pedestrian casualties were up 3per cent. 

There was also a big increase in the number of cyclists killed or seriously injured - up 18 per cent compared to a 9 per cent rise in motorcyclists for the quarter.

The Department for Transport said warmer weather in spring 2014 compared with spring 2013 may have increased the number of vulnerable road users, particularly motorcyclists and pedal cyclists, on the roads. 

It added that traffic levels in spring 2014 were 0.8per cent higher than in spring 2013 which could also partly explain the casualty increases. 

Car users killed or seriously injured were up 8per cent. But the number of pedestrians killed or seriously injured in spring 2014 was down by 1per cent - the only road-user group to show such a decrease. 

Cycling groups were concerned that in the 12 months to June the number of cyclists killed or seriously injured rose 10 per cent. 

British Cycling's policy adviser and former Olympic cycling champion Chris Boardman said: ‘A 10 per cent increase is a stat that should act as a wake-up call to the Department for Transport instead of simply being explained about by the milder weather we've seen in the last year.’ 

Mr Boardman said: ‘It's great that more people are choosing cycling as a means of transport but the reality of Britain's roads will be putting millions more off.’ 

AA president Edmund King said: ‘Although the good weather and increase in traffic may have had an impact, that will be scant consolation for those who have lost a loved one or been injured on our roads.’ 

Claire Francis, policy head at transport charity Sustrans, said cycling casualty figures showed ‘our roads aren't safe enough’. She added: ‘We are failing to enable our children to get to school safely. It's no wonder that more and more are being ferried to school by car. It's a scandal that this is allowed to continue .’ 

Transport Minister Robert Goodwill said: ‘Any death on the road is a tragedy and improving safety is an absolute priority for this government. While there remains a significant long-term decline in casualties and Britain's roads are among the safest in the world, there is absolutely no room for complacency.’
