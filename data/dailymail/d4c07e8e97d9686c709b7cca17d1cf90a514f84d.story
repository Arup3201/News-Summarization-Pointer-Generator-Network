Question marks were raised over the future of the BBC licence fee yesterday as it emerged growing numbers of young people are using free catch-up services instead of watching live television.

Figures revealed viewers aged between 16 and 24 now spend just half their time watching shows as they are broadcast.

The rest of the time they use free catch-up services such as BBC iPlayer, as well as DVDs, recorded TV programmes or films and shows they have bought and downloaded via the internet.

Fears are growing that 16 to 24-year-olds are watching TV mostly on iPlayer and dodging the annual licence fee

The trend has sparked fears that younger viewers are deliberately dodging the £145.50 annual charge, which only applies to those who watch or record live TV and does not cover iPlayer.

The BBC is coming under intense pressure to close the loophole which allows catch-up shows to be watched free of charge, amid concerns older viewers are effectively being penalised for watching on traditional TV sets rather than tablets, smartphones and laptops.

The vast majority of older viewers still watch their favourite shows as they are broadcast, meaning they are obliged to pay the licence fee. 

According to figures published yesterday by Ofcom, just three per cent of the viewing of those aged between 55 and 64 is on catch-up platforms such as iPlayer, while 80 per cent is live.

On average, adults spent an average of two hours 58 minutes a day watching live television. Catch-up services are much more popular with the young, accounting for seven per cent of their viewing time. 

Just three per cent of 16 to 24-year-olds said they would miss watching live TV, compared to 31 per cent of those aged over 65.

In recent years the BBC has encouraged growing numbers of viewers to watch its TV shows on iPlayer but has yet to close the loophole that makes catch-up viewing free of charge.

BBC iPlayer attracted 234million hits in February this year, which was a 21 per cent increase in just 12 months

And earlier this year, the corporation’s director-general Tony Hall announced plans to close youth channel BBC3 and put all of its content on iPlayer.

The catch-up platform attracted 234million hits in February this year, a 21 per cent increase in a year.

Although Lord Hall has said he wants to close the iPlayer loophole and extend the licence fee to catch-up TV, insiders claim such a change would be hard to enforce.

As the BBC currently has no way of checking who watches iPlayer, it would have to issue every genuine licence fee payer with a code before they can access the website.

In June, the Daily Mail revealed two million households have told the BBC they do not need a TV licence because they do not have TV sets and do not watch live programmes.

The number of people who have legally opted out of the charge has risen by almost 40,000 in the past two years, prompting claims the corporation is struggling to adapt to the internet age.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘As the data shows young people still spend two thirds of their viewing time watching live or recorded TV which needs to be covered by a TV Licence. Well under two per cent of households watch only catch-up TV.’ 

UK adults spend more time in front of screens or on the phone than they do sleeping.

We spend an average of eight hours and 41 minutes every day on our phones or computers, compared with eight hours and 21 minutes asleep.

The figure rises to nine hours and eight minutes among those aged 16 to 24, Ofcom said.

And when multi-tasking is taken into account – such as using Twitter while watching TV – we spend an average of 11 hours a day using new technology, an increase of two hours since 2010.

However, the research also showed that the time spent watching TV has fallen.

Last year we spent an average of three hours and 52 minutes a day in front of our television sets.

In 2012 the average was four hours and one minute. It was the first time since 2009 that TV viewing has fallen below four hours a day.
