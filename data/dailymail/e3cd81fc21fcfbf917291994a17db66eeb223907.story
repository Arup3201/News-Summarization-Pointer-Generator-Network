A talented graphic designer 
who builds fantastical LEGO sculptures in his spare time has teamed up 
with a publishing giant for a new book.

Mike Doyle, a husband and father-of-two from New Jersey, developed Beautiful LEGO with NoStarch Press to showcase the most creative toy brick 'builds' by designers from around the world, out now.

It features eye-popping designs such as mythical dragons, imagined galactic cities and storm-battered houses.

Doyle re-discovered Legos four years 
ago after visiting Legoland with his two sons and then cruising around 
the internet to see what other people were doing.

'Builds' - as they’re known to their creators - can take hundreds of hours to produce.

Doyle is now an internationally renowned sculptor of LEGO custom creations. He is known for his stunningly realistic, grand-scale design, and he posts pictures of his builds on his blog.

He now builds ever building larger and larger 
houses that have an increasing amount of detail and several hundred 
thousand pieces. He includes his own work in the new book.

'To my eyes, patterns of decay find a
more pleasing path than an untouched object,' writes Doyle of his two 
storey house with basement sculpture.

'A
roof collapsed by the weight of snow, side shingles ripped by the force
of winds, substructures rotting, insects and weather gnawing the 
exposed surfaces.

'I can picture those windy days where a 
shingle flies off. Or the sudden creaking, cracking and burst of tinder 
giving way under snow's heavy hand.'

Doyle has curated more than 200 pages of the world's best Lego art for the new book, which is around 280 pages and has close to 360 builds and 400 images.

Contact, the majestic fantasy cityscape featured on this book’s cover, uses more than 200,000 bricks.

His
award-winning Abandoned House series has been showcased at Gallery1988 
in LA and now has a home in Boston’s Museum of Realist Art.

'Every year this stuff gets more and more 
intricate and the technique gets better, so I thought it would be great 
to celebrate the merits of the medium,' Doyle tells Wired.

The appeal for him is the ability to 'go 
beyond the medium.'

At some point, he says Legos stop being the subject,
and instead just become a tool.

Like a painter seeing beyond the paint 
to envision the painting. He calls it a kind of 'transcendence'.
