Prince Harry’s presence is enough to turn the First Lady into something resembling a giggling teenager.

So when Britain’s most eligible bachelor kissed gold, silver and bronze medal winners at the Warrior Games this weekend, you can hardly blame them for their beaming smiles.

The 28-year-old royal charmed crowds when he arrived in Washington last week, creating scenes of hysteria worthy of a pop star.

And on Sunday he continued to woo young Americans, congratulating Lacey Hamilton, who won gold in a cycling race at Colorado Springs, with a kiss.

The prince proceeded to kiss the US Army’s Margaux Mange after presenting her with her silver medal for the Women’s Bicycle Open.

And if that wasn’t enough, bronze medal-winning Ashley Crandall also received a peck on the cheek.

Harry has continued to win hearts on his seven-day tour along America’s east coast.

During a visit to the White House last
Thursday he received glowing praise from Michelle Obama for serving his
country in the British Army and for supporting America’s wounded 
soldiers.

He spent the 
weekend promoting the Warrior Games in which British servicemen and 
women have been competing in Paralympic-style events against a large US 
team and troops from other countries.

Last
time Harry was in the US, he was photographed naked in Las Vegas as he 
played strip billiards with a group of women in his £5,000-a-night 
suite.

The
two men will take a ride through Manhattan on a new London Routemaster 
bus to kick off a two-year promotional campaign around the world.
