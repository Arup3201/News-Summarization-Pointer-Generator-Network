When we read about social media in the news, it’s rarely for a good reason. Last week footballer-turned-pundit Stan Collymore was ‘declaring war’ on ‘vile internet trolls’ – those who write abusive things in order to bully others online.

But another battle being waged  on sites including Twitter, Facebook and YouTube caught my attention last week: a campaign urging the public to come forward and ‘swab 4margot’.

On the sites, enchanting images  of a gorgeous red-haired toddler  are emblazoned with the words: ‘Margot Needs You.’

Save Margot: The family of 17-month-old Margot Martini, who was diagnosed with a very rare type of leukaemia last year, has started a campaign to find a donor match for her

The adorable little girl in question is 17-month-old Margot Martini, who was diagnosed last October with a very rare type of leukaemia.

In order to have a chance of a cure she needs a stem cell donor – previously called a bone marrow  donor. No relatives are a match,  so the search has had to be opened up to the world, through social media.

Actually registering as a donor is an incredibly simple process.

On the website deletebloodcancer.org.uk, you can order an at-home mouth swab kit. Once done and  sent off, it is processed in a lab and your tissue type can be determined and placed on a register.

Although 90,000 Britons have now registered, only half of the 1,600 patients currently on the stem  cell donor waiting list will find a match. For the others, sadly, there  is little hope.

Support: Gary Barlow is just one of several celebrities, and thousands of ordinary people, who are helping spread the word about Margot's plight

A YouTube video of Margot, with  a haunting soundtrack by pop star Ellie Goulding, has now been viewed more than 55,000 times. It is watched 1,000 times a day.

Boosting awareness, the Martinis’ Twitter campaign has been  retweeted by celebrities with  huge followings such as Stephen Fry, Richard Branson, Gary Barlow and Ronnie Wood, while Margot’s Facebook page has more than  8,000 likes.

In the first two weeks of the campaign, 12,000 people requested a swab kit from Delete Blood Cancer – a huge number in that timeframe. And even if a match for Margot  isn’t found, then many others like her could benefit.

This sort of campaign represents a sea change in the world of health.

Of course, finding a donor in such circumstances, even in the digital age, is a Herculean task, but less than a decade ago the outlook for desperately sick babies such as Margot, or adults in need of similar treatment, was far bleaker.

Social media is a massive boon in what
 is essentially a numbers game – the more people who register as donors,
 the more chance those on transplant waiting lists who are perilously 
ill will be helped.

It is all about improving the statistics, and the only way to do that is  to tell more and more people.

Some
 20 years ago I signed up as a stem cell donor in response to the Sue 
Harris Campaign. Sue was a young woman with leukaemia who spoke at more 
than 150 events across Britain to raise awareness  of her plight.

For leukaemia patients, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are very effective in getting rid of cancer in the blood.

But the aggressive treatment attacks all cells that divide rapidly (as cancer cells do) and destroys healthy bone marrow – the soft tissues inside the bones that create red blood cells.

For the patient to survive the process, new bone marrow – stem cells – must be put back into the bones.

There are two ways to donate: either under general anaesthetic, when stem cells are extracted from the hip or elsewhere with a needle, or through a process that is carried out while awake.

This involves taking medication to increase the number of stem cells. Which type  of ‘harvesting’ is used depends on specific details of the donor’s and the recipient’s cases.Successful donors can remain anonymous.

For the time, Sue’s campaign was a phenomenal success story in terms of recruitment, adding at least 15,000 to the register over the few years of her campaign. Towards the end of the campaign a donor match was found, but Sue was already too unwell for it to be a success, and shesadly died in 1997, aged 34.

Most patients and their families won’t have the kind of tremendous strength and determination that Sue showed in the face of crushing illness. At the time, she had to persuade local newspapers and radio stations to carry her story,  but with so many needy patients, it was not feasible to expect every one to be given airtime.

This is why blogs, websites and social media represent such a revolution: they are a direct route to a wide circle of people who actually care about you and your family.

Mind you, it is quick and easy to click ‘like’ or retweet a campaign –most of us will have done so or at least be aware of such things. But it takes that bit more goodwill to take action and register to help.

It’s an issue experienced by Jonni Berger, whose mother, Sharon, received a stem cell transplant last year following a social media campaign organised by her children. Sharon was diagnosed with leukaemia just before Christmas 2012.

Jonni says: ‘Retweets raise awareness but people have to take action, and that is the hard part.

‘No one in the family was a match so my sister Caroline and I set up the #spit4mum Twitter campaign and had unprompted retweets from celebrities like Danni Minogue.

‘By January there was a 1,000 per cent rise in donor registrations. This type of campaigning really works.

‘But it took persistence and luck, and at the end of the day goodwill. Someone – we don’t know who – registered and saved her life.

‘That took a lot more than just pressing “Like” on Facebook.’

Yaser Martini, Margot’s father, explains it simply: ‘The first day I had my head in my hands. Margot was on life support, I was feeling very sorry for myself. But she had strength, and that gave us strength. We had to do something to save  our daughter.

‘The next day we started making our YouTube video. If nothing else, we knew this would be our emotional and sanity insurance policy. We can look back, whatever happens, and know we searched the hardest we could.’

He is realistic about what this means in real terms for Margot, and he knows they may not find a perfect match. ‘However many people you reach, only a small percentage will actually click through and register as a donor. We have been overwhelmed by the community aspect of this, the goodwill of people and the immense support.

‘The problem is that even if people see the campaign, only one per cent will register as a donor. We all need that figure to be much higher.’

For now, the Martinis are left to play a nervous waiting game, hoping that the next click will be the  one their baby needs.
