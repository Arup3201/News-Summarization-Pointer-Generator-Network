A grandmother accused of drowning her five-year-old grandson in a bathtub claims she was suffering from mental health problems dating from World War II.

German Marianne Bordt, 72, is said to have killed Camden Hiers by holding him under the water while he was holidaying with her in Florida.

She then allegedly tried to commit suicide, but failed and was found by her husband.

Bordt, from a village near Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, was said to have been distraught at the fact that her daughter and the boy's father had divorced.

She had travelled with her husband to Roswell, Georgia, to spend the 2009-10 New Year with their daughter and grandson, before taking him for a holiday to St George Island in Florida.

It is alleged she drowned the five-year-old while her husband was out shopping on January 5, before trying to kill herself.

Her defence is now planning to argue that she has mental problems which date back to an injury she suffered during World War II, according to a report in The Local, based on articles from Florida paper the Apalach Times.

The start of her trial was reportedly delayed last week when 
the prosecution asked for more time to prepare a rebuttal against the 
last-minute defence witness - a German-born psychoneurologist.

Manfred Grieffenstein had carried out tests on Bordt and is to argue that a head injury she suffered in a bombing raid - as well as depression and paranoia - contributed to the crime.

The raid was carried out by Russian 
forces on her hometown of Breslau on October 7, 1944.

The prosecution say they need time to find an expert in dementia and memory loss who can contradict Grieffenstein's argument, so the judge has postponed the trial until both parties were ready.

Prosecutors have called for the death penalty, while the defence are pleading insanity and think she should be detained in a Florida mental hospital for the rest of her life.

Judge Angela Dempsey has reportedly encouraged the two sides to sit down and reach a deal outside of court, because continuing the trial would mean flying in German-speaking witnesses and end up very expensive.

Bordt, from village of Nufringen, near Stuttgart, is being held at the Florida State Hospital in Chattahoochee.

She speaks no English, and has had extensive counselling to help her cope with the stress of the trial. 

Bordt travelled with her husband to Roswell, Georgia, to spend the 2009-10 New Year with their daughter and five-year-old grandson.

The grandparents then took him for a holiday to St George Island in Florida. It is alleged she drowned him in a bathtub of the holiday home while her husband was out shopping on January 5, before trying to kill herself.

She had said she could not bear that fact that her grandson was growing up in a broken family – his mother and American father were divorced.

Footage of Bordt crying and looking confused during pre-trial hearings has been posted on the websites of local newspapers.
