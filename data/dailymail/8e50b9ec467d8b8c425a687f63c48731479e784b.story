These extraordinary pictures show more than 1,700 Chinese students taking an exam in their high school's playground - because they could not all fit inside.

The freshmen students from Yichuan, Shaanxi province took the exam on Saturday in the first attempt by the school to allow pupils to sit exams in the open.

The school said the reason behind the unusual move was the lack of sufficient indoor space - and added that it could be a test of the students' organizing capacity, the People's Daily Online reported.

The paper reported that the Grade One students at Yichuan Senior High School suggested and organised the outdoor exam themselves.

The students thought of everything and in order to avoid being dazzled by the sunshine, which may have caused them to feel dizzy, a regular radio announcement ordered pupils to turn their chairs and desks collectively from time to time.

The newspaper reported that many of the students believe sitting the exam outside is a novel way to broaden their horizons and encourage them to feel more relaxed.

Some of the students also suggested it could help to prevent cheating.

'Grade One students suggested they organise the exam in such a way,' said one unnamed teacher. 'We felt it was a great idea, the weather also allowed it, so we approved the proposal.'
