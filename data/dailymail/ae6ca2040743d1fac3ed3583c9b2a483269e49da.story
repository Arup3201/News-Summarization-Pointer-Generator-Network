Died aged 91: Labour former Cabinet minister Lord Barnett was praised as an 'extraordinary individual'

Labour former Cabinet minister Lord Barnett has died aged 91, his party said today.

He was the Treasury chief secretary in the 1970s who devised the system for allocating public spending to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland that came to be known as the Barnett Formula.

The formula has remained in place, despite Lord Barnett’s arguments that it was a temporary fix and ought to be reformed as it now produces unfair results.

Labour leader in the Lords Baroness Royall said: ‘Joel was an extraordinary individual.

‘As an MP, minister and colleague in the House of Lords, to the very end he was diligently holding the Government to account and doing his best to ensure the best for the people of this country.’

Lord Barnett's daughter Erica said he died peacefully at home on Saturday morning after a short illness.

She said he retained his interest in politics during his illness and ‘the last words he spoke to me were about the European Union budget’.

The upsurge in interest in the Barnett Formula following the Scottish Referendum - and the ‘vow’ by David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg to retain the system - had provided a ‘great boost’ to him, she said.

Ms Barnett said: ‘The Barnett Formula thing during the Scottish referendum was a great boost to him, because he was able to say what he had been saying for a long time to anybody who would listen, but this time people were listening.

‘He had the chance finally to tell people just why he thought it was not only unfair but undemocratic.'

In September, Lord Barnett wrote in the Mail On Sunday that 'the Barnett Formula should be scrapped as soon as is practicable and replaced by a statutory body charged with distributing government spending in a way that the most money goes to areas that need it most'.

He added: 'After 36 years, during which I have become increasingly ashamed of having my name attached to the current system, they are quite welcome to use my name for this replacement system. I have become thoroughly disillusioned with the old one.'

Lord Barnett attended Manchester Central High School, and worked as an accountant in his early career - before first serving in politics as a councillor on Prestwich Borough Council in 1956.

In 1964 he was elected MP for Heywood and Royton, and became Treasury chief secretary in 1974. He was Public Accounts Committee chairman in 1979, and was made a life peer in 1983.

There was already a long-established convention for funding public spending in Scotland, based on the relative populations of England and Scotland almost a century before.

I merely adjusted the figures to take account of changes in the relative populations of the four home nations and drew up the spending figures accordingly – which actually resulted in a 2 per cent reduction in funding for Scotland over the settlement they would have been due under the previous, outdated population statistics.

My idea was to have the settlement ratified by the Cabinet, which it duly was. Then, I knew, the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Offices would have to take any claims for more money to Cabinet, rather than try to petition me.

I never thought the arrangement – there was and is no proper ‘formula’ that works out how much money is needed and where it should be spent – would last any longer than a year or two, certainly not after the next General Election.
