Former Vice President Al Gore is suing Al Jazeera America, saying the news network is withholding tens of millions of dollars that it owes for buying Current TV from him and other shareholders for $500 million last year.

David Boies, Gore's attorney, said in a statement that Al Jazeera America 'wants to give itself a discount on the purchase price that was agreed to nearly two years ago.'

He said the suit was filed in Delaware Court of Chancery on Friday.

Bloomberg reports the suit alleges Al Jazeera attempted to illegally seize $65 million in escrow funds that were connected to the buyout.

'Al Jazeera America wants to give itself a discount on the
purchase price that was agreed to nearly two years ago,' said Gore's lawyer, David Boies. 'We are asking
the court to order Al Jazeera America to stop wrongfully
withholding the escrow funds that belong to Currentâ€™s former
shareholders.'

Al Jazeera America didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Qatar-owned news channel took over Current TV's signal last August and hired a slew of U.S. TV news veterans like Soledad O'Brien and John Seigenthaler.

It is available in nearly 60 million U.S. homes.

Gore was set to make approximately $70 million after the network's sale

Gore and co-founder and former Current TV CEO Joel Hyatt each had 20 percent stakes in Current, while Comcast Corp. had less than a 10 percent stake.

The network, which Gore said was to be 'transformational,' at the time of its launch, failed to get big ratings.

It's estimated Gore was set to make roughly $70 million on the deal, taking into account his debt.

Another major investor in Current TV was supermarket magnate and entertainment industry investor Ron Burkle.
