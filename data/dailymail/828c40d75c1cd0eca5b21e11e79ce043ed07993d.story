A dog owner is considering taking legal action against the veterinary clinic that surgically removed her pug's cut eye without her permission. 

Kimberly Hayden took her 13-year-old pug named Chloe to the Tyrone Banfield Animal Hospital in  St Petersburg, Florida after noticing a cloudiness in the dog's left eye. 

A veterinarian diagnosed the issue as an abrasion to the eye and recommended Hayden get the eye removed for $1,400; treat it with a skin graft for $3,000 or drops. 

Hayden chose the least-painful route for Chloe and the two were sent home with three different eye drops and two oral medications.

Poor pug: Kimberly Hayden dropped her 13-year-old pug named Chloe off at the veterinary clinic recently, and when she picked her up hours later found that doctors had removed her dog's eye

However, the vet asked Hayden to bring her dog in for a follow up visit and it was later that afternoon that she first heart of the procedure that had been accidentally carried out on her beloved dog. 

'Around noon, I get a phone call and the girl on the phone says, "I just want you to know, Chloe is doing well. She's recovering well from surgery."' Hayden told Fox 13. 

'I started shaking. I think I stopped breathing for a minute,' she recalled.  'I was like, "Excuse me? What are you talking about? She's supposed to be there for a follow up."'

When Hayden dropped her dog off at the veterinarian's office that day, she even filled out paper work writing that it was simply a follow-up appointment and that she must be called for all procedures over $5 dollars.

While she was warned on the phone about her dog's condition, it was not enough to prepare Hayden for what she saw when she later picked up Chloe.

'As soon as he brought her in the room, I completely broke down. She immediately recognized my voice and came right to me. Jumped up, wanted to be in my lap and curled up into a ball,' Hayden said. 

Chloe continues to struggle getting used to life with just one eye, her owner says, adding that she is considering suing the clinic. Reportedly, the clinic at first left Hayden with the bill for the treatment but are now going to pay for the procedure. 

Hayden filled out paperwork before dropping off her dog, marking that it was only a follow-up visit 

She also wrote that she should be contacted for any procedures over $5 

They have since issued a statement on their error.  

'At Banfield Pet Hospital, we are committed to partnering with clients in all decisions regarding their pet's care. In the instance of Chloe, although the care provided was medically necessary based on the severity of her condition and lack of response to therapy, we did fail to get surgical authorization from the client on the day of the procedure,' Banfield client advocate Ari Zabell said.

 'However, we had previously discussed the need for surgery with the client — we also communicated that surgery was critical to alleviate Chloe's pain and potential for infection. We apologize for the lack of clear communication and will continue to attempt to reach Ms. Hayden in an effort to further resolve her concerns. In the meantime, we wish Chloe a speedy recovery.'  

One-eyed: Hayden says Chloe is still getting used to life with one eye, and sometimes bumps into objects around her
