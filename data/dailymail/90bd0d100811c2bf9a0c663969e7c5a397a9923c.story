Sherpa Tenzing Norgay's son has claimed that Mount Everest has become a cash-cow for the Nepalese government and the overcrowded peak is now strewn with rubbish.

Norbu Tenzing says his famous Sherpa father would be saddened that the mountain has become something of a tourist attraction, with hundreds of climbers attempting to tackle the world's highest peak.

Norbu has also urged Nepalese authorites to take action to limit the number of climbers, and to do more to protect the Sherpas in the wake of an avalanche that killed 16 of them last month.

‘If he were alive, he would be very sad to see how heavily trafficked and desecrated the mountain has become,’ he told The Sunday Telegraph.

‘It is a 
travesty, what has happened to this beautiful mountain. Everest has 
become a cash cow, where the government takes millions of dollars a 
year, but very little or nothing actually goes back.

Such is the popularity of climbing Everest that mountaineers now have to form queues to stand on the summit, and Norbu said that many leave the peak littered with rubbish.

Last month 16 Sherpas died in an avalanche as they traversed a treacherous ice fall.

Several Sherpa guides were hauling 
climbing gear between camps when a chunk of ice tore loose and triggered
 an avalanche.

Thirteen bodies were recovered and three Sherpas are 
still missing, presumed dead.

It was the worst single disaster on the mountain and speaks volumes of the demands placed upon the natives by Westerners, according to Norbu.

The families of Sherpas killed on the mountain have received just £245 compensation, a figure that has resulted in many Sherpas threatening to stop escorting climbers up Everest.

The Sherpas have argued that they deserve far more — including more insurance money, more financial aid for the families of the victims and new regulations that would ensure climbers' rights.

Earlier 
this year Nepalese tourist authorities announced a number of initiatives
 aimed at cutting congestion on the mountain, including plans to 
introduce separate fixed ropes for climbers ascending and 
descending near the summit, and posting government officials at the mountain's base camp to monitor climbers.

But Norbu has called upon the Nepalese government to go further and limit the number of mountaineers allowed to climb Everest every year, and urged climbers to consider the welfare of the Sherpas.

Last year 800 people climbed the mountain
 during the spring season, which amounts to just two or three occasions 
in May when the weather is favourable enough to enable a safe climb.

The Everest climbing season provides 
livelihoods for thousands of Nepali guides and porters, and climbers have 
long relied on Sherpas for everything from carrying gear to cooking food
 to high-altitude guiding. Without them, reaching the summit would be 
almost impossible.

Norbu described how Sherpas now must not only help guide Westerners up the 
world's highest mountain, but must also help carry the climbers' luxury 
tents, and even items such as coffee machines.

Norbu, 51, is vice-president of the American Himalayan Foundation based in San Francisco, which helps raise money for education and health-care projects for Sherpas, Nepalis and Tibetans throughout the region.

He was 
speaking on the release of Beyond the Edge 3D in cinemas this Friday, 
which documents his father’s famous climb with New Zealander Sir Edmund 
in 1953.

Since their mission, more than 4,000 climbers have reached 
the 29,035ft summit, while hundreds of people have died trying.

Norbu
 described the motivation that drove his father's team as 'pure', and 
inspired by the drive to achieve something no one else had done before, 
unlike some who make the climb today - many of whom, he says, simply 
want to get an extra line on their CVs.

Tenzing, who died in 1986 at the age of 71, and Sir Edmund were asked until the end of their days which of them had
 reached the summit first — for many years they never answered, 
insisting that they share the honour. Finally, they admitted that 
Hillary, who died in 2008, was first.

Norbu said: 
‘People of that generation climbed with the simple hope of going on an 
adventure, of doing something no one had done before. Everybody was 
working together and the sense of comradeship was unique.'
