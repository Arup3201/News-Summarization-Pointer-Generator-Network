Meet the amazing pig that thinks it's a dog.

Virginia the Juliana pig has become a massive internet sensation with more than four million people visiting her owner, Pigpimpin's Reddit site.

The 10-month-old pig lives in Colorado with her owners and a couple of boxer dogs.

Her owner, known only as Pigpimpin answers questions for the pig's legion of fans.

She said: 'I don√≠t think Virginia realises that 
she isn't a dog. We got her when she was three months old so she grew up 
around them.

'She loves to cuddle. She is obsessed with my boyfriend. As soon as he sits 
down, she jumps up onto the couch and climbs in his lap.'

Since arriving in the house in Colorado, Virginia the pig has adjusted to life alongside two dogs, copying many of their habits.

Pigpimpin said: 'Unfortunately she has eaten pork as well. I tried to throw a piece of sausage to my dog one day. He dropped it on the floor where she grabbed it and ate it. Cannibalism... Cannipigalism?'

Unlike their reputation, Virginia is very clean and does not smell, although she does suffer from dandruff

Luckily, Virginia is entirely housebroken and does not roll around in mud. She is surprisingly clean for a pig and does not smell.

'She gets a little dandruffy when her skin gets dry but that is about it.

'She's smarter than the dogs are, she learned to use their dog door before they did, and she was very easy to potty train as well.

'Because we often only think of pigs as livestock, we tend to forget that they are actually extraordinarily intelligent and loving animals. They are becoming more and more popular as pets, not just as food!'

Virginia is fully house trained and even enjoys the odd sausage if it is dropped on the floor by one of the dogs

Once fully grown, Virginia should weigh in the region of 50lbs.

Her owner added: 'She catches on a lot faster than the dogs. For example, as soon as we installed a the dog door, she walked right through it. It took the dogs a couple days of barking and pawing at it to figure they can use it to get outside.

'It took about a day for her to learn how to use the litter box. Once we put in the dog door she started going outside immediately and has never looked back. She is very neat.'
