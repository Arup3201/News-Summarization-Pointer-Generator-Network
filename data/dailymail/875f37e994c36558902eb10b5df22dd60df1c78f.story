When I was in Rotherham recently talking to victims of sex abuse, I heard a terrifying story. If it is to be believed — and after the events of this week it seems increasingly credible — it speaks volumes about how corruption and cover-up in the town reached right to the heart of the council.

I was told that a girl in her late teens was at home one evening when the door-bell rang. It was in the run-up to the local elections last year, and people were canvassing for votes.

She opened the door of her family’s house — and found herself staring into the face of a man she recognised. He had been part of a gang who had sexually abused her time and again when she was a child, between the ages of 12 and 14.

New report says Rotherham council and many of its staff remain in denial over the sex abuse scandal

He was also, as the girl discovered that night, involved in local politics.

She screamed with horror, slammed the door and ran upstairs, leaving him on the step.

‘I thought he had come to find me and that the rapes would start all over again,’ she later told her friends.

This girl, and hundreds of others like her, were not believed or listened to when they related accounts of sex abuse to authorities in the town at the centre of one of Britain’s biggest-ever child exploitation scandals.

Now, with every passing month, the stench of a cover-up grows stronger.

Files from an independent youth group which counselled the victims — because no one else in officialdom seemed to care — were taken away by Rotherham Council staff, then they mysteriously disappeared and the organisation was shut down.

In another incident, a council worker writing a report for the Home Office on how to stop grooming gangs in the area had her documents stolen from a locked office.

Even today, 17 years after the start of the shameful scandal which led to so many girls being abducted, beaten, threatened and forced to witness other rapes, a new report says that Rotherham Council and many of its employees remain in denial over the abuse.

Yet the truth, however, uncomfortable, is irrefut-able. When I took an early victim of the sex abuse gangs into Rotherham town centre one night last year, she was able within a few minutes to point out by name men who had systematically raped her as a 13-year-old schoolgirl.

They were free, on the streets, driving their flashy cars around, and — as the girl told me — almost certainly still picking up young girls to abuse.

The young woman herself is now a counsellor to abused girls. She claimed she knew some young mothers in Rotherham who have five illegitimate children apiece. They are the product of rapes by the gang members who groomed, attacked and pimped them with total impunity.

‘These children are going to school now. Everyone knows where they came from,’ she told me. ‘As for their abused mothers, they will have thought that gang rape was just a normal part of growing up here.’

I first warned in the Mail five years ago of young girls being traded in provincial towns as sex slaves. I was accused by social workers, police, councillors and even faith organisations of making it up.

In fact, I had learned the truth from parents who rang or emailed me in desperation, saying that no one was heeding their warnings. Later, I heard it from the girls themselves.

Yet when I wrote about the scandal, I was branded racist. The reason? I dared mention the truth: that most of the victims were white or of mixed race, while all too often the perpetrators were of British-Pakistani heritage.

Vindication came in a major report last year by Professor Alexis Jay, who confirmed that the greatest number of abusers were from this community.

Of course the vast, decent majority of Muslims must, surely, be as disgusted as the rest of us at the abuse. But this racial element remains an uncomfortable aspect of these obnoxious crimes, which was confirmed again yesterday.

And so we reach the crux of the problem. I believe the crimes were not tackled — and, indeed, were covered up in Rotherham — because the racial make-up of the sex gangs made the whole issue taboo for politically correct politicians, social workers and police. In modern Britain — so ultra-sensitive on matters of race — the authorities were terrified of being accused of racism if they targeted the culprits.

Time and again, the authorities which should have been protecting the girls blamed them for being out of control, wilful youngsters who consented to sex with men old enough, in some cases, to be their fathers in exchange for a ‘good time’ — alcohol, free food and a ride around in a flash car.

Lies were leaked to the media: that the girls were from dysfunctional families, had been put into care to protect them, and could not be persuaded by social workers or police to stop their wild sexual behaviour.

This was far from the reality. Virtually all of the victims of child grooming I’ve interviewed — whether it be in Rotherham, Rochdale, Oxford or Derby, all places where these predators have operated — are from caring families.

It has taken nearly two decades for the truth to emerge, but only now are we discovering the chilling extent of the abuse, and the level of cover-up.
