Seventeen months have passed since Alexander Gustafsson gave Jon Jones the fright of his life in their light-heavyweight title clash in Toronto.

In the intervening period, the champion has beaten Glover Teixeira, scrapped with Daniel Cormier in and outside the Octagon and tested positive for cocaine.

But on Saturday night, Gustafsson finally has the chance to earn the rematch he so craves.

The Swede takes on a resurgent Anthony Johnson in front of a staggering 30,000 fans in Stockholm having fought just once – a second-round stoppage win over Jimi Manuwa in London last March – since losing one of the greatest nights in UFC history.

Gustafsson knows that victory will guarantee him a second shot at Jones after injury robbed him of that opportunity last September.

Predictably, the 28-year-old has been reluctant to look beyond Johnson this week, saying simply: ‘I don't think much about Jon Jones at the moment. It's all about Anthony.’

And so it is.

Johnson’s first spell with the UFC ended in a first-round submission defeat to Vitor Belfort three years ago.

‘When I got cut after fighting Vitor Belfort, I knew I had to get my act together,’ he says.

'Me and my trainer were flying back from Brazil and we had a couple of cups of wine and started talking about what we were going to do.

‘So far we've kept our word and things have been working out.’

After years of struggling to make weight, Johnson returned at 205lb and dominated Phil Davis over three rounds before taking just 44 seconds to knock out Antonio Rogerio Nogueira last summer.

‘I didn't expect to be in this position,’ he admits. ‘I knew I would be somewhere but I didn't think I'd be where I am right now.

'Deep down inside I've always known I had the talent to be the best so being in this situation doesn't surprise me but I didn't think it would come so fast.'

Not that Johnson’s return has been completely smooth, however.

The 30-year-old was suspended last September following an accusation of domestic violence. It was later lifted following the dismissal of the civil case.

And while he too could be just 25 minutes from a title shot, Johnson is focused only on the job at hand.

‘Everyone keeps talking about Jon Jones but I don't look that far ahead,’ he says. ‘Right now, I'm just focusing on Gus.

Gustafsson has not fought since he stopped Jimi Manuwa in the second round in London last March

‘Alex Gustafsson is a tough opponent. This is a pretty even match up I think though. Something crazy is going to happen that's for sure. Don't be surprised by anything you see on the night.

‘I'm calm, cool and relaxed. I'm feeling good.

‘With the calibre of athlete that Alex is, and the calibre of athlete that I am, you can expect a huge fight.’

Gustafsson, meanwhile, believes his speed will give him the edge and that fighting at the magnificent Tele2 Arena is a ‘dream’.

‘From not fighting Jon Jones to fighting Anthony Johnson in this venue that is huge is not bad and I can't complain,’ he adds.

But whether he likes it or not, Jones will be the name on everyone’s lips come the final bell on Saturday.
