Research by neuroscientists found under 25s are the least affected by charity and almost half have never donated

Although most of us would like to think we’re selfless and kind, deep down this may not be the case. 

Neuroscientists from Mindlab put hundreds of people through subconscious tests about their views on generosity and charity. 

It discovered under 25s are the least affected by charity and around half of those studied had never donated. This was despite 82 per cent of them considering themselves altruistic.

This age group was also found to be the most sceptical about donating to charity with 67 per cent claiming they didn’t think charitable donations made any real difference. 

The most generous group were the over 55s with 63 per cent regularly donating.

As part of the study, Brighton-based Mindlab showed 200 participants from across the UK a video about a child with a life-threatening condition having a wish granted by the Make-A-Wish foundation.

All the participants then completed an Implicit Association Task (IAT). IATs are designed to determine the strength of a person’s subconscious association between themselves and a particular concept. 

In this case the participants were asked questions about their association between their subconscious and the concepts of  ‘generosity’ and ‘selfishness’.

The questions included how strongly they associate themselves with generosity and selfishness, how happy they think charity makes them feel and the importance they place on charity.

They were then asked 10 questions about their likelihood of doing various altruistic good deeds in the future.

Commenting on the findings, Dr Lewis told MailOnline: 'There are a number of reasons why [under 25s] are less likely to be 
charitable.

The study also revealed how altruistic people across the UK are. People in Northern Ireland donate to charity the most while people in the east of England are considered to be the least altruistic. A third of Londoners said they give to charity but are sceptical unless they see the end results

'They are particularly media savvy and socially conscious; aware of institutions who aren’t transparent. They’re more likely to 
respond to those whose actions follow their words, where they can see a 
difference being made and the end benefit to individuals.

'The most 
effective way to stimulate charitable engagement amongst this group is 
via social media. Under 25s are encouraged by friends who are being 
charitable. If they see their peers raising money, then they’re likely 
to get involved and donate.'

To test the results of the ITAs, the researchers also commissioned a separate UK poll. It asked 1,873 people about charity, donations and altruism.

Under 25s are the least affected by 
charity and almost half (48 per cent) of those studied said they had never donated.

This was 
despite 82 per cent of under 25s considering themselves altruistic. 

This age group was also found to be the 
most sceptical about donating to charity with 67 per cent claiming they 
didn’t think charitable donations made any real difference.

The most generous group were the over 55s with 63 per cent regularly donating.

A third of Londoners 
said they give to charity but were sceptical unless they see the end 
results.

While people in Northern Ireland 
donated to charity the most, the most generous age group were the over 55s with 63 per cent regularly donating.

The study revealed many people find it hard to be charitable without knowing where their donations are being directed. 

A third of Londoners in particular said they give to charity but are sceptical unless they see the end results; preferring to see the direct impact of their donations. 

The study also revealed how altruistic people across the UK are.

People in Northern Ireland were found to donate to charity the most, while people in the east of England were considered to be the least altruistic. 

Neuroscientist Dr David Lewis, who compiled the report with Mindlab, said: ‘The participants of our study saw a child’s wish come true and it made them kinder.

‘We called this ripple effect a Wish Wave - the participants saw the stimulus, it touched their hearts and made them more likely to commit an act of kindness.'

Dr Lewis also noted that when people focus on an individual, rather than on a group, this level of empathy increases. 

‘The research would indicate that those communities in which a child has had a wish granted could, themselves, become more charitable and generous minded in the future,’ Dr Lewis continued.

Over a third of people admitted they get an instant rush of happiness after doing a good deed, and this was most common in the northwest of England. 

Dr Lewis concluded: ‘People are far more likely to be moved, and to donate more money, to a single suffering individual than to a group of people. In the words of Mother Teresa: "If I look at the mass, I will never act. If I look at the one, I will’’

The researchers worked with Fairy and Make-A-Wish foundation to establish which groups are most likely to behave in an altruistic and charitable manner.
