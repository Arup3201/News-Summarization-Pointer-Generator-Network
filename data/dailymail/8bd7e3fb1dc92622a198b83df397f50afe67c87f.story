Lazar Markovic insists he is loving life at Liverpool but believes it will take a little more time until fans see the best of him.

The Serbian winger, 20, was brought in by Brendan Rodgers for £20million from Benfica but has had little impact so far in the Premier League.

Markovic says he feels great at Anfield though, and that the fans already like what they see.

He told Mondo: 'You know how things go in football, I'm getting there and adjusting well.

'It will take a little more time but, all in all, I feel okay.

'I feel great there and everybody has been great with me. I could not wish for more. I'm happy and that is the most important thing.

'My team-mate is the legendary Steven Gerrard, the fans love me and Anfield is great. But, as I said, I just need a little bit more time.'

Markovic is in the Serbia squad for European Championship qualifiers against Armenia and Albania.
