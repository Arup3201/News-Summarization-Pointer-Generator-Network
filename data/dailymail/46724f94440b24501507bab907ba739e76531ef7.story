The benefit cap was introduced in April by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith

More than 50 families were receiving benefits which amounted to a £70,000 a year salary, it has been revealed. 

Figures released by the Department for Work and Pensions show some families were being given the huge sum before the £26,000 benefits cap came in.

Fifty-one families had their payouts cut by at least £400 a week which means they were previously receiving at least £900 a week - the equivalent of £46,800 or £68,000 a year before tax. 

Their benefits have now been capped at £500 - or £26,000 a year - which was introduced in April by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith. 

He told The Sunday Telegraph: 'The benefit cap has successfully addressed the ludicrous situation we were in where people were recieving far more in benefits than the ordinary hardworking family earns. 

'It is not right that some families were raking in almost double the amount that the average taxpayer takes home.'

Figures show that by October 2008, 28,000 families have had their benefits cut which include 9,000 with more than five children.

About 300 families had their benefits reduced by between £300 and £400. 

The new scheme is expected to save about £6million a year. 

Statistics show 98 per cent of families affected by the benefits cap have at least one child. 7,730 families, 40 per cent, have at least five children.

Department for Work and Pensions said the 'curtain had finally fallen' on the culture of welfare dependency.

The radical reforms have led to 36,000 people trying to find work rather than live on benefits, ministers claim.

The annual national welfare bill was £208billion and Iain Duncan Smith brought in the cap to reduce the burden on the state.

A single mother with eight children who receives £2,000 a month in state handouts has complained she is struggling to make ends meet.

Marie Buchan, 31, whose children range in age from 12 to two months, lives in a three-bedroom housing association house in Selly Oak, Birmingham, but says it's not big enough and has applied for a bigger one.

And she says her benefits payments, which were reduced from £582 a week to £500 a week in September after the government introduced a cap on handouts, are not enough for her family to survive on.

Now Miss Buchan, who is £2,000 in arrears with her rent, says she fears she may be evicted after falling behind with her rent.

Miss Buchan, a tenant of Bourneville Village Trust in the south-west of Birmingham, used to receive £385 a week in child tax credit, £100 child benefit and £97 income support.

But the benefits cap, introduced earlier this year by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to reduce the burden on the state, limited her handouts to £500 a week.

Mother-of-eleven Heather Frost faced having her £60,000-a-year benefits cut after receiving £2,000 to appear on TV and boast about her life.

The 37-year-old, who never worked and claimed around £60,000 a year in benefits, appeared in a documentary series on Channel 5 called On Benefits and Proud.

In October, her local council said it would now be investigating her huge hand-outs after reports she was given a substantial fee to appear on the show.

Frost, who was receiving £900-per-week in benefits, featured on the documentary which looks at a number of families from across the country who are supported by the state.

Earlier this year Sharon Minkin admitted she was caught in a 'benefits package trap' equal to a salary of £70,000 a year.

Pictured with her two dogs, Ms Minkin said that she did not want to go to work because it means her children would have to do what thousands of others do when they go to university and take out a student loan

The divorcee said she could not afford to work - because it would leave her worse off.

The 49-year-old and her three children live in a spacious semi-detached three bedroom home in Hertfordshire.

Her life was funded by the taxpayer but she blamed the government for creating a benefits 'trap' that means she wil would never earn so much money as she gets in handouts.
