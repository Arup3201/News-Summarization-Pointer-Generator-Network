The mother of a teenager travelling on a false passport on missing flight MH370 has spoken for the first time of her son's innocence in the fate of the aircraft.

Niloufar Vaezi Tehrani said her son Pouria Nourmohammadi was 'just an ordinary kid' fleeing from his native Iran because of religious persecution.

Speaking from Germany, Ms Vaezi said she had been waiting for her son to land in Frankfurt three months ago - but he never arrived because the flight he had taken off from in Kuala Lumpur vanished after a little over an hour.

'Just an ordinary kid': Pouria's mother said he was fleeing Iran because of religious persecution

She admitted she knew he was travelling on a passport that was not his but said he was 'desperate' to leave Iran because people had found out he was Christian, not Muslim, and he had started to get into major problems.

'He was planning to go to Germany to be a good person, to study, work and eat,' she told Sydney's Daily Telegraph through an interpreter.

'He was just looking for happiness. He was looking to be able to speak his opinion and he was looking for freedom - he just wanted to be able to live without fear and being anxious.'

She said Pouria had also been planning to marry his girlfriend, who remains in Iran and who is very stressed because he is now missing.

Ms Vaezi said she last spoke to Pouria on March 7, some 10 minutes before he headed to Kuala Lumpur International Airport to catch the flight which would take him on the first leg of his journey to Frankfurt.

'We thought initially that the passport was just a made-up passport. We didn't even know that the passport was stolen from somebody else,' said Ms Vaezi.

It has already been reported that the passport Pouria was using had been stolen from a tourist in Thailand.

His mother said the family were anxious about his use of the passport.

'We talked a lot about this and I said they may realise the age difference between Pouria and the person on the passport.

'We were basically very nervous. However, despite his fear, Pouiria was very excited and very happy that he was coming to see me.'

But it was on the morning of March 9 that his mother received a call from her brother who told her a Malaysian Airlines flight was missing.

Now she says that until the plane is found she won't give up hope that she will see her son again and she even baked a cake for his 19th birthday on April 30 in case he was found alive.

Malaysian Airlines, she said, has not contacted her or passed any information to her.

She said she does not want the search to be abandoned.

'It is the pain of 239 families. I don't want the aeroplane forgot because of politics or lies or anything,' she said.

Her comments come as other families reveal their pain at news the missing Malaysia Airlines aircraft is not in the Indian Ocean search zone based on pings detected in early April.

A complete blow is how the New Zealand wife of a passenger on board the missing plane described the update.

Danica Week's mechanical engineer husband Paul was on board the ill-fated flight, bound for Mongolia where he was set to start a new job.

Mrs Weeks said the she was trying to comes to terms with the devastating news that MH370 is not located in the search area of the West Australian Coast, but she is still holding hope.

The Australian Transport Safety Bureau has confirmed Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 is not in the southern Indian Ocean search zone where pings were detected in early April

'I don't know where to go from here,' she told Fairfax radio on Friday.

'I'm just a wife trying to find her husband ... 77 days on, I still don't know where he is.'

On Thursday, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said that the search in the zone where acoustic pings were detected was finished completed and the area could be ruled out as the resting place of MH370.

Based on authorities confidence that the pings were the best lead in the search for the missing plane, Ms Weeks said she felt like she had been given false.

Anticipating the discovery of the wreckage, Mrs Weeks was organising a memorial for her husband as the search was taking place.

'To completely disregard it entirely was just like ripping my heart out,' the mother-of-two said.

The Weeks have two sons together, Lincoln, 3, and 13-month-old Jack, and since the disappearance of the flight, Ms Weeks has been told by people to tell the young boys the truth.

'I'm telling Lincoln the truth that dad isn't coming back and it wasn't his choice,' she said. 'He's obviously emotional about that.'

But without being able to process with the truth herself, Mrs Weeks said it was difficult trying to her her children.

'I still have the slight piece of hope,' she said. 'I know logically it sounds ridiculous, but how can you not when you have nothing to go on?'

As she is still coming to terms with the loss of her husband, who was also her best friend, Mrs Weeks said she has not been able to think about taking legal action against Malaysia Airlines.

The Joint Agency Coordination Centre has now expanded the search for MH370 to a much wider zone using an arc defined by British company Inmarsat based on the final handshakes between the Boeing 777 and satellites.

A new, potentially deeper underwater search will begin in August and could take up to a year.

MH370 went missing on March 8 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board.

The search for the missing plane will move to a wider zone and will start from August

Australian Transportation Safety Board chief commissioner Martin Dolan said he was confident that search teams were targeting the right area.

'We still don't have anything that confirms that it's the wrong place, but we will do our analysis and we will determine the best search area for the next phase,' he told AFP.

Mr Dolan said it was likely that the linear arc represented the plane's flight path.

'The thing that we're absolutely confident of is somewhere on that long arc we will find the aircraft,' he said.

'But, because it's so long, we have to be able to find a much smaller segment of the arc to concentrate our search and that's what our analysis is looking at defining.'

Mr Dolan said authorities were re-analysing satellite data and aircraft performance information to define an area of up to 60,000 square kilometres to search further.
