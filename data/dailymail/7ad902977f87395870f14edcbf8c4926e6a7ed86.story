The controversial new NHS ‘111’ helpline will launch tomorrow with thousands of inexperienced staff who have carried out only half the required training, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

Doctors fear lives will be put at risk after in-house recruitment chiefs admitted the service is ‘woefully underprepared.’

NHS managers blame the government for demanding up to a third more recruits just weeks before it is meant to launch.

Staff were supposed to receive two weeks training, work for a month, and then undertake a further two weeks training.

But due to the last minute influx of new call handlers, recruits have not been given the second half of their training. An NHS recruitment manager responsible for two major trusts said: ‘The whole project has been rushed. It’s a shambles and lives are going to be put at risk.

‘Staff are paid £16,000 a year, have no medical background and are expected to help distressed, unwell people on the phone. They are woefully unprepared.Up and down the country it is the same.’

Dr Kailash Chand, deputy chair of the British Medical Association, said: ‘I fully believe the new system will suffer these problems because the government is cutting costs.

‘According to the NHS service specification the cost per call for NHS 111 should be £8, almost a third of what NHS Direct costs.

‘The launch needs delaying until it is safe for the public.’

The use of NHS 111 for non-urgent calls is a flagship Coalition health policy.

The system is intended to lower the health budget by replacing the £123 million-a-year NHS Direct.

Staff ask the caller a series of questions and enter the answers  into the NHS Pathways program. The software judges whether the patient needs emergency help.

An NHS spokesperson said: ‘NHS England is working with local commissioners and giving them more time to rectify this issue. NHS England has paid for NHS Direct to keep taking calls where there are capacity issues.’
