Popular international air routes connecting Europe, North America and Asia are at risk after airplanes were warned to avoid airspace near an erupting Alaska volcano as it spews ash 30,000 feet above sea level.

Winds have blowing ash from Pavlof Volcano to the west and southwest, warned the National Weather Service on Saturday.

Pavlof began erupting on Wednesday, pushing lava out from a vent near its summit and by Friday the ash cloud had reached 16,000 feet.

Warning: Pavlof began erupting, pushing lava out from a vent near its summit, on Wednesday. On Friday, the ash cloud reached 16,000 feet

Rising: The eruption intensified at 6 a.m. on Saturday, sending the ash cloud higher

The eruption intensified on Saturday morning, sending the ash cloud higher, said Dave Schneider, a geophysicist at Alaska Volcano Observatory.

It's not clear how long this eruption will last, Schneider said. Pavlof's eruptions may last for weeks or months with varying levels of intensity, he said.

Pavlof is Alaska's most active volcano and is located about 625 miles southwest of Anchorage. It's had more than 40 recorded eruptions, including earlier this year and last year.

It also lies along popular international air routes connecting Europe, North America and Asia.

On the map: The volcano is located in an uninhabited region nearly 600 miles (966 km) southwest of Anchorage

Spewing: Pavlof (pictured this week) is Alaska's most active volcano and is located about 625 miles southwest of Anchorage. It's had more than 40 recorded eruptions, including earlier this year and last year

The eruption has had little effect on people on the ground. The closest community, Cold Bay, is 40 miles away. 

Observers there reported seeing dark snow on the surface of the volcano on Wednesday, indicating an eruption had started.

There have been some small avalanches of hot rock down the north flank of the volcano. These may produce local mud flows to the north, but scientists say they would likely be minor.

Growing: A pink arrow on this map shows the brown ash plume extending 125 miles (200km) northwest 

In 2013 Pavlof released ash plumes as high as 22,000ft, according to the Alaska Volcano Observatory
