This is the moment a drunk heroin addict lurched down a city street clutching £5,000 of wedding dresses he had stolen during a late night burglary at a bridal boutique.

John Howlett, 36, remembered nothing about his drink and drug-fuelled evening and woke up the next morning with a hangover and surrounded by a pile of white gowns, a court heard.

Police were forced to show him the CCTV of the break-in at a Swansea shop and then him stumbling around in the street, struggling under the weight of the stolen gowns.

Thief in the night: This CCTV shows John Howlett carrying £5,000 of bridal gowns he stole from Victoria Bridal shop in Swansea, which he then took home and passed out on

On the run: Howlett, who had been drinking and taking drugs, claimed that he had no memory of the crime, forcing police to show him the CCTV

Howlett managed to stagger a mile-and-a-half-home and make it up to bed before passing out on top of the dresses.

In the dock: John Howlett admitted he was surprised when he woke and found himself surrounded by wedding gowns

Probation officer Nicola Thomas told the court: 'He had been drinking and woke up surrounded by wedding dresses.

'He says he cannot remember anything about the burglary.'

Howlett panicked and stuffed the dresses into a cupboard under the stairs at his home in Swansea, South Wales.

A court heard how they were still there when police tracked him down from the CCTV film - and arrested him.

Bemused Howlett admitted taking the dresses after being shown footage of his drunken spree.

Magistrates heard Howlett had broken into Victoria's Bridal in the centre of Swansea after midnight and was caught on the shop's CCTV.

Miss Jones said: 'One of the dresses belonged to a bride whose wedding was just days away.

'She had been forced to get another gown at short notice.'

The father-of-one appeared at the city's magistrates court where he admitted burglary following the raid in November last year.

Howlett, from Townhill, Swansea, also pleaded guilty to separate count of fraud after writing blank cheques totalling £1,320 to pay gambling debts.

Sentencing was adjourned by Swansea magistrates until later this month for reports.

Howlett was granted bail and given a night time curfew told to stay away from shops in Swansea city centre.
