One of the most important tools  an actor has is their face. 

From expressing grief and torture to joy and love the face is one of the most powerful ways to convey emotions.

But in a video shot by Pedestrian TV, Australian actor Guy Pearce was asked to use his expressions a little differently, by recreating popular emoticons known as Emoji.

In a new video released by Pedestrian TV Australian actor Guy Pearce recreated Emoji emoticons

The Hollywood actor nailed many of the hilarious expressions such as this sunglasses shot

While Pearce - who started his career in soap Neighbours - hits the nail on the head with some of the impressions, other attempts fall a little short. 

In a game called Emoji Me the 47-year-old was shown  the team's favourite symbols one-by-one which he then attempted to reenact.

The first challenge is relatively simple, and as the Emoji 'face screaming in fear' pops up on the screen Pearce imitates the image perfectly.

Others Pearce struggled with, like this smirking Emoji

The wink was one of the actor's best attempts at recreating the expressive emoticons

Next on the list is a classic winking face, which the Australian actor also recreates with ease.

However Pearce struggled with the smirking emoticon, contorting his face before saying 'Oh it's actually going up isn't it ... I'm not sure what that one is.'

The acclaimed actor then manages to pull an exceptional surprised face, before presenting arguably the most impressive of the lot.

At the end of the video Pearce quips 'Do i get the job?'

Closing one eye and sticking his tongue out in the style of Miley Cyrus, Pearce mimics the animated emoticon in spectacular fashion.

The information desk Emoji, sunglasses emoticon, kissing face and a big grin are all added to his repertoire by the end of the video, where Pearce quips 'Do i get the job?'.

Late last year the actor released the video for his his new single Fly All The Way, which featured Annie Jones, Pearce's Neighbours character Mike Young's on-screen love interest.
