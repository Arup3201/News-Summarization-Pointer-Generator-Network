A court in China has sentenced three people to death for planning an attack at Beijing's iconic Tiananmen Gate which left five people dead and 40 injured.

The three were accused of providing funds for the attack, which was blamed on Muslim separatists, on October 28, in which a car ploughed through tourists before crashing and bursting into flames, killing two bystanders and the three attackers.

A court in the Xinjiang regional capital 
of Urumqi sentenced the three to death, the official Xinhua News Agency 
said. Five other people were given prison sentences, with four receiving
 terms of five to 20 years and one getting a life sentence.

Xinhua said they had travelled to Beijing on October 7, 2013, to deliver money to buy a jeep, gasoline, knives and other materials related to the attack.

The eight were arrested within days of the incident. A Chinese visitor and a tourist from the Philippines were killed in the attack, along with the vehicle's driver, his wife and mother-in-law, according to Chinese authorities.

The attack was the first to strike Beijing in recent years. It pointed to a new level of violence and lethal intent in the long-simmering insurgency against Chinese rule in the far northwestern region of Xinjiang waged by radicals among the native Turkic Uighur Muslim population.

The Tiananmen Gate attack was followed by similar incidents in Xinjiang, including one on May 22 in which men driving off-road vehicles and throwing explosives ploughed through a crowded market in Urumqi, killing 39 people.

Police said four suspects were killed at the scene and a fifth was caught that evening in an area about 250 kilometers (150 miles) south of Urumqi.

Beijing says unrest among Uighurs is caused by extremist groups with ties to Islamic terror groups abroad, but has shown little direct evidence.

Uighur activists say public resentment against Beijing is fueled by an influx of settlers from China's Han ethnic majority, economic disenfranchisement and onerous restrictions on Uighur religious and cultural practices.

Death sentences in China are automatically forwarded to the Supreme People's Court for appeal but are rarely overturned. While official figures are not released, China is believed to execute more prisoners than the rest of the world combined.
