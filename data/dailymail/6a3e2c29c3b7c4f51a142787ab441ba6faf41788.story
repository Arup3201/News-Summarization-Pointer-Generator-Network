A Minnesota toddler who has been on dialysis since she was an infant is about to receive the gift of a new kidney thanks to a complete stranger 1,500 miles away.

Two-year-old Arianna Moore of Pine City was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder when she was born, and has since had to spend 10 hours of every day hooked up to a dialysis machine.

But that may soon change thanks to the generosity of 37-year-old Jacksonville, Florida mother Christy Harding, who was touched to donate her own kidney after reading a Facebook post about Arianna.

What a gift: Arianna Moore of Pine City, Minnesota will soon be getting a new kidney thanks to a stranger organ donor who read about the 2-year-old on Facebook

Helping out: 37-year-old Jacksonville, Florida mother Christy Harding read about little Arianna's plight and decided to see if she was eligible to donate her own kidney to the toddler

Arianna seemed a healthy baby when she was born two years ago along with her twin sister, Nevaeh. But just seven weeks later, the infant's kidneys failed taking her family by surprise.

'When I had her and they said, "Her kidneys don't work," I was like, "What do you mean? She's a baby." She was completely healthy at birth,' mother Ashley Booth, 27, told KMSP.

Since then, the little girl has spent most of her day on dialysis and the effects of the disorder had left her 10 pounds lighter, and 4 inches shorter, than her sister.

Booth became desperate to find her daughter a donor, and while she wasn't optimistic about posting on Facebook - she figured she'd try her luck anyway.

'I had no faith that we'd find a kidney donor on Facebook but I sure as heck was going to try,' she told Good Morning America.

But the post surprisingly turned out to be fruitful when Harding read it on her wall.

'One of my friends shared one of Arianna's pictures and it showed up on my timeline,' Harding said. 'For some reason, I stopped and started thinking about it, and I just knew I had to make a phone call.'

Harding then contacted Arianna's hospital in Minneapolis to see if she was eligible, and after a few tests she figured out she was a perfect match. She says she was inspired to donate because she has a 2-year-old daughter herself, and would hope someone would perform the same act of kindness for her girl.

Try anything: Arianna's mother Ashley Booth (pictured together on the left) says she wasn't optimistic posting on Facebook would find her daughter a donor, but it proved successful in the end

'Christy emailed me to let me know she was the one donating. I was in tears reading her email to me,' Booth said. 'It was pretty crazy. All I can do is cry every time I think about it.'

Now the 2-year-old and her stranger guardian angel are set to undergo surgery on May 7 in Minneapolis.

And that's not the only gift Harding is giving the Arianna.

She has since set up a Go Fund Me page to raise money to send Arianna and her family to Disney World in Florida - a favorite vacation spot for the Harding family, who have season tickets.

'It's so amazing. We haven't even met her yet. I cannot wait for next Monday. I don't know if I'll be able to let go of her once I hug her,' Booth said.Â
