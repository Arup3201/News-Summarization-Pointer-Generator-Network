At the beginning of 2013, Celeste and Sydney Corcoran were a typical close mother and daughter, but as the year ends they have drawn even closer together as they both recovered from seriously injuries sustained in the Boston bombings.On April 15, two pressure-cooker bombs went off near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, where Celeste, 48, and Sydney, 18, were cheering on Celeste's sister Carmen Accabo.Shrapnel tore through Sydney's thigh, severing a major artery and leaving her close to bleeding to death on the footpath. Her mother's injuries would leave her a double amputee.

The devastating emotional and physical repercussions of that day have shaped 2013 for the Corcoran family, as they will for the rest of their lives.

But their spirit is the epitome of the Boston Strong slogan, and Celeste and Sydney fought a thousand tiny battles after their horrific ordeal, and won.

'She's not just my mom, she's one of my best friends. We've always been really, really close but especially after such a horrific event, we just got so much closer,' Sydney told the Boston Globe.

'She's my mother so she's always taken care of me - I like to think I've always taken care of her too - but now even more so. I ahve to help ehr through the rest of her life.'Photographer John Tlumacki from the Boston Globe was there on the day the bombs set by Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan went off in downtown Boston.

He captured photographs of the chaotic aftermath, the victims and the bloodied pavements.

Photographs of husband Kevin Corcoran leaning over his wounded wife and pictures of Sydney, lying on the pavement as strangers saved her life by pressing tourniquets into her leg were seen by millions around the world.He has been following the progress of Celeste and Sydney Corcoran since he photographed the mother and daugher on the worst day of their lives. He met with Celeste, a stylist at The Emerge Salon on Newberry St, just a street away from where the bombs went off, and Sydney, who was a high school student, to apologize for the way he'd had to photograph them on that day, and they agreed to let him document their recovery. Sydney Corcoran didn't know she was just meters from her parents when the bombs went off. Her parents believed she was elsewhere, watching the race with friends.When the bombs went off, Sydney was just feet away from her parents, lying on the pavement bleeding as strangers tried to stanch the flow of blood from her leg with t-shirts.

Celeste was lying closeby, both legs mangled from the explosions and her husband Kevin Corcoran desperately trying to help his wife.

'I'm so glad that I was standing to the right of her. I'm so glad it was me,' said Celeste Corcoran. 'That in some way, my body shielded her.'

While Celeste was in surgery having both her legs amputated after the explosion, a doctor realized that Sydney Corcoran, who had sustained  injuries to her right foot, left ankle, right thigh and back, was her daughter.

'If Sydney would have died, I don't think I would have... I think I would have died with her,' Celeste Corcoran told the Boston Globe.

They wound up in the same recovery room and were later placed side-by-side in hospital beds.

Three weeks later Sydney Corcoran was cleared to go home, her legs crisscrossed with foot-long veins.

Her mother faced grueling, months-long rehabilitation and had to learn to walk again on prosthetic legs.

'I wanted to see her walk,' said Sydney. 'It was so hard to watch her just sit in her chair, day after day, and just cry.'

'They just feel so unnatural,' she told the Boston Globe. 'It feels like you’re walking on stilts.'

Since the bombings, the Corcorans have been showered in gifts, love and support.

The Celeste and Sydney Corcoran Facebook page depicts the two meeting sports stars and singers, television presenters and movie stars.

Sydney was crowned the prom queen of her Lowell high school and Celeste was given a standing ovation by the crowd at a Michael Buble concert.

But between public smiles and milestones were the private setbacks that didn't appear on Facebook or in the newspapers.

Sydney had to undergo several emergency operations on her legs, and began injecting herself in the stomach every day with blood thinners.

Celeste traveled to Florida in October to be fitted for new, high tech legs and received a call from her son, Tyler.

Sydney was seething. According to the Boston Globe, she tweeted at the woman, 'You should be ashamed. My mother lost both her legs and I almost died in the Marathon. You need a filter.'

Among messages of support were taunts from internet trolls.

Hundreds of miles away in Florida, Celeste felt helpless to comfort her daughter.

Both mother and daughter have difficulty when apart from each other or Kevin and Tyler Corcoran, terrified that something will happen.

Kevin Corcoran suffers painful flashbacks to the day his wife lost his legs, and Tyler is guilt-ridden he wasn't there that day to protect his sister.

Celeste says the only thing that keeps her going on days she refers to as 'amputee days' is her daughter's strength.

'When I see her strength, and her pushing through things, I feel like I have to do the same thing,' Celeste told the Boston Globe. 'I feel like we definitely help each other.'

As 2013 comes to a close, the family is through the worst of the health crises and rehabilitation process.

Celeste is growing steadier on her feet every day, and the family is building a new, one-storey home in Dracut with money they received from the Marathon survivors' One Fund. Celeste will be able to use her wheelchair with ease in the home.

Healing together: Celeste and Sydney Corcoran have had a traumatic 2013 but made it through together

On December 18, Celeste passed her driving test so that she can get a car with hand gears.

Up until now, she has been dependent on her son and husband to get around.

She has begun working selected hours back at her beloved Emerge Salon where she has been sorely missed by colleagues and clients.

'When I do something like that by myself, when I do something that I thought I wouldn't be able to do, like climb up that step by myself, climb up that rock wall, what I really want to say is, f*** you terrorists,' Celeste told the Boston Globe. 'Every achievement feels like I'm getting justice.'

Sydney has begun classes at Merrimack College in North Andover.

'I can’t just stay in the house with my thoughts because they will eat me alive,' she said. 'I have to go out, and live.'
