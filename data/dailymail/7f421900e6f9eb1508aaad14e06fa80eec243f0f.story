Cardiff manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wants to rescue Ravel Morrison from his West Ham hell.

The Bluebirds have opened talks with the Hammers over a move for the controversial England Under-21 star.

It is understood the Championship side have made an informal offer for Morrison.

The forward has been at the centre of controversy over the past week. He was remanded in custody over an alleged assault on his ex-girlfriend and her mother in Manchester last week.

Court: Any deal could be scuppered by the West Ham midfielder's ongoing court case

And Cardiff's interest could yet be scuppered over his ongoing court case.

Nevertheless, Solskjaer still remains keen on taking the talented forward next season.

Morrison's future at Upton Park is unclear, with manager Sam Allardyce and the board appearing to be at odds over the forward.

Allardyce has publicly stated that Morrison is unlikely to feature in his plans next season, while co-owner David Sullivan insists the former Manchester United man remains central to the Hammers.

However, it is understood the Hammers will give serious consideration to a formal offer from Cardiff.

Solskjaer believes he is the man who can finally coax the best out of Morrison.

The pair worked together during Solksjaer term as United's reserve team manager, so the Cardiff boss knows first hand Morrison's huge potential.
