The biggest event in the women’s game was some place to make your professional debut but Stephanie Meadow coped so well at the US Open last month she finished third behind Michelle Wie and world No 1 Stacy Lewis to earn a six-figure cheque.

Now the 22-year-old from Royal Portrush gets to play her second tournament, starting at the Buckinghamshire on Thursday, alongside England’s equally precocious talent Charley Hull at the start of what might prove quite a professional rivalry.

The pair are among the star attractions at the ISPS Handa European Masters, the first of two events in England — the other is the Ricoh British Open at Royal Birkdale next week — that provide an ideal showcase for some of the exciting young talents in the European game.

Hull and Meadow were in the same victorious Curtis Cup team in 2012, where the latter secured the winning point. ‘It’s great to see what Charley’s been doing and hopefully we can put on a bit of a show,’ said Meadow.

‘Just to be a pro is really exciting at the moment and I take a lot of confidence from what I did at the US Open. But equally, you have  to ground yourself again and remember to do all your drills.  The reaction to Pinehurst has been great but it’s time to concentrate on a new tournament.’

Meanwhile, at the French Open, Meadow’s fellow Portrush native Graeme McDowell is targeting a successful defence of his title to boost his Ryder Cup standing. McDowell is 16th in the table with only the top nine qualifying automatically, but knows a lot of points are on offer at Le Golf National in Versailles, where the Ryder Cup will be staged in 2018. He said: ‘Hopefully, with a big effort this summer, I can get on  to the team for Gleneagles.’

One to watch: Meadow willl be a star attraction at the ISPS Handa European Masters in England
