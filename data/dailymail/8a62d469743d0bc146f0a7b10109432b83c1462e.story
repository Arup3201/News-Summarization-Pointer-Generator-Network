Convicted: Lucy Worthington, pictured above at court, sent 'sinister' messages to PC Christopher Stoddart and his wife

A disgraced detective convicted of harassing her ex-lover - who worked for the same force as her - has been sacked.

Lucy Worthington, 28, sent a string of text messages, letters and voicemails to a fellow officer and his wife after the end of a six-month affair.

She was dismissed for gross misconduct this week after a court found her guilty of two counts of harassment.

At a later hearing she was fined £500 and for gross misconduct this week as she was told she had tarnished her 'impeccable' record.

Worthington had been working as a detective constable at Wilmslow CID when she met PC Christopher Stoddart, who was married.

Manchester Magistrates' Court heard how the pair began a sexual relationship in January 2012, which, ended when Worthington became pregnant.

She then started sending PC Stoddart a text messages threatening to tell his wife Christine about the affair.

After having the baby at the end of 2012, she later told PC Stoddart, 47, he was the father - a claim which was later disproved.

She then turned her attentions to his wife and used a pay-as-you-go phone and anonymous online accounts to disguise where her 'sinister' messages were coming from.

Describing the impact of the harassment on Mrs Stoddart, prosecutor Ruth Mann said: 'This had a devastating effect on her.'

Worthington, Sandbach, Cheshire, was convicted of harassment earlier this month, and received her sentence this week.

As well as the fine, she was made subject to a restraining order, which stipulates that she cannot contact either Mr or Mrs Stoddart, nor go near their home.

Affair: Worthington, who was a detective, fell pregnant during her relationship with PC Stoddart - and falsely claimed he was the father of her child

Guilty: Worthington was convicted of two counts of harassment at Manchester Magistrates' Court

District Judge Mark Hadfield told her: 'This should not be taken as an indication that these offences are not serious - they are.

'Your behaviour involved various types of communication.

'You have lost your career, which you started shortly after leaving school and had had some success at.'

Tim Ashmole, defending, said she had previously had an 'impeccable' record during her ten years with the police.

After the hearing, a Cheshire Police spokeswoman said: 'Following an internal disciplinary hearing, Lucy Worthington has been dismissed without notice for gross misconduct.'
