Stefan Johansen has told wonderkid Martin Odegaard that joining Celtic would be an ideal next step in his remarkable rise to prominence.

Ronny Deila revealed last week that he has not given up hope of luring his former prodigy from Stromsgodset – despite the 15-year-old Norwegian midfielder being the most wanted youngster in Europe.

Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich are among those tracking Odegaard, who has also been linked with Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool.

Martin Odegaard is Norway's youngest ever player and has been scouted by Europe's biggest clubs

Odegaard, 15, has broken into the first team at his club Stromsgodset and is wanted by several top teams

Johansen, though, sees real merits in the teenager not jumping straight to one of the continent’s elite clubs but instead continuing his development under a manager he trusts.

It is a point he has made to his ex-Stromsgodset team-mate, who is now also a colleague in Norway’s national squad.

‘I’ve talked a lot with Martin,’ said fellow midfielder Johansen, ahead of tonight’s closing Europa League group game against Dinamo Zagreb in Croatia. ‘We keep in touch and speak on the phone.

‘I have told him that Celtic can be a good choice for him. The way we play would suit him. We have the ball a lot and that’s what Martin likes. He wants to be on the ball and creating chances.

The Norwegian international has trained with Liverpool, Real Madrid and Manchester United recently

Odegaard is an attacking midfielder with an eye for goal, who Stefan Johansen called an 'amazing talent'

‘Martin is an amazing talent and I hope he comes to Celtic. The gaffer has shown in Norway that he is very good with young players and he gives them a chance when they deserve it. Martin knows him and myself.

‘But it is up to Martin. His father is a good guy who helps him a lot and he’s also very mature in the way he thinks. I’m sure he’ll make the right decision for his career.’

He added: ‘To say that you are going to go and play at Real Madrid and compete against Ronaldo and Bale and those guys… for a 15-year-old that’s going to be difficult.

‘He would be unlikely to play right away at a Real Madrid or Barcelona. Of course it would be difficult. But, as I said, he needs to choose for himself.’

The Celtic midfielder says his compatriot would fit in at the club, and might struggle to play elsewhere

Johansen admits he has been hugely impressed by the way Odegaard has coped with the incredible hype that surrounds him.

‘He’s been at all the big clubs in Europe and it’s probably the most insane thing I’ve seen around a 15-year-old boy,’ he said.

‘Everybody in Norway is talking about him. It’s crazy. But he has handled it all.

‘He is very good, that’s for sure. He’s about to turn 16 but you can give him the ball and know he won’t lose it. He’s creative, too.

‘He’s young and will get stronger. Give him one or two years and he will get there on the physical side. But on the ball, he is fantastic.’
