Prolific film and music pirate Keith Tamkin, 52, of Felpham, Sussex, was jailed for 18 months after admitting infringing copyright and other charges

A film and music pirate who ran a vast illegal downloading operation has been jailed after police found his stash of thousands of knock-off films and albums.

Cyber-criminal Keith Tamkin, 52, downloaded an estimated 150,000 movies and songs onto more than 100 computers before copying them onto CDs and DVDs and selling them to a network of clients, Chichester Crown Court heard.

Tamkin, of Felpham, Sussex, was sent to prison yesterday after admitting infringing copyright, money laundering, transferring criminal property and possessing prohibited weapons.

He was caught when police and anti-piracy investigators from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) raided two addresses in November 2011.

They discovered more than 100 computer hard drives, filled with an estimated 150,000 CDs and films, and eight computers set up to burn as many DVDs at once as possible.

His hoard, found at his home in Felpham and a flat in Bognor Regis, was so vast it took police more than a year to sort through it, the court was told.

Tamkin pleaded guilty to one count of distributing articles infringing copyright, two of money laundering involving £140,000, and one of transferring criminal property.

He also admitted possessing prohibited weapons - a pepper spray and a stun gun - and was jailed for 18 months.

Speaking after the hearing David Wood, of the BPI said: 'This case was significant in that it was the largest domestic factory uncovered to date in the UK.

'It had the capability of manufacturing and distributing counterfeit product on a truly commercial scale.'

Detective Inspector Chris Neilson of the Sussex Police Economic Crime Unit said: 'Detectives and Financial Investigators from our Unit worked closely with the BPI and were able to establish Tamkin’s full role in this case.

'Intellectual Property (IP) crime and associated offences of money laundering will be pursued by Sussex Police in a co-ordinated way with partners involved in tackling IP Crime, including the Intellectual Property Office, in order to disrupt this type of criminality.'We will now be seeking a court confiscation order against Tamkin under the Proceeds of Crime Act to take back for society his criminal profits.'

Video and music piracy, or illegally downloading films and music, is a significant problem in Britain, where an estimated 7million people visit sites that offer content illegally each month.

Pirates can use peer-to-peer (P2P) networks in which individuals share files with each other, or cyberlockers, where individuals can upload songs or films for another to download.

Online music thieves can use stream-ripping applications, which record music played digitally over the internet, while both music and films can be recorded via unlicensed streaming services.

Usually the people involved in generating these illegal sources of content charge for the service.

Authorities have noticed a relative reduction in the number of people accessing this illegal content recently, largely thanks to some of the most popular sites being shut down or restricted.

Megaupload, which had more users than any other locker site in the UK, with around 1.3million visitors a month,  was shut down last year.

Filesonic restricted its service and then shut down in the wake of Megaupload being closed, while another site called RapidShare restricted its service in a move to avoid illegal downloads.
