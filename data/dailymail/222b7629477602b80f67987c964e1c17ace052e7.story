The New Mexico Corrections Secretary has taken the undercover boss concept to the extreme, spending 48 hours in solitary confinement in a Santa Fe prison.

Prisoner 106, according to prison records, is a dangerous armed robber - but in actual fact, he's Gregg Marcantel, the head of corrections for the state of New Mexico.

Dressed in a prison jumpsuit, Marcantel was indistinguishable from the other prisoners housed in the 12-foot-by-seven-foot concrete cells of Level Six at the New Mexico State Penitentiary.

Inmate number 106: Gregg Marcantel in his prison jumpsuit, set to enter solitary confinement for 48 hours

Usual appearance: Mercantel is New Mexico's Corrections Secretary who is intent on overhauling the prison system, particularly what he believes is an overuse of solitary confinement

Marcantel wants to overhaul the state's prison system, and do away with what Marcantel believes is an over-reliance on solitary confinement.

Segregating prisoners in solitary cells costs up to three times as much as it does to house the general prison population and can make prisoners even more dangerous, according to some critics.

Marcantel told ABC News that in order to bring about change, he needed to experience the prison system from the inside.

'You really need to feel it. You need to taste it, you need to smell it, you need to see it, firsthand,' he said.

Following the 1980 riot at the Penitentiary of New Mexico, one of the country's most violent prison riots in history, the policy became to place any prisoner who was acting up in solitary confinement, in an attempt to avoid a repeat of the horrific events.

During the 1980 riot, 33 inmates were killed and more than 200 sustained injuries. Seven corrections officers were treated for injuries caused by beatings and rapes.

Level Six: Between them, the 282 prisoners in solitary at New Mexico State Penitentiary have killed 138 people, reports ABC

Experience: Marcantel in his 12-foot by seven-foot solitary confinement cell

Relief: Marcantel had to spend 48 hours in the cell, but some prisoner spend years without having any human contact except for prison guards

But 
Marcantel doesn't think that solitary confinement is necessary for any 
but the most dangerous criminals - and that for some, it could make them
 worse.

'We are sending them back to our neighborhoods worse than when they came... I can’t allow that,' he said.

Back on the job: Marcantel says that while he wouldn't want to repeat it, his 48 hours in solitary was a valuable experience

'Segregation should be a last resort,' Marcantel told ABC News. 'We have to be very careful about how we use it.'

Some
 of the other 282 men housed in solitary confinement along with 
Mercantel had been there for years, allowed one hour outside in a 
concrete cage per day, and no human contact except the guards holding 
their arms.

'Not
 sure I want to do it again, but I am really glad I did it,” he said of 
the experience afterwards, which saw him suffering from boredom, 
claustrophobia and nausea.

Marcantel pretended to be deaf so that when other inmates questioned him about who he is, he didn't have to respond.

Following his time behind bars, Marcantel has already begun reforming the system.

However, he doesn't plan to do away with the punishment altogether.

'There is such a thing as evil,' he told ABC. 'It’s not whether or not they are going to hurt people — they started hurting people when they were four years old - and it’s up to me to make sure that not only am I protecting other inmates from them, but I am also protecting my staff from them.'

Marcantel said the most dangerous criminals must be kept segregated, but that other prisoners should be punished in different ways, such as the removal of privileges.

Eight of the prisoners housed in the Sante Fe Pen's solitary confinement unit have been brought out of Level Six solitary in preparation to rejoin the general prison following Marcantel's stay in solitary.
