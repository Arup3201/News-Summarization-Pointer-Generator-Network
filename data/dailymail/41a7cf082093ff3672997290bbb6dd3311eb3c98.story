Shocking footage has emerged showing a Palestinian knifeman murdering a young Israeli woman, as it was revealed she survived a similar terrorist knife attack at the same location nine years ago.

The video shows Dalia Lemkus, 25, being run over and repeatedly stabbed by a man identified as 30-year-old Mahar al-Hashmalud outside the Jewish settlement of Alon Shvut in the Gush Etzion area of the West Bank yesterday.

Two others were injured in al-Hashmalud's knife rampage, which took place shortly after another Palestinian stabbed an Israeli soldier to death in a separate attack at a Tel Aviv train station.

The disturbing CCTV footage emerged as it was revealed South Africa-born Miss Lemkus had survived a terrorist stabbing in Gush Etzion in 2006, when she was among a group of three hitchhikers attacked by a Palestinian extremist.

Run down: The video shows Dalia Lemkus, 25, being run over and repeatedly stabbed by a man identified as 30-year-old Mahar al-Hashmalud. Pictured is al-Hashmalud's white car ploughing into the West Bank bus stop

Attack: After killing Dalia Lemkus, Mahar al-Hashmalud turns his knife on passers-by (pictured) who tried to help her. A security guard then repeatedly shoots al-Hashmalud in the chest, leaving him in a serious condition

Victim: South Africa-born Dalia Lemkus, 25, had previously survived a terrorist stabbing in Gush Etzion in 2006, when she was among a group of three hitchhikers attacked by a Palestinian extremist

The sickening footage of Miss Lemkus' murder shows a man identified by the International Business Times as Mahar al-Hashmalud driving a white people carrier-style vehicle at high speed towards a group of people waiting at a bus stop.

At least one person is seen being struck by the car, which comes close to overturning before disappearing out of shot. It is believed Miss Lemkus was the person hit by the vehicle.

Al-Hashmalud, who hails from the West Bank city of Hebron, is then seen running back to the bus stop, standing over the stricken Miss Lemkus and repeatedly stabbing her in the neck, before turning his knife on a passer-by who tries to intervene.

The knifeman then charges at a third person who pulled his car over in the hope of stopping the attack. As a fight breaks out between the two men, a security guard arrives and shoots al-Hashmalud, who attempts to makes off down the street.

He was shot several more times in the chest while attempting to flee and was taken to hospital in a serious condition. Both passers-by who tried to intervene suffered non-life threatening knife wounds.

In an eerie twist, Miss Lemkus' murder came nine years almost nine years after she was involved in a similar knife attack in Gush Etzion.

Just six years after her family moved to the West Bank from South Africa, she was among a group of three teenage hitchhikers suffering non-serious stab injuries at a well-known pick-up station.

Her funeral took place earlier this morning, with hundreds turning out to pay their last respects to the ambulance driver and medical care volunteer. 

Miss Lemkus' death came shortly after an Israeli soldier was stabbed to death in a separate incident at a train station in Tel Aviv yesterday, and shortly before a third attempted stabbing in Jerusalem.

In the latter incident a Palestinian man attempted to stab a security guard on the Light Rail system but was caught and arrested.

The attacks are said to be in response to tensions over a holy site in the city of Jerusalem, which sits on the border of Israel and the West Bank.

Israeli-Palestinian tensions have festered over access to a Jerusalem compound housing Islam's third holiest site, and where Biblical Jewish temples once stood.

Stone-throwing protests have also erupted in several Arab
towns in Israel since Saturday, when police killed a youth
who assaulted them.

There was no immediate Palestinian comment after the
attacks in Tel Aviv and the West Bank.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, addressed the Tel Aviv assault in The Knesset.

He said: 'Terror ... is being directed at
all parts of the country for a simple reason: the terrorists,the inciters, want to drive us from everywhere.'

'As far as they are concerned, we should not be in
Jerusalem, Tel Aviv or anywhere. I can promise you one thing -
they will not succeed. We will continue to fight terror ... and
we will defeat it together,' he said.

Five days ago, a Palestinian rammed his car into pedestrians
in central Jerusalem, the second such incident of its kind in as
many weeks, killing two Israelis. Police shot the driver dead.

Police and emergency services at the scene. The injured soldier was taken to Sheva Hospital in Tel Aviv

Double tragedy: Police and ambulances are seen arriving at the scene of the first attack, just hours before one woman was stabbed to death and two others injured in a separate incident on the West Bank

Eyewitness accounts said a young Palestinian man attempted to grab the soldier's weapon, after which he stabbed the him in his stomach
