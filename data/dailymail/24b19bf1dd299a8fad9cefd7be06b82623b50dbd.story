A man on a zero-hours contract was so scared of losing work by calling in sick he went in with a blood clot on his brain. 

Latvian Guntars Zarins, 52, feared he would have received a 'strike' against his name if he had taken a day off from his job at the Sports Direct warehouse in Bolsover, Derbyshire.

Instead of phoning doctors and calling in sick, the 52-year-old dragged himself to the depot - but the father-of-two collapsed at work and was rushed to hospital on December 19.

Instead of phoning doctors and calling in sick the 52-year-old dragged himself to the depot (pictured) in Bolsover, Derbyshire before collapsing

He is now out of a coma having undergone a life-saving operation to drain the blood from his brain - but he remains paralysed.

His family claim that taking a day off ill can result in a strike against a worker's name and that after three or four strikes, workers can be fired. 

Mr Zarins came to Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, from Latvia four years ago and usually works five days a week at the depot.

In the run up to Christmas he was working six days a week and had worked for the company for four years, earning the minimum wage.

In the days leading to his collapse, he had suffered flu-like symptoms but had continued going to work.

Mr Zarins had had a tracheotomy fitted just a couple of months before after a chest infection.

His family are now continually by his bedside because he is still in a critical condition after suffering an embolism. He is paralysed down one half of his body, despite being conscious.

Daughter Liga, 28, and her partner Kris Shaw, 34, who also works in a warehouse, are set to get married on January 3 - and Mr Zarins will not be fit enough to make it.

They will go to the hospital on their wedding day so Mr Zarins can see his daughter in her wedding dress and give her away to Mr Shaw.

She claimed taking a day off ill can result in a strike against a worker's name. After three or four strikes, she says, workers can be fired.

Liga, who lives in Kirkby, Merseyside, said: 'About a week before my dad collapsed he started complaining about fever, bad chest and headaches.

'We just thought it was because of the cold weather and we told him to take some time off. But he said "I can't because I'll get a strike".

'In the days leading up to it his cough was getting heavier and he was looking more and more tired, I can't believe they didn't tell him to go home.

'The doctors said that the stress of working six days a week would have pushed him over the edge.'

Mr Zarins' wife, Lena, 50, works as a cleaner at the warehouse, which employs 5,000 people.

Mr Shaw said that when Mr Zarins collapsed, they did not receive a phone call from Sports Direct.

Liga said: 'Every day he's improving and we're looking forward to the new year when we can hopefully see some progress.

'Though doctors have said we shouldn't expect a miracle and that a lot of hard work and patience is required.'
