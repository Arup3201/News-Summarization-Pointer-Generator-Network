The BBC’s voice of golf Peter Alliss has spoken of his ‘great sadness’ at the prospect of the corporation losing live coverage of The Open Championship to Sky. ‘I’m just glad I am 83 not 35 and reliant on working for the BBC’s sports department, because I think I would be looking for another trade,’ he said.

Alliss believes the writing has been on the wall for years, but is disappointed his employers haven’t done more to keep the R&A happy. ‘In one sense it seems to me it’s like playing poker against Donald Trump or Warren Buffett in that the BBC can’t compete against Sky’s bottomless pockets of money,’ he said. ‘And you can’t deny Sky do a fantastic job. 

'You might be annoyed at the adverts but they go to faraway places and cover these events even though there might be only eight people watching on Thursday. Their commitment to show everything is extraordinary.

‘But, hand on heart, I can’t not criticise the BBC. They are far and away the R&A’s biggest television client, so why haven’t they said to them: “You know, we’re struggling against the financial might of Sky but why don’t we also cover some of the other events you run, like the Amateur Championship and the Boys Championship and the Walker Cup?” We used to do those events years ago, so why not again? I think it would have shown the R&A that they cared. I definitely think going back there were people who fought harder to keep tournaments on the BBC. At one point we covered 18 events.

‘Now you look at the move up to Manchester and how many millions that cost, and you wonder about the value in that. This week we’ve got two or three hours of indoor bowls on each day which of course is of great interest to the people who play it but no interest at all to anyone else. I guess for some people it’s progress but for people like you and I, it seems a move in the opposite direction.’

The ‘crown jewels’ are a list of prestigious sporting events of national importance which may interest non-sports fans. The events are protected under the 1996 Broadcasting Act, which ensures they are shown on free-to-air television — such as the BBC. Delayed highlights of the B-list events also have to be shown on terrestrial television.

Crown Jewels:

- Olympic Games

- World Cup and European Championship finals

- English and Scottish FA Cup finals

- The Grand National and the Derby

- Wimbledon tennis finals

- Rugby Union’s World Cup final

- Rugby League’s Challenge Cup final

B-list:

- England Test matches — exclusive UK live coverage on Sky Sports since 2006

- Wimbledon non-finals play — live coverage on BBC

- All other matches in Rugby World Cup finals — all 2015 matches will be shown live on ITV or ITV4

- The Open — live on BBC until 2016

- The Ryder Cup — exclusive UK live coverage on Sky Sports since 1995

- Cricket World Cup — shown on Sky Sports since 1992, every match live since 2003

- Commonwealth Games — live on BBC

- World Athletics Championships — live coverage on BBC until at least 2017

- Six Nations matches involving home countries — live coverage on BBC until at least 2017

As you can probably gather, this is a subject on which the great man feels rightly passionate. How could it be any other way since he’s worked for the BBC since 1961? ‘It’s been a large part of my life and I have enjoyed every minute of it and it seems to be really sad that it’s all coming to an end largely because of money,’ he said.

‘But this is the way of the world, I suppose. I never thought the Masters would be taken away from the BBC, for example, or rather the rights split with Sky. Augusta don’t have a money tree, rather a money orchard, but you get one or two new people on a committee who see this carrot dangled in front of them, and I guess that’s the same with the R&A.

‘But I’m not sure the R&A balance the books in the best way. They’re very generous to golf clubs who have parts of their course eroded by the sea and do great deeds around the world. But think about the audiences the BBC get for the Masters over Sky. It’s always five times as much. Shouldn’t the R&A take those figures into account, when participation levels in the game are falling?’ 

Negotiations between the R&A. the BBC and Sky over live rights for The Open from next year are expected to be concluded over the next fortnight. It is widely expected that coverage thereafter on the BBC will be restricted to highlights packages each evening.

Former Open Champion Tony Jacklin, who worked alongside Alliss at the BBC for many years, agrees it will be a ‘sad day’ if The Open is no longer aired live on free-to-air television. But, given the BBC’s apparent state of apathy, he can fully understand why the R&A are likely to jump ship.

‘It was wonderful to work for the BBC when they were fully committed to golf but they appear ready to withdraw altogether now, and so who can blame the R&A if they give the rights to Sky?’ he said. ‘The world turns, and Sky have done such a wonderful job for the European Tour and are so professional in their coverage.’

As for Alliss, he has no plans for retirement. ‘Although I’m creaking and groaning a bit these days I’m still lively from the chin upwards and still have opinions,’ he said. ‘I still enjoy it, and I’ll be at the Masters, The Open and women’s Open. I just feel so sorry for all those who have enjoyed live golf on the BBC over many years and all those millions who can’t afford Sky. Let’s hope a deal can be done that looks after these people.’
