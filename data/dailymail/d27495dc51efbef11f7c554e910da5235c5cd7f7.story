Vet Awuah Ohene-Gyan left was found guilty of causing animal suffering on Thursday

A cruel vet kept sick pets in squalor, botched operations and even held one dog ransom until their owner agreed to pay for more treatment - a court has heard.

Aquah Ohene-Gyan was found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to animals after he allowed desperate creatures to escape from his surgery and frequently carried out bogus tests to bump up his fees.

The 53-year-old from Clapham, in South London, failed to show up to his court case on Thursday and magistrates heard a shocking catalogue of abuses in his absence.

Justices were told that two dogs had to be put down after police raided Woosehill Vets, in Wokingham, after responding to a protest held outside the surgery by angry customers.

They found one dog - who had lost her hind legs to cancer - dragging herself through a pool of her own faeces and urine with her front paws.

Horrified officers took the dog and other pets to another vet in nearby Reading, but she had to be put down due to a tumour that had gone undiscovered by Ohene-Gyan.

Sgt Stefan Kristiaan said: 'It was a painful sight; the animal appeared wasted away, it was very 
thin and its bones appeared to be protruding.'

Reading Magistrates' Court heard how another dog also had to be put to sleep because she was suffering chronic 
renal failure due to being kept in a squalid cage that was much too small for
her.

And how officers seized one dog, a Lurcher named 
Red, who had been kept ransom by Ohene-Gyan after her owner refused to pay the bill of
an X-ray carried out without his permission.

Staff claimed the animal, who was still suffering from a ruptured Achilles tendon, was only being treated with mild painkillers and was sometimes kept in a cage for up to 23 hours a day.

Ohene-Gyan also failed to operate on an injured cat correctly, after it had been hit by a car and dislocated its ankle.

He did pin the dislocated bones 
together, but did nothing to prevent the bone from rotating - causing 
the creature excruciating pain.

The court was told that Ohene-Gyan refused to refer any of his animal patients to specialists because to do so 
would be bad for business.

In one incident two cats escaped from the surgery after 
being taken in for neutering by their owners, who were only informed when they went to collect their animals.

Another cat died during a minor operation and a puppy almost lost his leg due to bandages being applied too tightly.

Giving evidence as the trial, veterinary nurse Shirley Schreiber said she had worked for Ohene-Gyan, but quit at 
the end of her three month probation period in October 2010.

Mrs Schreiber said the defendant, 
originally from Ghana, had shown her around his new practice Ashlyn 
House Vets in Binfield, Berks., and she had been impressed with its 
cleanliness.

However, she was appalled when she commenced work at Woosehill Vets, which she described as 'the complete opposite'.

'It was a shambles and the kennels were a
mess,' confirming to Paul Taylor, prosecuting, that she she would often
find medicine and syringes lying about.

Mrs Schreiber said she would clean the 
cages as they became dirty, and always at the end of her working day, 
but that when Ohene-Gyan was there alone at night he would simply move 
the animals to another cage.

She said that often he would leave the 
patient notes on the original cage, which could lead to mix ups, as had 
happened with two female Staffordshire Bull Terriers.

'The two dogs were the same colour, they
were similar dogs and we did not know which one was which or who they 
belonged to,' she said.

'We had to wait for the owner to come in to tell us which was their’s.'

Mrs Schreiber said that this confusion 
meant that some animals would go without treatment because the type of 
medication they needed would be unknown.

And that Ohene-Gyan would
refuse to carry out simple surgical procedures such as spaying and once
ordered her to tell an owner that their dog needed further treatment to
delay the procedure until another vet arrived the following day.

She said: 'He instructed me to tell the owner the dog had a high temperature and required fluids overnight.

'He never even checked the dog’s temperature and he didn’t put the dog on a drip.'

She added: 'He said "I can do bitch spays and cat spays but I’d rather not," he said "they’re really messy".'

Mrs Schreiber said that when she had seen him 
perform a castration operation on an animal he had taken around an hour,
when another vet would take just 10 to 20 minutes.

And on another occasion she said she had to 
tell her boss that he had mistakenly read an X-ray which led him to believe that cartilage was broken ribs.

He also refused to diagnose a visibly flea-ridden cat until it had a blood test.

Once he told her that a rabbit which had
been in the surgery for several weeks had come in to be euthanised, but
he could not be sure so just left the animal, which was suffering from 
an abscess on its chin.

Another vet later treated the rabbit and Mrs Schreiber found it a new home, where it has lived healthily ever since.

The court was told that Ohene-Gyan would
advertise his cheap services, including spaying, but would then bump up
the price by charging for unnecessary treatments such as putting the 
animals on a drip.

The defendant had denied the charges but was found guilty on four counts of causing 
unnecessary suffering to an animal and four of failing in his duty to 
ensure animal welfare.

The case was adjourned for sentencing on June 20.
