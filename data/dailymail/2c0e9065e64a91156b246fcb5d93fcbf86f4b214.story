Six Nations champions Ireland returned home to their native country as heroes after retaining the title in spectacular fashion in Scotland.

The tournament went right down to the wire with England, Wales and the Irish all in with a chance of lifting the trophy.

But it was the reigning champions who triumphed thanks to an emphatic 40-10 over the Scots - who lost every game in this year's competition.

Joe Schmidt's side were on course for the Grand Slam after impressing in the opening three fixtures but defeat in Wales, opened up the Six Nations title race and made sure it came down to the final day.

Two tries from Sean O'Brien, one for Paul O'Connoll and Jared Payne completed a comfortable victory for the Irish and it was left to England needing to score 26-points to claim the title.

Unfortunately for Stuart Lancaster's side it was too much of an ask with a mixture of poor defending and individual errors playing their part in conceding sloppy tries.

Winning by 20 points just wasn't enough and Ireland's players were left celebrating at the end of the final game before receiving the coveted Six Nations trophy.

It was the first time Ireland retained the title since 1949 and upon their return you could see what it meant to the country with hundreds of people turning out to greet them.
