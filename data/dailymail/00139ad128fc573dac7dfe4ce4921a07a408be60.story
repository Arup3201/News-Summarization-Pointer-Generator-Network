The highly-trained police officers were more concerned about the contents of the Man Haron Monis' backpack than his firearm when they stormed the Lindt cafe in the chilling final seconds of the Sydney siege.

The six State Protection Group officers were ordered to enter the Martin Place building immediately after cafe manager Tori Johnson was shot in the head by the gunman, reports the Daily Telegraph.

The crucial movements of the SPG officers have been praised as 'text book entry' by those within the police force, as the specially-trained squad displayed a calm and composed nature despite their suspicions that Monis was strapped with an explosive.

'They (the SPG) knew as soon the hostage was shot … that they would be going through that door,' a senior police source told The Daily Telegraph.

'The team who went through the doors still thought there were bombs (inside). They were more worried about the backpack than the gun.'

'They were confronted by a man with what they think is a bomb strapped to him and firing a gun at them as they’re going in.'

Once Monis was killed, the next concern for the officers was getting the remainder of the female hostages out of the building as safely as possible.

It was only then that the officers had time to think about themselves and fled the cafe as the contents of the backpack attached to the gunman's back were still unknown.

The Bomb Squad then entered the building and discovered that despite wires hanging out of Monis' backpack - it did not contain explosives.

Instead, he claimed Monis (pictured) was only seeking attention and was motivated by his problems with the government and his limited ability to contact his children

Meanwhile, tapes of the man responsible for the Martin Place terror plot delivering religious rants, saying 'Society should behave in an Islamic manner', have been unearthed.

In 2009, the self-styled sheik - five years before he carried out the 16-hour attack where he held 18 people hostage in Martin Place's Lindt Cafe in Sydney's CBD last month - imparted his extremist views to a crowd inside a prayer hall in the city's western suburbs.

The December siege, which shocked Australia and sparked an outpouring of grief from across the nation, ended with the deaths of cafe manager Tori Johnson and mother-of-three Katrina Dawson - who worked as a barrister at nearby law chambers Eight Selborne.

The footage, translated by a Farsi translator for The Daily Telegraph, slammed overseas government who experienced the most violent of crimes, saying: 'your intelligence service is not working properly'.

He believed governments who were 'not aware that there [was] criminal activity happening in your country' then officials should resign from their positions as they were 'incompetent'.

At times, Monis became so passionate he was seen thumping his fists to drive home his message.

Showing his level of paranoia, the terrorist also warned one of the biggest threats against fundamentalist Muslims lay within their community. 

Monis and two of his hostages, Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson, were killed in the bloody conclusion to the siege in the early hours of December 16

Monis believed moderate Muslims would spell the death of extremists.

Canvassing what he thought was the virtues of Sharia law, he pushed the case for Australia to take on more of the Islamic culture.

'The core of an Islamic society is justice, social justice. Society should behave in an Islamic manner and there should be justice,' he said.

In the same year he fell off the radar of intelligence agencies, Monis warned about keeping an eye on 'friends' who assimilated into the community before delivering terror.

'An enemy would bluntly claim that they are the enemy. An ignorant friend claims that they are friends and they approach you, you would socialise with them and associate with them, but one day like a bear, they lift a big stone and they hit it to the face of that person and kills him,' he said.

Monis went on to say people should fear the ones who declared 'Islam is in jeopardy'. 

Adding to the terrifying picture that has been pieced together of Monis over the past couple of weeks following the siege, friends of the gunman said he was an enigma who set up political party Hezbollah Australia and funded a Campsie warehouse to be turned into a prayer hall.

Mamdouh Habib (pictured), who was assisted by Monis in 2007 when he sought Labor's seat in Sydney's western suburb of Auburn, said he knew Man Haron Monis 'very well' and insisted that the Sydney siege gunman was 'not violent'

Refugee advocate Jamal Daoud told News Corp he did not know where Monis' money was sourced and the terrorist was 'mysterious'.

Mr Daoud added the gunman was good at networking from both sides of the Muslim community - Sunni and Shia, saying 'He knew a lot about everybody, they knew nothing about him'.

The advocate said Monis worshiped at different mosques around Sydney, which included Granville's Nabi Akram Islamic Centre, in Sydney's west - a location where these religious rants were given.

The way Monis spoke was described as 'slow' and 'low-pitched'.

Mr Daoud said the gunman was a 'very good listener' who 'wasn't stupid, he's intelligent'. 

It comes after former failed politician and Guantánamo Bay detainee, who previously employed gunman Monis, claimed he could have convinced the 50-year-old to end the Sydney siege without resorting to violence.

His offer was one of many put forward by other Muslim community members, including the Grand Mufti, Ibrahim Abu Mohamed (pictured). All of these are believed to have been rejected

Mamdouh Habib, who was assisted by Monis in 2007 when he sought Labor's seat in Sydney's western suburb of Auburn, told Fairfax he knew him 'very well' and insisted that Monis was 'not violent'. 

Despite this show of support, Monis will be buried in an undisclosed location in Melbourne after the Sydney Muslim community reportedly refused to bury him.

The wrongly accused former Guantánamo Bay detainee, who was tortured after being arrested in Pakistan under the false pretences he had knowledge of the September 11 attacks, claimed Monis was only seeking attention.

Mr Habib offered to help negotiate with the gunman during the siege, and maintains that Monis, while 'sick and disturbed' was motivated by his problems with the government and his limited ability to contact his children.

He insistently told Fairfax he believed Monis had no intention of harming any of the 18 people he took hostage at the Lindt Café in Martin Place on December 15, nor that his attack was associated with motivations linked to terrorist organisation the Islamic State.

His offer of help police negotiate with the 50-year-old was one of many put forward by other Muslim community members, including the Grand Mufti, Ibrahim Abu Mohamed. All of these are believed to have been rejected.

Meanwhile, Monis' body has finally been claimed by some of his anonymous acquaintances, and will be buried somewhere in Melbourne within the next few days, according to the Telegraph.

It follows claims from the Muslim community no Muslim funeral home would accept him as his body remained in the morgue unclaimed, days after the siege had ended. 

An Islamic State propaganda magazine lavished Monis' with praise for the siege, labelling the hostage crisis a 'daring raid' and calling for more lone wolf attacks in Australia
