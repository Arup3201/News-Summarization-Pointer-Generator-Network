Philip Seymour Hoffman's dying wish was to keep his children in Manhattan - and away from Hollywood, according to reports.

The actor's will, which was written in 2004, asked for his then-only child Cooper to be raised in New York City so he would be surrounded by the city's rich culture, arts and architecture.

If it was not possible for Cooper to be raised in New York, Hoffman asked that his son be raised in Chicago or San Francisco - or at least visit the cities twice a year.

TMZ noted
 the absence of Los Angeles from the list. It was penned by Hoffman nearly 10 
years before he was found dead from a heroin overdose two weeks ago.

Requests: Philip Seymour Hoffman, who died earlier this month, asked that his son Cooper (right) be raised in Manhattan, Chicago or San Francisco in his will, which was penned 10 years ago

'It is my strong desire…that my son, Cooper Hoffman, be raised and reside in or near the borough of Manhattan…or Chicago, Illinois, or San Francisco, California,' Hoffman's will reads.

'The purpose of this request is so that my son will be exposed to the culture, arts and architecture that such cities offer.'

Most of his fortune was left to his longtime partner and the mother of his three children, costume designer Marianne 'Mimi' O’Donnell, whom he identifies as his 'friend and companion'.

After Cooper, now 10, the couple had Tallulah, now seven, and Willa, five.

The will indicates he also set up a trust for Cooper, 
which he said should be used to pay for Cooper's 'education, support, 
health and maintenance'.

Close: Hoffman and his former partner were estranged but he still saw the children most days

Cooper will get half of the money when he turns 25, and the rest at age 30, according to court papers shared by the New York Post.

It is not known how much his estate is worth, but some estimates have placed it around $35 million.

Court
 sources added to The Post that the family have asked that the 
Oscar-winning actor's estate be handled by a judge on an expedited basis
 – a sign that the family needs cash.

The children's parents became estranged last year when Hoffman slipped back into using heroin, but O'Donnell lived nearby in their $4.2 million apartment.

But Hoffman remained close to his children, seeing them most days. He was also regularly spotted taking Cooper to basketball games.

'My spare time is really about hanging out with my kids,' Hoffman once told Us Weekly. 'If I'm free, a good chunk of that is going to be thinking about how to hang out with them.'

Loss: The couple became estranged last year reportedly after Hoffman resumed his heroine habit

Hoffman,
 46, was found dead on February 2 in his $10,000-a-month West Village 
apartment surrounded by 70 bags of heroin and 20 used syringes, less than a year after he completed a stint in rehab for his addiction.

The actor, who won an Oscar for 'Copote', was remembered at a funeral on February 6, where O'Donnell was seen comforting the sobbing children.

Investigators have determined that Hoffman made six ATM transactions for a total of $1,200 inside a supermarket near his home the day before his death.

Three people were later arrested during the investigation into the source of the drugs, including a long-time friend and 'drug dealer', Robert Vineberg.
