The self-proclaimed Muslim hater who pushed a New York immigrant into an oncoming subway train allegedly told a detective that she heartlessly killed the man because she 'thought it was cool.'

Erika Menendez, 31, who was found fit to stand trial in Queens today and entered a plea of not guilty, expressed no remorse when she told detectives her senseless motive which ended the life of 46-year-old Sunando Sen last December.

'I'm prejudice,' she said according to the New York Post. 'I pushed him in front of the train because I thought it was cool.'

Mentally fit: Erika Menendez, seen after her arrest for the death of 46-year-old Sunando Sen last December, was found fit to stand trial today but denied her family-retained attorney out of distrust

Menendez additionally dumped her family-retained attorney for a court-appointed attorney on Wednesday, footing any resulting bill to tax payers out of fear of her family’s manipulation.

'She indicated she doesn't want our representation because of distrust with her family,' privately hired attorney Thomas A Kenniff told the Post.

Mr Kenniff tried to persuade the Queens judge to 'not use tax payers' money when the family can afford [an attorney].'

‘I hate my family, I don't care, I don't want your medicine, I know what I am doing,’ an earlier statement from Menendez while held at the 112th Precinct was read by Assistant District Attorney Peter Lomp according to the Post.

When Mr Kenniff’s request was denied by the judge, to the visual disapproval of both Menendez’s mother and sister who were seated in the courtroom, he offered to work alongside court-appointed attorney Joseph DeFelice.

Motive: Menendez allegedly told detectives that she killed the Indian-born man both because she thought it was cool and because she saw it as revenge for the 9/11 attack which she blamed her victim for

Victim: Sunando Sen was standing on a subway platform in Queens when he was allegedly pushed by Menendez onto the tracks

Mr Kenniff said that though Menendez suffers psychological issues, mainly paranoia having to do with her family according to psychologists, she was twice found fit to stand trial.

DeFelice entered a not guilty plea for the woman charged with second-degree murder as a hate crime and plans to submit a bail application for her at the next April 18 court hearing.

Earlier in January Menendez gave an interview from Rikers Island where she is being held in custody, telling the Post that she was furious the day she ended the life of the hard-working Indian man.

'My mind was just racing that day. I was mad. I was just angry,' Menendez said.

'I was homeless. I was hungry. I was fighting with my boyfriend. He came running up the stairs, and I just got up and pushed him.'

Sen hardly had time to react.

'He was trying to shake me off,' she told The Post.

Revenge: Clad in a prison jumpsuit with glassy eyes and greasy hair, Menendez, pictured right, professed her hatred for Muslims and Hindus and said the murder of Sen, a Hindu, left, was revenge for 9/11

Clad in a prison jumpsuit with glassy
eyes and greasy hair, Menendez professed her hatred for Muslims and 
Hindus and told The Post the murder of Sen, a Hindu, was revenge for 
9/11.

But the massive loss of life that still haunts the nation isn't what enraged her.

'I'm not mad about the people. I'm mad because I liked the buildings,' Menendez said. 'I just wanted to hurt Muslims and Hindus ever since (9/11).'

She loved the World Trade Center buildings because she is a native New Yorker, she said.

She hardly showed emotion during the interview, The Post reported, but her eyes lit up when she began describing other attacks on people she believed were Muslim or Hindu.

'I've been beating up Muslims and Hindus for a long time. I just want to hurt them. I would punch them,' she said.

She told The Post that on December 29, Sen stood out from the other subway riders because of his religion but the horrific death may have been averted if she'd taken her medicine.

Jailed: The interview took place at Rikers Island jail complex, pictured, where Menendez is being held

The mentally ill woman, who was last 
week deemed fit to stand trial, revealed to The Post that she hadn't 
taken her drugs that day because she hates the side effects, which make 
her 'shaky.'

She said she prefers to 'self-medicate' by smoking marijuana but she hadn't smoked a 'blunt' that day.

'If I smoked a blunt that day, I wouldn't have pushed him,' Menendez said.

As the remorseless woman described the subway killing, which was the second in a month in New York, Sen's friends struggled to come to terms with his tragic death.

'How could she do this to him? My hands shake. I can't be alone. I think of him all the time, all the time,' the woman he rented a room from in Queens told The Post.

She said her son was now scared to ride the subway.

'We were family. Who cares if he is Muslim or Hindu? He was a man,' she said.
