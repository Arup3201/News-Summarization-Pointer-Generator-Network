A 350-million-year-old scorpion fossil is thought be the oldest known land-living animal in the Southern Hemisphere supercontinent, Gondwana.

Gondwana was a giant ancient continent made up of the land masses now known as South America, Australia, Antarctica, Madagascar and India.

The specimen was discovered in rocks from the Devonian Witteberg Group near Grahamstown, South Africa by Dr Robert Gess, from the Evolutionary Studies Institute at Wits University.

The fossil discovery, which included this pictured sting of the scorpion, represent  the earliest record of a land living animal in Gondwana. Gondwana was a giant ancient continent made up of the land masses now known as South America, Australia, Antarctica, Madagascar and India

 Gondwana was a giant ancient 
continent made up of the land masses now known as South America, 
Australia, Antarctica, Madagascar and India.

The first stage of its breakup began in the early Jurassic Period, about 180 million years ago.

The name Gondwanaland was coined by the Austrian geologist Eduard Suess in reference to Upper Paleozoic and Mesozoic formations in the Gondwana region of central India.

The fossil has been identified as a new species of scorpion called Gondwanascorpio emzantsiensis.

Dr Gess claims that this 350-million-year-old fossil will allow scientists to confirm some long-held ideas about early life.

Scientist know that Laurasia -the single northern landmass then comprising what is today North America and Asia - was inhabited by diverse invertebrates 420 million years ago.

But this supercontinent was at the time separated from the southerly positioned Gondwana by a deep ocean.

‘Evidence on the earliest colonisation of land animals has up till now come only from the northern hemisphere continent of Laurasia, and there has been no evidence that Gondwana was inhabited by land living invertebrate animals at that time,’ explained Dr Gess.

‘For the first time we know for certain that not just scorpions, but whatever they were preying on were already present in the Devonian [which occurred around 416 million years ago]

‘We now know that by the end the Devonian period Gondwana also, like Laurasia, had a complex terrestrial ecosystem, comprising invertebrates and plants which had all the elements to sustain terrestrial vertebrate life that emerged around this time or slightly later,’ he said.

Dr Gess explained that early life was initially confined to the sea and the process of moving life to land began during the Silurian Period about 420 million years ago.

The first wave of life to move out from water onto land consisted of plants, which gradually increased in size and complexity throughout the Devonian Period.

This initial colonisation of land was followed by plant and debris-eating invertebrate animals such as primitive insects and millipedes.

By the end of the Silurian period about 416 million years ago, predatory invertebrates such as scorpions and spiders were feeding on the earlier colonists of land.

In 2007 scientists discovered a 390 million year-old fossilised claw of an ancient sea scorpion that showed these creatures are larger than previously thought.

The fossils indicated that the scorpion weighed an estimated 400lb and was armed with savage 18-inch claws.

At the time of the discovery, Dr Simon Braddy, of the Department of Earth Sciences at Bristol University, said it proved that ancient spiders, insects and crabs would have been giants.

‘We have known for some time that the fossil record yields monster millipedes, scorpions, cockroaches, and dragonflies but we never realised, until now, just how big some of these ancient creepycrawlies were,’ he said.
