Pledge: Lord Ashcroft plans to leave at least half of his £1.2billion fortune to charity

Billionaire businessman and Tory peer Lord Ashcroft is set to give at least half of his £1.2billion fortune to charity. 

Next month it is believed the former Tory treasurer will sign up to the Giving Pledge - a commitment by the world's wealthiest individuals and families to dedicate the majority of their wealth to philanthropy. 

The movement is led by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates - two of America's richest men. 

Other Briton's who have already made the pledge include Sir Richard Branson and his wife Joan, John Caudwell, Michael Moritz and Harriet Heyman who have pledged a combined £3.7billion in total, according to The Sunday Times.

Ashcroft, 67, founded Crimestoppers and over the years has donated £20million to the cause. 

In the past year he has given £5m to Anglia Ruskin University; £1m to complete the Bomber Command war memorial in London and a further £1m to help refurbish the First World War galleries at the Imperial War Museum in London.

Back in 2008, Ashcroft, who is president of the West India Committee, wrote in his book Dirty Politics, Dirty Times: 'I have prepared my will. I have never been a great believer in inherited wealth. More than 80 per cent of my assets — and I never discuss how much I am worth — will be left to a charitable foundation in my name.'

The Giving Pledge was set up in 2010 and has quickly become popular among the world's richest families. There are now a total of 105 donors. 

Today a billionaire oligarch was named Britain's richest man in The Sunday Times Rich List.

Alisher Usmanov, who was born in Uzbekistan, owns almost one-third of Arsenal Football Club and is said to be worth £13.3billion.

Usmanov, 59, owns Sutton Place, the former Surrey home of the oil baron J. Paul Getty, as well as a £48million mansion in London.

He is married to Irina Viner, 64, the head coach of Russia’s rhythmic gymnastics team.

He replaces steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal, who now drops to fourth place after eight years in the top spot.

The steel magnate, now worth £10billion, is the biggest faller in wealth terms.
