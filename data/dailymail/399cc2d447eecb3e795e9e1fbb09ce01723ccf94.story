A grandfather-of-eight has been beaten to death after he accidentally backed into someone's car, police said.

Robert Sabio, 70, died in hospital from blunt force trauma following the horrifying road rage attack in Irvington, New Jersey on Friday.

Mr Sabio backed into another car at 11pm last Wednesday after driving a neighbor to Irvington as a favor.

The other car did not suffer major damage, according to police but the driver and passengers viciously assaulted Mr Sabio.

The 70-year-old, who is married and has eight grandchildren, was taken to University Hospital in Newark suffering from blunt-force trauma. He died two days later.

Mr Sabio had offered to give his neighbor a lift after watching his grandson's Little League game, where he was a regular presence on the sidelines.

His wife of 43 years Linda told nj.com that 'no was not in his vocabulary' when it came to helping loved ones and friends.

Mr Sabio was also well known for playing Santa Claus at the Woodbridge and Short Hills malls over the holidays.

On Sunday, his daughter Robin Sabio Giachetti posted a picture of herself on her wedding day with her proud father along with the caption: 'Happy Father's Day dad & a special fathers day wish to the detectives who are working hard today to bring us some justice.'

He is survived by his wife, three daughters and eight grandchildren. His funeral will be held on Wednesday.

Police have so far made no arrests in the case but the Essex County Prosecutorâ€™s Office Homicide/Major Crimes Task Force tips asked anyone with information to call 877-847-7432.
