Scott Quigg will defend his WBA World super-bantamweight title against Hidenori Otake on the undercard of the blockbuster Nathan Cleverly-Tony Bellew rematch in Liverpool next month.

The Bury fighter has been touted for a domestic showdown with IBF beltholder Carl Frampton next year, but will have to navigate his way past the Japanese champion on November 22.

Quigg has stopped his last three opponents, and has not gone beyond the third round, but will face a step up in opposition for the fifth defence of his title.

Otake (22-1-3, 9KOs), who has never fought outside of Tokyo, has won his last 14 bouts and Quigg is taking nothing for granted ahead of potential future lucrative bouts down the road.

"Otake represents the toughest fight of my career and I'm working hard to put in a scintillating performance," said the 26-year-old.

"He is highly ranked and highly respected with an exciting style - I'm on a big run of KO's and I don't intend on stopping."

The bill also includes Olympic gold medallists James DeGale and Anthony Joshua and WBA World bantamweight title holder Jamie McDonnell.
