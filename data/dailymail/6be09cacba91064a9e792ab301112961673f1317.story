Prince Harry may have resigned himself to starting his 30s as a single man – but he’ll be less prepared for the news that the woman who was his first true love is set to announce her engagement.

Chelsy Davy is expected to reveal this week that she is marrying society jeweller Charles Goode.

The 28-year-old, who dated Harry on and off for seven years, has spent the past two weeks on a romantic holiday in Africa with Charles.

Inseparable: The couple have been inseparable since they began dating last year

The couple, who began dating last year, have been travelling through Zambia, Mozambique and Malawi, spending their time fishing, trekking and going on safari.

Last week they climbed to the peak of the 9,000ft Mount Mulanje, where Charles is thought to have popped the question.

A friend of the couple told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Charles was planning to propose on holiday and everyone thinks he has now done it. 

'He is off-comms out there, so if there is an announcement it will come this week when they return home.’

The pair have been inseparable since they met. Charles is a third-generation jeweller at Goode & Son, a brand worn by the Beckhams, Kate Moss and Kate Winslet.

Like Prince Harry, Charles is besotted by all things African, and earlier this year he designed a £2,600 bracelet for Liberty of London called Hope, based on the West African Adinkra symbol.

A friend of Charles and Chelsy revealed: ‘He made it pretty clear before he left for Africa that he wants to marry Chelsy.’

Intriguingly, Charles took to his Instagram page a month ago to post a picture of a gold and diamond ring resting on a log in Mozambique’s Pestana Bazaruto Lodge. 

He called it an ‘Antique Angel’ ring.

News of an engagement would come as a bittersweet moment for Harry. 

He still counts Chelsy as a close friend, but is said to readily admit that she has been the great love of his life. 

Many of the Prince’s friends regard Chelsy as ‘the right girl at the wrong time’.

The Zimbabwean’s sense of humour is said to be the reason their on-off relationship continued until 2012, when she finally ended it for good.

She reportedly told pals she didn’t want to be a full-time Royal, saying: ‘It’s not a life for me.’ 

She has since carved out a career for herself as a lawyer.

One source told The Mail on Sunday last night: ‘The years Harry was with Chelsy were some of the happiest of his life. 

'There has always been a sense that he might get back with her one day. 

'Of course, if she marries that will no longer be the case.’

With his 30th birthday next month, the Prince is understood to be anxious about being alone. 

Earlier this year he split from Cressida Bonas, and he is said to be worried that media attention makes it hard for him to find a long-term girlfriend.
