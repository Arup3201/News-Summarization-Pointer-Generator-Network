Manchester City are closing in on the signing of central defender Eliaquim Mangala from Porto. 

City have been monitoring the player’s performances for almost 18 months and are close to completing a £30million deal for the France international.

Sportsmail understands Mangala has had a medical but the City are ironing the finer details of what is a complicated deal involving third-party ownership.

City made a concerted effort to sign Mangala from the Portuguese side in January but they were unable to come to an agreement with Porto after they were quoted £50million for the double signing of midfielder Fernando and the defender. 

The club resolved to return for the pair this summer and they have since sealed the £12m purchase of Fernando and are now aiming to sign up his former team-mate. 

Mangala considered to be the perfect partner for Vincent Kompany at the heart of the Manchester City defence.
