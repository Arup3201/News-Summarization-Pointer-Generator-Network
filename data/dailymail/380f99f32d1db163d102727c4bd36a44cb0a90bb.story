Former children's TV presenter Floella Benjamin said she did not know how to protect our children from pornography found online

Former children’s TV presenter Floella Benjamin has warned of an ‘epidemic’ of violent online porn, which is leading youngsters on a ‘seemingly unstoppable march into a moral wasteland’.

Baroness Benjamin – who sits as a Lib Dem peer in the Lords – said girls were becoming increasingly sexualised while more and more boys were treating them as little more than ‘sexual objects’.

In an impassioned speech to mark today’s International Women’s Day, she said boys were pressurising girls into degrading behaviour.

‘I believe we have opened a Pandora’s box and I have no answer as to how we can reverse the trend of the sexual objectification of women and how to protect our children against its influence,’ she said.

The former Play School and Play Away presenter said violent pornography was ‘only a mouse click away’ and was a ‘pan-global epidemic’.

Too many children were growing up believing happiness could be gained purely by using sex as a commodity, she warned.

The Daily Mail has been calling for tough restrictions on web porn to protect youngsters.

David Cameron has promised protections whereby all new computers will be automatically fitted with web filters unless parents specifically lift them. But no timetable has been put in place to implement such a scheme.

The NSPCC has revealed that more than 5,000 under-18s have been questioned by the police over sex offences over the past three years

Last month a 15-year-old boy was 
convicted of raping a 14-year-old girl after becoming hooked on internet
 porn.

The NSPCC revealed that more than 5,000 under-18s have been 
questioned by police over sex offences in the past three years.

In her Lords speech, Baroness 
Benjamin said: ‘No wonder we witness highly sexualised behaviour by 
children and young people when they are being influenced so strongly to 
believe that stardom, success, fame, riches and happiness can be 
achieved by using sex as a commodity.’

The NSPCC revealed that more than 5,000 under-18s have been 
questioned by police over sex offences in the past three years.

In her Lords speech, Baroness 
Benjamin said: ‘No wonder we witness highly sexualised behaviour by 
children and young people when they are being influenced so strongly to 
believe that stardom, success, fame, riches and happiness can be 
achieved by using sex as a commodity.’

Baroness Benjamin attacked internet service providers for doing too little to shield youngsters from harmful material.

And she backed a charter of parents’ 
online rights, launched by the organisation The Parent Zone. Equalities 
minister Baroness Northover said the Government was determined to tackle
 violence against women and girls.

She said sex education guidelines for
 schools were aimed at ensuring ‘positive values’ for young people in 
their sexual relationships.

Warning of the dangers of 
‘sexualisation’ of young girls, Lady Northover said ministers were 
implementing recommendations from a report last year, which included 
stricter advertising guidelines.

Alan Wardle, head of public affairs 
at the NSPCC, said: ‘This is an issue we are extremely concerned about. 
It’s one of the main child-protection issues of our age.’

Trinidad-born Baroness Benjamin is 
also backing a bill presented by Baroness Howe, the wife of former Tory 
Chancellor Geoffrey Howe, to force ISPs to automatically block out all 
adult material – with those over 18 only being able to see it after 
specifically opting in following a strict age verification.

Daniel Boucher, director of parliamentary affairs at Christian charity CARE, said: 'The reality is that, unless the government takes action now, each generation of young people is at risk of developing severely warped perceptions of behavioural norms.

'Their understanding of self-worth and respect for themselves and their peers is continuously damaged by the sheer accessibility of sickeningly hardcore pornography.

'The government needs to take a bolder stand on child internet safety than they have to date by implementing the sort of robust age verification measures set out in the seminal Online Safety Bill currently in the House of Lords.'
