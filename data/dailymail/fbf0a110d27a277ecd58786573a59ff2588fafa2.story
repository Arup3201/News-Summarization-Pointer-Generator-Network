She has already taken the unprecedented decision to use her mother rather than a nanny to help look after Prince George for the first few precious weeks of his life.

Now The Mail on Sunday can reveal that the Duchess of Cambridge – with her husband’s approval – is setting aside a ‘granny flat’ at the couple’s 21-room Kensington Palace apartment so that Carole Middleton can stay and be on hand.

The lavish apartment is currently undergoing a £1 million renovation and it is understood that a suite  of rooms within it is being created with Carole and her husband Michael in mind.

The Duke, Prince William and Duchess of Cambridge, Catherine with their son, Prince George in the garden of the Middleton family home in Bucklebury, Berkshire, England.

Believed to comprise two bedrooms, a bathroom, a sitting room and a dining area, the suite will allow Kate’s parents to stay at a moment’s notice.

The move suggests that Carole’s influence on the upbringing of the young Prince will continue for some time to come.

The Middletons already own a £1.2 million apartment less than two miles away from Kensington Palace in addition to their £4.5 million pile in Bucklebury, Berkshire. But the rooms at the Palace are set to give them additional privacy and security when they wish to visit their first grandson.

‘Separate living space is being made available for Carole and Michael Middleton within Kensington Palace for when they come to stay,’ said a source familiar  with the new layout of the Palace apartment.

‘The guest area will allow Carole and Michael to be near Kate whenever possible. William is really pleased they will be close by – he really is behind the idea.’

The Duke and Duchess’s apparent willingness to allow Carole to stay at their home is the latest in a series  of ground-breaking moves by the couple, who appear to be determined not let Royal tradition dictate how they raise their family.

After George’s birth at the Lindo Wing of St Mary’s in Paddington last month, the Middletons were the first to visit the hospital, arriving ahead of Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall.

William also insisted on driving his wife and newborn son home from the hospital himself. Days later, Kate moved back to the Middleton family home in Bucklebury, where she received only a few relatives and friends.

Last week, the first official pictures of Prince George were released to the media – they were taken by Michael Middleton rather than a Royal photographer.

Kate and George are scheduled to leave Bucklebury next month when the Palace refurbishment is complete. The Duchess and her mother have taken a keen interest in the decoration of the apartment, overseeing every detail of the interior design. The 21 rooms are arranged over four floors.

‘Kate has obviously been really engaged in the whole thing and she has good taste,’ said the source.

‘The apartment is absolutely  beautiful. It is mainly decorated  in neutral tones but with lovely  textures and furnishings.’

A spokesman for the Duke and Duchess of 
Cambridge played down the significance of the work, saying there is no 'Middleton family annex'.

A source added: 'Of course there is somewhere 
for them to stay when they visit'.

The apartment was previously occupied by Princess Margaret until her death in 2002. The apartment’s extensive overhaul has included the fitting of new wiring, the removal of asbestos and the replacement of a large section of roof.

The £1 million bill is being met  by taxpayers, while the expensive interior redecoration has been paid for privately.

Prince William is due to complete his posting at RAF Valley in Anglesey in mid-September, although he has not announced the exact date he  will leave.

Sources say that the owners of the cottage William and Kate occupied during their time in North Wales are keen to move back in.
