US President Barack Obama has not been invited to Hollywood actor George Clooney's wedding to human rights lawyer Amal Almuddin. 

The actor's publicist dismissed a story in the National Enquirer that President Obama would travel to Italy to attend the star's wedding. 

A spokesman for Clooney told the New York Post: 'The president was not invited. He has more important things to do.'

It is reported that Brad Pitt, left, will act as Best Man for Clooney during the ceremony later this month 

It is understood that Brad Pitt, a newlywed himself, is likely to be best man during the wedding which is understood to be taking place over the coming days. 

Clooney and Ms Alamuddin are expected to get married at his £25 million Lake Como holiday home in Italy.   

It was revealed earlier this summer that Clooney had persuaded the mayor to bring in laws to guarantee his privacy.

Local authorities will hit swimmers with a £450 fine if they are caught in the water within 100 metres of his mansion.

Pedestrians are also to be banned from stopping on the road outside the property.

The laws announced by Laglio Council will stay in operation 24 hours a day until September 30.

Laglio mayor Roberto Pozzi said at the time: ‘We have to guarantee privacy and security for George Clooney and his guests.’

Last Saturday, President Obama attended the wedding of his close friend and long-time chef Sam Cass and MSNBC host Alex Wagner. 

President Obama went to the wedding in Pocantico Hills, just north of New York City with his wife Michelle and daughters Malia and Sasha. 

Mr Cass first started working for the President when he was still a senator living in Chicago. Mr Obama persuaded his friend to join him in the White House. As well as working as a chef, Mr Cass has advised Mrs Obama on nutrition as part of her anti-obesity initiative. 

Mr Obama returned to the White House on Sunday, after the wedding where he continues to deal with the worsening crisis in Syria and Iraq among other things.

Domestically, President Obama is under significant pressure due to the ongoing situation in Ferguson, Missouri. 

He has faced particular criticism over his handling of the ISIS threat.

Meanwhile in an open letter written to the President, the parents of a member of Seal Team Six who was killed in Afghanistan in 2011 attacked Mr Obama over the amount of time he spends playing golf. 

According to the Obama Golf Counter, the President has played 192 rounds since taking office.  

Billy and Karen Vaughn's son Aaron Carson Vaughn was in a Chinook helicopter when it was shot down by insurgents killing all 33 men on board. 

The Seal was engaged in a mission to capture a senior Taliban commander when the aircraft crashed. 

The Vaughn's wrote: 'As Commander-in-Chief, your actions - or lack thereof - Mr President, cost lives.

'As you bumble about in your golf cart, slapping on a happy face and fist-pounding your buddies, your cowardly lack of leadership has left a gaping hole — not only in America’s security — but the security of the entire globe.

'Your message has come across loud and clear, sir: You are not up to this job. You know it. We know it. The world knows it,' the Vaughns wrote in the letter published on World Tribune.

The couple go on to directly ask Mr Obama to resign so that a man or woman 'of courage and substance' can take over and address the 'out-of-control thug fest' happening in Syria and Iraq, where ISIS is attempting to establish a caliphate.

'It’s time for you to step down and allow a true leader to restore our honor and protect our sons and daughters...

'America has always been exceptional. And she will be again. You, Mr President, are a bump in the road,' they wrote.

Billy Vaughn told MailOnline that he has been displeased with the way President Obama has been acting at press conferences.

'I'd like to see him have some passion about anything going on in the world instead of just speaking in a monotone voice like he has a script that has been made up,' Mr Vaughn told MailOnline.
