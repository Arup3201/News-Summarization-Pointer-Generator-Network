A senior Mirror group executive was paying £125-a-time for mobile numbers and voicemail pin codes two years before it was known that the News of the World was relentlessly hacking phones, it emerged today.

Scotland Yard is said to have invoices from private investigators who provided the service, and yesterday the male former Mirror employee accused of employing them refused to comment on the allegations.

The paperwork, seen by the Independent, allegedly shows that the Mirror was regularly using loopholes in the law before 2000 to allow them to hack phones.

Plunge: Shares in Trinity Mirror fell by more than 10 per cent after claims of phone-hacking were lodged against its newspapers and today damning invoices allegedly show an executive paid for phone numbers and voicemail pins

It came as investors in Trinity Mirror called for an investigation as shares in the publisher fell more than 10 per cent after Sven-Goran Eriksson was among four people to lodge claims of alleged phone-hacking against its newspapers.

The High Court legal action is the first in the hacking scandal to be launched against newspapers outside Rupert Murdoch’s News International.

The regimes of three Trinity Mirror editors are implicated in the 
claims, including Piers Morgan who edited the Daily Mirror between 1995 
and 2004.

One major shareholder told the Financial Times: 'We need as much information as possible on this. Any inquiry would be a good thing as that would clear up any concerns about further scandals.'

Another added: 'A year ago we had discussions with Trinity and they claimed they had done an internal investigation. We were never convinced they were asking the right questions. There was a lack of clarity and satisfaction.'

Former England football manager Mr Eriksson has filed a complaint alleging hacking at the Daily Mirror at a time when Piers Morgan was editor.

Mr Morgan, now a CNN talk-show host in the United States, has repeatedly denied any involvement in the practice and rejected claims during a high-profile appearance at the Leveson Inquiry last December.

The three other claimants are Coronation Street actress Shobna Gulati, Abbie Gibson, a former nanny for the Beckham family, and Garry Flitcroft, the former captain of Blackburn Rovers football team, and they involve the Sunday Mirror and The People.

The claims, lodged at the High Court, allege ‘breach of confidence and misuse of private information’ relating to the ‘interception and/or misuse of mobile phone voicemail messages and/or the interception of telephone accounts.’ No further details have been filed.

Media lawyer Mark Lewis, solicitor for the four, said that unlike cases involving the now defunct News of the World - in which a list of alleged victims was found in a notebook - there was no paper trail this time.

He told Sky News: ‘There might not be
a documentary smoking gun, but we will show there is a smoking bullet, 
the consequence of the actions.’

Trinity Mirror said in a statement made through the London stock exchange: ‘We note the allegations made against us by Mark Lewis in today’s papers.

‘We have not yet received any claims nor have we been provided with any substantiation for those claims.

‘As we have previously stated, all our journalists work within the criminal law and the Press Complaints Commission code of conduct.’

News International has settled dozens of phone-hacking claims, paying out tens of millions of pounds to compensate victims.

The Mirror claims come weeks before Lord Justice Leveson - who has been conducting a long-running inquiry into the press - is due to unveil his expected proposals for future regulation.
