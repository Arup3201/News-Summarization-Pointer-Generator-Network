Scientists discover that Sichuan peppers, a popular ingredient in China, contain a chemical that activates touch sensors in the mouth

For some people when it comes to spicy food, the hotter the better, yet for others the mouth numbness and tingling caused by eating chillies is just painful.

But what causes this sensation and why does it vary from person to person?

Previous theories found that chillis contain chemicals that activate hot and cold sensors in the mouth, yet new research from the University College London has discovered another chemical capable of activating the sensors that respond to touch.

Called sanshool, it is found in Sichuan peppers and can access parts of the lips that connect to the area of the brain associated with touch.

Although study co-author Nobuhiro Hagura, a cognitive neuroscientist at the university admits he is unsure exactly how or why it happens.

Sichuan peppers, also known as zanthoxylum piperitum, are found predominantly in China and across the Himalayas.

It is a common ingredient in spicy Chinese cooking and has a reputation for causing tingling lips and making the mouth feel numb.

The authors compare this to the same feeling created by touching a live electrical current.

Chillies are part of the capsicum family of plants that contain chemical compounds called capsaicinoids, such as menthol and, the most prevalent, capsaicin.

When placed inside the mouth, these chemicals activate the parts of the tongue that can determine if food is hot or cold.

The peppers from Sichuan additionally contain a chemical called sanshool, that activates touch sensors.

During tests, Hagura placed Sichuan pepper powder onto the lips of 28 male participants.

Each of the men reported numbing and tingling sensations.

Powder from Sichuan peppers, pictured, was put onto the lips of participants. Their fingers were then vibrated and they were asked whether the tingling on their lips felt faster or slower than the vibrations. Researchers discovered Sichuan peppers created a feeling of 50 vibrations a second - the rate in which nerves sense touch

An American scientist claims that personality might determine whether you like spicy food.

Pennsylvania
State University's research examined the link between peoples' 
personality types and whether they were fans of food packed full of hot 
spices such as chilli.

It found that people who seek adventure and intense sensations like spicy food more than those who avoid risky situations.

Their fingers were then vibrated using a machine and Hagura asked them whether the tingling on their lips felt faster or slower than the movement on their hands.

By changing the vibrational frequency, Hagura was able to determine that the Sichuan peppers created a feeling of about 50 vibrations per second.

This is the rate in which nerves sense light touches on the skin.

Hagura told LiveScience that the findings could be used to discover exactly how taste affects the brain and why it differs from person to person.
