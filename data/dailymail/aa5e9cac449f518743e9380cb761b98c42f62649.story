A bulldog travelled almost two miles on a busy city bus after escaping from its owner and jumping onboard to escape the rain.

The adventurous dog, called Bullseye, made his way onto the number 22 bus in Brighton, East Sussex, after the driver stopped to let on a crowd of passengers.

It was not until the crowded bus reached its destination at Imperial Arcade that people onboard realised the animal was alone.

A lost bulldog travelled almost two miles on a city bus route before passengers realised it had no owner on board.  Adventurous Bullseye sneaked onto the number 22 bus in Brighton, East Sussex

Bus driver Steve Weir was left looking after Bullseye until a dog warden from Brighton and Hove City Council came to rescue him.

With no microchip, the was taken to a vets in Patcham near Brighton, East Sussex, where he was found to be in perfect health.

And a short while later Bullseye, who shares his name with the dog in Charles Dickens’ Oliver, was reunited with his relieved owners.

A member of the public stumbled across a group of children looking for a bulldog in Queen’s Park, Brighton, and informed them of Bullseye’s whereabouts.

Bullseye was finally reunited with his family Scott Maynard and Terrie Nott, and their sons Jake, 10, and Jimmy, 3

The dog's owner - father-of-two Scott Maynard, from Brighton - said: 'I went outside to talk to a neighbour and Bullseye must have escaped.

'It was raining and he hates that so he must have run round the corner and maybe got on the bus to shelter.

'My two boys were devastated when he went and we’re so glad to have him back. It sounds like he had quite an adventure.'

Bullseye was reunited with Scott, his partner Terrie Nott and their boys Jimmy, three, and Jake, ten.

Jake’s friends were searching Queen’s Park when they asked the member of the public if he had seen the dog who then helped to reunite them.

It was not until the busy bus reached its destination at Imperial Arcade that people onboard realised the animal was alone

A spokeswoman for Brighton and Hove Bus Company said the company was delighted Bullseye’s owners had been found.

They added he would be welcomed back onboard anytime, with an offer of free tickets for life.

A spokeswoman for the company said: 'The bus was taken out of service and all the passengers had to be taken off.

'The driver then stayed with the dog for more than an hour while the warden was called.

'Steve said he was a lovely dog and wanted to thank all the passengers for their help in holding on to him as he wasn’t wearing a collar.'
