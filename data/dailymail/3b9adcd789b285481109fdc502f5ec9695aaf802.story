Alan Turing, the Second World War codebreaker, may not have committed suicide

Alan Turing, the Second World War codebreaker widely regarded as the father of modern computing, may not have committed suicide but died as a result of an accident, an academic has claimed.

Evidence gathered after the death of the scientist from cyanide poisoning at the age of 41 in 1954 was 'overlooked' and he could have died as a result of inhaling the poison he used in amateur experiments rather than deliberately ingesting it, according to Professor Jack Copeland.

Professor Copeland, director of the The Turing Archive for the History of Computing and author of a new biography of the academic, spoke as events took place around the country to celebrate the centenary of the under-appreciated scientific genius's birth.

'From the records I have been able to obtain, it seems to me very obvious that the inquest was conducted in a very superficial way,' he said.

'The coroner didn't really investigate the evidence at all, he just jumped to the conclusion that he committed suicide.

'He seems to have been very biased from the statements in newspapers at the time.'

The coroner in Turing's death case ruled he committed suicide 'while the balance of his mind was disturbed', adding: 'In a man of his type, one never knows what his mental processes are going to do next.'

Turing, who was gay, was found guilty of gross indecency with another man in 1952.

To avoid prison, he agreed to receive injections of oestrogen for a year, which were intended to reduce his libido in a process known as 'chemical castration.'

Copeland, a Professor at the University of Canterbury Christchurch in New Zealand, will talk about Turing's death at an event in Oxford tonight.

He said medical evidence suggested Turing died from inhaling cyanide rather than drinking or ingesting it.

He said police reported a strong smell of cyanide coming from Turing's lab, where he used it in amateur experiments.

He called for the inquest to be re-opened.

'It would be a terrific thing to do. I think the nation owes it to Turing, in the Second World War he saved the nation.'

Perhaps best known today for his part in breaking the German Enigma code, Turing was by that time already established as a mathematician of extraordinary capability.

During his time at King's College, Cambridge, he devised the Turing Machine, a mathematical model that went on to become one of the cornerstones of computer science, aged just 22.

And he trended worldwide on Twitter, with Sarah Brown, wife of former prime minister Gordon Brown, writing: 'Happy 100th Birthday Alan Turing.'

In 2009, Mr Brown issued an apology for the treatment of Turing after he was found guilty of gross indecency with another man in 1952.

Mr Brown said at the time: 'The debt of gratitude he is owed makes it all the more horrifying, therefore, that he was treated so inhumanely.'

Today will see scientists and other Turing fans gather in Manchester, Oxford and Cambridge, among other places, to celebrate his work as part of Alan Turing Year.

A spokeswoman for Alan Turing Year, a campaign to celebrate his work during the whole of 2012, said: 'Turing was godfather of computer science and (an) artificial intelligence pioneer, as well as someone who saved literally millions of lives through his codebreaking work.'

Plaques in his honour will be erected in Cambridge, Manchester and at his childhood home, Baston Lodge in St Leonards-on-Sea in East Sussex.

Dr James Grime, from Cambridge University's Millennium Maths Project, who regularly tours schools with an original Enigma machine, said: 'In its purest form, mathematics is the search for truth, and Turing was one of the most important contributors to this search. It's fantastic that his life is being celebrated.'

Former chess prodigy and world champion Garry Kasparov is due to attend Manchester's Alan Turing Centenary Conference on Monday.

A campaign led by Iain Stewart, Conservative MP for Milton Keynes South, is seeking an official pardon for Turing's conviction and there is also a campaign to have him appear on the next issue of the Â£10 note.

The campaign on the Government e-petition website, which had more than 17,500 signatories this afternoon, says: 'Alan Turing is a national hero.

'His contribution to computer science, and hence to the life of the nation and the world, is incalculable. The ripple-effect of his theories on modern life continues to grow, and may never stop.'
