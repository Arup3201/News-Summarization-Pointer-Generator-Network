Arsenal have completed their final training session ahead of their Premier League clash with Chelsea, a fixture they lost 6-0 last season.

Aaron Ramsey and club captain Mikel Arteta will both miss the match through injury but Jack Wilshere trained without any issues as the Gunners prepared to get their revenge for last season's defeat.

Arsene Wenger described that match at Stamford Bridge as one of the lowest points in his career while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain said it was a match he will remember for the rest of his life.

Gunners boss Arsene Wenger lost to Chelsea 6-0 in his 1000th game in charge of Arsenal, and said he wanted revenge against Mourinho's side

Speaking to Arsenal.com, Chamberlain said: 'It was a horrendous day. You would like to say it was one that you forget and don't remember, but I'm sure it's one that I'm going to remember for the rest of my life.

'It was funny because I was always saying that I'd never played at Stamford Bridge. I'd been waiting a few years to play there. It definitely didn't pan out the way I would have liked it to.'

But the 21-year-old showed no signs of fear when talking about heading back to west London, and insisted Arsenal were ready to get their revenge.

He said: 'They are big competition to us so we'll be looking to go there and make a statement early on in the season. I definitely believe we can.'

In the absence of club captain Mikel Arteta, Mathieu Flamini has been playing more regularly for Arsenal but Tomas Rosicky has found his game-time more limited

With the long-term injury to full-back Mathieu Debuchy, Chambers is playing right-back, meaning there is currently no experienced cover at centre-half for Arsenal
