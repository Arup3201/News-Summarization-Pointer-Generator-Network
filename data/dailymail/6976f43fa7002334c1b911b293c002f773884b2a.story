Bank customers will be given more powers to demand a better deal under plans unveiled by Chancellor George Osborne today.

People will be able to switch accounts in just a week if they find a better deal elsewhere.

And the time it takes to transfer money and clear cheques will also be cut as Mr Osborne vowed to take on the 'oligopoly' of a handful of banking giants dominating the market.

Bailing out: George Osborne used a speech at the JP Morgan offices in Bournemouth to say he would let reckless banks go to the wall

In what amounts to the biggest shakeup 
of the banking industry in decades, he also threatened to forcibly break 
up banks that break the rules.

Reckless banks will be allowed to go to the wall so taxpayers never have to bail them out again.

In a speech at the Bournemouth offices of JP Morgan, Mr Osborne said 2013 will be the year when the banking system is 'reset'.

He said he wanted to see banks 'working for their customers, not themselves' as he set out the Government's Banking Reform Bill.

The Chancellor promised to make it easier to switch accounts in just a week, and in future it should be quicker to transfer money and clear a cheque

In a bid to promote better 
competition between banks, from September customers will be able to walk
into their bank and simply demand for their account to be transferred 
to a rival.

Mr Osborne said: 'We’re going to give customers the most powerful weapon of all: choice.'

Crucially, 
the bank will be obliged to transfer a customer’s direct debit payments 
to the new account – ending the weeks of hassle associated with changing
accounts now.

That 
will allow people to shop around and get better interest rates, forcing 
banks to offer better deals for customers to keep them. Consumer 
watchdogs repeatedly complain that new customers are wooed with 
attractive rates of interest, while existing customers are left 
languishing on low rates.

The system of wiring money between banks will also be overhauled, to stop it being dominated by a few big players.

The ring fence between high street banks and high risk investment arms will be 'electrified' so if a bank falls foul of the regulator they could forcibly break up that bank

Mr Osborne said: ‘Why, in the age of instant communication, do small businesses have to wait for several days before they get their money from a credit or debit card payment?  It should be much quicker.

‘Why do cheques take six days to clear? Customers and businesses should be able to move their money round the system much more quickly.

‘Why is it that big banks can move their money around instantly, but when a small business wants to make a payment it takes days?’

The Chancellor said he would ring-fence high street operations from the reckless ‘casino’ investment arms that caused the financial crash. In future no bank will ever again be ‘too big to fail’, he said.

‘When the RBS failed, my predecessor Alistair Darling felt he had no option but to bail the entire thing out,’ he said.

‘Not just the RBS on Britain’s high streets, but the trading positions in Asia, the mortgage books in sub-prime America, the property punts in Dubai.

‘I want to make sure that the next time a Chancellor faces that decision they have a choice – to keep the bank branches going, the cash machines operating, while letting the investment arm fail.

‘No more rewards for failure. No more too big to fail. No more taxpayers forking out for the mistakes of others.’

The Treasury today published a bill to prevent taxpayers ever having to shoulder the burden of bailing out fat cat bankers. This will:

Vow: Mr Osborne said when the RBS failed, his predecessor Alistair Darling felt he had no option but to bail the entire thing out

The legislation published today implements some of the recommendations of the Independent Commission on Banking led by Sir John Vickers. It is the result of a compromise deal between Mr Osborne and Business Secretary Vince Cable.

The bill will also contain plans drawn up by Andrew Tyrie, the Tory chairman of the Commission on Banking Standards, to ‘electrify’ the ring fencing of investment operations.

That means that in future, if an individual bank falls foul of the regulator they could forcibly break up that bank.

The Chancellor said the previous regulatory regime – set up by Gordon Brown and Ed Balls – failed to prevent the last crisis. ‘The fire alarm was ringing, but no one was listening,’ he said. ‘And when the crisis hit, the fire was then so great that the whole economy was sacrificed to put it out. The British people need to know that lessons have been learnt. And they have.’

Mr Osborne acknowledged the level of anger among voters that bankers appear to have got away scot free despite wrecking the economy. But he will also argue that Britain needs a stable and effective banking system to help families and businesses and that bashing the banks will not achieve that.

Royal Bank of Scotland will be forced to slash staff bonuses to fund a multi-million pound fine for rigging interest rates.

The 81 per cent taxpayer-owned bank will this week be docked around £500million for its role in fiddling Libor.

Mr Osborne has told the bank the portion of the fine paid to US regulators, likely to be around £400million, should come from bonuses.

Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers' Association, warned the threat to break up banks this would make it more difficult for banks to raise capital to lend to businesses and would also create uncertainty for investors.

He said: ‘No other major economy is considering moving away from the universal model of banking because it undermines banks' ability to provide all the services businesses need.

‘Above all, what banks and business need is regulatory certainty so that banks can get on with what they want to do, which is help the economy grow.’

Labour claimed the reforms did not go far enough. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: ‘For all the rhetoric and the partial climbdown he has been forced into, George Osborne is still failing to deliver the radical banking reform we need.

'He has refused to repeat Labour's tax on bank bonuses or implement our legislation on pay transparency. And he has failed to get the banks to lend to businesses, with net lending to small firms falling month by month.’

Choice: Customers will be able to switch accounts between banks more quickly

Bank customers will be able to switch accounts with ease under new rules hailed as a revolution for consumers.

Currently, it takes 10 working days to switch an account from one bank to another, but this will be cut down to five in the autumn.

Ministers have rejected calls for customers to keep the same account numbers because they feared IT hold-ups would have made the process much longer and put people off moving their accounts.

As well as making it easier to move accounts, the Government plans to speed up the process of transferring money between accounts held at different banks.

Officials are said to be outraged at the fact that it takes up to three days to pay money from one account into another, and point out that even in relatively poor countries such as South Africa such transfers take no more than 24 hours.

The Chancellor also confirmed plans to encourage new banks to open up, increasing competition on the high street.
