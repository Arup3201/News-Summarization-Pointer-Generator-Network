A judge has warned the warring children of a disgraced former Conservative minister to put stop fighting over their inheritances.

Three of disgraced Lord Antony Lambton's daughters have been taken to the High Court by their brother in a bitter dispute over the former junior defence minister's multi-million-pound estate.

But a judge has told them to stop their 'pointless fight' - which has already used £750,000 in legal costs - saying that the only winners are the lawyers.

Forty years ago Lord Lambton was photographed cavorting in bed with two prostitutes, prompting a huge scandal.

He was forced to resign his post and fled to Italy where he spent the remaining 30 years of his life living in a Tuscan mansion with his mistress, Claire Ward.

When he died aged 84 in 2006 he left his fortune to his only son Edward Lambton, the seventh Earl of Durham, under the British tradition of primogeniture, by which the male heir inherits not only the title but also the entire estate.

In the years after his death, three of his five daughters demanded a chunk of the family fortune because all children have a right to an equal share under Italian law.

The sisters Lady Beatrix Neville, 64, Lady Anne Lambton, 59, and author and former TV presenter Lady Lucinda Lambton, 70, claim they are entitled to a proportion of the £12million estate plus further assets under Italian law.

It was argued at the court in London in 
October that under Italian law, all six of Lord Lambton’s children are 
entitled to one-ninth each of their father’s 'heritable property'.

Their brother Edward who was named as the sole heir to his father's estimated £180million fortune, contests the argument, The Times reported.

Yesterday Mr Justice Etherton ordered Lord Durham to to pay £750,000 of his own and his sisters' legal costs, The Times reported.

The brother was also told he had 28 days to submit a narrower claim of what assets should be protected under English law.

The judge warned the squabbling siblings that only legal experts were profiting from the ongoing case.

They had been in negotiations with their brother and his lawyers and were hoping to receive about £1million each in return for giving up a much larger claim.

But Lord Durham, 52, served a High Court writ in May this year in England to prevent them making claims on his inheritance in Italy.

It was argued at the court in London in October that under Italian law, all six of Lord Lambton’s children are entitled to one-ninth each of their father’s 'heritable property'.

They claim the Italian courts should decide what they receive given that Lord Lambton spent his last years in the country.

Mr Justice Etherton said yesterday that the fight may end up in the Italian courts if the dispute could not be resolved.
