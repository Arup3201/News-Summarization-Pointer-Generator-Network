New pictures show the 32-year-old woman who was swept away to her death by a massive 'sneaker wave' that crashed unexpectedly on a Northern California beach.

Susan Kay Archer died on the same stretch of shore that she walked nearly every day with her boyfriend Sion Tallerico and her dog Trigger.

Mr Tallerico described watching helplessly as his girlfriend was swept out to sea. He was knocked over by the force of the wave, as well, but was battered against rocks on the shore and was not washed away.

'Trigger had gone around the corner and when she went around the corner, I couldn’t see her either. And by the time I was getting around the corner I saw her going out already,' he told ABC News, choking back tears.

Trigger was washed away, as well, but was able to swim back to shore.

The tragedy, which occurred on a beach near Shelter Cove in Humboldt County on Sunday, is the fifth death from a sneaker wave in Northern California this winter.

Archer's body was brought to shore after a 45-minute search by boat and helicopter.

Sneaker waves are disproportionately 
large breakers that can appear without warning.

Familiar: Miss Archer walked the section of beach where she was killed almost every day

Dangerous: Sneaker waves are disproportionately large breakers that suddenly crash against the shore with great force. Three boys are seen fighting for their lives in this video posted on YouTube in 2010

This death is the third incident involving 'sneaker waves' in Northern California this winter. In this picture a couple walk along beach as a helicopter searches for a man lost in the high surf on New Year's Day at the Point Reyes National Seashore

Cheryl Antony, an officer with the Shelter Cove Volunteer Fire Department, told the Eureka Times-Standard Sunday: 'The ocean today was extremely hazardous.

'The waves were about 10 to 15 feet. It was very, very hazardous for them to be out there.'

The Coast Guard said that winter is 'an especially dangerous 
time' on beaches and that sneaker waves can 'catch 
beach goers by surprise.'

'People walking along the beach should not turn their back to the ocean,' was their advice.

On New Year's Day, Charles Quaid, 59, and his wife were walking on the beach near Point Reyes, also in Northern California, when a wave overtook their dog.

Loss: Mary Elena Scott, 57, her son Gregory Kuljian, 16, and her husband Howard Kuljian, 54, were killed after trying to save their dog from the sea. Daughter Olivia, pictured, watched the tragedy unfold

Floral tributes were left at Big Lagoon beach, Northern California, where three members of the Kuljian family drowned in November

The couple went into the water to rescue the pet and Quaid was swept away. His wife and dog made it safely to shore.

Then, on November 24, Olivia Kuljian, 18, watched as her parents and 16-year-old brother were swept to their deaths at Big Lagoon, also in Humboldt County, CA.

Mary Elena Scott, 57, and Howard Gregory
Kuljian, 54, both drowned and their 16-year-old son disappeared while trying to save their dog after it was pulled into the ocean by 8- to 10-foot waves.

Their son, Gregory 
James Kuljian, remains missing after going into the water and he is 
presumed dead. The family's dog climbed out of the sea on its own.
