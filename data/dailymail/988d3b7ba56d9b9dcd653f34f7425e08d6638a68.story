The BBC has been criticised for stereotyping by using a kebab to explain Greece's potential exit from the eurozone.  

The news report explores how Greece might leave the EU - the so-called 'Grexit' - by comparing Greece to a kebab. 

It comes as eurozone finance ministers are gathering in Brussels for make-or-break talks that could see Greece break away from the EU.

Viewers took to Twitter to criticise the BBC for its 'lazy stereotyping' with the kebab to describe Greece 

The report went on to liken the rice inside the kebab as Europe to explain what might happen if Greece quit the EU

In the report by BBC journalist Dougal Shaw, he says: 'To understand this let's think of a more familiar kind of Greek exit. Let's do it with one of the Mediterranean's finest exports, the kebab.

'Imagine it's the Greek economy. It sustains people by providing essentials such as wages and mortgages. It must never stop turning or it will be spoiled.'

The report goes on to describe the rice inside the kebab as Europe.

He says: 'Imagine the rice inside the kebab is the EU. I need to swap it for this other rice, the Drachma. It's a delicate operation so I'm going to deploy these dolmades. 

'They represent capital controls which ban people from moving their money. The dolmades wrap up the rice so no one can take it out the country while I am switching currency.

'The rice is swapped and placed back inside the pitta bread covering ready for consumption to resume.

'The dolmades can now be safely removed.'  

BBC journalist Dougal Shaw likened Europe to 'rice' and Greece to a 'kebab' in a news report 

Viewers took to Twitter to criticise the BBC saying it was stereotyping by using the analogy of the kebab.

Steve Giddens, a journalist, said: 'Grexit explained with a kebab - nice to see the BBC are not succumbing to racial stereotyping.'

University professor and author Stephen Westland wrote on: 'Greek euro exit explained - with kebab. Quite a pathetic analogy. You can do better BBC!'

In 2012, Jeremy Paxman was criticised for comparing Greece's potential EU exit to that of a 'bad kebab' being 'vomited out'.

The former Newsnight presenter was describing Greece's political and financial problems when he used the 'bad kebab' analogy to explain what the rest of the Eurozone may want to do with them. 

A BBC spokesman said tonight: “This is just one of many ways BBC News has covered the Greece debt crisis across television, online and radio. We often use graphics or videos to help break down difficult stories and get key points across.'

Viewers took to Twitter to criticise the news report they described as being 'stereotyping dross' 

University lecturer David Roden said the report explaining Greece and the UK was 'lazy trash' 

It comes as ministers of the 19-member currency union will meet for the third time in 10 days to try and come up with a solution to keep Greece within the EU.  

On Monday night, Greece rejected a plan to extend its €240bn (£178bn) bailout, describing it as 'absurd'.

Greece is likely to run out of money if a deal is not reached before the end of February.

Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has dropped key demands made by his Syriza party in its successful election campaign, agreeing to honour debt obligations and accept continued supervision from bailout lenders and the European Central Bank. 

No country has ever left the EU before and so there is no formal exit process.  

Chancellor George Osborne with Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis - he said a 'common solution' must be found to prevent a full-blown crisis 

Chancellor George Osborne warned today the ongoing stand-off in the eurozone over Greece's debts poses a risk to Britain's economic stability. 

Mr Osborne said that the eurozone countries must find 'a common solution' to ward off a full-blown crisis.

The Chancellor told Sky News: 'What you see now in this stand-off between the eurozone and Greece is the risk of a full-blown crisis which would do real damage to the European economy and is a risk to Britain.

'We need the eurozone to find a common solution and here at home we need to go on working through our economic plan, which has kept us safe.' 

Former chancellor Lord Lamont said the austerity measures forced on Greece had been 'completely counter-productive' and a compromise needed to be found.

He said: 'This is a very serious situation, not just for the eurozone but for Britain too. There needs to be a compromise and more give from Germany.

'The original Greek austerity measures have been completely counter-productive and unsuccessful and need to be completely renegotiated.'
