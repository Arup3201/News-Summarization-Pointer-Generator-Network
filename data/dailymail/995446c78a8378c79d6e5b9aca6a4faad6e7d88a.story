For most men in their mid-20s, the average cab ride involves nothing more than a quick ride home from a night out or a short hop from one side of town to the other.

But it was on one of these unremarkable taxi journeys that intrepid British trio Paul Archer, Leigh Purnell and Johno Ellison decided one of their next trips would be a record breaker.

The three friends set themselves the daunting task of completing the world's longest, most expensive taxi journey, which would take them across the globe past some of the world's most iconic landmarks.

Now 15 months after setting off from London in their faithful £1,500 black diesel cab 'Hannah', the three university friends have triumphantly returned, having finished their record-breaking round the world trip and come back in one piece.

The trio, friends from Birmingham's Aston University, have driven across 50 countries spanning four continents in a marathon adventure which clocked up an £80,000 cab fare.

Along the way Paul, Leigh and Johno had to dig their 20-year-old K-reg cab out of an Arctic snowdrift, evade kidnapping in Pakistan and even scale the highest point ever reached by a taxi when they reached Mount Everest's base camp 5,300 metres above sea level.

They also took in more conventional landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, Sydney Opera House and the Taj Mahal.

Their epic taxi voyage was inevitably not without difficulties, and inevitably the groups were slightly more serious than not having the right change or having to stop by a kebab shop.

During the 43,000 mile adventure the three were arrested in Moscow and even detained by Iranian police, where Paul, 25, was deported as a suspected spy.

They also received a personal pardon from the president of Moldova after being refused entry for failing to produce the correct documents.

after crossing the finish line in Covent Garden today, Guinness World Records are expected to confirm whether they have broken record for the longest journey by taxi.

The record is determined by the distance covered and the total cost of the taxi fare.

The current record is 21,691 miles at a cost of £40,210. It is held by Brits Jeremy Levine and Mark Aylett and Spaniard Carlos Arrese.

The group spent four months travelling from London to Cape Town in 1994.

The black-cab boys hope to trounce the record with their journey - which is set to be more than 43,000 miles, wracking up £80,000 on the cab meter.

Speaking at the finish line, Paul, from Stroud, Gloucs, said the journey had been emotional.

He added: 'We’ve been utterly overwhelmed by the support we’ve been from everyone at home.

'We’re also grateful to the countless number of strangers we’ve encountered who’ve been kind enough to help us on our way.

'This was especially appreciated when adversity struck and we thought, at one point, that our trek would be over.

'We’ve had hairy moments where we were arrested in Moscow, arrested by the Iranian Secret Police, and avoided possible kidnapping on our travels through Pakistan.

'But we’ve taken away with us some awesome memories.'

He added: 'Obviously, we would not have been able to do any of this without Hannah, our beloved and trusty steed.'

The idea for the extraordinary trip came while the boys were in a taxi on the way home from a night out.

Johno, from Leeds, said: 'We thought why not see if we can run up the world’s longest, most expensive taxi journey, and do it all for charity?'

The trio initially planned to raise £20,000 for the British Red Cross by completing a journey from London to Sydney.

But they were £5,000 short of their ultimate goal by the time they had reached their destination.

However smartphone app Get Taxi heard of their problem and pledged them the remaining money.

They also provided them with the fuel, accommodation and GPS tracking system to help them on cirumnavigate the globe.

Neil Fullman, CEO of Get Taxi UK said: 'The lads have much to be proud of.

'And we’re of course thrilled that we have helped them to embark and complete an epic journey that few, if anyone, will ever experience.

'It is great to have played a significant part in helping them to both realise their goal and achieve record-breaking history.'
