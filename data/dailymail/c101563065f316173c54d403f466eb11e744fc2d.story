A funeral had to be delayed after the body of an overweight hospital patient froze solid and got stuck inside the mortuary freezer.

A report said that due to the way the body had frozen hospital staff were unable to remove it from its compartment in time to make the deadline for the funeral service.

Eventually the freezer had to be turned off to allow time for the body to thaw out so that it could be removed and a funeral was held later.

Shocking revelation: A funeral had to be delayed after the body of an overweight hospital patient froze solid and got stuck inside the mortuary freezer atÂ King's College Hospital last year

A King's College Hospital spokesperson said: 'It is vital that deceased patients are treated with dignity and respect when under our care.

'We informed the patient's family when we became aware of this incident, and apologised for any distress caused. We have introduced new procedures to prevent this from happening again, and are undertaking a review of our mortuary facilities.'

The incident at Kings College Hospital, in London, was one of 87 incidents last year recorded by the Human Tissue Authority where there was a mishap with a dead body.

In gruesome blunder uncovered at Warwick Hospital a body was found to contain the brain from another patient which had been put inside the body by mistake after a post mortem examination.

A bewildered funeral director spotted the error as he realised his body's brain had not been removed so the extra organ had to belong to another person. Eventually the mix-up was sorted out and the brain was put back in the body it had been taken from.

At Southampton General Hospital there was an incident where all the spaces in the deep freeze were taken up so a body was put in a body bag and placed in a fridge.

However, staff monitoring the body became concerned as it started to smell and show signs of decomposition.

The report also lists seven occasions last year where the wrong body was released to funeral directors. Fortunately in all the cases the error was eventually spotted and the body returned.

At Eastbourne Hospital, in Sussex, a body was damaged when it fell off a trolley after not having been loaded properly and at West Suffolk Hospital a body released to the funeral directors was found to have two rings missing from it.

There were also reports of problems with mortuary fridges and freezers including one case where the door was accidentally left open which raised the temperature and others where the machines broke down.
