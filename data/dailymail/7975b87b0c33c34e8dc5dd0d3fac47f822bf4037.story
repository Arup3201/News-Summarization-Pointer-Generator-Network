The Foreign Office rejected an invitation to stage a prestigious event in Britain celebrating Press freedom – prompting suspicion the Government feared further criticism over its Royal Charter on Press regulation.

United Nations agency UNESCO asked to hold its World Press Freedom Day, one of the aims of which is ‘to defend the media from attacks on their independence’, in London for the first time this year.

But the Foreign Office said no, saying it had not been given enough notice for the event, which has an expected attendance of 400 to 500 people.

Yesterday a source close to the arrangements said: ‘The British are saying the reasons are logistical but it seems obvious this could not be held in Britain without the problems over the Royal Charter being highlighted internationally.

‘You might well think the Government was afraid it would get a black eye. But they are now facing two black eyes.’

UNESCO is now considering holding the event in Morocco, where Press law prohibits criticism of the monarchy and effectively bars independent coverage of taboo subjects such as the military, national security, religion and sexuality.

Journalists in Morocco, according to watchdog Freedom House, face violence and intimidation, as well as heavy fines and prison sentences, in retribution for their stories.

Press freedom organisations last month urged David Cameron to persuade Parliament to repeal legislation underpinning the Government’s Royal Charter on Press regulation, which was drawn up by politicians in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry into alleged wrongdoing by journalists.

In a letter to the Prime Minister, seven major international bodies – including the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers – described the Charter as ‘incomprehensible arcana’ and warned that ‘autocratic’ foreign leaders were already using it to justify repression.

Newspapers and magazines have refused to sign up to the new regime over fears it would bring to an end 300 years of press freedom.

Instead, the Press is establishing a fully independent body to police its activities, known as the Independent Press Standards Organisation. It will be able to impose fines of up to £1million for serious and systemic wrongdoing.

Word Press Freedom Day is an annual event held every May 3, and includes the awarding of UNESCO’s World Press Freedom Prize for courage in journalism and a seminar. It celebrated its 20th anniversary last year, when it was held in San Jose, Costa Rica.

It is held in a different country each year and has never been held in Britain.

UNESCO says the aims of  World Press Freedom Day are ‘to evaluate Press freedom around the world, to defend the media from attacks on their independence and to pay tribute to journalists who have lost their lives in the exercise of their profession’.

UNESCO approached the Foreign Office having originally planned to hold the event in Indonesia. If it cannot be held in Morocco, the event is likely to be held in Paris, at UNESCO’s headquarters.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We were recently approached by UNESCO after their plans for the event to be hosted in a different country had fallen through. While we are very supportive of the aims of World Press Freedom day, we judged that we would not be able to prepare a suitable set of events to mark the occasion at short notice. The FCO is involved in hosting three major summits this year.’

News of the refusal comes after the industry’s bid to seek a judicial review of the Privy Council’s decision not to approve a rival Royal Charter was rejected – in a one- paragraph ruling which took 17 weeks to arrive.

A secretive committee of four ministers approved a Royal Charter to regulate the Press last year. The Privy Council, which advises the Queen,  rubberstamped the plans after newspapers were denied a  last-ditch legal bid to halt the process.

Four newspaper and magazine industry bodies went to the High Court to seek an injunction to prevent the Privy Council proceeding.

But it was only when the hearing was under way that lawyers for the industry realised that, without warning the papers, the judges had also decided to rule on a separate application for judicial review of the Privy Council’s ‘unfair, irrational and unlawful’ decision not to approve a rival Royal Charter drawn up by  the newspapers.

Lord Justice Richards, sitting with Mr Justice Sales, rejected the application for judicial review and for an injunction.

The two judges retired to consider their verdict for 15 minutes before returning to deliver a ruling that ran to 3,000 words – leaving a strong suspicion it had been prepared in advance.

The industry then applied for permission to appeal against the High Court decision to refuse to grant permission to apply for judicial review.

This time it took 17 weeks for a decision to be made – and when it finally was, it amounted to one paragraph in which Lord Justice Laws refused permission to appeal.
