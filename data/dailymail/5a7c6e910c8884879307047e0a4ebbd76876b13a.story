From super-sized pastel silk to huge sprays of peacock feathers, the hats worn by racegoers arriving for the second day of racing at Glorious Goodwood were elaborate enough to impress even the choosiest of hat connoisseurs.

Day two of the famous race meeting dawned sunny and bright, with racing fans rubbing their hands in glee at the prospect of the Sussex Stakes which this afternoon saw Irish Guineas and St James's Palace 
Stakes winner Kingman beat the hotly tipped Toronado.

But even the prospect of the 'Duel on the Downs' wasn't enough to stop the ladies from vying to be noticed, with yesterday's demure fascinators giving way to huge wide-brimmed hats and ornately decorated cocktail styles.

Others plumped for more classic headwear with wide-brimmed hats in elegant pastel and caramel hues proving particularly popular, as did heavily feathered options.

Although not quite hitting the sartorial heights of Ascot, Glorious Goodwood is catching up in the fashion stakes as more and more racegoers take the opportunity to dress up for the occasion.

Like its Berkshire counterpart, Goodwood also operates a strict dress code that outlaws jeans and shorts and insists that guests keep their shoulders covered and eschew fancy dress.

Instead, the style guide suggests 'jackets and either ties, cravats or polo neck sweaters' for gentlemen and 'smart casual' for ladies, adding that 'due to the terrain and areas of decking at Goodwood, flat shoes are recommended'.

Racegoers certainly appeared to be taking those strictures to heart, with no sign of the wacky hats, skintight frocks and skyscraper heels that characterise other meets, most notably Aintree, although some did brave a day out in high heels.

On the course, racing action got underway with the Goodwood Stakes which was taken by Irish bred gelding Teak, with Irish four-year-old Ray Ward in second place and Long Shadow in third.

Race number two, the Neptune Investment Management Gordon Stakes saw Saudi Arabia's Prince Khalid ibn Abdullah return to winning ways courtesy of three-year-old colt, Snow Sky.

With Kingman, another Prince Khalid steed, taking the 'Duel on the Downs' home this afternoon, today has so far proved to a red letter day for the racing obsessed royal.

Another royal who could also be looking at a win today is the Queen, whose two-year-old filly Touchline is among those lining up for the Markel Insurance Maiden Fillies' Stakes.

Later this week, her Gold Cup winning mare Estimate will also return to the track, just weeks after being caught up in a doping scandal traced to a bag of feed contaminated with morphine.

While Cheltenham is famous for pearls and fur, and Aintree for its colourfully dressed fillies in fake tan and skyscraper heels, Glorious Goodwood's trademark is low key luxury - and flat shoes.

Delicate bejewelled sandals are the most popular with racegoers, as are Sloaney ballet pumps and in the case of some hardened souls, comfortable loafers and deck shoes.

Nevertheless, the meeting isn't short of glamour with plenty of the big, bold, be-plumed hats of the sort seen at Berkshire's Royal Ascot and neat, nipped-in shift dresses reigning supreme in the paddock.

As at Ascot, racegoers have a strict dress code to contend with which insists on smart-casual in all areas and outlaws bare shoulders and any sort of fancy dress.

'Goodwood is famous for being a stylish 
yet relaxed occasion,' continues the style guide, 'and gentlemen are required to wear jackets and 
either ties, cravats or polo neck sweaters in the Richmond Enclosure.

'Linen suits and Panama Hats are traditionally worn by gentlemen. Jeans 
and shorts are not permitted in the Richmond Enclosure. In other 
enclosures dress is smart casual.

'Bare shoulder tops and fancy dress are not 
allowed in any enclosure. Due to the terrain and areas of decking at 
Goodwood flat shoes are recommended.'

Riding to victory: Snow Sky (pink and green), ridden by James Doyle and owned by Saudi's Prince Khalid, gallops home to victory in the Gordon Stakes at Goodwood
