Julianne Moore isn't just the leading nominees for best actress at this year's Oscars - she's also helping to design the backstage green room.

Architectural Digest, which has been the official sponsor of the luxurious space since 2003, announced today that the Still Alice star will consult on the room's look and help choose furniture and decor for the celebrity enclave.

The 54-year-old actress, who is nominated in her category alongside the likes of Reese Witherspoon and Rosamund Pike, will use her own experience of 'what it's like to be backstage on Oscar night' in order to ensure that the stars-only hangout comes complete with every comfort she and her fellow celebrities might need.

It is not the first time that Ms Moore has worked alongside the magazine; in 2012, the garden of her home in New York City's West Village was featured in the publication, with writer Simon Doonan waxing lyrical about the actress' design talents.

'Had she not become an actress, Julianne Moore could definitely have been a decorator, and a successful one at that,' he wrote. 

'Furniture, design, construction, renovation, and all manner of zhuzh - these are her obsessions.'  

Last year, the prestigious honor of decorating the green room was given to Academy Award winner Susan Sarandon, who worked alongside renowned architect David Rockwell in order to transform the spaceinto a five star retreat for every famous face who stepped out on the stage throughout the night, be it to collect an award, or to present one.

Ms Sarandon, 68, curated a digital collection of Oscars-themed images, which were showcased in the space throughout the ceremony.

This year's room will see Ms Moore collaborating with Los Angeles-based design collective Commune, however little else is known about what they have planned for the design. 

No doubt the multi-talented mother-of-two is hoping that she will get the opportunity to enjoy a celebration inside the space; having snagged both a Golden Globe and a Critics Choice Award for her role in drama Still Alice, Ms Moore is, unsurprisingly, the firm favorite to be awarded the Best Actress gong at this year's ceremony.

It is the fifth time that Ms Moore has been nominated for an Academy Award, having been pipped to the post in both the Best Actress and the Best Supporting Actress categories in 2002. 

But despite her seemingly unstoppable wins at this season's award ceremonies, the actress admitted that she was stunned to have received another Oscar nod.

'Thank u everyone for the congratulations!' she tweeted just minutes after she was named by Chris Pine and Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs in Beverly Hills. 'I am so happy I can barely breathe #makingmyselfdizzy #AcademyAwards'
