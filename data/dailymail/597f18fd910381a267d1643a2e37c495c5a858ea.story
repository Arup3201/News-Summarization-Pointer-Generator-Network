A beautiful mist settled on large parts of the UK this morning ahead of another warm and dry day on which temperatures could reach highs of 22C.

Hazy clouds could be seen drifting through farmland in Somerset while also working their way across Doncaster Racecourse in South Yorkshire and Gleneagles Golf Course ahead of an enthralling second day at the Ryder Cup.

And as the fog burns off the Met Office predict the uncharacteristically pleasant September weather will continue - spelling good news for racing and golf fans and anyone else enjoying the outdoors over the weekend.

A spokesman for the Met Office said: 'Today will be mostly dry and cloudy for everybody with a few sunny intervals. There could be a few specks of rain in Scotland and Northern Ireland but nothing too heavy.

'Tomorrow will be mostly dry with a cloudy start and more sunny intervals but there may well be some rain again in Northern Ireland and western Scotland, which could reach the Ryder Cup. 

'Today the maximum temperatures expected will be around 22C in central London with Scotland a few degrees cooler.

'Tomorrow it is expected to be a little warmer, with temperatures creeping up to 23C, again in London. The best of the weekend sunshine is likely to be enjoyed by the south east of the UK. 

'Temperatures in Scotland could be between 17C and 20C. That's five degrees higher than normal.

'Temperatures at the start of next week will remain in the low teen and high twenties in most towns and cities, with 17C or 18C possible in Scotland.' 

Forecasters have also said that Britain could also enjoy temperatures of 21C in the first days of October - eight degrees hotter than the monthly average. 

The Met Office spokesman added: 'The average temperature for England in October is 13.8C, but towards the end of next week we are predicting temperatures to be between 21-22C in the south.

'That's a huge difference. And Glasgow, which has an average October temperature of 11.5C could see temperatures of up to 19C.'
