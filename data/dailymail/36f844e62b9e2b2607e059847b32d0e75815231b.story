If he navigates the next stretch of uncharted territory as adroitly as he did the treacherous links of Royal Aberdeen, Justin Rose will take some stopping.

Until Sunday, the Englishman had never won back-to-back tournaments. After following up his win at Tiger Woods’ very own Quicken Loans National by winning the Scottish Open, his sights are now set on a remarkable treble.

He heads to Hoylake for The Open in the best form of his life, his links skills honed to near-perfection during a closing 65.

On a roll: Justin Rose won consecutive tournaments for the first time in his career

Nicely placed: The English golfer will be among the favourites for The Open at Hoylake

Rose, who 
jumps to third in the world after pocketing £500,000 in Scotland’s north
 east, said: ‘I couldn’t have scripted this better. I’ve never won two 
in a row and I’ve certainly never won three in a row. So this is 
uncharted territory.

‘But I 
don’t feel like these two wins have taken too much out of me. I haven’t 
taken my eye off the ball. I won’t be celebrating too much. In the past,
 I feel like I’ve enjoyed my wins a little too much. So I will try to 
stay level-headed. By tomorrow my mind will be back on the game.’

Rose 
compared the pressure on him to his breakthrough season of 2010, when he
 headed to  The Open on the back of two  US PGA Tour wins, but he said: 
‘I’ve been playing well for four or five years now and I’m a lot more 
comfortable with the expectations. I trust my game more.’

He left 
his playing partner, Scotland’s Marc Warren, open-mouthed in wonder at 
his skills. ‘Obviously I didn’t want to be on the end of it,’ said the 
33-year-old. ‘But it was a joy to watch.’

Despite 
putting the local hero to the sword, Rose was roared on by the local 
galleries, many of whom hope to be cheering him on in Team Europe 
colours at  Gleneagles later this year. ‘The next time I will be in 
Scotland will be for the Ryder Cup,’ he told them in his victory speech.
 ‘So hopefully you will be loud and proud.’

Rose went 
into Sunday tied with Warren at 10 under par. But he edged ahead with 
birdies on the second and third — and never looked back at the mayhem 
unfolding beneath him.

There were things happening on every corner of the course under the grey drizzle.

Kristoffer
 Broberg made an unlikely charge, then Scott Jamieson followed by 
getting within touching distance of  double digits under par.

Both came up short but, along with young Tyrrell Hatton, claimed places in The Open as consolation.

Just when 
you thought it was safe, defending champion Phil Mickelson put in a 
phenomenal push that just petered out towards the end.

Above the 
melee, though, Rose looked like he was in a world of his own, reaching 
the turn in 31 strokes. No-one was able to match his pace and, at the 
end of four days of extremes, he stood two shots clear of Broberg. Now 
can he pull off a third straight win?

Some of 
those who competed here will fancy themselves to stop Rose, with 
defending Open  champion Mickelson believing he’s played himself into 
form. After shooting 65, the American insisted he’d be relaxed going to 
Hoylake.

‘There is a
 fraction of the pressure I felt before at Open Championships,’ he said.
 ‘Because, once you’ve already won it, once you’ve held the Claret Jug 
and have one, it just feels different. You don’t feel like you have to 
fight it and have to force it.’

Rory McIlroy finished with a 67, his third round under par this week — the odd one out being Friday’s horrific 78.

‘I see enough good signs in my game to give me confidence for next week,’ he insisted.

‘I am in 
good form. I had three good rounds here. If I could just string a fourth
 round in there it would be great and, going into next week, that is 
what I am going to try and do — play four solid rounds of golf and see 
where that leaves me.’
