Careering down a hillside in pursuit of a rolling wheel of cheese, the daredevils of Cooper’s Hill are used to flying in the face of the health and safety brigade.

But this year they have been stopped in their tracks after police stepped in and threatened the 86-year-old woman who provides the showpiece cheese for the centuries-old event.

For 25 years, Diana Smart has provided hand-made 7lb rounds of Double Gloucester to be chased by enthusiastic participants in the annual cheese rolling.

Big cheese: Diana Smart, 86, from Gloucester makes the cheese that is chased down Coopers Hill in Gloucestershire by thrill-seekers. Police have told her not to do it this year

But yesterday it emerged the octogenarian received a ‘heavy-handed’ visit from three police officers, who advised her to cease her involvement.

They visited her farm in Churcham, Gloucestershire, and told her she could be personally liable for any injuries suffered by those taking part.

The unique event has been held for over 200 years on the Whitsun Bank Holiday in May and has been known to attract thousands of ‘chasers’ and onlookers.

It involves competitors speeding after the 12-inch cheese down a hill in Brockworth, Gloucestershire. The first to the bottom wins the cheese.

Mrs Smart, who sells her wares to luxury grocers Fortnum and Mason, has been providing the cheese since 1988, but says she has been forbidden from doing so for this year’s roll on Monday.

She said: ‘We are not allowed to give
 them cheese this year. The police came to my farm and said it could 
cause us an enormous amount of damages.

‘I just have to take it as they have 
said. We cannot do anything about it. It’s crackers the fact that the 
police came round and warned me not to give the event some cheese.’

She continued: ‘I like doing it. It’s always brought me such joy and a smile. The police were so heavy-handed.

‘They threatened me, saying I would 
be wholly responsible if anyone got injured. I’m 86, I don’t have the 
will or the cash to fight any lawsuits. It’s crazy.

Cheese charge: Daredevils chase the cheese at Coopers Hill, Gloucestershire as part of the historic event

‘It’s such a shame – the police are using scare tactics on businesses because they can’t break the will of the locals.’

The annual cheese rolling consists of
 five races – three for men, one for women, and a safer uphill chase for
 children. Injuries suffered at the event have included broken arms, 
legs and backs.

Following health and safety fears 
2009 was the last official cheese rolling event – but it is still put on
 unofficially by a group of ‘rebel rollers’ from Brockworth, who hold 
informal races without proper medical cover or insurance.

And organisers say they will continue to defy any bid to stop the race happening. One said yesterday: ‘It’s outrageous.

Completely unbelievable. You cannot 
stop someone selling cheese. If they try to stop us, we will use 
something else or get some cheese elsewhere.’

A Gloucestershire police spokesman 
confirmed: ‘Advice has been given to all those who have participated in 
any planning of an unofficial cheese rolling event this coming bank 
holiday.’
