One couple's romantic moment in the sea ended in agony when their genitals became stuck together.

Two amorous Italians decided to take advantage of a sunny day on an almost-deserted beach by heading into the sea together.

Unable to control themselves, they engaged in a passionate embrace, according to the Italian newspaper The Local.

But their lovemaking came to an embarrassing end when the man was unable to extract himself from the woman due to suction, it was reported.

They were forced to remain in the water until they manage to flag down a woman walking past, who offered them a towel to cover their tangled bodies as they struggled back to shore.

A doctor was called to the beach at Porto San Giorgio, Italy, but the case was so severe the couple were taken to the emergency room at a local hospital.

There, the couple were set free after the woman was given an injection commonly used to dilate the uterus of pregnant women.

It's thought that the couple may have suffered from the rare occurrence 'penis captivus' in which the muscles of the vagina clamp down on the penis much more firmly than usual.

When the penis is in the vagina it becomes increasingly engorged,  Dr John Dean, a UK-based sexual physician, told the BBC.

He said: 'The muscles of the woman's pelvic floor contract rhythmically at orgasm. While those muscles contract the penis becomes stuck and further engorged.' 

Finally the vaginal muscles relax, the blood flows out of the penis and the man can withdraw.

He said that over the years, several of his patients have discussed their experience of getting 'stuck'  - more out of curiosity than because it was a problem, he added.

The news comes after this year a half-naked woman had to be rescued by firefighters from the bottom of a well after falling in while having sex near a Spanish park.

The 21-year-old was making love with her partner when the cover of the waterwheel well shaft came loose, sending her plummeting 15m into the water below.

But rather than trying to rescue his girlfriend, the man pulled up his trousers in a panic and fled the scene.
