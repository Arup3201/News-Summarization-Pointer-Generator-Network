A shopper looks at one of the designer dresses donated to Naomi House Children's Hospice in Winchester

Cash-strapped brides have descended on a charity shop to snap up designer wedding dresses after a surprise donation worth £40,000. 

The 35 gowns - worth up to £2,000 each - are being sold at a fraction of their usual prices in aid of the Naomi House Children's Hospice in Winchester, Hants.

A generous bridal store owner handed over the expensive frocks as her business closed.

Andrea Balmer, shop manager at the Naomi House store, couldn't believe it when the woman rang up to ask if they would take in the stock.

Mrs Balmer, 46, said: 'I got a call out of the blue from the owner of a bridal store asking if we'd be interested in her 35 old display dresses.

'After my jaw hit the floor, I said "Yes please!" She brought the dresses in later, wrapped up in old curtains and they were all absolutely stunning.

'It's an extraordinary donation - all the dresses are worth more than £1,000 each and the dearest sells for £2,000.

'The day we put them out on display, customers were beating the door down to get in.

'Young ladies have been flocking here to
 try the dresses on - these girls are experts who have been thinking 
about wedding outfits since they were 10.

'They recognise all the designer names, which were quite new to me.

'One gentleman told me you have to book up three months in advance just for an appointment with a company that made one of the dresses.

'We sold it for £300.

'Some women come in thinking they know exactly what they are looking for in a dress and leave with something completely different.

'But they all know they're getting a bargain as we're able to sell them for 100 - £400.

'It's fabulous for the charity and has lifted everybody's spirits in the shop.'

Internationally renowned brands David Fielden, San Patrick and Pronovias are among the famous names on offer at the shop.

Mrs Balmer's team of 20 shop staff have sold six so far, raising £1,800 for children with life-limiting illnesses.

The shop also has 11 flower girl dresses based on the design at Prince William and Kate's wedding and exquisite bridal shoes.

At normal prices they would cost £2,500 in total, but each is on sale for just 50 pounds.

Mrs Balmer, who has two children, added: 'We can't help having a look when the customers are trying the dresses on and get so excited.

'One lady was shopping for dresses with her step mother and picked an absolutely beautiful gown - it looked fabulous.

'When her step-mum suddenly said "I'll pay for it" we were all crying - the girl said she could never have been able to afford a dress of that calibre.

'We're not professional wedding dress sellers but I can see why people do it now, it's a very happy, special process to be a part of.

'This means so much to our charity and now word is spreading, more donations are coming in thick and fast.

'I think when people see nice items in the shop window they're more willing to part with their old things.

'They know you'll get a good price and give it to a great cause.'

A mystery donor dropped off around 30 designer hats from labels Mulberry, Burberry, Harrods and Jaeger complete with price tags of up to £200.

The anonymous woman pulled up outside the shop in her car as it was closing up and handed some boxes in, Mrs Balmer said.

She added: 'I was speechless when I opened the box up - these are proper Ascot hats in the most amazing, colourful fabrics.

'They're wonderful.'

She is asking £20 to £50 per hat, and has sold two already.
