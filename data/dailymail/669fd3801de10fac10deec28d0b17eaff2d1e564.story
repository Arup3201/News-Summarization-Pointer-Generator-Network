A primary school teacher accused of restraining a pupil for five minutes by covering him with a giant beanbag and sitting on top of it has been cleared of misconduct.

Philip Meredith, 44, was said to have trapped the youngster under a beanbag the size of a double bed at Ty Sign Primary School in Risca, Wales, while the pupil shouted ‘get off, get off’, a professional conduct committee hearing was told.

Speaking after the hearing's conclusion today, the father-of-two said he was 'absolutely delighted' with the result as 'the past three years have been like a living hell'.

Ellen Sheldon, a teaching assistant working in Mr Meredith’s classroom at the time of the alleged incident, told the hearing how she could see the child – named only as ‘Pupil A’ - ‘kicking’ as he tried to free himself. 

She reported the incident - which allegedly happened on November 17, 2011 - and the following month Mr Meredith was suspended. He was later dismissed. 

Appearing before a General Teaching Council for Wales (GTCW) professional conduct committee in Cardiff, Mr Meredith denied the accusation and was today cleared of eight charges of misconduct.

He also denied bullying and rough-handling other pupils - allegations brought forward by teaching assistants at the primary school.

It was alleged that he shouted at Pupil A and spoke 'overly loudly' to him, when it was not necessary or appropriate to do so. 

He denied the claim but admitted he has a 'naturally loud voice'. 

After being cleared of eight charges of misconduct while teaching at Ty Sign Primary School in Risca, Wales (above), Mr Meredith said: 'The past three years have been like a living hell'

It was also alleged that he held a second child - Pupil B - by the front of his shirt and held him on the floor with his face against the carpet.

Speaking during the hearing, Mr Meredith said: 'I recognise that all these allegations are very, very serious and I also recognise that I did not do them.'

Teaching assistant Ellen Sheldon had told the hearing that she saw the beanbag incident saying: 'There was a fight and Pupil A was put in a restraint by Mr Meredith.

'I didn't see how he got under the bag. I could see his feet kicking and he was shouting 'get off, get off'.

‘I would estimate he was under the bean bag for four to five minutes.’

Sobbing throughout her evidence she told the panel: ‘I’ve never had to deal with anything like this on my life and I never want to deal with it again. It’s made me feel ill.’ 

After clearing the teacher of all charges, hearing chairman Gareth Roberts said: 'The facts have not been proven on the balance of probabilities.'

Mr Meredith, from Merthyr Tydfil, said afterwards: 'I'm absolutely delighted and relieved to have been fully vindicated of all the unfair allegations against me.

'The past three years have been like a living hell where I have been kept from a career which has been my life. I sincerely hope now to be able to return to teaching.'
