Atif Ali had to undergo a seven-hour surgery to save his life after he was shot on May 20 last year

A man accused of conspiring to murder an accountant today told a jury that the plan was only to injure the man - and used cockney rhyming slang to explain what happened.

Bernard Pillay, from London, said that he had been told about the plan to injure accountant Atif Ali by businessman Shahzad Mahroof, who said he wanted to put Mr Ali in hospital with a broken leg.

Pillay, 41, told a jury at Luton Crown Court how Mahroof had approached him with the idea, saying that he wanted someone to break Mr Ali's legs, who was allegedly his rival in a love triangle.

Recounting the conversation, Pillay said that Mahroof suggested that it be done using a car or a baseball bat.

But Pillay admitted that he proposed shooting the Mr Ali instead, saying that it was an 'efficient way of putting him in hospital'. He used cockney rhyming slang to explain the exchange.

He said: '[Mahroof] wasn’t too specific about how he wanted this done. I said "All this faffing about. Why don’t you just put one in his scotch"?'

Asked what scotch meant, he replied 'Scotch egg - leg. It was a far more easier way than the complicated 
ways he was suggesting.'

Later in his testimony he referred to the 'jam jar', meaning car, and the 'April', which he explained meant 'April fool - tool'.

Pillay said he first discussed the plan with Mr Mahroof during a boxing match at Bethnal Green’s York Hall in East London in April last year.

Pillay denies conspiring to murder 28-year-old Mr Ali on May 20 last year.

It is alleged Pillay shot Mr Ali in his left thigh with a single shot from a double-barrelled shotgun at close range after deliberately driving into the back of Mr Ali's car as he travelled to work.

When Mr Ali got out to inspect the damage, it is claimed by the prosecution that Pillay jumped out of the Mondeo with the sawn-off shotgun and shot Mr Ali.

Mr Ali survived after undergoing a seven-hour operation at Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge.

It is alleged by the prosecution that Shahzad Mahroof and the victim were part of a love triangle in competition for the hand of a young Luton woman, whom the Mr Ali was engaged to.

The jury have heard that, as the animosity between the two men deepened, Mahroof wanted his rival out of the way so he could pursue a relationship with her.

Mahroof, from Luton and Pillay, from Uxbridge, west London along with four other men on trial, plead not guilty to conspiracy to murder Mr Ali.

They have both pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiring to commit grievous bodily harm, but the prosecution claim they are guilty of conspiring to murder Mr Ali.

Giving evidence, Pillay said he was known for 'little bits of violence' and, as a result, got to hear about Mahroof’s 'problem'.

He told the jury that Mr Mahroof 'had a problem' with a 'firm that was running around Luton'.

He said: 'Part of this little ruffian firm needed hurting and he wanted a hospital jobby.'

Pillay told the court there could be a 'nice few quid' in it for him, which he explained meant 'thousands'.

Commenting on ways  Mahroof was suggesting his rival’s legs should be broken, which was a baseball bat attack and running him over, Pillay said: 'I was thinking that sort of stuff can get messy'.

He said shooting the man in the leg was a 'quick, efficient way of putting him in hospital.'

Continuing his evidence, he said there were further discussions with Mahroof over the phone about getting hold of a 'jam jar', meaning a car, for the job.

Pillay said he left it to a friend to source the weapon to be used.

He said: 'I left him to get the April - that was his department.'

Asked what April meant, he told the court it was short for 'April Fool - tool'.

Earlier, Mahroof told the jury he believed Mr Ali had been organising a plan for him to be attacked.

He said he had no reason to want the accountant dead and told Pillay: 'Do what you have to do as long as his leg is broken.'

Mahroof, of Luton, Pillay, 41, from Uxbridge, Matthew McCafferty, 23, from Flitwick, Mark O’Neil, 41, from Hayes, Middlesex, Mahboob Baig, 31, from Luton and Sajed Hussain, 31, from Luton, all plead not guilty to conspiring to murder Mr Ali on May 20 last year.

Mr Pillay, say the prosecution, was the gunman that morning, Mr McCafferty is alleged to have supplied the shotgun.

Mr O’Neil, is said to have been given the job of driving Mr Pillay up to Luton to carry out the shooting and Mr Baig is said to have been 'co-ordinating' the shooting. Mr Hussain’s role is said to have been as a 'spotter'. Mr McCafferty, Mr Baig, Mr O’Neil and Mr Hussain also deny conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm on Mr Ali.

The jury have been told Mahroof and Pillay have pleaded guilty to this charge.

Mahroof also denies making a threat to kill Mr Ali, and Mr McCafferty denies a charge of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life, having a firearm with intent and possessing a prohibited firearm.

The trial continues.
