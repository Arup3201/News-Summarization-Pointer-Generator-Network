A badger gnawing its way out of a shed, a snail munching through carpet and a baby vomiting all over a laptop.

They are among the bizarre insurance claims made to provider RIAS, as they reveal the top 10 weirdest reasons for claiming on a policy.

In one crazy claim, a snail devoured £78-worth of carpet in the home of a 73-year-old man from Preston in Lancashire.

Insurance provider RIAS has published its top 10 list of most bizarre claims in the last year. Among them was a man who claimed after a badger damaged his shed, gnawing its way out after becoming trapped inside

A 71-year-old woman from Bath in Somerset, also received a pay out after locking a badger in her shed, which then ate a hole in the wall to escape.

One family received a whopping £8,000 payout after a pigeon flew down their chimney and damaged the carpet, ornaments and sofas.

A seven-month-old puppy in Cardiff caused £953 of damage when he pinched a bottle of oil from the kitchen, dragged it to the living room and chewed it while sitting on the couch.

In Exeter, Devon, a squirrel smashed a window of an 86-year-old woman after it became stuck in her garage.

But animals weren't the only things behind bizarre claims - one 62-year-old received £469 after a gust of wind blew his glasses off his face and were run over by a car.

In another settled claim, a man received a new £437 laptop after holding up his baby grandson to show a friend on Skype - who then vomited all over the computer

A proud grandfather in Guildford, Essex, received a new £437 laptop after holding up his baby grandson to show a friend on Skype. The baby then vomited all over the computer.

The list of bizarre insurance claims was compiled by specialist insurance provider RIAS from the almost 400,000 successful cases in 2012-13.

Peter Corfield, Managing Director at RIAS said: 'While we go out of our way to ensure that our homes and gardens are safe and secure, sometimes it's the most unlikely events that can end up causing real damage.

'Not all claims are straightforward and sometimes we do see some bizarre scenarios.

'But, saying that, babies and animals are often the culprits.'
