Apple is believed to have reduced its orders for memory chips for its new iPhone from its main supplier and competitor Samsung.

The claim, reported by Reuters, suggests that Apple has been cutting back its orders from Samsung as it seeks to 
diversify its memory chip supply lines, although the South Korean firm 
remains on the list of initial suppliers for the new iPhone.

Apple and Samsung have gone from friendly co-partners to arch-rivals, following Apple's claims, upheld by the courts in the U.S., that the Galaxy range of smartphone's copied the iPhone's classic lines.

iPhone vs Galaxy: Samsung build a range of components for both Apple and its own devices - but Apple 'is seeking to stop being so reliant on Samsung'

South Korea's Samsung is a core 
Apple supplier, producing micro processors, flat screens and memory 
chips - both dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips and NAND memory 
chips - for the iPhone, iPad and iPod.

The Korea Economic Daily, citing an
unnamed industry source, reported on Friday that Apple had dropped 
Samsung from the list of memory chip suppliers for the first batch of 
the new iPhone, the iPhone 5, which is widely expected to be unveiled 
next Wednesday.

The source declined to be named because the negotiations are confidential.

The report said Apple instead picked Japan's Toshiba 
Corp, Elpida Memory and Korea's SK Hynix to supply DRAM and NAND chips.

The source said: 'Samsung is still 
on the list of initial memory chip suppliers (for new iPhones).

'But 
Apple orders have been trending down and Samsung is making up for the 
reduced order from others, notably Samsung's handset business'.

Samsung's handset business, led by 
robust sales of its flagship Galaxy line of products, has become the 
most important earnings pillar, bringing in around two-thirds of 
Samsung's overall profit, and is driving sales of component - from 
memory chips to micro processors and displays.

Samsung, the world's top smartphone
maker, said on Thursday that sales of its Galaxy S III smartphones 
topped 20 million since its late-May debut.

The source denied market 
speculation that the reduced orders from Apple were prompted by a 
souring relationship between the two companies, which are locked in 
global patent disputes, and said Apple had already been looking to widen
its supply chain.

Bernstein 
analysts estimate Apple's purchases of mobile DRAM and NAND chips from 
Samsung have fallen significantly and now only account for around 2.5 
percent of Samsung's 2012 earnings.
