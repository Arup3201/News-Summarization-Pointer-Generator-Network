A British mormon father-of-six has been killed by a bee sting despite always carrying an EpiPen with him in the knowledge that he was severely allergic. 

Luke Calcraft, 46, died in St. Luke's University Hospital in Fountain Hill, Pennsylvania, on August 1 after falling ill following a severe reaction to the insect's sting.

He had moved from Chelmsford, Essex, to Pennsylvania in 2012 after landing a dream job as president of the medical systems group Olympus Corp. 

Allergic reaction: Luke Calcraft (pictured above with wife Natasha) died on August 1 after being stung by a bee 

It is understood Mr Calcraft, who formerly worked in Southend, Essex, was allergic to insect bites and carried an EpiPen -  but he still could not be saved. 

He was an active member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and leaves behind a wife, Natasha, and six children - Tom, Sam, Joel, Sarah, Rhonin and Arija.

The high-flying employee had previously been responsible for the company's medical and microscopy businesses in Europe, Russia, the Middle East and Africa.

Peter Holmes, who worked with Mr Calcraft between 2003 and 2012, has described his death as tragic.

The 62-year-old, from Shoebury, Essex, said: 'What has happened is a terrible tragedy. Everybody is shocked.

'I am still in touch with people I worked with and we all can't believe what has happened. It's hit us all hard

'He was a very popular man and people felt good about having him around. I will remember him for being very good at his job. He was a decision maker, but also very diplomatic. 

Tragic: The British businessman moved to Pennsylvania in 2012 after landing a dream job as president of the medical systems group Olympus Corp.

'He loved the company and gave so much to the business and to Southend.' 

He added: 'He was an altruistic character. He worked hard trying to persuade various authorities to do certain things for the benefit of residents' safety. 

'A lot of his spare time was spent working on road safety. It was something he was very passionate about and gave a lot of his time to it.'

Mr Calcraft had been employed with Olympus for 24 years and had worked his way up from the Southend branch to president of the medical systems group of Olympus in America. 

A spokesperson for Olympus in America said: 'We are deeply saddened by the sudden and unexpected loss of our friend and colleague, Luke Calcraft, president of the Medical Systems Group at Olympus Corporation of the Americas.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with Luke's family and friends.' 

Mr Calcraft's funeral was held at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Kutztown on August 7.
