Manuel Pellegrini has been named the Premier League Manager of the Month for December after the Chilean guided Manchester City to five wins last month.

The Premier League champions were unbeaten in the month of December and claimed 16 points from a possible 18 in the league.

It was a run of form that helped City claw back eight-point deficit on league-leaders Chelsea to end 2014 within touching distance of the top of the table.

Sunderland 1-4 Manchester City

Manchester City 1-0 Everton

Leicester 0-1 Manchester City

Manchester City 3-0 Crystal Palace

West Brom 1-3 Manchester City

Manchester City 2-2 Burnley 

Manchester City recorded away wins against Sunderland, Leicester and West Brom and beat Everton and Crystal Palace at the Etihad.

The only blot on Pellegrini's copybook was a 2-2 home draw with relegation candidates Burnley after City threw away a two-goal lead in the final game of the year.

That run of form is even more impressive considering Pellegrini had to deal with a spate of injuries that decimated his forward line, including an injury to star striker Sergio Aguero at the start of the month.

Edin Dzeko and Steven Jovetic also spent much of the month injured but City still managed to score 14 goals in just six Premier League matches matches.

It is the third time Pellegrini has won the award during his 18-month spell in the Premier League, winning it for consecutive months in December 2013 and January 2014.

QPR striker Charlie Austin won the player of the month for December.
