Lukasz Fabianski revealed Swansea's players were in shock after striker Bafetimbi Gomis collapsed against Tottenham and admitted the incident had scared him.

The French forward lost consciousness during the match at White Hart Lane on Wednesday and while Gomis made a full recovery Fabianski insisted it had left the player shaken.  

'From the moment when I saw something was wrong it was when Bafe was already on the floor and you could feel that everyone was in kind of shock,' said Fabianski after the match. 'But from what I heard he's OK now so hopefully everything is OK.'

When asked if seeing his team-mate like that scared him, Fabianski replied: 'Obviously, it was a shocking moment, especially because it's the same ground where something similar happened before, you just don't want the same thing to happen. Those kind of things go through your mind.' 

Swans midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson added: 'I asked the doctor and he said he was OK and hopefully would recover. Hopefully he will be back with us soon.

'It's never nice to see someone go down like that. We have a good medical team and they came on to the pitch very quickly.

'It will be really nice to have him back, he's an important player for us.'

Shocking as it was, it wasn't the first time Gomis has experienced such a collapse. 

In 2009, Gomis lost consciousness in both a pre-season friendly match with Lyon and during a training session with the French national team. 

He also lost collapsed during a match between Lyon and Monaco in 2010, after which he said: ‘I had an incident early in the game. I often do early in the season. I immediately felt good after that. I think it was related to stress and the desire to resume the season.’

A vasovagal syncope, which is what Bafetimbi Gomis suffered on Wednesday night, is caused by a sudden decrease in blood pressure or heart-rate, triggered by emotional or physical factors.

Reduced blood flow to the brain makes a person faint. It can be prompted by extreme exertion or anxiety.

On the physical side, there are numerous tests that can be done when a player has a medical and it appears Swansea knew all about Gomis’s history.

They will have checked the flow through his blood vessels under exercise stress, though emotional triggers are harder to quantify.

It is a rare condition for a professional sportsman and is more common in older people. It is not something I have encountered in any other footballer.

Thankfully, it is not an especially dangerous condition in isolation. The risks are low beyond what happens when you fall. You could hit your head or suffer trauma damage to another part of the body on landing.

Often there is a stimulus that the person will recognise and they can act, by sitting down.

Most sufferers feel fine in a matter of moments.
