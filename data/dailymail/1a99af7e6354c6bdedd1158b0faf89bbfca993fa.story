A Conservative MP has denied ‘favouriting’ an explicit pornographic image on Twitter after a photo of a naked woman tied to a bed appeared on his account.

Karl McCartney insisted he had never made use of the ‘favourite’ button on the cult website – used to endorse messages sent by other people.

It came after the ‘graphic’ image showed up on his Twitter account, sparking ridicule online.

Mr McCartney, the Tory MP for Lincoln, removed the pornographic image and insisted he had not favourited the explicit tweet

Mr McCartney’s Labour rival Lucy Rigby highlighted the tweet, sending a message to her own followers with a picture of the image on her Tory opponent’s account.

She wrote: ‘Someone could do with explaining to our MP Karl McCartney that his Twitter “favourites” are public/viewable.’

The Lincoln MP, who is married with two children, removed the image – showing a full-frontal image of a woman – along with ‘50 other random tweets’ that had been favourited on his Twitter feed.

Mr McCartney said he was concerned that the site could be exploited by ‘malicious and salacious attempts to embarrass the account holder’ as the general election approaches.

He said: ‘It was brought to my attention earlier today by a number of people that a Twitter post from Lincoln Labour's prospective parliamentary candidate showed a pornographic tweet and around 50 other random tweets that had been favourited on my Twitter account from the past four years.'

The prospective Labour MP later admitted she had been wrong to send the image to her followers without taking measure to blur its explicit nature

Mr McCartney added: ‘I have removed all favourites from my account, I have reset my password and those who follow me regularly on Twitter will know that I have never been into the practice of favouriting tweets or images in my six to seven years on Twitter and stick to posting or retweeting in the main (25,000 plus) including at times images of interesting cars I see whilst out campaigning.

‘I am writing today to Twitter to express my concern that six months from a general election the security of Twitter accounts needs to be able to stand up to any malicious and salacious attempts to embarrass the account holder, I will await their reply with interest.’
