Castleford shrugged off fears of a Wembley hangover as they beat a resurgent Bradford 32-18 despite the best efforts of Lee Gaskell to move up to second in the First Utility Super League.

The Tigers were left heartbroken by neighbours Leeds Rhinos in the Tetley’s Challenge Cup final last weekend but remain on course for a first Grand Final appearance after a solid victory at the Mend-a-Hose Jungle.

Andy Lynch got the scoring under way in the fifth minute with a try against his former club, who went into the contest on the back of three straight wins, and that was followed by efforts from James Clare, Luke Dorn and Michael Shenton.

Flying high: James Clare scores Castleford's second try against Bradford to move Tigers to second

Gaskell scored Bradford’s sole try in the first half and he went over twice more at the start of the second period to make it a hat-trick.

Daryl Clark eased Castleford’s nerves with a stunning solo try which Marc Sneyd converted before the stand-off slotted over a penalty to make it a perfect afternoon with the boot.

Lynch gave the Tigers the perfect start when he crashed on to a pass from dummy-half Clark and benefited from some weak defence to touch down.

Castleford were celebrating again on 14 minutes after good play by Sneyd and Dorn created the space for Clare to score in the corner in acrobatic fashion.

Sneyd converted from the touchline to make it 12-0, a deficit Bradford thought they had eaten into midway through the first period, only for Dale Ferguson’s try to be ruled out for obstruction.

Castleford were awarded a penalty at the other end for a high shot on Dorn and went close themselves when Clark was held up over the line.

The Tigers did not have to wait too much longer for their third try, Dorn taking a good offload from Shenton and showing a good turn of pace to score.

Already-relegated Bradford registered their first points of the match seven minutes from the break when Gaskell took a pass from Luke Gale, playing against his future employers, and stepped his way to the line.

But the visitors suffered a blow on the stroke of half-time as Shenton cut back inside untouched for a four-pointer, which Sneyd turned into six with his fourth successful kick.

Gaskell went over for an almost identical try to his first-half effort two minutes after the break and quickly completed his hat-trick after Gale put him through a hole 40 metres out and he rounded Dorn to score under the posts.

The Tigers had to do plenty of defending as Bradford strived to pull level, which they would have done but for Jamal Fakir’s fumble just yards from the posts.

The Frenchman’s mistake proved costly as Clark showed the Castleford fans what they will miss when he leaves at the end of the season with a brilliant 80-metre try after taking a quick penalty tap.

The victory was sealed when Sneyd put over a straightforward penalty two minutes from time.
