They have been together 32 years and last night Sting and Trudie Styler looked as loved up as ever as they posed on the red carpet.

The singer, 62, was supporting his wife at a party to celebrate the opening of her latest play, The Seagull, in New York.

She's taking centre stage in the Chekhov play in the city the family have made their home. Despite both growing up in Britain and having a number of properties here, the actress told The Times they 
prefer living in the U.S. after being 'treated unkindly' in their home 
country.

Happy New Yorkers: Trudie Styler and Sting attend an opening night party for her new play, The Seagull, in New York where they now live

She said: 'I don't want to criticise 
my country but there are times I feel Sting and myself have been treated
unkindly. I feel much more relaxed here, not having to second guess 
myself.'

She added: 'Rock stars' wives have never been given an easy time. They weren't nice about Linda McCartney until she died.'

The couple - who wore matching black outfits - are famous for having one of the most rock solid romances in showbiz.

So what's the secret to their lasting union? Styler, 59, told The Times they still have 'chemistry' after all these years and share similar interests.

She said: 'There's the chemistry, that's undeniable, and it's still there. I love him more each day. Also, we like each other.'

On their wedding day: The couple married in 1992 and renewed their vows this year

She added: 'We laugh at the same 
things, we're Fifties kids - we have the same points of reference, like 
Morecambe and Wise. We're very alike: we both have working class 
backgrounds and had similar struggles trying to carve out identities in 
the arts.'

She said their relationship contrasts to that of her parents who raised her and her sisters in a council house in Stoke Prior.

'I realise now, when I see my relationship with my own husband, that they had a rather humdrum relationship,' she said.

Then: Sting and Trudie in the Eighties

Now: 32 years later, Trudie said 'I love him more each day'

When it comes to why Sting thinks their marriage 
has lasted, he joked: 'Our relationship is successful because I make all 
the big decisions and she makes all the small ones. Luckily, in 32 years
together, we've never had to make any big decisions.'

The
pair met in the early Eighties when she was famous for her role in TV 
show Poldark and he was hitting the charts with the Police after giving 
up a career as a teacher in Northumberland (under his real name Gordon 
Sumner).

He was married at the time to actress Frances Tomelty, with whom he has two children. They separated in 1982 and Styler
became his new partner not long after. But Styler refuses to elaborate 
on the early days of their romance saying, 'I don't ever talk about this
chapter because it exposes too many people whose privacy should be 
respected.'

Styler and Sting tied the knot in 1992 (renewing their vows in a ceremony in India earlier this year), and they have four children - Mickey, Jake, Coco and Giacomo.

During their marriage, his music career has continued to flourish while her work 'took a back seat for a while'. But she pointed out: 'It's not like I didn't do anything'.

She set up two film production companies, Xingu Films and Maven Pictures. The latter produced the recently released adaptation of Irvine Welsh's novel Filth starring James McAvoy.
