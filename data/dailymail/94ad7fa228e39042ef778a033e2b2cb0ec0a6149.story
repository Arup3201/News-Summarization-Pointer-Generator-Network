Fight for justice: A Metropolitan Police team is to fly to Libya to continue the investigation into the murder of Wpc Yvonne Fletcher 28 years after her death

The killer of police officer Yvonne Fletcher outside the Libyan embassy in London in 1984 was never convicted, but now 28 years on there are fresh hopes that her family may finally see justice.

A Metropolitan Police team is to fly to Libya to continue the investigation into the murder of Wpc Yvonne Fletcher.

David Cameron said the visit was a 'really positive step forward' in the inquiry into the 1984 killing of the officer, who was shot dead as she policed an anti-Gaddafi demonstration outside the Libyan Embassy in London.

Her killing triggered an 11 day police siege of the embassy in St James's Square and the UK cut all diplomatic ties with the Middle East nation.

Ms Fletcher's mother Queenie, father Tim and sister Sarah Parsons have been hoping to see justice for their daughter ever since.

In 2009 the family and friends of Yvonne gathered at a memorial in her honour at St James's square, the spot where she was killed, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of her death.

Mr Cameron made the announcement as the north African state's interim Prime Minister Abdurrahim El-Keib visited 10 Downing Street.

Mr El-Keib promised that his country would 'work very closely together' with the UK to resolve outstanding questions about the killing of the 25-year-old Wpc Fletcher, who was part of a team of 30 officers sent to St. James's Square to keep the peace during a demonstration by Libyan dissidents opposed to the rule of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi.

It is believed she was hit by a shot fired from within the People's Bureau.

Mr El-Keib worked with the opposition while in exile during Muammar Gaddafi's dictatorship, and said he knew some of those involved in the demonstration.

He told Mr Cameron: 'The Fletcher case is a case that is close to my heart personally. I had friends who were demonstrating that day next to the embassy.'

'It is a sad story. It is very unfortunate that it has anything to do with the Libyan people.

Changing Times: David Cameron said allowing British police to fly to Libya investigate Wpc Fletcher's killing was a really positive step. Diplomatic relations were cut with Libyan leader Muammar Gadaffi, right, following the incident in 1984

'I am here to tell you that we will work very closely together to resolve anything related to that issue.'

Hopes of finding the killer of Wpc Fletcher were first raised following the revolution which toppled the dictator last year.

But so far, plans to send a police team to Libya had been frustrated by a failure to secure approval from local authorities.

Officers from New Scotland Yard and Home Office Minister James Brokenshire met Mr El-Keib today to discuss the Fletcher case.Commander Richard Walton, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism

Commander Richard Walton, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism said he was determined to get justice for Ms Fletcher.

He added: 'We have never lost our resolve to solve this murder and achieve justice for Yvonne's family. We see today's announcement as significant.'

Detectives remain in regular contact with Wpc Fletcher's family and update them on developments.

Mr El-Keib said Libya wanted to be 'long-term friends and partners' with Britain, and paid tribute to the role which the UK played in the international military mission to protect civilians from Gaddafi's forces during last year's uprising.

Tragic: The killing of Wpc Yvonne Fletcher sparked an 11 day police siege of the Libyan embassy in St James's Square

Addressing Mr Cameron he said: 'You took a bold decision when it was very difficult for many to even consider supporting the Libyan people. You took that decision which inspired many of us.'

Mr Cameron said: 'I am very proud of the role that Britain played to help secure a successful outcome in Libya and the support we gave through the Nato mission.

'I am very much looking forward to hearing about the progress towards a full democracy in Libya and the elections which you hope to hold before Ramadan this year.'

Mr El-Keib was appointed interim prime minister of Libya in October last year. Elections for a national assembly for Libya are expected in June or July, though no date has yet been set.

Mr Cameron and Mr El-Keib were also thought to be discussing the reconstruction of the country following last year's revolution.

And just days after the death of the only person convicted of the Lockerbie bombing, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, they may also discuss whether any further evidence relating to the atrocity has emerged in the wake of the downfall of the Gaddafi regime.

Mr El-Keib spent much of his life working abroad as an academic and businessman in the United States and UAE, and played no part in Gaddafi's administration.
