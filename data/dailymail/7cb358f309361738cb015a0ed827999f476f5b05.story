David Williams, 34, swindled more than £120,000 in benefits that he was not entitled to

A benefits cheat swindled £120,000 by claiming he was wheelchair bound, but was actually working as a TV aerial fitter and climbing onto roofs, a court heard.

David Williams, 34, from Prenton, Wirral, dishonestly obtained state benefits over a period of eight years, including child tax credits where he claimed two of his daughters were severely disabled.

He also callously charged an 88-year-old woman £7,500 for a fuse box, which he never even fitted, and used the money to buy a van for his satellite dish installation business, Go Digital Aerials.

Williams appeared at Liverpool Crown Court on a mobile scooter and as he complained of hearing difficulties had to be wheeled into the body of the court for the hearing.

A jury heard that the elderly woman had lost trust in anyone calling at her Wirral home afterwards and 'lived out the last year of her life effectively without opening the door'.

Judge Dennis Watson QC said: 'The impact of the offence on her, I have no doubt, accelerated the decline in her health. You performed a wicked con trick on her, conning her out of £7,500 so you could buy yourself a van.'

When her concerned friend and neighbour pursued the matter he 'blustered and bluffed and did your best to intimidate her',  judge said. 

By the time his dishonesty came to light he had obtained £120,878 in benefits over an eight year period. 

Some he obtained from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) by purporting he was too immobile to work.

While the rest came from HM Revenues & Customs (HMRC) where he claimed the opposite - that he was working and needed top up working tax credits.

He also obtained child care credits for his five children and 'particularly callously and cynically told lies that two were disabled,' said the judge.

Liverpool Crown Court heard that when Williams told the DWP in 2005 that he was unable to walk he spoke of hoping for an operation so he could get back to work 'as I believe a man should provide for his family but I cannot at the moment.'  

Williams pleaded guilty to five DWP fraud offences spanning eight years and five trading standards offences involving fraud and engaging in unfair commercial practices.

Judge Watson sentenced him to 39 months in prison and afterwards he had to be escorted by the dock officers to a suitable taxi to take him to prison - as the scooter was too large to get into the holding cells downstairs.

Judge Watson said that while he accepted he has diabetes and complained of pain 'there is little objective clinical evidence of substantial medical difficulties.'

Michael Davies, defending, said that Williams, who has previous convictions for fraud, had never been to jail and because of his 'bulk' he would find that difficult and his children would miss him.

He added that he had mobility problems because of the affect on his legs of his weight.

Kevin Slack, prosecuting, said that Williams began legitimately claiming incapacity benefit in 2002 and said he could no longer work as a welder because of pain in his knees.

But in 2005 when he claimed he was unable to walk at all he notified HMRC that he was working 16 hours a week as a carpet cleaner and claimed tax credits.

Investigations later showed that been 2006 and 2012, £40,000 was paid into his bank account - mainly in cheques from his work activities, said Mr Slack.

He also claimed child care credits claiming that his wife also worked 16 hours a week and the children were in a nursery costing hundreds of pounds a week.

However,she was not working and they were not at a nursery and the prosecution claimed 'it was complete fiction'.

In 2009 he said that two of his daughters were disabled so their credit claim would be enhanced. 

'That was completely false, neither was disabled or in receipt of disability living allowance' he added.

Williams had been claiming Disability Living Allowance for himself since 2006 and the next year when he renewed his claim he stated he needed a wheelchair to get around.

He also told authorities that he needed his wife to care for him 'every hour of the day', could not get upstairs and needed help to feed himself.

Mr Slack added that it was not claimed it was false from the start but by early 2010 there had been a significant improvement and he began running an aerial and satelilte dish installation business, involving climbing up ladders and onto roofs.

The prosecutor said that the pensioner who Williams charged an 'exorbitant' amount for a fuse box had met him earlier and got in touch because he also dealt with electrical matters.

After his deception came to light she was left upset, frightened, her health deteriorated and she no longer trusted anyone and kept her curtains closed.

Meanwhile he banked her cheque and spent £4,840 on a new van which carried logos, as did his website, claiming he was affiliated with various trade bodies, which was untrue.
