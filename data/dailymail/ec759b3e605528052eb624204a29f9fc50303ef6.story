Famed artist, scientist, and engineer Leonardo di Vinci created a beeswax sculpture of a man riding a horse in 1508, thought to be a model for a larger commission.

But the Italian Renaissance master died before the model could be cast in metal, and mysteriously vanished from public sight for centuries.

But after painstaking search, the casting was recovered, and a bronze sculpture of the horse and rider was finally unveiled.

Mastery: The first bronze casting of Leonardo da Vinci's original Horse and Rider wax sculpture was unveiled in Los Angeles; it took three years to produce

The original beeswax sculpture, as well as the carefully constructed cast, were put on display in Las Vegas in an exhibition called ‘Da Vinci – the Genius’ after their unveiling at the Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills, California.

The tale of how the cast was preserved, re-discovered, and re-created is one of deep fascination.

In 1508, the great artist created the 12-inch high, 12-inch long beeswax sculpture of a Renaissance military man mounted on a bucking horse, intended for Da Vinci’s friend Charles d’Amboise.

However, Da Vinci died in 1519 without completing his work, and the cast was passed onto his apprentice, Francesco Mezi.

According to Yahoo News, the sculpture was kept safe in the Mezi family until the 1930s, when World War II came to Italy. The family then moved it to Switzerland for safekeeping. 

Little was known about the sculpture’s whereabouts until the 1980s, when a group of roving businessmen made it their mission to track it down.

Casting call: The new mould was taken from Leonardo's beeswax sculpture

Businessman Richard A. Lewis purchased the statue in 1985, but was unsure of his purchase until he spoke with Dr Carlo Pedretti, an expert on the artist and professor emeritus of art history at The University of California – Los Angeles.

After meticulously studying the relic, Dr Pedretti confirmed that it was indeed authentic.

Twenty-five years later, Mr Lewis hired the American Fine Arts Foundry to create a bronze sculpture, a process that took three years.

In addition to the first replica, Art Encounter will make a limited amount of additional facsimiles to sell to art collectors. Mr Lewis said that $1million of the proceeds will be donated to the Salvation Army’s substance abuse program.

According to the Las Vegas Sun, the replicas will be sold at $25,000 to $35,000.

He told Yahoo News at the unveiling: ‘It’s a magnificent piece of art and I’d like to have as many people as possible be able to appreciate it.’

The statue will make its rounds to London and New York after the Las Vegas exhibit closes. 

Born in 1452, Da Vinci was the bastard son of a peasant and a land owner, and began apprenticing for an artist at the age of 14. By age 20, he began his own workshop, having learned under Verrocchio the skills of leather working, metal arts, sculpting, drawing, and carpentry. 

By 1482, Da Vinci was quickly gaining fame for his work, completing his fresco painting The Last Supper during this time. He was privately commissioned to paint what is arguably his most famous work, the Mona Lisa.

The painting of the mysteriously smiling woman was completed around 1507.

The artist also had some 13,000 pages worth of scientific and anatomical sketches. He died in 1519.

The statue is considered to be the only surviving example of his sculptural work, and shows that the Renaissance man truly deserves the title of master artist.
