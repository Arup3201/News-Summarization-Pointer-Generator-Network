The party city of Cancun, in Mexico, has been rocked after two gunmen, armed with a machine gun and a pistol, stormed a crowded bar and shot dead seven drinkers.

As tens of thousands of American Spring Breakers partied across the city, the duo burst into The Mermaid bar, on the outskirts of town, and sprayed the room with bullets.

A further four people were wounded in the attack in a working class area of the city which nestles on Mexico's palm-fringed Caribbean coast.

Public Safety Secretary Jesus Aiza says most of the victims belonged to a taxi drivers union.

While the motive for the shooting 
remains unclear, he added that soldiers are guarding the hospital where 
the wounded are being treated amid fears of a follow up attack.

He says detectives are still trying to determine a motive for the attack.

But the city has seen a boost in the number of tourists, that authorities attributed to people avoiding Pacific 
Coast resorts such as Acapulco, which have been hit by high-profile 
incidents of criminal violence in recent years.

Cancun tourism director Maximo Garcia Rocha said some major tourist agencies were expecting as many as 43,000 spring breakers.

With
vacationers arriving en masse in Cancun, local officials have stepped 
up patrols of marines, soldiers and special tourist police in zones 
packed with hotels and bars.
