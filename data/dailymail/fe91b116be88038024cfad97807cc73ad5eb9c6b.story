Labour ran a campaign portraying a cut in tax on incomes above £150,000 from 50p to 45p as a lottery-style windfall, but the party admitted its headline claim was misleading

The Tories last night condemned a – Labour advertising campaign which portrays the cut in the top rate of tax as a lottery-style windfall for millionaires.

The rate paid on incomes above £150,000 will drop from 50p to 45p on Saturday – prompting Ed Miliband’s team to distribute leaflets describing the reduction as ‘a £100,000 win for everyone earning £1 million’.

However, the party admitted last night that the headline claim was misleading: anyone taking home £1 million a year will actually see their annual tax bill fall by just over £42,000.

The leaflets are dotted with numbered balls to ram home the ‘lottery’ point. 

A spokesman for Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: ‘If you read the whole leaflet, it makes clear £100,000 is the average tax cut for those earning £1 million or more.

‘It would dilute the impact if you put all the caveats on the front.’

A spokesman for George Osborne said: ‘The 50p tax raised no money. If we are going to keep attracting investment and creating jobs we need a competitive tax system. We get that – Ed Balls doesn’t.’
