Britain must end its throw away culture and repair fridges, washing machines and cars instead of buying more ‘stuff’, a top government adviser has warned.

Professor David MacKay said attempts to cut energy consumption and hit green targets are being hampered by the rush to buy new appliances instead of adopting a ‘make do and mend’ mentality.

The chief scientific adviser to the energy department warned that the return to economic growth will make the problem even worse, because families will have more money to spend on new purchases.

A quarter of all electrical appliances sent to landfill could be repaired and reused, saving £200million-a-year

A quarter of all waste electrical and electronic equipment which is sent to landfill could be reused, worth £200million a year, according to official figures.

Government waste agency Wrap warns that between now and 2020 the UK will buy 100million tonnes of new electronic goods, which will include components containing 20 tonnes of gold, 400 tonnes of silver and 7 tonnes of platinum.

Prof MacKay said the public must learn to keep using cars and appliances until they stop working, and then have them broken down for spare parts.

He told a Department of Energy and Climate Change newsletter: ‘One difficult challenge is the way in which economic activity and growth currently is coupled to buying lots of stuff and then throwing it away.

‘When a fridge, clothes-washer, or microwave develops a fault we throw it away instead of repairing it. Car manufacturers love us to buy a new car every few years.’

Repairs: Families must go back to the days of having appliances fixed, as seen in a 1977 episode of Coronation Street when Harry Brown (Alan Hulse) was seen mending Hilda Ogden's (Jean Alexander) new washing machine.

Reusing appliances and furniture could 
save families £1billion-a-year while businesses could save £17 billion, 
the government claims. It would also create work for repairs shops.

Prof Mackay wrote the book ‘Sustainable Energy - without the hot air’ and teaches at Cambridge University.

He said people had to get used to the 
idea of reusing parts from appliances instead of dumping electricals and
 buying brand new replacements.

‘The whole system could use significantly less energy if we designed things to last, if we only bought things we need to use, if we used them for their full life, repairing them when necessary, and then disassembled them carefully so that components could be re-used. How can we get there from here?’

However, with British economic growth gaining momentum, persuading people not to return to spending will be difficult.

New figures this week showed new car sales in Britain have hit the highest level for six years.

Some 2.26million new vehicles were registered in 2013 according to official figures - a 10.8 per cent jump on 2012 and the best annual total since 2007.

However, critics noted that newer cars and appliances are likely to be more energy efficient.

Tory MP Peter Lilley, who sits on the Commons energy and climate change committee, told the Telegraph: ‘If we repair the inefficient ones we will consume far more energy.

‘Prof MacKay should either decide whether he’s chief scientific adviser or whether he’s going to join Friends of the Earth and knit his own socks.’
