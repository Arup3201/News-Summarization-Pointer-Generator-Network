A blushing bride spent 200 hours hand stitching 22,000 individual goose feathers onto her dream dress.

Cheryl McGlynn, 24, from Middlesbrough, was delighted to wear her one-of-a-kind dress for her wedding after working day and night for a fortnight sewing on the white feathers - which cost £1,200 alone.

The mother-of-one runs her own business wedding dress business, Cheryl Holmsrom Bespoke, and spent more than six months planning, designing and creating her masterpiece for her marriage to sweetheart Joel, 25.

She managed to continue working, designing and making dresses for brides-to-be who wanted to use her services.

Cheryl said that she had always wanted to be the person to design and make the dress for her own big day as she would never trust another designer.

She believes the dress would have cost more than £7,000 to make if she had designed it for a client, and is now planning on breaking it down to recreate another to gain some extra money.

The amazing dress features a tight corset-style top which was all hand embroidered by Cheryl, flowing down to the incredible train of delicate goose feathers.

She also added hers and her husband's names to the back of the dress for an extra personal touch.

Alongside the stunning creation, Cheryl also made a beautiful 18th-century inspired dress for her daughter Honey, two, and dresses for her three bridesmaids.

Cheryl said: 'I worked hard day and night without stopping for weeks before the wedding to make sure everything was right.

'I just hid up in my little sewing room and got stuck in. I had to hand stitch each of the 22,000 goose feathers, which I made sure I got from a UK supplier.

'My final piece in my Art and Design degree was based on Swan Lake and when I graduated and Joel proposed, I've been obsessed with feathers and knew I wanted to have them on my wedding dress. 

'I wanted it to be a winter wedding because Joel popped the question on Christmas Day in 2011. The dress had to have a winter theme but I wanted it to be extravagant because it reflects my personality perfectly.

'It is a unique piece. I don't know any other designer around here that works so intricately with feathers. I had to make my own wedding dress, it's always been my dream.'

Cheryl's wedding to Joel, an HGV driver, took place in St Cuthbert's church in Middlesbrough on December 5.

They had their reception at Rushpool Hall in Saltburn-by-the-sea and all eyes were on the sensational train of goose feathers that swished at every step she took. 

She said: 'It was the best feeling in the world to finally get it on, I felt like a princess.

'It was so much work that I felt really overwhelmed when I was walking down the aisle. I was even still working on my head piece the night before. 

'I ended up crying because I'd spilt wine down the front of it. 

'People usually come to me with a design and we look at exactly what they want so to do my own really was fitting.

'I'm used to doing embroidery by hand which can take months but it was a bit of extra pressure when it's your own wedding, especially with something as delicate as goose feathers.'
