Dual Derby winner Australia is 1-3 favourite to produce the command performance in the Qipco Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown that organisers of the inaugural Irish Champions weekend are praying for.

Aidan O’Brien’s colt faces six rivals in the 1million euro 10-furlong contest, three of whom finished behind him in his most recent victory in the International Stakes at York.

O’Brien has promised Australia will be a much fitter horse than he was at the Knavesmire.

The trainer said: ‘He was only ready to go racing that day. He'd had a good break and done very well. He was only ready for a good racecourse gallop.’

There are five group ones over the new Irish Champions weekend with three more at the Curragh tomorrow where the Irish Leger is the feature.
