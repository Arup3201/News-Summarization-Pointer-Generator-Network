Probe: Slough's Labour leader Robert Anderson

A council leader is being investigated by police for allegedly snatching a rival party’s leaflet from a letterbox during last week’s council elections.

Robert Anderson, leader of Slough Council in Berkshire, is alleged to have put his hand through the front-door flap, removed a Ukip leaflet and replaced it with his own Labour flyer.

Mr Anderson, who sits on the board of the Government’s Audit Commission spending watchdog, insists it’s  an unfortunate misunderstanding.

But Ukip complained to Thames Valley Police, leading to a probe.

The householder at the centre of the row, Ian Church, 36, said he saw a hand come through his letterbox.

‘The blue leaflet was taken out and then a red one pushed through.

'I thought, “Hang on, that’s theft,” so I put on my shoes and went outside and saw Rob Anderson posting leaflets through the house next door.

'I knew it was him as he’s well known in Slough and I’d seen him about.

‘I said, “I’ve just watched you take something out of my letterbox.”

Complaint: The leaflet at the centre of the row. Ukip were beaten in the Britwell ward by 1,189 votes

'He said, “Do you want it back?” I said yes and he went over to a colleague and came back with the leaflet. He gave it to me and apologised.’

Mr Anderson, who has led the council since 2008, secured 1,189 votes to beat his Ukip rivals in the Britwell ward.

But the anti-EU party lodged a complaint with the police after other residents said leaflets had disappeared from their homes.

Two officers went to Mr Church’s home to take a statement and the force’s investigation is ‘ongoing’.

Mr Anderson, 50, said: ‘I did  not take Mr Church’s or anyone else’s leaflet.’
