For one soap fan a simple souvenir T-shirt wasn't enough when it comes to expressing her devotion to her favourite programme.

Lindsay Pearce, from Calgary, Canada, is such a huge fan of the long running ITV soap Coronation Street that she has characters from the show permanently inked on to her leg.

Her elaborate Weatherfield-themed tattoos include portraits of Corrie's stars including Hayley Cropper, Rita Sullivan  and Norris Cole.

And luckily for Lindsay she has one very helpful connection which means her inkings aren't too pricey in the form of her tattoo artist husband Steve Pearce.  

Together the devoted pair have spent hours creating the skin-based tribute to their favourite Mancunian show.

Steve, who runs his own tattoo studio in Calgary, has painstakingly etched images of characters in the soap onto his wife Lindsay's leg.

The couple, who say their shared love of Weatherfield helps keep their marriage together, took on the project ahead of a visit to Manchester this year.

They will be finishing the body art masterpiece in front of an audience at the Tattoo Tea Party, held at Event City near the Trafford Centre over three days from February 28 to March 1.

The husband and wife also plan to fit in a visit to the Coronation Street Tour while they are in town.

The Corrie montage on Lindsay's thigh includes Roy and Hayley Cropper around the hip, a smiling Betty Williams is at mid-thigh, while Rita Fairclough is inked above the knee 

Steve, whose tattoo studio is called Immaculate Concept, says that the most difficult part of the process was settling on a Corrie character to ink. 

'We thought is would be a cool idea to do a Coronation Street tattoo before we left and maybe finish it at the show.

'The hard part was narrowing down the characters we wanted to use causing the piece to keep getting larger and larger.'

Despite all of their hard work on the project Steve said that they haven't quite finished their tribute but plan to work on it more once in Manchester.  

'We have fit as many classic characters as we could but may add some more in the future.

'We got close to finishing the piece but will definitely work on it at the show and once we get back home.

'We look forward to returning to the Manchester Tea Party in 2016 with a fully complete Coronation Street tattoo with background images and maybe a few new additions.'

Wife Lindsay says that no matter how hectic their lives become they always make time for their favourite show.

'We both lead pretty busy lives running a couple of businesses but we always manage to meet up at the end of a busy day to watch Corrie.'
