The doctor of a dementia patient was not responsible for a crash the 85-year-old woman caused that killed her longtime partner, a jury found on Thursday.

The family of 90-year-old William Powers, who died in the 2010 crash, sued Dr Arthur Daigneault for wrongful death arguing that he should have initiated the process to strip Lorraine Sullivan of her driving license as he was treating her for dementia.

As she drove back from grocery shopping on May 27 2010, Sullivan accidentally steered her Toyota Corolla into oncoming traffic, causing a crash which killed Powers, her partner of more than thirty years.

Cleared: A jury found Dr Arthur Daigneault, right, not responsible for the death of William Powers, left. Powers died after his 85-year-old girlfriend, Lorraine Sullivan, crashed their car. Powers' family argued that Daigneault should have taken steps to remove Sullivan's driving license as he treated her for dementia

Arthur Daigneault, who practices near California’s Orange County retirement community Laguna Woods Village, had been treating Sullivan for dementia in the two years before the crash, reported the Los Angeles Times.

Powers’ children, Craig Powers and Andrea Wooldridge, launched the wrongful death lawsuit believing that Daigneault should have alerted authorities that Sullivan may need to have her licence taken away.

The case questions at which point doctors have a responsibility to alert the DMV that their elderly patients may have a problem with driving.

California law requires doctors to report patients with 'disorders characterized by lapses of consciousness' to local health authorities, who then notify the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).

Under this law, doctors use their own judgement as to whether a patient is too impaired to be behind a wheel.

In December 2007, Sullivan told Daigneault that she was suffering from memory loss, reported the L.A. Times.

Tests showed declining memory loss over the next year and, in June 2009, Daigneault prescribed her an Alzheimer’s drug.

The doctor changed her prescription to a different dementia drug when Sullivan reported that her memory getting worse.

Two weeks before the accident, Daigneault saw Sullivan but did not consider her memory problems severe enough to report.

Sullivan’s daughter testified that her mother was the same capable woman she had always been and said she was unaware her mother had been diagnosed for dementia, even though the two saw each other weekly.

Powers himself had stopped driving early in 2010 on his family's insistence. However, his family didn’t express concern about him being a passenger in Sullivan’s car, according to court records.

On May 27, Sullivan and Powers were headed home when Sullivan took a wrong left turn and a Mercedes smashed into the passenger side of the Toyota Corolla.

Powers died from his injuries six weeks later. Sullivan, who suffered head injuries in the crash, has not driven since the accident.

Wooldridge, 53, said that she hoped the case will take drivers with dementia off the road and prevent further accidents.

Last year, the DMV stripped 26,428 people of their licenses for medical reasons; a breakdown of their ages and medical conditions was not available, reported the L.A. Times.

The laws concerning elderly drivers 
differs from state to state, in California, drivers older than 70 are 
required to renew their licenses in person.
