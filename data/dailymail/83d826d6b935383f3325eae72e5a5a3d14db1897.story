The founders of Ask.fm have claimed they are the ones who have been bullied - even though the website has been linked to a string of teenage suicides.

In a defiant interview, Ilja and Mark Terebin said that the social networking site had become an ‘easy target’ but was not to blame for anything.

The Latvian brothers also said that they were being attacked because they were Eastern European by critics who wanted to 'earn some credit' against them.

The Terebins have rarely spoken out to defend themselves despite a slew of critics calling for their business to be closed down.

In total at least seven deaths have been linked to Ask.fm in Britain and Ireland with more in the US.

Speaking to TIME magazine, the Terebins admitted that bullying took place on Ask.fm but said that the risk of it happening was outweighed by the benefits of the site.

Tragedy: Hannah Smith, 14, from Leicestershire who hanged herself in August 2013 after suffering months of abuse from bullies on Ask.fm

They said it would help young people become more ‘open-minded’ and to ‘develop more freedom’, skills that would help them in later life.

Ilja, 35, blamed society at large for anything unsavoury that went took place on Ask.fm.

He said: ‘We teach people to bully. Look at the media.

‘Do you have muscles? You’re a cool guy. Are you fat? You’re a loser. Do you f*** girls? You’re a cool guy.

‘Do
 you not f*** girls? You’re a loser. We can’t do anything about it, if 
parents are drinking beer, watching TV and reading celebrity magazines.

‘People are looking for someone to blame all the time, and we look like an easy target.

‘We’re in Eastern Europe, without a huge budget or proper lawyers. So why not bully us and get some credit?’

Ask.fm, which was founded in 2010, has 60 million users worldwide and makes millions of pounds in advertising revenue each year.

It employs 58 people out of the office in the Latvian capital, Riga.

In
 the interview Ilja said that there was no point calling for Ask.fm to 
be shut down because something else would just pop up in its place.

He said: ‘Close down the website? You will get another website! Close McDonald’s!

‘Close the Internet! Close the roads, and ban cars!

‘Everyone wants to ask what’s wrong 
with us. No one wants to ask the important questions. Why is there 
selfishness? Why is there no laughter?’

Grieving: Hannah Smith's sister Jo and father David Smith at their home in Lutterworth, Leicestershire. At least seven deaths have been linked to Ask.fm in Britain and Ireland

The
 brothers also admitted that the negative publicity had impacted their 
business but that they wanted to expand and open an office in London or 
New York.

They said that in 
recent months they have responded to the criticism and beefed up their 
monitoring team and hired Annie Mullins, a leading British cyberbullying
 expert.
