A man who suffered a small cut whilst working on his car is now learning to live with one arm after the scratch turned into a flesh-eating disease forcing doctors to amputate.

Michael Money, a 46-year-old mechanic,  cut his knuckle changing a steering box and forgot to wash his hands which led to 
necrotizing fasciitis which quickly spread up his arm.

Mr Money, from Bellingham, Washington begged doctors not to amputate, but medical staff had no choice but to remove his right arm above the elbow in order to save his life.

Dangerous development: Michael Money had his arm amputated after a small cut on his knuckle became infected with flesh-eating bacteria

He now
faces adapting to a new life and a new career, leaving the industry 
where he has worked since the age of 17.

On the day of the accident last year Mr Money, who has spent the last 20 years in the tire business, was changing the steering box on his pickup truck when he cut his knuckle.

‘I just kept working,’ he told Komo News. ‘I didn't wash my hands until later that day - and that's how it got infected.’

Mr Money called to the hospital where doctors immediately diagnosed him with necrotizing fasciitis.

‘I was begging them - please don't cut my arm off. But they said “If you don't stop it, it gets into your heart. You can die”.'

Doctors amputated his right hand and forearm, effectively saving his life.

Pleading: Mr Money said he begged the doctors to save his arm but it was too late

Mr Money now hopes to be able to fit a bionic arm and to be able to return to work, but unfortunately mechanical arms are costly and Mr Money has yet to find a new occupation after a lifetime working with his two hands.

‘I still get enough to barely live. I'm not making it. It turned my life upside down.’

Michael is currently working on raising the $40,000 - $60,000 needed for a new arm through donations and fundraising and refuses to give up on his future.

‘I don't want to stay home. I want to go back to society. I've got a lot of work left I can do.’
