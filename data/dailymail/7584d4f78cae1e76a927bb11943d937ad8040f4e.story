A badly ill toddler's life was saved thanks to a replica of her heart made with a 3D printer.

Two-year-old Mina Khan was born with a hole in the wall between two chambers of her heart which left her struggling to survive.

Exhausted from pumping blood around the hole, which was initially feared too big to treat, she was left breathless and couldn't eat - even her hair wouldn't grow.

Thriving at last: Two-year-old Mina Khan was born with a hole in the wall between two chambers of her heart but surgeons were able to fix it thanks to a 3D facsimile of the organ printed in plastic 

But after doctors at St Thomas' Hospital in London created a precise copy of her tiny heart, including its defect, they were able to perfect the complicated procedure needed to cure Mina.

It meant when surgeons finally operated on the tiny girl they knew exactly what they were looking for and what to do when they found out.

'Mina is like a normal little girl now,' her mother Natasha Buckley, from Bury, Greater Manchester, told Sunday Times science editor Jonathan Leake. 'She is eating, has stopped being sick and is growing at last.'

Mina was born with a heart so deformed that doctors said it could not be repaired. With a hole between her ventricles, the two pumps that circulate blood to the heart and the lungs, she was left constantly tired, sickly and unable to put on weight, her mother told the Sunday Times.

Her only hope was for surgeons to try to patch the hole, but toddlers' hearts are so small that even the most experienced paedatric heart specialists find them difficult to handle, making any operation risky.

But thanks to the 3D model of her heart, based on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerised tomography scans, surgeons were able to design a bespoke patch and understand how it needed to be stitched into place.

Pioneering technique: Dr Gerald Greil, who has pioneered the use of the 3D-printing technique at St Thomas', said the model he and colleagues created helped them tailor the Gore-Tex patch stitched into Mina's heart

Professor David Anderson led the operating team. He told the Sunday Times Mina had a 'very complex' hole in her heart - the kind of case that can pose a 'huge intellectual challenge'.

'The 3D printing meant we could create a model of her heart and then see the inside of it with a replica of the hole as it looked when the heart was pumping,' he said. 'We could go into the operation with a much better idea of what we would find.'

Dr Gerald Greil, who has pioneered the use of the 3D-printing technique at St Thomas', said the model he and colleagues created also helped them tailor the Gore-Tex patch stitched into Mina's heart.

The use of 3D-printed 'practice organs' made to measure from MRI scans of patients promises to become an important surgical tool in coming years.

The process has featured in America and surgeons at a New York hospital created a 3D heart that saved the life of a two-week-old baby.

And in Southampton an entrepreneur with a 3D printing services company persuaded doctors to let him help them by making a model of his own kidney when he needed an operation to remove a kidney stone.

Medics say having the plastic kidney slashed an hour from his two-hour kidney stone removal operation earlier this month and the hospital is now trialling the process with 21 other patients.

Surgeon Bhaskar Somani, of Southampton General Hospital, said: It makes our job easier going in.

'The 3D model helps because it gives us a rough estimation of where to come from and to be more precise.'
