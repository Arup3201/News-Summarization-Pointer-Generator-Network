Nearly 2,000 rare American coins amassed over 90 years by a 102-year-old Missouri collector have sold for $23 million at a two-day New York City auction.

Retired St. Louis lawyer, Eric P. Newman, began collecting in the 1930s, only paying about $7,500 for the 1,800 piece collection, Heritage Auctions co-Chairman Jim Halperin said yesterday.

Halperin says a 1795 U.S. silver dollar in almost pristine condition sold for $910,625 and another one from 1799 sold for $822,500 in the online and in-person auction.

He says a rare quarter-dollar from 1796, the first year the denomination was produced by the U.S. Mint, sold for $1,527,500. He says Newman paid only $100 for it.

The founder and president of the Certified Acceptance Corporation told the International Business Times that the coin is 'unbelievable, almost unreal. We did not think that it could exist.'

Proceeds from the sale will go toward supporting the Eric P. Newman Numismatic Education Society in Missouri.

Newman's coin sale is one of the largest on record, but he's not the only collector to see for millions.

In 1997, Louis Eliasberg's coin collection sold for $45 million.

Eliasberg was the first person to have a collection of every coin minted in the U.S., which dated back to 1792. 

Eliasberg had died 21 years before his collection sold for $45m though.
