Marouane Fellaini has never intentionally injured an opponent, claims the Manchester United midfielder's father.

Belgium international Fellaini came in for criticism last Sunday after he caught Liverpool's Welsh international Joe Allen with an elbow to the face, leaving the midfielder with a bloodied nose.

Fellaini was not punished by the referee or UEFA for the incident and his father has since defended his son, citing the height difference of the two players, with Fellaini standing at 6ft 4in compared to Liverpool's 5ft 4in Allen.

Abdellatif Fellaini told Derniere Heure: 'Marouane didn't do it on purpose. Have you seen how those Welshmen put their feet? Have you seen what they did to [Dries] Mertens? They had to be played strongly and Marouane did, but he never wanted to injure someone.

'Marouane has, in fact, never injured anyone intentionally in his career.

'However, he has already been hurt on the field. Besides, you must also realise Marouane is very large. When he goes into battle with a small player, his elbows are level with the face of his opponent. Against his will.

'He knows himself that he is not a dirty player and can look straight into the mirror.'
