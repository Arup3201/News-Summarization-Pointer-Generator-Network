The frontrunner to be Labour’s new leader in Scotland yesterday demanded full control over income tax for Edinburgh despite deep splits in the party over the implications of the move.

Jim Murphy, a former shadow Cabinet minister, said he was backing full devolution to dispel the idea that senior figures in the party were ‘more interested in Labour than Scotland’.

He said he would introduce a new 50p top rate of tax for the wealthiest in Scotland if he becomes First Minister – and he added that Ed Miliband and Ed Balls ‘can read about it in the papers like everyone else’.

Mr Murphy made the announcement before the publication tomorrow of a cross-party commission on which extra powers should be devolved to the Scottish Parliament following the No vote in September’s independence referendum.

The Smith Commission, which was charged by David Cameron with getting an agreement among parties, is expected to recommend devolving extra power over income tax.

Both the Tories and the Liberal Democrats support the idea, but senior Labour figures have warned it will undermine the integrity of the UK.

Shadow Chancellor Mr Balls is said to have warned colleagues it is also likely to mean Scottish MPs being barred from voting on tax affairs at Westminster – a move that could make it impossible for a future Labour government to pass Budgets.

Instead, Labour has previously backed the idea of devolving control of 75 per cent of the basic rate of income tax to Scotland.

Former Labour MP Andrew Mackinlay, who represented an Essex constituency, said: ‘If Labour agree that the Scots Parliament shall fix income tax rates in Scotland, it must also accept that Scots MPs in Westminster can longer vote on income taxation levels for the rest of the United Kingdom.

‘A commitment this week to devolve income tax levels is a step which has major constitutional and economic ramifications for the entire Union, upon which the peoples of England,Wales and Northern Ireland have a right to be consulted.’

Under reforms in the recently passed Scotland Act, members of the Scottish parliament will soon take control of a 10p share of income tax, with a corresponding cut in the block grant from Westminster.
