Hibs have confirmed the club is in ‘complex negotiations’ over a restructuring of its £5.5million debt.

The Easter Road outfit insisted that talk of a ‘total’ debt write-off was ‘not based on fact’ and was ‘speculative’ but it is understood discussions between the club, the holding company and the bank centre on significantly reducing Hibs’ arrears.

As the Easter Road club announced a later-than-usual annual general meeting date, however, chief executive Leeann Dempster insisted a deal to place the club in the black is not close.

Normally held in November, the club AGM will now take place on January 28 to allow talks between Hibs, the club’s bank and HFC Holdings to continue to take place on debt restructuring.

HFC Holdings are Sir Tom Farmer’s company, through which the Kwik Fit chief executive owns the Easter Road club. The 74-year-old tycoon bought Hibs in 1990 to avoid a hostile takeover bid by ex-Hearts chief Wallace Mercer.

In a brief statement issued on Tuesday night on the club website, chief executive Dempster confirmed talks have been ongoing ‘for some time’ and ‘have focused on the club’s long-term future’.

She added: ‘Discussions have taken place involving the club, HFC Holdings and the bank. We have decided to hold the AGM slightly later than usual in order to allow these talks to be concluded. The outcome will be reflected in the board’s plans for the future which we will present at the AGM and talk in detail to our supporters.’

The club's relegation under Terry Butcher sparked a year of fan unrest at Easter Road

In the last set of published club accounts, up to July 2013, Hibs’ net debt stood at £5.5m. But HFC Holdings Ltd boast substantial assets in the form of Easter Road and the club’s East Mains training centre.

The Hibs debt restructuring talks come at the end of a year of fan unrest sparked by the club’s dismal relegation under Terry Butcher. The backlash led to supporter consortium BuyHibs being formed to try to raise cash to launch a buyout not dissimilar to the way The Foundation of Hearts (FoH) are funding their takeover of the Tynecastle club aided by the wealth of IT tycoon Ann Budge.

In their brief statement, the club added: ‘Hibernian FC today announced that the AGM for shareholders will take place on January 28. This will allow complex negotiations between the club, the holding company and the bank to be concluded.

‘The talks have been ongoing for some time, and have focused on the club’s long-term future. Media reports of a total debt write-off are not based on fact, and are speculative.’

A debt-free Hibs would clearly be more attractive should Farmer wish to sell his 90-per-cent share but he has maintained his stance that any new owners would have to be ‘right’ for the club.

Having rescued the Easter Road outfit from the clutches of an unwanted takeover by Hearts’ Wallace Mercer and the brink of receivership in 1990, Farmer has talked of saving the club for the local community and is said to be keen to leave a ‘legacy’.

Whether this includes selling his stake remains to be seen but one report yesterday put Edinburgh-born businessman Richard Skellett in pole position to take over the club should the 74-year-old Farmer wish to sell up.

The CEO and chairman of Allied Worldwide, an IT managed services company based in High Wycombe near London, Skellett is said to have been involved in discussions with Hibs for the last two years and was pictured at Easter Road for the Edinburgh derby against Hearts in October.

In February this year, Dundee United announced they had cleared their £3m bank debts in a restructuring deal. Then in March, Kilmarnock had £9.4m cleared from the club’s liabilities. And last month, Aberdeen revealed that a £14.5m debt to Willie and Elaine Donald had been wiped from the club’s ledger.
