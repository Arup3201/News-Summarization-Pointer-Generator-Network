Crystal Palace inflicted more pain on Liverpool at Selhurst Park with a convincing come-from-behind victory against Brendan Rodgers' out-of-form side.

Goals from Dwight Gayle, Joe Ledley and Mile Jedinak gave Neil Warnock's men a thoroughly deserved three points after Rickie Lambert had given the visitors the lead with his first goal for the Reds.

Sportsmail's Neil Ashton rates all the players' performances.

CRYSTAL PALACE

Julian Speroni - 7

Looked comfortable and assured throughout. Came to collect second half crosses.

Martin Kelly - 7

Wakey, wakey. Lost Lambert in the second minute when he pulled wide to meet Lallana’s angled ball. Improved after that, had to.

Damien Delaney - 6

Taken off with a leg injury after 36 minutes. Not the type to go off unless something serious.

Scott Dann - 7.5

Excellent. Has always looked the part at the centre of Palace’s defence, none more so than on Sunday afternoon.

Joel Ward - 7

Palace persist with playing a right back at left back. Steady, made a couple of decent runs.

Joe Ledley - 7.5

Terrific run into the box for Palace’s second. Top class performance.

Mile Jedinak - 8.5 

Best player on the pitch again - by an absolute mile . Steady, calming influence on the team. He is their leader. Free-kick was outstanding.

Yannick Bolasie - 7.5

Direct, electrifying runs, terrorised Liverpool’s defence whenever he was on the ball. Has become a shoot on sight merchant.

Marouane Chamakh - 7

Nice clever link up play. Another classy performance, vastly under-rated in this team.

Jason Puncheon - 6

Solid down the right, eventually made way for James McArthur.

Dwight Gayle - 7

Four in three against Liverpool, loves playing against them after his double here in last season’s 3-3. Uncanny knack of being in the right place.

SUBS

Brede Hangeland (Delaney 36) - 7 

Replaced Delaney before half-time. Steady, reliable. Booked.

James McArthur (Puncheon 76) - 6 

Provided a bit of energy.

Barry Bannan (Bolasie 86) - 6

Brought on when Bolasie’s legs had gone. 6

Subs not used: Hennessy, Campbell, Zaha, Johnson, McArthur, Bannan.

Booked: Hangeland. 

Manager: Neil Warnock - 8 

One look at his reaction to Palace’s second and third goals says it all.

LIVERPOOL

Simon Mignolet - 6 

Very, very good save from Gayle’s deft header after half hour. No chance with Palace leveller or winner.

Javier Manquillo - 4

Could not have looked worse if he had tried. Dreadful performance.

Dejan Lovren - 5

A soldier last season at the heart of Southampton’s defence. Something bad has happened to him judging by Palace's decisive goal.

Martin Skrtel - 5

Booked for pushing his arm across Chamakh. Another average defensive performance.

Glen Johnson - 4

Looks like a world beater one minute, a panel beater the next. Awful. 4

Liverpool defender Glen Johnson had an afternoon to forget in his side's 3-1 defeat to Crystal Palace

Joe Allen - 5

Credit to the little fella because he battled on after a nasty cut to the head. What does he do though? It is hard to say.

Steven Gerrard - 5 

Couple of nice passes, prodded, poked and pushed the ball around. Lacked dynamism.

Adam Lallana - 6

Pitching wedge into Lambert was schooled at Southampton. Industrious after that. Substituted. 

Raheem Sterling - 6

Losing his way fast in this ill-disciplined Liverpool team. Another young player in need of a rest.

Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling put in another disappointing display against Warnock's side on Sunday

Philippe Coutinho - 6

Early flourish, lost his mojo. Didn’t appear to be playing in the second half.

Rickie Lambert - 7

Stunning start when the old Southampton one-two worked with Lallana. Spilled his guts for the team.

SUBS 

Fabio Borini (Lallana 72) - 5.5

Brought on to try to make a different up front when Liverpool were struggling to provide service.

Emre Can (Allen 74) - 5 

Did absolutely nothing. 

Subs not used: Jones, Toure, Moreno, Leiva, Markovic.

Booked: Skrtel, Manquillo. 

Manager: Brendan Rodgers - 5
