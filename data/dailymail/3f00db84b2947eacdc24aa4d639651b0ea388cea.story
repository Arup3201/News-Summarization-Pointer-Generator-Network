Pressure was growing on England rugby captain Mike Tindall last night after a criminal charge was levelled at a nightclub bouncer who blew the whistle on his evening out with a mystery blonde in New Zealand.

Jonathan Dixon – who uploaded CCTV security video on to YouTube showing Zara Phillips’s husband kissing and cuddling the woman in Queenstown last Sunday – was arrested and charged with accessing a computer system for dishonest purposes.

The arrest of the burly 40-year-old bouncer raises the prospect of a highly embarrassing court case in New Zealand that could overshadow England’s World Cup campaign.

Dixon told The Mail on Sunday that he 
uploaded the footage from security computers at the Altitude bar because
he was outraged by Tindall’s ‘sleazy’ behaviour. Dixon was released on 
bail and will reappear in court in Queenstown tomorrow morning.

As well as a distraction for the 
England team, Dixon’s court appearance could coincide uncomfortably with
Ms Phillips’s imminent arrival in New Zealand to support her husband in
the latter stages of the tournament.

Dixon said last night: ‘If my case 
goes to trial, I want Mike Tindall to appear in the witness box and 
explain his actions that night.’

Tindall's father Phil said his son had spoken to him and reassured him that everything was okay.

Mr Tindall said his son told him the woman involved in the bar incident was a good friend and that he was focusing on the rugby.

'It’s all just a fuss over nothing, which has only happened ­because of who Mike is married to.' he told the Sunday Mirror.

'I’ve seen the pictures and must say I don’t recognise the girl in the footage at all, but I’ve been told she’s a friend and I know nothing untoward would have happened.'

Mr Tindall said his son made no mention of his new wife during their conversation. Meanwhile, fresh witnesses to 
Tindall’s liaison with the blonde have revealed lurid new details of his
antics, which cast serious doubts over claims in Britain that Ms 
Phillips is ‘relaxed’ about his account of the night out.

A spokesman for Ms Phillips has 
described the woman as a friend of the couple who has known Tindall 
since university days and who was at their wedding in July. But the 
Queen’s 30-year-old granddaughter struggled to put on a brave face as 
she competed in a three-day equestrian event in Ireland this weekend.

Despite the spokesman’s implication 
that ¬Tindall was indulging in a spot of harmless horseplay with an old 
pal, witnesses standing close to the couple in the Altitude bar 
described his approach to her as ‘overtly sexual’.

Tindall, 32, had been drinking with 
other members of the England team in another bar last Sunday, the day 
after their narrow victory over Argentina, before they arrived at the 
Altitude. The captain had already posed for pictures with rugby fans, 
including pretty Janine Jefferis, who is not the girl he was seen with 
at the Altitude.

There the players drank shots and 
beers, surrounded by crowds of admirers including a number of young 
women. The other team members gradually melted away, leaving Tindall, 
the blonde and a female friend of the blonde near the nightclub bar at 
around 1.30am.

Of the other players, only veteran 
hooker Steve Thompson remained, standing apart from Tindall and the 
blonde, downing rounds with rugby-loving customers all too eager to buy 
him drinks.

Six security cameras around the club 
picked up incriminating but soundless images of Tindall and the blonde 
becoming increasingly intimate. Witnesses standing close to them said 
the England captain’s intentions were clear.

‘There was no doubt what he was 
after,’ said one witness. ‘At one stage he put his hand down the back of
her jeans. Then he put his hand up her top at the back, as if he was 
trying to undo her bra strap.’

Tindall repeatedly tried to persuade 
the blonde to leave the bar with him, the witness said. ‘He was trying 
to drag her out of the door by the arm but she pulled free and said to 
him jokingly, “You’re married.” ’

It was at this point that CCTV cameras
filmed the couple cuddling beside the doors before the woman pulled 
Tindall towards her chest and kissed his shaved head. The witness said 
the couple then kissed each other on the lips.

The witness added: ‘He appeared a 
little unsteady on his feet but he kept insisting and pulling on her 
arm. She eventually gave in and walked out of the bar with him. Her 
female friend followed behind.’

Tindall’s behaviour in the street 
outside was even more mystifying for someone sup¬posedly enjoying the 
company of a platonic friend.

At the end of the silent video footage
of Tindall and the blonde posted on YouTube, the player can be seen 
talking briefly to a passer-by outside the bar.

A second witness told The Mail on 
Sunday that the footage actually shows Tindall being confronted by a 
male Australian tourist who recognised him and said: ‘You’re married. 
Pull your head in, mate.’

The witness said: ‘Someone, I’m not 
sure if it was Tindall, said, “What goes on tour, stays on tour.” 
Tindall seemed to stumble forward towards the tourist before he was 
quickly pulled away by the girl and her friend.

‘After that, Tindall and the blonde walked away from the bar with their arms around each other.’

The blonde’s friend was walking behind
as the couple left the Altitude at around 2am, but was nowhere to be 
seen an hour later when a separate witness saw Tindall and the blonde 
walk hand in hand past another bar about 500 yards away. ‘There was no 
one else with them,’ the witness said. ‘I didn’t see where they went.’

Before reporting for a pre-arranged 
interview at Queenstown police station yesterday, Dixon, who has worked 
as a bouncer around New Zealand for 20 years, said that he had put the 
CCTV footage on the internet partly because he believed Tindall’s 
behaviour had insulted the Royal Family.

‘That kind of behaviour is completely 
wrong,’ said Dixon, who was contacted by police after the owner of the 
Altitude made a formal complaint about footage from its security cameras
being uploaded on to YouTube.

‘In New Zealand we have two national 
anthems – God Defend New Zealand and God Save The Queen. The Queen is in
our national anthem and she is on our bank notes. She’s not just your 
Queen – she’s our Queen too. This is the man who has just married the 
Queen’s granddaughter and I thought his behaviour was sleazy.’

Dixon, who had been working at another
bar in Queenstown earlier last Sunday night, said he was called to the 
Altitude at 11.30pm to ‘beef up’ security after the England team 
arrived. He left at 1.30am and said he saw ‘nothing untoward’ in 
Tindall’s behaviour up to that point, although he was with the blonde. 
It wasn’t until the next morning that he heard from amazed colleagues 
that the couple had become intimate shortly after he left.

Dixon said he obtained the CCTV 
footage from the Altitude computer banks the next day. Later, he was 
contacted by a British newspaper which published a story about the 
episode without any of the footage. Dixon received no payment for the 
article.

Just good friends: The girl - seemingly kissing Tindall's forehead - is a friend of the couple and was at their wedding, a spokesman for Zara said

Early on Friday, keen to see the 
footage aired, Dixon uploaded it on to YouTube, ensuring that it was 
seen by millions of people worldwide within hours.

In a foretaste of what he may argue at
his court case, Dixon said: ‘It’s not that I’m the most moral person in
the world, but I have a conscience and I was raised well, and I didn’t 
like what I saw. Anyone who does this kind of thing when they’ve made 
wedding vows in front of God should be ashamed of themselves.

‘I wanted to tell him, “Mr Tindall, you did something really wrong, not just to your wife but to your nation.”

‘I knew there was no chance of me ever
standing in front of Tindall and giving him a piece of my mind about 
his conduct, so I decided to put it on YouTube so that everyone could 
see it and form their own opinion.

‘I think that everyone who sees it 
will think the same as I do: how can you do this? She’s your wife and 
she’s the Queen’s granddaughter. If this had involved a Maori queen, she
would have cut off his head.’

Dixon scoffed at the claims that the 
blonde was a friend of Tindall and Ms Phillips, saying: ‘If that’s true,
Zara should get rid of her friend. I wouldn’t have a friend like that, 
and if she is a friend of hers, Zara is hanging around with the wrong 
people.

‘What amazes me is that no one was 
stopping Tindall. He’s the captain of the England team but no one was 
keeping an eye on him. If I had seen anything going on, I would have 
stopped him. I would have gone up to him and told him to watch himself.

‘I’ve heard that some British people who were in Queenstown that night saw him and they were disgusted at what they saw.’

Dixon, who is 6ft 6in tall and weighs 
19st 7lb compared with 6ft 1in Tindall’s 16st 9lb, added: ‘If the Queen 
wants someone to give him a hiding, she should give me a call.’

The blonde seen with Tindall last 
Sunday night is described by Ms Phillips’s spokesman as an English 
friend living in Australia who was on holiday at the time of the 
incident. She is now believed to be back in Australia..
