A 450lbs white rapper from Antioch, Tennessee, is regretting borrowing his favorite restaurant’s logo for the cover of latest mixtape after Waffle House sent him a cease and desist letter for infringing their copyright. 

Jason DeFord aka Jelly Roll jokingly describes himself as ‘a regular fat piece of white trash’ and claims to have visited the food chain hundreds of times.

Earlier this year, he recorded a 21-track mixtape which he called ‘Whiskey, Weed & Waffle House’, in tribute to three of his favorite things.

Waffle House blues: Rapper Jelly Roll has been a loyal customer for years but that didn't stop the company suing him for copyright infringement

He printed up 10,000 copies to give away, with a front cover featuring a bottle of Crown Royal whiskey, a pot leaf and Waffle House’s distinct logo.

The back-cover design even looked like the chain’s menu.

Unfortunately Waffle House didn’t appreciate the homage and within a month 28-year-old Jelly Roll had received a cease and desist letter from their lawyers.

The heavyweight rapper was ordered to destroy everything featuring the company’s name and logo within 10 days for infringing their corporate trademark. 

Lawyers for the food chain were quick to hit aspiring rapper Jelly Roll with a series of charges after he used their logo on his mixtape cover as a tribute to his favorite eatery

The company also filed a trademark claim that shut him out of his Facebook and YouTube accounts for more than a week.

Initially flattered by all the attention from his favorite eatery, it took a visit to a lawyer for Jelly Roll to realize the severity of the situation.

The thoughtless homage has left him picking up a very expensive check and he estimates that he’s lost more than $10,000 so far, including scrapping a video shot at a Nashville Waffle House and $500 every time his lawyer communicates with the chain.

Yet despite being on the receiving end the company’s strong-arm tactics Jelly Roll confesses that he hasn't been able to stop eating at his local Waffle House.

Jelly Roll called his mixtape 'Whiskey, Weed & Waffle House' in tribute to three of his favorite things

‘I swore I wouldn't tell too many people - I promise you're the only reporter I’ll tell - I just ate at a Waffle House! Even after I vowed I'd never eat at one again, I found myself hungry at an odd hour, under the intoxication of a little whiskey and a little weed, and I wound up in a Waffle House,’ he confessed to Gawker.

The incident has brought Jelly Roll a lot of undue stress, but he has gotten through tougher situation in his 28 years including going to prison for drugs possession.

The father-of-one has even made able to make light of the situation.

‘I'm 450 pounds - I should have sued Waffle House 10 years ago! Do you know how many All-Star Breakfasts I bought in my life? I might’ve stopped at 330!’ he joked.
