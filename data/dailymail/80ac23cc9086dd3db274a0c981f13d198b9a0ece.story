US Vice President Joe Biden today raised fresh concerns about Britain leaving the European Union as he flew into meet David Cameron and Nick Clegg.

Mr Biden arrived in Downing Street on the last leg of a tour of Europe, and attended meetings with the two coalition party leaders.

The prospect of closer trade links between the EU and the US was on the agenda after Mr Cameron’s promise of an in-out referendum raised fears in the White House that America’s closest ally was risking severing ties with Brussels.

The two men discussed the prospect of a trade deal between the US and the European Union, amid concern in the White House that Britain could sever ties with Brussels

Mr Biden said the White House view was that the UK was ‘stronger as a result of its membership’ of the EU.

‘And we believe the EU is stronger with the UK's involvement,’ he said in an interview with The Times.

Last month President Barack Obama told Mr Cameron that the US ‘values a strong UK in a strong European Union’.

Mr Clegg did not mention the issue directly as he welcomed Mr Biden to Number 10 - though he did hail the prospect on progress towards a US/EU trade deal.

Mr Biden also met Deputy PM Nick Clegg, and joked that the pair usually only see each other via video calls

Mr Clegg told Mr Biden: ‘It’s great to see you again. We’re going to discuss a lot of things.

'Foreign policy challenges which we share and work together on, whether it’s our common endeavour in Afghanistan, the challenges in north Africa, the issue of Iran or the urgent and ongoing need to make progress on the Middle East peace process.

‘And also we’ll be discussing the prospects for a transatlantic free trade agreement between Europe – the EU – and the United States, which is something that has been talked about a lot for many, many years, but it’s been an elusive project to get going.

‘But if we can work together to overcome the obstacles on both sides of the Atlantic, I’m absolutely sure that it will be, we’re all sure it will be something that will create a significant boost to prosperity and jobs on both sides of the Atlantic.’

Mr Biden joked about his swearing in as Vice President for a second time, telling Mr Cameron: 'It was easy, nothing to it'

Asked whether Mr Cameron would use the opportunity of today's visit to outline his position on Europe to the vice president, the PM's official spokesman said: ‘They will certainly be discussing EU/US trade.

‘As I understand it, the US position that the administration has expressed is a strong, outward-looking EU with a strong Britain inside that. That is very much our position.’

On international issues, the PM and vice president were expected to ‘discuss our shared agenda around international co-operation and how the UK and US continue to work closely together on a whole series of issues’, said the spokesman.

Mr Biden joked that he usually only spoke to his British counterpart via video phone.

‘We spend more time looking at each other in the situation room on cameras and on video talking to each other than we get to do in person,’ he said.

‘We’ve established a great relationship and as you all know, the most open relationship we have with any nation in the world is with Great Britain, and we do have a lot to discuss because we both have a lot to say in the areas you mentioned.’

He said Mr Obama ‘sends his best’ to Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg.

Mr Biden was last month sworn in as vice president to Barack Obama, who saw off Republican challenger Mitt Romney to return to the White House.

‘So you signed up for another four years?’ Mr Cameron was heard to say as the pair entered Downing Street's White Room for talks.

‘We did, we did. It was easy, nothing to it,’ Mr Biden replied.
