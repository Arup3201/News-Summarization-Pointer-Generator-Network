He may have been stopped in his tracks as a globe-trotting trade ambassador after a string of scandals.

But Prince Andrew, it seems, has high hopes for his two daughters instead.

Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie are, remarkably, to represent the British Government this week as part of a high-profile trade delegation to Germany.

High hopes: Prince Andrew (centre) wants his daughters Princesses Beatrice (right) and Eugenie (left) to carry out public duties on behalf of the country

The sisters, aged 24 and 22, will be driving a Union Jack-branded Mini – reminiscent of Michael Caine in the Italian Job - through the streets of Berlin to launch the GREAT Britain campaign in the country.

Although they have no formal role as yet, a spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office indicated yesterday that the princesses could now be seen more and more on the international stage.

‘The princesses are fifth and sixth in line to the throne and are now part of that group of royals who are willing to go out and lend their support to the UK.

‘This is their first official international event but it has been made clear that they are willing to do this in the future which is great news for us.

‘They are young, interesting and cool and this particular event has a young, fashionable flavour. We are delighted they are taking part.’

A source close to the sisters stressed, however, that both had made clear their intention to become ‘modern royals’ – having their own jobs and incomes but taking part in charitable or national initiatives when required.

Role: The pair will drive an eye-catching and iconic Mini from Brandenburg Gate through Berlin before attending a fashion fair as part of the launch of the GREAT Britain campaign in the country

The Mail understands that although 
they were asked by the Government to take part, Prince Andrew is funding
the cost of their trip personally.

The girls will be flying out on standard economy tickets.

It is an unlikely pairing as neither 
of the girls carry out on public duties on behalf of the country, 
despite being fifth and sixth in line to the throne.

But
the Mail understands that their father has been fighting something of a
‘rear-guard’ action for them to represent the Royal Family in the 
future, despite Prince Charles’s plans for a slimmed-down monarchy when 
he eventually accedes to the throne.

This
week’s event, which starts in Berlin on Thursday, will be the first 
time that the sisters have actually represented the nation in any 
official capacity.

A Buckingham Palace 
spokesman said they were hand-picked by the Prime Minister’s office at 
Downing Street to attend, saying: ‘Number Ten asked them to take part.’

The pair will drive their eye-catching and iconic Mini from the historic Brandenburg Gate through the German capital before attending a fashion fair entitled ‘Bread & Butter’, featuring home-grown brands such as Superdry.

Thursday also marks the 50th anniversary of the signing o f the Élysée Treaty, signed on January 22nd, 1963, which marked a new era of friendship between France and Germany and therefore Britain.

Afterwards the princesses will pop into the KaDeWe department story to learn how British companies are exporting to Germany and beyond. The textile industry contributes around £20billion to the UK economy each year and employs some 816,000 people.

They will also visit the headquarters of German online shop Zalando, which recently set up an office in London, where they will ‘discuss the latest trends in e-commerce and expansion strategies’, according to the British Embassy in Berlin.

The following day the princesses' focus
will shift to ‘heritage and knowledge’ with a visit to Hanover, where 
they will, perhaps more appropriately, attend the re-opening of 
Herrenhausen Palace.

The 
UK’s links with Hanover date back to the 18th century when 
Prince-Elector Georg Ludwig of Hanover succeeded Queen Anne to become 
King George 1 of Great Britain and Ireland.

Just how and why the Government feels that Beatrice and Eugenie are qualified for their new role is not entirely clear.

The GREAT Britain campaign is a cross-department initiative designed to use the platform of the Royal Wedding, Olympic Games and Queen’s Diamond Jubilee to showcase Britain’s capabilities abroad, promoting it as a country to visit, live, work, study, invest in and do business with.

No-one would comment on whether the Prince lobbied for his daughters to take centre stage at the Berlin event, but Andrew’s old colleagues at UK Trade and Industry are heavily involved and the entire campaign is being co-ordinated by officials at Downing Street.

Aides said the Princesses' visit was designed to highlight Britain’s capabilities in the areas of fashion, technology and tradition.

But while Princess Beatrice has certainly won praise from fashionistas after losing about two stone in weight and overhauling her wardrobe with the help of a stylist in recent years, she was, nevertheless, ridiculed for her choice of Philip Treacy hat to the 2011 royal wedding which was variously likened to a toilet seat and a pretzel.

While Prince Andrew is reportedly keen for his daughters to take a more active role, their mother has also indicated that they would be taking on more public duties

The princess had the last laugh, though, when it was sold for a staggering £81,000 for charity.

She
is currently working for a venture capital firm in London and has taken
two days annual leave to undertake this week’s engagements.

Eugenie has yet to find a full-time job after graduating from university last year.

A
Buckingham Palace spokesman said yesterday: ‘It is something of a one 
off but when Number Ten asked they were delighted to attend’.

Last year their mother, Sara, Duchess of York, indicated her daughters would be taking on more public duties.

'The girls are going nice and slow, they're coming out, they're doing great works with charity,’ she said.

'I think eventually people will realise that they're taking mini steps and they're doing a great job for Britain.'

Their father, Prince Andrew, repeatedly waded into controversy during his tenure as the UK’s Special representative for International Trade and Investment, an unpaid position he took on in 2001.

Not only was he accused of wasting taxpayers money on chartering private jets and other five star luxury travel trappings, the prince was also the subject of scrutiny amid fears he was ‘cashing-in’ on connections he developed with wealthy trading partners.

The sale of his home, Sunninghill, for £3million over the asking price – despite it languishing on the market for more than five years -  to a controversial Kazakhstan tycoon was particularly controversial.

The buyer of the £15million property was Timur Kylibayev, son in law of the oil-rich region’s controversial president, whom Andrew met with several times through his official role and even joined on goose-hunting expeditions. The prince has always denied any impropriety.

The final nail in the coffin came when he was photographed walking through Central Park New York with his close friend, financier Jeffrey Epstein, after the billionaire was released from jail for soliciting prostitution from underage girls.

The resulting furore so tarnished Andrew’s reputation that in July 2011 he announced he was standing down as an official trade ambassador.
