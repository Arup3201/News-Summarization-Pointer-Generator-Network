With hundreds of proudly displayed taxidermed beasts adorning the walls this may look like the homestead ranch of a Montana hunter - but in fact it is the two bedroom Manhattan home of a New York socialite he has dubbed the 'Animal House'.

Regardless of its very urban location and erudite curator, Gregory Speck's collection is quite possibly one of the largest in the world and is valued at upwards of $1 million.

Indeed, 61-year-old Speck is willing to listen to offers for his impressive troupe which stands at 500 strong now that he is selling his luxury $3.4 million apartment which overlooks Central Park.

However, that has provided his realtor with a slight headache as they try to find a buyer for the apartment willing to take on the fixed taxidermed models.

In fact the apartment is so dominated by the stuffed animals that the realtor has produced a specially created online listing that shows two sets of photos.

One shows the apartment as it currently is with the taxidermy, while the other has edited the animals out, 'so prospective buyers can get a sense of the grandeur of the apartment.'

Robert Dowling of Halstead Property said, 'It’s a fantastic opportunity to buy a home at the Beresford, an iconic New York City landmark, one of the most prestigious addresses in the city.'

Speck, who describes himself as a Manhattan socialite, celebrity journalist and author has lived at the luxurious Beresford co-op at 211 Central Park for 36-years and began amassing his enormous taxidermy collection in the early 1990s.

He is not a hunter and never has been, rather he has scoured museums, stuffed road kill and even found pieces in a country-western disco.

Splitting his collection equally between his Manhattan apartment and Harrisonburg, Virginia, house, Speck spent roughly $50,000 on his hobby over the course of three years.

Hanging from every corner and standing in every available space in his apartment are stuffed turkeys, elk heads mounted on the walls, cougars and standing black and grizzly bears looking fearsome.

According to The New York Times, the collection held in Speck's Manhattan apartment could fill an entire hall at the American Museum of Natural History.

In one of the bedrooms a swan appears to float off away from its ceiling mount and a bison head that Speck found in a supermarket freezer in Virginia is in the other bedroom.

'He was the wooliest bully I had ever seen, so I called him Buffalo Bill,' said Speck to The New York Times.

In between his incredible array of stuffed animals, Speck exhibits pictures of himself with Hollywood stars such as Audrey Hepburn and artists like Andy Warhol.

Deciding to leave his Manhattan home following the death of his wife in 1999, Speck amassed the collection because he is a lifelong animal lover who grew up wanting to own a zoo.

He considers his taxidermy collection 'an educational zoological display' and has decided that the apartment can be bought with or without the collection.

Explaining why he spent so little on a collection that is now valuable, Speck recalled that in the 1990s, taxidermy was considered so out of fashion as to be offensive.

'In the ’90s, it was politically incorrect to have taxidermy specimens for various reasons,' he said to The New York Times.

'I found I was able to acquire many museum-quality trophies for very little because people didn’t want them.'

Speck's collection includes Kodiak bears, two moose mounts, a black bear, freshwater game fish, bobcats, lynxes, raccoons, turkeys, rattlesnakes and even 40 Asiatic male pheasants in 'full plumage.'

He would rather that one person or institution took them on and jokingly described them as 'very well behaved.'

'I would rather find somebody that would be so amazed that I’ve done this collection who would want them kept together as a big family,' he said.
