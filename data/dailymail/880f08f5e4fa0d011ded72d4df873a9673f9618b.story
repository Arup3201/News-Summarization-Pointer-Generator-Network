Apple will adopt a brand new design of SIM card, according to the latest leak which comes just six days before the launch of the highly-anticipated iPhone 5.

The SIM card is the small plastic card that comes within all phones, and allows your phone to 'hand-shake' with your network.

Now Apple will use Nano-SIMs, according to leaked images by ifun.de, which claims shops in Germany have already received batches of iPhone 5 SIM cards.

This implies the iPhone 5, expected to be announced on September 12, is just weeks away from shipping.

Smaller than ever: The iPhone's SIM - which connects you to the phone network - has gone from full size (right) to micro-sized (also right) to Nano (left)

iFun reports that German T-Mobile 
stores have received the cards within the last few days, with letters 
informing staff that the chips are for 'the latest generation of smartphones' expected 'in the near future'.

As it happens, for the foreseeable future, Apple is the one company expected to be using Nano SIMs.

When mobile phones first arrived, the SIM cards were credit-card-sized, but they have shrunk over the last two decades.

Apple was the first to use the current microsim size, introduced with the iPhone 4.

Shrinking the SIM card brings many 
advantages to the company - for space is at a premium for any device 
that wants to remain slim, yet pack in all the features - from decent 
camera to large battery - that smartphone users expect.

The invite: Apple's minimalist invitation asks people to attend the San Francisco launch event on the 12th - and the shadow of a five forms underneath

The little piece of plastic, with a 
chip embedded inside, handles the logins and security to connect your 
phone to the phone and data networks. Without it, a phone is effectively
blind, unable to make or receive calls and texts.

Micro-SIMs came into fashion last 
year, shaving precious millimeters from the larger form, and Nano-SIMs 
will take this one step further.

A Micro-SIM comes in at 15 x 12 x 
0.76 mm, whereas the Nano SIM is 12.3 x 8.8 x 0.67 mm, which is about 40
per cent smaller in area.

The chip itself remains the same size, but the plastic which acts as a buffer for the chip has been pared right back.

Old versus new: The newer model (on the left) have a smaller, one-piece design

Despite the tide of speculation, the 
iPhone 5 is still not actually confirmed by Apple. But it is effectively
beyond doubt that the iPhone 5 will be announced on September 12.

Apple has an annual refresh rate for their smartphone, traditionally unveiling it each September for a launch in October.

Four months ago, spec sheets and 
components began leaking from various suppliers, and over the last few 
weeks these have intensified.

Well-known companies such as Sharp and Samsung are known to have large orders for Apple's next devices.

The September 12th date has been 
rumoured since June, and this was confirmed by Apple on Monday, when it 
sent a 'Save the Date' invite out to tech journalists.

Buried within a shadow on the 
invitation, a subtle '5' - the only word (or in this case, a number) to 
come from Apple about their future plans.

In other recent leaks, Vietnamese 
blogsite Tinhte.vn posted a video of what it claims are newly-designed 
headphones for the next iPhone, which is expected to launch on September
12.

If confirmed, it 
is the first major redesign of the distinctive white headphones since 
the iPhone launched, other than the addition of an in-line microphone 
and remote control in 2008.

The headphones, which come bundled with iPods and iPhones,
are one of the most iconic parts of Apple's product line-up, and are 
perhaps most famous for appearing in the famous 'dancing silhouettes' 
adverts for the iPod.

The iPhone is also due for a 
controversial re-design to its dock connector, which will break 
compatibility with older peripherals and cables, although an adapter is 
expected to become available.
