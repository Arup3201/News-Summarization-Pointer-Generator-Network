Suspect: This booking photo released by the Volusia County Division of Corrections shows Ebony Wilkerson, 32, who is accused of driving a minivan carrying her three young children into the ocean in an attempt to kill them

The pregnant South Carolina mother who drove a minivan containing her three children into the ocean in Florida has been arrested and charged with attempted murder, investigators said Friday.

The woman, 32-year-old Ebony Wilkerson, from Cross, South Carolina, was booked into Volusia County Jail after undergoing a mental evaluation in a hospital Thursday. Her children are currently in state custody. 

Volusia County Sheriff Ben Johnson announced this afternoon that Wilkerson is facing three counts of first-degree attempted murder and three counts of aggravated child abuse involving great injury.

‘She did intentionally try to kill the children,’ the sheriff’s told reporters during the press conference. 

Wilkerson made international headlines Tuesday when she drove her minivan into the ocean on a Florida beach with her three children, ages three, nine and 10, in the car.

Good Samaritans and lifeguards came to the kids' rescue, rushing into the water to remove them from the vehicle as it filled with water.

In
 response to questions about Wilkerson’s mental state, the sheriff 
stated Friday that investigators have found no information suggesting 
that the suspect was suffering from any psychiatric or emotional issues.

Johnson
 explained that the decision to charge Wilkerson in connection to the 
incident was based on several factors, including interviews with 
witnesses and the woman’s own children, who told deputies that their 
mother drove the minivan straight into the surf.

Johnson added that when questioned by police, Wilkerson claimed that she had tried to drive out of the ocean, but eyewitnesses insisted that she was going in the opposite direction and then tried to hamper the rescue efforts, suggesting intent to kill them.

‘She tried to stop one of the beach rangers from getting into the window,’ Johnson said.

The sheriff also revealed that Wilkerson's young son tried to fight his mother in a bid to gain control of the steering wheel.

‘She actually told them, "close their eyes and go to sleep, mama's taking him to a better place,"' the law enforcement official told the press.

Wilkerson, who is 27 and a half weeks pregnant with her fourth child, was described by officials as calm, cooperative and 'very lucid.'

Wilkerson was stopped in her vehicle by police officers two hours before she 
drove into the ocean. Her sister called police worried since Wilkerson 
had been talking about demons.

The officers found her lucid and let her go, Police Chief Mike Chitwood said.

According
 to Wilkerson's sister, Jessica Harrell, the 32-year-old woman was 
trying to escape from an abusive spouse when she drove from her home in 
South Carolina to stay with her in Florida. 

'Her
 husband beat on her, so she came down to my house from South Carolina,'
 said Jessica Harrell in a call to a 911 dispatcher just hours before 
Wilkerson attempted to end her life by driving her minivan into the 
surf.

Harrell, 28, asked the
 operator to send officers to perform a welfare check because her 
sibling appeared emotionally distraught.

'She's
 talking about Jesus, that there are demons in my house, that I'm trying
 to control her, but I'm trying to keep them safe,' Harrell said on the 
call.

The woman revealed that she made an attempt to take Wilkerson to a hospital the day before, but the 32-year-old left.

When
 officers caught up with Wilkerson and interviewed her, the woman 
allegedly told them that she was heading to a shelter for abused women. 
She also added that she was going to her ‘safe place.’

Wilkerson
 was let go because she did not meet the criteria to be detained under 
the Florida Mental Health Act, which allows people to be involuntarily 
committed if they appear to present a danger to themselves.

In the 911 call, Jessica Harrell said that she had tried to take her sister to a shelter, but it had no vacancies.

Police in Myrtle Beach said Wilkerson filed the domestic violence report March 1, accusing her husband of sexually assaulting her.

Court records uncovered by the Post and Courier indicate that Wilkerson was married to Lutful Ronjon, 31, of Cross, who was arrested in May 2005 on domestic battery charges.

The report stated that Ronjon beat up his wife during an argument about receipts while the couple were vacationing in Myrtle Beach.

The battery charge was later dismissed after Ronjon underwent a domestic violence pre-trial service program. 

The Post and Courier in Charleston also found that Wilkerson was involved in a deadly crash in Delray in February 2007.

On
 the day of the accident, Wilkerson was going northbound on Interstate 
95 when she switched lanes and slammed into the rear of a Nissan 
operated by Douglas Krane, of Fort Lauderdale.

Pushing them away: Footage shows Wilkerson (on the far left) appear to push the lifeguard away from her door as she gets out of the car without being helped- but leaves her three children trapped inside

Running to the rescue: Three lifeguards helped the Good Samaritans and are seen trying to bring the car in from the surf after the children had been saved

What remained: Just moments after the children were taken out of the car, it flipped over completely and waves tore through it

Emergency responders: The Good Samaritans led the charge but then beach patrol took over

The
 impact sent Krane's car skidding across the road and into a concrete 
barrier. The driver's wife, Jennifer, suffered critical injuries in the 
collision and died several days later.

Wilkerson
 was cited for improper lane change, lost her license for a year and was
 ordered to serve 132 hours of community service, according to court 
records.

Witnesses to the dramatic rescue Tuesday reported hearing Wilkerson's children - 
two girls and a boy, aged three, nine and 10 - screaming that their 
mother was trying to kill them.

Two hours earlier, police officers stopped Wilkerson and questioned her at her sister's request.

'The children were in the back seat, 
they were buckled in and were not in distress. Although the sergeant 
said she looked like she had some mental illness, she did not fit the 
criteria for going into custody under the Baker Act.'

'If
 she made any statements that she was suicidal or homicidal officers 
would have taken her into custody,' said Volusia County Sheriff Ben 
Johnson.

Help: The woman's sister called police and 
warned them that she was talking about demons, prompting them to do a 
welfare check but they released her because she was lucid

The
 children were turned over to welfare authorities. Officials said they would be 
released to a relative in Orlando once released from Halifax Hospital
 where they are being treated for minor injuries.

Sheriff Ben Johnson said it's too early to say whether Wilkerson will 
face criminal charges.

'They have been through a very rough ordeal,' Florida Department of Chidren and Families spokesman John Harrell said.

'We would not want to have the children placed in an environment in which they would not be cared for.'

Tourists on the beach caught the horrifying ordeal on camera, and the footage shows that the 31-year-old mother was physically able to escape the vehicle.

In video taken by Simon Besner, a 
tourist from Canada, the woman can be seen outside the van as lifeguards
 try to pull her children from the vehicle.

Witnesses
 described her hopping out of the car window as her screaming children 
remained seat-belted in the back. Waves nearly pushed her 
under the van.

'It was a bit terrifying,' said Besner.

In the video, several men frantically 
try to get to the third and youngest child through the hatchback and the driver's 
side door as waves lap over the front of the minivan.

The small child is eventually pulled to safety.

Defending their actions: Sheriff Ben Johnson said that his deputies had to let her go because they had no legal justification to hold her

Another tourist described watching with horror.

'My
 friend pointed out that there was a car getting really close to the 
beach and actually started driving on the water,' Taylor Quintin 
visiting the area from Vermont told Local 6.

'I saw a kid in the back waving his arms around screaming, 'Help us! Help us!' And the car kept going deeper.'

'That's
 when I saw a guy from the beach run over next to the car and take out 
two small children and walk them back up. Another guy ran out and 
brought a little toddler out of the car'.

Many added that there was no way the incident was an accident.

'When she first was drifting into the ocean, we thought maybe an accident,' Donna Pratt told the broadcaster.
