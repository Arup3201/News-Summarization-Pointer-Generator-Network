British inventor Sir James Dyson has revealed he is working on an affordable robot to carry out chores around the house.

The entrepreneur said this week he will announce a £5 million investment in a new robotics laboratory at Imperial College London to develop the technology.

Sir James said soon a 'new generation of robot that understands the world around them will be able to clean the house, put out the bins and even keep an eye out for intruders'.

Sir James claims his firm currently competing with Japanese rivals to become the first to create an advanced generation of household robots.

Twendy-One, a humanoid robot that can 
help with housework and nursing care, has already been unveiled by 
Waseda University in Tokyo and will be on sale within a few years.

It has also been speculated that Google 
is building an android army after recently acquiring a number of robotic
 and artificial intelligence companies.

Sir James told MailOnline: 'Domestic use will be the initial focus of the research. What robots need to function in the home is vision and the ability to interact intelligently.'

Last year, Dyson launched a £150million facility full of robots - but Sir James admits they are inefficient: 'They perform precise, highly controlled movements in an environment that doesn’t change.

'In a complex environment – the home or garden – a machine must understand and perceive its environment. Such technology would have wide ranging application. This is a starting point, and we will have to see where it leads - and that is what's exciting.'

The £5million investment is crucial 
for the UK to catch up with markets in the US and Japan, where robots 
are already a growing commodity, Sir James claims.

He
 told MailOnline: 'The US and Japan are leading the charge. Always the 
early adopters, they aren't afraid of taking risks when it comes to new 
technology.

'They have seen the unprecedented potential in robotics and are actively investing in research and development.

'That
 doesn't mean to say we don't have the capability here in the UK. We 
have some of the World's leading Universities, brimming with brilliant 
minds.  And our digital motors are some of the smallest, most efficient 
motors in the world – they spin at over 110,000rpm.

'All it takes is time and funding. Combining these developments will lead to previously unthinkable technologies.'

He
 adds that the project is also aimed at rebooting Britain's dwindling 
engineering industry, a major stumbling block to the advance of 
robotics.

'We should be 
encouraging UK companies to invest in R&D and take on engineers so 
that they can grow and compete with the World's leading technology 
companies. Making the UK matter.

'Research and development is a slow burn. And time costs. Long-term thinking is essential to new technology.'

The
 move has sparked fears among critics who warn artificial intelligence 
is a slippery slope. But Sir James claims we have already crossed the 
threshold.

He told 
MailOnline: 'We already have robots all around us. And, if we are to 
compete with the likes of the US and Japan we have to take risks, 
explore the unexplored.

'The UK has a rich history of being the forerunner in new technology and we should endeavour to continue this trend.

'An
 important strand to what we are doing is working closely with British 
academia to apply research – to make sure British industry can turn 
ideas into tangible technologies.

'As
 long as Universities, the students in them, and industry continues to 
benefit and to progress then there is nothing to be fearful of.'
