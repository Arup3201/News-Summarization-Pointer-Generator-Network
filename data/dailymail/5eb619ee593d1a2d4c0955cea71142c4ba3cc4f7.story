Eight NHS workers are attacked every hour while doing their job, according to new figures which show a nine per cent increase in the number of assaults on employees.

The number of reported assaults on NHS staff in England rose from 63,199 in 2012/13 to 68,683 last year.

It means almost 200 workers are attacked every day, with the most violent or aggressive incidents taking place in A&E and mental health units, according to experts.

The number of reported assaults on NHS staff in England went up from 63,199 in 2012/13 to 68,683 last year

Last year, just 1,649 cases led to criminal sanctions – an increase of just 191 on the previous year.

Most of the attacks, which included punching, biting, kicking and even stabbings, occurred when staff were trying to treat or support patients.

Experts said the rising figures were 'absolutely shocking' and blamed increased waiting times and NHS cuts on the growing trend.

Richard Hampton, of NHS Protect which compiled the figures, said: 'No NHS staff should be physically assaulted and we encourage staff who are victims of violence to press charges against assailants.

'Those who work in the NHS have the right to provide care in a safe environment. Employers must do all they can to support staff in preventing incidents and pursuing offenders.'

Janet Davies, of the Royal College of Nursing, added: '68,000 is a huge number of physical assaults against NHS staff, even before you consider the rise of 5,000 in the past year.

'What's even more distressing is that this rise comes at a time when violent crime in the UK is on the decline.

'Sadly, our experience suggests that the assaults that have been reported may be the tip of an even larger iceberg.

'Apart from the pain and suffering, assaults against staff cost the NHS around £60million which could be better spent on improving patient care and providing faster treatment.'

Christina McAnea, head of health for UNISON which represents many NHS workers, said no one should feel unsafe at work.

She said: 'It is absolutely shocking that every day more than 188 NHS workers are physically attacked. The fact this figure is rising year-on-year should ring alarm bells.

'The cuts and pressure on the service have caused growing patient frustration but no staff should be assaulted or feel unsafe at work.

'There can be no excuse for abusing or assaulting staff and all incidents should be taken very seriously.

'Sadly, violence on NHS premises often go unreported and many workers are left to suffer in silence.

'The NHS must do its best to provide a safe working environment. Both employers and the police need to take these incidents seriously.'

The figures come as paramedic Richard Bentley spoke out about the violence he has experienced during his ten-year career on the frontline in the north of England.

The 31-year-old said over the last 12 months he has been threatened with a knife, as well as kicked and bitten by a patient while trying to give first aid.

He told The Mirror: 'You still don't expect the level of violence that we have to face.

'We have had stabbing cases where we've been told the perpetrator has gone. Then out of nowhere they're back and doing everything they can to stop us treating the patient.

'The job can get seriously dangerous'.

He said Saturday nights were often the worse for attacks on workers, describing them as 'particularly volatile' with alcohol being a 'huge contributing factor'. 

The NHS Protect figures revealed that the the highest number of attacks on ambulance services in England last year occurred in London.

Assaults on workers in the capital totalled 414, while attacks on paramedics working for the North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust stood at 377.

The fewest number of assaults on an ambulance service alone was in the North East, where there were 73 reported attacks last year.
