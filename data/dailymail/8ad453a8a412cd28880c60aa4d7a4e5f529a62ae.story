It has long been debated whether humans are responsible for the extinction of the woolly mammoth.

Now, a new study  suggests that hunting did significantly deplete mammoth populations in Western Europe around 30,000 years ago.

By studying the bones of mammoths, horses and reindeer, the experts ruled out climate change and food shortages as the reason for the population plunge.

Researchers from the University of Tübingen, Germany and the Senckenberg Nature Research Society in Frankfurt, analysed bones, teeth and mammoth ivory from the Gravettian era between 30,500 and 22,000 years ago.

They found that woolly mammoth numbers declined, but that climate conditions as well as food and water supplies for the giant herbivores remained stable.

The woolly cousins of modern elephants roamed northern Eurasia and North America beginning 300,000 years ago, but some 10,000 to 20,000 years ago, all but a few of the isolated island populations disappeared.

Since the 1700s scientists have debated what caused the demise of mammoths.

All but a few isolated island populations disappeared between 20,000 and 10,000 years ago.

One popular theory, bolstered by this study, is that Ice Age people hunted most of the mammoths out of existence.

However, some experts argue that global warming helped make the giant creatures extinct between 20,000 and 25,000 years ago.

Other researchers argue that an impact of extraterritorial objects in North America 13,000 years ago, led to rapid climate change, eventually wiping out the mammoths.

Today, it's thought that a combination of factors led to extinction.

The study, led by Biogeologist Dr Dorothée Drucker, which was published in Quaternary International explains that finds of mammoth bone or ivory artefacts become rarer throughout the Gravettian era.

She focused on finds from Germany’s Swabian Jura region and the Dordogne valley in south western France.

Together with experts from the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle in Paris, Dr Drucker found evidence that the slow disappearance of mammoths was linked to intense hunting by humans.

The team analysed the composition of stable isotopes in mammoth, horse and reindeer bones – a technique that is used for gathering dietary and environmental information from extinct species.

The relative amounts of carbon, sulphur and nitrogen isotopes provide indications of the stability of the animals’ environment.

All three species showed a mainly stable concentration of isotopes during the Gravettian era, meaning that their environment didn’t change much, ruling out climate change as the reason for the decline of mammoths.

In the early 20th century, 11,000-year-old cave paintings of woolly mammoths were found in France, suggesting that the creatures once lived side by side with humans. While this is now accepted, experts are still trying to solve the chilling question of whether humans are responsible for mammoths' extinction.

But the researchers found that the concentration of 15N nitrogen isotope in the remains of horses from the Swabian Jura, increased during the Gravettian.

Based on this information, they believe that horses in the region were taking over the ecological niche of receding mammoth populations.

They measured levels of the oxygen isotope 180 to investigate whether climate change may explain the movement.

But Dr Drucker said there were no signs of major climate changes in that epoch, ‘so it is highly likely that the decrease in mammoth populations in south western Germany was caused by humans.’

Scientists said last March that they have taken a step towards cloning the extinct woolly mammoth and there is a 'high chance' it will happen.

Experts expect to extract ‘high quality DNA’ from a 43,000 year old carcass found in Siberia.

Woolly mammoths finally died out in eastern Siberia around 4,000 years ago.

Radik Khayrullin, vice president of the Russian Association of Medical Anthropologists, said: ‘The data we are about to receive will give us a high chance to clone the mammoth.’

But he called for responsibility in bringing the ancient beast back to life, urging that competing teams seeking to win a race to clone the mammoth, not to play God for the sake of it.

‘We must have a reason to do this, as it is one thing to clone it for scientific purpose and another to clone for the sake of curiosity,’ he said.

A cloning attempt would involve a female elephant – the closest living relative of the mammoth - acting as a surrogate mother.
