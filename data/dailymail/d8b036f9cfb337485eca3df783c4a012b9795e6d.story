A young woman who was the victim of a cannibal attack had serious neck and facial injuries when police discovered her body, a inquest has heard.

Cerys Yemm, 22, was found dead in the Sirhowy Arms hostel in Argoed, south Wales earlier this month.

Her suspected attacker, recently-released prisoner Matthew Williams, died after being Tasered by police.

Williams is said to have taken a cocktail of mind-bending drugs and told friends he was hearing voices and hallucinating before attacking Miss Yemm and reportedly biting off parts of her face. 

Officers say they are treating Ms Yemm's death as murder, although they have refused to comment on exactly how she died. 

Detective Superintendent William Davies of Gwent Police told the hearing in Newport that officers found Miss Yemm dead inside the Sirhowy Arms.

He explained: 'Upon arrival, officers found the body of a female on the floor of the hotel.

An inquest heard today that Miss Yemm, pictured, was found dead by officers with serious neck and facial injuries. Her provisional cause of death has been recorded as sharp force trauma to the face and neck 

'She was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics.

'In the room with Cerys Yemm was a male identified as Matthew Williams - he was arrested and detained but died a short time later.

'His death will be the subject of a separate report.'

The inquest, which was opened and adjourned, heard a post mortem examination carried out by Home Office pathologist Dr Richard Jones recorded Miss Yemm's provisional cause of death as sharp force trauma to the face and neck.

Sharp force trauma injuries are usually wounds caused by an implement having a sharp edge - which can include knives and broken glass.

Witnesses who were in the hotel on the night have described how there was smashed china on the floor in the hotel room.  

Detective Superintendent Davies added: 'The investigation into both deaths are currently ongoing.'

Gwent Coroner David Bowen released Miss Yemm's for her funeral.

None of her family attended the five-minute hearing at Newport Coroners Court.

Mr Bowen adjourned the inquest until April next year while the police investigation continues.

Williams was staying at the hotel which operated a bail hostel for prisoners just released from jail.

The hotel owners say they will continue to operate but will never use the room where Miss Yemm died.

Williams’ mother Sally Ann Williams has said he was a paranoid schizophrenic who failed to get medical help after leaving prison.
