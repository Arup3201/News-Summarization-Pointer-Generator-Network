Met Police officers from the unit investigating Jimmy Savile are to meet with the Labour MP who revealed claims of an historic link between a paedophile network and Downing Street.

The Scotland Yard team leading the Operation Yewtree investigation into the disgraced TV presenter is to speak to Tom Watson who last week stunned the House of Commons with claims child sex abuse was linked to a former Prime Minister’s inner circle.

Mr Watson told MPs there was ‘clear intelligence’ linking a former Number 10 aide with a notorious group of sex offenders.

Met Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan Howe today announced officers investigating sex abuse claims against Jimmy Savile would speak to Labour MP Tom Watson after he told the Commons that evidence could exist linking a former Downing Street aide to a paedophile ring

He then wrote to Met Commisioner Bernard Hogan Howe giving more details which he had not made public.

Mr Watson claimed that the police file used to convict Peter Righton in 1992 of importing child pornography from Holland needed to be looked at again.

He claimed to have been contacted by a former child protection specialist who had been concerned for years that Righton’s activities and connections had not been properly investigated.

In particular, files seized from Righton’s home which included letters from known paedophiles, Mr Watson claimed.

Today Mr Hogan Howe told a media briefing in London on the progress of Operation Yewtree that officers were preparing to discuss the details of the Righton case with the West Bromwich East MP.

During Prime Minister's Questions last week, Mr Watson said there was a trail between the evidence used to convictRighton and No 10.

He
told the Commons: ‘The evidence used to convict paedophile Peter 
Righton, if it still exists, contains clear intelligence of a widespread
paedophile ring.

‘One of 
its members boasts of his links to a senior aide of a former prime 
minister who says he could smuggle indecent images of children from 
abroad.

‘The leads were
not followed up, but if the file still exists I want to ensure that the
Metropolitan Police secure the evidence, re-examine it and investigate 
clear intelligence suggesting a powerful paedophile network linked to 
Parliament and No 10.’

Mr 
Cameron said Mr Watson ‘raises a very difficult and complex case’ and he
was ‘not entirely sure which former prime minister he is referring to’.

But he agreed to look 
at the case ‘very carefully and see what the Government can do’ to give 
Mr Watson the assurances he wanted.

Prime Minister: David Cameron said Mr Watson 'raises a very difficult and complex case' and he was 'not entirely sure which former prime minister he is referring to'

Today Mr Watson welcomed the news that officers from Operation Yewtree would now investigate.

He told MailOnline: ‘I appreciate the Met Police taking an interest in what I think is a very important issue.

'The most important thing is that they secure the evidence seized from the home of Peter Righton.

‘If this still exists, there is intelligence that they could go on.’

Righton was 66 when convicted by magistrates in Evesham in Worcestershire in 1992 of importing and possessing pornographic material involving boys under the age of 16.

He had been academic expert in child care, delivering lectures on the issue across the country.

Mr Watson says he was contacted by ‘a former child protection specialist’ who 
had harboured concerns for years that the Righton case was never 
properly explored.

Writing on his blog he added: ‘The central allegation was that a large body of material had not been fully investigated.

‘Within the material...were letters from known and convicted paedophiles. The contact, who has seen the letters, claimed one paedophile in particular was of great concern.

‘He said the paedophile, who worked with children, boasted of a key aide to a former PM who could help get hold of indecent images of children.’
