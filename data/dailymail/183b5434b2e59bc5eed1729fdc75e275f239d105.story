His demise has variously been blamed on murder, leprosy, a snake bite or a fall from a chariot.

Now a new theory about the death of Tutankhamun has been put forward by a British scientist who  believes the young pharaoh’s ‘man boobs’ may hold the key.

Hutan Ashrafian, lecturer in general surgery at Imperial College London, said historians have missed evidence that the boy king of Egypt, who died mysteriously 3,000 years ago, may have had a type of epilepsy that lay behind his ‘feminised physique’ and could have caused him to die in a fall.

Riddle: Tutankhamen may have died from a genetic disorder which caused him to have a feminine physique

He says sculptures and paintings of 
the pharaoh, and four of his close male relatives, show they had 
unusually large breasts and wide hips. Not only that, but all of these 
kings died relatively young suggesting they may have shared an inherited
 condition, Mr Ashrafian says.

In a fresh review of evidence, he 
found historical accounts hint at what this was, as two of the five 
pharaohs are associated with stories of religious visions.

He believes 
they had a form of epilepsy in the brain’s temporal lobe in which 
seizures can cause vivid hallucinations.

This would also explain their 
feminine features, as the temporal lobe is connected to parts of the 
brain involved in the release of sex hormones.

Since Tutankhamun’s tomb was 
discovered in 1922, the cause of his death has been the subject of 
intense debate.

Clue: Statue depicts the Pharoah's large breasts

Mr Ashrafian says several statues of Tutankhamun  who 
died aged 18 or 19, reveal ‘prominent’ gynecomastia, the medical term 
for man boobs which is rare in depictions from the period.

His mummified body was too damaged by
 those who found it to know, but recent X-rays showing broken bones 
suggest he died in a fall, which could have been brought on by a 
seizure, he said in the journal Epilepsy and Behaviour.

His theory is backed up by the fact 
that the two pharaohs who came before Akhenaten - Amenhotep III and 
Tuthmosis IV - also appear to have had similar physiques.

King Tut's stunning tomb was discovered in 1922, sparking considerable debate over the cause of his young death.

Examination of Tutankhamun's mummified body revealed he had a fractured leg which Dr Ashrafian believes could have been the result of an epileptic seizure.

Akhenaten experienced powerful visions following which he raised the status of a minor deity called the 'sun-disk,' or Aten, into a supreme god.

This was a major departure from ancient Egyptian beliefs that there were many gods and is thought to have resulted in the earliest recorded monotheistic religion - the idea that there is only one god.

Tuthmosis IV also experienced a religious vision in the middle of a sunny day which was recorded in the Dream Stele, an inscription discovered near the Sphinx.

Dr Ashrafian added: 'People with temporal lobe epilepsy who are exposed to sunlight get the same sort of stimulation to the mind and religious zeal.'

Howard Markel, a medical historian at the University of Michigan, points out that the theory is impossible to prove as there is no definitive genetic test for epilepsy.

He said: 'It’s a very interesting hypothesis, but it’s just that — there’s no definite proof.'

The condition also causes hallucinations in sunlight, which may explain why the pharaohs believed they had religious visions
