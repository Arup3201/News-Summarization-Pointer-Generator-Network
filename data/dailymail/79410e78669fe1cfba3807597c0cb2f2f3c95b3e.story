Twelve people have been arrested in connection with terrorism around Paris today following a night of violence in nearby Belgium which saw two suspected Jihadis killed.

Meanwhile, German police also carried out raids on 11 properties, arresting two people suspected of having links to radical Islamists. 

Operations by police commandos across northern Europe saw the forces of law and order raid cells allegedly linked to Al Qaeda and IS.

It was in the town of Verviers, near Belgium's border with Germany, that the two suspects died in a fire fight on Thursday evening.

They were suspected of planning a 'Belgium Charlie Hebdo' – a reference to the attack on the satirical magazine in the French capital last week in which 12 died.

As police investigated links between the armed Islamist fanatics in both countries, twelve were placed in custody in the Paris area.

'Coordinated raids took place across the area, with suspects arrested at a number of addresses, and potential evidence seized,' said a police source.

Six of those in custody are linked to the Amedy Coulibaly, the 32-year-old IS-linked terrorist who killed four Jewish people at a Kosher deli in the city a week ago today, before being gunned down himself.

'All those arrested have links with arms and drug trafficking,' said a judicial source close to the enquiry.

He added: 'In this case they are linked with the supply of weapons and vehicles to the killers, as well as to other logistical support.'

The arrests carried out overnight were 'mainly in the Paris suburbs', and especially in Chatenay-Malabry, Epinay and Montrouge.

It was in the latter southern suburb that Coulibaly shot an unarmed policewoman dead last Thursday.

DNA tests and telephone interceptions have all been used to try and find those who were connected to the original Paris attacks, which saw 17 victims killed in total.

Automatic weapons and a rocket launcher used in the Charlie Hebdo and Kosher supermarket were purchased from Belgian gangs, police believe.

The Scorpion machine gun and the Tokarev handgun used by Coulibaly during his attack on the Jewish deli came from Brussels and Charleroi.

Fritz-Joly Joachin - who is said to have been in contact with Cherif Kouachi - arriving in court in Bulgaria, where a final decision on whether he will be deported back to France will be made

A Bulgarian court is set to make a final decision on whether to extradite a French citizen who had allegedly been in contact several times with one of the Charlie Hebdo massacre brothers. 

Fritz-Joly Joachin appeared in court in the southern city of Haskovo this morning.

He had been detained by Bulgarian police at a border checkpoint as he tried to cross into Turkey in the early hours of January 1 under a European arrest warrant which alleged he had abducted his three-year-old son - an accusation he denies.

Joachin had been travelling by bus from France to Turkey with his son, but was arrested after his wife told French authorities he planned to take their child to Syria to be raised under radical Islam.

He denies this, claiming he was just going on holiday with his son and girlfriend in Turkey.  

A second European arrest warrant alleges the 29-year-old had participated in a criminal group which plotted acts of terrorism, said Darina Slavova, a prosecutor in the town of Haskovo.

The warrant also alleges Joachin, who is of Haitian origin, had 'several contacts' with Cherif Kouachi, who slaughtered 12 people in the Charlie Hebdo offices last week with his brother Said.

It was not clear how the alleged contact took place, but it is understood to have happened last year.

Joachin's Bulgarian lawyer Radi Radev said his client denied any links to terrorism and had told a judge on Tuesday: 'I have friends but if they have committed crimes I cannot be held responsible for that.'

Speaking to a judge in a Haskovo court on Monday, Joachin agreed to be sent back to France, and the court will make a ruling on the extradition on Friday. 

And the Kalashnikovs and rocket launchers used by brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi, 34 and 32, to attack Charlie Hebdo were purchased near the Midi station, in Brussels for less than £4000.

Those killed during the 10-minute gun battle in Belgium had recently returned from Syria, and were preparing 'terrorist attacks on a grand scale', said federal prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt.

John Kerry, the US Secretary of State, arrived in Paris today, following fierce criticism at the absence of an American representative at last Sunday's mass march in support of Charlie Hebdo.

It came as some 200 friends and family prepared to attend the funeral of Stephane Charbonnier, the 47-year-old editor of Charlie Hebdo, who was better known as the cartoonist 'Charb', in the Paris suburb of Pontoise.
