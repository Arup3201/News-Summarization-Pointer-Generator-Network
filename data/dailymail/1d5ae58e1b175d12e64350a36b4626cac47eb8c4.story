London Collections: Men came and went in a blur of outlandish style but just as we were getting over the chunky heels, mesh vest tops and sci-fi fashion, Milan Fashion Week has pulled some more outrageous fashion out of the bag.

On the prestigious event's penultimate day in the Italian capital, male models looked ready for the winter weather in bomber jackets, boots and...knitted tights.

Giorgio Armani may be better known for his sharp suits and tailoring but he took a new approach for AW14 and, if his catwalk is anything to go by, our male partners will be donning fluffy thermals next season.

Is this what YOUR man will be wearing next season? Models wear wooly creations for Emporio Armani men's Fall-Winter 2014 collection, part of the Milan Fashion Week today

Does that coat double as a sleeping bag? At least the Armani models - who donned giant ponchos, helmets and fur gilets - are prepared for the winter weather

Ready for the slopes: Fashion went apres ski at Armani today. The models donned salopettes, jumpers emblazoned with the fashion house's logo, helmets and goggles

Giving Cara a run for her money: One of Armani's male model had eyebrows that put Miss Delevingne's famous brows to shame

That's better! Armani sent out dapper models clad in his signature sharp tailored suits; a welcome relief from the knitted tights that also graced the catwalk

Other heavy hitters to showcase their collections were Dolce & Gabbana, who continued their obsession with religious iconography and love of their native Sicily.

For AW14, the Norman invasion of the region is what Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana were inspired by the Norman invasion of the region, which they translated onto oversized sweatshirts emblazoned with portraits of crusaders.

Models wore snoods, which were created to resemble the chain mail of the medieval warriors. As for accessories, they were opulent and came embellished with gold beading, covered in threads and jewel-toned buttons.

In other news, Gene Simmons and the rest of Kiss made a surprise appearance at Milan Menswear Fashion Week on Saturday.

The musicians walked at the end of the John Varvatos show, pulling their signature tongues-out faces and delighting the audience with a rendition of 'Rock and Roll All Nite.'

Tomorrow is the final day of Milan Fashion Week, after which the designers of Paris - such as Valentino and Raf Simons - will showcase their finest fashion for the world to see.

Surprise! American fashion designer John Varvatos, right, is accompanied by Rock Band Kiss as he acknowledges the applause of the audience, at the end of his men's Autumn-Winter 2014 collection

Rock on! The musicians walked at the end of the John Varvatos show, pulling their signature tongues-out faces and delighting the audience with a rendition of 'Rock and Roll All Nite'

Can you see where you're going? Models walk the runway during the Andrea Pompilio show wearing bearskin hats resembling the Queen's Guards

All things bright and beautiful: Etro got things
 right at men's fashion week with their tailored jackets in bright hues 
and tweed shoes. Although, one of their jackets (R) resembled an old 
curtain

Check it out: Etro, know for their sharp menswear, sent models down the catwalk in matchy matchy fashion (including briefcases)Â 

Two by two: Models took to the catwalk in pairs at Etro and one appeared to be carrying a wooden ruler to accompany his tape measure-inspired design
