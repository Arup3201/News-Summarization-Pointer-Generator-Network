Despite claims young people are leaving the site in droves, Facebook is still the network of choice among 12- to 15-year-olds.

Almost three times as many children use Facebook than any other site, and the Californian firm’s Instagram is in second place.

But social network use across the web has declined in the past year, with figures showing only 56 per cent of us check the sites on a weekly basis.

Almost three times as many children use Facebook than any other social site or app, and the Californian firm’s Instagram is in second place. But social network use across the board has declined in the past year, with figures showing only 56 per cent of us check the sites on a weekly basis

The numbers come from Ofcom’s International Communications Market Report 2014, and its Children and Parents: Media Use and Attitudes Report.

In the UK, the number of weekly visitors to social networks has dropped from 65 per cent over the period between September 2013 to October 2014 down to 56 per cent.

Facebook is still the network of choice among 12- to 15-year-olds.

Almost three times as many children use Facebook than any other site.

Last year, 97 per cent of 12- to 15-year-olds used Facebook, compared to 96 per cent this year.

Instagram use has doubled in a year, up to 36 per cent.

This was followed by Twitter, down from 37 per cent to 28 per cent.

Snapchat and Whatsapp were included for the first time this year, and use was just below Twitter on 26 per cent and 20 per cent respectively.

The US, China and Japan saw similar decreases, but at an average of two per cent overall.

While Italian social network users rose from 60 per cent up to 75 per cent.

Ofcom blamed the general decline on the popularity of social media apps, such as Snapchat, Whatsapp and WeChat.

There has also been a drop in social network use among young children. 

But despite this drop, the Ofcom report revealed social networks are still the most popular activity on smartphones and tablets, ahead of watching videos. 

Last year, 97 per cent of 12- to 15-year-olds used Facebook, compared to 96 per cent this year.

But, Instagram use has doubled in a year, up to 36 per cent.

This was followed by Twitter, down from 37 per cent to 28 per cent.

Last year, 97% of 12- to 15-year-olds used Facebook, compared to 96% this year. Instagram use doubled in a year, up to 36%. This was followed by Twitter, down from 37% to 28%. Snapchat and Whatsapp were included for the first time, and use was 26% and 20% respectively

Snapchat and Whatsapp were included for the first time this year, and use for these apps was just below Twitter on 26 per cent and 20 per cent respectively.

Boys are more likely than girls to have a profile on YouTube - 29 per cent versus 15 per cent - while girls are more likely than boys to have a profile on Instagram – 42 per cent versus 30 per cent.
