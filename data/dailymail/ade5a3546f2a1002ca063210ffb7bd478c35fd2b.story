Privacy campaigner: Max Mosley

Labour has turned down a £1million offer from ex-Formula 1 boss Max Mosley to fund a campaign linking David Cameron to the phone hacking scandal.

The multi-millionaire, who won damages from the now-defunct News of the World over claims he organised a Nazi-themed orgy, is now a privacy campaigner.

He hoped to bankroll an attack on the Prime Minister by highlighting his ties with Andy Coulson – who was editor of the Sunday tabloid and later hired as the Conservative leader’s spin doctor.

His ‘anti-Cameron’ election drive was to focus on marginal constituencies with the aim of swinging winnable seats to Labour.

Using formal donation channels, it is claimed the ‘substantial’ offer to Labour was made a year ago. 

But Mr Mosley, 74, told a newspaper yesterday: ‘I have not heard back from them.’

It is not clear if there were any serious discussions by Labour over whether to take the sum, which would have given a huge boost to its coffers during a general election campaign.

Yesterday a party source confirmed it had been rejected, saying: ‘We don’t take money with strings attached’.

Coulson, who became Mr Cameron’s PR chief in 2007 and was brought into No 10 as director of communications in 2010, has just been released from prison after serving five months for conspiring to hack phone messages.

Although Mr Cameron insists he took ‘full responsibility’ for hiring Coulson, Labour leader Ed Miliband has accused the Prime Minister of bringing a criminal ‘into the heart of Downing Street’.

Echoing the comments yesterday, Mr Mosley told The Independent: ‘I feel strongly that David Cameron should no longer remain in office as Prime Minister. He took a criminal into Downing Street.’

Mr Mosley was president of the FIA – the international governing body for Formula 1 and other motor sports – when the News of the World published videos and photos of him taking part in a sado-masochistic orgy in 2008 in which German was spoken and uniforms were worn.

He successfully sued for breach of privacy and won £60,000 in damages after the judge ruled there was no evidence to justify calling it a Nazi orgy.

Mr Mosley has since campaigned to change European and UK privacy laws and privately underwrote some of the legal cases brought by victims of phone hacking.

He has argued in the European Court of Human Rights that ‘prior notification’ should be given to the subjects of newspaper reports to allow them to organise injunctions.

Some of the Sunday tabloid’s photographs are still online, and last year Mr Mosley won a case in France to stop Google providing links to stories about his sexual past.

Labour last night said it does not comment on individual donations.However, the offer comes at a time when Labour is struggling to match Tory election funding, with insiders estimating the party has raised less than half of what may be needed to fund a strong campaign.

Mr Mosley said he understood his offer might be viewed with some concern following the row over a £1million donation by F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone to Labour in 2007. It was later linked to the Blair government’s announcement that grand prix races would be exempt from a tobacco advertising ban.

Coulson faces a further trial in Scotland next year on perjury charges related to his 2010 account of phone hacking during the trial of former MSP Tommy Sheridan.
