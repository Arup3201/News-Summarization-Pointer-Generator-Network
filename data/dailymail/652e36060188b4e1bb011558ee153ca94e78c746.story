Hull City rounded off their preparations for a first European campaign with a 1-1 draw against Barnsley at Oakwell in a game where goalkeeping errors led to both goals.

Shane Long put the Premier League side in front three minutes into the second half, charging down Adam Davies' clearance however the hosts equalised on the hour.

Goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic rushed out to 
try to head clear a long ball from Dale Jennings only for the ball to 
bounce over his head for Barnsley's new signing Connor Hourihane to slot
 into an empty net.
