Real Madrid want to sign Manchester City striker Alvaro Negredo if they fail to land Radamel Falcao or James Rodriguez from Monaco.

Carlo Ancelotti is keen to add a forward after Alvaro Morata left for Juventus on Saturday, but the Real manager doesn't agree with City's asking price of £24million.

Negredo insisted he was 'happy and very settled' at City on Wednesday, but a difficult end to last season made the 28-year-old keen to leave the Etihad.

Atletico Madrid, having sold striker Diego Costa to Chelsea for £32m, are also interested in Negredo.

Rodriguez,
 valued at £63m, and Falcao, at £50m, means Negredo may be a fairer 
proposition for Real.

Negredo,
 a home-grown La Liga player born in Madrid, lost his place towards the 
end of last season after picking up a 
muscle injury, allowing fellow striker Edin Dzeko to take full advantage.

City, however, refuse to sell cheap as manager Manuel Pellegrini says Negredo, who failed to make Spain's World Cup squad, remains part of his plans at the Etihad.

The
 link to Real comes after the striker, nicknamed 'The Beast', seemingly put to bed 
rumours that he was unhappy with life in the north of England.

'I don’t want to leave City,' he told CityTV. 'I’m very happy and very settled here.

'I had a 
difficult end to the season and that’s why there has been a lot of 
talking but I’ve been very happy here from the first day I arrived.'

When
 asked whether he was missing life in Spain, Negredo replied: 'No. Maybe
 a bit more on the personal side than when we talk about football but I 
don’t cry easily.

'I am sensible but I have to love that person a lot to feel homesick.'

Real signed Toni Kroos from Bayern Munich for £24m 
on Thursday in a 'dream' move for the 24-year-old, fresh from winning the World Cup with Germany.
