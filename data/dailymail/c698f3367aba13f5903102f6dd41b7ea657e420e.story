The Duke of Edinburgh might not normally be thought of as the sort of chap who would take a close interest in his wife’s jewellery.

But he seemed particularly taken with the six-petal diamond flower brooch that the Queen wore to the Derby yesterday – and with very good reason.

For it was the very same item she wore when she announced her engagement to Prince Philip in 1947. It was her way of paying a highly personal tribute to her consort in the 60th anniversary year of her Coronation – and the gesture did not go unnoticed.

Nostalgic: The Duke of Edinburgh spots the Queen's significant brooch, which jogged his memory. It is believed that the Queen has not worn the brooch since her engagement

Sentimental statement: The Queen wore the brooch on the left hand side as she did in 1947. The young couple were married at Westminster Abbey in the same year

The Queen looked happy and relaxed as 
she arrived at Epsom wearing a Wedgwood blue hat and matching coat, with
 collar and cuffs that had the same design as her dress. The outfit was 
topped off with black gloves and a black handbag.

Her granddaughters Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice also watched the racing. Beatrice, who famously wore an avant garde head piece nicknamed ‘The Pretzel’ at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011, this time played safer, with a burgundy cloche hat.

Favoured pastime: The Queen, a familiar face at all the major dates in the horse-racing calendar, visited Epsom Racecourse in Surrey ahead of the Derby today with her husband the Duke of Edinburgh

Bird's eye view: The Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie observed all the action from their vantage point on the Queen's Stand at Epsom

Studying the form: The Queen was deep in conversation on the stand while the Duke of Edinburgh used his binoculars to get a better view

Meanwhile, Westminster Abbey is being
 prepared for Tuesday’s service to mark the anniversary of the Queen’s 
Coronation in 1953, 16 months after she acceded to the Throne.

More
 than 2,000 guests including High Commissioners from the Commonwealth, 
ambassadors, faith representatives and Armed Forces personnel from every
 UK county will attend the service.

Sporting event: Princess Beatrice wore a cloche-style hat by milliner Karen Henriksen, and a monochrome dress with a circle print

Blue skies: The Queen, an avid horse-racing fan, chose a mint green dress coat and a co-ordinating hat to attend the Investec Derby at Epsom Downs Racecourse today

Derby day: Princesses Eugenie, left, and Beatrice, right, joined their grandmother the Queen at the Surrey racecourse for the Investec Derby today

The
 congregation will also include John Nicholson, who, as a 12-year-old, 
sang at the Coronation alongside the Westminster scholars. Their role 
was to be the first to acclaim the new Sovereign with ‘Vivat Regina’.

The
 roses in the posy that the Queen will carry at the service are being 
flown 5,500 miles from Colombia – because home-grown buds have been held
 back because of the coldest spring in Britain for 50 years.

Creamy,
 buttermilk-coloured roses, known as Patience, and blushing pink Keira 
roses  will feature prominently in the bouquet, which will be presented 
to the Queen at the Abbey.

Finery: Princess Eugenie chose a patterned dress in summery shades of blue, white and taupe, teamed with a taupe hat and nude heels, while her sister Princess Beatrice wore an unusual black and white dress with black heels and maroon accessories

Bold: Princess Beatrice, 24, accessorised her black and white dress with a maroon cloche hat, a black and gold studded belt and gold jewellery

Quality time: Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie appeared deep in conversation at Epsom today (left), while Prince Philip kept his wife the Queen entertained (right)

Good spirits: The Duke of Edinburgh kept these racegoers entertained on the Queen's Stand overlooking the Surrey racecourse today

Ruler of the racecourse: Ruler of the World, ridden by jockey Ryan Moore, thundered to victory watched by thousands of racegoers including members of the royal family at Epsom

All smiles: Surrounded by members of her family, the Queen was captured beaming in the sunshine as she arrived at the racecourse in Surrey ahead of today's Derby

Family affair: The Queen, a regular race-goer, was accompanied today by her husband Prince Philip (right behind the Queen), their son Prince Andrew (left behind the Queen), and his daughters Beatrice and Eugenie (seen right in the background)

Formal: Prince Andrew, dapper in top hat and tails, joined his daughters Princess Eugenie (left with her father) and Princess Beatrice (right) at Epsom Racecourse today

Sisters: Princess Eugenie, left, chose nude patent heels similar to those favoured by the Duchess of Cambridge, while Beatrice, right, wore black to match her dress

Crowds: Thousands of racegoers enjoyed bright sunshine and pleasant temperatures at the racecourse in Surrey on Epsom Derby day today

Radiant: Les Miserables star Samantha Barks, 22, looked stunning in a blue, white and black body con dress with a co-ordinating hat and white clutch bag

International visitors: Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, the Prime Minister and Vice President of the United Arab Emirates, and his wife Princess Haya of Jordan were also in attendance

Best-dressed: Actress Gemma Chan, left, chose a simple yet striking monochrome dress, left, while her boyfriend Jack Whitehall was smart in a grey three-piece suit

Signs of summer: Racegoers decked out in their finery - including the obligatory colourful hats - enjoyed glasses of Pimms as they cheered on the horses today

Glamour: Ladies' Day was yesterday but that didn't stop the girls pulling out all the stops for the Epsom Derby today
