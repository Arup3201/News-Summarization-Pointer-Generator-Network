The head of the NHS is to retire early on a £110,000-a-year pension, following months of mounting pressure over his role in one of the worst-ever hospital scandals.

Sir David Nicholson will quit next March with a taxpayer-funded pension pot worth nearly £2million.

His position has been under intense  scrutiny after a major report implicated him in the Mid Staffordshire hospital  disaster, where up to 1,200 patients are thought to have died needlessly.

Sir David Nicholson was grilled by MPs over the official report into serious failings at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust

Campaigners had repeatedly called for Sir David Nicholson to resign over the Mid Staffordshire NHS scandal

He has also been accused of presiding
over a Stalinist culture across the health service, in which doctors, 
nurses and managers are afraid to speak out about poor care.

Julie Bailey, of Cure the NHS, said it was 'fantastic news' that Sir David was to leave the health service

Last night bereaved families and MPs questioned the size of his pension and demanded to know why he wasn’t leaving immediately.

Although he is due to stay on for 
another ten months, he told Health Service Journal he may leave earlier 
if a suitable replacement is found.

Sir David, who is 57, would normally
be expected to retire when he reached the age of 60.

Even in his resignation letter to 
Malcolm Grant, chairman of NHS England, he refused to apologise for the 
Mid Staffordshire fiasco.

He merely said: ‘Whilst I believe we have made
significant progress together under my leadership, recent events 
continue to show that on occasion the NHS can still sometimes fail 
patients, their families and carers.

‘This continues to be a matter of 
profound regret to me but please note that on a daily basis I continue, 
and will always continue, to be inspired and moved by the passion that 
those who work in the NHS continue to show.’

That did little to appease Julie 
Bailey, who set up campaign group Cure the NHS after her mother Bella 
died at the trust. Describing his pension as ‘an obscene amount of money
for failure’, she said: ‘He’s going with his knighthood and pension 
still intact.

'He’ll have a happy retirement, unlike us who have been 
left with awful memories of watching our loved ones suffer.

‘We are disappointed he is not going 
immediately but hopefully this is a chance to finally change the NHS. We
can start to look to the future now.  He was part of the problem – not 
part of the solution.

'We now need a leader who will galvanise and 
inspire the front line, not bully them.’

'Cure the NHS' campaigners demanded Sir David resign but he insisted he would stay on in his £200,000 job

Sir David Nicholson has worked in the NHS since 1977, the same year he joined the Communist party.

After working in mental health for a decade, he rose through the ranks to become chief executive of several bodies including the Shropshire and Staffordshire Strategic Health Authority at the time of the care scandal in which up to 1,200 people died.

In 2006 he became chief executive of the whole of the National Health Service, in charge of a £90billion budget and 1.3million staff.

He claimed £50,000-a-year in expenses on top of a salary of his £211,000 salary, £20,000 bonus and around £47,000 of ‘benefits in kind'.

The package was criticised at a time when his 'Nicholson Challenge' was imposing £20billion in efficiency savings on the NHS.

He insisted he had to travel by first-class to do his job, but refused to explain to MPs why his expense claims included 41 first-class trips to Birmingham, where his 35-year-old wife lives with their baby daughter.

He was also accused of overseeing a culture of fear within the NHS where hospitals fiddle their figures and whistleblowers are prevented from speaking out.

In a three-year period under his rule a total of £14.7 million was spent on almost 600 ‘compromise agreements' preventing ex-employees from speaking out.

Tory MP Charlotte Leslie, who put 
down a Commons motion calling for Sir David to resign, said: ‘It is a 
terrible indictment of our political system that he has not already been
fired.

‘It is an even worse indictment that 
in an era where we talk about accountability, he should walk away to an 
enormous pension, funded by the public.’

Andrew Bridgen is Tory MP for 
Leicestershire North West, and some of his constituents died at 
Stafford. He said: ‘His position was untenable, he had lost confidence 
of 90 per cent of NHS staff and more importantly of the patients.

‘He should go sooner – as soon as a 
suitable replacement is found. I believe we need a new era of honesty 
and candour within the NHS and that has to start from the top.

‘The fact he hasn’t apologised for 
the awful events of Mid Staffordshire and elsewhere and his huge pension
will undoubtedly rankle with many.’

Sir David has faced calls to quit 
since February, when a high profile report linked him to the appalling 
neglect of patients at Mid Staffordshire NHS trust between 2005 and 
2009. Relatives described how elderly patients became so thirsty they 
resorted to drinking dirty water from vases, while nurses said they left
wards in tears because care was so poor.

Sir David was accused of not taking 
action while in charge of the regional health body overseeing the 
trust,  and later when appointed NHS chief executive in 2006.

In fact at the height of the scandal,
in October 2005, he toured the hospital wards and wrote a glowing 
letter to managers praising them for hitting targets. But he has 
repeatedly insisted that at the time he had ‘no idea’ of the unfolding 
scandal and maintained that the failings were ‘system wide’.

He came under further pressure when 
it emerged he had ignored the concerns of two whistleblowers about 
another trust, University Hospitals Lincoln, where 670 patients may have
died needlessly.

Sir David, who earns £211,000 a year,
became known as the ‘man with no shame’ because of his stance over the 
scandals. Sir David’s pension pot is currently worth just under 
£1.9million, although this will almost certainly increase with inflation
by the time he is due to leave, when it is likely to be more than 
£2million.

Although his retirement was announced
only yesterday, Government officials are believed to have been planning
it for some time, having realised his position was untenable.

And while his letter of resignation 
had yesterday’s date at the top, it includes a paragraph which refers to
preparations for reforms beginning on April 1, suggesting it was 
written in March. 

The Mail understands that bosses at 
NHS England were lining up possible successors three months ago, despite
publicly giving Sir David their full backing.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: 
‘[Sir David’s] job has often been incredibly complex and  very 
difficult, and yet he has always had a reputation for staying calm, and 
maintaining a relentless focus on what makes a difference on  the NHS 
frontline.’
