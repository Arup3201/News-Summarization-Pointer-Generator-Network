Burnley have unveiled the new home kit they hope will inspire their players next season on their return to the top flight.

It will be only Burnley’s second appearance in the Premier League for 37 years, after an ill-fated season in 2009/10 that saw them relegated straight back to the Championship.

Sean Dyche’s side finished second in the Championship behind Leicester City last season to secure one of the two automatic promotion places.

Classic design: Burnley have released images of their new home kit which goes on sale on July 1

Determined: The slogan 'Back in our town, back on our turf' can be seen behind the image of the new kit

The new claret and blue Puma shirt features a tailored collar and sweeping blue placket, with closed-hole mesh to the shoulders and side panels.

The evoPOWER kit is a modern design with a classic look that combines ‘simple designs with a subtle and clever appearance’.

Simple: The club's sponsors Puma have opted for a straightforward design for next season's socks

Blue piping complements the sleeves, along with a fine detail woven crest with satin stitch detail.

Puma Head of Marketing UKIB Ruth How said: ‘Burnley is a club with great history and tremendous support. We're delighted that they are returning to the Premier League and wanted to create a kit which is worthy of the exciting season ahead.

‘Players and fans continue to wear the claret with pride, and will do so even more this season in the top tier of English football. We believe that Burnley can enjoy a fantastic season, and we look forward to standing alongside them throughout.’

The new Burnley home kit goes on sale from Tuesday, July 1, in-store, and online.
