A KFC branch and other restaurants were forced to close at a food court in the Plaza Norte shopping centre in Lima, Peru, after a dramatic video emerged of a rat running loose.

The footage, shot late last month by one of the customers, shows the crowd screaming and running as they noticed the rodent searching for scraps under the tables. 

A man who appears to be part of the security staff tries to stamp on the rat but fails. 

The rat proved a crafty customer as it scurried around searching for chicken and chips in the KFC

The filmer, Julianna Cadillo, later wrote online that there had been two rats but she'd only captured one on video. 

According to local media Jose Miguel Garcia, Ministry of Health spokesman, said they ordered the closure of a KFC branch in the food court and other restaurants in the Plaza Norte after the incident. 

Customers in the KFC restaurant in Lima screamed and leapt on chairs and tables as the rat ran amok

Allegedly the restaurant has been fined as the rats pose 'a threat to sanitary conditions for humans.'

Thomas Casares Orozco, 24, who was at the restaurant, said: 'I was eating with my girlfriend when she screamed and jumped up pointing out the rat, then everyone started running for it scattering food everywhere.

'One rat tried to grab a chicken leg but when a security guard turned up it tried to run off.

'There was chaos as people made off or climbed onto chairs and tables. I saw one bloke stamp on a rat but it didn't seem to stop it - it ran under a flower box and I didn't see it again.'

This video footage of the rat rampage in the shopping mall, called the Plaza Norte that covers 200,000 square meters, quickly went viral. The mall is considered one of Peru's biggest with 14 movie theaters, dozens of restaurants in the restaurant area and a fun park for kids.

But the rat proved too quick for the security man's foot, and scurried off to terrorise more people

Facebook users were outraged by the appearance of the rodent but some of the netizens took it with humour and made jokes about the incident.

'They are training rats, they wanted to show us what they can do', said Anoesis Afer, one netizen.

But others were less amused: 'It is disgusting. I would not eat in that place ever', said another user, Paz Mendez.

The video was shared by netizen Julianna Cad who said: 'There were actually two rats, but I only managed to record one of them.'
