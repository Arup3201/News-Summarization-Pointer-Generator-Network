We all have tricks to help us out of a ticket, but most of us would simply bat our eyelashes or make up a far-fetched excuse. 

But one man showed that knowing how to solve a Rubik's Cube might just come in handy one day.  

Steven Brundage was pulled over by police after he was caught driving over the limit as he left a party in New York City in the early hours of Saturday morning. 

But he managed to dodge a ticket after dazzling the cops with magic.  

Magician Steven Brundage was pulled over by cops when he was caught over the speed limit in New York

He says he was doing 42 miles per hour in a 30 zone. A ticket seemed certain, but in the clip he posted on YouTube the following day, he shows how he escaped.

After the cop spotted the cards in his car, Mr Brundage revealed he was a magician.

The officer asked him to perform a trick and if he was suitably impressed, he would be free to go.

After the magician says he would complete a Rubik's Cube in a set time, the cop jokingly says: 'I can't say like one second, that's not going to happen.'

They agree he has 15 seconds to complete the cube but Mr Brundage takes an extra five seconds to complete the task as the officers count out loud.

But the magician escaped with no ticket after dazzling officers with his Rubik's Cube trick on Saturday

In his first trick, he completes the Rubik's Cube in just 20 seconds and an officer shakes his hand

The officer's are suitably impressed - but then Mr Brundage says he can complete the cube in just one second as the officer originally suggested.

Amazingly, he mixes up all the sides and throws the cube into the air, It then lands with every side complete.

After mixing the sides up again, he throws it behind his back and again, catches it with every side complete. 

Accompanying his clip, Mr Brundage, from Schenectady in New York, wrote: 'December 5th around 3am I was pulled over doing 42 in a 30 MPH. 

'I told the cop I was coming from a holiday party in NYC. 

'He asked why I had all the cards in my car and I told him I was a magician. He then asked me to show him a magic trick.

'I'm glad to say I left without a ticket.' 

But Mr Brundage then follows it up with an even more impressive feat where he throws the cube in the air and it lands in his hands a second later with every side complete
