Britain is bracing itself for a storm bringing gale force winds of up to 100mph, which could rip up trees, damage buildings and affect public transport. 

Two powerful Atlantic storms are set to batter the country, with winds as ferocious as those which caused misery last winter due to sweep in from this evening, forecasters have warned.

And after the twin storms have past, snow is expected to fall in parts of Britain bringing further transport chaos.

Britain is set to be battered by powerful gales as two storms hit the country from this evening, and forecasters warn snow could follow

A powerful jet stream moving at around 250mph across the Atlantic will bring the storms and high winds to Scotland and the north of England this evening, gathering force and pace from the recent exceptionally cold snap in America. 

The Met Office has issued an amber warning - telling people to “be prepared” in  the north of Scotland, where winds are expected to reach 100mph. 

The rest of Scotland has been issued with a yellow Met Office warning as gusts of up to 70mph are forecast.

Scotland will see the most powerful winds on Friday and Saturday, as the centres of two consecutive storms pass by the northern coast. In northern parts of England and Wales winds could reach 70mph, with gales of 50mph seen in the South.

The warnings follow huge waves seen crashing into sea defences at Blackpool in Lancashire yesterday.  

The Met Office alert said ‘The public should be aware of potential for disruption to transport and power supplies and the possibility of structural damage. Large waves may also lead to dangerous conditions along some coasts.’

But temperatures will be remarkably mild for this time of year, reaching 15C (59F) in London - compared with the average January temperature of 6.9C (44.4F).

Forecasters said the ferocious weather is being caused by an exceptionally strong jet stream triggered by cold conditions in the US.

Here they come: Two storms are set to hit the north of the UK in quick succession later this week because of a strong jet stream, currently travelling at a speed of around 250mph moving across the Atlantic Ocean. It will bring winds of up to 90mph in northern Scotland

Storms of up to 90mph are set to batter the country by the weekend, with winds as powerful as those which caused misery last winter due to sweep in tomorrow

Despite the storm warnings, many parts of the UK woke up to sub zero conditions causing chaos for commuters this morning. 

South West Trains services were suspended because of icy conditions between Haslemere and Portsmouth Harbour.

A spokesman said the ice had caused ‘poor rail conditions between St Denys and Fareham’ and services would be disrupted until at least 9am. 

The Cambridgeshire Fens were covered with a thick layer of ice and frost this morning after temperatures dipped as low as -3.5C in parts of the country.

The fields of Wicken Fen sparkled with white ice as commuters had a slippery journey to work today. Temperatures went down to -3.5C in Aberdeenshire overnight, -3.1C in Dorset and -2.3C in Kent.

Experts at the Met Office say today will be wet in Western areas, including Cumbria, Western Scotland and Wales, whilst the rest of the country should be dry, but cloudy.

There will also be strong winds on exposed coasts in the North West, with gusts of up to 60mph. Showers are expected in Scotland tonight, which could turn wintry on higher ground.

Tomorrow is set to be a dry and bright day for much of the country, with highs of 11C, but the wind will pick up in the North during the evening.

The windy weather will continue across the country on Saturday, but there will also be a big drop in temperature, with highs of just 7C.

It is set to be a dry day with bright spells, but some rain is expected in the North, which could fall as snow in Scotland, the Lake District and the Pennines.

Sunday will remain cold, but will generally be dry and bright with some strong winds in the North.

'It will feel much colder on Saturday as temperatures return to average,' said Dan Williams, of the Met Office.

'The temperatures are expected to get milder again at the start of next week.' 

Yesterday, Mark Wilson of the Met Office said wind speeds would be similar to those seen in the fierce storms towards the end of 2013, when tens of thousands of homes were left without power, trees were uprooted, trains and flights cancelled and floods crippled huge swathes of the UK.

But while the worst weather then was seen in southern England, this time rural parts of Scotland will bear the brunt, Mr Wilson added.
