This is the shocking moment a young woman is thrown into the air after being hit by a police car but then walks away almost unscathed.

Russian police are investigating after Yesenia Alexeyeva was struck by the vehicle, which was answering an emergency call in the Russian port city of Rostov-on-Don in western Russia's Rostov Oblast region.

The 20-year-old was on her way to meet friends when she was captured on the dashboard camera of fellow motorist Nail Yeveseyev.

The young woman can been seen attempting to cross the road as she goes to meet friends in the Russian port city of Rostov-on-Don

But as she crosses the street a police car, answering an emergency call appears and strikes her

She can be seen crossing the road along with an older woman when the police patrol car comes speeding down the road.

It then strikes the young woman throwing her up into the air, before she eventually seems to land on her back.

The officers and passers-by then rush to her aid but despite her ordeal, she almost manages to stand up and makes her way into the back of the police car.

She was then driven to hospital, where it was found she had only suffered bruising and she was released the same day.

Mr Yevseyev said: 'The traffic was really jammed and nose to tail, and because it was moving so slowly the young woman and an older woman walked across the two lanes in front of my car.

'When they went to cross the two lanes of oncoming traffic, both looked right to make sure nothing was coming, but neither of them realised that a police car was on its way to an emergency call was travelling against the oncoming traffic from the other side.

But despite her ordeal, she quickly managed to stand up and after being taken to hospital, was only found to be bruised

'It hit the girl and knocked her up into the air and over the roof landing on the ground on her back. She didn't seem to be able to stand up easily afterwards but she was conscious, and the police car driver helped her into his car.'

The officer driving the car is now being investigated as to whether he was driving with the necessary precautions while travelling to answer an emergency call.

If he is found to have breached the rules, police said that he would be prosecuted. He has been suspended while the investigation is carried out, they added.
