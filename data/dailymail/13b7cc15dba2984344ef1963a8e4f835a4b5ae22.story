A man who dedicated all his free time to giving back was tragically killed on Friday, the day after Thanksgiving. 

Dionel Ramirez, of North Amityville, New York, pulled up to a local 7-11 and left his car running while he ran in to get a coffee and food to bring to a local soup kitchen.

As he was inside, a man jumped in his car and began to drive away, so Ramirez ran out in front of the car.

The thief ran over Ramirez, a 69-year-old U.S. Army veteran, and kept driving.
