Jasmine Johnston doesn't consider herself to be racist.

The 33-year-old mother of four from Brisbane thinks it's unfair that her mother in law raises four children, and an Aboriginal woman who lives across the road with the same number of kids gets more in welfare payments.

'They're both in housing commissions, the only difference is my mother in law is white and they've got part Aboriginal in them,' she said.

'I feel like it's unfair, my mother in law was in the army when she had my husband and stuff, she's worked, so it's very hard it just seems like more things are given to [Aborigines].'

Jasmine is one of six Australians starring in new SBS documentary First Contact.

Similar to the acclaimed Go Back To Where You Came From, the show takes six 'ordinary' Australians and immerses them in Aboriginal communities to try to challenge their prejudices about the Indigenous population.

'Petrol sniffing', 'wasters' and 'spending their dole cheques on booze' are among the labels the six people give to Aborigines at first.

Host Ray Martin said none of the opinions he heard on the show shocked him, as he had heard them many times before.

The veteran journalist and passionate advocate for Aboriginal issues said six out of 10 Australians have never met or have little to do with an Indigenous person.

'The Aboriginal problem is a festering sore of Australian society, it's one of those things we have to fix,' Mr Martin said.

Jasmine says that months after filming she feels like some of her questions went unanswered, and she still believes it is unfair Aborigines get higher welfare payments and placements in university

'So we thought we would take six people - average Aussies who weren't racists, or weirdos or nutters – and have people willing to ask questions and willing to question their beliefs.

'Why do they drink so much, why don't they send their kids to school, why don't they leave townships and get a job? They are all valid questions and not racist questions.'

But while most participants have their strong opinions about Indigenous Australians changed over the course of the program, Jasmine says she is still 'up in the air'.

She told Daily Mail Australia that months after filming, and before the first of three episodes begins airing on Tuesday night, she feels like some of her questions went unanswered.

'Definitely the whole welfare thing, you know the money, I feel like that wasn't properly answered,' she said.

Over 28 days, the participants stayed with Aboriginal people all over the country

'And how they can automatically get a place in uni degrees.

'Obviously because I've got children too I feel like it affects me, they might be taking my children's place in uni.'

Over 28 days, the participants stayed with Aboriginal people all over the country and were immersed in their way of life, from people living in Redfern in inner-city Sydney to remote communities only accessible by plane.

Jasmine said this helped her reconsider some things - but not everything.

'I still don't fully understand the stolen generation, but I understand that Australia needed to say sorry. I was on the fence,' she said.

'I definitely believe some remote communities are disadvantaged to some degree.

Host and veteran journalist Ray Martin hopes viewers will recognise themselves in the six participants, and similarly will question the way they think

'The Aboriginal problem is a festering sore of Australian society,' Mr Martin said

'But definitely not the Aboriginal people that live close to major cities, they're not disadvantaged in any way.'

Jasmine says she thinks she's ignorant but not racist – but she acknowledges that viewers will probably disagree.

'I'm not worried and I stand behind everything I said,' she said.

'The biggest myth is that Aboriginal people get a special deal, when comes to welfare and life.

'They do not get a special deal, we said to the guys "You've seen the truth, hands up those who’d swap places with an Aboriginal" and not one said yes.

'The special deals they get are health, education and housing that is woeful and shameful.

'The other one is that they get interest free cars and interest free housing, it's amazing how many people think that, and that's BS that just isn't true.

'I guess the other one is they're loafers and don’t want to help themselves.

'When people say why do Aboriginal kids get a special deal for education? That’s just good economics – it's dopey to keep paying this money for people who are on welfare or in jail because they don't have an education.'

'It's just because of ignorance - I didn't get taught anything about Aboriginal people at school.'

She says her husband also shares her views, even though he possibly has Aboriginal heritage.

'He's very anti because of the name they've got, you know "they're slackers they're dole bludgers", they get interest free home loans and stuff,' she said.

'Just at the fact that they get handed everything - that's why he's worked all his life since 16 and he's worked for the house we've got.'

Jasmine hopes to talk to the cast members and some of the Aboriginal people that featured on the show at a reunion party on Thursday to clear up some of her unanswered questions.

Another cast member, Bo-dene Stieler, feels like her views have been completely changed by the experience.

The 25-year-old, who works at a supermarket and lives in Coburg in Melbourne, cringes when she thinks about some of the things she said in front of the camera.

'I said Aboriginal people were wasters, I said they don't have jobs and that they get a lot of free stuff,' she said.

'Going into it I really needed to get my wisdom teeth out but I couldn't afford it, and if I was of Aboriginal descent I could have got it done.

'I guess it's hard… People wonder why there's a different way for Aboriginal people to get stuff.'

Bo-dene said her most difficult moment came in the remote community of Elcho Island off the coast of Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory.

'The conditions were very confronting, it's almost third world being part of Australia and I never thought places like that existed here.

Alice said she thought she identified with Aboriginal beliefs

The TV show airs over three night on SBS and starts on Tuesday November 18

'The first night was the most scariest night I've ever had in my life.'

Bo-dene said she was being rude to their hosts because she felt threatened by the rubbish and wild dogs.

'I hope when people watch it they can appreciate that the place was really different to what I'm used to,' she said.

'I said things like "Why is it so dirty, if you can afford to smoke you can afford to get cleaning products".'

The highlight was visiting Fitzroy Crossing in Western Australia, where Aboriginal leader June Oscar has successfully campaigned for laws restricting the purchase of  alcohol in the town. Among its population, one-third of children suffer from foetal alcohol syndrome.

'They started in their community a ban on alcohol, so it was really good, it was the first community that showed self-determination which was really impressive to see in my eyes,' Bo-dene said.

'A lot of places were in the mindset that they were waiting for outside help, it's a very tough cycle.'

Bo-dene knows she is opening herself up to a lot of criticism by appearing on the show, but she chose to do it because she wanted her mind to be changed.

'Growing up I didn't have a lot of interaction with Aboriginal people, and I only ever see Aboriginal people come to the service desk at work to get money,' she said.

'I don't consider myself a racist - a lot of my closest friends are from India and China and stuff – and it annoyed me I had such a negative opinion of Aboriginal people.

'I really wanted my opinion to change, which is why I asked so many questions.'

Mr Martin hopes viewers will recognise themselves in the six participants, and similarly will question the way they think.

'People who watch it hopefully will say that's what I think, that's my opinion too, which is not racist they simply don't know,' he said.

First Contact begins airing 8.30pm Tuesday 18 November followed by episode 2 at 8.30pm on Wednesday 19 November, and concluding at 8.30pm on Thursday 20 November – broadcast simultaneously each night on SBS ONE and NITV, and replayed at 9.30pm on SBS 2
