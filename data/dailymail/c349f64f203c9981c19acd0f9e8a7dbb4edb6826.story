Rebuilding an icon is no easy task, especially one so revered as Lara Croft. Rhianna Pratchett - daughter of Discworld author Terry - talks us through the process and why organisations such as Little Miss Geek are vital in getting more women involved in gaming.1. What made you want to work on the Tomb Raider game?

Rhianna: It's Lara! How could I not? After working on a couple of female protagonists in the past (Faith in Mirror's Edge and Nariko/Kai in Heavenly Sword) it seemed like the perfect next step.

The fact that the game was a reboot, and I would get to stamp a little bit of myself onto the new Lara was also very enticing. Reimagining a 16 year-old gaming icon like Lara Croft really is a once in a lifetime challenge.

2. With the industry evolving, how have demands on writers changed over the years?

Rhianna: When I first got into the industry 15 years ago as a games journalist, no one was really talking about games writing. It was still being done behind the scenes, but it wasn't getting much focus or attention, either from the press or developers/publishers themselves.

Call for action: Pratchett wants to see more female faces in games and the industry as a whole

Nor was the industry really embracing professional writers as standard. In the years that followed the industry did start to remedy this and get more experienced writers onboard. Unfortunately, it was often very late in the development process, when all they could be was something akin to a narrative paramedic.

These days it's got better, but the industry is still trying to work out how to incorporate writers and narrative designers into the development process and establish the best working practices.

However, this is a two-way street and therefore more writers need to learn about the unique challenges and limitations that exist in writing for games. They also need to really understand the benefits of utilising the entirety of a game to express the narrative, not just traditional cinematic methods.

3. What is your favourite thing about Lara Croft? Does the industry need more female stars?

Rhianna: I like the fact that alongside the bad-a**ery, she's an intelligent, archaeology nerd with a real understanding how our history shapes us.

Yes, the industry does need more female protagonists, but it is also in dire need of more protagonists who fall outside the whitey-mcstubbly format.

The industry has become far too reliant on male, white, straight, mid-20s, gravelly voiced, short hair and stubble covered heroes. We need to develop much greater diversity across the board when it comes to gender, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation and ability.

4. What inspired you when writing Tomb Raider?

Rhianna: Researching the period and the mythology we draw upon was fascinating. We also looked towards real world tales of survival (such as Aron Ralston's story and the Andes survivors) for inspiration. This really is a story about the enduring nature of the human spirit and will to survive.

 5. Any games you’ve been signed up to work on in the future?

Rhianna: Yes. But nothing I can talk about yet. Sorry!

At what time does your writing come in at the time of game development?

Rhianna: This really depends on what kind of game is being developed, how important narrative is to the experience and whether the team behind it are used to working with writers.

Writers are not normally involved at the start of the process (which is generally focused on design and gameplay mechanics) but come in later to work on story structure, character development and script.

This can be anywhere from one to two years into a three to four year production cycle. Ideally writers and narrative designers should be included much earlier in the process, where they can be of most benefit. However, although the industry is slowly getting used to fitting narrative professionals into games development, we’re still going through a bit of a ‘square-peg in a round hole’ phase.

What was the hardest aspect of re-writing a character as popular as Lara and did you consult with fans at all?

Rhianna: I didn’t come into the process until about a year into development, so I’m not sure what happened in the early stages. However, I know that Crystal did feel obligated to innovate and refresh the franchise for their fans, and not just repeat what had been done before.

Certainly depicting Lara at a time when she didn’t have the guns, gadgets and knowhow to easily get herself out of every situation, was quite risky.

Fans aren’t used to seeing Lara like that. In fact we’re not used to seeing any videogames character express sentiments like fear, uncertainty or remorse. However, when you’re dealing with a character’s origin story, you need to show where they’ve came from and not just where they finished up. We wanted players to experience that evolution for themselves.

Were you a massive fan of the early games yourself?

Rhianna: I played and enjoyed the first game and a little of the second. The launch of Tomb Raider III was actually my first experience of the games industry. But somewhere down the line I lost interest in the franchise. I felt that the sex-symbol nature of Lara became overplayed by the wider media and that had somewhat obscured the games themselves.

What influence did your Dad have on your love of gaming?

Rhianna: Dad really kick-started it. He was always into electronics, computers and robotics and introduced me to my first game - Mazogs on the Sinclair ZX81. I was hooked! We would often play games together – he would play the game and I would sit beside him, with a pencil and graph paper, drawing the maps and guiding him.

Is there a part of the game you are particularly proud of?

Rhianna: I’m glad that we got to show a different side of a character that everyone thought they knew. One of the things that I love about the game, which has absolutely nothing to do with me, is the concept art, including the box art for the game – it’s beautiful, but not sexualised, strong, but also characterful. It really typifies the direction we’re taking Lara.

6. How is Little Miss Geek helping girls be inspired to have a career in games design?

Rhianna: A lot of young girls don't realise how diverse the career opportunities are in games development. Many think that you need elite math skills and a vast knowledge of all things tech to work in games, and haven't thought about avenues like design, producing, art, writing or composing.

Initiatives such as the ones started by Little Miss Geek are essential for getting young girls engaged and excited about games design, narrative design and coding.

Giving them hands-on experiences with level editors and watching them create and build levels for themselves is very rewarding. Their faces light up. Suddenly they've discovered a whole new world that's out there for the taking. It's empowering for them.

Little Miss Geek wants to inspire the next generation of young girls to become tech pioneers and to cause nationwide change from the ground up. For more information visit: www.littlemissgeek.org.
