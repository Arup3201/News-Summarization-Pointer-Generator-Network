A fake bride who has been jailed for her part in a sham marriage ring, 
tried to prove her romance was real by taking a series of loved-up selfies at branches of McDonald's.

Hellen

 Adedjumo-Dani, 31, took photographs of herself with her Hungarian fake partner 
sharing burgers and fries inside fast food outlets to convince 
authorities of her relationship.

Investigating officers probing her case also found a selection of mobile phone snaps of the pair posing inside different McDonald’s restaurants 
across Birmingham.

The court heard of the extent pregnant Adedjumo-Dani had gone to cover her tracks, and investigators even found pictures of the pair relaxing in fluffy dressing gowns on a bed 
together- trying to look the picture of domestic bliss.

She had even changed her partner’s name to, 'Babe' in her phone to show her affection for him.

Adedjumo-Dani
 married her groom, who has not been named, at a Birmingham registry office in June 2013 and she 
had a picture of her wedding day saved on her mobile phone.

However, officers from the Home Office were not convinced by any 
of the McDonald’s selfies and Adedjumo-Dani was found guilty after a two-day trial in March this year.

She
 was jailed on Friday at Birmingham Crown Court for 22 months, along 
with three other brides and the main 'fixer' of the sham marriages, 38-year-old Azuha Izegbune, who was 
crucial in setting up fake weddings in order to grant to women visas.

Adedjumo-
 Dani, who is expecting a baby in October, has been warned that she could
 face possible deportation once she completes her prison sentence.

The court heard that ex-security guard Izegbune, from Birmingham, was paid to arrange fake weddings between Hungarian and Nigerian nationals so they could remain in the UK.

The weddings, staged at registry offices in Birmingham, Stoke and Glasgow, were arranged so both brides and grooms could secure European Area Residence Cards.

Some of the grooms were flown in to the UK just hours before the fake ceremonies took place, with the scam exposed following a Home Office probe.

Sentencing, Judge Elizabeth Stacey said Izegbune had undermined 
the UK’s border controls and described him as 'the lynch-pin, the 
organiser and the fixer' of an eight-month conspiracy between December 
2012 and September 2013.

She said: 'You met 
registrars, bought plane tickets, acted as witness and interpreter and 
recruited Ivett Szanto to help you find Hungarian grooms and brides.

'I have read the wonderful testimonies 
about you. It’s just desperately sad that you have used your 
considerable charm and skills to take part in these activities.'

Izegbune is himself married to a 
Hungarian and has lived legally in the UK since 2009 with dual Nigerian 
and Hungarian nationality.

The father-of-two was jailed for 31 months after pleading guilty to five counts of 
conspiracy to facilitate a breach of UK immigration law.

Meanwhile,
 Hungarian national Ivett Szanto, 31, admitted taking part in one fake 
marriage with a Nigerian man who was also seeking a visa.

She had conspired with Nigerian-born 
ringleader Izegbune to help set up two further marriages with men she 
knew from her native Budapest.

Szanto had her sham marriage stopped mid-ceremony on May 30, 2013, in Stoke, Staffordshire, the court heard.

Sentencing her to 20 months, Judge 
Stacey said: 'Your role in this was much more peripheral. You were a 
small cog in the wheel. It was Izegbune who was directing you.'

Ivett Szanto, left, was jailed for taking part in one marriage and conspiring with Izegbune to arrange two others. Chioma Nwangwu, right, married her groom in Birmingham in June 2013 and was jailed for 16 months

The court heard the fake brides 
handed over an unknown amount of cash in a bid to win the residence 
cards - which would have given them the legal right to remain in the UK 
and Europe.

But two of the weddings were stopped halfway through and a price list for a £7,500 ceremony was later recovered.

It showed just a £20 budget was allocated for the wedding dress, rings and shoes.

Nigerian women Nwabunwanne Eze, 35, 
and Chioma Nwangwu, 28, both from Birmingham, were all jailed for taking
 part in their own fake marriages.

Sentence: Nwanunwanne Eze, left, was jailed for 17 months for her attempted scam marriage in Glasgow - which was raided by investigators

Nwangu married her groom Birmingham registry office in June 2013.

Eze attempted to marry at Glasgow registry office in August 2013 - but the ceremony was raided by investigators.

She
 and Nwangwu pleaded guilty to one charge of breaching immigration law 
and were jailed for 16 months and 17 months respectively.

The
 court heard that four members of Eze’s close family, including her own 
mother, were murdered on their farm in Nigeria in 2009.

She had studied Health and Social Care at South Birmingham College after arriving legitimately on a student visa in 2010.

She exhausted all the appeals to stay 
in the country and took part in the sham marriage just before she would 
have been forced to leave the country. She has since lodged an 
application seeking asylum.

Nwangwu worked in a bank in Nigeria before arriving in Birmingham to study at Birmingham City University in 2011.

She
 returned home, but came back on a six-month visitor visa and wanted to 
stay in the UK after that expired to be with her genuine partner - a 
Nigerian who is legally in the country.

The Nigerian women were all warned they would face possible deportation once they complete their prison sentences.

A Proceeds of Crime Act hearing is scheduled for Izegbune to be heard in September.

Speaking
 after sentencing Andy Radcliffe, from the Home Office’s Criminal and 
Financial Investigations Team, said: 'Izegbune thought he could profit 
from abusing the marriage system and the UK’s immigration laws.

'He
 was seen by the other individuals as their ticket to either stay in the
 UK, or gain financially. But all five are now behind bars.

'We
 will continue to work with registrars to tackle this issue. The message
 to anyone involved in this sort of criminality is clear.

'The Home Office has the resource and expertise to catch up with you and bring you to justice.'
