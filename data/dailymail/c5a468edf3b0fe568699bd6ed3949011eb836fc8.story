Venezuelan jails have banned visitors from bringing in suitcases - after guards busted a contortionist criminal trying to escape.

Convicted murderer Gavinson Garcia - who stands at just 5ft 3ins - folded himself into the bag brought to Yare II prison in Caracas by his girlfriend Susana Blanco on Sunday.

But their plan was foiled when guards spotted Blanco, 22, struggling to move the wheeled luggage as she walked towards the prison gates.

Busted: Convicted murderer Gavinson Garcia folded himself up inside a suitcase brought to prison by his girlfriend Susana Blanco. Their simplistic escape plan was foiled when guards spotted her struggling to move the luggage as she tried to leave

Suitcase escape bid: The couple pulled the stunt believing Susana Blanco would only be searched on her arrival at the Yare II prison in Venezuela, pictured, and not as she left

Unzipping the case, they found a semi-naked Garcia curled up inside, with his head between his knees, reports El Nuevo Herald.

Sources say they pulled the stunt thinking Blanco would, as was customary, only be searched on arrival to the jail and not as she left.

Lieutenant Colonel Rafael Rodriguez said Blanco had received around $1,100 for her part in the plot.

Garcia is also believed to have paid fellow prisoners around $3,175 to help him escape.

Rodriguez said: 'The lady was dragging a black travelling suitcase, but a guard noticed her physical effort on the steps.'
