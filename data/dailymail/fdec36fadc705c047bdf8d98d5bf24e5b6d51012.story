A Los Angeles-based filmmaker who made a short film last September, entitled Meet My Rapist, in an attempt to work through her latent trauma and improve her love life, says it has done exactly the opposite.

Jessie Kahnweiler, 28, made the satirical film, which quickly went viral, in response to her rape, which occurred eight years ago while she was studying in abroad in Vietnam.

'The whole point of making this film was to reclaim my inner goddess, but instead I felt further away from her than ever,' Miss Kahnweiler writes for The Huffington Post.

The film, in which she plays herself, starts with Miss Kahnweiler bumping into her rapist at the farmer's market and unfolds as the mostly silent and highly shifty man follows her throughout the rest of her day.

'Dude it's so crazy running into you, after our unforgettable night on the air mattress,' she greets him with, in faux surprise.

As the seven-minute film progresses, Miss Kahnweiler touches on a number of insensitive, but presumably common, responses she receives from people in her life in regards to the dark presence she lugs around with her.

During a job interview - in which her rapist aggravates her as he eerily stands by her shoulder - her potential boss barks: 'Hey, no one here wants an angry woman. When you come to work, you hang up your coat and leave your problems on the coat hook.'

When she confesses the rape to her best friend, she is met with an equally snide reaction: 'But were you, like, really raped? Like, were you drunk?' the ditzy blonde questions, before breaking down and sniffing, 'It just hurts because as your best friend, it really affects me.'

Miss Kahnweiler then introduces her rapist to her parents over lunch.

Not the desired effect: The comedian and filmmaker says that men now avoid her, forcing her to question whether her 'chronic openness' had officially become 'too much' for potential mates

'We've never heard Jess talk so much about a boy. You must have made quite an impression,' gushes her mother, adding, 'Welcome to the family!'

Her last stop is an appointment with her therapist, in which she confides: 'Well, [my rapist] made me hate my body... But now I'm just thin enough to wear leggings as pants.'

'Fantastic!' her syrupy therapist responds, before adopting a patronizing tone and saying: 'I think it's time to move on. So I'm going to give you a prescription... to get the f*** over your s*** - because honey, no one wants to marry a rape victim.'

Inspired by her own frustrations with not being able to get over her ordeal, Miss Kahnweiler says making the film initially helped her.

'The movie helped me confront the effect my rape had on my identity, relationships and sexuality,' she writes, adding that she was 'overwhelmed' with its reception and the support that came flooding in, particularly from other rape victims.

Her response from men, however, was another story.

Patronizing: Mirroring some of her real-life experiences, one scene portrays her fictional therapist saying 'Honey, no one wants to marry a rape victim'

Heading to the film screening's after party, excited to 'flirt with some dudes with ironic mustaches', she was surprised to find herself overwhelmingly avoided by the men who had seen the film, and was eventually forced to ask herself the question: 'Had my chronic openness officially become too much for potential mates?'

Following the party, she describes a wash of polite but awkward interactions with men; from bad dates - 'Is he apologizing on behalf of the male species that I got raped?'- to confounded hopefuls - 'My faithful booty call lost my number and my new crush claimed he was moving to Canada.'

Ultimately, she says, despite the catharsis she has gained from making the film, she realized she was still looking to men to validate her sexuality - an issue she is still dutifully working on.

All smiles: Miss Kahnweiler has since admitted that while the film was cathartic for her, it didn't change the underlying fact that she was still feeling 'unsexy' in herself - a problem she continues to explore

Miss Kahnweiler has since spoken to ELLE.com about why she thinks she was scaring men away. 'I was feeling unsexy in myself and I was projecting it onto all of these guys,' she says, adding that for a lot of men 'It's just too much.'

'I donâ€™t know if I can blame this all on my rape,' she remarks.

It comes out as comical, but there is nothing more shocking than the truth

The sparky truth-teller, who identifies herself as a true feminist, says the next hot topic she will be tackling is her eating disorder.

She admits she was 'in denial' about her bulimia for a long time, and that she coped with her rape by taking laxatives for a month immediately after her attack.

Miss Kahnweiler, who says she is currently seeing two therapists, promises to inject the same dark humor into her next project as she did with her Meet My Rapist film.

'It comes out as comical, but there is nothing more shocking than the truth,' she says.
