Brian Kennedy staged a desperate 11th hour bid on Friday night to thwart Mike Ashley’s move for control at Rangers on an incredible day in the Ibrox power battle.

The Sale Sharks owner, who joined forces with the Blue Knights in a failed attempt to take the club out of administration in 2012, staged a shock return by tabling an emergency funding offer that would see Rangers through to their AGM.

It was a response to Ashley - who this week snubbed Dave King’s £16million bail-out plan - putting forward his own offer of a loan to the crisis-hit outfit.

The Newcastle owner already has strong commercial links at the club via his retail agreements and is seen as holding the whip hand over its future as he tries to establish a boardroom powerbase.

Rangers require new income to be certain of meeting next month’s wage bill. The Ibrox board were in talks over the competing proposals on Friday night and those discussions are expected to continue over the weekend.

Rangers director Philip Nash has resigned from the Ibrox board, the club has announced to the Stock Exchange.

They will not feature Philip Nash after he resigned from the board earlier in a chaotic sequence of developments.

Finance director Nash and chief executive Graham Wallace had been targeted by Ashley in his EGM call to try and remove both men. It is understood that Wallace on Friday began a long-arranged family holiday, despite the very awkward timing given the present circumstances.

King questioned whether Nash had quit ‘as a matter of principle against something that is going on’ and also claimed Ashley’s move did not mean his own part in the power struggle was over.

The Sports Direct tycoon’s offer is thought to be worth between £2m-£3m, which would see Rangers into the New Year. There could be future funding to follow that sum.

However, if successful, Ashley wants Wallace out alongside Nash and to handpick the two directors who would take their places.

One source close to Ashley said: ‘Rangers are in serious financial difficulty and require his immediate financial help.’ There were also claims he had offered Nash the chance to stay on as a consultant but not as part of the board.

‘Rangers are in serious financial difficulty and require (Ashley's) immediate financial help,’ one source said

It is not yet clear what other terms are attached to Ashley’s offer after reports the Londoner had sought control of Rangers’ trademark rights when in talks over a loan earlier this season. His firm currently earns 49 per cent of Rangers’ retail profits.

Kennedy arrived in Glasgow on Friday as he put forward his alternative plan for short-term funding.

The Edinburgh-born businessman is willing to provide cash to keep Rangers going until their AGM, at which point there could be a new share issue.

That forms the central plank of the plan put forward by the group headed by King, but it requires the backing of 75 per cent of shareholders to gain a green light.

Crucially, King was unable to reach an agreement with Sandy Easdale, who controls a 26 per cent block, during his recent visit to the UK.

He returned to South Africa on Thursday after also revealing that Ashley – who has an 8.9 per cent stake – had blanked requests for a meeting.

The Easdale block is believed to favour Ashley’s plan, but King was remaining defiant.

‘I don’t see the offer of a short term loan by Mr Ashley affecting me in any way,’ said King, who would see to appoint two new directors and have final say over the chairman if successful.

‘Our offer is for a long-term permanent solution that can take the club forward and unite the fans and the board for the first time in many years. The board is in the final stages of reviewing our offer and I expect a definitive answer early next week.

Ashley's £2m-£3m offer would see Rangers into the New Year and there could be future funding to follow that

‘Frankly, it doesn’t seem possible that the board can do anything other than recommend it to shareholders given the dire financial circumstances and the fact that no other long-term solution is on offer.

‘Mr Ashley’s involvement (and recently announced continued commitment) with Newcastle precludes him from making a similar offer of long-term permanent equity.

‘What Mr Ashley can do is attempt to increase his vice-like grip on the Rangers brand by improving his retail position as a condition for supplying short term debt to tide the club over until our permanent funding is in place.

‘But I know that there are other investors also willing to provide bridging finance. The board will therefore not have to accept punitive terms even if Ashley attempts to oppose them.

‘We must remember that the board is ethically and legally bound to act in the best interest of the company and all shareholders. Ashley cannot expect preferential treatment and will not get it.’

Nash was brought on board to try and stem the flow of money out of Rangers. It is expected that accounts likely to be issued next month will show that operating losses under his tenure were almost halved from the £14m of the previous financial year.

A statement to the Stock Exchange confirmed his resignation and added: ‘The Board would like to thank Mr Nash for his significant contribution to the Company during what has been a particularly challenging period.’
