It’s a procedure doctors have been using for a long time, but now it’s finally been approved.

Botox to treat wrinkles around the corners of the eyes – also known as ‘crow’s feet’ - was officially sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday.

Crow's feet are thought to be caused by repeated muscle contractions over a lifetime through facial expressions like frowning, smiling and squinting.

'This additional indication will provide people with a new FDA approved treatment option for those seeking a smoother appearance by temporarily minimising the appearance of crow’s feet at the sides of the eyes,' said Susan Walker, director of the Division of Dermatology and Dental Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in the FDA statement.

Approved: Botox can now be legally applied to smooth wrinkles around the eyes

Signs of aging: Botox was first approved as a cosmetic in 2002 for temporary improvement of frown lines - the wrinkles between the eyebrows

Botox has been used for decades by opthalmologists to treat eyelid twitching, or blepharospasm, according to Dr. Jennifer Walden.

The Texas-based aesthetic plastic surgeon, told CBSNews.com that this is one of the ways doctors discovered it could smooth the skin.

While this new FDA approval for Botox only came Wednesday, Walden said, ‘doctors have been using it off-label for years to smooth the crow's feet’.

The new FDA approval came following a study of 833 adults conducted by the drug's manufacturer, Allergan Inc. of Irvine, California, where participants were randomly assigned to receive a Botox or a placebo injection.

People treated with Botox had greater reductions in crow's feet.

A few celebrities have admitted to using Botox, including the likes of Nicole Kidman, Kim Kardashian, Simon Cowell, Kim Catrall and Sharon Osbourne.

Kim Kardashian: 'I’m totally not against plastic surgery. I’ve tried Botox before. That’s the only thing that 
I’ve done.'

Sharon Osbourne: 'I think that Botox is one of the best things that’s ever been created for cosmetic surgery.'

Botox (onabotulinumtoxinA) is a protein and neurotoxin and is the most acutely toxic substance known.

However,
 when injected directly into a muscle in approved doses, Botox prevents 
muscles from tightening by temporarily paralysing them, which in turn 
makes wrinkles disappear – for up to six months.

Botox
 was first approved as a cosmetic by the FDA in 2002 for temporary 
improvement of frown lines - the wrinkles between the eyebrows, also 
known as glabellar lines.

The most common side effect seen was eyelid edema, which causes the eyelids to become swollen due to fluid buildup.

Nicole Kidman says she no longer uses Botox: 'I 
didn’t like how my face looked afterwards. Now I don’t use it anymore – I
 can move my forehead again.'

Kim Catrall: 'I have a big crease between my eyebrows and I use Botox to get rid of 
that, but that’s kind of it. I’m 51 and I think I look my age, but I 
don’t want to be 20 anymore or even 30 or 40'.

Simon Cowell: 'I've had Botox, but then again pretty much everyone I know has. To me, Botox is no more unusual than toothpaste. It works. You do it once a year, who cares?'

Botox labels contain the strongest warning the FDA offers saying the effects of the toxin may spread from the area of injection to other areas of the body.

However the FDA said there has never been a confirmed serious case of this happening when Botox is used at recommended doses.

According to Dr Marco Harmaty, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon at The Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City, Botox has been frequently used for crow's feet and other unapproved areas of the face, like the side of the nose.

The FDA's new approval ‘does give you an added benefit and safety of saying that I'm not doing anything illegal or potentially harmful’, he said to CBSNews.com.

Botox for cosmetic purposes still likely won't be covered by insurers, given it is used for cosmetic purposes.

Insurers often cover people who have approved medical conditions treated by Botox, including chronic migraines, severe underarm sweating and others.
