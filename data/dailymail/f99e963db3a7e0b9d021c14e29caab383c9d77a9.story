A magnitude 6 earthquake that rocked its way through the Napa Valley may have also christened a baby born seconds before with his new name.

Mother Connie Navarro told reporters they are considering naming the boy 'Ruamoko,' the Maori word for earthquake.

Nurses told KPIX 5 the quake was so bad they had to guard the baby from falling debris.

Mother Connie Navarro told reporters they are considering naming the boy 'Ruamoko,' the Maori word for earthquake, an event he was born just moments ahead of in Napa

KTLA reports the earthquake hit at about 3:20 a.m. Sunday and injured about 200 people.

Four homes were destroyed along with various other property damage, and the early estimates say between $500 million and $1 billion in damage was recorded.

The U.S. Geological survey reports the area was then hit by dozens of aftershocks.

Around that same hospital of Queen of the Valley, dozens of people injured in the quake were being treated.

Early estimates put the cost of the damage at between $500 million and $1 billion

Among those injuries was Steven Smith, a 20-year-old wine cellar employee who's head and left arm were sliced open when the quake spilled a 26-gallon fish tank over him.

Smith had been sleeping at a friend's house that morning when the earthquake hit.

The fish tank, which had been set on a metal stand, rocked over, leaving him with injuries severe enough to require a hospital visit, KPIX 5 reports.
