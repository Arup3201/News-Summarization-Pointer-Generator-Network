Wolfsburg have made it clear they have no intention of selling Ricardo Rodriguez, despite rumours linking the Swiss left-back with a move to Manchester United.

New United boss Louis van Gaal is believed to be interested in bolstering his defence, particularly the left-back spot following Patrice Evra's switch to Juventus.

The Premier League side spent £30million on Luke Shaw from Southampton earlier in the summer, but are expected to sign competition for the English full-back before the start of the league season.

Reports from Germany suggest United have contacted Rodriguez's agent about a possible move, but Wolfsburg's sporting director Klaus Allofs has ruled out a potential transfer.

'That will have been a bried conversation', Allofs told Kicker when asked about United's meeting with Rodriguez's agent. 'Ricardo is not going anywhere.'

The 22-year-old joined the Bundesliga side in January 2012 from FC Zurich and has since established himself as a key player for both club and country.

His current deal with Wolfsburg expires in 2016.
