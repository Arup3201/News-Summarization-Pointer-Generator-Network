A host of the world's top bosses have joined forces for the annual managers' meeting held at UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland.

On Wednesday and Thursday, former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson chaired the 16th Elite Club Coaches Forum meeting as UEFA's coaching ambassador while president Michel Platini was also present.

Ferguson was pictured sharing a joke with former nemesis Arsene Wenger, while Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini was also snapped at the event.

However, Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal and Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers did not attend the gathering.

The meet-up is often exclusive to bosses whose sides are in European competition this term, which would exclude Van Gaal.

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho attended the meeting as well as former Stamford Bridge bosses Andre Villas-Boas, Rafael Bentiez and Carlo Ancelotti.

Luis Enrique sat next to former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola and will be hoping he can emulate the success enjoyed by one of his predecessors in the Nou Camp hotseat.

The meeting - which was first held in 1999 - allows Europe's top coaches to discuss different points in the game, including various club competitions, refereeing issues and to debate the game's overall development.

The conference has become a yearly fixture on the UEFA calendar at the start of each season, making a contribution to the continental body's decision-making processes. 

Sevilla boss Unai Emery, AC Milan manager Filippo Inzaghi and Laurent Blanc - who has been in the Paris Saint-Germain hotseat for just over a year - were among the guests.

UEFA's chief refereeing officer Pierluigi Collina and UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino were also on hand for the discussions.
