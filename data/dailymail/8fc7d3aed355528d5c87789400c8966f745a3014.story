England's World Cup slogan has been revealed as The Dream Of One Team, The Heartbeat Of Millions.

The message will be displayed on the team bus in Brazil after fans voted for their favourite from a shortlist compiled by FIFA.

It's not a bad start for Roy Hodgson's boys compared with some of the other nations.

Up and down: The Aussies are set to hop their way into history, according to their slogan

Australia are not fancied to do much damage in the tournament after being drawn alongside Spain, Holland and Chile in Group B but at least they'll give everyone a giggle as they go Hopping Our Way Into History.

As for the Dutch, they can't laugh too hard as they'll have Real Men Wear Orange plastered all over their bus. Hear that, Arjen Robben? Real men. So, no collapsing like an accordion when an opponent brushes past you.

Real men wear orange: The Dutch fans always bring a huge splash of colour to matches

Real women wear orange too: As this picture from the 2010 World Cup in South Africa proves

Stay on your feet, Arjen: Dutch winger Robben has been known to take a tumble from time to time

As for the French, they're all over the place. Impossible Is Not A French Word say our amis from across the channel. Sorry to disappoint, but it is in the pocket French dictionary.

Perhaps they should have asked Samir Nasri's girlfriend for help. Upon hearing her man had been left out of the squad for Brazil by boss Didier Deschamps, Anara Atanes had a message of her own.

F*** France, f*** Deschamp,' she tweeted.

Maybe not.

Anger: Atanes also let rip after her boyfriend Nasri was left out of the France squad

Heartbeat of Millions: The England team's slogan certainly won''t be the worst on show in South America

Elsewhere, Bosnia and Herzegovina have gone all Game Of Thrones for their first appearance at the greatest show on earth with Dragons In Heart, Dragons On The Field while Cameroon remind us that A Lion Remains A Lion.

And if you see the Ivory Coast coming, get out the way of the Elephants Charging Towards Brazil.

The prize for the least amount of thought must go to Chile for CHI CHI CHI!, LE LE LE! Go Chile, while the attitude of the laid-back South Koreans has to be admired. Enjoy It, Reds is their motto.

The full list is below but it's the Aussies sparking the biggest backlash with Socceroos across the country cringing in unison at Hopping Our Way Into History.

The words will be displayed on the team's tour bus which will be their mode of transportation around Brazil

Twitter backlash: Fans instantly slammed the slogan on social media

One Twitter user wrote: 'Who was the muppet who came up with our slogan for the World Cup? Hopping our way to world embarrassment for sure'.

Another also expressed his hatred for the slogan, writing: 'Why must we keep embarrassing ourselves on a global stage, Hopping our way into history.. Really'.

'Why must we keep embarrassing ourselves?' Fans weren't shy about expressing their disgust

Meanwhile a competition run under the hashtag Better World Cup Slogans, quickly popped up with the site's users trying to outdo each other with the most witty and insulting new slogans.

'What would beating us *really* achieve?' one user suggested, while another offered: 'Can't defend our goal. Can defend our borders. Brutally.'

But is Australia's new slogan really the worst of the lot?
