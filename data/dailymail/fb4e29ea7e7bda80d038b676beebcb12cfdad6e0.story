A celebration that started with wedding bells ended with police sirens as a result of a massive brawl that broke out in an upstate New York country club over the weekend.

Seven different police agencies were called in late Saturday to break up the fight at the Orchard Park Country Club.

Officers say about half of the approximately 200 guests were involved in the melee, which erupted after a member of the wedding party was tossed off the premises for inappropriate behavior.

Reception rumble: A wedding celebration at Orchard Park County Club in Buffalo ended in a bloody fight involving dozens of people   

Ambulance crews treated several people for injuries, including a 39-year-old man who was taken to a Buffalo hospital for treatment of a head wound.

Police say damage to the banquet room included holes in walls, blood stains and broken crystal bowls.

No arrests have been reported as of Tuesday morning, but the investigation continues.

According to reporting by The Buffalo News, a manager at the banquet hall denied that any incident had taken place, even though police officers and witnesses described a chaotic scene at the reception Saturday night.

When MailOnline contacted the venue by phone Tuesday, a manager said: 'we have no comment on that. Thank you very much.'

People who responded to the reception hall on South Buffalo Street in Orchard Park Saturday told The Buffalo News that up to 100 guests came to blows at the end of the celebration at around 11pm.

‘I’m telling you, there was blood everywhere,’ said a man who worked at the venue that night. ‘There was holes punched in the walls. Words couldn’t describe it. Just when you thought it was over, another fight started.’

Police were first called to the country club about 40 minutes before the fracas to remove an unruly guest who was punched in the face after being accused of touching someone's girlfriend.

Shortly after 11pm, the Orchard Park Police Department was flooded with 911 calls from the wedding venue about a massive brawl, which broke out as guests were preparing to leave.

Responding officers encountered an out-of-control fight involving dozens of family members and guests.

The altercation was so massive that reinforcements had to be called in from Hamburg, East Aurora, Cheektowaga, West Seneca, Erie County Sheriff's Office and State Police.

By all accounts, the reception turned into a chaotic scene, with people punching one another, breaking dishes and screaming profanities.

The unidentified bride was reportedly escorted off the premises to shield her from the fighting while her newlywed husband remained behind screaming at the brawlers to disperse.

The fisticuffs left a 39-year-old man with a head injury that required hospitalization, but the other brawlers refused medical treatment.
