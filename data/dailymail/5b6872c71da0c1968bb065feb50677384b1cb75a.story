Robin Roberts will ring in 2014 on the stunning Turks and Caicos Islands - while on a romantic getaway with girlfriend Amber Laign.

The GMA anchor, who yesterday revealed her long-term relationship with the 39-year-old blonde massage therapist, has posted a picture of herself gazing into the ocean as the sun sets over the beach.

And after saying she was looking forward to celebrating a 'glorious new year' with Amber, Robin wrote: 'My loved ones and I thank the beautiful people of Turks & Caicos for your hospitality.#SweetSerenity'.

Robin and Amber also spent Christmas on the beach as the 53-year-old star said she was 'grateful to be with loved ones', posting a picture of a sign propped up on the sand, reading: 'Let it Snow Somewhere Else!'

Today,
 Amber's family told MailOnline they were happy and supportive of the 
couple's romance, as Amber's mother Andrea Laign revealed she and her 
husband Paul had met Robin and given their blessing to the relationship.

Speaking from the family home in Clayton, near Concord, Northern California, Mrs Laign said: 'We are very, very happy for them. Her dad and I and the whole family are very happy and totally supportive.'

For the past 10 years, Robin kept her romance with Amber out of the spotlight - until she 
chose to publicise their relationship yesterday.

However,
 Amber has secretly been by Robin's side and has joined her at a string 
of public events - watching on proudly as she sat next to her 
girlfriend's sisters as the GMA anchor was honoured with the ESPN's 
Arthur Ashe Award For Courage in in July.

Let it be hot: Robin Roberts and her loved ones spent Christmas on the beach

In love: GMA star Robin Roberts thanks Amber for her love and support in a sweet Facebook message she posted last month

Amber, a massage therapist who 
studied with the Swedish Institute of Health Sciences, graduated from 
Clayton Valley High School in 1992. The family moved to California from 
 Lebanon, New Jersey, where Amber attended the Round Valley Middle 
School.

In a rare public appearance, Amber, 39, looked elegant with her blonde hair swept up and wearing a grey gown, as she sat sandwiched in between Robin's sisters Sally-Ann and Dorothy and 
was caught on camera at the ESPN awards in July.

The
 pair were also pictured together as they arrived at the Women's 
Basketball Coaches Association awards in Covington, Georgia, where Robin
 annually hands out her broadcasting scholarship award.

And as Robin appeared on 
the Oscars red carpet in February - Amber was at Sir Elton John's Oscar 
bash, where they were later reunited.

They do live together at Robin's multi-million dollar apartment on Manhattan's Upper West side - however, Amber does own her own home.

Cancer survivor Robin, 53, thanked her girlfriend as part of a heartfelt end-of-year 
thank you addressed to fans and loved ones posted to her Facebook.

'I
 am grateful for my entire family, my long time girlfriend, Amber, and 
friends as we prepare to celebrate a glorious new year together,' 
Roberts wrote.

And Amber, a massage therapist, looks equally in love with Robin as they enjoyed a vacation together and even posted 'selfies' while on vacation in Hawaii with friends in August. They have also enjoyed trips to Fire Island together.

A source told MailOnline that Robin told ABC bosses of her decision to come out on Sunday morning, adding: 'This was all Robin, she gave ABC a heads up on Sunday morning and told them she was going to post her message on Facebook. Of course she had everyone's support.'

Robin is the most popular woman on breakfast TV and her Q score - which measures the appeal of a celebrity - was most recently tested at 29 with adult women at 23 with adults over 18. In contrast, Savannah Guthrie on NBC's Today's show Q score is 12 with adults and 11 with women.

Meanwhile, Robin was inundated with messages of support from fellow celebs, including openly gay Ellen DeGeneres, who tweeted: 'Good Morning, America! Congratulations, Robin Roberts.'

According to a release sent out by ABC News shortly after Roberts' sly Facebook announcement, Roberts and Laign have been together for 10 years.

The pair met through mutual friends.

The happy couple share a New York City apartment, but 39-year-old Laign is originally from the Bay Area.

Laign is a massage therapist in private practice in New York and works to help patients with injuries to recuperate.

Prior to becoming a massage therapist, a Linkedin profile shows that Laign worked in the fashion world as a sales representative at Berger and Stevens, a New York City fashion showroom.
