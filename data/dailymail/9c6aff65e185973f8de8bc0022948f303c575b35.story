Italian giants AC Milan have released initial plans for a new 48,000 capacity stadium with the club set to move away from the ground share with rivals Inter.

The club revealed earlier this week that they had made a bid for the land in the urban area of Portello and hope to open the ground in 2018-19.

It is estimated that the project, that will involve redevelopment of the area including a hotel, a sports college and surrounding restaurants, will cost up to £240million.

Seven-time European Cup winners Milan have played in their current home, the San Siro, since the 1920s and, after selling the ground to the city of Milan, began sharing with local rivals Inter in 1947.

The San Siro, which holds more than 80,000 spectators, was officially renamed the Giuseppe Meazza Stadium after the famous Italian striker that played for both Inter and AC Milan in the 1920, 30s and 40s.

The new stadium - by architects Arup, who  also designed Bayern Munich's Allianz Arena and the Bird's Nest stadium in Beijing - would be located just two-and-a-half miles from the San Siro.

The club say the team behind the project studied more than 70 stadiums across the world and will share similarities with the English model in terms of access and security, while architect Emilio Faroldi says the stadium plan was inspired by Arsenal's Emirates Stadium.

Milan announced that they are dedicated to providing an environmentally friendly stadium, that will be accessible by public transport in an attempt to reduce traffic flow and would be surrounded by green areas  open to the public all year round.

The new venue will be made to look more like a building than a football ground and will be designed in a way that blends seamlessly into the architecture of the surrounding buildings.

The height of the new stadium will not exceed 30m, in contrast to the San Siro which stands at 60m, and will even sit 10m below ground level to reduce the visual impact on the city. 

The very latest technology and soundproof materials will be used in a bid to keep noise from within the stadium on match days to a minimum to those on the outside.

Final approval of the plans is expected in March.
