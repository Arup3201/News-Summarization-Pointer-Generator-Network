Angelcare Monitors Inc. is voluntarily recalling 600,000 baby monitors following the death of two infants due to strangulation.

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday that a cord attached to the sensor pad, which is placed under the crib mattress to monitor movement, poses a strangulation risk if the child pulls the cord into the crib.

Two infants have died from cord strangulation deaths with this product and two more have reportedly been entangled, but not fatally.

Recalled: 600,000 baby monitors have been recalled after two babies died from strangulation by AngelCare baby monitor cords

The Angelcare Movement and Sound Monitors with Sensor Pads were sold between 1999 and 2013 for between $100 and $300 at a number of U.S. retailers, including Babies R Us, Toys R Us, Burlington Coat Factory, Meijer, Sears, Walmart, Amazon.com, Target.com, Overstock.com and nearly 70 small baby specialty stores.

Consumers should stop using the product and contact the company for a repair kit.

The recall involves all versions of Angelcare sensor monitors including model numbers: AC1100, AC201, AC300, AC401 AC601 and 49255 that did not include rigid cord covers.

The model number is located on the back of the nursery monitor unit.

Unsafe: The CPSC reports that industr-ywide there have been eight reports of strangulation from baby monitor cords since 2002

Angelcare, based in Canada, is providing consumers with a repair kit that includes rigid protective cord covers, through which the sensor pad cords can be threaded, as well as a new electric cord warning label and revised instructions.

The CPSC said that industry-wide there have been eight reports of strangulation in baby monitor cords since 2002.

The first death occurred in August 2004 in Salem, Oregon when an eight-month-old girl was strangled.

The second occurred in 2011, when 13-month-old Vincenza Marie Porretta died in San Diego, California after her mother found her with the cord of the monitor wrapped so tightly around her neck that she had trouble removing it.

Both babies died after pulling the cord from the sensor pad into their cribs.
