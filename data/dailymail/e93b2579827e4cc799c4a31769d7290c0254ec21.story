A riot squad officer accused of killing Ian Tomlinson was outwitted by a protester in front of a jeering crowd just minutes before he hit the newspaper vendor, a court heard today.

Constable Simon Harwood, 45, tried to arrest a man dressed in black who he saw writing 'all cops are b******s' on the side of a police vehicle during the G20 protests in the City of London in April 2009.

But the demonstrator managed to wriggle free, leaving Harwood holding his jacket.

Today Constable Andrew Hayes, who was driving a police carrier that day, told Southwark Crown Court Harwood was 'almost in a tug of war' with the man.

He said protesters turned hostile as soon as Harwood tried to make the arrest in Cornhill.

'There was jeering going on and I felt at that point the crowd was chasing PC Harwood down the street.

The court was shown film footage of Ian Tomlinson's journey that day using video from various CCTV cameras across London up to the moment he walks past PC Simon Harwood - who is seen primed in a strike position behind him

'Since he had taken hold of the person in black it had become more hostile and was directed towards PC Harwood.

'The gentleman that he had hold of wiggled out of his jacket, and left PC Harwood holding the jacket.'

Jurors were played film footage of the man being marched past PC Hayes’ carrier, and colliding with the driver’s door to jeers from the crowd.

PC Hayes said: 'I’ve gone to get out, opened the driver’s door and something collided with the driver’s door.

'I could see it was PC Harwood and the person in the black.'

Around 15 minutes later Harwood, from Carshalton in Surrey, encountered Mr Tomlinson near the Royal Exchange Buildings, hit him with his baton and pushed him to the ground

Mr Tomlinson, 47, walked 70 metres before collapsing, and died in hospital under an hour later.

Harwood denies manslaughter and maintains that he used reasonable force in the circumstances.

In a previous statement, PC Hayes said the crowd were aiming kicks and punches at Harwood as he attempted to make the arrest.

Today a film clip was played showing one man apparently trying to trip him over as he struggled to keep hold of the protester.

PC Hayes said he thought hundreds of members of the crowd were chasing Harwood.

Earlier the court heard from witnesses who saw Mr Tomlinson as he blocked a police van in Lombard Street shortly after 7pm.

Passer-by James Stone said he looked 'gaunt with glazed eyes' and was 'very slow to react', looking 'dazed and confused' when police officers told him to move on.

He said he thought 'boy, does he look wasted', and that he was surprised to see Mr Tomlinson lose his balance when gently pushed by an officer.

Constable Dean Cocks, who moved Mr Tomlinson out of the path of the police vehicle on to the pavement, said 'it was a low-level use of force'.

PC Cocks said: 'I was more than happy that the level of force that I had used was reasonable and necessary given the circumstances.

'There might have been a bit of resistance but nothing that you wouldn’t expect from someone who was drunk.

'He was drunk, he was making a nuisance of himself and he was obstructing police in the course of their duty.'

Constable Neil Finnis told jurors Mr Tomlinson deliberately sat on the front of the police van as he refused to get out of the way.

Later, Constable Andrew Brown turned Mr Tomlinson away from a cordon in King William Street that blocked his route home to Smithfield.

In a statement read to the court because PC Brown has since died, he said: 'The reality of the situation escaped him. I told him that he could not go past me. He stared at me, not in confrontation or disbelief but in incomprehension.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
