She has been at his side through the highs and lows of Tony McCoy's incredible career since they first met nearly 20 years ago.

And today was no different for Chanelle as she watched her husband  make his final Cheltenham Festival appearance.

She was going through her own emotional journey as the legendary jockey galloped through the field - desperately trying to clinch his third Gold Cup before his retirement from the sport in April.

But the joy of victory they have both become accustomed to turned to sadness as he crossed the finish line in ninth place.

Over the last two decades, McCoy has dominated horse racing with 19 career championships and 31 winners at Cheltenham alone.

Anticlimax: Championship jockey Tony McCoy could not crown his final Cheltenham Festival with a Gold Cup win

Final days: McCoy said he would retire at the end of the 2014/15 season and his final racecourse appearance will be the Bet365 Gold Cup meeting at Sandown in April 2015

Today, he was cheered on by a roaring crowd and even royalty such as Princess Anne, her son Peter, Zara Philips and her husband - Rugby World Cup winner Mike Tindall.

A host of famous faces including musical director Andrew Lloyd Webber, football commentator John Motson and professional dancer Ola Jordan were also in attendance among the frenzied crowd.

But McCoy could not produce the glorious ending they all wanted - losing out to eventual winner Coneygree ridden by Nico de Boinville.

But the 40-year-old who is widely regarded as the greatest jockey of all time will still end of the season as champion for the 20th consecutive time.

An emotional McCoy admitted after jump racing's biggest meet that the Cheltenham Festival will never be the same for him again.

After receiving a special presentation in the winner's enclosure, he said: 'It's disappointing that I won't ever be riding at the Festival again.

'That's something I never wanted to think would happen. It was not something I was ever going to look forward to, that's for sure. It's going to be very different when I come back here next year.  

'There'll be some sadness when I do come back not as a jockey, but I love a sport that's been very good to me... Cheltenham is an amazing place with amazing people.'

McCoy said: 'I knew when we got here this morning we were in trouble. He's a horse that likes good ground and  he doesn't like it when it turns into a drag 

'It was an unbelievable performance from a novice chaser. He got them at it early and stuck at it well.'

'This is something I'm really going to miss,' added McCoy who was given a reception fit for a champion after the last race at Cheltenham.

Just as in the previous three days, the Northern Irishman who has stood head and shoulders above the competition for 20 years was saluted before and after every race.

But on his this chilly and damp afternoon, the man who has ridden over 4,300 winners finished 'unplaced' on his Gold Cup hope Carlingford Lough.

He said: 'It's probably just now that it's hit me that I won't be riding at the Festival ever again. That's quite tough.'

McCoy will bow out with 31 Cheltenham Festival winners to his name, the first coming in 1996 and his final one on Thursday with a fine ride on Uxizandre in the Ryanair Chase.

The 40-year-old said it was the 'adrenaline rush' from wins like that he would miss the most, adding: 'It was brilliant for Uxizandre to give me the thrill I got. 

Looking back on his Cheltenham memories, McCoy picked out his second Gold Cup win on Synchronised in 2012 - 15 years after his first on Mr Mulligan - as the best moment.
