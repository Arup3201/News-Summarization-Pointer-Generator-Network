Megan Ward, 19, from Birmingham has never been able to have an orgasm

A student has told of the frustration of living with a  condition called 'anorgasmia' - which leaves her unable to have an orgasm.

Megan Ward, 19, has never reached sexual climax and has been unable to overcome the problem, despite receiving expert help.

The condition is believed to be related to general anxiety and Megan says it has put her off sex entirely at certain times.

Writing  on student website The Tab, she said: 'I have never, not once, not by myself, not with a partner, not with a vibrator, had an orgasm.

'I guess it's impossible to know what you're missing out on when you've never had one, so it's hard to want something you can't imagine.'

After suffering for so long, Megan sought help from a sexual therapist last March.

She said: 'Sex therapy is a specialised form of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.

'What you do is try to change some of what they call your 'maladaptive thinking patterns' towards sex.

'There are a whole host of reasons why women develop anorgasmia, and different ways of it manifesting.

'Some don't even get close to coming, and it's often a lack of stimulation which causes it (basically, the guy being bad in bed).

'This isn't the case with me. I have four different kinds of vibrators, I am very well stimulated, thank you.

'When I get close, it's like a wall is put up in my head and I involuntarily force all stimulation to stop.

'Everything that was turning me on suddenly repulses me and I just can't continue.

'Something subconsciously is telling me I can't have an orgasm, so the therapist will talk to me and try to 'rewire' my brain and how it thinks about sex.'

Megan, pictured with a friend, was so frustrated with her inability to climax that starting visiting a sex therapist 

Despite the therapy, the Birmingham student didn't make any progress and after eight sessions, she stopped going.

'My therapist had, at the start, been confident that I wasn't the one woman in 20 who never climaxes.

'But as the weeks went by, and nothing was getting better, we both got confused and frustrated.

'I was using the methods I had been told and it still wasn't happening. I was a failure.

'That was the only way I could see it. My body was meant to be able to do this apparently wonderful thing but it couldn't.

'The therapy, which worked for others, wasn't working for me, so I was a double failure. I couldn't handle that. I quit after eight sessions.'

Megan completely lost her sex drive and it put an immense amount of pressure on her relationship.

He boyfriend stuck with her throughout the lowest points though, and the pair once again enjoy an active sex life.

She now plans to go back to therapy in the hope that she can have even better sex in the future.

'I once described my missing orgasm as missing the cherry on top of an ice cream sundae, only to be told the orgasm was the sundae everything else was the cherry on top,' she said.

'I want my damn sundae.'
