Rolf Harris's wife Alwen Hughes has visited her disgraced paedophile husband in his Oxfordshire prison.

She was photographed outside Bullingdon prison in Oxfordshire being escorted inside by Jenny Harris and a male friend.

The 82-year-old was sheltered under an umbrella by one as, using a stick, she was walked from a car inside the compound.

Mrs Harris, who attended almost every day of Harris's lengthy trials for indecent assault, seemed to put on a brave face before seeing Harris, who is serving a six-year prison sentence for 12 indecent assaults on four girls.

The disgraced entertainer is applying for permission to appeal against his conviction.

Yesterday a spokesman for the Judicial Office confirmed that lawyers for the 84-year-old had lodged papers at the Court of Appeal this week.

Jailed: Harris was given a five year, nine-month prison sentence, against which he hopes to appeal

His victims include an eight-year-old autograph hunter, two on girls in their early teens and a catalogue of abuse of his daughter's friend over 16 years.

Harris, who will serve just under three years in prison under the current terms of his sentence, has been spat at by another inmate at HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire, but was not hurt.

He has already been stripped of a Bafta fellowship and faces losing his prestigious CBE in the wake of his conviction, and his multi-million pound fortune is also at risk from potential compensation claims.

The court will now consider whether to grant permission for him to continue with his appeal bid.

Harris, a family favourite for decades, was finally unmasked as a predator who was fixated with under-age girls during his trial, with jurors told how his 16-year campaign of sex abuse against his daughter's friend 'haunted' her and made her abandon her dreams as he continued to be adored by millions of fans worldwide.

His fall from grace was underlined as he was stripped of a Bafta fellowship and accolades in his native Australia were removed, and he faces losing his prestigious CBE.

The performer's multi-million pound fortune is also at risk from potential compensation claims.

Unmasked: Harris was convicted of 12 counts of indecent assault, and has been stripped of awards and accolades since

Harris was jailed for five years and nine months for the sex abuse, meaning that he is due to serve just under three years for the crimes, which spanned between 1968 and 1986.

Earlier this week the Attorney-General's Office confirmed that the sentence would not be referred to the Court of Appeal for being unduly lenient.

Attorney General Jeremy Wright decided not to take action despite his office receiving 150 complaints about the leniency of Harris's sentence, of which he will serve half, although it only takes one complaint to trigger the review process.
