Anyone planning a Thanksgiving trip has been warned to set off early to avoid a devastating nor'easter set to to pour snow and rain on the East Coast the day before Thanksgiving.

Travelers whose journeys include the busy highways linking the major cities along the eastern seaboard were told to dodge the incoming storm - now brewing over the Atlantic - by traveling on Tuesday instead of Wednesday if they can.

Some predictions have said that as much a six inches of snow could coat Boston, New York City and Washington, D.C., this week - causing travel chaos down the I-95 corridor.

Start of the week: Rains will fall in New England to begin with, but a new system from the south will bring more rainfall

Closer: The system from the south-east Atlantic will bring rains along with it, which could later turn to snow

Dangerous: Thunderstorms on the south coast and bands of rain and snow in the Northeast will strike Wednesday, making for millions of difficult journeys home

Feast day: Thanksgiving itself is set to feature some snow along the eastern seaboard as well, though much of the country will be clear

Robert Sinclair Jr, a spokesman for the AAA in New York, said Monday: 'I would pack your patience'. 

He then suggested some of the 41.3million travelers expected to hit the roads this weekend could lessen the stress by moving a different day.

Precipitation was forecast to sweep in from the south Tuesday night into Wednesday morning and exit the region Thursday morning.

Jeff Masters, chief meteorologist for Weather Underground, said coastal cities are likely to mostly receive rain, although he cautioned Monday afternoon that meteorologists would be keeping a close eye on the rain/snow line.

'A small deviation in the track could change things dramatically,' he said.

As of Monday, the highest amount of snow was expected to fall in northeastern Pennsylvania, the Catskills of upstate New York and into Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine.

Ten inches was possible in some places, forecasters said.

Storm's on the way: A powerful storm which could make its way across the eastern coast Wednesday, shown above with its center over North Carolina and yawning out over the East coast, has the potential to slow down planes and highways

It came as winds over the Midwest and towards the east of the country caused early delays for those heading home at the start of the week.

The Federal Aviation Administration reported delays Monday morning at New York LaGuardia, Boston Logan, Chicago O'Hare and Philadelphia airports from 16 to 45 minutes. 

On the prospect of Thanksgiving storms, the National Weather Service said: 'Heads up to snow lovers and for those planning on traveling around Thanksgiving this week...

'Models continue to show the potential for a mid-week storm to ride up the East coast Wednesday into Thursday. Accumulating snow will be possible across the Mid-Atlantic and into the Northeast.'

A later update said: 'On Wednesday, a developing low pressure center off the Southeast coast will rapidly intensify as it moves parallel to the east coast. The track of the low remains uncertain.

Bundle up! Indicated in red are possible areas which may see snowfall this week. The severity of a storm system  during the middle of this week will be based on its proximity to the coast

Delays: High winds across the Midwest and east of the country have been causing flight delays

Delays: Flights at eastern airports Monday were being held by up to 45 minutes due to high winds

'A band of snow will likely develop on the northwest side of the storm, but the location of that band is highly dependent on the track of the storm.'

More than 46million Americans are expected to take major trips around Thanksgiving, the highest figure in seven years.

The AAA said that traveler volumes will rise another 4.2 per cent on 2013 levels, and will see families make an average journey of 50 miles.

A large majority of travelers - 89 per cent - will go by car, with 8 per cent commuting by airplane, and other methods making up the final 3 per cent.

Overall, the day before Thanksgiving - and Thanksgiving itself - are among the busiest travel days of the year, close to Christmas and summer vacation periods.

According to government statistics, the average Thanksgiving long-distance trip length is 214 miles (for Christmas it is 275), and even long-distances travelers tend only to spend three nights away.

Thanksgiving itself is actually a busier day for travel than the day before, as the majority of those with less than 100 miles to travel do so without staying the night. 

Aid: Buffalo fireman from Engine 25 try to locate a fire hydrant on the corner of Paul Pl and Seneca Street

Around Buffalo, New York, residents last week buried in as much as seven feet of snow are still feeling the after-effects as temperatures climb and threaten to bring floods. 

The National Weather Service said roads could flood quickly from snow melt since the storm blocked drains, and issued warnings for potential flooding of four rivers and creeks.

'Snowmelt is well underway and will continue through Monday,' the weather service said on its website. 'It is this snowmelt that will ultimately cause the flooding concerns.'
