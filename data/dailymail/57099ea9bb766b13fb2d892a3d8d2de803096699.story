When Real Madrid romped to a 4-0 win against Bulgarian minnows Ludogorets on Tuesday, they became the first side to have won each of their Champions League group stage matches twice.

Los Blancos first achieved the impressive feat back in the 2011-12 season when they beat Lyon, Ajax and Dynamo Zagreb across six fixtures.

AC Milan, Barcelona, CSKA Moscow and Paris Saint-Germain have also managed to emerge victorious in every one of their group games in the past, although none of these sides have gone on to lift the trophy.

Having won 19 successive games in all competitions, Real are one of the favourites to triumph in this season's Champions League, along with Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich.

But the La Liga leaders will need to break a curse which stretches back to the 1992-93 season, when Milan lost 1-0 to Marseille in the final after cruising through a group which also included Porto, PSV and Gothenburg.

The same thing happened to  PSG two years later when, after gaining maximum points from group fixtures against Bayern, Spartak Moscow and Dynamo Kiev, the French outfit lost to Milan at the semi-final stage.

The following season Spartak Moscow eased through a group containing Legia Warsaw, Rosenborg and Blackburn Rovers before crashing out to Nantes in the last eight.

Barcelona appeared to be on course to lift the trophy in 2003 after outclassing Lokomotiv Moscow, Galatasaray and Club Brugge, only for Juventus to dump them out in the quarter-finals.

And Jose Mourinho's Real Madrid side became the fifth team to succumb to the curse when, after reaching the semi-finals, they lost to Bayern on penalties at the Bernabeu in April 2012.

The current Madrid side face a two-legged last 16 clash with either Juventus, Bayer Leverkusen, Arsenal, Manchester City, PSG, Schalke or Shakhtar Donetsk in February and March next year. 

Time will tell if one of those teams are able to defeat Ancelotti's in-form side and claim another victim for the curse of group domination.
