Swimmers at a public pool in New Zealand were evacuated after a sprightly sea lion broke inside the venue and waddled into the water. 

Footage of the bizarre scene shows several men trying to contain the animal with hockey sticks before it escapes into the lap pool and frolics around.

The 1.5 metre long female sea lion appeared at 2.30 pm on Saturday, sparking about 100 members of the public to be evacuate from St Clair Hot Salt Water Pool in Dunedin, reports the Otago Daily Times.

A crowd of swimmers can be seen watching intently as the sea lion, believed to be about three-years-old, glides joyously through the water.

The animal had been sunbaking outside a café next to the pool, before it managed to slip inside the venue undetected.

St Clair Hot Salt Water Pool supervisor Paul Swanson said 'she waddled right through reception and went into the pool.'

Ms Swanson said swimmers were not perturbed by the interruption to their day, instead taking the chance to grab some photographs of the cheeky critter.

'They're loving it ... there's going to be hundreds of pictures online,' she said.

The description for the YouTube video reads: 'The Sea Lion walked through the front entrance of the pool, had a sunbath for a while, and then was asked to leave by a guy from the Department of Conservation. Except it wanted a swim first.'

St Clair staff said a sea lion had not broken into the pool for over 10 years.

The New Zealand Sea Lion is believed to be the world's rarest breed of sea lion, with total population of only 10,000.
