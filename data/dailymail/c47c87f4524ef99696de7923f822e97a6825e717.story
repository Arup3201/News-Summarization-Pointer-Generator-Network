Paula Alderson was jailed for 16 months at Newcastle Crown Court for theft and already has 230 convictions behind her

A thief with 230 convictions to her name has been jailed for stealing while she was already serving a suspended sentence.

Paula Alderson, whose criminal record includes 100 offences of shoplifting, targeted shops across the North East, stole meat and perfume while she was on a suspended sentence, community order and bail.

Alderson, 33, was jailed for 16 months at Newcastle Crown Court yesterday.

Judge Paul Sloan QC told her: 'You have not complied, notwithstanding chance after chance that you were offered.

'You were travelling around the North East to different locations, stealing high value perfume in the main.

'This is all aggravated by your record and by the fact you were in a suspended sentence order and a community order.

'The stage has been reached where the only appropriate sentence is one of immediate custody.

'Clearly you are both unwilling and unable to comply with community requirements.'

The court heard Alderson took eight bottles of aftershave, worth £155, from Morrisons in Jarrow in July last year.

The following month she was caught on CCTV taking £110 worth of aftershave from Lloyds chemist in Seaham.

On November 16 she took 18 bottles of aftershave from Next at Dalron Retail Park in Murton.

And on January 24  this year she took £132 worth of meat from Marks and Spencer in Stockton.

Alderson, of Hendon, Sunderland, admitted the four thefts.

Prosecutor Mark Styles said: 'She travelled around the area, she is a prolific thief.

A judge at Newcastle Crown Court told Alderson: 'Clearly you are both unwilling and unable to comply with community requirements'

'She is well known at various shopping centres and banned from going in to certain ones of them.'

Paul Cross, defending, said: 'The much more recent offences were due to financial pressures rather than drugs.

'If she has been short of money the old habits kick in.'
