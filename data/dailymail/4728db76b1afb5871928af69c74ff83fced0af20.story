A Buddhist Chinese monk has caused controversy after it emerged he had accepted cash to bless a businessman's Porsche. 

Recently everything from palatial new homes to controversial business ventures are beginning to be blessed, but it was the businessman's request to have his brand-new sports car prayed over in a temple in the city of Xiaogan, in eastern China's Hubei province, that has really caused anger across the country.

Software development company boss Tao Hung brought the high-performance car to the monk so he could pray that he would drive safely in the vehicle and be 'lucky' in always reaching his destinations on time without incident.

But critics have said that the blessing goes against Buddhist tradition and that greed and money are not part of the teachings - in fact greed, hatred, and delusion are known as the three poisons.

Several people also branded the blessing pointless saying that if the man wanted to avoid accidents, he should drive slowly and take care not to count on God to do the job for him.

One commentator writing online said: 'He may have money but one wonders how he came to make it, given the fact that he shows an eminent lack of intelligence.'

The businessman himself declined to comment and the monks said that blessing means of transportation has always been part of their Buddhist tradition and there was nothing wrong with agreeing to pray that the man's Porsche delivered him safely after each journey.
