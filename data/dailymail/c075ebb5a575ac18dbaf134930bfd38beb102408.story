U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder faces hostile fire from Congress and the mass media since news emerged that his Justice Department spied on reporters from at least two press outlets while tracing the sources of national security leaks. The U.S. Constitution's First Amendment prohibits the federal government from interfering with the freedom of the press

As tempers flare among the Washington, D.C. press corps and Republicans sharpen their knives for Attorney General Eric Holder, the Department of Justice has scheduled a second sortie in its charm offensive meant to soften reporters' icy stares.

The DOJ will host a 'policy meeting' on Tuesday for publishers and general counsels of news organizations, in the hope of stemming the tide of outrage from journalists angered over what they see as the federal government's intrusion into protected free-speech territory.

The afternoon meeting, according to the invitation, is 'part of the Attorney General's 
review of existing Department of Justice guidelines governing 
investigations that involve the news media.'

It is 'one of a series 
of meetings with media and other organizations that the Attorney General
 is conducting,' DOJ said, 'as part of the policy review directed by the President.'

News emerged in May that Holder's agency secretly obtained phone records and emails from Associated Press and FOX News Channel journalists, in investigations targeting national security leaks. Neither news outlet was notified that the government was snooping on its personnel.

Reactions from the establishment news media in Washington have ranged from annoyance to outrage, with the perceived threat to First Amendment press rights bringing a new level of aggression from many reporters about the other scandals facing the Obama administration.

When MailOnline inquired about the Tuesday meeting, DOJ staff initially insisted via email that it would be an 'off the record policy meeting.'

But Holder's chief of staff, Margaret Richardson, later softened that stand in a phone call with MailOnline.

White House press secretary Jay Carney offered no direct defense of the Justice Department of Attorney General Eric Holder on Monday, but quoted the White House chief of staff doing so in a New York Times article

Sally Buzbee (L), Washington bureau chief at The Associated Press, saw phone records from 20 of her employees fall into the federal government's hands. The DOJ also seized Fox News reporter James Rosen's private emails and some of his parents' private communications

'I want to clarify a little bit,' she said. 'This "off-the-record/on-the-record" thing has taken on a life of its own.'

'We don't want to say it's on the record,' she explained, 'because we would have cameras rolling and we wouldn't have a candid exchange.'

Two similar meetings, held May 30 and 31 with news editors and Washington bureau chiefs, were also originally framed as strictly 'off the record,' a journalistic classification that would prohibit reporters from writing or broadcasting about anything that happened, or even about who was in attendance.

The first ten amendments to the U.S. Constitution, drafted March 4, 1789, are known as the Bill of Rights. What we know as the First Amendment was actually the third one listed. It includes the demand that 'Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press...'

But after pressure from some media outlets last week and a widespread boycott, the Justice Department adjusted that demand, permitting reporters to report generally on the substance of the Friday meeting, while still insisting that no participants could be quoted directly.

That placed the Obama administration in the unconventional and potentially embarrassing position of promising to guarantee press freedoms during a meeting whose participants were essentially sworn to secrecy.

Holder, The Washington Post reported 
unironically, 'said officials would seek procedural and possibly 
legislative changes to protect journalists’ First Amendment rights. ... 
The 90-minute meeting was attended by a small group of journalists after
 several news organizations objected to the Justice Department’s 
insistence that it be held off the record. The participants, however, 
reached an agreement with the Justice Department under which they could 
describe what occurred during the meeting in general terms.'

'We didn't want, especially last week when tempers were high, for there to be a transcription,' Richardson said Monday.

Rep. Darrell Issa said Sunday morning on CNN that 'it would be kind to say [Eric Holder] misled Congress' about his agency's criminal investigations targeting journalists

About Tuesday's meeting, she counseled that Holder is 'okay with people reporting on their own participation' - but not in a self-promoting
 manner. The attorney general, Richardson said, hopes not to 'lose the opportunity to have a meaningful 
policy engagement.'

'We don't want to box anyone in,' she continued. 'But we 
also don't want to create a big thing if someone reports on it and 
writes, "Can you believe that stupid question that was asked?"'

'I 
know it's a gray area, this off-the-record description,' Richardson said. 'But that would 
be our preference. We're trying to have some integrity in the policy 
process with an idea exchange.'

Tuesday's session is not going to be the same' as those held last week, she added. 'This is publishers and general 
counsels, with the expectation that their perspectives will be different
 from [those of] bureau chiefs.'

Holder's hold on his position in Washington is progressively more tenuous with each week. He personally approved a search warrant application for emails and phone records belonging to Fox reporter James Rosen, telling a federal judge that his status as a potential criminal co-conspirator trumped the government's legal requirement to alert Fox News in advance or negotiate with the leading cable news network.

The attorney general also, however, told the House Judiciary Committee during a May 15 hearing that, 'With regard to the potential prosecution of the press for the disclosure of material, that is not something I’ve ever been involved in, heard of or would think would be a wise policy.'

The U.S. Department of Justice will be the scene of Tuesday's meeting, which MailOnline will attend. The agency is under fire for secretly obtaining two months of phone records of Associated Press reporters and both phone records and emails of Fox News reporter James Rosen

Rep. Bob Goodlatte, a Virginia Republican who chairs that committee, has confirmed that he is investigating Holder's testimony to determine whether he committed perjury.

Rep. Darrell Issa, who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said Sunday on CNN that 'it would be kind to say he misled Congress.'

'It would be less kind and more accurate to say that would rise to be a lie by most people’s standards.'

The Justice Department doesn't see it that way. 'The attorney general’s testimony concerning the potential prosecution of a member of the press,' a spokesperson said, 'was accurate and consistent with the facts' related to that leak case.

Federal prosecutors, the spokesperson continued, never 'sought approval to bring criminal charges against the reporter.'

Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, has raised the specter of a perjury charge as one possible outcome of a congressional investigation into Holders testimony

White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough defended Holder in a statement Saturday to The New York Times.

Holder, he said through a spokesman, “has the intellect, experience and integrity to efficiently run the Department of Justice and not get distracted by the partisans who seem more interested in launching political attacks than cooperating with him to protect the security and constitutional rights of the American people.'

Asked Monday during a scheduled briefing for a comment on Holder's ability to remain in his job, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney referred reporters to McDonough's statement, which he said 'spoke for all of us' in the White House.

'I couldn't say it any better,' Carney said.
