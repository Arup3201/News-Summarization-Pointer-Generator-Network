Marcos Rojo has had a tough time with injuries since his summer move to Manchester United, but the defender put on a brave face as he smiled for a picture during a meal out with friends.

The 24-year-old Argentine moved to Old Trafford from Sporting Lisbon in the summer, but was ruled out for up to three months after dislocating his shoulder against Manchester City just over a fortnight ago.

But Rojo was all smiles on Wednesday, as he posed for a photo in a Manchester restaurant with two friends and his girlfriend Eugenia Lusardo.

It has been a stuttering start to life at United for the defender, as he struggled to get a work permit at the start of the season. He made his debut against QPR in September, but could only manage seven appearances before dislocating his shoulder.

His Argentina team-mates travelled to Manchester this week for an international friendly against Portugal at Old Trafford, but they lost out to a last-minute winner from Raphael Guerreiro.

As the international break comes to an end, Rojo will be watching on as United travel to Arsenal on Saturday evening, looking to continue their fight into the top four of the Premier League.
