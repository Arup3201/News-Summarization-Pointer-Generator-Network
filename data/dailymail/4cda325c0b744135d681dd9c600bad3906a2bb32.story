Climate change will wreak havoc on the world and its population, causing mass migration, malnutrition and war, according to a leaked official report.

An official publication by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which will be made public at the end of this month, paints a bleak picture of how global warming will affect the globe.

The draft report, the second of three by the IPCC, was written by hundreds of respected scientists and offers the most comprehensive look ever at the impact of climate change on the planet.

A leaked UN report warns climate change will mean more devastating floods, as happened in Pakistan in 2010

Based on thousands of studies, the paper predicts that by the end of the 21st century, 'hundreds of millions of people will be affected by coastal flooding and displaced, due to land loss', it was reported today.

It warns that such forced mass migration will lead to violent conflict, particularly in Asia, while the flooding will result in a two per cent drop in crop yields every decade for the rest of the century.

As a result, the UN report says, millions more children under the age of five will suffer from malnutrition, while people in many regions will be at greater risk of water-borne diseases, injury or death from flooding, heatwaves or fire.

The global economy will suffer, too, with global GDP predicted to drop by $1.4trn (£841billion) as a result of rising temperatures.

According to a report in the Independent, the report shows that the effect of this predicted climate change on Britain will be comparatively small, and will include rising food prices, worse air pollution leading to increased asthma and hay fever.  Also under threat are some of Scotland and Ireland's rare coastal habitats and peatlands, and Britain's grouse moors.

The report, by the IPCC's Working Group II, will be considered by the IPCC in Yokohama, Japan, on 25-29 March.  The first report came out last September, a third report, by Working Group III, will be published in the second week of April, and a final, sythesis report will be discussed in Copenhagen in October this year.

By the end of the 21st century, 'hundreds of millions of people will be affected by coastal flooding and displaced, due to land loss', the report predicts.  Rising sea levels will mean coastal flooding, submergence and coastal emergence, it says, with the worst hit areas east Asia, south-east Asia, and south Asia.

Existing health problems will be made worse by the changing climate until around 2050, the report says, after which people will face the threat of injury, water-borne disease, and death from flooding, heatwaves and fire.

Flooding and heatwaves will lead to mass migration, a key cause in conflict.  The report says increased poverty and decreasing food supplies will increase the likelihood of violent conflicts, as will migrating fish stocks from one country's territory to another, and changes in water sources and sea ice.

Air pollution, as shown in Jakarta, Indonesia, will increase as a result of climate change, the IPCC report says

The IPCC report suggests that a rise in average global temperature of 2.5C from pre-industrial levels may lead to a drastic drop in global GDP.

Even small increases of around 1C will mean a reduction in yields of maize, wheat and rice in tropical and temperate regions, the report warns, with an average reduction in yields of two per cent per decade for the rest of the century.  Meanwhile global demand is set to increase.

Coastal habitats in Scotland and Ireland, such as machair and peatlands, may be under threat from climate change, along with British grouse moors.

The draft report says that 'freshwater-related risks of climate change increase significantly with increasing greenhouse gas emissions', and says competition for freshwater will increase as renewable ground water and surface water resources dwindle.

Rare habitats, such as this machair grassy plain in Uist, Outer Hebrides, may be threatened, the report warns
