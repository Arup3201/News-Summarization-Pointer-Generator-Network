A North Carolina woman is seeking an apology after staff at a local restaurant told her to cover up while she breastfed her six-month-old son.

Karissa Riddle, 22, of Charlotte told the Gaston Gazette that she was in Qdoba Mexican Grill at Gaston Mall Tuesday breastfeeding her son. After she finished, an employee approached her and told her to cover up because the restaurant had received complaints.

'I honestly couldn't believe what I was being asked to do,' Riddle told the Gazette.

State Law: Riddle told the employee that state law allows her to breastfeed in public, but the employee told her that company policy allowed staff to ask her to cover up

Riddle told the employee that state law allows her to breastfeed in public, but the employee told her that company policy allowed staff to ask her to cover up, FOX News reports. 

Riddle says she considers herself a modest person and wasn't trying to show off her body at the restaurant. She said she was simply trying to feed her son.

The state allows women to breastfeed in any public or private place and exempts breastfeeding from public indecency laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Mike Lari, a Gastonia police captain, told the Gazette there's nothing stopping a woman from walking down the street 'completely bare breasted.'

Lari said his department rarely receives complaints from the public about breastfeeding.

Riddle hopes to get an apology from restaurant officials, and a Qdoba spokesperson said the incident is being reviewed. 

'It’s always in the back of your mind that somebody will say something,' Riddle told the Gazette. 'It’s just a slap back to reality, that we still sexualize breasts.

'It made me ashamed to be a woman.' 

The Qdoba Mexican Grill has received backlash on its Facebook page. Some have even made erroneous claims that the restaurant called the police on the woman.
