This is the astonishing story of how nine British brothers fought in the First World War and survived.

The Hanscombe brothers from Beckenham, south-east London, all volunteered to fight in the war - and they were shot, gassed, blown up and taken prisoner in France, but all returned home alive.

Their mother Sara - who was a widow when the war began in 1914 and also had a daughter - saw eight of her sons go off to the front line in Europe, while a ninth served in England.

The men’s story has been compared to World War Two film Saving Private Ryan, which sees U.S. soldiers go behind enemy lines to retrieve a paratrooper whose three brothers have been killed.

Speaking to journalist Sheron Boyle in the Sunday Mirror, the mother’s great-grandson Roy Hanscombe, of Wakefield, West Yorkshire, said: ‘Saving Private Ryan was a very moving story.

‘But it has nothing on what my family endured. My grandfather, James, and his brothers survived the war but they didn’t escape unscathed, suffering a total of 21 wounds.

‘Many large families fought in the war but I have never heard of any where all survived - my great grandmother was lucky. Someone must have been looking down on her.’

One of the brothers, Sergeant Bert Hanscombe, who won the Distinguished Conduct Medal and the Military Medal, worked as a council dustman and unveiled his town’s war memorial in 1921.

He was promoted to sergeant for his bravery at Hulluch during the Battle of Loos in France in 1915, and was one of seven men in his battalion to escape German capture at Cambrai two years later.

Another brother, George, was a 36-year-old father-of-seven when the war began, and in 1917 he was listed as missing - but it turned out he had been shot in the hip and taken prisoner in Germany.

James was wounded in the head in 1916 then again in 1917, but survived both attacks. And Richard was known for running messages to battalion headquarters at Nieppe Forest under heavy shellfire.

According to military expert Stuart Hallifax - who has researched the brothers - Mrs Hanscombe received a letter on behalf of King George V to thank her for the patriotic effort made by her family.

And she said in a newspaper interview in 1918: ‘I never believed they would all come back’

However, Mr Hallifax wrote on his Great War London blog: ‘Sadly, Sarah Ann Hanscombe did not live to see her son acting as a local VIP in unveiling the local war memorial. She died in early 1920.

‘All of her sons who had served in the war survived it though. Unfortunately, David - who appears to have been the only one to remain a soldier - was killed in action in Waziristan in May 1922 though.’
