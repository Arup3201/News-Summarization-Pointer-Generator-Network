Environmentally minded shoppers can toss their fishing rods in the air and jump for joy as Tesco reveals plans to supply sustainable fish.

Thanks to soaring demand, the supermarket giant is set to crank up their range of 'alternative varieties' by a third, from 40 to 60, and become the first major UK retailer to stock fresh cuttlefish and octopus.

The Catch of the Day scheme aims to take the pressure off non-sustainable fish, and particularly the 'big five': cod, plaice, haddock, salmon and prawns.

As part of their drive to encourage more people to eat sustainable fish, Tesco is stocking fresh cuttlefish

The 'big five' fish, comprising prawns, left, salmon, right, cod, plaice and haddock, makes up 75% of Britain's total fish consumption

Consumption of these breeds makes up 75 per cent of total fish consumption in the UK.

Under the scheme, Tesco will now offer the widest range of fish on UK high streets.

Among the new, sustainably caught seasonal lines being brought in are fresh cuttlefish, fresh octopus, Dover sole and fresh squid.

Other new lines that will be sold by the supermarket as they become available are wild turbot, black bream, Witch soles, brill, grey mullet and anchovies.

All of the new fish varieties will be caught in and around British coastal waters, particularly in the south west of England.

Fish counter staff at Tesco have 
undertaken a training course on the new varieties so that they can offer
customers preparation tips.

Tesco fish specialist Gary Hooper said: 'Through the Catch of the Day initiative we aim to offer customers far more choice than they've ever had before so that they can buy alternatives to the big five species – cod, plaice, salmon, haddock and prawns – and help take pressure off endangered species.

'Last year we launched a training programme for our fish counter staff in order to encourage and advise customers about trying new species of fish which has already proved a great success.

'We think that given more choice and encouragement such as preparation and cooking advice many shoppers will be ready to try something new.

'This move will also benefit British fishing fleets.'

Tesco’s campaign to encourage shoppers to try new fish varieties is already showing strong results.

Over the past year the supermarket has seen the huge year on year sales rises for fish caught from sustainable sources.

Sales of lemon sole fillets are up 400 per cent, dyed kippers are up 259 per cent, and bass fillets are up 150 per cent.
