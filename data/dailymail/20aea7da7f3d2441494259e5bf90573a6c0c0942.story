The New York Police Department is trying to track down a dapper thief who authorities say stole two necklaces worth $90,000 from Tiffany & Co.'s posh Fifth Avenue boutique.

According to the NYPD, the crook - dressed to the nines in a suit and tie, while swinging an umbrella in his hand - asked a clerk at the company's flagship store if he could have a look at two diamond necklaces about 3 p.m. on Friday.

The suspect then examined the two necklaces after the clerk put them on top of the counter so he could get a better look.

The thief is then seen casually leaning on the counter as he continues to examine the pricey lavaliers - and that's when the clerk made a costly mistake.

As the crook is looking at the two necklaces, he turns his back and briefly walks away - and that's when the thief took off with nearly $100,000 in diamonds.Â

This is just the latest in a string of high-end jewelery thefts in Manhattan this year.

According to a New York Post report, on May 1, a couple managed to lift a $177,000 watch from the Porsche Design store.

That same couple ripped off two other pricey watches from the Bulgari store on Fifth Avenue on April 4.

Also in April, police arrested 29-year-old Tony Tacneau for an alleged watch-stealing crime spree that went on for nearly two months - Tacneau is accused of ripping off two different Tourneau shops, and a Cartier boutique between February 23 and March 12.

Additionally, another pricey watch was stolen from a Tourneau store on March 30, but police have been unable to link that theft to Tacneau.

The suspect in Friday's necklace heist remains at large.
