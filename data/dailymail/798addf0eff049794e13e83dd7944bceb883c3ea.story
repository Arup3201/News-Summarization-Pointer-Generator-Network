The parents of two schoolboys who killed themselves 15 months apart have criticised the school they attended for their muted response over the suicides.

The two boys hanged themselves after their personalities changed, they began dressing in black and listening to music with 'dark', depressing lyrics, it has been claimed.

Truman Edley, 15, hanged himself in his home, in Rotherham, and just over a year later Oliver King, 16, was found dead in similar circumstances.

Two months after that a 14-year-old attempted to hang himself but failed. All three were students at Wickersley School and Sports College, in Wickersley, near Rotherham.

The parents of a fourth youngster, also thought to be a member of the 'friendship group', were alerted when he was overheard by friends talking about suicide.

Police and medical experts in the town have investigated but say there is no criminal link between the three incidents and now the school has regular visits from a mental health counsellor available to speak to youngsters.

Truman was found dead at his home in November 2011 and Rotherham coroner Fred Curtis recorded a suicide verdict last year.

Last week the same coroner recorded the same verdict at an inquest into Oliver’s death in February last year.

Oliver’s mother Diane King contacted Truman’s mother Nicola Edley on Facebook when the parallels between the two deaths - less than a mile apart - became apparent.

The parents of both boys want to remove the stigma around discussing the issue of suicide.They have also criticised Wickersley School over their muted response.

Oliver's father Adrian King, 44, said: 'You might think that because you’ve protected your children and kept them away from what you consider to be the dangers, they won't be affected by things like this.

'It’s difficult to give advice, but if anything I would say act sooner and talk about the topic.'

Mrs Edley said: 'You send yourself crazy wondering about what’s normal because suicide is a taboo subject. It’s not something people speak about.

'I had nothing from the school other than a letter, just a couple of lines saying sorry to hear what had happened.

'Later, I emailed asking what measures had been put in place with regards to suicide and got no reply. They told students not to talk about it and it felt like they covered it up instead of using it to raise awareness.'

Changes to both Oliver and Truman saw them lose weight, wear black clothing and start listening to ‘dark’ music.

But the parents say that blaming bands with depressing lyrics in their songs is too easy and glosses over the real issues.

Mrs Edley said: 'Focusing on the music covers up the underlying factors. It’s used like a scapegoat rather than looking at why they are listening to that sort of music.'

Mr King added: 'I see music as effect rather than the cause. If you feel down you might put on a "down" song. If that’s all you’re listening to then I think it can have detrimental effect over time.

'It feels wrong to be drawing the conclusions that we are. You think these things only happen in cults or to those involved in the darkest recesses of society.

'All of us have learned the hardest way possible that these things, and these people, are much closer to home than we ever realised.'

Dr John Radford, director of Rotherham Public Health said: 'We have responded in relation to the incidents in Wickersley.

'It has heightened our awareness of teen suicides and the importance of mental health and well being.'

A spokeswoman for South Yorkshire Police said: 'An investigation was launched into the deaths of two young people from Flanderwell and Wickersley and the apparent attempted suicide of another person, all from the same friendship group.

'The investigation considered whether there was any link between the three incidents but concluded there was no criminal link.

'We have been working closely with its partners to provide support to the families and friends of those involved.'

The school has increased the number of days a week when a mental health charity worker is available to pupils from two to five.

Head
 teacher David Hudson has earlier said: 'We express our sincere 
condolences to the families of the young people affected, during what 
has been a tragic and very difficult time.'

Rotherham
 Council chief executive Martin Kimber added: 'We are all working 
together to develop an approach which supports the whole community to 
identify young people at risk of suicide and self harm.'

Last week an inquest into Oliver’s death heard that the schoolboy was happy, gifted at art and enjoyed outdoor activities. He had a good relationship with his parents and younger brother until about eight months before his death.

Family and friends say he became introverted, lost weight and wore dark clothing.

His mother Mrs King, who separated from Oliver’s dad seven years ago, said she felt like they were being pushed away by Oliver.

She told the inquest: 'I tried to talk to Oliver but got very little back. It upset me that he wouldn’t talk about anything. He was very secretive and pushed boundaries by not being home on time.'

She found him hanged when she returned to the house in Flanderwell, Rotherham.

His parents had become concerned about his progress in the sixth from at school and the amount of time he spent with his girlfriend, now aged 18.

Mr King said: 'Oliver’s clothing had become darker. From that time onwards he was always in black it came after the change in friendship group.

'I had known that he’d been finding it difficult, pretty much from the start. We met with one of the teachers and felt their was some hope and he might be able to recover the situation.'

Several of his friends spoke to police during an investigation into the death and one told them she thought Oliver was ‘trapped’.

Det Con Ian Hampshire told the inquest in Rotherham: 'She felt he showed glimpses of paranoia and was emotionally unstable.'

Weeks before his death Oliver sent a text to another friend saying: 'Screw it. I’m on the edge of killing myself every day.'

Oliver’s girlfriend, who asked not to be named, denied seeing much change in him after they met in the summer of 2012.

She said: 'Sometimes he got a bit paranoid that I was going to break up with him. Sometimes he got that into his head.

'He always said he never felt comfortable at home. The main unhappiness and stress he displayed was about school and the sheer workload of starting A-levels.'

Asked about his music taste she said: 'I don’t see it as dark music, I just see it as music.'

Patrick Butterell, who was head of sixth form at the time, said: 'He was very quiet, well behaved but didn’t do homework. He wasn’t always very responsive in class.'

Rotherham coroner Fred Curtis recorded a suicide verdict and said: 'He had been through some dark periods.That evening it culminated in a decision to take his own life. He was trapped with no one to turn to for objective advice.

'He was putting himself under pressure with his girlfriend who was perhaps not best equipped to recognise his problems and still less deal with them.'

An inquest a year ago heard that GCSE student Truman was a ‘happy bubbly joker’.

A few weeks before his death his mother noticed scratch marks on his arm and two friends said there had been evidence of self harm and advised him to seek help.
