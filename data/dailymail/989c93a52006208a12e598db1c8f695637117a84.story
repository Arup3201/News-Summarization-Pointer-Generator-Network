A former finance chief and head of department at one of the Government's first free schools have been charged with fraud. 

Staff at Kings Science Academy in Bradford, West Yorkshire, were arrested on suspicion of fraud offences such as abusing their positions and false accounting last year. 

The school's founder, Sajid Raza, who gave David Cameron a guided tour of the academy after setting it up in 2011, was charged with a range of offences including fraud by false representation last week. 

Three staff members at Kings Science Academy in Bradford, West Yorkshire, have been charged with fraud offences. Among them is the school's founder Sajid Raza pictured giving David Cameron a tour of the school in 2012

Today the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) confirmed Daud Khan, the school's former director of finance, and Shabana Hussain, a former head of department, would also face charges. 

All three will appear before Leeds Magistrates Court at a date yet to be fixed.  

Their arrests came after an investigation by the Education Funding Agency which found that more than £86,000 of funds given to the school had 'not been used for its intended purpose'. 

Claims included reimbursements for First Class plane tickets, furniture and parties, the report found. 

'Having carefully considered all of the evidence presented to us, we have concluded that there is sufficient evidence to charge Daud Khan (former director of finance) and Shabana Hussain (former head of department) with a range of offences relating to their involvement with the Kings Science Academy, Bradford, and that it is in the public interest to do so,' Julian Briggs, from CPS Yorkshire and Humberside, said.

'Accordingly, I have today authorised West Yorkshire Police to charge Daud Khan with two offences of fraud by abuse of position and three of false accounting, and Shabana Hussain with one offence of fraud by abuse of position and one offence of acquiring criminal property.  

An Education Funding Agency investigation claimed the school spent more than £86,000 of taxpayers' money on items that were not 'the intended use'

Following Raza's arrest in 2014 the Liberal Democrat MP for Bradford East, David Ward, put pressure on the then Education Secretary Michael Gove to address the fact taxpayers' money had been poured into the allegedly corrupt school. 

He declined to speak about the matter in the House of Commons, telling politicians he did not want to influence any police activity.  

Kings Science Academy was among the first free schools to be set up by the coalition in 2011. 

A year after its completion the Prime Minister visited the site to speak with pupils. He was photographed being shown around the grounds by Raza, 41. 

Last week he was charged with three offences of fraud by abuse of position, three offences of false accounting, two offences of obtaining a money transfer by deception, and one offence of fraud by false representation.
