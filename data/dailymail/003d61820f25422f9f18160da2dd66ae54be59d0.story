Sweden may have lost to Portugal in their World Cup play-off in November, but that hasn't stopped star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic travelling to Brazil.

The Paris Saint-Germain forward was pictured arriving in Rio and posing with the tournament's official mascot Fuleco the Armadillo.

It is not yet known whether Ibrahimovic has travelled to South America as a fan or for commercial reasons, although he will have no shortage of team-mates to watch if he decides to take in some live action.
