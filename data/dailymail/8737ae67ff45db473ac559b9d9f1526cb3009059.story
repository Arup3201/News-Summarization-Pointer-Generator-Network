Meeting: Chelsea's billionaire owner Roman Abramovich

Billionaire Chelsea soccer owner Roman Abramovich has held high-level talks about moving the Premier League club to Battersea.

He had a meeting earlier this year with financial backers of the debt-laden Battersea Power station about taking control of the site.

Mr Abramovich, said to be worth £7.2 billion, met the lenders to explore the opportunities of a shopping complex next to a new stadium at the iconic power station, it is believed.

Among the projects discussed was an aerial cable car system similar to the
one planned in east London, which would be used to bring tens of 
thousands of fans from west London to its new home 
south of the river.

The lenders are led by Ireland’s 
government-owned National Asset Management Agency (Nama), which manages a
£60 billion property portfolio as a result of the country’s banking 
crisis.

Owners Real Estate Opportunities (REO), are reportedly close to announcing a deal with an overseas investor who could buy the debt connected to the £500m site.

But Nama and Lloyds Banking Group, the 
other main lender, have to approve any new investor because 
the £300 million loan matured on August 31 without being repaid
by REO.

Chelsea football club's new home? The iconic Battersea power station

It is understood they prefer the Russian oligarch's plans because his wealth would bring 
financial stability and a new use for the historic site.

A Chelsea spokesman told the Sunday Telegraph: “We have talked to various people with interests in Battersea Power Station, but we haven’t had any substantive discussions with anyone with regards to that particular site for several months.”

Club chiefs are believed to be have concerns about the challenges of converting the site.

There is planning approval for 3,400 homes, 10 million sq ft of offices and retail space at the landmark site which has lain dormant since 1983 when the power station was shut.

REO director Rob Tincknell, said Chelsea FC did not fit on the power station site and claimed the demolition of the Grade II-listed building  would lead to a 10-year planning battle.

Currently Stamford Bridge, the club’s home for 106 years, holds 42,000 fans, some 34,000 fewer than Premier League rivals Manchester United.

Chelsea has looked at a number of locations across west London for a new home, including Earls Court and White City.

But any move will depend on the backing of the supporters group Chelsea Pitch Owners which owns the freehold to Stamford Bridge and naming rights to the football club.
