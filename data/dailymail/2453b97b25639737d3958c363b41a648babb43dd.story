The firebrand Islamic preacher Mohammed Junaid Thorne said he has received death threats.

It comes after reports Numan Haider, 18, who was shot dead after he allegedly stabbed two police officers on Tuesday night, is believed to have attended some of the cleric's lectures.   

Police believe Haider's failed murder plot was in response to a murderous call out by the Islamic State who, just hours before, urged its followers to kill Australians 'in any manner', The Australian reports.

The teenage terror suspect shot dead by police in Melbourne is believed to have attended lectures led by firebrand Islamic preacher Mohammed Junaid Thorne 

The 18-year-old, who was once a member of radical Melbourne-based Muslim group, Al-Furqan, that was the target of police terrorism raids back in 2012, is understood to have radicalised within a matter of weeks.

He is said to have attended lectures at the Al-Furqan Islamic Centre in Springvale by radical Perth -born preacher Mohammed Junaid Thorne earlier this year.

Thorne, who was filmed in front of an Islamic State flag urging people like Haider to show their 'might' against non-followers, took aim at police in a fiery Facebook statement on Wednesday night. 

'He was murdered in cold blood, right in front of a police station, in front of a place that is supposed to be providing security and comfort to our youth,' Thorne told his social media followers. 

'This boy was a normal good practicing (sic) young Muslim youth, with great character and kind moral.

'He was an average normal youth who spent his time hanging out with his friends, attending local mosques, and doing what every other youth does. 

'Allah please accept him as a Shaheed (martyr) and have mercy on him.' 

The extremist's rants, which often include controversial comments about Australia, have attracted support from high school teens and university students online across the country. 

On Thursday, Thorne said he was 'on the way to police station to report death threats from Australians in Australia.'

'It would be very interesting to see how they respond.' 

Thorne, whose brother was jailed for terrorism related offences in Saudi Arabia, also yesterday accused police of cancelling Haider's passport for no reason and claimed authorities raided the teenager's home in Narre Warren without a warrant before he was shot.

Before his death, Haider's Facebook page contained posts not dissimilar to Thorne.

He posted a photo of himself on Facebook in military attire holding an Islamic State flag saying: 'Let's not put the focus on other things. The main message I'm sending with these statuses and photos is to the dogs of the Australian Federal Police and ASIO who are declaring war on Islam and Muslims'.

Thorne, who has reportedly claimed to have memorised the Koran by age six, has recently made a number of controversial statements about Australia. 

Last Thursday, he issued a statement labelling the Australian government 'the real terrorists', following the largest ever counter-terrorism raids in the nation's history.

He said the Australian government wants to 'destroy Islam by any means... closing down Islamic centres, raiding Muslim houses, arresting active Muslim youth and preachers, intimidating Muslims cancelling their passports... and creating a vibe of fear within the Australian community to make them afraid of Muslims'. 

In August, he posted to Facebook saying scholars who support the Islamic State terror group are 'on the front lines, in the battlefields, backing their words with actions'. 

He told Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday it was a 'time of grief for us Muslims' following the shooting death of Haider in Melbourne.

Thorne's Facebook page contains controversial posts, including claims police murdered Haider in 'cold blood'. The posts are being liked and shared by Australian high school and university students  

His comments came as moderate Muslim leader Dr Jamal Rifi warned that the country must allow the authorities time to finish their investigations into the Tuesday night's stabbing. 

Justice Minister Michael Keenan praised the officers' 'bravery' and 'dedication' in a press conference on Wednesday morning. 

Mr Keenan said the police appeared to have acted in self-defence against a 'known terror suspect'.

'This incident occurred during a police investigation and it appears that the shooting by the police officer was in self-defence.' 

Victorian Premier Denis Napthine praised the officers.

He said any death is 'tragic', irrespective of the circumstances, and that his thoughts were with the family of the deceased

Prime Minister Tony Abbott described the attack  as 'fierce'. 

In a video statement, Mr Abbott said: 'Obviously this indicates there are people in our community who are capable of very extreme acts.' 

The Islamic Council of Victoria has called for a 'full and objective investigation' into how the incident came about so 'such a tragedy is never repeated'. 

Ghaith Krayem, the organisation's Secretary, said in a statement the organisation felt 'deep sorrow' about 'last night's tragic events'.  

'Events that, on face value, should not have cost a young man his life and put two police officers in hospital.

'Our focus, at this time, is on supporting the family of the young man; ensuring that their needs are catered for.'

Mr Krayem said the incident showed the 'real cost of a failure to deal with these serious issues which is why we have made numerous calls on the Australian government to deal with the root causes of alienation and disaffection of people such as this.'    

He said no one should try to 'inflame' the situation and 'everyone should be calling for calm'.
