A drug-crazed thug who battered a nursery nurse so badly her own mother failed to recognise her because of her blood-soaked hair has been jailed for 12 years.

Katey Wall was forced to play dead after Matthew Atkins punched the back of her head repeatedly after he pounced as she walked home in Bridgnorth, Shropshire.

Her injuries were so bad her mother did not recognise her when she met her daughter's ambulance as it reached hospital, especially because the blood had stained her blonde locks a shocking red.

The 25-year-old punched her repeatedly for 10 minutes and only stopped beating Miss Wall, 24, after a member of the public walked past in the early hours of July 30 last year.

Now and then: Katey Wall, left, was so badly beaten that her usual blonde hair was left bright red because she lost so much blood from her head in the attack, right

There was so much blood at the scene that when paramedics arrived they initially believed she had been stabbed.

The judge said in court that if it had not been Miss Wall who was attacked he would have assaulted another woman that night.

'I wasn’t aware anyone was following me,' she said.

'I heard a couple of footsteps and someone put their hand over my mouth from behind. When I turned around I realised I didn’t know him and he kept his hand over my mouth and was pinching my nose.

'It was a struggle at first, I was throwing my arms everywhere and screaming but he had his hand over my mouth.

'I was face down and he was using my hair to bash my head on the floor really hard. I thought that was it, I thought I was going to die.

'So I thought maybe if I do play dead and stop breathing, he might go away. He was listening for my breathing and eventually I let out a gasp, then he kept on banging my head off the floor.

'I’m just relieved it’s over. It was never going to be enough no matter what he got.

'I’ll just go home and try to get back to normal now.'

She was rushed to Princess Royal Hospital in Telford, where she had nine stitches to wounds in the back of her head.

'My hair was exactly the same colour as it is now (blonde). There was a lot of blood,' she said.

'When they opened the ambulance doors my own mum didn’t even recognise me. My hair was completely red.

'I’ve had really bad nightmares and I won’t go out in the dark on my own anymore. It’s changed my life in that way.'

Atkins was jailed for 12 years at Shrewsbury Crown Court after he admitted unlawfully and maliciously wounding with intent to cause her grievous bodily harm.

The court heard he had snorted at least three grams of cocaine and downed booze before launching the unprovoked attack.

Atkins was told he would serve at least nine years before being released.

Jailing him Judge Robin Onions said: 'She was a lady and she was a vulnerable victim. It must have been a terrifying incident.

'This was a horrific offence. You went out on the night in question and chose to take with you two grams of cocaine.

'During the course of that evening you had taken probably over three grams of cocaine. You were effectively out of control such that you had no control over your behaviour.

'She was a lady and she was a vulnerable victim. It must have been a terrifying incident,' Judge Robin Onions, pictured, said in court

'I can only presume this was a targeted attack. Not that you targeted Miss Wall, but that you targeted a girl.'

The court heard Atkins targeted her as she walked home in the early hours after a night out with friends in Bridgnorth, Shropshire.

Phillip Beardwell, prosecuting, told the court Atkins left Katey in a pool of blood before ditching his blood-stained pink jumper and trainers in a car park.

He then made his way across Bridgnorth and broke into a detached garage at someone’s home where he stole a pair of golf shoes and a high visibility jacket.

He was arrested by police at his home the next day after fingerprints found at the garage matched his own.

Mr Beardwell said: 'Mr Atkins had by all accounts consumed a large amount of drugs and alcohol that evening.

'It was a random, isolated attack. She (Miss Wall) thought she was going to die.

'The bleeding caused her hair to effectively change colour to an almost red because of the amount of blood that had seeped through.'

The court heard Atkins claimed he launched a frenzied attack on Katey Wall after snorting a bad batch of cocaine.

Jonathan Challinor, defending, said: ‘Matthew Atkins took with him to the social club two grams of cocaine and he consumed it.

‘Coupled with the consumption of cocaine was the consumption of a very large amount of alcohol.

‘One of the theories for his conduct and behaviour is the cocaine, which he got from a stranger.

‘One can hazard a guess that it caused this defendant to behave in a way that he had never behaved when taking cocaine previously.

‘What he did has no obvious explanation whatsoever. The bizarre behaviour occurred afterwards as well. The next recollection of Matthew Atkins is waking up in a farmers field some way away.’

Mr Challinor went on to describe Atkins behaviour as ‘utterly out of character and totally inexplicable’ - saying he had a strong network of family and friends who trusted him with their children.

He added: ‘He’s a young man who is prepared to change and change for the better.

'He has made it plain his absolute disgust at his own conduct that evening.

'Everyone who knows this defendant simply can’t believe he as committed an offence of this nature.'
