The ongoing spat over national security spending between Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie reached a fever pitch on Tuesday, with Paul referring to the plus-sized Christie as 'the king of bacon.'

'This is the king of bacon talking about bacon,' Paul told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Both are considered potential 2016 contenders for the Republican presidential nomination.

Paul's remark was in response to Christie's comments earlier in the day that Paul brings millions in 'pork' spending back to his home state of Kentucky.

How Rude! Senator Rand Paul called Chris Christie - the plus-sized governor of New Jersey - 'the king of bacon'

'So if Senator Paul wants to start looking at where he's going to cut 
spending to afford defense, maybe he should start cutting the pork 
barrel spending that he brings home to Kentucky,' Christie told reporters

Christie last week criticized Paul’s opposition to warrantless federal surveillance programs, saying it harmed efforts to prevent terrorism. Paul told reporters after speaking at a fundraiser outside Nashville on Sunday that Christie’s position hurts GOP chances in national elections, and that spending priorities of critics like the governor and Rep. Peter King of New York do more to harm national security.

'They’re precisely the same people who are unwilling to cut the spending, and their "Gimme, gimme, gimme — give me all my Sandy money now.’” Paul said, referring to federal funding after the hurricane last year. 'Those are the people who are bankrupting the government and not letting enough money be left over for national defense.'

The king: Christie has been struggling with his weight for years and recently underwent gastric band surgery

King in a phone interview late Sunday called Paul’s criticism of Sandy aid 'indefensible.'

'This was absolutely life or death money that was essential to New York and New Jersey,' King said.

Christie, at a forum in Colorado on Thursday, pointed to a 'strain of libertarianism' coursing through both parties as a 'very dangerous thought' more than a decade after the Sept. 11 attacks. Christie was asked whether he was referring to Paul, a fellow potential Republican presidential candidate who has been at the forefront of the party’s libertarian wing.

'You can name any number of people and he’s one of them,' said Christie. 'These esoteric, intellectual debates — I want them to come to New Jersey and sit across from the widows and the orphans and have that conversation. And they won’t, because that’s a much tougher conversation to have.'

War of words: Christie and Paul have been feuding for weeks about Paul's libertarian leanings

Paul on Sunday rejected arguments that the National Security Agency’s collection of hundreds of millions of U.S. phone and Internet records is necessary to prevent terrorism.

'I don’t mind spying on terrorists,' he said. 'I just don’t like spying on all Americans.'

Paul said the issue resonates particularly with young people, a key demographic Republicans need to attract in order to succeed in national elections.

'If you talk about some privacy issues like that, I think you will find youth coming to you,' said Paul, who said his own decision on whether to run for president won’t come until next year.

King called that argument misguided.

'When it comes to national defense, we shouldn’t be pandering to any demographic,' he said. 'We need to do what’s best for the country.'

Messages left with Christie’s office late Sunday were not immediately returned.

As for the back and forth with Christie, Paul said he wasn’t the one itching for a fight.

'I didn’t start this one, and I don’t plan on starting things by criticizing other Republicans,' he said. 'But if they want to make me the target, they will get it back in spades.'
