Spared jail: Clairvoyant Christina Green, 56, was given a suspended prison sentence after being found guilty of five counts of fraud

A clairvoyant who failed to foresee that she would get caught cheating the taxpayer out of more than £100,000 in benefits has escaped a prison sentence despite being found guilty of fraud.

Self-declared 'spiritual medium' Christina Green, 56, failed to declare that she owned two houses in Herne Bay, Kent, dodging thousands of pounds of council tax.

At the same time Green, who travels the country giving spiritual readings in churches and theatres, and promoting her book, claimed income support, jobseekers' allowance, and housing and council tax benefit.

She conned a total of £114,000 in benefits and was only caught when she applied for more benefits and officials from Canterbury City Council and the Department for Work and Pensions investigated her.

The psychic told Maidstone Crown Court the second house belonged to her ex-husband and denied five counts of fraud, but a jury still convicted her of five counts.

Today Judge Jeremy Carey let the mother-of-three walk free, sentencing her to 12 months in jail suspended for 18 months.

The judge said: 'This sentence I have imposed should not be construed as some kind of charter for any offender, male or female, that no-one goes to prison even though they defraud the state in relation to substantial sums of money.

'Each case must be determined on its own facts and courts do not sentence by rote but by the particular circumstances of each case.'

Judge Carey said that Green would have been entitled to some benefits over that time, so the sentencing had to be in proportion.  And he said it would impose a further burden on the taxpayer if he sent her to prison.

The judge said the impact on her children and her own 'precarious' mental state had been taken into account.

Hannah Eales, prosecuting, told the court: 'It is the Crown’s case that when she completed a form and was asked about her circumstances she declared she was a lady with three children and had no savings, investments or capital, including property.'

Spiritual: The clairvoyant's website describes her as 'one of Britain's most exciting spiritual mediums'

As part of her sentence Green must carry out 150 hours of unpaid work and attend a women’s programme activity.

Confiscation proceedings are to be held at a later date.

A spokeswoman for Canterbury City 
Council, who were defrauded out of housing and council tax benefit 
money, said: 'We obviously frown upon any kind of fraud against the 
council.'
