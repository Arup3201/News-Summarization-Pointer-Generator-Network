Content: Sue Bramley insists she's happy at her home, despite it being the scene of a murder

A mother 
whose back garden once contained the bodies of a murdered couple has 
spoken of her profound shock at the discovery of their remains, saying 
that she 'went to pieces'.

Sue
 Bramley and her 15-year-old daughter live at a property in Mansfield 
where Susan and Christopher Edwards shot and killed William and Patricia
 Wycherley – Susan’s parents – in 1998 and buried the bodies under the 
lawn.

They remained a macabre secret until 2013, with Ms Bramley a resident since 2006.

Ms Bramley described how she was horrified when Nottinghamshire detectives phoned her at work in October last year and told her about their grim discovery - of remains buried three feet beneath her lawn.

She said: ‘It was terrible. I went to pieces. I came home and all these people arrived in white suits. I've lost track of what happened, I was so emotional.’

But although the unearthing of the remains proved a huge shock to Ms Bramley, she insists she’ll be perfectly happy to stay at the house. 

She told the BBC: ‘A lot of people have said, “How can you possibly still live there?”’

‘But I love our home. We have got a great garden and we have had a lot of happy times here.

‘I have lived here all this time and the Wycherleys have not done me any harm. They are not going to do my any harm now. I am going to stay.’

Ms Bramley said she ‘never really thought anything’ of the area in her garden where grass would not grow, where it would later emerge the Wycherleys had been buried.

‘We used to have birthday parties in the garden, which my young nieces and nephews used to come to and they used to dig in that area.

My nephew would bury his cars and my niece would have to dig to find them and I just think, “how close, how close”.’

Ms Bramley spoke out as the Edwards, who successfully hid their crime for 16 years, were sentenced to life in prison for the murders and unlawful burials of William, 85 and 63-year-old Patricia.

For years, Susan, 56, and Christopher, 57, kept claiming the Wycherleys' benefits, stealing £245,000 from them, and conning friends and relatives that they were still alive.

The Edwards, who were found guilty of murder last week, have to serve a minimum of 25 years behind bars, a judge at Nottingham Crown Court ruled.

Sentencing the pair, Mrs Justice Kathryn Thirlwall said the Edwards had created ‘an elaborate charade’ which ran for 15 years to deceive family and neighbours as to what had happened to the Wycherleys.

Grisly: Sue Bramley and her daughter live at a property in Mansfield where Susan and Christopher Edwards shot and killed William and Patricia Wycherley – Susan’s parents – in 1998

Shocking: Ms Bramley said that she went to pieces when the bodies of William and Patricia Wycherley were dug up at the house she rents in 2013

She said the facts of the case were ‘so serious and your culpability so high’ that she had no choice but impose minimum terms of 25 years each, for each of the two murders, to run concurrently.

The court heard that the debt-ridden couple shot their victims at their home in Mansfield on the May bank holiday, with the couple then buried in a metre-deep hole in their own back garden.

For the next 15 years, the couple kept up the elaborate hoax that Mr Wycherley, 85, and his 63-year-old wife were alive.

The debt-ridden pair made it appear as though the ‘reclusive’ Wycherleys were still alive and had simply moved away, faking their signatures on official documents, and sending Christmas cards and letters apparently from them to family members.

As a result, they were able to rake in almost £250,000 in pensions, credit, and the sale of the Wycherley’s home - much of which celebrity-obsessed Susan, who also felt her parents had ‘swindled’ her out of a £10,000 inheritance in the 1970s, spent on correspondence signed by her favourite stars.

The 56-year-old was fixated with powerful older men - including Hollywood actors Gerard Depardieu and Gary Cooper, legendary football manager Bill Shankly, entertainer Frank Sinatra, and political giants Winston Churchill and General Charles De Gaulle.

Their elaborate plot did not begin to unravel until 2012 when the Centenarian Department of the Department of Work and Pensions wrote to Mr Wycherley, who would have been approaching his 100th birthday, and asked for a face-to-face meeting.

The Edwards panicked and fled their council home in Dagenham, East London, to Lille in northern France, renting a flat which they paid for in cash.

Christopher Edwards, who could speak fluent French, attempted to find work but was unsuccessful.

Revelations: The judge accepted accusations from Mrs Edwards that her father, William Wycherley (pictured) had abused her

By October last year, they were fast running out of cash. In desperation, Christopher, 57, called his stepmother, Elizabeth Edwards, back in the UK to ask for money – then told her the stunning revelation that the Wycherleys were buried in their garden.

He also gave her the version of events that Elizabeth Edwards should stick to during their police interviews and trial - but she called the police as soon as the conversation finished.

Stunned detectives then made the grim discovery of the Wycherley’s remains and contacted Christopher Edwards using phone numbers and an email address he had given his stepmother.

He eventually replied and arranged to return to the UK, and the couple were arrested at St Pancras International railway station a month after the Wycherleys were unearthed.

The only possessions the Edwards, who had just one Euro left to their name, brought back was a suitcase full of celebrity memorabilia.

Included were five items of correspondence signed by the 1950s film star Gary Cooper, which Susan had splashed out more than £14,000 on during 2009 and 2011.

It was a sign of Susan’s obsession with celebrities, a fascination which the court heard even extended to writing hundreds letters to herself posing as the French actor Gerard Depardieu.

The fake 14-year correspondence, between 1992 and 2006, even deceived her own husband, with Susan acquiring a machine to make it seem as though the letters had a French postmark.

Despite stealing hundreds of thousands of pounds owed to the Wycherleys, including selling their home complete with its macabre secret for £66,000 in 2005, the Edwards remain deep in debt, owing around £160,000 to creditors.

Sentencing the couple on Monday, Mrs Justice Thirlwall described the killings as ‘shocking crimes’.

She told the ‘self-contained couple’ that so far as they were concerned ‘only the two of you mattered’.

The judge told Susan Edwards, who sat staring intently from the dock wearing a patterned grey cardigan and glasses, that she was ‘an accomplished liar and a fantasist’.

Mrs Justice Thirlwall accepted ‘on balance’ that she had told the truth about being sexually abused by Mr Wycherley as a child and that had formed the basis of the hatred she felt for her father.

‘That background may explain why you hated him, which you did, and why you have no remorse about killing him,’ she said.

The judge said she did not believe Mrs Wycherley had ever known of that abuse, as had been claimed in court as being the motive for killing her.
