Nicolas Sarkozy is said to be in a 'state of incomprehension' today after being accused of accepting cash-stuffed envelopes from the richest woman in the world.

The former French president has been charged with taking financial advantage of frail l'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt, 90.

With his political career in ruins, Mr Sarkozy now faces a criminal trial and the possibility of going to prison.

As his legal team was preparing to 
appeal against the decision, political allies made it clear that he was 
shell shocked as he returned from Bordeaux - where he was charged - to 
the Paris home he shares with his third wife, former supermodel Carla 
Bruni.

'As you can imagine he is in a state 
of incomprehension,' said Jean-Francois Cope, president of Mr Sarkozy's 
conservative UMP party.

Francois Fillon, Mr Sarkozy's former 
prime minister, went on to Twitter to say the decision was 'unfair' and 
said 'the truth will triumph'.

Mr Sarkozy's lawyer Thierry Herzog 
also attacked the indictment as 'legally incoherent and unfair' saying 
his client was being treated 'scandalously.'

Mr Sarkzoy was unexpectedly summoned on Thursday to the Bordeaux offices of Jean-Michel Gentil, the judge in charge of the case.

There he met at least four former 
members of Bettencourt's staff, who said Mr Sarkozy regularly turned up 
at the Bettencourt mansion in Paris to accept cash to help fund his 2007
election campaign.

Mrs Bettencourt's doctors say her 
mental capacity began to deteriorate from the autumn of 2006, meaning 
she would have been particularly vulnerable to people asking her for 
money.

The principal allegation is that Mr 
Sarkozy obtained up to 4 million euros from her, breaching electoral 
spending limits and taking advantage of a person weakened by ill health.

Jean-Michel Gentil, the judge in 
charge, hoped to establish today how many times Mr Sarkozy actually 
visited Mrs Bettencourt’s luxury Paris home in the months before he was 
elected.

Mr Sarkozy insists that it was only once, despite many former Bettencourt staff members saying he was always popping round.

The
principal allegation against Mr Sarkozy is that he took advantage of 
the frail state of the aged widow to take money from her.

Claire Thibout, Mrs Bettencourt’s 
former accountant, told police in 2010 that she had handed cash-filled 
envelopes to Bettencourt's financial manager, Patrice de Maistre, who 
subsequently passed them on to Mr Sarkozy's campaign treasurer, Eric 
Woerth.

Mr Sarkozy is also said to have collected money in person.

While Mr Sarkozy was being charged with the offences in Bordeaux, his wife Carla Bruni was in Berlin where she was performing at the Echo music awards.

She is about to make a return to modelling starring in a campaign for Italian fashion house Bulgari. Top fashion photographer Terry Richardson reportedly photographed Bruni in Rome for the campaign this week.

Ms Bruni has also recently completed a new album called Little French Songs in which she allegedly mocks current French Prime Minister Francois Hollande by referring to him as a penguin.

Mr Sarkozy lost his immunity from 
prosecution when he lost the 2012 presidential election to his Socialist
rival Francois Hollande.

Within a few weeks, the home he shares with Ms Bruni was raided by anti-corruption police.

In 2011, Mr Sarkozy's predecessor, 
Jacque Chirac, was found guilty on corruption charges related to his 
time as mayor of Paris, and received a two-year suspended prison 
sentence.

Since losing to Mr Hollande, Mr 
Sarkozy had been trying to make money on the international conference 
circuit, but he also hinted that he might return to power in 2017.

But he faces numerous other 
corruption enquiries, including claims that he took cash from Colonel 
Gaddafi, the late Libyan dictator.

Despite all this, Sarkozy has 
regularly hinted that he may still make a bid to return to the Elysee 
Palace in 2017. This now looks an impossibility.

Mrs Bettencourt was recently listed as the richest woman in the world by Forbes magazine.
