A  couple's plans for a dream engagement on their luxury Mexican holiday were ruined - when the groom-to-be was hit by suspected salmonella poisoning.

Joe Kilgannon, 24, and his fiancee Cezanne Bannon, 22, are suing Thomas Cook after  their romantic getaway to the five-star Mexican hotel was cursed by chronic food poisoning.

The forklift truck driver fell ill just days into the break at the five-star Grand Bahia Principe in Riviera Maya - and had hospital treatment for salmonella poisoning back home in Britain.

Mr Kilgannon, from Newport, told how he 'spent more time popping to the toilet rather than popping the question', ruining the romantic holiday.

He said: 'Our trip to Mexico was meant to be a romantic break for us to celebrate our engagement together.

'But it was completely ruined after I became seriously ill.

'We were very disappointed with the standards at the hotel; especially at it was meant to be a five-star resort.'

The couple were very disappointed with the standards at the hotel, which is 'meant to be a five star resort' 

The couple paid more than £2,000 for the stay at the plush holiday resort, back in December 2014.

Mr Kilgannon said: 'Throughout our stay at the resort we noticed that some of the food was served only lukewarm and the burgers we were served in the restaurant were raw in the middle.

'But obviously we only spotted this after biting into them the first time.

'Nothing can turn back the clock and make amends for our ruined holiday but we hope that with the help of our legal team we will be able to find the answers we are seeking as to how I fell so seriously ill.'

A few days into the holiday Mr Kilgannon began to feel unwell and his condition rapidly deteriorated

The couple also claim that there were insects  all over their original hotel room, necessitating a room change.

Just a few days into the holiday Mr Kilgannon began to feel unwell in the middle of the night and his condition rapidly deteriorated.

The couple's lawyer said he is investigating 'the cause of Joseph's illness and how he came to contract salmonella' 

He was hospitalised in Britain and after further tests he was diagnosed with Salmonella poisoning.

The couple have instructed international personal injury experts to investigate the cause of the illness after Joseph began to suffer from abdominal cramps and diarrhoea.

Their lawyer Jennifer Downing, of specialist firm Irwin Mitchell, said: 'This was meant to be one of the most romantic breaks of Joseph and Cezanne's lives but unfortunately the illness he suffered left them unable to fully enjoy the facilities at the hotel and they went home with awful memories rather than happy ones.

'Salmonella is a potentially fatal form of food poisoning that can leave some sufferers with permanent symptoms.

'We will now be investigating the cause of Joseph's illness and how he came to contract salmonella. 

'We hope Thomas Cook the tour operator will co-operate fully with us during our investigations.

'We would ask anyone who has recently stayed at the resort to get in touch with us if they feel they are able to assist with our investigations.'

A Thomas Cook spokesperson confirmed they were investigating 'serious and, at present, unsubstantiated allegations' about the hotel stay.

She said: 'Thomas Cook would, of course, like to congratulate Mr Kilgannon and Ms Bannon on their engagement.

'Mr Kilgannon did not raise any concerns with our reps or the hotel management at the time.

'As it appears that his symptoms arose several days after his return to the UK, this would suggest that the illness was unconnected to his holiday in Mexico.

'Thomas Cook takes health and safety issues extremely seriously. We closely audit all the properties to which we operate to ensure that the very highest hygiene standards are maintained.'
