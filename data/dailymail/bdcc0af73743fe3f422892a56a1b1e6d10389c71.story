It was up against spectacular seascapes and even a portrait of a Hollywood actress.

But judges chose this 'honest' image of a bare-chested man displaying enormous calluses spreading across his shoulders as the winner of the world's longest-running photography exhibition.

Italian photographer Antonio Busiello's The Cullatore struck a chord in a world obsessed with 'retouched perfection', the panel said.

Acclaim: Italian photographer Antonio Busiello's 'honest' image of a bare-chested man displaying his enormous calluses struck a chord in a world 'obsessed with retouched perfection', judges said

The striking portrait secured Mr Busiello the gold award in the 156th Royal Photographic Society International Print Exhibition.

'Cullatori' is the name given to men who carry vast wooden structures through the narrow streets of Nola, in Southern Italy, every year as part of the annual Festival of the Lillies.

Since 410AD the 'cullatori' have been bearing the weight of the eight 82ft structures through the town for one day and one night to mark the religious festival.

It leaves the men with huge calluses across their backs, but far from hiding them away, they are proudly displayed as 'symbols of their sacrifice and devotion' to St Paulinus.

Chair of the selectors Ray Spence said the image raises 'valid and contemporary questions about body image'.
