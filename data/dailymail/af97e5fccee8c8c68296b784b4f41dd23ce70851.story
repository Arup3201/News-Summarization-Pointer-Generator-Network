Going on daily walks, wagging her tail and leaping about in the snow, this is the lamb who now thinks she is a sheep dog after being raised by Border Collies in the Scottish Highalnds.

Hilarious footage shows 10-month-old lamb Pet adopting a bizarre running style as she tries to keep up with the pack of sheep dogs on her owners croft farm in Ullapool in Ross-shire.

Pet was taken under the wing of the Collies when owner Mairi Mackenzie brought the young sheep into the croft house after she struggled to survive following her birth in April last year. 

Wagging her tail and leaping about in the snow, Pet the lamb thinks she is a sheep dog after being raised by Border Collie in the Scottish Highlands 

Pet cuddles up to one of the sheep dogs at the croft owned by Mairi McKenzie in Ullapool in Ross-shire 

She then instantly bonded with her fellow housemates and was 'adopted' by a sheep dog called Dice and even began sleeping in a dog basket.

Now she behaves more like a dog than a lamb and even tries to wag her tail and loves nothing more than going on daily walks with all of the dogs.

Ms McKenzie, 51, owner of the Ullapool B&B, said: 'She’s a right character.

'When she was born she wasn’t doing so well so we lifted her from her mother.

'She bonded with the dogs and they accepted her as one of them.

'She’s still a wee bit wobbly but loves to hop, skip and jump around.

Pet has adopted her own running style in order to keep up with the dogs 

Pet sleeps inside the croft house rather than outside in her own dog basket after struggling to survive when she was first born 

'When she was younger she even slept in the dogs best - she kicked one out of its own bed at one point.

'I’ve never seen anything like this before - it’s really unusual.'

Ms McKenzie's daughter Jemma also helps out on the croft and says Pet and the dogs have forged an unbreakable bond.

The 23-year-old added: 'When she was young she became so attached to the dogs - when she couldn't see them she would bleat for them.

Pet's owners say they will never get rid of her because she has forged an unbreakable bond with the other dogs 

'She became especially attached to the oldest dog and they would take themselves off for walks.

'Once we found them three miles away.

'She was so tame, she would even come and sit in Mum’s office while she worked.

'We’ve kept other lambs as pets before but they’ve never been like this.

'I don’t think we’ll ever get rid of her - the oldest dog would be gutted.'
