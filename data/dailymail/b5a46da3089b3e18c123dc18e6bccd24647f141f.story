A heartbroken sister has pleaded for a crackdown on 'legal highs' which she believes left her brother 'looking like a vampire' before his death this week.

Father-of-three Michael McKay, 33, from Arbroath, Angus, passed away at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee following a five-month addiction to new psychoactive substances (NPS), which caused him severe heart problems.

Laura McKay, 35, wants her brother’s case to highlight how people are being made vulnerable to 'dangerous' unregulated and untested substances - some of which are readily available over the counter.

Heartbreaking: Michael McKay, 33, from Arbroath (pictured left when he was 15 years old) died 'looking like a vampire' because of legal highs, his sister Laura believes

She spoke after figures revealed that deaths involving NPS in Scotland have more than doubled since last year.

Miss McKay, who has her own cleaning business, believes that people don’t understand the dangers associated with using these substances.

She said: 'Michael had his personal difficulties in the past. He was a heroin user but had managed to put that behind him.

'He started buying these new drugs from a shop in Arbroath and you could see immediately he was addicted.

'He started taking them in May this year and the physical change in him was frightening. He lost four stone in five months. He ended up looking like a vampire.

'I think I’m past being angry. But I want people to know how these drugs killed Michael, and make sure no one’s children or brothers have to go through what he did.' 

She added: 'A lot of people in Arbroath thought he was a kind, lovable man. He was just extremely lost.'

Doctors initially thought Mr McKay was suffering from pneumonia before discovering an infection around his heart valves.

Miss McKay said his condition had improved at the beginning of this week, following a course of antibiotics, and thought her brother had got over the worst of it. She last saw him the evening before he died.

She said: 'I left him at 8.45pm, gave him a cuddle and said I loved him loads. And that was it. 12.10am, he was gone.'

She has 
lauded the work of the police-led Tayside Intensive Support Service, 
which she described as a lifeline for herself and Michael.

She
 said: 'They saw Michael at his worst, saw him come on in leaps and 
bounds, and saw him deteriorate. They have been with us all the way.'

Decline: Miss McKay (pictured with her brother when he was seven years old) said he lost four stone in five months after he started buying the substances from a shop in Arbroath

The Reverend Martin Fair of St Andrews Church in Arbroath has been at the forefront of the campaign to try and close the town’s two shops selling ‘legal highs’.

He said: 'I have been working with young people in Arbroath with addiction problems. In the last 18 months since these so called legal highs have been available it has just been fuel to the fire.

'The death toll is rising and until the authorities have the legislation or the powers to stop the sale of these substances they will continue to rise. I just wish these shop owners who are dealing this stuff would develop a conscience.

'I have known Michael for some years and although he had his problems over the years he was a really nice young guy. Sadly it looks like I will be conducting his funeral now.'

Troubles: The father-of-three had a history of drug abuse and his sister believes he was 'extremely lost' 

Psychoactive substances are now openly available

The new psychoactive substances (NPS) have always been available in some form or another, with partygoers long using freely available substances like amyl nitrate and nitrous oxide to get a fix.

However, the recent explosion in legal high use came with the rise in popularity of a class of drugs known as cathinones, particularly mephedrone, from 2007 onwards.

The drug, which is chemically similar to compounds found in the khat plant of eastern Africa, became popular among clubbers as a more easily available - and legal - replacement for MDMA, the active ingredient in ecstasy tablets.

The effects of the substance have been likened to a combination of MDMA, amphetamine and cocaine. It is said to have the euphoric effects of ecstasy, but with the short-lived hit of a line of coke.

Mephedrone's popularity gave rise to a whole new market for legal highs sold over the internet and when the substance was finally banned in 2010 a range of other novel synthesised drugs had sprung up to take its place. Many of them were produced by laboratories in China and bought and imported by entrepreneurs using popular wholesale websites like Alibaba.com. However their purity was difficult to ascertain.

One legal drug which followed mephedrone in rising to popularity was 6-APB, known commonly as Benzo Fury. A molecule of the same phenethylamine class as MDMA, it marked a fresh attempt by enterprising chemists to circumvent drugs laws by slightly changing the chemical makeup of popular drugs.

Those attempts have now turned into a cat and mouse game with legislators, with chemists synthesising new substances faster them Parliament can ban them, spawning a whole industry to feed Britain's hunger for mind-altering substances.

However, unlike drugs which have been around for years and for which risks are generally well known, the long term - and indeed short term - risks many of these new substances are still a mystery.
