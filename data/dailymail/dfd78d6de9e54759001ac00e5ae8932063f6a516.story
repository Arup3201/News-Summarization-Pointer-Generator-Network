Pictured: The Duchess of Cambridge was photographed topless on holiday in France

Pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge sunbathing topless have now been seen by seven million Britons, research has found.

While only one per cent have seen the shots, taken with a super-long lens, in foreign magazines or a newspaper, one in five adults with internet access have seen them online.

And two thirds think the photographer who took the pictures should be prosecuted.

The French magazine Closer is being 
sued by the Royals after it was the first to publish the snaps of Kate 
sunbathing at the chateau in southern France.

Police probing the photographer who took the pictures have been questioning staff at the chateau where the couple were staying.

Nearly three quarters of the 1,600 
people polled by YouGov said Kate and husband William, both 30, were 
right to pursue legal action.

The survey revealed about 26 per cent of men have looked the pictures up online, compared to just 15 per cent of women.

And those aged between 18 and 24 have viewed them the most.

The editor of Closer has revealed she has complained to police after receiving hundreds of insulting e-mails.

Laurence Pieau, who has called 
criticism of her magazine 'stupid', has said she has received more than 
300 e-mails, and some death threats.

The couple have won a court order banning French magazine Closer from selling or republishing the pictures

Closer published 13 grainy images of Kate's breasts and bottom last Thursday, branded 'grotesque and unjustifiable' by a Royal spokesman.

Danish celebrity magazine Se og Hoer was the fifth publication to print photographs of Kate sunbathing topless as the images have now been seen by millions worldwide.

Police have been searching the place where the pictures were taken more than half a mile from the retreat.

It is thought they will also look for clues or DNA traces left behind.
