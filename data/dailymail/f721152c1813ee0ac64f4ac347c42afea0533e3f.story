Newcastle are continuing to watch Anderlecht's Aleksandar Mitrovic ahead of a proposed January bid. Club scouts previously watched the 20-year-old against Galatasaray in the Champions League. 

Although he failed to score in a 2-0 win, the Serbia international still had an impressive game. Mitrovic is valued at £15million and scored the equaliser for Anderlecht in their 3-3 draw with Arsenal last month. He has nine goals this season.

Alan Pardew wants someone to share the goal burden with Papiss Cisse and 6ft 3in Mitrovic is seen as a player who can also develop with good sell-on value.

The Magpies have been plagued with injuries in the first half of the Premier League season, and Pardew has had to rely on a number of fringe players to lead the team to victory.

Cisse scored twice at the weekend as Newcastle beat Chelsea 2-1. It was the Blues' first defeat of the season, and it took Pardew's side up to 7th in the league. 

Newcastle next face Arsenal at the Emirates.
