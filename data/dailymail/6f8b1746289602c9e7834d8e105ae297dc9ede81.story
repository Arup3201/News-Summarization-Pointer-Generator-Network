Max Chilton is to rekindle his partnership with Carlin ahead of a potential crack at IndyCar in 2016.

Chilton finds himself without a Formula One drive this year in the wake of Marussia's demise last season, unless ongoing rescue talks come to fruition.

For now Chilton has agreed to work with Surrey-based Carlin as they prepare for an initial crack at Indy Lights, a developmental series sanctioned by IndyCar, driving for three days of official testing at the Homestead circuit in Florida next week.

Max Chilton has agreed to work with Carlin, who he previously drove for in GP2 between 2011 and 2012

The 23-year-old has been without a job in Formula One after the folding of Marussia last season

The 23-year-old previously drove for Carlin in 2011 and 2012 in GP2, winning two races en route to finishing fourth in the championship in the latter year.

With Carlin aiming to run in IndyCar in 2016, there is a possibility they could turn to Chilton dependant on what transpires for him this year.

Chilton said: 'While I'm still considering my options for 2015, the IndyCar package presents an interesting challenge.

'By assisting with the development of the Indy Lights team I'm keeping my options open for an IndyCar programme in 2016 based on a strong foundation of knowledge and experience.

'Hopefully I can also help the guys at Carlin get as much as possible out of their first season in the USA.'

Chilton and his previous employers Carlin are set for their debut with IndyCar over in the USA
