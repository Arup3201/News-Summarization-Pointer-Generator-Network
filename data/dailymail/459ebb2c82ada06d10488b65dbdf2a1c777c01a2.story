Mark Zuckerberg is now believed to be the richest person under 30 in U.S. history after his personal wealth rocketed by $3.2billion in just one day on the back of Facebook. 

It has been ten years since the 29-year-old founded the social network in his Harvard dorm room and despite accumulating an unimaginable fortune from his invention, Zuckerberg maintains the altruistic belief that the site is a 'service for the world'.

Facebook's stock closed at an all-time high on Thursday after shares rose as much as 17 per cent to $62.50. The hike took Zuckerberg's own fortune to an estimated $32billion.

When asked about his company's phenomenal success this week, Zuckerberg put it down to the fact that he, and his employees, simply 'cared more'.

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg gave an interview on the 10-year anniversary of Facebook where he described it as a 'service for the world'

In an interview with the Today show's Savannah Guthrie, due to air in full on Tuesday, Zuckerberg said: 'At the time I thought, ''You know,
 someone needs to build a service like this for the world.''...But I just never thought that we'd be the ones to help do it.'

He said he remembered clearly sharing the first version of the website with his college friends while they ate pizza.

Zuckerberg's personal wealth now stands at around $32billion after ten busy years. However it's not always been smooth sailing - in 2004, Zuckerberg faced lawsuits from fellow Harvard students the Winklevoss twins and Divya Narendra who claimed he had stolen their ideas. Zuckerberg settled with them for 1.2million in shares (which equated to $300million at the company's IPO in 2012).

The network's social impact is undeniable -  the company ended 2013 with $1.23 billion users and has changed the way that the world interacts. In 2010, a movie The Social Network told the Facebook story.

Along being one of the wealthiest under-30s in the world, Zuckerberg lives a relatively low-key existence.

He married long-time girlfriend Priscilla Chan in 2012 in the backyard of their unflashy Palo Alto home. The couple had been dating since 2003 after meeting in line for the bathroom at a frat party at Harvard.

The
 newlyweds' California home, a five-bedroom house bought for an estimated 
$7million, was Zuckerberg's first notable property investment. Until 
this time, he had lived in rented apartments.

He is famous for his uniform-like wardrobe of jeans and T-shirts and drives to work every day in a $40,000 black Volkswagen GTI.

This week, it appears that the company has had the largest single-day rise in 
Facebook's stock since July 2013, which would value the world's largest social network at more than $200 billion.

Facebook's fourth-quarter revenue rose 
to $2.585 billion from $1.585 billion in the year-ago period, beating 
analysts' average expectation of $2.33 billion.

Facebook
 said on Wednesday revenue from mobile ads represented 53 per cent of 
its total fourth-quarter advertising revenue, up from 49 per cent in the
 third quarter.

Facebook 
and rival Google Inc have been looking for ways to generate more revenue
 by harnessing the mobile platform, as more and more users rely on 
smartphones to access the Internet.

Deutsche
 Bank estimated 4 billion people would be accessing the Internet on 
smartphones in 2017, with spending on global mobile advertisement set to
 reach $70 billion by the same year.

Analysts
 identified the company's new photo-sharing service, Instagram, as well 
as a new video ad format and its social search feature, dubbed as graph 
search, as the next big areas of growth for Facebook.
