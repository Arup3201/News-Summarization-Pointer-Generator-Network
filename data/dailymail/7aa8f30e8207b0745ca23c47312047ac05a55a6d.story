Her soft southern accent, tumbling blonde locks and glamorous Rolls-Royce entrance on a new E4 
reality show back in 2011 won her an army of fans 
nationwide.

But after her on-off relationship with Spencer Matthews took a turbulent
turn for the worse, Made In Chelsea star Caggie packed her Louis Vuitton bags and jetted out
of London for the bright lights of New York.

Now though, as MIC returns for a new season, it seems that 24-year-old Caggie is back on home turf and keen to remind viewers that she's building a brand without the help of the show.

Guess who's back! Original Made In Chelsea star Caggie Dunlop is modelling a new range for ISWAI (jacket, £135)

Caggie, who counts Millie Mackintosh as her BFF - she was one of the few Chelsea clique invited to her wedding - is back in town and is ready to show Chelsea (and 
Spencer) what they're missing in a photo shoot for her new 
clothing line, ISWAI.

ISWAI ('It starts with an
idea') is an online fashion retailer emulating Asos, which sells 
garments from up-and-coming designers -including those designed by Caggie herself.

Launched in 2012, Caggie developed the label with her mother to capture her own distinctive style and 
the collection has quickly expanded and extended its range into fashion 
pieces, accessories and jewellery.

Caggie
 has unveiled ISWAI's SS14 collection and is joined in the campaign by 
three young ISWAI followers, who won a competition to join the shoot.

On trend: Caggie has taken tips from the catwalk and incorporated pretty pastel shades into her new range (skirt, £45, jacket, £60)

Sports luxe: Caggie has worked a lot of denim into the new range, which offers cute skater skirts (£35) and cool hooded jackets (£50)

Feminine florals: Sticking to the season's trends, Caggie has worked pretty flowers into her co-ords (jacket, £50, trousers, £45)

Her latest range of skinny jeans, hooded jackets and hot metallics, aim to deliver an 'aspirational design aesthetic mixed with fashionable wardrobe staples', says the star.

Taking tips from the season's catwalks, floral prints are out in full bloom with a statement Capri-designed trouser suit being one of the most eye-catching pieces.

There's also plenty of oh-so-now 
pastel shades jazzed up with metallic textures and Caggie's spring 
jackets incorporate the brand’s signature turquoise hue.

Speaking
 about her latest offering, Caggie said: 'ISWAI is growing as a brand 
and this collection is our most exciting yet, with the help of three  
gorgeous girls who were hand picked from our ISWAI model competition, we
 created the perfect ISWAI shoot, epitomising the spirit of the brand, 
which is all about comfort and style combining effortlessly.'

Winners: Caggie has unveiled ISWAI's SS14 collection and is joined in the campaign by three young ISWAI followers who won a competition to join the shoot

BFFs: Caggie and Millie have been best friends for ten
years and she attended Millie's Somerset wedding

Former flame: Caggie became famous for her 
on/off relationship with co-star Spencer Matthews but says they don't 
see each other much anymore
