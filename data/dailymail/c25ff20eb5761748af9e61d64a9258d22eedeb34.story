A Muslim who ran a scheme to prevent violent extremism yesterday became the first Briton to be found guilty of travelling to Syria to fight in the civil war.

Police said the conviction of Mashudur Choudhury, 31, was likely to pave the way for others returning from the fighting to be prosecuted.

The father of two went to fight with Al Qaeda to escape the shame of lying to his family about suffering from cancer.

Choudhury, from Portsmouth, borrowed £35,000 from his family, claiming it was for medical treatment.

Mashudur Choudhury, 31, from Portsmouth, Hampshire, travelled to the war-torn Middle Eastern country with the intention of joining a terrorist training camp last October. He was arrested on his return at Gatwick Airport

But he blew it on foreign holidays, a luxury car and prostitutes.

Desperate to atone for his actions and ‘make something of himself’ he resolved to become a martyr fighting the brutal regime of Bashar Assad.

But he is believed to have failed the selection process to join a hardline group of Syrian rebels and was thrown out of their training camp in disgrace.

He was arrested by British anti-terror police on his return to Gatwick in October last year.

After a 12-day trial at Kingston Crown Court, West London, Choudhury was found guilty of engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorist acts.

Prosecutor Alison Morgan said: ‘The evidence clearly shows this defendant planned for and then travelled to Syria with the intention of attending a training camp.’

Four younger men who travelled with Choudhury remained behind. Another, Iftikhar Jaman, was killed fighting in Syria in December.

Choudhury’s motivation for travelling to Syria emerged when counter-terrorist police investigated his background and business affairs.

During the two-week trial at Kingston Crown Court, south-west London, jurors heard that Choudhury travelled to Syria (pictured) on October 8 last year with four other men from his local area

Miss Morgan said he was ‘leaving the shame of the life he had behind him to fight and become a martyr and make something of himself’. Choudhury once ran a Muslim youth group and worked as a racial awareness officer for Portsmouth council, where he helped to run the Government’s Prevent programme to counter violent extremism. But he gave up the job after less than two years to open a café near his local mosque. The business failed and he lost £17,000 borrowed from his sister-in-law.

In 2010, after accumulating further debts, he suddenly told his wife he had cancer. He then borrowed £35,000 from his family for non-existent ‘treatment’, but used it to go on a spree.

He made three trips to Singapore where he posed as a businessman while hiring £200 prostitutes and texting false updates about fake hospital operations to his family.

Despite growing debts, he bought a £17,000 Audi A6 and made three trips to Morocco with friends, telling his wife he was on business.

On his return he became desperate to make up for his actions and decided to travel to Syria to die alongside other Muslim fighters.

Police believe he met members of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, a group that was thrown out of  Al Qaeda for being too extreme.

But the group is thought to have chucked him out after he failed to make the grade during training.

Investigators found messages he had exchanged with his wife, Toslima Akhtar, on social networking sites. In one, she told him: ‘Your treatment of me, I just want to die. I hate your attitude. May you die.

‘I hate you... you want to die in battlefield, go die. I really mean it, just go. I’ll be relieved at last.’ Miss Akhtar, 34, only found out about his lies when the trial opened.

But she gave evidence to defend him, saying: ‘He’s gone mad. He says things like this out of the blue. It’s ridiculous.’

The security services fear radicalised fighters returning from Syria could turn their sights on domestic targets. They say hundreds of British men have joined the fighting.

Trial judge Mr Justice Dodgson warned Choudhury that he faced a substantial prison sentence when he returned to court on June 13.

Assistant Chief Constable Brendan O’Dowda said: ‘Anyone thinking of travelling to fight jihad against the Assad regime, think again. You are likely to be killed or kidnapped and if you return to the UK you are likely to be arrested.’
