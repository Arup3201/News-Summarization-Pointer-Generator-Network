The Health Service cannot be treated like an open all hours Tesco store, doctors warned yesterday.

They claimed plans for seven-day services were wasteful and could even threaten patient safety.

Outpatient clinics and routine operations on Saturdays and Sundays would lead to similar services being cancelled in the week, according to the British Medical Association.

It says the strategy is wholly unrealistic because it will intensify demand without providing any extra cash to meet it.

Dr Mark Porter of the BMA said this move would require services scaled back at other times 

Mark Porter, chairman of the BMA’s council, said: ‘The BMA has been clear in its support for better seven-day services, but the Government needs to be clear about what an expansion of services will look like and, crucially, how it can be safely staffed and resourced, without existing services being scaled back. Doctors already work around the clock, 24/7, so the existing [salary] contract is not a roadblock to seven-day services.’

The BMA makes its opposition clear in evidence given to a review of doctors’ pay in the event of a seven-day NHS.

‘There have been suggestions likening providing NHS services over seven days to Tesco supermarkets opening seven days a week; these take no account of the challenges faced by the NHS in implementing seven-day services,’ it says.

‘Indeed even supermarkets do not operate at full capacity or offer a full suite of service throughout the day, seven days a week.’

Offering a full range of NHS services at weekends is ‘neither desirable nor feasible’ and the costs of implementation would outweigh the benefits.

The BMA says it is important to tackle the ‘weekend effect’ whereby death rates go up in hospital on Saturdays and Sundays. But it says this should not mean having to fund extra services just because it is more convenient to patients.

Making a consultant work weekends would entail finding a replacement during the week to avoid putting patients at risk, the GMC says. ‘We believe that pursuing an ill-informed seven-day service model would be at best wasteful for the NHS and at worst threaten patient safety,’ adds the BMA submission published yesterday.

NHS England has pledged to start offering a wide range of services on all seven days of the week to improve the care patients receive at weekends, and also to better fit in with patients’ working lives.

When he made the commitment in 2013, Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS England’s medical director, said the dramatic expansion would cover much more than simply emergency care, which is already close to a 24/7 service in many places.

‘It is also about access to doctors, diagnostics and elective operations so people do not have to miss work to get healthcare,’ said Sir Bruce. ‘If someone needs a day-case operation, why can’t they have that on Saturday, recover on Sunday and be back to work on Monday?’

The professor wants hospitals to have access to X-rays, ultrasound scans and emergency general surgeries at weekends and believes mental health and community care services also need to be available 24/7 if the expanded role is to work.

NHS England said 2015 would see ‘significant progress’ toward the goal of a seven-day service.

The Department of Health said: ‘Patients expect to receive the same standard of care regardless of the day of the week. A seven-day NHS service will speed up diagnosis and discharge times as well as reducing the amount of time patients need to spend in hospitals at weekends.’
