They might not have had quite as rapturous a reception as 'WillKat' but 'ChaCam', as the local media has christened them, certainly know how to put on a show.

So far, the star is proving to be Camilla who showed off her increasingly confident sense of style during a reception at the British ambassador's residence in Washington D.C last night.

Resplendent in a shimmering silk gown by Bruce Oldfield and her trademark pearl choker, the Duchess of Cornwall cut a glamorous figure as she arrived on the arm of Prince Charles.

But Camilla isn't the only one who has proved a hit with the US public, with Charles also pulling in the crowds - most obviously during a whistle-stop tour of Washington's many monuments yesterday.

Arriving to cries of 'Welcome your Highness!', a clearly delighted Prince of Wales happily stopped to chat to schoolchildren and their parents outside the Lincoln Memorial.

Not everyone knew who they were however, with one little boy asking his mother: 'Who is that man?'

'The future King of England,' she replied as she swiftly snapped a photo on her iPhone.

Charles and Camilla are now on the third day of a four-day state visit that has been described as 'your grandfather's royal visit' by the local Washington Post.

Warm welcome: Both Charles and Camilla have enjoyed a rapturous reception from local people

In a piece headlined, 'Camilla and Charles don’t get the WillKat [William and Kate] treatment, but it’s still royal', the paper went on to contrast the 'high-volume excitement worthy of boy-band' that greeted the Duke  of Cambridge with the quieter one offered to his father.

But while Charles and Camilla aren't getting the rockstar reaction enjoyed by the younger generation, the visit is seen as 'crucial' - for Charles at least.

That echoes comments made by British Ambassador to the US Sir Peter Westmacott who described the tour as being a fillip for Anglo-American relations. 

'I am so pleased to welcome The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall back to the United States, ten years after their first official visit together,' he said ahead of the royal couple's arrival on Tuesday night.

Looking around: Charles and Camilla spent their first full day touring Washington D.C

Star of the show: Camilla, who is clearly been enjoying the tour, has enjoyed a particularly warm welcome

'Their trip to Washington and Kentucky will showcase the best of the transatlantic relationship - promoting democratic values, combating climate change, preserving the natural environment, creating opportunities for the next generation - and provide yet another reminder of the essential role the Royal Family play in keeping that relationship special.' 

Much of the itinerary is taken up with marking big anniversaries, among them the 800th birthday of the Magna Carta and the 150th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's assassination.

Both were ticked off the list yesterday, with Charles and Camilla starting the day at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington and, in Charles' case, ending it at the National Archives for a viewing of the 1297 Magna Carta.

Today's schedule, which, if yesterday is any indication, will also be covered rather breathlessly by the local press, will see 'ChaCam' visit President Lincoln's cottage in Washington D.C.

Later, the royal couple will be whisked to the White House where they will meet President Obama in the Oval Office for the second time since he took office.

President Obama is the sixth American president to entertain Charles, who has visited the US on 23 separate occasions, during his royal career and is unlikely to be the last.
