Learning supervisor Tracey Graham forged an 'obsessive' relationship with a teenager, repeatedly calling her and sending inappropriate messages

A learning supervisor who forged an 'obsessive' relationship with a teenager has been spared jail.

Tracey Graham, 35, admitted harassing a child over a period of ten months, repeatedly ringing her and texting her inappropriate messages. 

Graham, of Alnwick, Northumberland, also made the child a CD of love songs and took her on a day trip to Edinburgh zoo. 

Newcastle Crown Court heard how Graham was working as a learning supervisor at a Northumberland School when the offence took place. 

In one message, Graham messaged the teenager saying: 'Goodnight beautiful princess, I love you so much, sweet dreams xx'

Another text message read: 'You are the most important person in my life. Love you.'

Prosecutor Gavin Doig said: 'The defendant had been calling her, messaging her and sending her cards. 

'This shows the obsessive nature of the relationship that had developed. 

'The victim said "stop texting me please, will you delete my number. I have got all this built up and it’s beginning to make me feel sick. You are a caring person but this is past caring".

'The defendant accepts holding the child’s hand and hugging her but said it went no further, it was not sexual.'

Defence lawyer Ros Scott-Bell said: 'She can see what went wrong but at the time she was leaned upon by the child.

'Most of the people who know her speak of her desire to help. She volunteers and she goes out of her way to help and it appears that is what she did on this occasion.

Graham accepted holding the child's hand and hugging her, but said their relationship went no further, the court heard

'I accept she went totally over the top and smothered the relationship and she should have known better. 

'But it was one that she closed her eyes to. It was one that was not sexually motivated and she failed to see the impact she was having on the young girl. It wasn’t set out from the start.'

A statement from the victim read: 'She said she was my friend. She is the one that has hurt me most.'

Judge Penny Moreland sentenced Graham to eight weeks imprisonment, suspended for 12 months.

The judge also granted a five year restraining order banning her from contacting the girl.

Judge Moreland told Graham: 'It is absolutely clear to me and should be clear to all listening to these remarks that you were not behaving from the best of intentions. You behaved in a way that was selfish and obsessive. The fault for what happened is yours.'
