Andrew Smith is facing jail over having sick cartoon pictures of Bart Simpson having sex with his sister and mother

A pro-incest campaigner is facing jail over sick cartoon pictures of Bart Simpson having sex with his sister Lisa and mother Marge. 

Andrew Smith, 55, from Kendal, in Cumbria, claimed the images were research for a book he was planning to write about why he thinks incest should be made legal. 

Other images showed Bart having sex with his teacher Mrs Krabappel as well as his best friend Millhouse having sex with his mother.

In a statement to Carlisle Crown Court, Smith said he wanted to promote ‘the enjoyment of sex and loving relationships within families.

He added: 'I want it to be accepted that sexual relationships between brother and sister, father and daughter and mother and son should be decriminalised.'

Smith, who is a full-time carer for his 87-year-old mother, was found guilty of nine counts of possessing prohibited images of children as young as eight, after 36 sketches, drawings, cartoons and computer-generated images, many showing sexual relationships between children and older relatives, were found on disks at his home.

He said: 'I was researching the legitimacy of incest and downloaded the images to show that from an artist’s point-of-view incest is love, a wonderful, expressive thing.

'I’m not trying to promote inbreeding or the production of incestuously-conceived children but solely the enjoyment of sex and loving relationships within families.

'I want it to be accepted that sexual relationships between brother and sister, father and daughter and mother and son should be decriminalised.'

Smith told the jury he had downloaded the images to ‘enhance’ the book.

The pictures included sex scenes between relatives including characters from cartoons such as The Simpsons and King of the Hill.

All of the images were cartoons, sketches, drawings or CGIs. None were actual photographs.

Smith also told the court his ‘campaign’ included lowering the age of consent for sex to 12 for boys and that a relationship between a 65-year-old man and his 12-year-old granddaughter would be acceptable ‘as long as she wanted it’.

He said: 'Homosexuals became legal, lesbians became legal, so now there’s only incest left and I want that to follow.'

Roger Baldwin, defending Smith, said: 'He did not download these items with a view to sexual titillation or arousal or anything like that.

'He does not wish to have any sexual activities with any child.

'He was hoping to use these images to form part of this publication, this book, or whatever he was going to produce when he had the time to do it.'

Smith denied using the images for sexual gratification or having a sexual interest in ‘pre-pubescent’ children, saying: 'I hate them. I’d machine gun them all.'

However, Tim Evans, prosecuting, questioned why Smith had still not made a start on his book more than a decade after first beginning his ‘research’.

He said: 'There’s nothing proper and sensible and indeed certainly not legal about pornographic images of children, whether they be real photos or simulations as these are.

'He takes the view that children can be sexualised, that children can have relationships with adults very, very much their senior and in particular that they can have sexual relationships with their parents, almost irrespective of what the age gap is.'

The images were seized from his home in February last year.

The images were 'filthy, obscene and very disturbing'

Recorder Simon Medland QC

The jury returned a unanimous guilty verdict after less than 40 minutes.

Recorder Simon Medland QC branded the images ‘filthy, obscene and very disturbing’ telling Smith he should ‘expect imprisonment’.

Smith told the court he lost his virginity at the age of 12 to a 15-year-old girl and said that was why he thought the age of consent should be lowered. 

He said: 'A child should be able to have sex with any age. They’re not children if they have a full erection.' adding: 'I’m trying to change English law. It’s ridiculous.'

Smith has a previous conviction from 1975 when he was 17 and he was prosecuted for criminal damage.

In his police interview after he was arrested he accepted responsibility for the images but refused to accept any of them are illegal. 

He also told police he thought the law was ‘ridiculous censorship’.

Smith pleaded not guilty to all nine charges and specifically requested a jury trial so he could bring his campaign to court.

He said he found some of the cartoon images ‘funny’ adding: 'If I walked into the pub and showed that to my mates they’d laugh their heads off.'

According to Smith his interest in changing the law happened after a gay friend of his was beaten at school.

Smith says he went away and read the Buggery Act of 1533 which said anyone who was homosexual should be hanged. 

His statement read out in court said: 'I was researching the legitimacy of incest and downloaded the images to show that from an artist’s point-of-view incest is love - a wonderful, expressive thing.

'I’m not trying to promote inbreeding or the production of incestuously-conceived children but solely the enjoyment of sex and loving relationships within families.

'I want it to be accepted that sexual relationships between brother and sister, father and daughter and mother and son should be decriminalised.'

Smith, who was convicted on nine counts of possessing prohibited images, will be sentenced on August 29 at Carlisle Crown Court.
