Diafra Sakho wants to be West Ham’s version of Didier Drogba and believes the Premier League is in desperate need of more players like the Chelsea striker.

The Senegalese forward is on fire with five goals in his last five games since his £4.5million move from Metz in the summer.

After heading in the winner against Queens Park Rangers on Sunday, Sakho revealed that Chelsea’s Drogba, now in his second spell at Stamford Bridge and once one of the most feared strikers in the top flight, is his hero.

Sakho says he dreams of becoming as good as Didier Drogba, who returned to Chelsea this summer

Drogba is a Chelsea legend and scored the winning penalty in the 2012 Champions League final

‘It’s because of him that I wanted to have the No 15 at West Ham,’ Sakho said, referencing Drogba’s old shirt number at Chelsea.

‘I like how he plays and the way he plays. I think the game in England needs people like Didier Drogba and I take him as my example.’

Sakho is trying to set an example to his two-year-old daughter, Nadia, by performing at the highest level on the pitch.

The death of his father two years ago inspired the 24-year-old to strive for greater achievements in the game.

He added: ‘I have made sacrifices since my father died two years ago and the birth of my daughter, also two years ago. I asked myself: do you want to be just a good professional, always playing at the same level? That’s what motivated me to get to where I am.

‘If I want to give a good education to my daughter and how better to give her a good education as far as football is concerned than by showing her that her father can play at the same high level as the players he used to dream about and see on television.’
