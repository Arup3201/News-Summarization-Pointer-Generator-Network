It's the kind of shot that every basketball player dreams of making in the dying seconds of a game to seal a stunning victory.

And Chase Spreen did just that when he hurled the ball the length of the court to clinch a stunning win for Kentucky's Lindsey College against Georgetown College with two seconds left on the clock.

His team were down 76-78 but his three points brought about the unlikely win.

As the ball went in the arena erupted and the game's announcer was beside himself with excitement shouting 'Holy cow' and 'Oh my gosh'.

Coming ever closer, the ball heads in on a perfect trajectory in front of stunned onlookers

The three point shot ended the game 79-78 sending the player's team and fans wild

Get in there! The ball rattles in the hoop to the delight of fans and the astonishment of the game's commentators

'He hit it from the free throw line on the other side!' he shouted down the microphone.

'Unbelievable! It's the most unbelievable shot I've ever seen in my life!'

Fans rushed over to Spreen, surrounding him and eventually lifting him on to their shoulders.

'We had just two seconds so there was
really just one thing to do and that was to just heave it,' Mr Spreen 
said in an interview following the game with LWC Athletics.

Recovering the ball after two failed 
free throw attempts by Georgetown, Mr Spreen said he was already 
anticipating getting the ball in those final seconds after sensing the 
team's failed last shot.

Racing into position under the net, Mr Spreen swept up the ball but just had seconds' time to inch closer toward their net.

'So I shot the rebound off the miss and let it go and it went in and thank God,' he said.

On Monday the Mid-South Conference 
named the college senior their Men's Basketball Player of the Week and 
the shot was also featured on ESPN SportsCenter's top-10 countdown at 
number two.

Out of the Mid-South Conference's ten
competing colleges Mr Spreen is its second highest rated player for 
free throw shots and eighth for three-point shots.

Lindsey Wilson is currently 5-1 in the conference.

The delight on the faces of players and team-mates is plain to see as they celebrate an unlikely victory
