Speed. Pure, unadulterated acceleration with gears to spare. It’s what makes Usain Bolt a track icon and its pursuit fuels the multi-million pound F1 circuit.

It was the also the underlying theme of a memorable opening day at the biggest Flat meeting of the season.

Twice Richard Hughes experienced that wind in the hair feeling most of us can only expect on a roller-coaster.

First odds-on favourite Toronado carried him up the straight mile faster than the dual champion claimed he could ever recall to land the Queen Anne Stakes by three-quarters of length from Verrazano, giving new trainer Richard Hannon a winner at this meeting with his first runner.

Then Sole Power, in the words of Hughes, ‘made up ‘five lengths in 50 yards’ to capture the King’s Stand Stakes for the second successive year.

But Hughes, riding 2,000 Guineas winner Night of Thunder, was left facing the back draft from the most spectacular burst of pace as Kingman and James Doyle engaged the after-burner and flew to victory in the St James’s Palace Stakes.

When the pair had met in the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket, it had been Night of Thunder who won but the tactical nature of the race had left questions hanging in the air as to who really was the best.

When Kingman subsequently romped home in the Irish 2,000 Guineas, the debate became even louder.

Doyle turns around to taunt his rivals as Kingman proves much the best in the St James's Palace Stakes

Hughes tried to tactically wrong-foot his younger weighing room rival by unexpectedly making the running on Night Of Thunder but it proved a fruitless gesture as Kingman’s demolition – the two-and-a-quarter-length margin does not do his superiority justice – emphatically settled the argument over who is the best.

In his moment of triumph, Doyle spontaneously turned to his rivals, putting his finger to his lips. Afterwards, he admitted to be touch embarrassed by the gesture.

He need not have been. He had just been part of one of those sporting moments that send a frisson of excitement down the spine.

It was the sort of ride Doyle must have hoped for when last summer he was signed up by Kingman’s owner Prince Khaled Abdullah and one probably not seen at Royal Ascot since another colt carrying the Abdullah silks, a certain Frankel, blitzed his way to victory in the 2012 Queen Anne Stakes.

Doyle said: ‘I probably let my emotions get the better of me crossing the line as I got so much satisfaction from that.

All smiles: Doyle couldn't hide his joy at Kingman's stellar performance

‘A lot horse has been said about the 2,000 Guineas and it just proves he is the best three-year-old over a mile.

‘I was very confident today. I didn’t think Night Of Thunder could beat us.

‘Everyone thought he wasn’t a champion after the Guineas but he  has put that well behind him now.’ Gosden, winning the St James’s Palace Stakes for the first time, added: ‘Despite losing in the Guineas I always took the opinion he was the better horse. You push an button and he is away.’ 

Gosden will now aim Kingman at next month’s Sussex Stakes at Glorious Goodwood lining up a heavyweight clash with Toronado, who justified all the bold words of Hannon in the build up to the meeting.

Sole Power could make a much quicker reappearance with trainer Eddie Lynam considering running the sprinter alongside stablemate Slade Power in Saturday’s Diamond Jubilee Stakes.

Channel 4 have signed up Frankie Dettori to add some pizzazz to their under scrutiny coverage so it was appropriate the Italian should land the Coventry Stakes on John Quinn-trained The Wow Factor.

Dettori, who drew a blank at this meeting last year, needs only two more wins to make it 50 at the royal meeting.

On a day when pace was king, US flyer Hootenanny was provided the perfect finale to win the Windsor Castle Stakes, justifying trainer Wesley Ward’s belief that colt was the best chance of six runners  at the meeting.
