Opinion-splitter: Love it or hate it, Marmite's popularity shows no sign of flagging

If you hate it, you won't give two hoots.

But if you love it, this new tool could herald the beginning of a new chapter in your breakfast life.

Marmite have invented a special knife enabling you to scrape every last morsel of the gooey black stuff from the bottom of its awkwardly shaped jar.

The Marmife (see what they did there?) 
has been specifically designed for use on those hard-to-reach round nooks and troublesome crannies during a Marmergency - typically defined as the moment when the pot has virtually run dry and the 
shops are closed.

This special tool - the result of an intense 18 month development process - was created due to overwhelming demand from disgruntled fans unable to relish every last savoury smidgen of Marmite from its pot.

It's a Marmergency! The Marmife kit includes a Marmife, The Little Book Of Marmite Tips, and a pot of Marmite to get you started

Marmite spokesperson, Joanne O'Riada, 
said: 'We've had comments from our Facebook community about the 
difficulty people have in getting all their Marmite out of the jar.

'Now, finally, we have a solution that reaches the spots other utensils just can't get to.'

The silicone spatula is shaped around
a steel core to give it the balance and weight required to get into the
hard-to-reach corners of a 125g and 250g jar.

Victoria Jackson from the design team
Kimm & Miller said: 'We've spent ages staring at the bottom of the 
jar to work out the best solution and I've got to say, its been a real 
labour of love. After 15 re-designs to get the Marmife just right, I think we've finally done it.'

Alongside the launch of their Marmife, Marmite are also releasing their limited edition Marmite Gold.

The sparkly spread boasts the same unique 'love it or hate it' taste, but packaged in a gold jar and with the addition of real edible gold flecks.

To celebrate the precious pot, the brand is also sponsoring London's 2012 Oxford Street Christmas lights -  and for the first time ever people will have the chance to appear within the mile long display along the world's favourite high street.

Power tool: The Marmite Marmife, which plans to bring an end everyone's end-of-the-jar woes

Christmas time: The Oxford Street lights will be sponsored by Marmite this year

Miss O'Riada said: '2012 has certainly been a great year for Britain – from the Queen's Jubilee to unprecedented sporting achievements – so what better way to top it all off than giving everyone the chance to shine in this years Oxford Street Christmas lights.

The display, which features classic animated Christmas characters with a love/hate twist, will run from Marble Arch to Poland Street for a six week period.

People will also be given the chance to tell the world what they think of Marmite, on a specially designed banner overlooking Selfridges.

People can get their moment of fame by uploading a photo on Marmite's Facebook page, after which they will be sent an email with the designated time frame for when their image will appear.

Those who can't make it down to the capital needn’t worry about missing out as they will still be able to see their 'face in lights' via a live webcam and an online gallery.

Shoppers on Oxford Street will also be able to get involved through an interactive bus shelter located near Bond Street tube station.

From 26 November the shelter will house a camera for shoppers to take a photo which will be uploaded to the lights within three minutes.

Marmite Gold is available in retailers nationwide and online for £3.99 (250g jar). The Marmife pack - which includes the Marmife, a 250g jar of Marmite and The Little Book of Marmite Tips - is available exclusively at Debenhams, for £13.99

The Marmite Food Company was set up in 1902, later renamed Marmite Ltd, in Burton On Trent.

The sticky black spread was made using the concentrated cells of brewer's yeast, and little has changed in the production method since then.

What's in a name: Marmite originally came in a small earthenware pot, similar to the kind of French casserole dish called a 'marmite'

The yeast is broken down to release soluble amino acids and proteins. This soluble material is then concentrated and filtered a few times before going through a unique process for flavour development.

A blend of vitamins - as well as vegetable and spice extracts - is then added to create Marmite's unique taste.

In fact, thanks to its high B vitamin content, Marmite was included in soldiers ration packs during the First World War. It also became a staple food in hospitals and schools.

During World War II, Marmite became a dietary supplement in prisoner-of-war camps, and in 1999, it was sent to British peacekeeping forces in Kosovo.

Marmite originally came in a small earthenware pot, similar to the kind of French casserole dish called a 'Marmite'. This may be where Marmite gets its name from.

You can still see the original 'Marmite' dish pictured on the front of the pot, but the firm began using glass jars in the 1920s.

The shape of the jar and the distinctive red and yellow label have remained pretty much the same since then, with the occasional novelty jar or tube being released on special occasions, such as Queen Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee.

Marmite celebrated its 100th birthday in 2002.
