What a minx! Kim kept it kinky at LFW with a latex dress by Atsuko Kudo. Yet her look had a demure edge due to its pink hue and she draped a coordinatingly colored fur coat over her shoulders.

We love following her style evolution from an over the top bombshell to a woman who balances sexy and sultry with quirky and edgy.

We couldn't have done a better job had we styled it ourselves with those clear strappy heels and hair swept back off the face.

While it may be hard, if not impossible, for us mere mortals to rock latex, we found several similar pinky nude colored options with a leather-like feel. Our suggestions are sure to give you just enough va-va-voom without going ka-boom.

On Thursday night, Rita Ora, 24, stepped out for the Mert & Marcus House of Love party in celebration of Madonna wearing a near-identical latex dress to the queen of curves herself.

Both designs were by Atsuko Kudo and while Kim, 34, went for a high-collared look, Rita's came with a metal adorned choker.

Kim has long championed the style. She wore a strikingly similar look by the same the designer back in November for a fragrance launch in Australia.

The £274 blush pink ensemble was the third time in just a few months Kim Kardashian wore the look, after pouring herself into a black bodice at the GQ Woman Of The Year awards in September, and to watch husband Kanye West perform at Made In America in Los Angeles in August.

Mrs Kanye West isn't the only celebrity to wear Atsko Kudo designs: the elaborate red dress Lady Gaga wore to meet Queen Elizabeth in 2009 was created by the designer

Speaking to MailOnline about the bra and pencil skirt combo at the time, the brand’s managing director, Simon Hoare, said: ‘Latex fits so much to the body that to the naked eye it’s very difficult to tell if it’s a top and a skirt, or a dress,’ he said.

Kim’s skin-tight outfit appears to leave little room for underwear, and Simon admitted it generally looks better if the wearer does go sans pants. 

‘It’s probably better without if you can manage it – but I’d have to leave that up to the lady in question’. 

The co-founder of the label said that they have met with the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star to discuss her beloved latex outfits.

‘We have met Kim and chatted about what she likes,’ he confirmed.

‘Atsko designs with 100 per cent the female body in mind, and of course Kim is just embodying the feminine shape right now.

‘[The outfits] are very feminine and very empowering.’

Sarah, Duchess of York, left, Kate Moss, centre, and singer Charli XCX, right, have all trailled the trend (although some looks are more daring than others)

Mrs Kanye West isn’t the only celebrity to wear Atsko Kudo designs: the elaborate red dress Lady Gaga wore to meet Queen Elizabeth in 2009 was created by the designer, and Kate Moss, Beyonce, Janet Jackson, Dita Von Teese and Linda Evangelista are all customers. 

Nancy Dell’Olio, Kylie Minogue and Sarah, Duchess of York have all stepped out in high-shine latex designs and the AW15 catwalks over fashion week were awash with risque looks.

Julien Macdonald is unapologetic about his love for high octane glamour, but his AW15 collection was a departure from the usual feast of glitter and sequins that he has made his signature.

The Welsh designer and Strictly Come Dancing star embraced gothic glamour in his London show.

Julien's racy designs were overtly sexual but managed to maintain that sense of sophistication that makes him a red carpet favourite.

DAKS sent models down the runway wearing red latex boots and toting matching bags

Dominatrix-esque models took to the runway wearing thick chokers, long black gloves and embellished luxe silks.

Dresses, both long and short, came with peek-a-boo cutouts and were worn with thigh-high leggings, ensuring the Julien woman garners attention for all the right reasons. 

Meanwhile, Pam Hogg's models wore head-to-toe latex (including capes, thigh-high boots and hats in the material). DAKS created red latex boots, Emilia Wickstead gave us a lesson in power dressing with her black latex dress and Sibling trimmed their high shine coats with fur. 

Speaking about the trend, Lydia Jones, founder of WantHerWardrobe.com, said: 'Forget your leather skinnies, everyone from Kim Kardashian to Rita Ora is rocking latex and it has become a must-have trend for this season. 

'If you're a little daring, try a latex cupped bodycon dress at midi length - these are great for flattering your figure and enhancing your curves in all the right places. For those who are a little wary, try a latex pencil midi skirt with a casual tee tucked in for a more easy and casual look.'
