A dangerous driver who led police on a 40-minute chase travelling at speeds of up to 120mph the wrong way down a motorway has been jailed.

Mark Jones led traffic officers on a tense high-speed pursuit - ramming vehicles, weaving between cars and mounting the curb.

Jones, 28, from Birmingham, West Midlands, sped off after police tried to pull him over after in South Yorkshire on the M1.

The spectacular footage was taken from a police helicopter following the action as the chase crossed into Derbyshire down the busy motorway.

At one point the dangerous driver attempts to outmanoeuvre the police by hurtling back down the wrong carriageway and going up a slip road - narrowly avoiding on coming cars.

Moments later he comes to a roundabout and decides to try and blend in with the traffic - but quick thinking motorists attempt to box him in.

A brave police officer tries to bring the daredevil driver to a halt. The white police car can be seen cutting across Jones' car which is in the third lane

Astonishingly, as Jones wriggles free, a lorry driver doesn't give up and attempts to ram the suspect.

But he weaves between several cars - including a squad car - before ramming his way out.

Minutes later, the action cuts to Jones speeding along busy residential roads on the wrong side of the road - with shoppers just metres away.

But Jones's luck runs out after 40 
minutes of high-speed action when he reaches a traffic jam and smashes 
into a stopped silver car under a bridge.

Police
can be seen rushing to the scene and pinning Jones's face down on the 
tarmac - while holding a yellow taser gun to his head.

The
incident, which has been described by police as 'one of the worst cases
of dangerous driving ever seen', took place on March 18.

The black Vauxhall Insignia was spotted by South Yorkshire Police at 12.40pm.

But the force quickly alerted their colleagues at Derbyshire Police when Jones headed for the county.

Jones was sentenced to 16 months in prison and disqualified from driving for five years after admitting dangerous driving.

The court imposed no separate penalty 
on Jones for using a vehicle without insurance and driving otherwise 
than in accordance with his licence.

Officer
in the case Police Constable Mark Hallam, of the Roads Policing Unit, 
said: 'This was probably one of the worst cases of dangerous driving 
I've ever seen.

'He rammed 
several police cars, did a U-turn on the motorway and drove at 
ridiculous speeds on the hard shoulder. It was a joint effort to stop 
him in a pursuit that lasted more than 40 minutes.'
