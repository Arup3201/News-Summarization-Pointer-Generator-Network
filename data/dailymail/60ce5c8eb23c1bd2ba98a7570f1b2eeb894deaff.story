A Pennsylvania doctor who woke up to find his dead lover's body and disposed of it in a New York parking lot has been sentenced to 15 days in jail.

John Yelcick, 48, was ordered by a Lancaster County judge to report to jail on Friday.

Yelcick previously pleaded guilty to the abuse of a corpse and evidence tampering for moving the body of 45-year-old David Sellers on Sept. 13.

He told investigators the two had had sex and he woke up to find Sellers dead.

Yelcick 'panicked' because he was afraid Sellers had drugs in the home and of possible repercussions if he called 911, according to a report by York Dispatch. He also says he tried to perform CPR.

He says he put the body in Sellers' car, drove it about 30 miles to York and left it in a parking lot.

Sellers' body was found four days later. Tests determined he died from a methamphetamine overdose.

Yelcick was ordered to pay $4,089 in funeral costs and a $2,500 fine, reports Lancaster Online, along with 150 hours of community service.

Yelcick was previously chairman of the Lancaster General Hospital pathology department.

Last month, Sellers' sister Sheri Sellers criticized Yelcick in court for the disposal of her brother's body.

'You took everything that had to do with my brother and you tossed it out,' Sellers said, according to Lancaster Online. 'My God, youâ€™re a doctor.'

'You let him decompose beyond recognition,' she added. 'I never got to see his body or say goodbye. They had to remove his body wearing haz-mat suits.'
