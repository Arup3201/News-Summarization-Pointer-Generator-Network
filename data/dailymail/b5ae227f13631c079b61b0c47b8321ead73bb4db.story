This bronze statue put up in memory of murdered Sarah Payne was stolen from Burhill County Primary School in Hersham, Surrey

A bronze statue in memory of murdered schoolgirl Sarah Payne has been recovered by police after it was stolen from outside her school.

The 2ft statue depicting a young girl was taken from Burhill County Primary School, Hersham, Surrey, yesterday.

It was given to the school in memory of the former pupil who was murdered in 2000.

It was found by a member of the public this morning after Sarah's mother, Dr Sara Payne, had appealed for its safe return.

The statue was found outside an address in Northfield Road, Cobham, this morning. It is believed that it was left outside the property between 5.15am and 7.30am.

Three people are believed to have been involved in the theft.

 A van was also seen in the area around the time of the offence.

Sergeant Marc Nettleingham, of Surrey Police, said: 'The member of the public who found the statue, which is thankfully undamaged, had seen our appeal on Facebook.

'We are continuing to carry out a number of inquiries to identify the offenders responsible for this theft, which is particularly reprehensible given that it was presented to the school in memory of Sarah Payne and the investigation is ongoing.'  

Her mother, Sara, said: 'I implore the the public to help me and the police bring my Sarah's memorial statue back where it belongs'

Eight-year-old Sarah was abducted by paedophile Roy Whiting as she played  in a field outside her grandparents' rural home in West Sussex in 2000

Her mother, Sara, said yesterday: 'Monetary-wise it's not worth that much.

'It's worth far more to the school. 

'The residents feel sick and I feel sick about it.' 

Eight-year-old Sarah was abducted by paedophile Roy Whiting as she played with older brothers Luke and Lee and younger sister Charlotte  in a field outside her grandparents' rural home in Kingston Gorse, West Sussex in July 2000. 

Michael Payne and his then wife Sara made a series of heart-rending appeals for her safe return, but her body was discovered 16 days later in a shallow grave just a few miles away. 

Whiting was sentenced to life behind bars in January 2001, and is held at HMP Wakefield, dubbed the Monster Mansion due to the number of high risk sex offenders imprisoned there. 

It later emerged that Whiting was already on the Sex Offenders Register after abducting and sexually attacking another eight-year-old. 

Her brutal death remains one of Britain's highest profile child murders and led to the introduction of Sarah's Law following a lengthy campaign by her mother.

The rule allows concerned parents or grandparents to contact police to find out if a new boyfriend, or a neighbour, who has contact with a child, has a history of child sex offending. 

Sarah's father, Michael, died aged 45 last October after a long battle with alcoholism.

Her mother was awarded an MBE in 2008 for her campaign work.
