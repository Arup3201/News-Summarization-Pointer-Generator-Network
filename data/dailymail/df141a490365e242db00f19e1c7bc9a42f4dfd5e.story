A ‘silent army’ of stay-at-home parents and people who care for relatives should be offered tax breaks to match those for working couples, say senior Tories.

A group of centre-ground MPs will use next week’s party conference to put pressure on Chancellor George Osborne to boost tax breaks for marriage and extend them to carers.

They will complain about the ‘discrepancy’ between generous support for working couples with children and that for families where one parent stays at home.

The MPs include former Cabinet minister Caroline Spelman, John Glen, a member of the No 10 policy board, Jeremy Lefroy and Fiona Bruce.

From autumn 2015, the Coalition has committed to introducing ‘tax-free childcare’ for dual earner couples, worth up to £2,000 per child. 

Such families will be able to open online accounts, run by HM Revenue and Customs, and National Savings and Investments. 

Any money paid in will attract a subsidy from the Government and the accounts can then be used to pay any registered childcarer.

The subsidy will be worth up to 20 per cent of childcare bills for families earning up to £300,000 where both are in jobs.

But some Conservative MPs say it is unfair that the tax breaks will not be available to couples in which only one parent earns. The Chancellor is introducing a marriage tax allowance from next April designed to help one-earner couples, but it will be worth only around £200 a year.

It will only apply to people paying the basic rate of tax, meaning families with incomes above around £42,000 a year will not be helped.

Laura Perrins, of campaign group Mothers at Home Matter, said: ‘We would welcome any recognition of the cost that families bear when they care for their children themselves and choose not to outsource those costs. 

'At the moment, the system is very much skewed in favour of compensating for those with external childcare costs.’

The MPs will also call for more generous respite care payments to ease the burden on people looking after friends and relatives.

They back tax breaks for what they call ‘unsung heroes’ of social care, saying that where carers work part-time they should be able to reduce their tax bills in return.

The MPs’ report will point out that the value of informal care carried out by family members and friends is estimated at £119billion a year.

Some 6.5million people in the UK are caring unpaid for an ill, frail or disabled family member or friend, and the number providing unpaid care of 50 or more hours per week has increased by 26 per cent over the past decade.

Mr Lefroy said: ‘We have a silent army of informal carers … motivated solely by commitment to their family members or friends. 

'The difficulty lies with families who want to care for their own relatives, but whose financial situation prevents it.

‘The maximum they can claim presently is £60 through the carers’ allowance … They cannot set the financial value of their care against their own tax bills or those of their spouse.

‘They may then have to put their relatives in a full-time nursing home, at a cost of up to £60,000 a year to the state.’ 

He added: ‘This is not about expensive state hand-outs, but recognising and supporting these unsung heroes who provide care because of their selfless commitment to their families.’

Mrs Bruce said the Government ‘needs to go further to help those taking responsibility for the care of their families’.

The report will also voice concern over rising levels of personal debt, which has trebled since 1993, reaching £158billion in 2013. The MPs recommend strengthening affordability tests for lenders, and a cap on the total amount repaid on a loan.

David Cameron has suggested that a majority Tory government would go further than a marriage tax break, calling it ‘very much a first step’.
