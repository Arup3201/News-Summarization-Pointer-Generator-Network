A boy at a top London school woke up during a sex assault to find he was in his paedophile teacher's bed and wearing his underwear.

The revelation came as a former student claimed three of her classmates killed themselves after being abused by William Vahey.

The 64-year-old has been described by the FBI as one of the most prolific sex offenders of all time.

The American woman, who gave her name only as Alysia, was taught by Vahey when she was 12 at Saudi Aramco Schools in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.

Vahey taught at the international school between 1980 and 1992.

Spanning the years, and the globe: William Vahey, pictured, committed suicide after allegedly confessing to molesting young boys 'my whole life'

Vahey, pictured with his wife Jean, killed himself at a US motel last month as FBI agents were poised to investigate a USB memory stick containing dozens of graphic images of naked children dating back to 2008

She told Sky News:  ‘There were three suicides of very popular students of his that were molested by him. I could not believe that this guy was still teaching students.

‘That was the rumour that Bill Vahey molested children and that ultimately three children committed suicide as a result.’

However, when questioned if it was a rumour or fact, she immediately added: ‘It’s not a rumour. I know these people.’

The woman, who said she was in seventh grade at the Saudi Arabia school when she was taught by Vahey, described him as inappropriate.

She said: ‘I found him to make inappropriate remarks to his class. He would make jokes about the male genital and I thought that was very inappropriate for 12 year olds to hear.

‘He was very arrogant. There were just rumours all over the place about ‘Bill’ Vahey and his behaviour.’

She also said the teacher had ‘favourite boy students’, giving them ‘better recommendations’ and ‘better grades’ than others.

Despite finding him ‘inappropriate’, the American woman said she was unaware of Vahey’s behaviour while she was at school and said she started to hear rumours during a school reunion,

She said: It surfaced after we left Saudi Arabia - during a reunion everyone was talking about ‘Bill’ Vahey and his behaviour with male students.’

Vahey targeted young boys at a number of international schools over several years. FBI investigators said more than 100 potential victims had come forward after Vahey committed suicide at a US motel last month

Natalie Salmon, 23, who was at a school where the paedophile teacher worked in Venezuela, said:  'It's so sad, and it's the first time where I've thought to myself as a girl I am safer than being a boy'

Vahey, a U.S. citizen, targeted young boys at a number of international schools including the elite Southbank International School in Westminster, London, where he took pictures of himself abusing up to 60 sleeping students during class trips abroad between 2009 and 2013.

FBI investigators said more than 100 potential victims had come forward after Vahey committed suicide at a US motel last month.

His death came as FBI agents were poised to investigate a USB memory stick containing dozens of graphic images of naked children dating back to 2008.

The 
sickening images depicted children aged ten to 14 at the international 
school, where he taught history and geography and led trips to Jordan, 
Nepal and Venezuela.

Another
 30 children, who also appeared to be unconscious or asleep when the 
assaults took place, were pictured from other schools he worked in 
during a 40-year career spent teaching at ten American international 
schools in nine countries.

An FBI affidavit revealed the extent of Vahey's crimes around the world

The father of two plunged a knife into his chest two days after confessing that he had abused boys throughout his life using sleeping pills.

The news comes after it was revealed the teacher allegedly drugged his victims with sleeping tablets – by hiding them in cookies – before abusing them on school trips.

While working at schools around the world, the teacher was said to have held a ‘cookie race’ at bedtime in which children as young as ten were encouraged to eat as many as they could, unaware they had been drugged. Once the pupils passed out, some were assaulted.

The revelations did not come as a surprise to a former pupil known as Jonathan, who said there was something 'not right' about Vahey from the start.

He told The Guardian: 'I had my suspicions from the beginning. There was something a bit off about him.

'Other people would say he was their favourite teacher but I would say there was something not right.'

Another former student of Vahey's said the revelations were a 'complete shock'.

Natalie Salmon, 23, who was at a school where the paedophile teacher worked in Venezuela, said:  'It’s so sad, and it’s the first time where I’ve thought to myself as a girl I am safer than being a boy.’

Miss Salmon said she remembered Vahey as being a 'nice, shy sort of guy', but that her male friends from school now refuse to even speak about the possibility they were his victims.

An FBI affidavit obtained by the Daily
 Mail showed how he catalogued the sex abuse by time and location in 
folders on a USB memory stick entitled ‘Panama trip’, ‘Costa Rica trip’ 
and ‘Basketball trip’ and ‘Spring 2013’.

The
 document says: ‘These images depict minor males in various states of 
undress... The minor males appear to be asleep, unconscious or possibly 
drugged.’

A former student of a school in the Eastern Province in Saudi Arabia, pictured, claims three pupils committed suicide after being abused by Vahey

Breeding ground: Vahey taught at the elite £25,000-a-year Southbank International School in Westminster, London, pictured, right up until last year

Vahey, who left Southbank International School last year, was only caught after a housekeeper at a school he moved to in Nicaragua stole a memory stick containing the vile images

Saudi Aramco Schools is a group of schools run by the Saudi Arabian Oil Co - a prolific oil company based in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.

The school campuses are situated in four Saudi Arabian Oil Company communities: Abqaiq and 'Udhailiyah in the south, Dhahran in the central area and Ras Tanura in the north.

The Saudi Aramco Schools group was founded in 1945 and currently has around 3,100 students from nursery age up until around 15 years.

Most of the students are the children of the company’s expatriate employees.

Students will only be accepted to the schools if they speak proficient English and were 'successful at their previous school'. 

All of the campuses follow an American curriculum and all of the school sites are modelled on North American schools. 

Classes run from Saturday to Wednesday, with weekends on Thursday and Friday in conformance Saudi Arabia's working week.

Vahey, who left Southbank International last year, was only caught after a housekeeper at a school he moved to in Nicaragua stole a memory stick containing the vile images.

She was sacked but later passed the USB stick to administrators at the American School in Managua, who dismissed Vahey after recognising his hand in the images.

In 1970, while studying for a teaching degree, Vahey was jailed for 90 days after pleading guilty to molesting boys at a swimming pool where he was working as an instructor in California.

He was required to register as a sex offender for life, but after graduating from college in 1972 failed to sign the register.

In 2010 an inspection report had warned of a weakness in staff vetting measures at Southbank International, but Sir Chris Woodhead, chairman of the governors said yesterday that it was ‘irrelevant’ in Vahey’s case as he was not on the sex offender’s register.

Sir Chris said there had never been a complaint against Vahey, although there was one incident where a boy was ill on a trip and Vahey took the boy into his room to look after him.

A school investigation subsequently found ‘nothing untoward’.
