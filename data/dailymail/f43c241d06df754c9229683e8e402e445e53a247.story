Demand: Ian Macdonald QC, pictured in 2004, is one of the 702 law professionals who have signed the letter

Hundreds of lawyers, including some of
the country’s most eminent QCs, today launch a devastating attack
on Government plans for secret courts as ‘contrary to the rule of law’ 
and demand they are dropped.

More than 700 figures from the legal 
profession insist that the Government’s Justice and Security Bill is 
‘dangerous and unnecessary’ and will ‘fatally undermine’ the fairness of
court hearings.

The group of 702, which includes 38 
QCs, says in a letter published in today’s Daily Mail that the proposals
to allow a huge extension of court hearings behind closed doors will 
‘erode core principles of our civil justice system’ by undermining the 
right to a fair trial and open justice.

They include Nicholas Vineall QC, 
former chairman of the Conservative Lawyers’ Association, Reverend 
Nicholas Mercer, a lieutenant colonel who was the Army’s most senior 
lawyer during the Iraq war, and Ian Macdonald QC, who resigned as a 
security-cleared special advocate in protest at the existing use of 
secret justice.

The intervention of such a significant
number of lawyers is a shattering blow for the Government, which had 
been hoping to get the legislation through Parliament as quietly as 
possible following months of controversy. It is expected to return to 
the Commons next week.

In another setback for the Government,
a group of international organisations, including the American Civil 
Liberties Union and similar bodies from Ireland, Canada, South Africa, 
Argentina, Egypt and Hungary, also expressed concerns about the Bill in a
joint statement.

It warned: ‘If the UK Parliament 
passes this proposal into law it will be a huge setback for those of us 
fighting to secure truth and fairness from our own governments and 
within our own justice systems across the world.’

The Daily Mail has led criticism of 
Government plans to allow so-called ‘closed material procedures’ (CMPs),
in which cases are conducted entirely in private, in civil hearings.

Defendants or claimants will not 
allowed to be present, know or challenge the case against them and must 
be represented by a security-cleared special advocate, rather than their
own lawyer.

Currently, such procedures are used in
tiny numbers of immigration and deportation hearings, but the 
Government wants to extend them across the civil courts in cases deemed 
to involve national security.

Secret court: Those who have signed the letter say court hearings behind closed doors 'erodes civil justice system core principles'

The legislation has been drafted in 
close cooperation with the security services, who have claimed other 
countries may stop sharing intelligence with Britain if it risks being 
disclosed in open court.

But critics say the proposals are simply designed to ensure potentially embarrassing cases are conducted behind closed doors.

Reverend Nicholas Mercer, one of the 
most prominent signatories of today’s letter, said: ‘The Justice and 
Security Bill has one principle aim and that is to cover up UK 
complicity in rendition and torture.

‘The Bill is an affront to the open 
justice on which this country rightly prides itself and, above all, it 
is an affront to human dignity. The fact that some of those individuals 
who are complicit in rendition and torture can not only assist in the 
drafting of the Bill but also vote to cover their tracks is a 
constitutional scandal.

‘It is little wonder that the Bill has
been heavily criticised by the UN Rapporteur on Torture and condemned 
by the vast majority of lawyers and human rights organisations in this 
country.’

Michael Fordham QC, one of the 
country's leading public law specialists, warned the Government that if 
it pressed ahead judges might refuse to preside over secret courts.

‘Secret trials undermine the 
principles of open justice and natural justice on which the rule of law 
is built. By promoting the spread of secrecy, state authorities become 
self-immunised from proper public scrutiny, and in relation to the very 
types of actions which most need it,’ he said.

‘Parliament is unwisely provoking the 
untapped power of our unwritten constitution which it could come to 
regret. The last word will not be Parliament's, but that of judges asked
to preside over secret courts. An unwise Parliament may be about to 
find that it has constitutional limits, when the rule of law fights 
back.’

Paul Bowen QC said: ‘The extension of 
closed material procedures is not necessary for public protection.  The 
state is already free to withhold evidence from disclosure under Public 
Interest Immunity procedures.  What is not fair, or just, is evidence 
being shown in secret to the judge who decides the case on the basis of 
that evidence.

‘In those cases where disclosure of 
torture or other human rights abuses by the British government or its 
agents is sought, the public interest surely requires that to be brought
into the open.’

Dinah Rose QC, a former special 
advocate and another signatory, said: ‘Closed material procedures are 
alien to British justice and will distort civil trials beyond 
recognition.

'What may look and sound like a trial is in fact nothing of 
the sort. Judges will be asked to decide cases on the basis of "secret 
evidence" that would not withstand legal challenge and hand down 
judgments in secret. This Bill is a dangerous perversion of our national
legal system and will undermine constitutional rights.’

Shami Chakrabarti, director of civil 
rights group Liberty, said: ‘When will the coalition 
that once championed civil liberties listen to the condemnation of its 
secret courts proposals?

‘Liberty was dismissed as the 
reactionary human rights lobby- but now legal and international 
communities have joined the opposition to secret stitch-ups between 
government and judges, with victims, press and public shut outside. 
Secret justice is a complete perversion - it is no justice at all.’

Minister without portfolio Kenneth 
Clarke, who is in charge of the legislation, will today table further 
amendments supposed to address some of the concerns of critics.

They mean a judge must be satisfied 
that the Government has considered whether to make a claim for public 
interest immunity before making an application for a secret hearing as 
one of the tests to be met. Mr Clarke is also proposing an annual report
on the operation of closed hearings and a full review after five years.

He said: ‘With these final amendments 
the Government has gone to extreme lengths to meet every practical legal
objection that has been made about the Bill. The judge now has total 
discretion over whether to order a closed material procedure following 
an application either by the Government, the claimant, or from the court
of its own motion.

‘I do not believe closed material 
procedures are ideal, but in the very exceptional circumstances where 
national security is at stake, they offer the only practical means of 
delivering justice where otherwise there would be none.

‘CMPs already exist in our justice 
system and the Government does lose in them – sometimes to the great 
anger of the Daily Mail’s readers.

‘This Bill is now proportionate, 
sensible and necessary.  It resolves the highly unsatisfactory legal 
no-man’s land we have at the moment where national security cases can be
brought, but not resolved. 

‘Of course these amendments will not 
reassure the Bill’s hardline critics, who prefer silence to judicial 
decisions on allegations of kidnap and torture, and are prepared to 
accept that millions of pounds could go without challenge to individuals
who could be terrorists.

These final amendments should now resolve all
right thinking citizens that this is a sensible, worthwhile Bill which 
they would give their support to.

'There are few Governments in the 
world who would go to these lengths to ensure that we will uphold 
justice and the rule of law in the process of securely safeguarding the 
safety of our citizens and the national interest.’
