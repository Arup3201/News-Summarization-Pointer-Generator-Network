Many are blaming the murder of two New York City cops on Saturday afternoon on Mayor Bill de Blasio following his recent support for protesters in the city marching in opposition to a grand jury's decision to not indict the police officer who killed Eric Garner.

Hundreds have taken to social media to say that de Blasio has 'blood on his hands' and should 'be charged with murder' after the two men were killed 'execution style' in Brooklyn. 

What's more, many feel that de Blasio should not attend the officers' funerals, this after many members of the NYPD signed a petition asking that the Mayor not attend their service should they be killed in the line of duty in light of his recent actions.

This as hundreds of NYPD members turned their backs on de Blasio as he entered a news conference Saturday afternoon. 

These same officers later lined the streets outside the Woodhull medical Center and silently saluted as the bodies of the two slain officers were taken away. 

Pat Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said in a statement; 'That blood on the hands starts on the steps of City Hall in the office of the Mayor.'

Mayor de Blasio responded to this, saying in a statement; 'It's unfortunate that in a time of great tragedy, some would resort to the irresponsible, overheated rhetoric that angers and divides people.'

Turn around: Hundreds of members of NYPD turned their back on Mayor de Blasio as he entered a news conference on Saturday

Harry Houck, a retired NYPD detective, went on CNN to attack both de Blasio and Al Sharpton.

'I guess Al Sharpton got what he wanted,' said Houck of the civil rights leader. 

Houck then attacked the Mayor for not supporting the leadership in the police department, saying that he should not show up at the funeral or these two officers.

Furthermore, he said Saturday's killings were inevitable as the protesters wanted to 'take out a cop for Eric Garner.'

He then added, 'I've been waiting for something like this to happen.'

Houck later said that he believed police morale was the lowest he had ever seen it in 30 years.

Twitter was even more brutal, with one man, Cole Phelps, writing; 'Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, Barack Obama, Bill De Blasio & Eric Holder should be CHARGED with the MURDER of both #NYPD Officer's.'

Twitter user Day of the Eagle wrote; 'I think one could rightfully say that #DeBlasio has blood on his hands now. 2 Cops shot.' 

Some have even gone as far as to say that members of NYPD should not report to work until Mayor de Blasio resigns. 

Many are also saying that the 'protesters got what they wanted.' 

Former New York City Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik told Newsmax; 'De Blasio, Sharpton and all those who encouraged this anti-cop, racist mentality all have blood on their hands.' 

He later said; 'The lawless have been encouraged by the Mayor.' 

Former New York Governor George Pataki also came out against de Blasio and Holder, saying; 'Sickened by these barbaric acts, which sadly are a predictable outcome of divisive anti-cop rhetoric of #ericholder & #mayordeblasio. #NYPD'

28-year-old shooter Ismaaiyl Abdullah Brinsley from Baltimore, shot his girlfriend on Saturday morning before targeting the two cops, Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos, in Brooklyn.

A Move On petition demanding that Mayor de Blasio resign already has thousands of signatures.

'Today, Saturday December 20th 2014, 5 days before Christmas, 2 NYPD officers were shot and killed in their cruiser for no apparent reason.With the recent news surrounding the NYPD and other law enforcement agencies around the country, our mayor blasted his own police department by throwing them under the bus,' reads the petition. 

'His words and actions on the subject matter of late have to be held accountable. He is unfit to lead this city. He is unfit to have a relationship with his police department for his remaining tenure and he should be taken out of office IMMEDIATELY, with proper protocol to be followed to name a replacement before a special election.'

Sharpton released a statement shortly after the murders, writing; 'I have spoken to the Garner family and we are outraged by the early reports of the police killed in Brooklyn today.

'Any use of the names of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, in connection with any violence or killing of police, is reprehensible and against the pursuit of justice in both cases. 

'We have stressed at every rally and march that anyone engaged in any violence is an enemy to the pursuit of justice for Eric Garner and Michael Brown.

'We have been criticized at National Action Network for not allowing rhetoric or chanting of violence and would abruptly denounce it at all of our gatherings.

'The Garner family and I have always stressed that we do not believe that all police are bad, In fact we have stressed that most police are not bad.

'We plan to hold a press conference in the morning to express our outrage and our condolences to the families and the police department.'

This all comes just one week after police union president Pat Lynch called out Mayor de Blasio at a private meeting.

The New York Post reports that Lynch said; 'He is not running the City of New York. He thinks he’s running a f**king revolution.'

He then added; 'If we won’t get support when we do our jobs . . . then we’re going to do it the way they want it.' 

New York State Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis also called out Mayor de Blasio following Saturday's shooting, saying in a statement; 'It is well past the time for our mayor and citywide leaders to call for a return to order in our streets, and take a hard stance that that lawlessness and aggression towards police officers will not be tolerated.'
