Arsenal have been given fresh hope in their pursuit of William Carvalho, as the Sporting midfielder admitted he still has Premier League ambitions.

Carvalho, who was a target for the Gunners this summer but remained in Portugal, said he has ambitions to play in the best leagues in the world, the Premier League or La Liga, and that he expects the move to happen 'sooner or later'.

But the Portuguese international explained that despite interest from Europe's top clubs, including Arsenal and Manchester United, none of them were prepared to match his release clause.

'I would not say I was disappointed [to stay], but despite being very happy at Sporting, we all have ambitions and I hope one day to be playing in the best leagues in the world, the English or Spanish,' Carvalho told the official magazine of the Portuguese Football Federation.

'It did not happen this year, but if I continue to do my job as I have been doing for sure that sooner or later it will happen.

'I understand the proposals, but I think that there was no value for the clause and therefore they have been refused.'
