Texas authorities today confirmed that a three-year-old boy adopted from Russia was covered in bruises and unresponsive when he was brought into hospital last month, where he was later pronounced dead.

The news comes a day after Russia's Investigative Committee accused Little Max Shatto's adopted American mother of causing his tragic Jan. 21 death after she allegedly abused him and gave him psychiatric drugs.

An autopsy into Max's cause of death is 
pending but Ector County Medical Examiner's office today gave weight to the Kremlin's claims after it confirmed marks on the child's body that could have been caused by abuse.

Chief investigator Shirley Standefer said there were signs of bruising on Max's body, including in the lower abdominal area. However, she refused to comment on whether the bruises appeared to be intentional or accidental.

The State Department has meanwhile cautioned people not to jump to conclusions about the boy's cause of death and to instead wait until the investigation and autopsy have delivered their results.

Max's tragic death has received international attention in the wake of a recent Russian ban on all American adoptions.

Russia's Investigative Committee said that it had opened an 
investigation into the little boy's death.

'Three-year-old Maxim was beaten, 
according to the investigators, by his adoptive mother, who fed him 
psychoactive drugs over a long period of time, saying that he had some 
psychiatric illness,' said Pavel Astakhov, the Russian Children's Rights
Commissioner alleges, according to The Telegraph.

Tragedy: Max Shatto, 3, died last month after being adopted by a family in Texas. Russian authorities are claiming he was abused

Russian born: Maxim was born the town of Pskov, near Russia's western border with Estonia. The boy lived with a family in Gardendale, Texas with his family before his death

He said the toddler had numerous bruises on his body and damage to organs.

'Our consuls must be allowed to see the materials of the case and take part in the formulation of the prosecution,' he added.

Texas Child Protective Services spokesman Patrick Crimmins confirmed 
the agency had received a report on Jan. 21 of the death of a three-year-old
named Max Shatto, and that the Ector County Sheriff's Office in West 
Texas was investigating.

Crimmins said CPS had received allegations of physical abuse and 
neglect, but had not determined whether those allegations were true.

Parents: The boy's adopted parents, Alan and Laura Shatto, denied knowing about the allegations being made by Russian authorities. No arrests have been made

Sad: The little boy, pictured right, was pronounced dead in hospital on Jan. 21

Sgt. Gary Duesler, spokesman for the Ector County Sheriff's Office, said
no arrests have been made and authorities are waiting for autopsy 
results.

An obituary for Max Shatto published Jan. 26 by the Midland 
Reporter-Telegram says he was born on Jan. 9, 2010, in the town of 
Pskov, near Russia's western border with Estonia.

The boy lived with a 
family in Gardendale, about 350 miles west of Dallas, before his death 
on Jan. 21, according to the obituary.

When reached by telephone, Mr Shatto told the Telegraph: 'We're not aware of what any Russian envoy has said. We're not making any comment.'

On the funeral home's website,
Max's parents wrote: 'Max, you were not with us long enough to leave 
fingerprints on the walls but you left fingerprints upon our hearts.

Accusations: Pavel Astakho has alleged that Maxim was beaten to death by his American mother. American authorities have not confirmed the allegations are still investigating

'When we get to Heaven, we know we will hear your sweet voice singing with the angels. We love you and will always miss you.'

The death comes weeks after Russia announced it was banning all American
adoptions in retaliation for a new U.S. law targeting alleged Russian 
human-rights violators.

The ban also reflects lingering resentment over 
the 60,000 Russian children adopted by Americans in the past two 
decades, of which at least 19 have died.

Russian Foreign Ministry official Konstantin Dolgov said in a statement that the boy's death was 'yet another case of inhuman treatment of a Russian child adopted by American parents.'

Duesler said he could not immediately confirm or deny Russian allegations of abuse.

Dolgov also accused the U.S. Department of State of not helping Russian consular officials investigate the death.

Timing: Max's death comes weeks after Russian authorities announced it was banning all adoptions by Americans

A State Department official said the government is aware of the case and 'takes very seriously the welfare of children, particularly children who have been adopted from other countries.'

'We will continue to assist the Russian Embassy and consulate officials in making contact with the appropriate authorities in Texas,' said the State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak on the record about the matter.

Crimmins said the Russian consulate had contacted Child Protective Services.
