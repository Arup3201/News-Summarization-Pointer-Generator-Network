Intelligence officers warned Tony Blair that Iraq had no significant weapons of mass destruction a year before he took Britain to war, it emerged yesterday.

Secret evidence given to the Chilcot Inquiry into the conflict reveals the former Prime Minister was told in 2002 that Libya posed a far greater threat and was pursuing an active nuclear weapons programme.

By contrast, one senior MI6 officer said it was clear 12 months before the war that Saddam Hussein had no nuclear weapons and no significant WMD at all.

The unnamed officer said any actual WMD in Iraq would be ‘very, very small’ and would fit on ‘the back of a petrol lorry’.

Mr Blair is said to have ‘understood’ that Libya was the real threat.

On April 4, 2002, the day before Mr Blair flew to the United States for a pivotal weekend with George W Bush, he is said to have accepted that ‘it would not be sensible to lead the argument on Saddam and the WMD issue’.

In the run-up to the 2003 war, Mr Blair claimed the intelligence on Iraq’s WMD programme was ‘extensive, detailed and authoritative’.

But no weapons were ever found and the Chilcot Inquiry heard a great deal of testimony that raises doubts about what intelligence the West possessed on Saddam’s weapons.

One MI6 officer said the danger from WMD was ‘all in the cranium of just a few scientists, who we never did meet and we have been unable to meet ever since’.

The Chilcot Inquiry, whose report is more than a year late, also saw secret Government papers suggesting Mr Blair and President Bush made a pact to act against Iraq during their weekend at the President’s ranch in Texas.

Plaid Cymru MP Elfyn Llwyd said: ‘It was quite clear that the deal had been struck firmly that weekend and the wording was quite unambiguous. There’s no doubt in my mind that that weekend saw Blair decide to go to war.’

Mr Llwyd said the former Prime Minister ‘had his head turned’ and was ‘star-struck’ by Mr Bush.

The Chilcot Inquiry is expected to be highly critical of Mr Blair in its findings later this year.

‘This report will be absolutely damning on Blair’s style of government, the decision-making process and the planning and execution for its aftermath,’ an inquiry source told the Independent on Sunday.

Toby Dodge, of the International 
Institute for Strategic Studies, said: ‘I think they will rip into him 
for his style of government.

'It’s clear the way the intelligence was handled, filtered out and shaped was an issue. This is a perversion of the use of intelligence.’

Mr Blair has always denied misleading the public over WMD.

His spokesman said: ‘There have been five inquiries into this now. If people do want to see the intelligence reports, they are published online.

‘The view that Saddam Hussein had a WMD programme was held not just by the intelligence services in the UK and US but in countries which opposed military action.’
