Fourteen-month-old Elia-belle Hooker suffered a nasty cut to her face when she and her older brother Jack, two, were playing with a Disney tea set

A mother has urged Argos to rid their shelves of a 'dangerous' toy after her 14-month-old baby girl suffered a nasty cut from the rough plastic edges.

Horrified at the cut inflicted on tiny Elia-belle Hooker by the Disney Princess Tea Set, mother Natalie Giugno posted a warning on Facebook to alert other unsuspecting parents.

The 30-year-old immediately returned the toy to the Cromer branch of Argos urging managers to remove the product from sale.

But when an Argos representative revealed Miss Giugno's was the first complaint he advised they could not take the toy - which carries a warning that it is not suitable for children under the age of three - off the shelves.

Miss Giugno said the decision 'shocked and disgusted' her.

Argos has since said they have launched an urgent investigation with the toy's suppliers.

Determined to do something to ensure other children were not injured she posted a picture of Elia's cut along with the toy and warning on the social networking site.

Since it was posted more than 80,000 people around the world have shared the warning, with dozens messaging Miss Giugno to express their thanks.

The 30-year-old from Holt in Norfolk said Elia was playing with her older brother Jack when she heard her crying 'all of a sudden'.

She said while her youngest children were playing nicely together, pretending to have a tea party,  Jack must have banged into this little sister, accidentally causing the cut.

'I could not believe it, that a toy tea cup could cause such a nasty cut,' she told MailOnline.

'Jack is two years old, he doesn't have the strength to cause such a cut, they were playing so nicely together.

'I picked up the cup and felt the edges - they were really sharp, like unfinished plastic, almost grainy.'

Miss Giugno said when she returned the toy to her local branch the staff there were 'brilliant', fetching another model to check if the problem was replicated.

She said: 'The manager said they would send the toy off for hazardous analysis and that someone would contact me back.

Miss Giugno has called for Argos to remove the Disney Princess Tea Set from its shelves after her 14-month-old daughter Elia-belle suffered a nasty cut to her cheek when she was scratched by the rough plastic edge of one of the tea cups

'I am a regular customer of Argos and they are generally great. I really thought they would take the toy off the shelves.

'But
I didn't hear anything back for ages and so wrote a letter. Then the 
managing director's office contacted me to tell me they were looking 
into removing it from sale.

'But
when he called back the next day he said because ours was the only 
complaint they would not be removing the toy from the shelves but would 
monitor the situation.

'I
was horrified. I couldn't believe it. It could very easily have been 
Elia's eye, she could have been left with her vision impaired.'

The mother-of-four said she was disappointed when the store firstly offered her a £15 gift card in compensation and then upped their offer to £50.

'It is certainly not about getting any money from them,' she told MailOnline.

Jack, two, and his little sister Elia-belle were pretending to have a tea party when the accident happened. Little Elia-belle still has a faint scar underneath her right eye, where the tea cup cut her face

Rachel Hooker, mum to Polly (left) and auntie to Jack (centre) and Elia-belle (right) bought a set each for her daughter and nieces and nephews. She has joined Miss Giugno's calls for Argos to take the toy off the shelves

'I am worried this could happen to another child and this time the child might not be so lucky. Elia could have really hurt her eye, she could have caused real damage to her sight.

'There will be parents out there buying Christmas presents for their children unaware of the sharp edges.

'The scarring is still there, the next day we had to take her to the doctors because the cut got infected.

'Poor little thing, she only wanted to be a princess and play with the tea set.'

Argos said they have launched an urgent investigation with the suppliers of the Disney Princess Tea Set, pictured

Argos told MailOnline they have launched an urgent investigation with the toy's manufacturers.

A spokeswoman for the chain said: 'We are very sorry to learn of this 
child’s injury and we have made contact with Natalie Marie directly to 
discuss her complaint.

'We 
can confirm that we have no record of any other reported injuries with 
the Disney Princess Tea Set Playset. However, we have launched an urgent
internal investigation with the supplier.'

The toy was a present for Mrs Giugno's older daughter Maisie-Rose, six, bought by her sister-in-law Rachel Hooker.

The 27-year-old who lives nearby in Sherringham, Norfolk, also bought one of the sets for her 10-month-old daughter Polly.

She said: 'I felt absolutely terrible,' she added. 'Natalie called me to see if I had bought one for Polly.

'And
then she told me what had happened to Elia. She just wanted to let me 
know, she told me it wasn't my fault but I felt responsible.

'She
has still got a scar, it got infected. But it could have been so much 
worse, if it had been one centimeter higher it could have scratched her 
eye.

'I felt awful, I know it isn't my fault but I felt responsible.

'It could easily happen to another child and that is why we want to see the product taken off the shelves.

'Whether the toy is not suitable for children under the age of three, it should not have such sharp edges. Children over the age of three have younger siblings. It is not acceptable to leave unfinished plastic on the edges.

'The edges are really sharp, and because there are so many pieces in the set, they are on all the tea cups and plates.'

The MailOnline contacted Disney's press office for a comment but has yet to receive a response.

Miss Giugno discovered the sharp edges on a tea cup caused her daughter's injury. She said the pieces appear as though the plastic is unfinished

The 30-year-old posted this warning on her Facebook page: 'PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS TOY. Please can you all share this.

'My
daughter was playing with this tea set with her brother when my son 
playfully hit her in the face with a tea cup that had extremely sharp 
edging (small little sharp plastic bits sticking out of the cups).

'I took the toy back to Argos and the manager checked another one of the tea sets and found identical sharp edging.

'After
a month of Argos not responding, this week I have been in contact with 
the a rather un-sympathetic man from the managing directors office, they
were thinking about removing the product but a day later decided not 
to.

'Money is obviously more important than safety.

'To add insult to injury they even had the cheek to offer me a £15 good will gesture.

'My
little girl still has a scar and was treated for an infection because 
of all this and I don't want another child to suffer so I'm taking it 
further as I want this toy off the shelves.

'Support me by sharing.'
