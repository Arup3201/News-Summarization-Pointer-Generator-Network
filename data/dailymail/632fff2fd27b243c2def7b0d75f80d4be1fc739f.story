A psychic who claims to have sex with aliens who sneak into her room while she sleeps appeared on live TV to discuss the 'out-of-this-world orgasms' she has with 'octopus men and cat people'.

Stephany Fay Cohen discussed her adult adventures with Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield on today's This Morning, as part of a week of features celebrating the supernatural.

Cohen even drew pictures of both the UFO she travels in with her 'spirit guides', and a Grey, one race of alien with whom she interacts.

Before the show, Cohen had revealed to Philip that the sex she has with aliens resulted in 'out-of-this-world orgasms'.

Explaining her story, Cohen said that the aliens sneak into her room at night: 'My group, I call them Team Spirit, we have a UFO, a flying saucer, and we go off to planets within our own solar system but also way out. We go in mind. It happens when my physical body is asleep but my spiritual body travels.

Holly then asked: 'Could it be a dream? Isn't that what most people call dreaming?'

To which Cohen replied: 'A dream is a friendly way of letting you know what you've been doing without scaring you. That's what they are. Because otherwise people would be afraid if they were face-to-face with an alien.'

Cohen explained that the various types of alien races include the Greys, the reptilians, the cat people and the octopus men, all of whom come from different planets in the Canis Major solar system. She has a particularly close octopus man friend named Ian.

She said: 'He stays close to me, kind of like a 
spirit boyfriend - but I don't call him my boyfriend, he's more a good 
spirit friend who happens to be from the octopus race.

'All of the races indulge in sex, but particularly the cat people are highly-charged sexually - and it's part of our culture.'

Supernatural sceptic Professor Chris French appeared alongside Cohen on the programme to contradict her views. He said: 'The oldest question is whether 
there is any kind of external proof of this, and I'm not convinced. It's 
all happening in Stephany's head, basically, as she admits herself.'

Professor French suggested an alternative explanation was that Cohen suffers from Persistent Arousal Disorder, which makes her feel as though she is having sex while asleep.

When asked if the aliens were in the studio at present, Cohen explained they were, saying: 'My cat grandmother is sitting on the sofa over there doing her knitting.'

She elaborated that the aliens didn't appear to everyone because 'they're not into showing off and are quite reserved', and that each person has their own individual guides who manifest themselves to them only.

When Cohen was unable to use her alien guides to reveal what was in Philip Schofield's briefcase in his dressing room, she could not explain why.
