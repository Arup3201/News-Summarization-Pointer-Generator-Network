President Barack Obama is doing his part to support small businesses.

Obama and daughters Malia and Sasha dropped in Saturday at Washington's Politics and Prose bookstore and purchased what he said was a ‘long list’ of books that included The Kite Runner, Harold and the Purple Crayon, and The Sports Gene.

The president said he bought a reader for every age, from 5 to 52 - his age.

Shoppers and store employees were 
shocked to see the president drop by in his casual clothes with his two 
daughters. The president is seen laughing and talking to people in the 
shop as he makes his purchase.

Did we remember to get The Kite Runner? Obama, with daughters Sasha, center, and Malia, right, pays for his purchase after buying a 'long list' of books

He paid by credit card. The total was not announced.

Obama sent a tweet earlier Saturday about the importance of supporting small businesses.

The Saturday after Thanksgiving has become known as ‘Small Business Saturday’.

It's designed to drive business to mom and pop shops between the whirlwind of Black Friday sales offered by large retailers and Cyber Monday deals from online sellers.

Wait, how much did I pay you? Obama is seen making the girl behind the counter laugh as he takes what looks to be a business card from the store

As he left the shop, the President wished everyone a "great holiday," and customers applauded.

First lady Michelle 
Obama, who was not with the family Saturday, held a book signing at 
Politics and Prose in May to promote American Grown, a book about the 
White House garden and her campaign against obesity.

Last year, the Obamas shopped at a different bookstore - One More Page Books - in the Washington suburb of Arlington, Virginia.

In 2011, they went to Kramerbooks and Afterwords Café in Washington.
