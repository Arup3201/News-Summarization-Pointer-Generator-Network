Crohn's disease: Elizabeth Rose, 25, from Kent, launched legal action at the High Court today

A Crohn's disease sufferer is challenging what she claims is an ‘unlawful’ decision to refuse her funding for her eggs to be frozen before she undergoes chemotherapy.

The judicial review action brought by artist Elizabeth Rose, 25, from Margate, Kent, was ‘exceptionally urgent’, a judge at the High Court in Central London heard today.

Her barrister told Mr Justice Jay that Miss Rose, who was diagnosed with Crohn's disease at the age of 14, faces ‘imminent’ bone marrow transplantation and chemotherapy - treatment she fears will render her infertile.

One theory is that Crohn's is caused by the immune system attacking healthy bacteria in the gut. So by giving the patient a new immune system - through a bone marrow transplant - it is hoped that the disease can be cured.

To have a bone marrow transplant, stem cells are removed, high-dose chemotherapy is given to suppress the immune system - and stem cells are then returned.

Clinicians at King's College Hospital in South- East London applied on her behalf for funding so her eggs could be frozen before treatment.

But Jeremy Hyam, representing Miss Rose, said there was a ‘continuing refusal’ by Thanet Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) to provide NHS-funded fertility preservation treatment, with the most recent refusal being on March 19.

Miss Rose, who was present in court, launched the legal action in a bid to overturn the refusal and keep alive her hopes of one day having children. She believes she is the victim of a ‘postcode lottery’ as the treatment is available to single women in other parts of the country.

Miss Rose, a Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design fine art graduate, said she is determined that the rules should be changed ‘as this treatment is becoming more commonplace for Crohn's disease sufferers and I would not want any other woman to have to go through this ordeal’.

In written argument before the judge, Mr Hyam submits that the refusal to fund the fertility preservation treatment, which would cost £4,050, is unlawful ‘because it was and continues to be defended on the basis of a policy which is unlawful and out of date’.

He told the judge: ‘The expected consequence for her if the fertility preservation treatment is not provided is lifelong infertility and the inability to bear her own genetic child. Oocyte cryopreservation takes a few weeks to complete and therefore there is a short window of opportunity.’

Egg freezing is funded by the NHS if carried out for women having cancer treatment. After treatment, it costs £200 a year to pay for safe storage of the eggs.

It's claimed the chances of getting a baby from a frozen egg are about 1 to 3 per cent for each egg. Also, only eight out of ten eggs survive the thawing process.

Before extacting the eggs, fertility drugs are used to stimulate the ovaries to produce follicles (which contain the eggs).

The developing follicles are monitored and when they are large enough, they are carefully emptied to collect the eggs that they have produced. They are collected while the patient is under sedation or general anaesthetic.

To freeze the eggs, they are placed in storage in liquid nitrogen and the standard storage period for eggs is normally 10 years.

Up to December 2012, only 20 babies had been born in the UK after treatment using patients’ own frozen eggs (although more have been born from donor eggs).

The case is being contested by Thanet CCG, which submits that its refusal is lawful.

It has said in a statement: ‘All Kent and Medway CCGs have agreed a policy on assisted reproductive techniques, including in relation to the freezing of eggs.

‘The policy all Kent and Medway CCGs have adopted, after extensive consultation and clinical advice, is that this particular procedure will not normally be funded by the NHS in Kent and Medway on the basis that there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate effectiveness.

‘We are very sorry about the distress this may cause patients who are facing very difficult personal circumstances.

‘However, we must use our limited public money to fund services for our population as a whole and so are required to take difficult decisions on prioritising treatments.’

Merry Varney, from law firm Leigh Day, who is representing Miss Rose, said in a statement: ‘Whilst we and our client appreciate there are limited funds available, Nice (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) reviewed the clinical evidence and cost-effectiveness of this treatment and has recommended it should be offered.

‘Thanet CCG provide funding for fertility preservation for males and couples, also recommended by Nice on similar terms. It cannot be right to not fund this treatment for women like Lizzy.’

Crohn’s disease is a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system.

Inflammation can affect any part of the digestive system, from the mouth to the back passage, but most commonly occurs in the last section of the small intestine (ileum) or the large intestine (colon).

Symptoms include diarrhoea, abdominal pain, fatigue and weight loss and, in the long term, the inflammation can result in additional complications, such as narrowing of the colon.

It isn’t fully understood what causes the condition but genes, a faulty immune system and previous infection may play a role.

There is no cure but there are medications to help control symptoms. In up to 75 per cent of cases, surgery will be needed to repair damaged parts of the digestive system.

One theory is that Crohn's is caused by the immune system attacking healthy bacteria in the gut.

So by giving the patient a new immune system - through a bone marrow transplant - it is hoped that the disease can be cured.

To have a bone marrow transplant, stem cells are removed, high-dose chemotherapy is given to suppress the immune system - and stem cells are then returned.

There are currently at least 115,000 people living with Crohn’s disease in the UK.Crohn's disease can affect people of all ages, including children.

However, most cases first develop between the ages of 16 and 30.
