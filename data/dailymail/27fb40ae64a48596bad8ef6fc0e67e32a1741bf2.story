A previously unknown piano work written by Mozart aged about 11 was performed for the first time today

A previously unknown piano work written by Mozart 
as a child was performed for the first time today.

The piece formed part of a 160-page book of handwritten music found last year after apparently being left in an attic for centuries, according to the Mozarteum Salzburg Foundation, which 
staged the event.

The
lively 84-bar passage — marked 'allegro molto', or 'very quick' — was 
played on the Austrian composer's piano in a room of his Salzburg home, where he was born in 1756, by 
virtuoso Florian Birsak.

Part of a collection of notes from a 
village music teacher, the book was dated 1780 - 24 years after Mozart 
was born - and the manuscript bore the name 'Del Signore 
Giovane Wolfgango Mozart', Italian for 'Mr Wolfgang Mozart Jr'.

The music was found in a private house in Austria's Tyrol province by university lecturer Hildegard Herrmann-Schneider from the institute for Tyrolean music research at Innsbruck University.

He said the fact that other pieces 
in the book were known works by Mozart's father, Leopold, strengthened 
the case that the work was genuine.

He added that Leopold often used 'Wolfgango' when labelling works written by his young son.

From the style of the composition, Hermann-Schneider attributed it to Mozart at around the age of 11.

The
piece exhibits 'a series of components that are found repeatedly in 
other Mozart piano works,' said the foundation in a statement.

It added: 'Judging 
by the current level of knowledge, it thus has to be a genuine sonata 
phrase from Mozart.'

Hermann-Schneider encountered the music when gathering handwritten pieces for the Répertoire International des Sources Musicales, an international organisation which catalogues music sources preserved around the world.

The piece was handed over to a professional music copyist in Tyrol who identified the writing and confirmed it was produced by the composer while still a youngster.

Although Mozart died more than 200 years
ago, he was such a prolific writer that unknown works are still 
occasionally being discovered.

The sonata is the third previously unknown work by Mozart to be found in six years.

The other discoveries were in 2006 and 2010 of the so-called Nannerl-music books.

Leopold is thought to have written music in the books for his daughter Maria Ann, known as Nannerl, and later put in some compositions of his young son.

The Mozart Foundation in Salzburg identified these extra works as also coming from the musician.
