Germany has branded France ‘Europe’s biggest problem child’ in the escalating war of words between the two countries.

The tit-for-tat name-calling comes as relations between Chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Francois Hollande continue to deteriorate.

Earlier this week a leaked French policy document described Mrs Merkel as ‘egotistical’ and said France’s socialist government – which opposes austerity – should engage in ‘democratic confrontation’ with her.

The language was later toned down, but Mr Hollande was accused of using the sort of rhetoric that led the two countries to war.

The blistering report also estimated that France had a bleak financial outlook, as it had failed to fully invest in research and development.

The continent's two biggest powers initially fell out when France's Socialist party called for 'democratic confrontation' with Germany, the Daily Telegraph reported.

It also attacked German Chancellor Angela Merkel, accusing her of 'egotistical intransigence'.

Those criticisms were leaked to the French media last week, accusing Mrs Merkel of thinking about 'nothing except the savings of account holders on the other side of the Rhine, Berlin's trade balance and her electoral future'.

Gemran politicians rallied around the chancellor, highlighting just how tense relations are between the two powers.

The row comes after Mrs Merkel, the 
continent’s most powerful leader, insisted countries would be forced to 
cede more sovereignty to rescue the troubled euro.

Last week she warned that eurozone members had to be prepared to surrender authority to European institutions.

Berlin is pushing for centralised controls of national budgets, and suggests that the EU's economics commissioner should be given more powers to police countries' economic policy decisions.

Germany and other rich countries want more oversight and control of the budgetary decisions of poorer nations which they are having to bail out to keep the single currency together.

Mrs Merkel also insists austerity and proper budgetary controls are critical to Europe’s economic future – a position which exacerbates her increasing conflict with Mr Hollande.

The socialist leader is facing rows not only with his foreign counterparts, but his own people too,.

He has become the most unpopular president in five decades, a new poll has revealed.

Hiss personal approval rating has plunged to just 25 per cent of the population amid soaring unemployment and ballooning public debt.

He is even more unpopular that President Charles de Gaulle was in 1968 - when millions of French rioted to demand a complete overhaul of French society.
