A touching photograph shared in time for Father's Day has revealed the incredible bond between a Utah dad and his disabled son.

The image, which was released by the U.S. Department of the Interior, shows James Geier, from Logan, pulling his quadriplegic son Jonah through the Arches National Park in Utah on a stroller.

The eighteen-year-old, who has cerebral palsy, adores being outside, so his 60-year-old dad has made it possible for him to see the nation's most breathtaking sights since he was born.

Mr Geier, a retired law enforcement officer, hiked 
three miles pulling Jonah nearly 500 feet over rock
 trails and up steps so that his son could experience the best views at Arches National Park.

'We
 just have a special relationship with Jonah, my wife and I,' the proud dad told Today. 'He's really
 kind of a best friend as well as our son. He's probably the best 
company that you can have.'

The photograph was taken by his daughter, Laura, two years ago but warmed hearts this weekend when it was shared by the Department of Interior on their Instagram page.

Since then, it has been 'liked' more than 10,000 times and has garnered more than 200 comments calling the image 'pure love' and 'so touching'.

Laura originally submitted the photograph to the annual 'Share the Experience' photo contest, but the department decided to share it again this past weekend.

'We thought this is such a great photo for Fatherâ€™s Day - it just kind of shows what Father's Day is all about,' Time Fullerton, the director of digital strategy, told Today.

The Geier family, who have been hiking since their children were young, have visited Capitol Reef National Park and returned to Arches since the photograph was taken.

'He enjoys it completely,' Mr Geier said of Jonah.

Mr Geier used to carry Jonah in a child carrier 
but when he started to weigh more 
than 70 pounds, he found the Dixon Roller pack, which was
modified with a webbed sling seat for Jonah.

'Pure love': More than 10,000 people have liked the photograph on the department's Instagram page

He said the
 visit to Arches was the first time he tried out the system and he had 
no trouble pulling his excited teen through the breathtaking landscape.

When Laura initially submitted the photograph, she said that 'neither Geier nor Arch is deterred by challenges'.

'Perseverance,' she wrote. 'Shared by both the Arch in withstanding time and change, and the resolve of a father to hike his disabled son to the Arch to experience the incredible symbol of natural beauty and strength.'
