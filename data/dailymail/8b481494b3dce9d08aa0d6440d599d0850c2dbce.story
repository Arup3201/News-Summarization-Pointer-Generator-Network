A hiker has described the terrifying moment that he believed he would die alone at the bottom of an icy crevasse after plummeting 40 feet into a glacier and breaking his back.

Ted Porter, 36, plunged 40-feet after losing his grip and sliding down a glacier on a solo hike in Montana's Glacier National Park last month.

Mr Porter, from Los Angeles, was forced to record a message on his phone which he believed would be his last words to his parents.

'Mom and Dad, I fell in a crevasse,' he says breathlessly before wailing in pain. 'You guys if I don't make it out, I love you. I'm not kidding. This is no joke.'

After recording the heartbreaking message, Mr Porter made the decision that he was not going to die alone in the wilderness.

He told ABC: 'After I said that, I just had this urge. I was not going to die down there.'

Despite having broken several vertebrae in his back, Mr Porter found the strength to claw his way out of the crevasse before trudging four miles in terrible pain to find help.

He came across campers who cared for him through the night until he could be rescued by helicopter.

Mr Porter, a voice-over artist from 
LA, is an experienced climber and decided to set out alone on September 3
during a week-long trip with his parents.

He
was hiking across one of the park's largest glaciers when he realized 
that he was in deep trouble as it began to rain and the ground 
conditions grew slippery.

He failed to put on his crampons and ice sacks, a grievous error which almost cost him his life.

He began to slide down the glacier and with horror noticed that a huge crevasse was opening up below. He plunged into the hole and landed deep below in the darkness.

The 36-year-old pulled himself up the 40-foot drop using crampons and an ice axe.

Mr Porter was emotional today when he thanked the campers who had helped him survive the night.

However he brushed off his own bravery, saying: '...I just crawled out of a crevasse. It's not a big deal.'

He has since had three surgeries and is currently undergoing rehabilitation while recovering with his family and girlfriend in California. Doctors say he came within millimeters of being paralyzed.

A fund has been set up to help pay for his medical bills here.
