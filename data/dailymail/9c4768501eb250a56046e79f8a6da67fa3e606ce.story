Brigadier Rupert Jones, son of Falklands hero Colonel 'H' Jones, will take command of Britain's 9,000 troops in Afghanistan

THE son of Falklands war hero Colonel ‘H’ Jones is to take command of Britain’s 9,000 troops in Afghanistan.

Brigadier Rupert Jones was 13 when his father died during a one-man charge on an Argentine trench in the Battle of Goose Green in 1982, for which he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.

Now 42, he will be in charge of 1 Mechanized Brigade when he arrives in Helmand province in April.

The job comes at a difficult time as Taliban insurgents are expected to intensify attacks on British forces who are preparing to leave the country by the end of 2014.

The enduring reputation of his father will increase scrutiny of Brigadier Jones’s handling of the dangerous region.

But he has said previously: ‘I have always said if I wanted to avoid  the connection I should have become a bank manager.’

Colonel Jones was also 42 when he was cut down by enemy fire while commanding 2 Battalion, The Parachute Regiment.

His valour helped inspire his troops to victory in the offensive on the Argentine stronghold.His son joined the Army eight years later but he has insisted he always knew he was going to sign up.

‘I was shaped by my father while he was alive.

‘I was always going to join the Army and I don’t even remember making the decision to join – it  was always going to happen,’ he once said.

He trained at the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst before serving with his father’s former regiment, the Devonshire and Dorsets.

It was merged to form part of the Rifles in 2007 and Jones was given command of the 4th battalion.

Colonel Richard Kemp, a former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, said Brigadier Jones – who was appointed an MBE in the Queen’s Birthday Honours in 2001 – had a tough job to do but was considered a ‘rising star’.

‘The Taliban will make real hay  to try to say they have defeated  the British and driven them out,  so they will be increasing their attacks,’ he said.

‘The focus of these attacks will be on coalition troops, not Afghan troops. Brigadier Jones and his troops will have a fight on their hands. He is a rising star of the Army. He is a chip off the old block and is a very effective combat commander.’

Military insiders said that Brigadier Jones commanded loyalty  with his combination of ‘exemplary’ military skills and ‘compassionate’ nature.

In February 2010 he launched  the Care for Casualties appeal on behalf of the Rifles.

At the time, he said: ‘This week  I will bury three of my riflemen – men too young to die.

‘Only yesterday I sat with one of my young riflemen who lost both legs and an arm. His focus is not on what he has lost but what he has.’  Marion Keogh met Jones when  her son Tom’s body was brought back to Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire, after he was killed in Afghanistan in 2010.

She described him as ‘eloquent and very nice’, adding: ‘He was a really charming, humane man.

‘I appreciate he took time to speak to us at Tom’s funeral and he was very kind.’

Colonel ‘H’ Jones’s elder son, David, also joined the Army but later became a businessman. His widow, Sara, 71, was appointed a CBE for her services to forces charities. Last night she said: ‘One is proud of one’s son.’

She declined to comment further except to say Rupert ‘just wants to get on with his job’.
