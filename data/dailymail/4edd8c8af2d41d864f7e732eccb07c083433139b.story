American powerhouse Serena Williams suffered from an on-court health scare which forced her to retire from practice on Friday after only ten minutes of play.

Ahead of her Australian open final against Russia's Maria Sharapova, Williams was hunched over in pain after a rigorous start to her workout.

Williams has been plagued by health problems over the past year, appearing to be under the weather in interviews leading up to her semi-final match, and said that she was afraid she had caught a virus.

Williams, 33, was comforted on court at Melbourne Park by her coach and boyfriend Patrick Mouratoglou, who has been assisting the world number one since 2012.

'I've felt better, but I'm feeling OK. I'm just happy to still be in the tournament', said Williams.

'I've been sick the past few days. It's just getting worse and worse. But hopefully it will start getting better. I heard it's a virus going around with a lot of the players. I think I caught it,' reported The Sydney Morning Herald.

The 18-time major winner pulled out of a match during Wimbledon last year, crying on court after falling prey to a virus.
