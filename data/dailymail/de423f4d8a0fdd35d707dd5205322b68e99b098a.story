As Sportsmail’s exclusive pictures show, the blaze was so intense that it melted the bath, destroying the bathroom and leaving adjoining rooms ruined by smoke damage.

The incident, on October 23, 2011, came the night before his famous 'Why Always Me' T-shirt celebration after scoring the second of his two against Manchester United in City's famous 6-1 win at Old Trafford.

A City spokesman at the time said: 'We can confirm there was an incident at Mario’s house which the fire brigade attended.

'Nobody was injured and Mario trained as normal with the rest of the squad on Saturday morning.'

Balotelli has been the subject of controversy since being in English football, playing for Manchester City before being sold back to AC Milan.

In April 2011, it was reported Balotelli had spent £10,000 in parking fines and had his sports car impounded 27 times.

He once crashed his sports car soon after arriving and it was reported that police found £5,000 in cash in his back pocket.

The striker was also reprimanded for throwing darts at the training ground.

Balotelli, now a Liverpool player following his departure from City and short spell with AC Milan, has struggled since re-joining the Premier League and is yet to score in the competition for his new club.

Pressure has been increasing on the £16m summer signing after a series of frustrating performances. he has netted twice for Brendan Rodgers' side - once in the Champions League against Ludogorets, the other in the League Cup against Swansea.
