Given the scenes witnessed at the world’s largest train station this morning, anyone would have thought these people were on an emotional pilgrimage somewhere. Well, some certainly were.

Apple’s new 23,000 sq ft flagship store at Grand Central in Manhattan, New York, opened to great fanfare today as staff cheered enthusiasts who queued up for hours to be the first customers inside.

Some fanatics had travelled almost 3,000 miles to make it and were rewarded as the first 4,000 people through the door received an exclusive t-shirt that reads: ‘Apple Store, Grand Central’.

Crowds: Apple's new flagship store at Grand Central in Manhattan, New York, opened to great fanfare today as staff cheered enthusiasts who queued up for hours to be the first customers inside

Hurrah! Apple employees enthusiastically greet customers arriving to shop for Apple products on the opening day of the new Apple store at Grand Central Station in New York on Friday

People are already bidding for one on Ebay - but Jacob Davis is unlikely to give away his anytime soon. The 19-year-old travelled 150 miles from Albany, New York, to get to the front of the queue.

‘He’s my son and he’s an Apple fanatic,’ his father Robert, who had joined him waiting for more than 24 hours, told WCBS. ‘He loves the machines and he even gave me one for Father’s Day.’

But Mr Davis did not make the longest trip. Second in line was Gary Allen, who flew an astonishing 2,900 miles from Berkeley, California, and has visited Apple stores around the world, reported CNET.

IT consultant Hector Nieves, who works near Grand Central, said he was moved by the cheering crowd as the store opened and thought of the late Apple founder Steve Jobs, who died in October.

‘I could barely hold back my emotions coming up the stairs,’ Mr Nieves told CNET. The store has two ‘Genius Bars’ for technological help, 315 staff employed and a personal collection area for pick-ups.

The store opened at 10am on Friday morning and by 11am there were 1,000 people who had made it inside, with another 500 queued up. Around 4,000 had got in by 12:30, reported CNN.

The owner of the space, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the city's bus and subway system, says Apple is paying $180 per square foot for its lease.

This is slightly less than the $200-per-square-foot top rate at the century-old transport hub.

By leasing to Apple, the MTA says it is quadrupling the rent for Grand Central's east balcony and an adjacent one overlooking the cavernous main concourse with its famed night-sky ceiling.

The store includes a basement storage area that was never leased before. The transit agency says the draw of the Apple name promises to increase foot traffic to other businesses at the terminal.

Apple is behind iconic products such as the iPod, the iPad and the iPhone - and has set up in a station that is visited by about 750,000 people daily and home to the Metro-North commuter line.

The company signed a 10-year lease with the MTA for the space once occupied by Charlie Palmer's Metrazur restaurant, which got $5million from Apple to clear out early.

All new: The store features two Genius Bars, 15-minute Express Workshop for commuters on a tighter schedule and will employ 315 people

MTA says the $180-per-square-foot cost reflects this $5million payment, plus Apple's $2.5million capital investment in the space and a $1.1million annual rate that will rise each year of the lease.

Apple is making it easier than ever to spend money at the new store in Grand Central.

Visitors to the station can buy personal electronics without the help of a human being. 

They slide an iPhone across a product's bar code and grab the item. The receipt is emailed.

'It's all about putting the customer in charge,' an Apple spokesman said confidently.

The store also offers one feature not available at any other Apple store - 15-minute training sessions for rushed New Yorkers.

Apple will not share any portion of its revenue with the MTA, as other retailers do at the terminal, and it is considered by the transport group as an ‘anchor tenant’ at Grand Central.

This is equivalent to a prominent store in a shopping centre that serves as an attraction surrounded by smaller retailers. An anchor tenant typically does not share revenue.

The spotlight on the latest Apple store accompanies the intense public profile of the company, based in Cupertino, California, following the death in October of its celebrity founder, Mr Jobs.

This Apple store, the fifth to open in New York City, is about the size of two that are in London. Grand Central Terminal is the world's biggest train station by number of platforms.

Company representatives offered a media preview of the new store on Wednesday, demonstrating its key features. Apple announced the opening of the store on its retail website.
