The deaths of two state troopers who were shot in a remote Alaska community on Thursday have highlighted the dangers the force faces as it patrols remote and difficult terrain.

'This will take us a long time to heal,' Colonel James Cockrell said on Friday, as 19-year-old Nathaniel Lee Kangas was arrested in connection with the shooting.

Trooper Gabriel 'Gabe' Rich, 26, and Sergeant Patrick 'Scott' Johnson, 45, were killed in the isolated community of Tanana, which has no roads and a population of only 238.

'Currently department members are dealing with shock and disbelief trying to make sense of Sergeant Johnson and Trooper Rich's deaths,' Cockrell told KTUU.

Like many troopers assigned to patrol multiple villages, Rich and Johnson worked from a rural service base about 130 miles from Tanana, which they reached by plane.

The men and their rugged patrol route had featured on a National Geographic reality show, Alaska State Troopers.

No formal charges have been brought against Kangas yet, but police believe he used a semi-automatic rifle to kill the two troopers.

His 58-year-old father, Arvin Kangas, has also been arrested, and is facing charges of assault over a confrontation on Wednesday with Mark Haglin, the village's unarmed public safety officer.

The elder Kangas was said to have been angry about a sofa sale, Cockrell said. At one point, Arvin Kangas pointed a shotgun at Haglin as the public safety officer drove by the suspect's house, troopers said.

Village public safety officers are unarmed, but a bill passed by lawmakers this year would allow for the arming of the officers, who serve as first responders in rural communities that can be located hours or days - depending on the weather - from the nearest state trooper.

Reached by telephone, Haglin referred questions to troopers.

Only sketchy details have been released about what transpired before the shootings in the community, where residents live a traditional Athabascan lifestyle, including hunting and fishing for their food.

Tanana resident Ruby Cruger is related to the Kangas family, but said she did not know the details of the shooting, just that it has affected the entire community.

'They're all shocked,' Cruger said of the town's reaction to the shooting.

The troopers arrived in Tanana at about 2.45pm on Thursday to serve an arrest warrant on the elder Kangas. Cockrell said the troopers soon encountered the elder Kangas just outside the front door of his home.

They were trying to place him under arrest when a struggle erupted, and the three men went inside through the door, where the younger Kangas shot the officers at about 3pm, according to troopers.

Shortly after, the village officer notified troopers, saying one of the officers was dead and the other one possibly also.

It is not clear what role the village officer played at the scene, although he was in the vicinity when the shootings occurred, Cockrell said.

Nathanial Kangas was arrested soon after. His father ran to another home and surrendered late Thursday night, according to troopers. Both are in custody in Fairbanks.

Rich and Johnson were occasionally featured on the National Geographic Channel show Alaska State Troopers, which features multiple troopers patrolling the state's wild terrain.

The troopers were not filming at the time of their deaths. Filming in the fifth season is currently being done with other troopers.

National Geographic said in a statement that it was 'incredibly saddened' to learn of the deaths.

Spokesman Chris Albert said the troopers are among the many who are subjected to the daily challenges of working in isolated areas of the state, such as Tanana.

Johnson was born in Fairbanks and grew up in the Alaska community of Tok. He was a veteran trooper who joined the force in 1993.

He spent his career in Fairbanks and worked a variety of roles, including patrol trooper, field training officer and as a canine officer, instructor and canine unit supervisor.

The husband and father of three daughters also had worked as a supervisor of a Fairbanks-area narcotics team.

Rich was born in Sayre, Pennsylvania, and grew up in Fairbanks. He first worked as a patrolman with the North Pole Police Department southeast of Fairbanks before deciding to join the troopers in 2011.

With the troopers, he spent most of his career on patrol. Survivors include his fiance, their one-year-old son and his fiance's eight-year-old son.

At the time of his death, Rich was in the process of adopting the older boy, troopers said.

Johnson and Rich joined the interior rural unit on January 1. The unit covers 23 villages scattered across a sparse terrain.

Their deaths came the same day the name of Manokotak village public safety Officer Thomas Madole was added to the Indian Country Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Artesia, New Mexico.

Madole was shot and killed March 19, 2013, while responding to a domestic violence call in the Alaska Native village.

Before Thursday, 64 law enforcement officers had been killed in the line of duty since 1897 in Alaska, according to information previously provided by the Alaska State Troopers.

Police memorials in Fairbanks, Anchorage and Juneau are being planned to pay tribute to the slain troopers.

Gov. Sean Parnell said in a statement that he and his wife, Sandy, 'were deeply saddened to learn of the senseless, brutal crime that took the lives of two of Alaska's finest.

'These fallen heroes answered the call to serve and protect, and made the ultimate sacrifice, while keeping our communities safe.'
