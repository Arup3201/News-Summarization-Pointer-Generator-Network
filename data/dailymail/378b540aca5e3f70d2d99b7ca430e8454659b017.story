Sky Sports have retained their stranglehold on the Premier League’s live TV rights as part of a staggering £5.136billion deal.

The seven packages on offer for the three seasons, starting from 2016-17, went to Sky and BT Sport in what is a 70 per cent increase in value on the current three-year deal for the world’s richest league.

Sky are buying 126 games per season — the maximum allowed — for £4.2bn, an 83 per cent rise on their present agreement. In contrast, BT Sport have paid £960m for 42 games per campaign — a 30 per cent increase in the cost of their current 38-game set of rights.

But while BT Sport are paying £7.6m a game for their two packages of Saturday afternoon games and midweek matches, Sky have had to fork out £11.1m-a-match for their five sets of matches. They take in Friday nights, Saturday lunchtimes, two slots on Sunday and Monday evening, plus Bank Holidays.

Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said: ‘I am constantly surprised by the numbers of our TV deals. The little ol’ Premier League is doing quite well.’

A Sky spokesman said: ‘The company will work hard to minimise the impact of higher rights costs on our customers.’

Just nine months ago, Richard Scudamore’s position was threatened by the furore aroused by his sexist email exchange and the prospect of serious heart surgery.

Now, the Premier League’s chief executive is basking in the personal triumph represented by the £5bn TV rights deal he has just delivered.

With the overseas rights to come, the Premier League will collect more than £8bn for their TV properties for the three seasons starting in 2016. That will see even the bottom club in the richest league in the world looking forward to £99million a season, while the champions will bank £156m.

And with each televised game bringing in £10m in rights, the Premier League’s first £500,000-a-week footballer can’t be far away.

The haul for the seven packages of 168 live games per season was a 70 per cent increase on the current deal. That was way beyond the most optimistic expectation of any of the top flight clubs, especially as the highlights deal had gone for just a modest 13.5 per cent increase to BBC.

Sportsmail had predicted a £5bn return but that was in the expectation that America’s Discovery Channel and Qatar’s BeIn Sport would be fully involved. The strict confidentiality covering the process means it is still not clear whether either network put an offer on the table, though probably neither did.

But in two rounds of bidding, Scudamore and his team of TV strategist David Kogan, lawyer Nick West and Premier League broadcasting chief Paul Molnar were still able to extract £5.136bn from Sky and BT Sport.

The price was driven by Sky’s frantic desire to retain their rights at any cost while not losing out to their arch pay-TV rivals.

Sky have paid £4.2bn over three years for 126 games a season spread over Friday nights, Saturday lunchtime, Sunday afternoons, Monday nights and bank holidays. They get 10 more games a season than under the current deal but will be paying 83 per cent more.

The £2bn increase will inevitably lead to higher subscription costs. While Sky will pay £11.1m a game, BT are paying a more realistic £7.6m for each of their 42 live matches per season.

Scudamore said: These are huge companies doing huge things and we are the beneficiaries.

Seven packages were available in the auction, five with 28 games per season and two with 14 games per season.

THE PACKAGES SKY WON 

Package A comprises 28 games on Saturday lunchtimes (12.30pm).

Package C has 28 games kicking off between 1.30pm and 2.15pm on Sundays. Pack A has 6 'first pick' games from 38 rounds and B has 9 first picks.

Package D is the 4pm Sunday bundle of 28 games - crucially with 18 'first pick' games.

Package E is the 'Monday night football' (8pm) bundle, with 18 games on Mondays plus 10 on Fridays; this is the first time Premier League games will be shown live on Friday evenings. There are no first picks in this package.

Package G is a bundle of 14 games on Bank Holidays and other Sunday matches with two first picks.

THE PACKAGES BT SPORT WON 

Package B has 28 games at tea-time on Saturdays (5.30pm)

Packages F has 14 games, a mix of midweek and Saturday games including three first picks.

Under the current ongoing deals Sky have paid £2.28bn over three years from 2013-16 for 116 games per season, or in other words, get 348 games at £6,551,724 each.

BT have paid £738m over three years from 2013-16 for 38 games per season, or in other words, get 114 games at £6,473,684 each.

50 per cent of the revenue is divided equally between the clubs

25 per cent is awarded on a merit basis, determined by final league positions

25 per cent is distributed as a facilities fee for televised matches

NICK HARRIS 

‘The Premier League is a success story. It is a great UK export. The Premier League, the BBC, the Queen — these are things that make people feel good about the UK.’

Sky chief executive Jeremy Darroch said: ‘This confirms that Sky is the unrivalled choice for sports fans. We went into the Premier League auction with a clear objective and are pleased to secure the rights that we wanted.’ 

BT say they are also happy with their increase in games — up from 38 to 42 — though they failed to break Sky’s stranglehold on the main packages and first picks.

Virgin Media made a fanciful attempt to delay the auction until their complaint about the bidding process is fully investigated by Ofcom. Chief executive Tom Mockridge said: ‘The auction is a license to print money for the Premier League. There are better ways to structure the auction.’

There are 20 unbelievably rich Premier league clubs who will certainly disagree.
