Anyone with kids tends to get a bit angry when a motorist is speeding through their neighborhood, and in some cases will take matters into their own hands in efforts to get the motorist to slow down.

However, in most cases the speedster isn't driving a car that costs nearly a half-a-million dollars - and the method used to get the driver to slow down isn't to pelt the speeding vehicle with a rock.

That, however, is exactly what happened to the driver of a Lamborghini Aventador in Playa Vista, California, who was driving a bit too fast for a bystander in what apparently is a residential area.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Slow down: The pedestrian warns the driver of the $400,000 sports car to slow down before he pelted the vehicle with a rock

Speed demon: The driver was revving the car's 6.5-cylinder engine while zipping through a residential area

In a Youtube video that achieved viral status this week, the driver of the Lamborghini - which starts in price at about $400,000 - is revving the car's 6.5-liter engine as the sports car zips through a suburban street.

Enter what appears to be an older pedestrian, who apparently was not as impressed with the Lambo's 700 horsepower as the driver of the car.

'Keep racing,' the man taunts the driver as the vehicle came to a stop where the pedestrian was standing. 'Keep doing it.'

When the Lamborghini tries to speed past him, the angry pedestrian hurls a rock at the side of the car, which appears to have done some significant damage based on the cracking 'thump' heard on the video.

Mystery: Neither the driver of the Lamborghini or the rock-hurling pedestrian have been identified, even as the video has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times

Getaway: After throwing the rock at the Lamborghini, the driver took off as the angry pedestrian chased after him

The identity of the driver and the pedestrian is unknown - and attempts to get in touch with the man who posted the video to Youtube were unsuccessful.Â 

Finding the driver of the vehicle might be a little easier than tracking down the man who threw the rock - since Lamborghini started making the Aventador in 2011, only about 2,500 of these 'supercars' have been produced.

For the driver's sake, hopefully the vehicle's exterior isn't as expensive to fix as the car's price tag might suggest.
