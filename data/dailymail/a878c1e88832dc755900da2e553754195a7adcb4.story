Jubilant scenes are being witnessed this morning at the Occupy Wall Street protest camp after a planned ‘eviction’ was postponed following a last-minute change of mind by the park’s owners.

Brookfield Office Properties put off a clean-up and supporters of the protesters streamed into the New York park in the morning darkness today, forming a crowd of several hundred chanting people.

Chanting 'Hell no! We won't go!', hundreds of demonstrators stormed a Wall Street restaurant last night to confront New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg over a planned clean-up of their camp.

Divisive: Demonstrators had said they would not be going anywhere on Friday morning when Zuccotti Park is schedule to be cleaned, setting the stage for a showdown with police

Protesters last night surrounded Cipriani 
restaurant in Manhattan as the Mayor was at dinner in an effort to hand
 him a petition with 310,000 signatures supporting their right to remain
 in Zuccotti Park.

Their anger was triggered by the Mayor's endorsement of a planned clean-up of the 'unsanitary' Occupy 
Wall Street encampment which was postponed at the last minute today.

The city's deputy mayor made the announcement after protesters, who viewed the clean-up as an 'eviction notice', streamed into the plaza this morning.

There was a strong police presence, and a showdown between protesters and authorities had been feared.

Hours earlier, the mayor had refused to leave the restaurant, instead making his exit out of a back door.

No showdown tonight: New York Mayor City Michael Bloomberg did not come out of the restaurant to address protesters, instead leaving out of a back door

There was a strong police presence, and a showdown between protesters and authorities had been feared.

Hours earlier, the mayor had refused to leave the restaurant, instead making his exit out of a back door.

New York City officials have ordered Wall Street protesters to clear their sleeping bags and tarps 
from the park where they started a movement that has spread around the 
globe and forced CEOs and presidential candidates to take notice.

But demonstrators said they wouldn't be going anywhere, setting the stage for a dawn showdown with police.

The
 owner of the private park where the demonstrators have camped out for 
nearly a month said it has become trashed and 'unsanitary'. Brookfield 
Office Properties had planned to begin a section-by-section power-washing of
 Zuccotti Park at 7am.

Rebellion: The march came one day after Bloomberg informed protesters that they would have to leave the park so that it could be 'cleaned'

Support: The protesters attempted to deliver to Bloomberg a petition with 310,000 signatures supporting the Occupy Wall Street protest and their right to stay in the park

Occupy
 Wall Street spokesman Patrick Bruner sent an email to supporters on
Thursday asking them to join the protesters at 6am Friday to 'defend the
 occupation from eviction', wary that the clean-up effort is a dirty trick to end their demonstrations.

He said Brookfield Properties, the 
owner of the park, asked for police assistance to clear it of protesters
 so that it could be cleaned.

Deputy Mayor Cas Holloway said in a 
statement Wednesday that the protest has 'created unsanitary conditions 
and considerable wear and tear on' Zuccotti Park.

The cleaning was to be done in stages, and protesters were permitted to return to the park after cleaners were finished.

Call to action: The mayor refused to come out of the posh restaurant to meet them and, instead, slipped out the back door

Police presence: The NYPD came out in large numbers as hundreds of demonstrators stormed the streets

However, NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly told the New
 York Post on Thursday that returning protesters will be prohibited from 
bringing tents, sleeping bags with them.

He said the demonstrators were notified of the new policy through pamphlets that were passed out to them by police officers.

The notice lists regulations including no tents, no tarps or sleeping bags on the ground, no lying on benches and no storage of personal property on the ground.

All those practices have been common at the park, where protesters have lived, slept and eaten for nearly a month.

Mayor Bloomberg visited the protesters Wednesday to offer assurances - but he didn’t stay long.

Clean-up: Protesters at Zuccotti Park were given a letter that the park needs to be cleaned on Friday

Luke Richardson, a 25-year-old protester, told the New York Daily News: 'I think we did the right thing - we booed him out of here.'

Tyler Combelic, a member of the press relations work group for Occupy Wall Street, told CNN: 'I'm glad that [Bloomberg] finally found what we were doing important enough to visit after dismissing it for several weeks.'

Mr Combelic added: 'I'm hoping that the city will be willing to work with the Occupy Wall Street occupiers in arranging a way to get the cleaning done, which both does not disturb the encampment nor does it too greatly impede on the cleaning process.'

But Allison Esso of Human Services Council, a group that supports the protesters, was wary.

She said: 'I'm hoping that they're not trying to undermine their ability to protest.'

The protest, known as Occupy Wall Street, has sympathetic groups in other cities which each stage their own local rallies and demonstrations: Occupy Boston, Occupy Cincinnati, Occupy Houston, Occupy Los Angeles, Occupy Philadelphia, Occupy Providence, Occupy Salt Lake, and Occupy Seattle, among them.

The movement is even spreading across the pond.

UK protesters inspired by Occupy Wall 
Street in the U.S are planning to establish a tent city in London's 
financial district this weekend.

A Facebook page titled 'Occupy London's Stock Exchange' has amassed more than 3,000 people agreeing to attend the event on October 15.

The group, who were behind a protest that saw Westminster Bridge closed on Monday posted on the social networking site that they are 'part of a global popular movement.'

A post under the name 'Occupy The London Stock Exchange' said: 'Hundreds attended the General Assembly and we are growing stronger every day!

The movement has also drawn reaction from world leaders, including President Obama, former Polish President Lech Walesa and Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Walesa said Thursday that he supports the New York protest and is planning to either visit or write a letter to the protesters.

He said the global economic crisis has made people aware that 'we need to change the capitalist system' because we need 'more justice, more people's interests, and less money for money's sake.'

Khamenei said Wednesday that the wave of protests reflects a serious problem that will ultimately topple capitalism in America.

Suspicious: Some Wall Street protesters are hoping that the clean-up is not an attempt to undermine their efforts

He claimed the United States is in a full-blown crisis because its 'corrupt foundation has been exposed to the American people.'

Khamenei's remarks came a day after U.S. officials said the Obama administration plans to leverage charges that Iran plotted to assassinate Saudi Arabia's ambassador into a new global campaign to isolate the Islamic republic.

Protesters, who have been living, sleeping and eating in the park for the duration, say they are in it for the long haul, despite the onset of cold weather.

On Wednesday, police arrested four people outside JP Morgan Chase offices where Wall Street protesters called in vain for a meeting with Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. Protesters accused the police of rough handling.

An Associated Press photographer witnessed police officers heading into the crowd of demonstrators to make the arrests.

Meanwhile,
 about 700 members of the Service Employees International Union marched 
through the Financial District; the union, which represents 23,000 
office cleaners, is gearing up for contract negotiations with the Realty
 Advisory Board.

More protests are planned in Toronto and Vancouver this weekend, and European activists also are organizing.

Meanwhile, a lawyer for a woman 
pepper-sprayed during an action last month is demanding that the 
Manhattan district attorney prosecute an NYPD deputy inspector on an 
assault charge.

Commissioner
 Raymond Kelly said the matter was being investigated by police internal
 affairs and the Civilian Complaint Review Board.
