The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 both hit all-time highs today as investors gave their stamp of approval to the Republican takeover of the US Senate. 

The Down was up 100.69 points, 0.6percent, and closed at a record 17,484.53. The S&P was also up 0.6percent and closed at a record 2023.57.

Energy companies, which have suffered massive losses thanks to cheap oil, led the rally over hopes that the new GOP majority will lead to approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada and the easing of environmental regulations, which business say have become stricter and more cumbersome under President Barack Obama's administration.

The president had blocked construction of the Keystone XL pipeline over environmental concerns, but will now face increasing pressure to approve the project.

The S&P energy index was the only one of ten primary S&P 500 sectors to be negative for the year, though it rose 1.6percent Tuesday as the strongest group of the day.

Equities rose on relief that election results were clear, with the upcoming Senate majority party not in doubt. Investors had been concerned that some close races would be forced into run-offs, an outcome that could have led to weeks of delay in knowing which party would control Congress's upper chamber. 

'It had looked like some of the races would be very close and that we might not know who controlled the Senate, but in the end the results were pretty decisive,' said John Carey, portfolio manager at Pioneer Investment Management in Boston. 

'That's good news for the industries that had been subject to regulatory issues.'

Business is hoping that the new Republican majority could also lead to deals on immigration reform, a reform of the tax code that would cut rates while limiting deductions and reducing red tape that advocates say has piled up since Obama took office.

Also helping the markets rally was a positive jobs report. US private employers added 230,000 jobs in October, more than expected and the most since June, according to the ADP National Employment report. The data could raise hopes for Friday's closely-watched payroll report.

Separately, the pace of growth in the US services sector slowed more than expected in October, sliding for a second month to its lowest level since June, according to the Institute for Supply Management's services index.

Time Warner Inc rose 2.9 percent to $77.16 after it reported revenue growth of 3 percent. Activision Blizzard Inc late Tuesday raised its full-year forecast, sending shares up 3 percent to $20.55.

Limiting the Nasdaq's advance, TripAdvisor Inc dropped 14 percent to $72.29 and was the S&P's biggest decliner a day after posting weaker-than-expected earnings. FireEye Inc fell 15 percent to $29.08 a day after the cybersecurity company's revenue outlook was largely below expectations.

At 12.07pm, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 95.27 points, or 0.55 percent, to 17,479.11, the S&P 500 gained 9.86 points, or 0.49 percent, to 2,021.96 and theNasdaq Composite added 9.28 points, or 0.2 percent, to 4,632.92.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,796 to 1,130, for a 1.59-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,562 issues rose and 1,033 fell for a 1.51-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.

The benchmark S&P 500 index was posting 83 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 92 new highs and 38 new lows.
