Tony Blair today insisted it was not his job to save the Labour party as he gave lukewarm support to Ed Miliband's beleaguered leadership.

The former prime minister was repeatedly pressed on live TV about the crisis in the Labour party, insisting it was 'not a topic for me' and only eventually conceding Mr Miliband has his 'full support'.

And after Mr Miliband's week of dire headlines and warnings many want him to quit, Mr Blair told him bluntly: 'That’s what leadership is about.'

Former Prime Minister Tony Blair today insisted it was not his job to rescue the Labour party, and told Ed Miliband that bad headlines was what leadership is all about

Mr Blair met Mr Miliband at the weekend when they attended the Remembrance Sunday ceremony at the Cenotaph.

Sunday's newspapers were dominated by headlines about concern at the highest levels of the Labour party that Mr Miliband's poor personal ratings could cost the party victory next year.

Grilled on Sky News today, Mr Blair insisted he did not discuss Labour's woes with Mr Miliband at all.

And he seemed reluctant to even discuss the prospects of the party he led to three historic election victories.

Mr Blair was being interview by Sky presenter Kay Burley about the work of his foundation in Sierra Leone to tackle Ebola.

But Ms Burley said she was sure the former PM would accept some questions about Labour

Mr Blair replied curtly: 'I don’t know what makes you sure I’ll accept it, because I don’t really want to talk about that today.'

Insisting he did not want to discuss Labour at all, adding: 'What’s going on in politics back home I will comment on when I’m back home.'

Sky News presenter Kay Burley repeatedly pressed Mr Blair for his views on the party he led to three election victories, but he insisted he did not want to talk about it

When it was suggested that his former colleagues might appreciate some advice from the election winner, Mr Blair replied: 'I doubt it.'

On Mr Miliband's torrid time amid mounting criticism of his stewardship of the Labour party, Mr Blair insisted: 'Exactly, that’s what leadership is about and I'm sure he is robust enough to take it.' 

Asked if Mr Miliband was the 'right man for the job', Mr Blair replied: 'I have had these things a thousand times and I’ve always said he has my full support and that’s the end of it, so… you know…'

When it was suggested he might 'ride back into town and save the Labour party', Mr Blair retorted: 'Well that’s not my job nowadays.'

The interview was then quickly brought to a close. 

Support for Mr Miliband has plummeted even among his party's supporters. Pollsters YouGov found that only 34 per cent of people who voted Labour at the last General Election believe Mr Miliband is up to the job of Prime Minister, compared to 51 per cent just a month ago.

The sheer scale of the unhappiness is also highlighted by the fact that 45 per cent of those who voted Labour in 2010 believe he should quit as party leader.

An opinion poll by Lord Ashcroft put Labour on just 29 per cent, the same level of support secured by Gordon Brown in the 2010 general election.

Alan Johnson last night ruled out replacing Mr Miliband as Labour leader, saying he would ‘never’ take the job.

The popular former home secretary threw Mr Miliband a lifeline by warning rebel MPs that he will not step in if the beleaguered leader is ousted.

It comes after claims up to one in five of Mr Miliband's frontbenchers was ready to call on him to go, with Mr Johnson favourite as a caretaker leader.

‘I have never stood for the leadership of my party, and for the avoidance of doubt, regardless of the circumstances, I never will,’ he told The Guardian.

His comments are a blow to rebel MPs who want Mr Miliband to go for the sake of the party, as Mr Johnson is viewed as one of the few figures who could unite Labour in the six months before the election.

Mr Johnson said Mr Miliband was ‘entitled to our loyalty’. But he revealed that he had turned down Mr Miliband’s request to take a senior front line role in the election campaign, saying that he would only offer informal help from the backbenches.

Earlier, Mr Miliband attempted to get on the front foot after enduring days of sniping from his own side, by giving a major speech on Europe to the CBI.

But his woes pursued him to the business organisation’s conference in London, where one delegate asked him whether he now wished he had lost the leadership to his elder brother David. ‘Certainly not,’ Mr Miliband snapped back.

Kay Burley: While we’ve got you I’m sure that you would accept a question or two about the Labour party here back home in the United Kingdom at the moment. We saw you at the cenotaph on Sunday with Mr Miliband...

Tony Blair: I don’t know what makes you sure I’ll accept it, because I don’t really want to talk about that today.

KB: I’m sure. But while I have if I could possibly ask you…

TB: You’re going to ask me anyway.

KB: I am, obviously. Did you talk at all about his leadership woes while you were at the Cenotaph?

TB: Actually I didn’t. But in any event that’s not a topic for me today.

KB: Can I ask why not?

TB: Because I am here dealing… I am building my team, I spending the entire day concentrating on Ebola and what my foundation is doing with others to try and curb it. And you know…. Something like… what’s going on in politics back home I will comment on when I’m back home.

KB: Do you not think though that the Labour party back here would really appreciate maybe just sixty seconds of comment from you?

TB: I doubt it.

KB: Oh, I’m sure they would.

TB: I’m sure you might.

KB: How much sympathy do you think Ed Miliband should… or how much sympathy do you have for his plight, he is having a tough week. You used to have lots of bad headlines.

TB: Exactly, that’s what leadership is about and I'm sure he is robust enough to take it. So um… if you have got nothing on Ebola I think I’ll return to what I am doing here.

KB: I will ask you one more question about Ebola but before that could I just ask do you think he is the right man for the job?

TB: Oh please Kay, honestly. I have had these things a thousand times and I’ve always said he has my full support and that’s the end of it, so… you know…

KB: And from you are going on to Guinea and Liberia, what are you doing there?

TB: So my foundation also works in those countries as well and has worked for some period of time and now the teams have obviously been diverted on to fight Ebola, but we are also trying to give though as to how this whole part of West Africa once Ebola is out of the way, how the economy recovers here. ‘Cos obviously for the future its important these countries recover and go back on to a forward path.

KB: OK just before you go you are not going to ride back into town and save the Labour party are you?

TB: Well that’s not my job nowadays. Right now I am in Freetown Sierra Leone…

KB: We’ll leave you to it.
