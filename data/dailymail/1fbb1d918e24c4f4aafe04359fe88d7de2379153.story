A teenage mother has been found guilty of breaking nine of her son’s bones over a span of six months.

Kiara Mayne Estright, 19, has been convicted of aggravated assault, endangering the welfare of a child, as well as simple assault and reckless endangerment.

The mother, who lives in Reading, Pennsylvania, was charged last year with the crimes, after she repeatedly showed up at emergency rooms in Reading and Philadelphia to get her son treatment for numerous broken bones.

Guilty: Kiara Mayne Estright has been found guilty of abusing her toddler-aged son

The Reading Eagle reported that Estright’s trial lasted three days, and the jury deliberated for hours before returning with their guilty verdict.

In total, her son suffered a broken leg, another broken leg after his cast was removed, as well as a broken arm, broken hand, broken collar bone, and a skull fracture. He also had broken ribs.

Estright told the court that the injuries came about because her son is highly active. ‘He was always running around,’ she said. ‘I let him be a boy.’

Assistant District Attorney Ellen R. West said that since her son has been placed in foster care, he has not sustained any injuries.

She further noted that the entirety of the boy’s many breaks happened when he was between 15 and 22 months, and only when he was in his mother’s care.

The Eagle previously reported that authorities were alerted last October after Estright brought her son to the hospital with a broken arm. 

After authorities were alerted, the hospital staff performed a full body scan on the toddler, revealing several breaks and fractures in various states of healing.

At the time, Estright defended herself by saying her toddler broke his ribs after she accidentally grabbed him too hard, and said he fractured his skull by hitting the headboard too hard.
