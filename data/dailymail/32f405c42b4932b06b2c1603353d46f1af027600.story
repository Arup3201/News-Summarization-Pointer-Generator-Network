First came the internet spoofs, followed by a Christmas card featuring Ellen Degeneres and Portia de Rossi.

Now supermarket ASDA have become the latest to produce a version of Kim Kardashian's infamous 'Break the Internet' shoot - and are using it to sell £10 champagne. 

The supermarket has recreated photographer Jean Goude’s image using a Kim lookalike who poses with a champagne coupe resting on her bottom, a spray of drink arching over her head and into the glass.

Which one is which? Asda have copied John Goude's now famous photograph of Kim Kardashian in a bid to promote their Christmas Champagne offer

The advert reads, ‘DON’T BREAK THE BUDGET, PIERRE DARCYS’ - a reference to the store's budget champagne. 

ASDA's new Kim spoof is the latest in a series, all of which have flooded the internet since Kim's Paper magazine cover was revealed last week.

Kim has been transformed into a centaur, a Simpsons character and has even had googly eyes superimposed onto her bottom.

Other memes have compared Kim’s shapely derriere to anything from a glazed crispy crème donut, to a pair of peaches and perhaps, least flatteringly, a potato.

But the photographs - one of which shows Kim standing front on completely naked -  have not received an entirely positive reaction.

Indeed, such was the furore that Paper magazine editor, Micky Boardman, was forced to come to Kim's defense over the weekend.

He denied claims that her bottom in particular had been digitally enhanced and insisted that every part of it was the real deal.

'The body is Kim’s body,’ he said. ‘Yes the image is retouched as all photos on the covers of magazines are retouched.

'If you know Jean-Paul’s work, you know he creates magic like the splash of the champagne over the head with pasting images together. As for the butt we didn’t pad it or make it bigger. It’s all her.’

Amusing: Kim was turned into a Simpsons character by Alexsandro Palombo 

Kim happily posed for photographer Jean-Paul Gaude, however, the photographs have become the subject of many memes, spoofs and parodies

Kim has also spoken out about the images, saying 'I'm never one to preach, but I felt really positive and really good about myself. 

'I like the photos, I did it for me, I hope other people like them.'

She also revealed that the champagne glass pose wasn't as easy as it looked. 'My back hurt for about a week after that shoot...[photographer Jean-Paule Goude] has an art of posing you and it was definitely not comfortable.'
