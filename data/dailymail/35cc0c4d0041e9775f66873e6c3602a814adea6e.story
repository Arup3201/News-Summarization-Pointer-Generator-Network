John and Corinne Clarkson have created what they claim is the world's tallest burger, the Pie-scraper

At 5ft 4in it stands taller than most children and its 30,000 calories could sustain a man for almost two weeks.

The Pie-scraper is thought to be the world's tallest burger - incorporating 10 three-quarter pound cheeseburgers and another 11-and-a-half pounds of beef encasing pies, sausage rolls, a bacon butty, spam and spaghetti bolognese.

Takeaway boss John Clarkson of the Mister Eater's Eating Emporium in Preston, Lancashire, is the man behind the towering dish, which comes with 8.5kg of beef and is served with a side salad of lettuce.

For a man adhering to the recommended 2,500 calories a day, the giant burger tower would keep him sustained for almost a fortnight.

The 54-year-old, who is 5ft 6in - two inches taller than his creation - is claiming the world record for his Pie-scraper, which is on display in his shop.

'I’ve researched to see if anyone has created a taller burger but no one has,' he said.

'We’ve already created a full burger encased inside another burger so I just thought why not try other things inside a burger? Say, a pork pie, a chip butty or a pizza?'

Mr Clarkson and his wife Corinne, 39, spent an hour-and-a-half assembling the structure on a specially-made metal stand to ensure the tower didn’t topple.

The three-quarter pound cheeseburger surrounded by chips is the first rung on the ladder, followed by a pork pie with Branston pickle encased in one-and-a-quarter pounds of beef.

Each burger bun needed to be extra-large so they were also made to order from a local baker.

Then between each cheeseburger lies a different meal encased in burger meat.

Standing at 5ft 4in the PIe-scraper burger tower is only two inches shy of Mr Clarkson's 5ft 6in

The pie-scraper contains a staggering 30,000 calories with spam, black pudding, sausage, steak pie, meatballs, a meat and potato pie and even mushy peas and pepperoni pizza encased in 8.5kg of beef

There is Spam, black pudding and sausage; steak pie and mushroom; a bacon butty; spaghetti bolognese and meatballs; a cheeseburger; meat and potato pie with mushy peas with the final burger containing three layers of pepperoni pizza.

If that wasn’t enough to lay claim to Britain’s biggest burger, above each cheeseburger is a layer of bacon with added hash browns, onion rings and peppers at different levels for good measure.

Mrs Clarkson said: 'Everyone thinks we are a bit nuts but they aren’t surprised by the things we do now. It’s just about putting a smile on people’s faces and trying to do things bigger and better every time.'

Due to its sheer size, the burger was only on display at the popular chippy for a day, before it was then devoured by staff and a few lucky customers.

Those who would like to fork out and cook a replica would be set back £150 - but Mrs Clarkson admits it could never be sold.

'It’s a bit of fun and everyone loves a good challenge,' she added.

'And it’s not just the gimmick - I can honestly say the pizza burger is delicious!'

Mr and Mrs Clarkson spent an hour-and-a-half constructing their masterpiece, displaying it at their Mister Eaters Eating Emporium in Preston, Lancashire for a day before it was devoured by staff and a few  customers

The Clarksons are no stranger to cooking up extravagant menu options, with 10,000-calorie cheeseburger encased in another burger

Chip shop owners Mr and Mrs Clarkson are no strangers to cooking up extravagant ideas.

The couple turned giant TV cartoon food into reality by creating a 10,000-calorie burger.

Dubbed the ‘Ulti-Meatum’, the sandwich is a cheeseburger encased in another burger and held together by two buns, also made from burgers.

The dish was being sold for £20 at the couple's Mister Eaters Eating Emporium in Preston.

It is modelled on a meal from The Best Burger In The World episode of Cartoon Network hit The Regular Show.

In the show, the characters of Mordecai, a Blue Jay and a raccoon named Rigby do everything they can to try and eat the burger, which is so good it can only be sold to one customer every 100 years.

But fans can now get their hands on a real-life version of the calorific creation for free - only if they dare to take on the challenge of finishing it in one.

Anyone who attempts the Man v. Food-style challenge will have to consume five pounds of beef, as well as six slices of cheese and three whole buns.

Mrs Clarkson, said: ‘I saw a few people had tried to make it on YouTube but they were terrible.'
