An insulted mother has vowed to boycott a Sydney café after she claims she was told to leave because she had her 11 month-old son in a pram.

Jessica Smith says her relaxing morning coffee date with a friend ended in complete humiliation when she was forced to leave the almost empty Gnome Café in Surry Hills after she said the manager told her there was no room for her baby’s pram.

‘I found it offensive and unreasonable – if it was a bar I would understand,’ the Redfern resident told Daily Mail Australia. ‘You would think that mums would be bread and butter for a lot of these places.’

The Gnome cafe manager said parents and babies were always welcome but there was no space for prams in the small cafe in Surry Hills

The 35-year-old said she deliberately positioned the pram against a wall in a corner.

‘There was only one person sitting inside and one person on an outside table - then when I walked past an hour later there was no one in there,’ she said.

She said will never go back  to the cafe after the humiliating experience of being turfed out.

Ms Smith was so gobsmacked by the incident that she posted her outrage on Facebook saying: ‘Wow, just told we can't have coffee at Gnome on crown because we have a baby with us! Won't be going back there.'

The Gnome café manager declined to comment to Daily Mail Australia but replied to a friend of Ms Smith’s who complained on the cafe’s Facebook page.

The manger said children of any age were welcome in the cafe but because it was small, there wasn't enough room for prams inside.

But Ms Smith said it didn't make sense that prams were not allowed.

‘Essentially he could have asked us to go to an outside table if it was genuinely a space/business issue,' she said.

Ms Smith's post sparked a similar reaction from other disgusted mothers

The post sparked a similar reaction from other disgusted mothers.

One mother said that type of attitude went out ‘centuries ago’ while another described the incident as discrimination.

Another suggested that ordering alcohol would have been met with a different response.

‘But I'm sure if you'd asked for a whiskey or wine they would have happily indulged!’

The woman said: ‘Shame on you for not allowing parents with babies to have coffee on your premises! Will make sure all my friends know about this and we certainly won't be visiting whether we have baby in tow or not!’

The manager’s responded to the comment explaining that although parents and children of any age were always welcome but ‘because we are a small cafe though we just don't have enough space to have prams inside.’
