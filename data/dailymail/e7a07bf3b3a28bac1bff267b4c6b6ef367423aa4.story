A former Ohio police officer who earlier confessed to filming himself having sex with a 15-year-old girl was sentenced to spend nearly twenty years behind bars, it emerged Wednesday.

Charles Locke, 42, formerly with the Cleveland Police Department, was sentenced by Judge Carolyn Friedland to 19-and-a-half years,  WOIO reported.

Chris Schroeder, an assistant prosecutor for Cuyahoga County, said in a sentencing filmed by the affiliate station 'In one of these videos, he's actually wearing his uniform.'

Sentenced: Former Cleveland police officer Charles Locke was sentenced to 19-and-a-half years behind bars

Those videos were not presented in the courtroom, WOIO reported.

The victim's upset father told Locke on Wednesday in the sentencing taped by the affiliate station 'That's my 15-year-old daughter, bro, for real, man. That's my family, man.'

The victim's mother, meanwhile, asked 'Is there anything other than you mentoring my daughter going on here? Because you knew you would lose your job if it was.'

She had earlier grilled Locke several months back about his relationship with her daughter, with whom he hung out at various locations including a rec center and even his police cruiser, WOIO reported.

The teenage girl said in a written statement read by a counselor in court  'I trusted him a lot. My mood now changes too much. I'm depressed. I'm sad, mad, and sometimes happy.'

On the job: Five years ago, serial killer Anthony Sowell was arrested by Charles Locke. Locke is seen here in 2011 giving testimony in that case 

Courtroom: Sgt. Carl Hartman, seen standing, said Wednesday 'Charles Locke is a monster' 

Sgt. Carl Hartman with Internal Affairs condemned Locke, saying 'At best, Charles Locke is an embarrassment to his loyal friends and co-workers,'The Plain Dealer reported. 'He is a cancer among the proud, honest and hard-working members of the Cleveland Division of Police. Ultimately, Locke is an aberration to the good citizens of the city of Cleveland. Charles Locke is a monster.'

Five years ago, serial killer Anthony Sowell was arrested by Locke.

Locke, meanwhile, told the judge 'I was out of my mind' and that he had been working multiple jobs and was sleep-deprived -  and defense attorney Deanna Robertson defended her client, saying he 'lost touch with reality,' according to The Plain Dealer.

Locke entered guilty pleas in October, the newspaper reported, for multiple charges: five counts of pandering sexually oriented matter involving a minor, two counts of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor as well as one count of possessing criminal tools. 

The victim's parents offered their forgiveness to Locke in court, with the mother saying 'I have sympathy and empathy for you,' the newspaper reported.
