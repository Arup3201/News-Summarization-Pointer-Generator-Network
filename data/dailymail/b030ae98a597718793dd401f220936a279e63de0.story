They're going to need a bigger boat.

New York fishermen have reeled in the second Great White Shark in less than a week just a few miles from popular Rockaway Beach.

Bobby Jahrnes, from Queens, caught the 80-pound fish about 6pm Thursday on a fishing trip with his father and son.  

'My son brought it to the boat and we thought it was a blue shark,' Jahrnes, who works as a carpenter, told The New York Post. 'But when it came closer, we realized it wasn’t. The colors and the snout on it - it was definitely a great white.'

Big haul: Bobby Jahrnes together with his father and son reeled in this big Great White Shark near Rockaway Beach, New York on Thursday night

Jaharnes said it wasn't the same shark that was caught on Sunday by his friend Steve Fernandez, as it didn't have holes or hooks in it.

The third generation fisherman said it's likely the place he caught the shark is a spawning ground for them.

'I’ve been shark fishing my entire life. You used to have to go
 out 40 miles to even catch a decent-sized shark,' he said.

'But to go 
out for three hours and only be five miles off the beach and catch three
 different species of sharks - that tells me there’s a lot of sharks out
 there. ...There's
 a big group of baby Jaws out there.'

Fernandez,
 29, a Breezy Point native, was on a fishing trip with friends about one mile from Rockaway Beach when he hauled in an 80-pound Great White.

'We put our hook in the water, got it next to the boat and that’s 
when we realized it was a great white,' the insurance salesman said in an interview with The New York Post.

This baby great white was hooked a mile from Rockaway Beach by friends Pat Butera, Lawrence Benin, and Steve Fernandez

Fishermen saw the shark's mother swimming just a little farther out

He added: 'I’ve been 
fishing my whole life but I’ve never seen one a mile off the beach.

'I
 probably know more about fishing than I know about myself. As soon as 
we saw it, there’s no mistaking it. ...It’s basically a 
miniature version of the shark you see in the movie ‘Jaws'.'

He said the shark's 600-pound mother was swimming close by.

New York state regulations state that animals such as Great Whites be returned to the water with 'a minimum of injury.'

Meanwhile, fisherman Greg Grodecki told NBC New York he was fishing with friends about 15 miles off the shore of Fire Island, Long Island on Sunday when a wide-mouthed fish bumped his boar,

He said it looked like a Great White Shark.

'It was just amazing to see it, so beautiful and powerful,' Grodecki said. 'It's just a great experience.'

Another shark, also possibly a Great White, was spotted on Saturday off the coast of Cape May in New Jersey.

Phil Argiros from the Long Island Aquarium and Exhibition Center told NBC that the Great White population is increasing due to conservation efforts.

'I think their numbers are increasing, so we are going to see more of them,' he said.
