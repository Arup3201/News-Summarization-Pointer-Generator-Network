Police have revealed that the drifter accused of raping an elderly woman in broad daylight in New York's Central Park was also linked to a 2002 murder in his home state of West Virginia, although investigators have never had enough evidence to charge him.

David Albert Mitchell, 42, has had run-ins with the law for virtually all of his adult life, and was twice charged with crimes in which the alleged victim was an elderly woman, according to court records and a prosecutor.

Alleged rapist: David Albert Mitchell, pictured, has been arrested in connection with the brutal rape of a 73-year-old birdwatcher in Central Park on Wednesday morning

An ex-girlfriend says he bragged about killing Barbara Flake in the tiny West Virginia community of Jenkinjones, an impoverished and tightknit community in the state's southern coalfields.

West Virginia State Police determined the woman died from a blow to the head when they found her skull two years after she disappeared from her home. But there was never enough information or probable cause to arrest Mitchell, said Sgt. C.F. Kane.

Mitchell's onetime girlfriend, Saretta Mitchell, told The Associated Press that the man once bragged about killing Flake - a claim she reported to police when Flake's remains were found.

'In a social setting, when there's alcohol involved, he will tell you anything,' she said. 'He bragged to me and some of our friends at different times that he had murdered two people.'

The rape charge against David Mitchell is just his latest brush with the law. Police in New York City say he raped a 73-year-old birdwatcher who took a compromising photo of him.

Mitchell was arraigned early Friday on charges of first-degree rape, robbery, assault and other charges and ordered held without bail, prosecutors said. A call to his attorney at arraignment was not returned.

Earlier, Mitchell said nothing as he was led from the special victims unit to face charges in court, but he spat at reporters gathered there. He was also charged with threatening a man last month with a knife in the same area of the park.

He told the man, according to investigators: 'I have no problem stabbing you as many times as I want and making this circle full of blood.'

Mitchell's disturbing criminal 
history began when he was 18, when he was charged with molesting and beating 
to death 87-year-old Annie Parks during a burglary in Jenkinjones, his 
hometown.

A jury did not convict him, but 
months later he was accused of raping a woman in her 70s during another 
home invasion reported the Charleston Gazette.

Mitchell pleaded guilty to first-degree robbery in that trial and was sentenced to 10 years in prison, of which he served eight.

After his release, the suspect was 
arrested twice more and then was convicted of kidnapping in 2003 and was
sent to prison to serve an eight-year sentence.

Over the past two years he has been 
hauled in by police for probation violations and petty crimes, but had 
not served a significant stretch in prison before coming to New York.

Mitchell's sister-in-law and 
ex-girlfriend Saretta Mitchell told the Associated Press that she was 
the victim in the 2003 kidnapping and that Mitchell attempted to 
sexually assault her.

She said that his crimes 'were always sexually driven.'

The victim in the Central Park attack told investigators she 
believed a previous encounter with the man, where she took a photograph 
of him exposing himself, may have prompted the gruesome attack, which 
left her bruised and battered.

She said her attacker asked, 'Do you 
remember me?' before pushing her to the ground and raping her 'vaginally
and rectally' at about 11am in a wooded area near the park's tranquil 
Strawberry Fields. The area serves as a memorial to John Lennon.

In the horrific attack, the elderly 
woman said she was thrown to the ground and sexually assaulted by the 
man who then made off with her backpack, which contained her camera. He 
also tried to steal her watch but was unsuccessful.

Shaken up but mostly angry, the woman told The New York Post what punishment she believes her attacker deserves.

'Kill
him,' she said. 'Cut off his penis. That’s fine. Cut off his feet, then
hit him over the head. Then give him life in prison.

'I’m
a little jittery. I get the shakes. But I’m more angry. I hope he goes 
to jail for a long time, and he gets raped, over and over again.'

The woman, who regularly visits the 
park, said she thinks the assailant was the same man she photographed 
masturbating about 10 days ago in another, more isolated spot known as 
The Ramble.

She said he demanded she delete the 
image before they went their separate ways during their previous 
encounter, and tried to grab her camera but didn't succeed. Police said 
that initial encounter wasn't reported.

In yesterday's meeting, the woman said the man approached her and asked if she remembered him. When she said no, he attacked.

'He
pounced on me,' she told The Post. 'He jumped on my back... I started 
screaming. And he said, ‘You don’t scream!’ And he grabbed my throat.'I 
still screamed. ‘He said, ‘I’ll cut your jugular!’ I stopped screaming.

Then 'he raped me — vaginally and rectally. Brutally,' she said.

After the rape, the man repeated, 
'I’ll cut your jugular. He mashed my head into the dirt. He said, ‘You 
stay there and count to 100.’ I counted to 100.

'This guy knew what he wanted to do. He wanted to beat the s--t out of me. I think he’s beaten women before.'

Eric Ozawa, a college professor and birdwatcher, found the woman and called 911.

He
told reporters he noticed a pair of legs sticking out along the path 
but thought it was somebody sleeping.

As he got closer, he realized it 
was a woman lying face down. Her face was badly swollen, she had a black
eye, a broken eye socket and was covered in mulch.

Still, she appeared 'self-possessed and lucid,' Ozawa said.

After the woman told Ozawa she had been mugged and raped, he immediately called the police.

'It's shocking that it could happen in the park in broad daylight,' he said. 'That someone could rape somebody in her 70s.'

Investigators interviewed Ozawa on Wednesday, while other officers and detectives swarmed the scene in search of the suspect.

Police blocked off much of the area 
near West 72nd Street and Central Park West as they hunted for a suspect
described as a man in his 40s.

The
victim told The Post he spoke with a eastern European accent that may 
have been Russian. Mitchell is believed to have an accent although he is
not Russian, DNA Info reported.

Authorities yesterday released surveillance images of the suspect who was wearing black pants, a black T-shirt and white sneakers.

He was carrying a backpack that resembled the one stolen from the woman, and also wearing a second backpack.

Alexander Stein, 48, who runs a picture booth nearby, told DNA Info he saw a police officer near Strawberry Fields get the call about the crime and race over, followed moments later by more squad cars and an ambulance.

'Things happen here every day,' Stein told the news website. 'But when police start running in every direction and ambulances come, you know something serious has happened.'

Emily Loubaton, 29, was in the park on a scavenger hunt that her company had organized.

'I think this is pretty disgusting, and so shocking it would happen on such a beautiful day in such a beautiful park,' she said.

Scene: The attack took place in a popular area of the park dedicated to John Lennon

Asked if she felt less safe in Central 
Park, she said: 'I'd like to believe that New York City has turned the 
corner for the better. I mean, this isn't the 70s. But it definitely 
makes you pause before you walk in.'

The victim told The Post that she wasn't frightened to return to Central Park and would not let the attacker stop her enjoying the area.

'I’m not scared. I don’t want to lose that pleasure. I won’t let anything keep me from enjoying the park,' she said.

'I’m not going back looking like this, but of course I’ll go back. It’s my park. I look like hell, but it will heal. I can see I’m alive.'

But she admitted she may lose some sleep after the horrific attack.

'I know tonight, I will have a little trouble. I’ll feel the weight of him pushing me to the ground, and pummel, pummel, pummel,' she told the newspaper, punching the air around her.
