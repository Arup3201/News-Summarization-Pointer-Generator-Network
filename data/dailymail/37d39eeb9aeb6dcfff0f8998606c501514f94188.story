Spain has been accused of ‘absurdity and hypocrisy’ after allowing three Russian navy ships to dock in its territories in north Africa.

British MPs said Madrid’s decision to allow the vessels - including a heavily-armed destroyer - to take on fuel, food and other supplies offered ‘succour’ to Moscow.

Incredibly, the vessels docked in Ceuta as tensions between Nato - of which Spain is a member - and Russia mounted over the crisis in Ukraine.

It also highlighted Spanish double-standards over controlling territory in Morocco while sabre-rattling about British sovereignty over Gibraltar, a UK territory since 1713.

Last night WED Tory MP Andrew Rosindell, a member of Parliament’s all-party group on Gibraltar, said: ‘How is the defence alliance supposed to work if members of Nato behave like this?

‘It is completely perverse and highlights the absurdity and short-sightedness of Spain’s position. We are supposed to be allies.

‘It is also blatantly hypocritical to allow Russian warships to use a territory which is not part of mainland Spain while complaining to the UK about us having Gibraltar.

‘Spain is going to achieve nothing by pursuing these shoddy and nonsensical policies.’

Spain has held Ceuta and Melilla, two ports of almost 100,000 people each and islands on the north African coast, for around 500 years ago.

Two weeks ago, three Russian navy ships - the 6,900-tonne destroyer Vice Admiral Kulakov and tankers Duban and Sergey Osipov - docked at Ceuta, less than 50miles across the Mediterranean from Gibraltar.

The warship, which carries 350 troops, took on board 740 tons of diesel and 100 tons of water.

Russian Navy ships have visited Ceuta six times since the beginning of the year.

The El Pueblo De Ceuta newspaper reported ‘Together with the welcome and good treatment of its [Russian] personnel the visits have benefitted the city’s businesses.’

The latest visit raised eyebrows as diplomatic relations between the West and Moscow have cooled over the crisis engulfing Ukraine.

Armed pro-Kremlin separatists have taken over towns and cities in eastern Ukraine in protest at the toppling of Moscow-aligned president Viktor Yanukovych in February.

It prompted Russia to annexe Crimea and send troops across the border into its former Soviet neighbour - a move condemned by the West.

Nato has responded by increasing its military presence in the Baltics, to send a message to Vladimir Putin not to try and stir up unrest in Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia.

Three weeks ago, the Royal Navy sent Type 45 destroyer HMS Dragon to track the Vice Admiral Kulakov as it approached British waters.

In an echo of the Cold War, it scrambled to escort the vessel past the waters off Scotland.

Even though the Russian ship did not enter UK territorial waters, the Portsmouth-based HMS Dragon is kept at high-readiness to respond to such events.

Nato, including Spain and Britain, had formed a defence alliance against Russia as the Ukraine conflict continues

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said the deployment of HMS Dragon was ‘pre-planned’ after the Navy was notified of the Russian’s route.

Some military experts believe Russia is testing out UK defences.

Davis Lewin, political director of the Henry Jackson Society think-tank, urged Nato to raise the issue of Russian naval vessels docking in Ceuta with Madrid.

He said: ‘Nato has always sought cooperation with a responsible Russia to further post-Cold War stability in Europe and wider afield.

‘Given Vladimir Putin’s illegal aggression against the people of the Ukraine however, this cooperation must be subject to review. This should include arrangements between member countries and Russia such as Russian Warships docking in Ceuta.

‘NATO is designed to protect us from exactly this menace. Its posture at this time should sharply remind Mr Putin about the costs of aggression against democratic neighbours.’

The Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Madrid did not respond to calls last night.
