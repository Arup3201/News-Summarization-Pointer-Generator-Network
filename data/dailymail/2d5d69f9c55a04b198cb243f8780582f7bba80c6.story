The model accused of bringing down Clippers boss Donald Sterling earned a living as a stripper, her former high school teacher has claimed.

And V Stiviano – the girl at the center of a race scandal that has rocked the NBA this week – even bragged to football coach Javier Cid that she'd had a boob job aged just 17.

Stiviano – who went by the name Vanessa Perez at Roosevelt High School in Los Angeles – was also nicknamed 'Barbie' by other students because she dressed flamboyantly in expensive clothes.

Swelling with pride: Stiviano was 17 when she went running up to her high school's football coach and exclaimed 'Coach Cid, coach Cid, I've got my boobs done', he told MailOnline

Bling: Her high school teacher claimed that she rolled into high school in 2007 in a Range Rover which got tongues wagging

She later rolled through the school gates in a Range Rover – a lifestyle Mr Cid believes she paid for through her job as a pole-dancer.

This comes as it emerged the 31-year-old's mentor is a notorious sex author who wrote a book called The Vixen Manual: How to Find, Seduce & Keep the Man You Want.

Stiviano is close pals with Karrine Steffans, a former stripper who has also modeled in dozens of hip-hop music videos. She also revealed to Oprah Winfrey how she was sexually exploited to get roles in the videos.

Steffans also briefly gained notoriety in the hip-hop world more recently for posting a picture to Instagram of her performing a sex act.

Stiviano regularly gets Steffans tickets to Clippers games and the two often exchange messages on Instagram and post photos of them posing together.

Stiviano's former teacher believes she was always destined to lead an extravagant lifestyle.

Mr Cid said: 'Vanessa was a very confident, bold, outgoing girl. She'd roll in to school wearing $800 jeans.

'I always thought she was smart and very mature for her age and that she was just really into fashion and expensive things, maybe even borderline materialistic.

'But after she graduated I heard she had been working as a stripper and it all made total sense.

'She wasn't from a wealthy family and she was very independent, she made her own decisions in life.'

Stiviano's lawyer Mac Nehoray denied his client was ever a stripper.

High life: Stiviano's former teacher, Javier Cid, pictured left and right, believes she was always destined to lead an extravagant lifestyle

From high school to the high life: Stiviano went to Roosevelt High School in east LA. Cid told MailOnline: 'After she graduated I heard she had been working as a stripper and it all made total sense. She wasn't from a wealthy family and she was very independent, she made her own decisions in life'

He told MailOnline: 'That's not true. We vehemently deny that she ever worked as a stripper.'

The teacher, who is 16 years V's senior, said he was most shocked when his former student told him she had had a breast augmentation when she was just 17.

He said: 'I remember she told me she was thinking about having one done. Then a few months later I was talking to another teacher and Vanessa comes running over, she was like "Coach Cid, coach Cid, I've got my boobs done."

'I was very surprised, it was a little awkward. It's not the kind of thing you expect to hear from a female student.'

The teacher of 24 years at the school in East Los Angeles' Boyle Heights said Stiviano was in his civics and economics class in her senior year. He said she dreamed of being a model and was interested in the media.

'Boyle Heights is not very far from Hollywood and she was affected by that, she was a young girl growing up, who wouldn't want to be an actress or a model,' he said.

'She wanted to be famous and I'm sure there's a lots of people who would want to be in her shoes with the life she lives now.'

The teacher says that after seeing recent photos of Stiviano – snaps posted on her Instagram that emerged once the Clippers race scandal erupted - he was shocked by how much her appearance has changed since High School.

Envious: Cid said that many people would want to be in Stiviano's shoes having seen the money and fame she achieved. Here she is pictured yesterday with a friend in the Ferrari bought for her by Sterling

Playful: Stiviano threatened to put icing on her 80-year-old lover's face at the party which was held in the Staples Center where the LA Clippers play their home games. Not long after a tape she recorded with Donald Sterling brought him down

Old and slow: Stiviano added to her performance in front of the photographers by taking her 'pet turtle' for a walk - was it a dig at 80-year-old Donald Sterling?

Once a gold digger...: Cid said, 'She wouldn't date anyone in school, she was into older guys with a nice car'

'She was always a pretty girl but her nose is totally different now to how it was when she was a teenager, maybe she has had a nose job.

'Vanessa was certainly a very image conscious girl, the other kids would call her Barbie girl, she was that type, someone that wants to have the big car, the clothes, a nice house and designer clothes.

'She wore a lot of make-up and her image made her stand out, she liked being different. She was ahead of her time, very mature.'

Despite her good looks at high school Stiviano didn't date any of the boys in the football team.

Mr Cid added: 'She wouldn't date anyone in school, she was into older guys with a nice car, with money. I don't think Vanessa was hated, she got along with everyone, she was popular.

'She was a smart girl, spoke well and was eager about her future, I commend her for that.'

Mr Cid said he last saw Stiviano at Roosevelt in 2007 when she came in to talk about her younger sister who wasn't doing well at school. By then Stiviano's wealth had grown substantially.

'She came in to see me and I asked her how she was, you know how she was getting on in life.

'I remember that she said: "Oh, yeah, well I'm driving a Range Rover now." I remember that very clearly. I said, "Good for you."'

Mr Cid said he wished Stiviano all the best and said she had made a success of her life.

He said: 'If you look at economics she has turned out to be very successful. If you look at the cars and the big house, she must have done something right.

'I can't say I have those things on a teacher's salary.'

Mentor: The 31-year-old's mentor Steffans, pictured far left and far right with Stiviano, is a notorious sex author who wrote a book called The Vixen Manual: How to Find, Seduce & Keep the Man You Want

'She is a good communicator and can converse with sophisticated people she would have had to be like that to be able to hang out courtside with Clippers owner Don Sterling. She did not get by on her looks alone, she has a brain on her.'

Meanwhile, Stiviano has been reeling from a number of sinister death threats made against her. Many of the threats have been made on social network sites.

One chilling message posted on Twitter reads: 'V Stiviano gonna die in the next few weeks. Watch.'

Another said: 'V Stiviano is a dumb ass B*tch ... She needs to die slow.'

The brunette is believed to be seeing a counselor to help her deal with death threats – and the fallout from the scandal.

She has scaled down her activities and aside from leaving her home in a red Ferrari yesterday to have her hair done – she has barely left her $1.8m luxury condo.

Shaken Stiviano has also upped security at the plush duplex - on a quiet tree-line street near Beverley Hills - as a result of the threats.

Yesterday there were several flag-posts on display on her front lawn - advertising that four different security companies were patrolling the property.

A source said: 'V has been getting death threats and nasty messages ever since the racism tape came out. She is terrified so has hired security companies to patrol the home and even a bodyguard'.

Brains and beauty: Cid said, 'She did not get by on her looks alone, she has a brain on her'

Threats: According to unnamed sources Stiviano is now scared in the face of death threats made to her online

'It's all started to take it's toll on her – she's too scared to answer her door and she has stopped going out as much as she used to – which is not like her. She's scared to leave home now.'

Stiviano did not come outside when MailOnline called at her home - but instead choose to speak through the closed door.

She said: 'I am making no comment, no statement, nothing.'

Earlier this week, MailOnline revealed how Stiviano turned her back on her dirt-poor upbringing in San Antonio, Texas, where she was raised by a jobless Mexican mother convicted of using her own children to steal from a supermarket - to seek fame and fortune in Los Angeles.

Once in LA she got herself noticed through modelling and has even been linked to Jerry Buss, the late owner of the LA Lakers and a pal of Sterling's.

It also emerged that Stiviano, who was born Maria Perez, changed her name in 2010 in a bid to wipe out her past.

Giving a reason for the name change Stivano claimed in the court papers she hadn't 'yet been fully accepted because of my race.'

MailOnline has seen the documents but has chosen not to publish it due to its sensitive nature.
