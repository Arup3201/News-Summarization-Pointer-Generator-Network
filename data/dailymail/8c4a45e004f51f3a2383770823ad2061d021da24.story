Astrologer Russell Grant (pictured) believes zodiac signs influence our supermarket shopping habits

From shopaholics to those who can't stand supermarkets - Britain's consumer habits may simply be the result of their star sign, according to an astrologer.

Capricorns are canny and Scorpios are savvy because the way they buy their groceries is a reflection of their zodiac sign, claims stargazer and Strictly Come Dancing star Russell Grant.

He says shopping habits are dictated by star signs, so those who are Aries are more likely to spend as little time as possible in a supermarket - compared to Taurus, who like to splash out on big name brands.

Geminis fall for the adverts and buy things they don't need and Leos 'live for the sales', said the horoscope expert.

Mr Grant claims the habits apply whether it is an Aries in Asda, a Sagitarrius in Sainsbury's or even a virtual Virgo ordering their deliveries online.

So is he right? Here's what he believes your star sign says about your supermarket shopping habits:

ARIES: 'Not everyone enjoys food shopping. Aries won't hang around comparing brands and prices or reading labels. 

'They'll just want to grab a trolley, get into the store and get out again in less than 30 minutes.'

TAURUS: 'Taurus will pay extra for brands they trust. 

'They have a shopping list they always use but can be picky shoppers so what begins as a quick trip to the supermarket can turn into a day's excursion.'

GEMINI: 'Geminis are easily pulled in by seductive advertising and nine times out of ten will end up buying things they don't need or want. 

'They happily make use of self-service scanning and checkouts or ordering online to make food shopping easier.'

CANCER: 'Shopping for the family feels good and meets the Cancerian's emotional needs. 

'There's nothing they enjoy more than choosing food and household items while arranging their trolley so everything fits in neatly and nothing gets squashed.'

LEO: 'Leo loves to shop and lives for the sales. There's always the option of shopping on-line but Leo would rather experience the sights, sounds and smells of the supermarket than have shopping delivered to their door.'

VIRGO: 'From shopping trolleys with squeaky wheels to crowded aisles and long checkout queues Virgo can find plenty to complain about. They always using the same supermarket and know every product in every aisle to make navigating quick and simple.'

LIBRA: 'This is the shopper who stands for hours comparing 50 different types of cereal before deciding to opt for yoghurt instead. Spend hours checking sell-by dates on every item. Even picking the right lane at the checkout can be a major dilemma.'

SCORPIO: 'Scorpio won't be tricked into buying something they don't need just because it's on sale. Scorpio will have worked out the best times to shop so as to cut time wasted finding a parking space and walking around the store.'

SAGITTARIUS: 'Sagittarius finds any excuse to postpone food shopping. Once in the supermarket, they'll do anything to speed up the process including pinching ideas from another shopper's trolley rather than searching shelves to find an item.'

CAPRICORN: 'They have grocery shopping perfected into an efficient, streamlined process. Even at the checkout they will load items onto the conveyor belt in baggable order only to then hold up the queue by producing a discount coupon for every item.'

AQUARIUS: 'Little and often will be Aquarian's likely shopping style or better still they will click and collect or shop online and probably haven't touched a trolley in years.'

PISCES: 'Pisces can't resist a bargain and will stock up on anything that's on sale whether or not they need it. Because they would hate to hurt a salesperson's feelings they can be easily talked into making purchases.'
