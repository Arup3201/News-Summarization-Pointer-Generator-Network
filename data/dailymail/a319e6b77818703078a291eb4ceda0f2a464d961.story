A hardworking immigrant who won $1 million on the Illinois Lottery last summer died of a lethal dose of cyanide poisoning the day after receiving the check for his winnings.

Urooj Khan, 46, paid $60 for two lottery scratch-off tickets at Goreel's, a 7-11 convenience store in Chicago in June, and, upon scratching the second one, reportedly leaped in the air and shouted, 'I hit a million!'

The American dream: Khan emigrated to the U.S. from India during the 1980s and had opened a string of dry cleaning shops in his Chicago neighborhood. He bought this $1million scratch-off winner just before his death

Fateful purchase: Khan spent $60 in June on two Illinois state lottery tickets. The second one of which proved to be a winning ticket

Khan had apparently forsworn lotto after a trip to the Middle East in 2010, but broke down to buy the tickets at this Chicago 7-11 last June

Days later, with his wife and daughter at his side at the same convenience store, Khan gleefully - and fatefully - accepted an oversized, mock check from lottery officials.

At the time, he said he was going to utilize the money to pay bills, donate to St. Jude's Children's Hospital and grow his dry-cleaning business.

After taxes, the prize money amounted to $425,000 and Khan received his check a month after his win on July 19.

Khan went to work as normal the next day, but that night he woke up screaming in excruciating pain.

His frantic widow, Shabana Ansari, and daughter rushed to his side. The stricken Khan was taken to St. Francis Hospital in Evanston, where doctors pronounced him dead.

Khan's death was initially attributed to natural causes and his body was laid to rest at Rosehill Cemetery.

But within a week of Khan's death an unidentified relative phoned the Cook County Medical Examiner’s office and asked investigators to take another look.

‘They had concerns that it was deemed a natural cause of death and 
wanted us to look harder,’ Medical Examiner Dr. Stephen Cina told NBC Chicago.

When his investigators conducted comprehensive toxicology tests, they found lethal levels of cyanide.

'It is a very lethal drug,' Cina said. 'It’s a chemical poison. It 
basically asphyxiates you at the biochemical level, so a little goes a 
long way.'

The Chicago Police Department is now treating Khan's death as a homicide and is considering exhuming his body.

Khan emigrated to the U.S. during the 1980s, and through hard work and discipline, saved sufficiently to open first one and eventually three dry cleaning shops in Chicago.

The day after receiving a check for his winnings, Khan awoke screaming in pain in his bed at his Chicago home (pictured)

No signs of foul play: An initial autopsy on Khan performed by the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office found nothing awry

He opened the first of his stores in 2004 on a stretch of roadway known for its Indian and Pakistani restaurants, bakeries and bazaars.

The hardworking Khan personally oversaw the day-to-day operations at all three shops, which counted 10 employees. If a worker called in sick, Khan reportedly often handled cleaning and delivery duties in the employee's stead.

'By God's grace, he was a workaholic,' his widow Shabana Ansari told The Chicago Tribune. 'Day or night ... he picks up the phone 24/7.

'He made the clients happy by doing his job. He could not be everywhere, but he had to be everywhere.'

The very fact that he bought the winning lottery ticket represents an ironic - and fateful - misfortune.

The Tribune reports that after a 2010 Islamic pilgrimage to the Middle East, Khan forswore his foible for playing the lotto. But he apparently momentarily lost his will when he purchased the two scratch tickets during the summer.

A good man: The cashier at the 7-11 where Khan bought his fateful lotto tickets said Khan was a 'gentle' man and a 'nice person' who cared for his family

'It's sad. It's very sad. But I guess it's true when they say that money is the root of all evil,' a cashier at the 7-11 told WGNtv.com.

'He was very nice. I would never think that anybody, especially around him and in the family, would hurt him,' the cashier added.

'He was a nice person, very helpful, very gentle, a hardworking person. I mean, in a short time, he came and managed to have three businesses. That tells you what kind of person he was for his family.'

Khan's widow, for her part, refused to be interviewed by The Tribune about her husband's homicide, other than to say she had cooperated with authorities.

Shabana Ansari, 32, to whom Khan was married for 12 years, told the paper, though that he was, 'extraordinary, nice, kind and lovable.' He was, she said, 'the best husband on the entire planet.'
