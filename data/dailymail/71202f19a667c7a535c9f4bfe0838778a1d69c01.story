This shocking video shows the moment a volunteer fireman tied a stray dog to his car by a rope and dragged it through the city to 'teach the animal a lesson for biting his son'.

Paco, five, was left with four broken legs and ripped holes in the bottom of his paws after struggling to stay on his feet as the car sped through the streets of Salamanca de Monterrico in Central Peru.

He also suffered internal injuries because the man kicked him several times before setting off and dragging him under several cars.

When questioned by police, driver Jose Percy Chiroque Chacon, 45, allegedly claimed that the dog had bitten his son and said he wanted to punish him.

He said he had grabbed the dog and tied it by a rope to his SUV before heading off round the town at high speed, according to media reports.

Paco was saved when local residents spotted the abuse and blockaded Chacon's car, forcing him to stop.

He was then taken to hospital where vets said his pads were completely scraped off and he lost several nails due to the friction.

Outraged neighbours in Salamanca de Monterrico have protested against Chacon's actions, saying the dog is loved in the community and has never bitten anyone else in the past.

One neighbour said: 'Everybody around here knows Paco, he is really friendly and that's why he gets fed a lot and hangs around. Nobody has ever heard of him biting anybody and we very much doubt he bit the man's son.'

The Volunteer Fire Department of Peru revealed that Chacon joined the volunteer unit in 2001 and passed the exam in 2003.

General Commander Gonzalo Lostaunau Silva said the man's actions do not represent the oath firemen take and contradict the values the service men stand for.
