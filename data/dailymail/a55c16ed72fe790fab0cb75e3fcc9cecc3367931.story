The half-brother of a senior Conservative MP is set to deny the sexual abuse of an 11-year-old schoolboy in the 1970s.

Charles Napier, 67, whose brother John Whittingdale represents Maldon, faces one charge of inciting a child to commit gross indecency at a west London school.

His former colleague, ex headteacher Richard Alston, 69, will also stand trial accused of assaulting the same pupil between 1977 and 1982.

The pair were arrested as part of an investigation launched following claims made in parliament about a paedophile ring with connections to the UK establishment.

They appeared in the dock at Southwark Crown Court for a preliminary hearing today.

Peter Zinner, prosecuting, told Southwark Crown Court that the defendants intended to plead not guilty to all matters. 

Mr Zinner said: ‘This case arises out of charges against defendants in relation to the alleged sexual assault and gross indecency on a pupil.

‘The alleged assaults are historical in that they are alleged to have taken place between 1977 and, I believe, 1982’.

Co-accused: Richard Alton, former headteacher at the west London school, faces five sexual abuse charges for allegedly abusing the same pupil

Napier, dressed in a grey suit, blue and white check shirt and red tie, and Alston, wearing a dark grey suit, both spoke only to confirm their names.

Granting the pair bail, Judge Alistair McCreath said they will next appear in court for their plea hearing on October 28.

‘You are both free to go on the same bail conditions you have had up until now.

‘You both know perfectly well your bail conditions, they still apply. 

'Your next appearance before the court will be on October 28’.

Police arrested Napier and Alston last year under Operation Cayacos, a strand of investigation launched following claims by MP Tom Watson in parliament that there was a sex abuse gang with links to the UK establishment.

In 2012 Mr Watson used Parliamentary privilege to claim that a file of evidence used to convict Peter Righton of importing child pornography in 1992 contained 'clear intelligence' of a sex abuse gang.

He wrote to Scotland Yard, who launched criminal investigation Operation Fairbank, which has since spawned two more inquiries - Fernbridge, which is looking at claims linked to the Elm Guest House in Barnes, south west London in the 1980s, and Cayacos.

Napier, also a former teacher, has lived in Sweden and worked for the British council in Cairo and is a respected playwright and theatre director.

Alston is the former head of New Barns School in Toddington, Gloucestershire, which closed in 1992.

Preliminary hearing: Both men spoke only to confirm their name at the hearing at Southwark Crown Court

Napier, of Dorset, is yet to enter a plea to a single charge of inciting a child to commit an act of gross indecency.

Alston, of Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, is yet to enter pleas to five counts of indecent assault and three counts of gross indecency with a child.

The pair will return to court for their plea hearing on October 28.
