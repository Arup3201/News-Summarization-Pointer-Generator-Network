Who Dares Wins: The SAS wants to poach the brightest Cambridge students

The SAS has launched a secret  mission to poach the brightest students at Cambridge University from under the noses of MI5 and MI6.

Regimental sources revealed last night that the Special Air Service has set up a secret base near the university where officers can assess undergraduates’ potential.

At least 20 Cambridge students have already joined the SAS’s training programme this year. Those who pass the punishing regime of endurance marches will receive jungle training before being considered for anti-terrorist and intelligence-gathering operations.

Cambridge University remains a key recruitment centre for the Intelligence Services despite its notoriety for producing traitors who passed vital information to the Soviet Union during the Second World War.

Last night a former SAS officer said the regiment’s move to challenge MI5 and MI6’s ascendancy at Cambridge was an ‘operational imperative’. He added: ‘We need to bring in clever, really versatile young guys who are mustard-keen. You can achieve so much more with recruits of this high calibre. The talent pool at Cambridge is deep and the Intelligence Services have been fishing in it for years. Now we’re giving the spies a run for their money.’

The SAS’s recruitment programme at Cambridge is subject to strict security measures. Student candidates are forbidden to disclose the address of the regiment’s base and must not tell their friends they have been ‘talent-spotted’.

The new recruits are undergoing SAS training on weekends and weekday evenings. They are paid £43 per day, rising to £76 if they are selected. They can complete their academic studies while training.

The SAS’s entry course culminates in three weeks of endurance marches on the Brecon Beacons in Wales. Candidates must carry backpacks weighing 50lb over hundreds of miles and navigate their own course using maps and compasses.

The SAS unit in Cambridge is called C Squadron and belongs to the Army’s 21st Special Air Service Regiment (Reserve). 

'Talent pool': New recruits from the prestigious university are undergoing SAS training during evenings and at weekends

The SAS has historic links with Cambridge University. Its founder, Colonel Sir David Stirling, attended Trinity College before the Second World War. The college was also attended by the quartet of agents believed to have passed top-secret information to the Soviet Union.

Kim Philby, Donald Maclean, Guy Burgess and Anthony Blunt hid their communist sympathies in order to infiltrate British Intelligence and pass on MI5 documents to their masters in Moscow.

The recruitment move by the regiment – whose motto is Who Dares Wins – is a bid to ease a manning crisis. In a letter leaked last year, the Army’s Director of Infantry, Brigadier Richard Dennis, admitted that finding soldiers of sufficient ability to join the SAS was ‘a challenge’.

The shortage of ordinary soldiers applying for selection has led the Ministry of Defence to ring-fence the SAS from the Army’s redundancies programme. Last week The Mail on Sunday revealed that 8,000 personnel will be told in January they are losing their jobs. The MoD declined to comment.
