Maribor boss Ante Simundza hopes to expose the few flaws in unbeaten Chelsea on Tuesday night to record a surprise Champions League Group G win.

The Slovenian side had to qualify for the group stages and have claimed draws against Sporting Lisbon and Schalke in their opening two matches ahead of the double header with the Barclays Premier League leaders.

'Our mentality is to win, to play offensively,' Simundza said.

'We always try to go for a win, but we will certainly not be pushing very, very hard from the beginning without thinking in this match.

'Chelsea is a very competitive team in every minute, in every second of the game.

'It will be very tough to find some flaws. We will do our best to find it and try to use it.

'Chelsea is the favourite not only for our group but also for the Champions League.

'Every team has strengths and weaknesses and Chelsea is no exception, but Chelsea have more strengths than weaknesses.

'We will try to find these weaknesses to achieve a positive result.'

Maribor must shake off a first loss in nine games to prevail at Stamford Bridge.

Two own goals from Aleksander Rajcevic condemned Maribor to a 2-1 defeat to Celje.

Chelsea are without star striker Diego Costa, but Simundza does not expect the Blues to be weakened by the Spaniard's absence.

'Diego Costa is injured, but Diego Costa cannot play alone,' Simundza added.

'Who will play, I don't know, but I'm sure it will be a tough player.'

Defender Marko Suler added: 'I personally was hoping that he played, because I like the challenge.

'Somebody else will come, maybe equally as good. It won't help us at all.'

Maribor reached the group stages at Celtic's expense, but Chelsea are an entirely different proposition.

'It's the hardest opponent so far,' Suler added.

'I wouldn't compare the game with Celtic. I think it's a different level. We have to do our best to compete with a team like Chelsea.

'We know who the favourite is. It would be ridiculous to think the opposite.

'We'll try to make it as hard as possible and surprise if we can.'

Chelsea must take on Maribor without their injured and in-form Spanish striker Diego Costa
