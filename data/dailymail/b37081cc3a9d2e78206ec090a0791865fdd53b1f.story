When it comes to flying, most people hope for a quiet flight without any interruptions from noisy passengers.

But for 178 people flying from Seattle to Hawaii on Wednesday, that illusion was quickly shattered when a man began chanting loudly.

In fact, his chanting was so disturbing that the captain turned the plane around after his fellow travelers complained he was making them nervous.

Alaska Airlines flight 877 was forced to turn around 90 minutes into a journey from Seattle to Hawaii after a passenger began chanting loudly and refused to stop

A spokesman for Alaska Airlines said crew were unable to understand what the man was saying, and couldn't figure out a reason for his behaviour.

Airlines spokesman Nancy Trott added that flight attendants tried to reason with the man, but without any success.

The plane, which initially took off from Sea-Tac airport, landed back at the same airport at 9.30pm where the man was handed over to waiting police officers.

Crew said they tried to reason with the man, but with no success. A spokesman for the airline added that he was handed over to police when he arrived back at Sea-Tac airport, but was not arrested

Authorities said the man did not have to be restrained during the flight, and was not arrested after landing, but was simply told to rebook with another airline.

Flight 877 then continued its journey to Kona, Hawaii, where it landed at 1.16am local time.

Ms Trott added that that pilot made the right decision for the safety of everyone on board.
