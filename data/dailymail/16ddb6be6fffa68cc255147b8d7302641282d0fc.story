Liverpool will not sell the naming rights to Anfield but will consider re-branding their Main Stand.

Last season's Premier League runners-up are on the cusp of getting the final all clear to proceed with the expansion of Anfield - changing the stadium's capacity to 59,000.

Pivotal to this is the £75million expansion of the club's Main Stand.

Liverpool chief commercial officer Billy Hogan says the club will not sell the naming rights to Anfield

Anfield could look like this should its potential 13,000 seats be added to bring its capacity to about 58,800

Liverpool's new Main Stand will be made up of three tiers and could be re-branded in the future

Work is planned to begin next year negotiating a naming rights deal would pay a significant chunk of the construction costs.

Chief commercial officer Billy Hogan said: 'We wouldn’t consider selling naming rights for the stadium as a whole but in terms of the name of the Main Stand that’s something we will look at.

'The new main stand is going to be a big focus for all of us. The process is still ongoing. We’re getting closer to certainty but we’re not there yet.'

Talking to the Liverpool Echo, he added: 'When that certainty arrives from a commercial standpoint we’ll be ready to get to work on that.

'We’ll be looking to bring in a number of new partners. A naming partnership for the stand would make sense.'
