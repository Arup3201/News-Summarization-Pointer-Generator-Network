Marion Beaton, now 105, was forced to wait more than two hours for an ambulance after falling and injuring her arm at home

An injured 105-year-old woman was forced to wait in agony for more than two hours after eight ambulances were diverted to other emergencies.

Marion Beaton fell at her home in Hebburn, South Tyneside, in the middle of the night.

But it was not until her carer came in just before 8am the next day that the centenarian was discovered slumped in her hallway.

The carer dialled 999 immediately, but was forced to wait more than two-and-a-half hours until paramedics arrived at 10.32am.

Ambulance bosses have apologised to Mrs Beaton, but her neighbour George Ludford today criticised the delay in reaching one of the region's oldest residents, branding it 'disgusting'.

The pensioner is recovering at South Tyneside District Hospital after injuring her arm when she fell on May 16.

A spokesman for North East Ambulance Service NHS Trust, said: 'It’s not acceptable that a 105-year-old lady had to wait this long, and we are sorry that we could not get there earlier than we did.

'We were called at 7.57am on May 16 to reports that the lady had fallen.

'She was with a carer. The lady suffered an arm injury, but was breathing and conscious.

'As the patient was deaf, the triaging process took a bit longer than usual. 

'However, it was established that the lady was not in a life-threatening situation, and was classified as a Green 3.

'Between 7.57am and 10.32am, eight different crews were allocated to call - but all were diverted to 'red’ incidents, due to heavy demand.

'During the wait for a vehicle to become free, we kept in touch with the patient.

'Up until 9.44am there had been no change in her condition.

'However, due to the length of time waiting, the call was then upgraded to a Green 2.

'Having dealt with the life-threatening situations, our crew arrived at the scene at 10.32am, and took the lady to South Tyneside A&E for treatment to the arm injury.'

Neighbour George Ludford has branded the delay 'diisgusting'. The North East Ambulance Service NHS Trust has apologised for the delay, explaining the eight ambulance crews were diverted to 'red' 999 calls - the most serious, where patients' lives were in danger
