Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen's 'tacky' festive wonderland which received a barrage of complaints on its first day has re-opened again after a three-day hiatus - but parents remain unconvinced by the 'improvements'.

The Magical Journey in Wishaw, Warwickshire, was billed as 'the most amazing Christmas experience that planet Earth has ever seen'.

But it had to be shut down after a catastrophic flop on its opening day, which saw hour-long queues and children - whose parents had forked out £22.50 to be there - leaving the site in tears.

This pile of tatty-looking presents were left clumsily dumped in the corner of a marquee with a red Santa's outfit left on top at Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen's Magical Journey reopened in Wishaw, Warwickshire

Organisers spent three days loading the Magical Journey with extra fake snow to improve on the opening day

The fake snow had dissolved into mud in some parts during the previous night's downpour

Parents were left equally unimpressed again when they showed up, with some claiming the site still looked 'shoddy'

Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen's 'tacky' festive wonderland which received a barrage of complaints on its first day has re-opened again after a three-day closure - but punters are still unimpressed 

Yet despite tonnes of extra fake snow being slapped on fences and trees - and three days of urgent improvements - parents were left equally unimpressed when they showed up at the attraction again today.

As the curtain was lifted at the site for its second grand opening, hastily-erected partition walls had still not been painted, while over-loaded electrical sockets were also visible in the main entrance.

And a pile of tatty-looking presents lay clumsily dumped in the corner of a marquee with a red Santa's outfit left on top. 

Sheila Denver, a mother-of-two from Sutton Coldfield, described the attraction as 'more tragic than magic'. 

She said: 'It was boring. We whizzed round it in half-an-hour. The first room was especially dull. My kids don't want to read sheets of text.

'I am very disappointed. I really felt sorry for them after reading about Saturday's disastrous opening and thought they'd pull all the stops out but it is, frankly, c**p.'   

Media representatives were banned from attending the second opening day after the high amount of criticism

Sad-looking reindeers were dotted around the site as dozens flocked to give the attraction a second chance

But little effort had been made to hide the incomplete construction of the few tatty stalls inside, built from temporary walls, made of wooden planks, sheet wood and facing

Luckily, the train - which was not working on the opening day - was in full operation at the event today 

The furore broke out after a barrage of complaints on the first day over elves smoking, rubbish being strewn across the paths and wooden pallets covered in plastic tarpaulin left lying around.

The criticism meant the flamboyant TV designer was forced to haul in staff - including an actor playing Santa Claus - for extra training at Belfry Golf Club.

Organisers also spent three days getting the attraction in shape while others tried to manage the PR blunder, which even Mr Llewelyn-Bowen dubbed 'Elfgate'.

Today, organisers attempted to keep criticism at bay by banning journalists from entering the site. 

While there were no long queues as there were on Saturday, families were greeted in the car park by workmen who directed them to the entrance.

After trudging to the main marquee past fake snow which had dissolved into mud during the previous night's downpour, visitors watched as staff scrambled to open on time. 

Staff at the attraction have apparently been retrained since the flop on Saturday

Yet visitors were forced to watch the attraction's elves putting on their make-up in the public toilets as panicking staff scrambled to get open

Parents and children were left waiting outside after it opened 20 minutes late which staff said was because of a road accident on the M42 leaving managers stranded in traffic jams

Wreaths of holly had been carelessly hung over doors partially blocking fire exit signs

Granddad Arthur Johnson, 78, of Warwick, took his three-year-old granddaughter Evie to the attraction. 

The main ride was closed no Saturday as organisers said they needed to make improvements to the experience

Although there are still complaints, some say there has been some improvement since Saturday (pictured)  

He said: 'Some of the stalls in the welcome area weren't complete. They had just thrown them together. I could have done better.

'It was shoddy. The snow was melting into mud and was only covering part of the grass so a huge piece was just left mud. It was very disappointing.

'I saw an actor putting his make-up in the toilets for customers. They weren't ready. It wasn't entertaining, it was boring. It is such a shame.'  

Other parents even complained about health and safety issues.

Father-of-two Lee Woodbridge, 36, said: 'There were workman stood outside by the car park.

'I saw a grounds buggy being carted away by the entrance when I got here. The footpath up was muddy and very even.

'It just didn't seem finished at all. 'It just went from bad to worse. The tour was appalling. There wasn't a lot to see or do. There was nothing exciting or magical about it sadly.'
