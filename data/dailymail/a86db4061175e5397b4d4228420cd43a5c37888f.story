Iker Casillas celebrated 15 years since making his debut for Real Madrid  and could be in line to face rivals Atletico.

It was under John Toshack in a 2-2 draw with Athletic Bilbao in September 1999 that the highly decorated Spanish keeper made his first-team bow.

Casillas, now 33, enjoyed a decade of success for both club and country, captaining Spain to successive European titles in 2008 and 2012, and lifting the World Cup in South Africa four years ago.

Anniversary: Today marked 15 years since Iker Casillas made his debut for Real Madrid 

In the famous white of Real, Casillas has won three Champions League medals, five La Liga titles and two King's Cups.

It was under the management of Jose Mourinho, however, that Casillas lost his place as Madrid's first choice keeper.

Having usually found regularity in the first team, Casillas soon became a rarity.

When Carlo Ancelotti took Mourinho's seat as manager in 2013, the Italian continued to pick Diego Lopez as his goalkeeper in La Liga but used Casillas in Europe.

Despite Lopez's departure to AC Milan this summer, competition for the number one jersey remains high as Ancelotti brought in Keylor Navas, who impressed for Costa Rica in Brazil this summer.

But Ancelotti has reinstated Casillas as his number one and the 55-year-old manager has signalled that he will remain there.

'He (Casillas) has never lost our confidence,' Ancelotti explained in a news conference.

'We congratulated him today for his anniversary with Real Madrid and we wish him the best for the future. We have the same confidence in him as always.'

That confidence may have wavered, however, had it not been for Sergio Ramos' late goal against Atletico in the Champions League final in May.

Real went on to win their tenth European title but were been minutes away from letting it slip away to their local rivals after Casillas' early mistake allowed Diego Godin to put Atletico in front.

Had Diego Simeone's side had a player guarding the back post, Casillas could have found himself in a very different position. They didn't, and Ramos' equaliser may have saved more than Casillas' blushes.

Should the Spaniard feature, it will be his 684th appearance for Real, who is third on the all-time list behind Raul (741) and Manolo Sanchis (710).
