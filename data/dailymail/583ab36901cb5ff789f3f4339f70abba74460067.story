Defence giant BAE Systems today sounded the alarm on the risks of Scottish independence.

The firm, which employs 37,000 people in the UK, warned Scotland remaining in the 300-year-old union offers ‘greater certainty and stability for our business’.

It is the latest major business to highlight the dangers of backing independence in September’s referendum, after similar interventions from Shell, BP and Standard Life.

BAE’s chief executive Ian King had previously refused to be drawn into the debate over the future of Scotland.

But in the firm’s annual report published today, he breaks his silence to back the union.

Writing a review of the year, Mr King said: ‘In September 2014, Scotland will hold an independence referendum.

‘The decision on independence from the UK is a matter for the people of Scotland.

‘However, BAE Systems has significant interests and employees in Scotland, and it is clear that continued union offers greater certainty and stability for our business. 

‘In the event that Scotland voted to 
become independent, we would need to discuss the way forward with the 
Ministry of Defence and UK government, and work with them to deliver the
 best solution in those circumstances.’

The UK government leapt on the remarks as the latest major warning from big business about the impact on jobs in Scotland if it goes it alone.

Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael said: ‘There is an increasing chorus of people from business who know that it is in the interests of the UK and their employees to remain part of the United Kingdom.’

Generator and heating supplier Aggreko has warned Scottish independence would lead to 'years of uncertainty and hiatus' for the business.

Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, Standard Life, Royal Bank of Scotland, the Macfarlane Group and Breedon Aggregates have all listed independence in their risk management sections of their annual reports.

But other high-profile business figures have voiced support for independence, including Willie Walsh, the boss of British Airways' parent company, who said last month that a Yes vote in September could be a 'positive development'.

Ben van Beurden, chief executive of Shell, also warned of the economic risks of Scotland voting in favour of independence.

Mr van Beurden said: ‘We’d like to see Scotland remain part of the United Kingdom.

‘Shell has a long history of involvement in the North Sea – and therefore in Scotland – and we have continued to invest heavily there.’

Lloyds - which has its registered headquarters in Edinburgh - said it had concerns over a potential compliance costs and funding in the event of a ‘yes’ vote at the referendum.

It said: ‘The impact of a yes vote in favour of Scottish independence is uncertain.’

But it added that: ‘the outcome could have a ‘material impact on compliance costs, the tax position and funding for the group’.
