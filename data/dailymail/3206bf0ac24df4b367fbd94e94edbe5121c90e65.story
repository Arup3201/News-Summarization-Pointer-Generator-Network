Ford recently recalled about 98,000 vehicles due to faulty airbags.

But it was one wayward air balloon that was causing the motor giant some strife on Thursday night.

A blimp of a Ford SUV came crashing down into the fan section of the game between the Portland Trail Blazers and the Indiana Pacers at the Moda Center in Portland.

The promotional floating car, which game go-ers are used to seeing soar around the stadium, lost some of its inflation - likely due to a puncture - before falling into Section 209 of the arena.

Deflate: The balloon floated down from the rafters after apparently suffering a puncture

'Now what do we do?': Puzzled staff surround the SUV wondering how to fix the situation

'Will it fit?' Staff attempt to squish the blimp down a staircase to get it out of the arena

Almost there: Many audience members took to Twitter to make fun of the situation

Luckily there were no injuries as the soft structure - usually filled with helium, nitrogen or hydrogen - came crashing down. 

Hilariously, stadium staff who seized the blimp attempted to squish it into a staircase.

The move made for a series of mocking social media posts.

And considering the point of the balloon was publicity for Ford, the incident wasn't exactly positive. 

It didn't affect the fame though, with players not even really noticing what was going on.

The Trail Blazers went on to beat the Pacers 88-82.

Earlier this week, Ford expanded its recall on Takata-issued passenger side airbag inflators at the request of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA), according to CNBC.

The recall targets the 2004-2005 Ford Ranger and 2005-2006 Ford GTs.

It followed several incidents where the airbag inflators installed by Takata proved to be faulty.
