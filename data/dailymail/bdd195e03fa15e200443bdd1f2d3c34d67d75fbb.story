Claims firms that try to make money at the public’s expense will now face fines that could hit millions of pounds.

Ministers announced the penalties yesterday as part of a new regime of rules to crack down on ‘unscrupulous’ claims management companies.

Firms found to have broken the rules will be fined up to one fifth of their annual turnover. For the biggest firms, this could run to millions of pounds.

Claims companies offer to help people get compensation for situations such as injury or mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI).

They pass people’s details on to legal firms, and then charge customers to act as a middle man.

Breaches of the rules include sending out misleading marketing information and wasting time and money by making ‘spurious’ or ‘unsubstantiated’ claims.

Any company that tries to block an investigation by the Claims Management Regulator (CMR), which will impose the fines until the legal ombudsman takes over regulation next month, will also face fines.

Rogue private parking firms are at the centre of a surge in complaints about unfair and extortionate penalty notices.

Complaints to Citizens Advice are up 41 per cent in a year, while the number of people seeking advice via the charity’s website has tripled to 155,000.

CA analysed over 700 calls made to its consumer service in July and September this year and found the average private parking charge was £83.

The parking cowboys, who operate everywhere from hospitals to supermarkets, are aided in the multi-million pound rip-off by a sweetheart deal with the DVLA.

The DVLA has made almost £25million in five years by selling personal details of millions of motorists to the firms.

Justice minister Lord Faulks said: ‘People should not have to have their time wasted by the unscrupulous practices of some claims firms out to make themselves a profit at others’ expense. 

We are making sure they will have to pay the price themselves if they engage in this kind of behaviour.’

The growth of claims management firms has coincided with a surge in bogus ‘cash for crash’ claims, which cost insurance firms more than £2billion a year and add more than £90 to the average car insurance premium, according to industry experts.

A report by MPs this year found firms offer incentives such as free iPads and shopping vouchers to encourage those involved in road accidents to pursue compensation.

In the first three months of this year, the CMR issued 126 warnings to firms, and cancelled two companies’ licences to practise.

Kevin Rousell, head of the CMR, said the new penalties will tackle some firms’ bad behaviour that ‘causes serious inconvenience to the public’, adding: ‘Reducing malpractice will also help to improve the reputation of those firms who do adhere to the rules and provide a good service to consumers.’

In October, the Government announced that the threshold of what is considered a spam call or text would be lowered dramatically.

Watchdog the Information Commissioner’s Office previously had to prove a firm had caused ‘substantial harm’ before it could act, but under new plans they only need to prove ‘annoyance, inconvenience or anxiety’.
