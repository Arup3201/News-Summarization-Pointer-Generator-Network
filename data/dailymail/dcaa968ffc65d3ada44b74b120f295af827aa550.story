BBC star Lord Sugar today called for the axe to fall on the Corporation’s ‘layers of jobsworths’.

The Apprentice frontman said the BBC should axe the bureaucrats and managers who obsess with penny-pinching and instead focus on producing world-class programmes.

The Labour peer used a debate in Parliament complained that the BBC was ‘heavily overstaffed’ by people constantly looking over their shoulders worrying about their critics.

The criticism from one of the most high profile personalities comes after it emerged the BBC plans to bombard viewers with ‘aggressive’ TV adverts to justify the licence fee.

Director General Lord Hall revealed this week that he would be ‘less British’ about defending the £145.50 annual.

But Lord Sugar warned today: ‘Some of the management and the BBC Trust are fixated with cost cutting to try to appease the critics.

‘In adopting this posture they will fall behind by taking their eye off the ball and forgetting what their real aim is, to provide high quality, innovative content and entertainment for the British public,’ he warned.

‘They need to be there at the forefront competing for content instead of being complacent and accepting that their hands are financially tied.’

In a debate in the Lords he said the BBC was ‘heavily overstaffed’ and needed a more commercial approach to its work.

‘The BBC Trust is a complete and utter waste of time,’ he told the Lords. ‘It should be disbanded.’

The Labour peer said the BBC had the technical capability to keep up with competitors but was unable to compete with the ‘ruthlessness’ of the commercial market.

‘They seem hamstrung by external critics constantly referring to the £3.6 billion of licence fee payers funds being spent correctly so consumers get value for money.’

Lord Sugar said that for the licence fee the BBC provided 10 ‘brilliant’ channels of TV, quality news coverage and a ‘magnificent’ array of radio stations - providing ‘exceptional value for money’.

But he said ‘oppression’ from outside influences had created a management constantly looking over its shoulder and forced to defend itself against ‘ridiculous criticism’.

Although the nation should be proud of the BBC, he added: ‘They are heavily overstaffed and there are too many jobsworths - and the organisation is not run in a manner that a commercial organisation should be.’

There was a need for a more commercial approach with a board of directors who were prepared to ‘stand up and be counted’.

Lord Sugar said the Government should not be allowed to interfere in the BBC. ‘Layers of jobsworths need removing and the money saved must be thrown into research and development and programming - and the ability to bid in a competitive market for other entertainment content and talent.’

His comments came in a debate on the contribution of the broadcast media to the UK economy.
