John Carver will use his Holland World Cup stars to inflict yet more St James’ Park misery on Louis van Gaal – and says the Dutchman missed a trick in not taking Daryl Janmaat with him to Old Trafford.

The Manchester United boss has already been on the receiving end of two defeats on Tyneside. First, with Barcelona in 1997, he was the victim of Tino Asprilla’s famous hat-trick in a 3-2 loss in the Champions League group stages. Ten years later he was back with AZ Alkmaar as they were beaten 4-2 in the last 16 of the UEFA Cup, turning the tie with a 2-0 victory back in Holland.

Van Gaal returns with United on Wednesday where he will come up against Janmaat and Tim Krul, two of the players who helped Holland to the semi-finals of the World Cup last summer.

And Carver said: ‘Daryl and Tim have been very helpful in terms of how Van Gaal organises his teams.

‘They actually came to me with the advice, which was nice, and it was a helpful insight.’ He added: ‘I’ve heard his record here isn’t very good and he’s lost twice, hopefully it will be third time unlucky.

‘I was there for that Barcelona game and I wouldn’t mind another night like that.’

Meanwhile, Carver admits that Newcastle’s £5million capture of Janmaat has proved one of the best pieces of business from last summer.

The 25-year-old was an ever-present in Brazil and, with United short of options on the right side of defence, Carver is surprised Van Gaal did not rival them for his signature.

‘I think Van Gaal perhaps had more pressing issues to sort out because let's not forget, when he came in he was talking about playing with three centre-backs,’ said Carver.

‘But even as a wing-back Daryl would have fitted into the system nicely.

‘He's a top, top player. We lost a top player in Mathieu Debuchy but replaced him with an exceptional player. That's good news.

‘He's been the most consistent player for us this season and is a great character. ‘He is a good defender and likes playing on the front foot and he gives you real quality going forward.

‘That's what we saw when we signed him. He's second on the list of assists in the Premier League for defenders and he’s been excellent for us.’ There has been talk of Van Gaal making a move for Janmaat at the end of the season.

And the former Feyenoord star certainly talks highly of his former international boss.

‘He is a fantastic trainer and he has had a magnificent career,’ he said.

‘I have been very fortunate to work with him and I cannot say a bad word about him. ‘He is one of the best trainers I have ever worked with, and if you see how he works tactically, it is great. He always seems to know what to do to win a game.’
