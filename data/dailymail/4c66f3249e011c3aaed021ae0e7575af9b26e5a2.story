Bryan Robson has pinpointed Ander Herrera as one of the key figures in Manchester United's revival.

United are fourth in the table just two points behind second-placed Manchester City. They face their neighbours and defending champions on April 12 during a crucial four game spell that sees them take on Aston Villa, Chelsea and Everton.

However, the manner of their victories against Tottenham and Liverpool in recent weeks has been ominous.

Former United captain Robson recognises that Juan Mata has been winning the bulk of the plaudits but admires the qualities Herrera is showing.

'Ander started off the season well and he’s got a lot of energy,' Robson told ManUtd.com. 'He is always on the move, trying to close people down really quickly. He has got a lot of qualities really, it’s just getting them out of him on a consistent basis. But he has got that in his locker, maybe it’s just taken him and a few of the new signings time to adapt to the Premier League.'

Herrera set up Mata's first goal against Liverpool with an inch-perfect pass and the 25-year-old acquisition from Athletic Bilbao has shown signs of being able to provide a greater tempo to United's play.

'He is quite good defensively and, when I watch him, I can see he has a lot of energy and he does like to get involved' added Robson. 'What I like about him is that, when people are on the ball, he is always on the move to try and receive the pass.'

Herrera was outstanding against Liverpool at Anfield last week and has been in fine form for United
