New Zealander Cam McDermid was skiing off path in the backcountry of Revelstoke Resort, British Columbia, earlier this year when he decided to make a dangerous 60-foot jump.

But the 23-year-old daredevil misjudged the drop and found himself buried, completely paralyzed by the heavy snow and unable to breathe.

‘I dropped off the cliff knowing that there was a small sweet spot to land in but as I took off I realised I had gone too big,’ McDermid recalled.

Over the edge: Skier Cam McDermid attempts an ambitious and dangerous 60-foot jump in Revelstoke Resort, British Columbia, Canada, last February

Ski trip: The 23-year-old New Zealander traveled to Canada with a film crew to capture his exploits on the slopes last winter 

He's gone overboard: The daredevil misjudged the drop and found himself buried and paralyzed by heavy snow

Saved: McDermid was extracted from the snowy trap by his travel companions  

‘I then tried to hot tub myself, which is basically landing on your feet, and then leaning back to displace the impact and minimize injury.’

The professional skier said he was very lucky there was no more snow coming down from above to bury him further during the February 2014 expedition.

McDermid escaped with only minor scrapes and bruises, saying he was grateful his production crew were close by to rescue him.

‘I was extremely grateful that the photographers were in the positions they were otherwise it would have taken them a hell of a lot longer to get to me,’ he said.

What went wrong? The skier said he knew there was a small 'sweet spot' where he was supposed to land, but he overshot it and instead touched down in a huge pile of snow 

Damage control: He then tried to land on his feet while leaning backwards to minimize the risk of injury in a move called 'hot tub' 

Lucky: The Kiwi skier said he was fortunate there was no more snow coming down from above to bury him further

Day job: when he is not busy risking life and limb, the 23-year-old works as an architect 

‘I mean, I was under snow with almost no oxygen for about a minute, so it could have been a lot worse.’

When McDermid is not busy risking life and limp on treacherous slopes, the Christchurch resident works as an architect.
