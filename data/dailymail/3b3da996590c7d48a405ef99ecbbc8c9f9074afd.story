Theft: Roberts took a bag when he got in to the warehouse (file picture)

A thief who burgled a factory returned to the scene of his crime just days later - when he turned up for a job interview.

Robert Anthony Roberts was captured on CCTV leaving Elements Europe, based in Oswestry, Shropshire, with stolen goods.

However he was recognised by one of the managers when he returned to the premises three days later as a candidate for a job there.

He was arrested after the boss called police.

Roberts, 28, pleaded guilty to burglary he appeared before magistrates in Shrewsbury.

The court heard how, on March 12, Roberts entered the factory, on the Mile Oak Industrial Estate, as a trespasser.

He gained access to a washroom and stole a rucksack containing a wallet, £30 cash and ID cards.

When staff realised the items had been taken the firm’s production manager Nick Davies checked CCTV footage.

It showed Roberts leaving the washroom with the rucksack accompanied by a Staffordshire bull terrier-type dog.

John Barnett, prosecuting, said it was shortly after the burglary that Mr Davies had been carrying out job interviews at the firm.

When he recognised one of the candidates as the man he had seen on CCTV footage he contacted the police.

Roberts, of Newtown, Powys, Wales, admitted the burglary and told police he did it to feed his £40-a-day heroin addiction.

Martin Rogerson, defending, said Roberts had suffered from an 'appalling heroin habit' which was so bad he had lost his job as a roofer working for his uncle.

He added that, at that time, Roberts had been living in a room in Oswestry and had been walking around the industrial estate looking for work when he got into the room and helped himself to the bag.

The court was also told that, since the burglary, Roberts had made efforts to turn his life around.

Magistrates heard how, for the first time since childhood, the defendant had been reconciled with his father.

Mr Rogerson added that Roberts had - with the support of his family - got himself clean of heroin by completing a self-detoxification programme at his father's home.

While the ordeal had been a 'dreadful' experience for the defendant's family, Mr Rogerson added, it was one that had ultimately got Roberts clean of drugs.

It emerged during the hearing that a warrant for Roberts' arrest was outstanding, relating to the non-payment of fines.

The offence had resulted in Roberts being in breach of suspended sentence order which carries a 45-day custody sentence.

However, Mr Rogerson argued that, having finally got clean of drugs and now living and working with his father in a supportive stable environment, prison would be the worst place Roberts could be sent.

Magistrates allowed Roberts’ suspended sentence order to continue, but ordered him complete a 12-month community order, with 40 hours of unpaid work, £85 costs and £63 compensation.
