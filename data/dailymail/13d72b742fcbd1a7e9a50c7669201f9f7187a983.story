Caught in the act: This is Julio Mario Galeano, 31, - who has been identified by police in East Hampton as the officer caughter having sex with a meter maid inside an exclusive property in the town

The mother of the East Hampton police officer caught having sex with a meter maid inside a luxury village cottage has defended her 31-year-old son - calling him a 'good boy' who still lives at home with her.

Authorities in the exclusive Hamptons vacation spot identified Julio Mario Galeano as the local cop facing disciplinary action and potential criminal charges for trespassing the property to conduct a tryst with the part-time traffic control officer.

Galeano has had his badge and gun confiscated after three guests arrived at the home of Manhattan designer J. Arthur Dunnam on December 30 to find the East Hampton officer and the 20-year-old woman according to police called to the property.

It is alleged that Jennifer Rosa, the part-time traffic cop had access to the house because she was also a part-time cleaner for Dunnam.

However, while they are currently under investigation for trespassing, Dunnam has yet to file any charges according to a press release from the police put out on Friday and seen by the New York Post.

His mother understandably said her son was not a bad egg and that he still lives with her around one mile from East Hampton police headquarters.

Galeano immigrated with her mother to the United States from Colombia at the age of 12 and is East Hampton's only Hispanic cop.

In fact he was named 2012 'Officer of the Year' after he heroically caught a man having sex with an underage girl after he saw a van rocking while he was parked.

'Itâ€™s a good job and a great way to help the community,' he told the East Hampton Patch Web site, adding that he hoped to serve 'as a role model.'

Galeano is currently in Colombia and is due to return on Sunday.

The maid was fired by the East Hampton police board on Friday and was identified by Patch as Jennifer Rosa, but efforts to reach her were unsuccessful.

Police have confirmed are investigating the 'trespassing incident' on December 30 at the home in Talmage Lane, which is owned by Arthur Dunnam of design firm Jed Johnson Associates.

The pair were allegedly caught when three guests arrived at the home from Georgia, having been invited by Dunnam to spend New Years weekend at his place.

The three startled visitors quietly left and called in a trespass complaint to police.

The police that responded were said to be startled by who they found.

'Upon arrival, they located two suspects inside the residence that were not authorized to be there,' the East Hampton Village Police incident report said.

Police called Dunnam, who said he did not wish to press charges.

He did confirm the authorities that no one, other than the guests, were meant to be in the house.

The cops are being investigated for trespassing in the home for a 'sexual encounter', the East Hampton Star reported.

Sitting on a third of an acre, the two-story shingled cottage with bay windows and a semi-detached garage is secluded from the street by a substantial row of manicured privet.

Dominy Lane, a dirt road by the police and firehouse complex on Cedar Street, leads nearly to the rear of the property.
