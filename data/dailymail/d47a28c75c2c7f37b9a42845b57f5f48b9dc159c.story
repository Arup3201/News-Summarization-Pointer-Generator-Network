Police are investigating the alleged rape of a three-year-old girl at a private international school in the Indian city of Bangalore.

According to the complaint, the girl was crying when her mother picked her from the school and initially said that someone beat her up.

The mother noticed wounds on the girl's private parts and she then admitted that she had been sexually abused by 'an uncle in school'.

Police are examining CCTV footage for clues and are awaiting a report on the child's medical condition after she was admitted to hospital.

'The preliminary medical report revealed injuries to her private parts. The girl is in shock. We will question her on Wednesday,' a police officer told The Times Of India.

Senior police officers visited the school campus on Tuesday night and interrogated six male teachers. No arrests or detentions were made.  

A criminal case has been registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act 2012 and under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code for rape.

The school has eight campuses in Bangalore, besides branches in Mumbai, Pune and Hyderabad.

The incident is the third case in four months of a young female student being allegedly sexually assaulted on a Bangalore school campus.

Statistics from the National Crime Records Bureau in India for 2013 show one rape was reported every 21 minutes

In August it was revealed that an eight year-old girl had been allegedly sexually assaulted by her 63-year-old teacher over a period of time.

A month earlier the 'gang-rape' of a six-year-old girl at Vibgyor High School provoked public outrage, with many accusing the school of not handling the situation properly.

In the wake of the demonstrations, police came up with elaborate guidelines for schools to better secure the campus for children.

Several schools have complained about the guidelines and claim they will drain them of resources. 

The guidelines include the installation of CCTV cameras on campus and GPS on school buses.

Scrutiny of sexual violence has grown in India since the 2012 gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student on a Delhi bus.

The crime sparked days of protests and forced the government to introduce tougher anti-rape laws, including doubling prison terms for rapists to 20 years and the death penalty. The law also made it a crime for officers to refuse to open cases when complaints are made.

But the law appears to have failed to act as an adequate deterrent. Statistics from the National Crime Records Bureau for 2013 show one rape was reported every 21 minutes.
