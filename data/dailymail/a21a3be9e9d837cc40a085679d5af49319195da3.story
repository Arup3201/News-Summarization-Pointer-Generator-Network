The FBI are hunting a bank robber they have dubbed the 'Chit Chat Bandit' as he continues to chat up the tellers while stealing from them.

The man has now targeted two banks in the San Diego area in two days and on both ocassions has fled the scene on the crime on a BMX-style bike.

Investigators say even as the cash is being handed over, he continues to chat to the female tellers to lull them into a false sense of security and to make it look as though he is a regular customer.

The man dubbed the Chit Chat Bandit, who is being hunted by the FBI after robbing two banks in the space of two days in the San Diego area 

The man was first captured on CCTV on Wednesday, November 26, when he entered the Wells Fargo bank on Girard Avenue in La Jolla, California.

He then walked over to the counter and handed the female teller a note demanding all of the money in her cash drawer.

The robber also made a verbal demand for cash before engaging in small talk with her so he appeared like a normal customer.

Then two days later after Thanksgiving, he targeted another Wells Fargo branch inside the Vons store on Camino Canada in El Cajon.

Again he walked over to the counter and demanded money from the teller, and while she was collecting it, he also asked another employee for money.

In the first robbery, the man targeted the Wells Fargo bank on Girard Avenue in La Jolla, California, pictured, where he demanded money from the teller but continued to chat her up while robbing the branch

He carried on talking to them while he was given the cash and then exited the store before making his getaway on a small green BMX bicycle.

No injuries have been reported at either of the robberies and no weapon has been displayed.

The FBI are now chasing down the man and are offering a $1,000 cash reward.

He is described as white, in his mid-thirties of around 170 pounds and approximately five foot ten inches tall with a slender build and blonde with facial hair.

In the first robbery he was wearing dark sunglasses, an orange reflector vest with a long-sleeved, dark tan shirt underneath.

In the second raid he wore a dark baseball cap, dark shirt and light coloured pants.

Anyone with information is asked to contact the FBI.
