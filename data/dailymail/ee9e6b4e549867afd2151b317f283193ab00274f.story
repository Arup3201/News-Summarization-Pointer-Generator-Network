Iraj Parvizi, 48, is suing a London casino for his £10m losses, over claims 
he was the victim of a sting involving card sharps and masseuses

A wealthy financier is suing a London casino for his £10million losses, claiming an elaborate sting involving card sharps and masseuses.

Iraj Parvizi played in a weekly private game for millionaire high-rollers, held at London’s prestigious Les Ambassadeurs casino – which featured in the James Bond film Dr No.

The game, in which players regularly bet six-figure sums, was attended by Arab sheikhs and footballers including ex-Arsenal player Nicklas Bendtner and former England striker Teddy Sheringham.

Mr Parvizi, 48, claims a game in which he lost £185,000 in one night was undermined by a conspiracy between professional poker players out to take him for every penny he had.

The dispute began when Les Ambassadeurs sued Mr Parvizi, after he cancelled cheques to the casino for the £185,000 worth of chips used during that night’s game.

Mr Parvizi counter-sued, alleging in documents filed with the High Court that the casino failed to stop ‘collusion and cheating’ and claiming for £10million.

The sum represents all the money he lost over nearly four years of games, which Mr Parvizi says were all tainted.

He claims that two professional players were working together, encouraging him to bet as much as possible.

They would then split their winnings, according to Mr Parvizi.

Mr Parvizi also raised concerns over a troupe of masseuses brought in to help players relax during the long and tense sessions.

He accused Craig Stevens, who oversaw the poker game on behalf of the casino, of employing the girls to be ‘under his instruction’.

Legal documents claim that ‘two or three’ masseuses ‘attended on each game, circulating between the players (from which positions they would be able to look at and communicate players’ hands)’.

On the night of the disputed game Mr Parvizi claims masseuses that he had not seen before, had ‘opportunities for inconspicuous inspection and signalling of players’ cards to others’.

Les Ambassadeurs – whose slogan is ‘where there is no apology for privilege’ – called Mr Parvizi’s claims against it ‘embarrassing’ in papers filed with the High Court.

Lawyers for the casino added that it was an ‘accepted poker strategy’ for stronger players to encourage weaker players to bet more.

They added that the casino has no knowledge of any strategy that took place during the game.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, one of the high-rollers who played with Mr Parvizi dismissed his claims as absurd.

‘No-one would need to cheat to beat Iraj. We’re professionals and he’s terrible, so it’s like Brazil versus San Marino in football.

‘As a professional player, you sometimes need credit and you rely on your reputation. I’d rather lose than collude.’

He added that regular players would have considered the £185,000 that Mr Parvizi lost that night to be ‘nothing’.

Les Ambassadeurs, with its prestigious location at Hamilton Place, overlooking Hyde Park, is owned by Indonesian tobacco billionaire Putera Sampoerna and is known for attracting the super-rich.

Mr Parvizi, a financier who is based in Dubai, declined to comment on the lawsuit. He denied last year a charge of insider dealing and is due to face trial in September.

Les Ambassadeurs declined to comment and Mr Stevens could not be reached.
