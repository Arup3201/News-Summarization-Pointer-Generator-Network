Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords will resign from Congress this week, a year after she was shot in the head while meeting constituents in Tucson.

Giffords made the announcement in a YouTube video posted Sunday afternoon in which she explained in a halting, sometimes slurred, voice that she must continue healing before she can represent residents of her district again.

'I have more work to do on my recovery so to do what is best for Arizona I will step down this week,' she said.

However, she vowed to step back into public life when her rehabilitation is complete.

'I'm getting better every day. My spirit is high. I will return and we will work together for Arizona and this great country.'

The two-minute video features images from her recovery, which has captivated the country.

It also shows images of the vibrant 41-year-old Congresswoman before the attack, her wavy blond locks a contrast to the close-cropped style she has worn since undergoing several emergency brain surgeries.

'A lot has happened over the past year. We cannot change that,' she says.

'I don't remember much from that horrible day but I will never forget the trust you placed in me to be your voice.'

As her final act as congresswoman in her district, Giffords will finish the meet-and-greet political event today that erupted in the deadly spree.

Giffords' office says the 
congresswoman will finish the Congress On Your Corner event. In a 
private gathering, she will meet with some of the people who were at the
January 8, 2011 event in a Safeway parking lot when a gunman killed six 
people and wounded 13 others, including Giffords.

Those attending will include some of the wounded, others who helped them, and people who subdued the attacker.

Giffords will also visit a family assistance centre that was set up after she was seriously wounded.

The announcement of her last congressional duties came after President Barack Obama praised 
Representative Giffords, calling her an 'inspiration' and 'the very best
of what public service should be.'

'I'm getting better every day. My spirit is high. I will return and we will work together for Arizona and this great country.'

Mr Obama recognised Giffords for her 
'dedication to fairness, a willingness to listen to different ideas, and
a tireless commitment to the work of perfecting our union.'

He says Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, 'have taught us the true meaning of hope in the face of despair' and 'determination in the face of incredible odds.'

The president says the congresswoman's 'cheerful presence will be missed in Washington.'

The congresswoman's decision to step down from her seat opens up a wide-open race to fill her spot in her southeastern Arizona district.

It will set up not one but two entire elections cycles, with new congressional lines in each thanks to congressional redistricting.

Governor Jan Brewer will call a special primary election sometime in April and then a general election in June to fill Gifford's seat in the 8th Congressional District. That will be followed by a regular primary and general election for the new 2nd District.

Recovering: Giffords and Kelly made a much-celebrated appearance at a memorial marking the one-year anniversary of the shooting spree

The
three-term Democrat was widely considered a shoo-in for re-election 
because of her tragic shooting at a Tucson constituent meeting a year 
ago.

On January 8, 2011, 
Jared Lee Loughner opened fire on Giffords and several people she was 
meeting at a Safeway grocery store outside Tucson, authorities said.

Six people, including federal judge John Roll and a nine-year-old girl were killed.

The attack left Giffords fighting for her life after she suffered significant brain trauma from a gunshot wound.

She
has recently begun appearing in public after being released from the 
hospital, including a much-celebrated appearance in Congress August 1.

Giffords recently appeared at a memorial marking the one-year anniversary of the shooting spree.

The Congresswoman, who had to re-learn how to walk, stepped onto the podium at the event and recited the pledge of allegiance while an adoring crowd chanted her name.

Though she has made a dramatic recovery since doctors put her in a drug-induced coma directly after the shooting, her resignation from Congress cannot be considered a dramatic surprise.

In an interview with ABC News in November, Giffords said she would not return to work until she was fully recovered.

Her public appearances have revealed that she has trouble forming sentences and communicating as she once did.

Giffords' speech therapist has said the Congresswoman still has a lot of work to do before she has fully recovered.

If she had stayed in office, she would have faced the possibility of having to defend her seat in the November election.

The moderate Democrat narrowly won a third term after a hard-fought re-election campaign in 2010.

Her resignation will lead to a special election in June to fill her seat until the general election in November.

Some have speculated her husband Mark Kelly, who has been her constant companion during her recovery, will run for her seat.

Kelly, a NASA astronaut, commanded the space shuttle Endeavor's final mission into space in May.

If he does run, he will have access to the $875,000 Giffords has in her campaign coffers.

The resignation garnered praise for Giffords from both side of the political aisle.

'Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords has been a true bright star - a dynamic and creative public servant. Gabbyâ€™s message of bipartisanship and civility is one that all in Washington and the nation should honour and emulate,' House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement.

Republican House Speaker John Boehner offered: 'I salute Congresswoman Giffords for her service, and for the courage and perseverance she has shown in the face of tragedy. She will be missed.'
