Eight parachutists have died after their plane caught fire and crashed at an airfield in Finland.

The bodies of eight victims were found among the badly burned wreckage of the Comp Air 8 kit plane, which started disintegrating in the sky above Jamijarvi airfield - 45 miles east of the city of Pori.

However three people - two parachutists and the pilot - escaped with only minor injuries after leaping from the stricken plane in mid-air and using their parachutes to glide safely to the ground.

Location: The plane started disintegrating in the sky above Jamijarvi airfield - 45 miles north east of the city of Pori. Jamijarvi airfield is one of the most popular in Finland for leisure and training flights

Officials confirmed that all 11 people on board were accounted for, with eight dying and the three that survived being treated for minor injuries.

A rescue helicopter and ambulance attended the scene shortly after 6pm yesterday afternoon.

One of the survivors is understood to be the pilot of the plane, with police saying all those involved in the incident were residents of the local area.

The eight victims were all found among the burnt out wreckage of the Comp Air 8 - a small aircraft popular with parachutists.

Detective Superintendent Petri Kangas said investigators didn't know the cause of the accident, only that 'apparently some parts fell off the plane before it crashed.'

The aircraft was travelling at a relatively high altitude of more than 10,000 feet 
before the crash.

At this altitude it is likely the parachutists were only minutes away from making their jump.

Witnesses said the plane appeared to run into engine trouble in mid-air and started making 'abnormal' noises before crashing and bursting into flames.

According to police reports, the witnesses added that in the moments before the crash they saw 'three parachutes detach from the plane which then came down in a steep angle'.

Jamijarvi airfield is one of the most popular in Finland for leisure and training flights.
