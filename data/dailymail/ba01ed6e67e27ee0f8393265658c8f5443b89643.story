A Delta flight was forced to make an emergency landing at John F. Kennedy International Airport on Wednesday evening after it experienced problems with the hydraulic system.

Delta Flight 886 from Atlanta was scheduled to land at LaGuardia Airport, but on final descent, a warning light in the cockpit indicated a possible problem with the plane's hydraulic system which controls the brakes.

The flight was then diverted to JFK as a precaution because it has longer runways then LaGuardia.

The plane landed uneventfully, but while taxing, it went into the grassy area off the runway, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said.

The plane was moving slowly at the time and none of the 118 passengers and 5 crew members on board were injured.

Passengers said they were told they needed to land at JFK because it had a longer runway, which would better ensure a safe landing.

‘It was a little scary,’ passenger Bhatia Tasneem told NBC4. ‘I have to admit, my heart started racing a little bit, and I was worried about what may or may not happen.’

The Delta plane was a McDonald Douglas MD88 similar to the one pictured

‘You can't help but have that question when something like this happens,’ she said.

Victor Chemptob said the landing felt normal ‘up until the very end, when it felt like stopping short, someone slamming on the brakes.’

The Port Authority Police Crash, Fire, Rescue Unit responded to the scene. The passengers were bused to Terminal 2. Delta said those who needed to get to LaGuardia Airport will be bussed there.

The hydraulics system controls the brakes, flaps and steering of the plane.

The FAA and Port Authority say they're investigating.
