Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao have gained permission from the Spanish FA to wear 'nationalist' kits for their clash on Saturday, leaving some in Madrid fuming.

The Blaugrana requested that they be allowed to wear their ‘senyera’ strip from last season, which features red and yellow stripes to match the Catalan flag, as they celebrated their national day on Thursday.

The LFP, Athletic, and the referee have all given permission for Barcelona to wear the kit, which will be the first time they have ever worn it at the Nou Camp.

The celebratory day, which is an annual festival which takes place on September 11, commemorates the defeat of Catalonia during the War of the Spanish Succession.

National day of Catalonia was first celebrated in 1886 and an annual festival has taken place ever since.

Catalan nationalists often use the event to call for their independence from mainland Spain.

Athletic, have been allowed to play in green shirts with white shorts and red socks, which matches the flag of the Basque Country, the Ikurrina.

Barcelona insist that they are not mixing football and politics, with the move designed to be a commemoration of a historical event, the 300th anniversary of the fall of the city to the French in 1714.

But Alfredo Relano, editor of AS, a Madrid-based daily newspaper, was unimpressed.

He wrote: 'Some at Barca say they don’t want to politicise the match. Well, if that was the club’s intention, Barca would play as Barca and Athletic as Athletic, as they’ve done for a century, and not Barca as Catalonia and Athletic as the Basque Country.'

Barcelona players were involved in various events on Thursday to mark Catalonia’s national day.

Gerard Pique, Xavi and president Josep Bartomeu were among those who took to the streets of the city to join in the celebrations.

They were part of the giant V shape formed between two main roads in the city, Avenida Diagonal and Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes.

Around 1.8million Catalans, out of a total 6m in the region were said to have taken part, with the letter symbolising the desire to vote for independence.
