When Lydia Rose Bright left TOWIE, fake tan and James Argent behind a few years ago, she set her sights on becoming a serious fashion designer.

And it seems that the former reality TV star's dreams have become a reality as her eponymous clothing line has been snapped up by Asos and River Island.

Lydia, 23, has unveiled her SS14 range full of vintage-inspired dresses, lace separates and sexy jumpsuits and it will be sold in-store and online.

Speaking to MailOnline about her new range, Lydia said: 'I always do the same process when I come to designing my new collection.

'I start by scouring the vintage shops, and buying lots of different pieces that I really love, and use these as a starting off point for inspiration for the collection.

'I particularly like the 50s era and really like to have that showing through with my collections.

'I also did a lot of homework studying the SS14 catwalks, looking at key trends for the season and taking inspiration from some of my favourite designers.

'I feel with this collection I’ve taken a lot of inspiration from Marchesa, Alice + Olivia, Erdem and Christian Dior.'

While she and best friend Lauren Goodger made fake nails and fake tan their own on the reality TV show, Lydia has been quietly reinventing her style, which she hopes will be reflected in her designs.

She said: 'I always try and keep my collection looking very girly, very feminine and sophisticated as I kind of feel that’s the stamp of my collection, but I do try and add a little sex appeal to the looks, just in a slightly more subtle way.

'So either a key-hole back, or an off-the-shoulder style. I try to inject a little sex appeal in a subtle way through the detailing.'

Her fellow Essex girls are always supportive of her designs but Lydia has her heart set on one fashionista in particular.

'Whenever I see any celebrity in my designs it’s a massive sense of achievement but the one I would really love to see in my dresses is Sarah Jessica Parker - that would be my dream as she is my style icon,' she said.

Passion for fashion: Lydia has left her reality TV days behind to focus on designing
