A car restorer father has come together with his salesman son to turn rust to riches.

The strength of their combined reputation, restoring luxury cars and selling them, has business booming for the father-son duo.

But to make more money expanding their London business, they’re first going to have to lay down some serious money on renovating a new site to launch their first dealership location.

Lance McCormack owns Romance of Rust - one of Britain’s best car restoration businesses.

Mr McCormack was trained as a traditional panel beater, manufacturing the parts by hand.

After working to manufacture Rolls Royce parts, Mr McCormack used his skills to his advantage and became the go-to man for luxury car repairs.

His son Merlin hasn’t come from such humble beginnings - instead trading off his father’s good reputation as a high quality panel beater for over 30 years - and runs car brokerage firm Duke of London.

With business booming, Merlin has found a showroom right next to his father's car restoration business. 

He's hoping that the expensive move will add further credibility to his already successful business venture.
