'Forced out': Stephen Clements, 51, is suing Lloyds Banking Group for £1 million in lost earnings

A senior Lloyds executive was forced out of his job because he blew the whistle on 'shocking' failures in the bank’s IT systems that would have cost £200 million to fix, a tribunal has heard.

Stephen Clements, 51, the former head of the business continuity at Lloyds Banking Group, alleges there was a 
deliberate cover-up to stop the flaws being dealt with due to the cost of repairing the problem and the potential damage to the bank's reputation.

Mr Clements claims he discovered 'startling' failures in the bank’s IT Disaster Recovery back-up system that left the bank vulnerable to failures that could bring it down.

The problems were so severe they threatened to 'destabilise the British economy', it was said today.

But he said that when he tried to flag up the worrying deficiencies to his boss last March he was told to 'burn the paper' it was written on and the issue was effectively buried.

Mr Clements says he was forced from his job as the senior executive in charge of protecting Lloyds’ systems from crises just four months after raising his concerns.

He had already been warned he could be moved to another post, and he alleges the unwanted move was because of his age and the boss’s desire to replace him with a woman. The bank denies his allegations.

The father-of-three from Bristol, who earned £130,000 a year in pay and benefits, is suing the bank for £1 million in lost earnings. He alleged whistleblowing and sex and age discrimination.

In documents submitted to the Central London Employment Tribunal, the 51-year-old said he was 'startled' to discover that only a third of the bank’s systems had undergone crucial testing, leaving 'very serious gaps in our ability to recover critical IT systems'.

Mr Clements said the failure to undertake the risk assessments could have a potentially catastrophic impact on the country’s economy.

He said the impact would dwarf a similar glitch at the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) last June that left millions of customers unable to access their accounts.

He said: 'The LBG issues are much bigger and could potentially send the bank out of business, thereby destabilising the British economy. I raised a really serious concern.'

However, when he told his boss Jonathon Shawcross, director of group security and fraud, about his fears in an email in March 2012, he claimed the executive 'took great exception' and told him to 'burn the paper and never bring it out again’.

'Failings': Mr Clements claims to have discovered deficiencies in Lloyds Banking Group's IT back-up system

Mr Clements added: 'Effectively this issue was buried. Jonathon had responsibility for ensuring these [assessments] were carried out. The statistic that only 37 per cent of systems had a BIA (business impact assessment) completed is both startling and shocking.

'It was the responsibility of information risk to ensure that these essential risk assessments were being carried out and it had failed to do so.'

Mr Clements claims he repeatedly wrote to his manager urging him to tell other senior executives of the urgent need to strengthen these security tests.

But when he confided his fears in another senior employee at Lloyds, Mr Clements claims he was told that top executives at the state bailed out bank were engaged in a cover up because they feared the cost of rectifying the problem would cost a staggering £200million.

In his statement he said Cheryl Newton, a peer of Mr Shawcross and equally responsible for IT Disaster Recovery at Lloyds, told him of the cover up.

He said she 'told me that if she had escalated this issue up the line, she 'would lose [her] job’ because Mark Fisher (Director of Operations), Alan Peacock (IT Service Delivery Director) and Jonathan wanted the problem 'covered up’, not only because of the potential cost to remedy the problems (over £200m) but also because of the extensive damage to the public’s confidence in the bank.'

Potential: Mr Clements said the impact would dwarf a similar glitch at the Royal Bank of Scotland last June

A Lloyds employee for more than 20 years, Mr Clements was a successful executive with a string of achievements to his name.

But he claims his job turned sour in 2011 and believes his boss was scheming to out him from his job so he could give it to a woman, Nicola Nicols, who Mr Shawcross had worked with at RBS.

Mr Clements alleges he was ordered by Mr Shawcross to place Miss Nicols as his possible successor on an internal document - despite major concerns about her lack of experience.

In his statement he said: 'In April 2011 Jonathon instructed me to include Nicola’s name against my name/role in the 0-2 years column.

'I replied that I did not think she was ready to take over in my role within that time. Jonathan leant across the table and said aggressively 'I will be the judge of that’. That was the end of the conversation and her name was duly included.'

Nine months later in his yearly assessment meeting on January 5 2012, Mr Clements claims his boss subjected him to a litany of ageist comments and told him: 'It is difficult for you because you are not 25 anymore' and 'you have been here too long'.

He claims Mr Shawcross then told him he wanted to remove him from his post within the next two months and get in a 'fresh pair of eyes' to take up his job.

Following two failed grievance hearings against his boss, Mr Clements resigned in July last year.Lloyds and Mr Shawcross strongly deny any wrongdoing and insist that Mr Clements was treated properly.

In a statement Mr Shawcross said: 'I categorically deny any suggestion that I have treated Steve detrimentally on the basis of his gender or his age and there is no truth in Steve’s suggestion that I ought to replace him with Nocola Nicol.

'I further strongly refute any suggestion that Steve has been treated to his detriment by me or Lloyds in any way as a result of either raising a grievance, filing litigation or raising concerns surrounding the ITDR report.

'I am very regretful that the situation has come to this.'

A Lloyds banking group spokesman said: 'We take the continuous provision of service to our customers very seriously.

'As this is the subject of an ongoing employment tribunal it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.'

The tribunal continues.
