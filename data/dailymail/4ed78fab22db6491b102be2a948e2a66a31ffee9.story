Portugal winger Nani has returned to Sporting Lisbon on loan after seven years at Manchester United.

The 27-year-old moves back to his native country on a season-long loan as part of a deal that sees Marcos Rojo go the other way in a £16million move.

Sir Alex Ferguson signed Nani from Sporting in 2007 for a fee in the region of £20million.

But the winger fell out of favour at Old Trafford, making just 13 appearances last season for his club and only scoring once, against Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League in November.

Nani featured in Manchester United's 2-1 defeat by Swansea in their opening Premier League game on Saturday, coming off the bench to replace Javier Hernandez at half-time.

But new manager Louis van Gaal was willing to let the Portugal star leave and rejoin his former club in an attempt to resurrect his career.

Nani joins the likes of Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra among the high-profile players to leave Old Trafford this summer.
