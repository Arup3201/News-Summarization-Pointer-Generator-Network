New mother: Sarah Sandell named her son Noah after she battled through flooded roads to get to hospital for the birth

A pregnant teacher who had to battle through the floods to get to hospital has named her baby Noah.

Sarah Sandell, 31, of Skeeby, North Yorkshire, desperately needed to get to hospital after her waters broke on Monday evening.

However, she and her husband Kevin were left struggling, trapped by floodwater which had closed many of the surrounding roads.

Police had closed the main bridge leading out of the village when cars became stranded in the fast-rising floodwater.

Mr Sandell, 30, said: 'I had gone out to offer help because cars were getting stuck near the bridge.

'When I came back at about 8pm, I found another puddle on the floor after my wife’s waters broke.

She had telephoned the Friarage Hospital in Northallerton, where we were scheduled to be going, but they told her they were full and she would have to go to the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough.'

The couple, who are both science teachers at Richmond School, knew other roads were already closing, so had to find a route that was not flooded.

Newborn: Parents Sarah and Kevin Sandell had shortlisted four names for their newborn son, but battling through floodwater to get to hospital, they knew they had to settle on Noah

Mr Sandell added: 'Luckily we got onto the A1 from Brompton-on-Swale before it was closed and we managed to use the A66 from Darlington to Middlesbrough just in the nick of time before that road was closed.'

Noah was born a fit and healthy baby weighing 8lbs 9oz. Mr Sandell said: 'Noah had been in our top five boy names, but the flooding just put the icing on the cake for it.'

Noah, which is the 15th most popular 
boy’s name in the England and Wales according to Office for National 
Statistics figures, is of Hebrew origin and has meanings such as 
‘comfort’ and ‘peaceful’.

The
story of Noah's Ark appears in the Old Testament of the Bible in the 
Book of Genesis, telling how Noah builds an ark to save himself, his 
family and a representation of the world's animals.

When
all the animals are on board, a flood is sent by God - who is angry at 
the wickedness in the world - and flood waters rise.

Once the waters 
have subsided, Noah and the animals safely leave the ark.

Parts of north England have experienced the most intense September storm in 30 years.

Heavy
rainfall early in the week have caused flooding across the country, 
with the most severely affected regions being the North East of England 
and Wales, where the Environment Agency still has 25 flood warnings.

Parts of the Midlands and the South West are also at risk of flooding.

Near Wrexham, North Wales, one couple were found drowned in a river, possibly because they had tried to save their dog.

Alicia Williams, 25, who has a young daughter, and boyfriend David Platt, also 25, were found dead on Wednesday by the River Clywegg.

Around 570 properties have been flooded across England and Wales and hundreds of roads have been submerged by flood waters.

While some areas continue to be submerged, the Environment Agency said river levels had now peaked and are expected to fall over the weekend.
