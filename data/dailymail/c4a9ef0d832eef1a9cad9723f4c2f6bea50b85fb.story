It’s not quite up to the standard of a royal palace, but the Lindo Wing at St Mary’s boasts every conceivable comfort for a mother-to-be.

There is even a specially compiled wine list should patients and their guests wish to enjoy a glass of champagne to celebrate their baby’s arrival.

The private maternity facility is a favourite with the royal family. William and Harry were born there, as were their cousins Peter and Zara Phillips.

Time to celebrate: Should the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge wish to toast the arrival of their eagerly-anticipated first child with a flute of champagne they can choose from a specially compiled wine list

The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and Prince and Princess Michael of Kent also chose it for the births of their children.

Last year, it underwent an extensive refurbishment and now provides what it 
boasts is the ‘highest quality of care’ for patients experiencing both 
‘straightforward’ and complex pregnancies.

There are individual birthing rooms and a birthing pool. Each room has 
satellite TV, radio, internet access, daily newspapers and a safe.

A separate team of ‘catering staff’ offer an extensive daily menu with a comprehensive wine list.

Postnatal rooms come with a fully reclining chair for partners who want to stay. They will receive a free breakfast in the morning and visiting hours are flexible.

The bill for delivery is staggered per 24 hours –with a quick, natural 
birth costing £4,965. Staying in a suite – as the Duchess will do – 
would cost an additional £1,000 plus per night on top of that, meaning 
the delivery could cost up to £10,000.

Renowned: The private maternity facility has a fleet of maternity support workers and nursery nurses on hand to support new mothers

The Lindo Wing has a team of maternity support workers and nursery nurses who can offer advice and reassurance to all new mothers staying there.

It provides expert consultant-led obstetric, neonatal care and anaesthetist care with 24-hour access to Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust’s state-of-the-art maternal and foetal specialist services.

Part of the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, St Mary's is described as having 'modern, consultant-led world-class care'. 

The hospital also has a special care section, The Winnicott Baby Unit.

In 2006, William visited the refurbished NHS neonatal unit at St Mary's, cradling two tiny premature babies - one weighing just 5lb.

At the forefront of specialist care for premature babies, the Winnicott looks after some of the most critically ill newborns in the UK.

It can look after up to 18 babies at a time in intensive care, high dependency or special care.

Around 350 premature or sick newborn babies are cared for each year by the multidisciplinary team.

The Lindo Wing was re-opened in June 2012 after extensive refurbishment.

Prince William was born at 9.03pm on June 21, 1982, weighing 7lb 1.5oz in the same wing.

He made his public debut with his parents outside the hospital, wrapped in a white blanket and carefully carried by his mother Diana, Princess of Wales.

New father Prince Charles beamed proudly at their side.

Harry was born in the same exclusive wing just over two years later.

Diana, Princess of Wales, returned to St Mary's in April 1997 - four months before her death in a Paris car crash - when she toured the paediatric intensive care unit, meeting poorly youngsters.

Kate and William, who spent the weekend at Kensington Palace, traveled without a police escort, their spokesman said.

He added: 'Things are progressing as normal.'

The news that what had been dubbed by
 bored journalists ‘the Great Kate Wait’ was finally over was announced 
in a brief statement from Kensington Palace at 7.30am after rumours she 
had been spotted began circulating.

The statement read: 'Her Royal 
Highness The Duchess of Cambridge has been admitted this morning to St 
Mary’s Hospital, Paddington, London, in the early stages of labour.

'The Duchess travelled by car from Kensington Palace to the Lindo Wing at St Mary’s Hospital with The Duke of Cambridge.'

There was a strong police presence around the hospital and two police officers guarded the entrance to the private wing.

Carly Gargett, 31, an event manager 
from Sydney, Australia, who lives in London, said: 'I have been doing 
live Facebook updates to all my friends back in Australia.

'They were texting me this morning saying ‘What’s going on?’ because I’d missed it happening so early.

'So I came down to the site on my way to work.

'I am a real royalist.

'I was at the Coronation Festival last week and was hoping she would go into labour then.'

Calling Doctors Farthing and Setchell: The Royal delivery duo

The Queen’s current surgeon-gynaecologist Marcus Setchell, and Alan Farthing, the surgeon-gynaecologist to the royal household, are both playing key roles throughout Kate's pregnancy.

Mr Setchell will take the lead for Kate's delivery, assisted by Mr Farthing.

Consultant Mr Farthing, 47, is the former fiance of murdered television presenter Jill Dando and took up his role in the royal household in 2008. This is the first royal pregnancy since his appointment.

Mr Setchell, 69, treated Kate for her severe morning sickness last December.

Mr Setchell has been a royal surgeon-gynaecologist for 18 years and cared for Sophie, Countess of Wessex, delivering her two babies, Lady Louise Windsor, now nine, and Viscount Severn, four.

The Countess collapsed and was close to death when Lady Louise was born prematurely in 2003, after the placenta ruptured the lining of the womb.

Mr Setchell also led the medical care following her ectopic pregnancy in 2001.

He performed the Duchess of Cornwall’s hysterectomy in 2007 at the King Edward VII Hospital, where the Duchess of Cambridge was treated for her morning sickness.

In recognition of his work, the father-of-four was awarded a personal honour by the Queen in 2004 when he was made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order.

When Mr Farthing took on his role for the royal household in 2008, he became one of the youngest doctors to treat the royal family.

He was reported to have met the Duchess last year after her wedding to Prince William.

Mr Farthing qualified as a doctor in 1986. He became a member of  the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in 1991, and a fellow in 2003.

In 1997, he became a consultant gynaecologist at St Mary’s Hospital and an honorary senior lecturer at Imperial College, London.

He is a specialist in gynaecological cancer care and an internationally recognised expert in keyhole surgery.

Mr Farthing went on to open his own private Harley Street practice and works as a consultant at two teaching hospitals in London, Queen Charlotte’s in Shepherd’s Bush and St Mary’s.

Prince William and his brother Harry were delivered by Mr Setchell’s predecessor, the late Sir George Pinker, who delivered nine royal babies between 1973 and 1990.

Mr Farthing was engaged to Crimewatch presenter Miss Dando when she was murdered in 1999, five months before they were due to marry. The couple met at a dinner party in 1997 and announced their engagement in 1999.

Miss Dando was shot dead on  her doorstep in April that year  and her murder remains unsolved.
