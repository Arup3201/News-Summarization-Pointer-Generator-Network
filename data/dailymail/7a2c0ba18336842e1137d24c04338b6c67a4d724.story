A Chinese meat factory has been shut down following allegations that it supplied out-of-date meat to American fast-food chains across the country.

Shanghai Husi Food Co, a unit of U.S.-based food supplier OSI Group, was temporarily closed after allegedly selling expired chicken and beef to Chinese branches of McDonald's and KFC.

A TV report showed workers apparently picking up meat from the factory floor, as well as mixing meat beyond its expiration date with fresh produce.

Shockingly, employees were even heard saying that if their clients knew what they were doing, the firm would lose its contracts.

McDonald's and Yum Brands Inc - owner of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, with over 6,200 Chinese branches collectively - immediately stopped using the supplier after the Dragon TV report aired.

Meanwhile, the Shanghai office of China's food and drug agency said it was 
investigating the allegations, and told customers to suspend use of the supplier's 
products.

'At present, the company has been sealed and suspect products seized,' the Shanghai Municipal Food and Drug Administration said on its website.

McDonald's
 sealed 4,500 cases of beef, pork, chicken and other products supplied 
by Husi for investigation, the city government said in a statement.

The Communist Party secretary of 
Shanghai, Han Zheng, has reportedly called for 'severe punishment' of any wrongdoing.

It is the latest food safety scare for McDonald's and KFC, which were hurt by a safety scandal in 2012 involving chicken allegedly pumped with unapproved antibiotic drugs and growth hormones.

Today, the chains apologised to customers following the TV report, adding that the factory had served restaurants in the Shanghai area.

'We will not tolerate any violations of government laws and regulations from our suppliers,' said Yum China, which ordered all of its KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants to seal up and stop using all meat materials supplied by the Husi factory.

Meanwhile a spokesman for McDonald's, which was provided with chicken, beef and lettuce by Husi, told Reuters: 'If proven, the practices outlined in the
 reports are completely unacceptable to McDonald's anywhere in the 
world.

The fast-food branches also said they were conducting their
 own investigations.

China is McDonald's third-biggest market as measured in number of restaurants, while Yum's KFC, based in Louisville, Kentucky, is China's biggest 
restaurant chain, with more than 4,000 outlets and plans to open 700 
more this year.

'I think this is going to be really challenging for both these firms,' said Benjamin Cavender, Shanghai-based principal at China Market Research Group.

'I don't know that this is something an apology can fix so easily, because at this point people don't have a whole lot of trust that they have good systems in place.'

Yum shares were down 3.5 percent at $74.72 and McDonald's shares were down 0.9 percent at $98.13 on Monday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.

The Shanghai Municipal Food and Drug Administration shut down Husi on Sunday after the local Chinese TV broadcast aired.

OSI said on its Chinese website that management was 'appalled by the report.'

The company has formed its own investigation team, is fully cooperating with government inspectors and will take all necessary actions based on results of the investigation.

'Management believes this to be an isolated event, but takes full responsibility for the situation,' OSI said.

OSI, which has close to 60 manufacturing facilities worldwide and had revenue of more than $5 billion in 2012, has been supplying McDonald's in China since 1992 and KFC and Pizza Hut parent Yum since 2008, according to its website.

News of the scare spread quickly to diners negotiating Shanghai's lunch-hour rush today.

'For now I won't go to eat at McDonald's or KFC, at least until this whole thing settles down,' said Xu Xinyu, 24, a financial services worker, eating at a noodle shop near a McDonald's outlet in downtown Shanghai.

Yet some Chinese consumers appear to have developed a comparatively thick skin when it comes to food scandals.

'Isn't everywhere like this?' asked student Li Xiaoye, 20, eating a beef burger in a Shanghai McDonald's outlet. 'I'll keep going because wherever I eat, the issues are all the same.'

The incident highlights the difficulty in ensuring quality and safety along the supply chain in China.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc came under the spotlight this year after a supplier's donkey meat product was found to contain fox meat. It also came under fire for selling expired duck meat in 2011.

OSI is one of McDonald's key meat suppliers and has a good reputation, according to an industry insider speaking on condition of anonymity. He added the incident highlighted the issue firms faced enforcing strict processes with local staff.

As well as Yum and McDonald's, OSI listed Starbucks Corp , Japan's Saizeriya Co Ltd, Papa John's International Inc, Burger King Worldwide Inc and Doctor's Associates Inc's Subway brand as clients in China, according to a 2012 press release.

A Starbucks spokesman told Reuters that the company does not now have any direct business dealings with Husi Food.

Burger King, Subway, Papa John's and Saizeriya did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 

A woman who answered the phone at Husi's headquarters said no one was available to comment.

But a company manager, Yang Liqun, told Xinhua News Agency that Husi has a strict 
quality control system and will cooperate in the investigation.
