Tragic: Will May, pictured, an eighth-grader at Rock Quarry Middle School in Tuscaloosa, was shot dead in a hunting accident on Saturday

A 13-year-old Alabama boy was shot dead on Saturday in a tragic hunting accident.

Will May, an eighth-grader at Rock Quarry Middle School in Tuscaloosa, was hunting rabbits with a group of people at a hunting club on the north border of Sumter County.

According to Fox News, Sumter County Sheriff Tyrone Clark said another teen accidentally fired the gun, shooting and killing May in the late afternoon.

However, NBC News reported that the boy shot himself when his gun discharged as he was putting it away, thinking it was unloaded.

'It was just terrible. We got the call... (when) they were on their way to the hospital,' Dr. Ken Dunivant, May's pastor told Fox.

'It's just devastating whenever one of your little ones are hurt.'

Family and friends are grieving the boy they described as 'outgoing, caring and loving.'

'He had such an engaging smile and deposition,' Dunviant said. 'He could be mischievous, he was just so much fun and we were really blessed.'

Will was the son of Tuscaloosa veterinarian C. Guy May and Beverly May. He had a younger sister named Margaret.

The teen was a big fan of the Auburn University Tigers football team and loved the beach and the outdoors, his family said.

'He was the most outgoing, caring, loving person,' Melissa Goldsmith, a close family friend, told Tuscaloosanews.com. 'He was the most ultimate giver, which is why everyone loved him so much.'

On Sunday night more than 400 teens 
attended a worship service for Will and on Monday fellow Rock Quarry 
students wore Auburn football colors in his memory.Â 

At the service they had an open mic and student after student told stories of their best memories with May.

'I think that says a lot about Will and his character,' his uncle, Joe May, told the news website. 'He liked to have a good time, never met a stranger and didn't have any enemies.'

Will was a member of the National Junior Honor Society, and was involved with the youth group at First United Methodist Church of Tuscaloosa.

His uncle said he also liked to play video games and loved to be 'down at the farm with his Papa, riding around on the buggies, being out in the woods.'

'He just had a good, free spirit about him,' Joe May said.

Sumter County Sheriff's Office said no other information about the shooting will be released until an investigation is complete.
