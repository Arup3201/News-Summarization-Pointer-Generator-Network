Honda and Subaru are making the safest cars on the road, according to a new report by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety - which has spent the last year smashing and mangling countless 2014 vehicle models to see which provide the best protection for drivers and passengers.

Out of the IIHS' 22 vehicles that received the Top Safety Pick+ rating - the highest rating the nonprofit can give - five are Hondas and three are Subarus.

The Audi A4, the Toyota Prius V, Kia Forte and Nissan Sentra all fared among the worst for this year's models.Â

Success: The 2014 Honda Accord made top marks in crash tests performed by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety

New criteria: The IIHS focused its ratings heavily on the 'small frontal overlap crash' in which the vehicle strikes an object with only a small portion of its front end. The Audi A4 did not pass this test

IIHS crashes cars into objects at high speeds from a variety of angles, but this year the nonprofit group is heavily focusing its ratings on the small overlap frontal crash.

Russ Raider, a spokesman for the IIHS, said researchers found that particular kind of crash - where the car strikes an object on only half of the front of the car - results in one quarter of all injuries and deaths in vehicles.

'We were looking at how people are still being seriously injured in frontal crashes, despite the fact that vehicles have improved so much in safety performance over the year,' Mr Raider told MailOnline.

The group is also focusing on new technology that can either alert drivers to an impending frontal crash or even automatically stop the car.

The Audi A4 and the Toyota Prius V both failed the partial frontal crash test. The Infiniti Q50 and Honda Accord top safety choices, according to the IIHS

The following cars passed the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's crash tests, but do not include automatic braking or crash detection technology required for the winners of the Top Safety Pick+ category.

These vehicles were rated Top Safety Pick for 2014, a slightly lesser category. Toyota Camry is notable because it was redesigned after failing crash tests in the two previous years.

The IIHS awarded its Top Safety Pick+ rating only to vehicles that had one or both technologies.

The devices can reduce crashes by up to 15percent, according to studies.

Another 17 vehicles, which passed crash tests but did not have the crash-warning technology received the lesser 'Top Safety Pick' rating.

'The automakers are competing on safety and they want to show that they are earning the top ratings in our evaluations,' Mr Raider said.

'And we want to tell consumers which crash avoidance systems are worth the money and encourage the automakers to make the effective ones more available on their vehicles.'

IIHS was even able to influence the largest automaker in the world to change one of its most popular cars.

After the Toyota Camry failed the small overlap frontal crash two years in a row, the Japanese company redesigned the front end to make it crash resistant.

The 2014 Camry scored 'acceptable' - the second-highest rating.
