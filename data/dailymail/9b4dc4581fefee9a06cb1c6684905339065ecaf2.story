Arsene Wenger’s Wednesday night was up there with the worst in his career, made even more galling by the commemorative pop-up model of the Arsenal manager in the club’s programme.

The Frenchman could only watch on as his Gunners side succumb to a humiliating Champions League defeat against Monaco to leave them staring into the Champions League abyss.

If losing so convincingly against the team where he made his name was bad enough, the fact that Wenger’s figure was depicted in 2D form beforehand made it all the more vexing.

The cut out marked Wenger facing the club for which he made his name as a manager 

Clearly Arsenal’s media team could not have foreseen the 90 minutes ahead - and had wanted to mark the occasion.

But the stunning defeat honed focus on Wenger’s pop-up, even if this is nothing new at the Emirates.

Per Mertesacker, Danny Welbeck and Alexis Sanchez have all been the subject of 3D models too; the timing for Wenger’s couldn’t have been much worse.

Goals from Geoffrey Kondogbia, Dimitar Berbatov and Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco look to have dumped Arsenal out of Europe’s premier competition at the last 16 stage again.
