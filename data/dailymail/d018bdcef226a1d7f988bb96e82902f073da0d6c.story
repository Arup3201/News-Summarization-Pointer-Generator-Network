Allegations: 'Jessica', a girl of 14, claims that she was sexually abused by a violent criminal but the authorities did not intervene (posed by model)

A violent criminal accused of having regular sex with a 14-year-old abused her daily because social services claimed to have 'no power' to stop him, it emerged today.

On one occasion the alleged victim, 'Jessica', who fell pregnant twice, ran away and was found half naked under married father-of-two Arshid Hussain's bed but police arrested her and let him go, secret documents have revealed.

Hussain, then 24, had convictions for robbery and affray, and was about to be jailed for violent disorder.

But Rotherham social services allegedly toldÂ  Jessica's mother they couldn't stop the relationship because she 'went willingly'.

The Times revealed today that Hussain has never been prosecuted for suspected child sex offences, but is now being investigated 14 years on.

At the time he was on a social services list of men believed to be grooming up to 40 young girls and more than a dozen believed he was their 'boyfriend'.

Speaking about when she was caught in bed with him by police, Jessica, which is not her real name, told The Times: 'I was in bed upstairs with Ash when the police came into the house. He panicked and pulled on some trousers.

'I grabbed a pair of knickers and tried to hide under the bed. One of the police officers told me to come out. He could see my legs sticking out.';

Officers then found an offensive weapon and she was arrested, but despite noting later she was 'at risk of sexual abuse' Hussain was released.

The case in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, which has become known as Britain's under-age sex capital, is another example of where the authorities have let down a vulnerable children.

Under fire: It has been alleged that Rotherham Borough Council (pictured) said they had 'no power' to intervene despite an admission the man and girl were having sex

It has been alleged that current 
council deputy leader, Labour's Jagangir Akhtar, who is related to 
Hussain, had known of the relationship.

The Times' Chief Investigative Reporter, Andrew Norfolk, said on an occasion when Jessica went missing Mr Akhtar set up a 'deal under which a violent offender (Hussain) agreed to hand a missing child to police after being assured that he would not be detained'.

But Mr Akhtar, who was a taxi driver at the time, told MailOnline today 'it is total lies' that he knew Hussain was grooming the girl. He also denied there was any deal.

Later, Rotherham Council said Mr Akhtar had stepped down from two key roles with the authority - as deputy leader of the council and vice chairman of the Police and Crime Panel.

The spokesman said: 'The council has referred the allegations made in the Times newspaper relating to councillor Akhtar to South Yorkshire Police to consider if any criminal offence has been committed and to undertake any appropriate criminal investigation.'

Jessica described how she met Hussain days after her 14th birthday in 1999, and after he bought her chicken and chips he took her to some woods and told her: 'You're not really 16 are you? You look too young'.

They starting seeing eachother regularly and her parents could not keep them apart. In the end she was taken into 'emergency' care.

But Jessica was barely in school so the relationship continued, and Hussain would even follow her on holiday, on one occasion renting a caravan in Skegness so they could have sex there.

In June 2000 police and social services reports said that Hussain and the girl, now 15, were 'known to be having a sexual relationship' and she was 'at risk of sexual abuse'.

After he was sent to prison for violent disorder and intimidation in a different case, Jessica got an injunction against him.

'It was like somebody put a spell on me. I 
wanted to marry him. He didn't tell me he was already 
married,' Jessica said.

'I didn't think of myself as being groomed, but now I 
realise it was an abusive relationship. It can 
stay with you for the rest of your life.

'Police and social 
services don't want to take any responsibility for what happened back 
then'.

Damaging:The authorities in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, have been accused of turning a blind eye to sex grooming gangs for more than a decade, confidential files have revealed

A Home Office funded review, examining her case, quoted by The Times said: 'Perpetrator was allowed to contact (Jessica) via mobile telephone, 
was allowed to arrange to collect her from foster carer's home by 
ringing in advance and asking to meet him at the end of 
street' with the 'knowledge and consent' of social services.

There was an 'unwillingness to recognise danger of relationship' an 'in the absence of any criminal prosecution of perpetrator as a pimp, all rumours about him were speculation and there was no cause for concern', the paperwork revealed.

Staff 'also took some comfort in knowing where (Jessica) was', it said, and Hussain was even allowed to attend appointments with her GP.

Solicitor Riyaz Shaikh told MailOnline this afternoon that his client Hussain is unwell and unable to comment today.

A spokesman for Rotherham Borough Council said following Operation Yewtree, the authority asked South Yorkshire Police (SYP) to thoroughly review all historical cases that may be linked to child sexual exploitation.

He added: 'That review is ongoing and continues with a number of live and ongoing investigations. The Council wishes to support SYP and not potentially compromise this process. As such we will not be making further comments on the article without further consultation with our police colleagues.'

South Yorkshire Police said it 'deeply regrets' the publication of the Times story 'about an on-going, complex and highly sensitive investigation into matters of historic child sexual exploitation'.

Last year it emerged police in the 
town turned a blind eye to allegations of sexual abuse of white girls by
gangs of largely Pakistani men for more than a decade.

Research,
reports and case files also revealed that council officials were 
desperate to cover up any racial link to the abuse of young girls.

The
research shows that a string of warnings dating back as far as 2000 
were ignored by the authorities. In many cases, police action was taken 
only against the victims.

There is no evidence to link Arshid Hussain to this crime.
