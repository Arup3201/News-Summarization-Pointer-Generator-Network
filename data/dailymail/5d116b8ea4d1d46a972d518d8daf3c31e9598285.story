Die-ins have been staged in New York and Washington D.C. as demonstrations against police brutality and racism entered the fourth day. 

Hundreds gathered in Grand Central and Union Station while Eric Garner's widow, Esaw, issued a rallying cry to the protesters to 'keep fight for what's right'. 

Speaking at the National Action Network's headquarters in Harlem, New York, alongside Al Sharpton and Spike Lee, she said: 'I just want to thank each and every person that's out there marching.

'Just keep fighting. Keep fighting for what's right, to get justice.' 

After lying on the ground for a short time, the protesters in both stations got up to carry on marching around the cities.

Esaw Garner, Eric's widow, has issued a rallying cry to the demonstrators urging them to 'keep fighting for what is right' 

The chokehold victim's mother Gwen Carr was also at the meeting held at the National Action Network's headquarters in Harlem, New York City 

According to the New York Daily News, Mrs Garner experienced the protests up close - one when they walked outside of her window and another time when they blocked her car.

She said: 'My son woke me up out my sleep and said, 'Ma, look out the window there's like a thousand people on the street. 

'I see all these people and they're yelling out, 'Eric Garner,' and everything and I'm just like overwhelmed.' 

Spike Lee announced that there would be a march on Washington D.C. next week against the recent cases of alleged police brutality. As he walked on staged the crowd erupted in applause. 

Protests are expected to continue in New York after the funeral of a black man who was unarmed when he was shot dead by a police officer in a darkened stairwell of a Brooklyn apartment building.

The shooting of Akai Gurley, 28, by a New York city police officer at a city housing project last month is the latest in a series of incidents fueling public outrage over what many see as a pattern of callous misuse of lethal force against minority groups.

Al Sharpton and Spike Lee were also at the news conference days after a Grand Jury decided not to indict the officer involved in Garner's death 

The district attorney in the New York City borough of Brooklyn said on Friday a grand jury would consider charges against Peter Liang, the officer who shot Gurley. Police have said Liang may have accidentally discharged his gun.

Gurley was eulogized on the morning after a cold, drenching rain helped tame protests in New York on Friday.

On Friday night hundreds of people gathered at various locations in New York - and elsewhere across the United States - to denounce the use of deadly force against minorities, which they believe to be motivated attacks under the guise of control.

More than one hundred people stormed into an Apple Store on Central Park South and Fifth Avenue to stage a brief 'die-in,' sprawling on the floor of the crowded showroom as shoppers and employees watched.

Many also blocked the FDR Drive, one of the main arteries around the city.

'The protests remained very peaceful throughout the night,' said Detective Michael DeBonis, a spokesman for the New York Police Department. 

It was a brief departure from the peaceful rallies of the previous two night and the group left without incident after about five minutes.

Day three: Hundreds of protesters brought New York's Apple store on Fifth Avenue to a standstill on Friday

Similar demonstrations were staged at Macy's flagship department store in Herald Square and at Grand Central Terminal, one of the city's two main rail stations. garner

Police stood by but allowed the protesters to briefly occupy both locations.

Some stores in midtown Manhattan shut early in response to the recent unrest. 

Representatives of Best Buy Co Inc and Target Corp said the companies had temporarily closed stores early as a precaution.

Meanwhile, nearly 100 people, including local civic leaders, huddled under umbrellas near the site of Garner's death for a candlelight vigil on Staten Island.

'This is a movement, a rainbow of people,' the Rev. Demetrius Carolina of the First Central Baptist Church told the racially mixed crowd.

In Chicago, protesters paused for a moment of silence, as a siren could be heard wailing nearby.

Renee Alexander, 44, a nurse from Woodbridge, Virginia, who joined about 200 protesters in downtown Washington, expressed outrage over the images of Garner's death, captured in the video widely shown on television and the Internet.

'It's heartbreaking for me to watch, over and over on TV, how his life was cut short on the street, just like a dog,' she said. 'They had no respect for him. No human being should die in the street like that - choked to death.' 

Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson said on Friday he will convene a grand jury to consider charges against the New York City officer who shot Gurley. 

Police there have said the officer, Peter Liang, may have accidentally discharged his gun.

At a news conference with Gurley's relatives on Friday, Kevin Powell, the president of the advocacy group BK Nation, called the shooting part of a 'series of modern-day lynchings.'

Gurley's mother, Sylvia Palmer, tearfully demanded justice for her son. A wake for Gurley was scheduled for Friday night, with his funeral to follow on Saturday.

Elsewhere: Meanwhile, demonstrators marched in front of the national guard in Ferguson, Missouri

Solidarity: Demonstrations were also held in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on Friday in memory of Eric Garner

In Cleveland on Friday, the family of a 12-year-old boy fatally shot by police filed a lawsuit against the city, a day after the federal government found the police department systematically uses excessive force.

New York police have taken a soft approach to crowd control during this week's protests, generally allowing marchers to proceed unhindered as long as they remained peaceful.

Halfway across the country, activists on Friday concluded a 120-mile protest march to the Missouri governor's mansion from Ferguson, where 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot to death in August by a policeman who initially stopped the teenager for walking in the street.

Some witnesses to the confrontation told a grand jury that Brown had raised his hands in the air before he was killed, though others contradicted that testimony.

More than 100 protesters shouted, 'hands up, don't shoot' and other slogans as they rallied in the rotunda of the state capitol in Jefferson City.

Unlike the August 9 slaying of Brown, Garner's encounter was captured on video. Pantaleo could still face disciplinary action from an internal police investigation, his lawyer said. Chokeholds are banned by police department regulations.

Pantaleo told the grand jury he used a proper takedown technique and denied putting pressure on Garner's neck, according to his lawyer, Stuart London. 

The city's medical examiner has said Garner's death was caused by compressing his neck and chest, with his asthma and obesity contributing.

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has said the Justice Department will pursue civil rights investigations into both the Missouri shooting and the New York case, though legal experts have said federal charges for the two officers are unlikely.
