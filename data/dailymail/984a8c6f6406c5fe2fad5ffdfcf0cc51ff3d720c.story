A woman died after she was attacked by her husband who suffered from Alzheimer's disease, an inquest has heard.

Christine Williamson, 62, had repeatedly told authorities that she was being assaulted by her mentally ill husband James.

A coroner ruled today that her death could have been prevented if the officials had shared information about the threats that she faced.

Doctors said that Mr Williamson 'would not have known what he was doing' when he struck his wife a fatal blow, due to his advanced dementia.

Following the deadly incident he was taken into a special care home, but the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to charge him with a crime.

Mrs Williamson, from Telford in Shropshire, died from bruising on the brain on October 31 last year, two weeks after she was hit on the head by her husband.

Her death triggered a domestic homicide review to identify what could have been done to prevent her death, the findings of which have been reported to the Home Office.

The inquest at Wellington Civic Centre found that social workers, police, doctors and mental health nurses all knew about isolated incidents of aggression from Mr Williamson.

However, no one was able to flag up the pattern of assaults which made him a danger to his wife because they did not know all the facts.

Shropshire coroner John Ellery said that if all the professionals involved in the case had communicated with each other, they could have taken evasive action.

He said: 'If early action had been taken, Mrs Williamson would have been protected and her death was preventable.'

After the inquest, Chris Ammonds of West Mercia Police said: 'This is a sad and tragic case where the next of kin have not only lost their mother to her injuries, but also their father to his illness.

'This matter has been subject to a domestic homicide review panel to ensure that any lessons to be learnt by all the agencies involved are identified and acted upon.

'The CPS carefully reviewed a file of evidence and has taken into account the illness that Mr Williamson is suffering and the care and treatment being provided by the NHS mental health service.

'Following this they have made the decision that it is not in the public interest to take court proceedings against Mr Williamson in connection with the death of his wife.'

Telford & Wrekin Council spokesman Russell Griffin said social services would implement all of the recommendations expected to come out of the case.

He said: 'We are aware of this very sad case, which has been the subject of the first domestic homicide review to take place in Telford and Wrekin since the legislation was introduced.

'We will be looking at all the recommendations of the review with a view to implementing them as soon as possible as part of the learning that all the agencies involved will draw from this particular case.'
