Theirs was one of the most enduring political partnerships of all time. But that didn’t stop Margaret Thatcher from giving Ronald Reagan a good handbagging when he crossed her.

Newly released National Archives files show the extent to which their relationship was put under strain following a coup in Grenada.

Mrs Thatcher made clear her distaste for US military intervention in the Commonwealth territory, recognising it as a slight on the Queen’s authority as head of state.

Despite their enduring political partnership, Margaret Thatcher was still prepared to give Ronald Reagan a good handbagging over the US intervention in Commonwealth territory

For his part, Mr Reagan saw himself as defending the island against the rebels, who he saw as an ‘unpleasant band of Left-wing thugs’. 

In a letter dated October 24, 1983, Mrs Thatcher wrote that his decision to take action caused her the ‘gravest concern’ and accused him of putting the lives of citizens at risk instead of protecting them.

She says: ‘This action will be seen as intervention by a Western democratic country in the internal affairs of a small independent nation, however unattractive its regime…

‘I must ask you to think most carefully about these points. I cannot conceal that I am deeply disturbed by your latest communication.

‘You asked for my advice. I have set it out and hope that even at this late stage you will take it into account before events are irrevocable.’

But he told her the US military were already ‘at zero’.

In an account of a phone call on October 26, Reagan tells Mrs Thatcher that if he was in London, he would throw his hat in the door first – presumably to avoid being shot. Mrs Thatcher clearly wasn’t impressed as she barely spoke during their 15-minute conversation.

He told her he ‘very much regretted’ the embarrassment caused and confessed he had been on a golf holiday when  he was woken at 3am and informed of the situation.

The note adds: ‘He wanted the Prime Minister to know that there was absolutely no feeling of a lack of confidence in the British Government but this was the first decision he had taken during his Administration which had been properly kept secret.’
