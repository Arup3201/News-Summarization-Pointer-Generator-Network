An Australian publisher and her two American business partners are locked in a bitter dispute over the royalties to the ‘Fifty Shades of Grey’ trilogy.

Jennifer Pedroza, of Arlington, Texas, is suing Amanda Hayward for tens of millions of dollars in profits and Christa Beebe is seeking thousands in lost wages the pair accused Hayward of taking even after she swore on her daughter’s life she would not con them.

Pedroza was a partner and Beebe an employee at The Writer’s Coffee Shop, which owns the U.S. publishing rights to the erotic thriller penned by E.L. James. They filed their suit last week in Tarrant County District Court.

Hayward, an Australian national, founded the company in Australia but ran it out of Texas, even appearing on Dallas television shows to promote the trilogy at one point, according to lawyer Mike Farris, who is representing the plaintiffs in their suit.

Pedroza claims her 25 per cent stake in the joint venture entitles her to at least $20million, by Farris’ estimates of the amount of royalties paid to James, of which TWCS is entitled to half.

‘By November of 2013, three royalty payments should have been made by Random House… for at least $95 million,’ the suit claims.

Hayward is instead accused of having publisher Random House, which distributed the book in the U.S., send the windfall to an account of hers in Australia, and claiming financial problems in the States while buying herself a mansion in a tony Sydney suburb.

‘Because of her chicanery, all payments flowed to her,’ the suit contends.

The accused: The lawsuit claims Amanda Hayward wrongfully dissolved the partnership and fired both women

The accused swindler is said in the lawsuit, a copy of which has been reviewed by MailOnline, to have talked the two women into signing services agreement contracts that included ‘termination without cause’ clauses.

This, the lawsuit asserts, was an underhanded and illegal attempt to convert the partnership into a sole proprietorship owned only by Hayward.

The collective was initially founded by Hayward, Pedroza and two others after the women met online through literature fan pages as a way for mothers to have their novels published, according to Ferris.

It was launched a virtual publishing company in October 2010, making all of its novels available as e-books.

The women are said to have stumbled upon E.L. James’ trilogy through those message boards as well, because they had published previous works of hers.

No one expected ’50 Shades’ to achieve such success.

When Beebe, a school teacher by trade, brought up her concern about the clause with Hayward and said told her she had to either stay with TWCS of accept a teaching position – Hayward guaranteed her a job for the entire 2013-2014 school year.

That guarantee came in a March 21, 2013 email from Hayward to Beebe.

‘I guarantee your job until next September,’ wrote Hayward. ‘Love ya.’

Both Beebe and Pedroza were canned November 1, 2013.

Their terminations were announced in an email that called their firings a ‘very sad decision.’

The reason given was a lack of money.

But just one year earlier, Hayward had bought a $5million mansion, and tens of millions of dollars were being paid to TWCS by Random House. The lavish home has a gym, tennis court, pool and various other luxuries, according to a previous sale listing posted online.

Pedroza was never given her 25 per cent share of those profits, and Beebe lost her guaranteed $5,000 a month from working the job she was previously guaranteed.

An interview given to a Fort Worth newspaper about the ordeal ended up with Hayward serving them a cease and desist order.

Both women declined to speak to MailOnline through Ferris, citing the order.

Hayward declined to speak through a TWCS spokesperson.

The plaintiffs are seeking equitable relief and damamges from funds already paid, as well as to have Random House deposit further royalties into a kind of escrow account held by the court to ensure they are distributed fairly.

Both James and Random House are not expected to have involvement in the case.

The first book in the erotic trilogy is currently being made into a movie.
