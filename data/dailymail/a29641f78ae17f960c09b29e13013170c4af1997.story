An Ohio couple who married on Christmas Day decided to share their vows in the hospital room where their four-year-old son, Billy, is being treated for cancer.

Sarah Lewis and William Cramer say over the years they made other wedding plans that fell through.

The Akron Beacon Journal reports the timing then worked out for Thursday's special wedding at Akron Children's Hospital, with relatives in town for Christmas and Cramer's uncle available as a minister.

'This has been our second home the past year,' Sarah told the newspaper.

The hospital wedding made the occasion more about their family and the people who have been caring for Billy, she said.

Plus, Sarah said after the ceremony: 'It shows we’re going to be together for the long haul.”

Lewis and Cramer live in Mogadore, in suburban Akron.

Hospital workers prepared quickly for the wedding, which took just over a week.

Relatives including the couple's other children, two-year-old Mason and one-year-old Delaney, jingled bells from the back of the room.

Doctors say Billy appears to be beating his neuroblastoma cancer, a cancer of neural tissue that most commonly forms in childhood, rarely in adults. 

Billy’s cancer started in the adrenal gland on top of his left kidney. 

The cancer, which is difficult to treat, then spread into his bones.
