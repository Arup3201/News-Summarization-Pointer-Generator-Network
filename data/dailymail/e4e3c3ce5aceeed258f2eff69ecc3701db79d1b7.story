Former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell and his wife have been indicted on federal corruption charges for illegally accepting luxury clothes, free vacations, large loans and private plane rifes from a wealthy Richmond businessman who allegedly expected political favors in return.

Authorities alleged that McDonnell and his wife received gifts from Jonnie R. Williams a former chief executive of Star Scientific Inc, a dietary supplement maker. McDonnell has not been charged with any crime.

The indictment alleges that the McDonnells worked together to bestow the prestige of the governors office to Williams' firm - which was a former cigarette manufacturer.

The 14-count indictment against McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, includes one count of conspiracy to commit honest-services wire fraud; three counts of honest-services wire fraud; one count of conspiracy to obtain property under color of official right; six counts of obtaining property under color of official right; and one count of making false statements to a federal credit union.

Bob McDonnell is also charged with an additional count of making a false statement to a financial institution, and Maureen McDonnell is charged with one count of obstruction of an official proceeding.

'Today's charges represent the Justice 
Department's continued commitment to rooting out public corruption at 
all levels of government,'

McDonnell left office earlier this month after four years in the governor's office. Virginia law limits governors to a single term.

A federal investigation overshadowed the final months in office for the once-rising star of the Republican Party, with authorities looking into gifts he and his family received from a political donor.

In July, McDonnell apologized and 
said he had returned more than $120,000 in loans and other gifts from 
Johnnie Williams, the CEO of pharmaceutical company Star Scientific.

He
 insisted that he had done nothing illegal on behalf of Star Scientific 
but said he'd do 'things differently today than choices I made a couple 
of years ago.'

On Tuesday, McDonnell repeated that apology but insisted he had done nothing wrong.

'I
 deeply regret accepting legal gifts and loans from Mr. Williams, all of
 which have been repaid with interest, and I have apologized for my poor
 judgment for which I take full responsibility,' McDonnell said.

'However,

exchange for what I believed was his personal generosity and friendship.

The scandal unfolded around the same time as a separate politically embarrassing case involving a former executive mansion chef who was accused of embezzlement and, in turn, accused McDonnell's children of taking mansion food and supplies for personal use.

The governor later reimbursed the state.

The fallout seeped into the general election, with McDonnell playing a low-key role in support of Republican Ken Cuccinelli, who lost to Democrat Terry McAuliffe.

Asked why he hadn't been more visible, McDonnell replied, 'That's a question for the candidate.'

McDonnell, 59, is the first governor ever to face criminal charges in Virginia.

Gov McDonnell was accused of used the influence of his office to promote Star Scientific's anti-inflammatory supplement, Anatabloc, for Jonnie R. Williams Sr and his company.

They contributed more than $100,000 to McDonnell's political organizations and gave the governor's family personal gifts worth thousands of dollars.

Some of the 'luxury items' were said to include cosmetic dentistry work for the mother-of-five, as well as jewelry and a $15,000 Bergdorf Goodman shopping spree for Maureen.

The governor made a public apology in July and repaid $50,000 in loans as well as another $70,000 loan made to a small business McDonnell set up with his sister.

He then returned what he called 'tangible' gifts his family accepted from Williams.

According to a person close to the McDonnells and familiar with the PAC's operations, Maureen had complained to the committee she did not have enough funds to keep up the style she believed a first lady should uphold.

The family were allegedly struggling after their finances were hit by the real estate market and properties they bought totaling $3.84million lost value.

Maureen McDonnell was given a PAC credit card after she made the complaint, according to the source.

Indeed, in August, McDonnell announced on his hourm long monthly show on Washington's WTOP radio that he is working with his private legal team to return all gifts still in his family's possession to Williams.

Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, however, said he won't return Williams' gifts or reimburse him for their reported $18,000 value because they include vacations, dinners and private jet travel - not things that can be given back.

There are some bells you can't un-ring. You can't un-take an airplane flight,' Cuccinelli said. '...I didn't get loans, didn't get cash, didn't get shopping sprees.'

Maureen McDonnell spent $6,000 around the time of Bob McDonnell's January 2010 inauguration and complained to the PAC the family did not have enough to finance her first lady wardrobe

Asked why he wouldn't reimburse Williams for the gifts' value, he said because, 'No money changed hands.'

Cuccinelli, the Republican nominee to succeed McDonnell as governor, disclosed his gifts from Williams on his required statements of economic interest, although he accepted some of them years before they were reported.

Cuccinelli amended four years' worth of financial disclosure reports in April, listing a $3,000 family vacation and a $1,500 catered Thanksgiving dinner at Williams' luxury waterfront villa on Virginia's Smith Mountain Lake among items he had earlier overlooked.

McDonnell's gifts from Williams, however, came to light through weeks of news reports, not his own economic interest filings.

His gifts were more numerous and more tangible, including a $6,500 Rolex watch inscribed to the '71st governor of Virginia,' the check for 28-year-old daughter Cailin, and a $10,000 engagement check for daughter Jeanine, 32, before her May wedding. Both wedding gifts have already been returned, McDonnell said.

Spokesman for the governor and first lady Rich Galen told the Washington Post in July that Maureen McDonnell was borrowing the expensive clothes and they would be donated to charity once her husband's term is complete

'I am working with my counsel to return gifts that have been given,' McDonnell said. 'My eldest daughter returned her engagement gift and my daughter Cailin has returned her wedding gift, and there are other substantial items that are in the process of being returned, and I'll let you know more when I do.'

In July, McDonnell said he had repaid nearly $125,000 in personal and business loans that Williams made, and the governor, through his private legal and public relations team, issued an apology to Virginians.

The governor did not disclose either the loan from Williams or gifts from him which candidates and public officeholders are required to file annually broadly sketching out their personal finances.

McDonnell, entering the final five months of the single, non-renewable term to which Virginia uniquely limits its governors, defended his decision not to report the gifts, noting that the state's ethics laws compel disclosure only of gifts given directly to officeholders or candidates themselves, not to their immediate families.

The McDonnells, both 59 years old, believe they have done nothing illegal and plan to fight the charges in court, they said in separate statements through their lawyers.

McDonnell, a Republican, said in July he had repaid $120,000 in loans from Jonnie Williams, a major campaign donor and the founder of Star Scientific. He also apologized for the embarrassment the gifts and loans to him and his family had caused Virginia.

Williams resigned as Star Scientific chief executive in December.

McDonnell had acknowledged that he and his family received more than $160,000 in gifts and loans from Williams.

The gifts from Williams ranged from a $6,500 Rolex watch for McDonnell, to wedding and engagement presents and money for his daughters, and a $15,000 shopping spree for first lady Maureen McDonnell.

A spokeswoman for Star Scientific did not immediately return a call requesting comment.
