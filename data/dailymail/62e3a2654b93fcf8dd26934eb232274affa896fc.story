Chelsea and England defender John Terry has received £21.25million after selling his two neighbouring houses, including one which was to be his dream home.

The footballer, together with his wife and twin children, had planned to live in the nine-bedroom white mansion, which was built next door to his old property.

Terry, 33, sold his original red-brick house last year for £5.25million after three years on the market, but then received an out of the blue £16million offer for his new home.

He had bought the luxury pad for £1.8million in 2007 and spent a further £4million renovating it, even building a man-made fishing lake in the back garden.

Terry, whose £170,000-a-week Chelsea contract runs out this summer, bagged a £10million profit on the sale to a mystery foreign investor.

The cost of the home is twice the price of the average Surrey property, and the sale of the house has prompted further speculation that the footballer is planning to leave Chelsea in favour of a move abroad.

His family are now believed to be renting another property.

His spokesman told The Sun that the house had not been put on the market, but that Terry and his wife Toni had 'received a fabulous offer which they decided to accept'.

It had taken father-of-two Terry three years to sell his first house, which he had bought for £2.25million in 2003 and reportedly had to re-mortgage four times.

In 2010 the former England captain was advised to drop the asking price by three quarters of a million pounds.

However, helped by the burgeoning property market, he was finally able to sell it for more than the £5million asking price, helping him finance the second mansion - located just a short drive from Chelsea's training ground in Cobham.

Constructed at the end of a private road, the huge new home is hidden away from prying eyes and is only clearly visible from the air.

It comprises eight dressing and bathrooms, nine bedrooms, a swimming pool and sauna.

The mansion even has its own private cinema and sauna.

Terry, a keen angler, was given permission to build the fishing lake in April 2012 - despite it being on green belt land.

It all adds up: Chelsea's John Terry was spotted doing some pre-Christmas shopping at Poundworld in nearby Woking by Jack Jeffery last month

Terry was reported to have incurred a mortgage debt of £4.6million pounds on the building of the new house.

Construction work started in December 2011 and the finished mansion is believed to include a 33x40ft indoor swimming pool, complete with a jacuzzi, steam room and changing facilities.

Staff are also reportedly accommodated in one wing and there is also a visitor annexe in the opposite wing.

Not only did Roman Abramovich and Jose Mourinho transform the 
fortunes of Chelsea, they also turned the area around the Premier League
 club's training ground into the most exclusive in Britain.

The 
gated mansions close to the west London club's Cobham base had been known 
as the ‘gin and Jag’ belt of Surrey but was transformed to the 'Beverley
 Hills of Britain' eight years ago.

Traditionally it had been an area that attracted the UK's richest bankers, business people and celebrities, but footballers flocked from Chelsea, Kensington and other parts of London to leafy Surrey villages.

John Terry and his Chelsea team mates began decamping to the area in 2005 after 
Chelsea's training ground moved to Stoke d'Abernon, near Cobham, after the
 then manager Jose Mourinho, now in his second spell, decreed they should all live within minutes of 
it.

The Special One himself also bought a grand home in the area, where a mansion costs an average of £4.5million, around £200,000 more than a year ago.

His captain led the way and then team mates like Ashley
 Cole, Frank Lampard, Didier Drogba, and Fernando Torres bought mansions for themselves and their 
WAGS.

Terry fell out with Oxshott near-neighbour and once 
close friend Wayne Bridge, after an alleged affair
 with French underwear model Vanessa Perroncel, Bridge's then 
girlfriend. Terry was sacked as England captain.

Oxshott is reputedly the most expensive village in Britain. Like 
Cobham it is in the district council area of Elmbridge, which also 
includes ­Claygate, Esher and Weybridge, each a couple of miles apart.

The
 leafy idyll is home to Elton John, Gary Lineker, Jenson Button and Andy
 Murray, and residents pay more income tax than any other area of the 
UK.

The tax man receives £1.18billon a 
year from residents of Elmbridge, twice the amount drawn from Cardiff 
and Newcastle combined, and 200 times more than from Google.

The
 footballers' needs, and those of their wives and girlfriends, are well 
catered for in the area - even the corner shops stock Dom Perignon and 
Krug champagne while traditional shops have been replaced with hair salons.

The neo-classical houses on the Crown Estate in Oxshott are a favourite with the players.

Each
 property is built on half-acre or so, separated from the others by 
red-brick walls and swathes of evergreen foliage.

Demands: Chelsea's Jose Mourinho told players they had to live within minutes of the club's Cobham training ground, and stars like John Terry led the way
