A British couple who were kidnapped in India have been rescued by police in a joint operation by Indian and English officers, it has tonight been confirmed.

The Metropolitan Police launched a joint investigation with counterparts in Chennai after receiving a report the couple, reportedly of Sri Lankan origin, had been kidnapped.

Tonight, Scotland Yard said: 'The Metropolitan Police Service have been working with Indian authorities to secure the release of two British nationals kidnapped in Chennai since 29th May.

'The investigation was led by the Chennai police with the MPS offering support to the family in London.

'The couple have now been rescued and are safe and well.

'This remains an ongoing investigation in both countries and therefore no further details are available at this time.'

The Bangalore-based Deccan Herald reported that the couple’s daughter, who also lives in London, sparked the police investigation after receiving a telephone ransom demand for £300,000.

The victims had reportedly flown to Colombo, Sri Lanka, for a wedding, before flying to India for a nine-day temple tour.

The couple were lured into what they thought was a taxi, it was reported, which they believed had been sent by their hotel to collect them.

A Chennai police commissioner said a gang operated from London and India to orchestrate the abduction.

Several suspects are believed to have been arrested.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of the abduction of two British nationals.

'They are now safe and well. We are offering consular assistance to the victims and their families.'This incident remains a matter for the local police.'
