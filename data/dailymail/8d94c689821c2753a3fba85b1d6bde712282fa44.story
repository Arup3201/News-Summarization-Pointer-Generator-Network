A woman told she would never be able to give birth now has more than 150 children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren.

Emma Derrick, 88, of Knowle, Bristol, was plagued by rheumatic fever as a child which left her with a tiny 4ft 8in frame, and doctors said it was unlikely she would ever be able to carry a baby.

However, she went on to have 14 children with husband Dennis - and her offspring have since flourished, met their own partners and gone on to have more children.

Mrs Derrick said: ‘The doctor told me if I managed to have one baby then I could have a dozen. I kept him to his word. It can be tough keeping track of everyone but I do love them all.

‘I wouldn’t change any of them. Having family around you is the most important thing in life.’

Emma Derrick’s youngest daughter, Sandy, said her mother has 14 children, and at least 46 grandchildren, 90 great-grandchildren and three great great-grandchildren. The current total is 153.

Mrs Derrick, whose fourth great-great-grandchild is due soon, suffered three bouts of rheumatic fever during her teenage years and her parents were told it was likely she would ever have children.

The inflammatory disease, which occurs as a result of becoming infected by group A streptococci bacteria, can lead to heart failure and inflammation of joints.

She struggled to recover from rheumatic fever throughout her childhood and was told having children would be too dangerous.

But Mrs Derrick defied the odds and is now surrounded by scores of photographs of her enormous brood at home - and has dozens of relatives on her doorstep.

Her children and grandchildren range in age from Royston, who is 67, to the latest addition, who is almost one.

She said: ‘When I was 16 they all told me I couldn’t have children, I had rheumatic fever three times. When I did have a baby they were perfect.

‘We got married at 16 and I didn’t have children until I was 21. We weren’t actively trying to defy doctors, it just happened. They are all miracles. I prayed for a baby and it was answered.

‘I couldn’t win though - I had three boys before I had a girl, then I had three girls and they asked for a brother.’

Mrs Derrick has outlived two of her children and a baby, named Emma, was stillborn.

She added: ‘Of course, there have been some good times and some bad times, but I have always thought the best way to get through life is to concentrate on the good times.

‘My mother always used to say if you can’t look after them then you shouldn’t have them in the first place, and I always kept to that.

‘I got a lot of help along the way from friends and family but I did a lot of it myself, I was always cooking and cleaning.’

The family lived in two houses in Knowle and Mr Derrick ran a garage in nearby Ashton Vale.

Now, the family occasionally get together for celebrations but there are so many relatives that parties are usually held at a community hall.

Mr Derrick died 20 years ago and his widow now lives on her own, but she often has someone coming over to run errands or help out around the house.
