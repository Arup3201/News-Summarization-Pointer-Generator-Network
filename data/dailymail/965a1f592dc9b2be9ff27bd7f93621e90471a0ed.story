Combing through the bushland in Northern Territory, Jayden Provost set off on a hunting adventure to a remote cattle station, west of Katherine when he heard a noise coming from a scrub nearby.

The 20-year-old took the safety off the weapon and started running towards the noise while holding the crossbow towards the ground.

It wasn’t long before Provost, who now lives in Central Coast on the north coast of Sydney, stopped to look down to see what was holding his foot back.

Jayden Provost was taken to hospital after shooting himself in the foot with his crossbow while hunting

‘I had shot myself with the crossbow – pinning my foot to the ground,’ Provost told Daily Mail Australia.

Trying to remain calm, the keen hunter pulled his foot up to look underneath his thong and noticed the end of the bolt had pierced right through and out the bottom.

‘I started to hop on one leg for about one kilometre back to the homestead before making my way to my room to put my crossbow back in its box,’ he recalls.

‘I was worried about telling my manager at the time and I didn’t want to go to his home because he didn’t know I had purchased one [crossbow].

‘So I thought I would try and pull it out myself but when I tried, it didn’t budge at all.’

The end of the bolt had pierced right through his foot and back out the bottom of the thong

The incident happened in 2013 but he has made a full recovery after he was told he couldn't walk for months

It was the winter of June 2013, when his hunting experience had gone horribly wrong one evening.

‘There was not a drop of blood and believe it or not, it didn’t really hurt too badly – it was just throbbing a lot and felt really tight.

‘It started to hurt a bit when I walked to the kitchen and then I collapsed on the ground so I yelled out for help. Shortly after, the chef heard me so he came onto the veranda and looked shocked.

‘He yelled at me, saying: “Is that a crossbow bolt through your foot you silly p***k?”.

Provost, who now works at a seafood export company, was taken to the nearest hospital by his colleague, which was an hour and a half away.

‘I was lying in the back seat and I started to feel a lot of pressure building up and honestly, I just wanted it out already.

‘It took us an hour and a half to get into town so my colleague chucked me a packet of smokes and said to get them into me.

‘It helped take my mind off the pain and I ended up smoking about 20 on the way.’

Provost, who works at a seafood export company, said the incident hasn't deterred him from hunting

The 20-year-old hopped on one leg for one kilometre back to his room to hide the weapon in a box

When Provost arrived at Katherine Hospital, 320 kilometres south-east of Darwin, he got out of the vehicle and hopped on one foot to the emergency room.

‘I went up to the reception desk and told the lady I had a sore foot so she asked to take a look,’ he told Daily Mail Australia.

‘I took a few steps back and held my foot up in the air and the look she gave me – it was like she had seen a ghost.

‘She started to panic and immediately took me to a bed.

‘I had doctors, nurses and paramedics coming in and asking for pictures – so I put on a smile and took some pictures with them.’

When the doctor arrived, he told Provost: ‘I’ve never seen anything like this before in my years as a doctor’.

 Provost went on an adventure to a remote cattle station to test out his new weapon on his day off from work

The 20-year-old accidentally shot himself with a crossbow when he was running to do some hunting

After putting a ‘numbing block’ on his leg to ease the pain, the doctor gave him two options – to be asleep during the procedure or awake while the arrow gets removed.

‘I told them to just do it while I’m awake,’ he said.

‘They got a scalpel and put a cut on either side to release some pressure and then he started to pull and yank on the arrow.

‘The pain started to get too much and I got really aggressive so I told the doctor to put me to sleep.’

When Provost woke up after the surgery, he said he felt ‘good and ready to go back to work’.

‘The doctor told me I was lucky that I didn’t break any of my bones but at the time, I couldn’t feel two of my toes so they sent me to the Royal Darwin Hospital for another surgery to try and repair my digital nerve but it was unsuccessful.

‘I got told it would take a few months before I could walk on it again but two weeks later, I was up and going again and made a full recovery.

Provost tried to pull the arrow out but couldn't get it to budge so he hopped one kilometre to safety

When Provost woke up after the surgery, he said he actually felt ‘good and ready to go back to work’

Despite the dangerous accident, Provost said the incident hasn’t deterred him from hunting in the future

Despite the dangerous accident, Provost said the incident hasn’t deterred him from hunting in the future.

‘My accident didn’t turn me off mustering at the cattle station and it is one of my favourite jobs. But I’m living in NSW with my family and have a partner here.

When asked what advice he would give to someone who might experience what he encountered, Provost said ‘don’t try and pull the arrow out if you accidently shoot yourself’.

‘I personally don’t think crossbows are dangerous because it was my own fault for not having the safety on,' he said.

‘It’s not like the movies so just go to the hospital and they will yank it out for you.

‘I would have been out hunting the next day if I could have.’
