The extreme winter weather around the Great Lakes will cause Lake Superior to completely freeze over, an expert predicts.

An estimated 91 per cent of its surface was covered in ice on February 6, the most recent measurement, according to the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory.

But Jay Austin, associate professor at the Large Lakes Observatory in Duluth, Minnesota, believes that the lake, which has a surface area of 31,700 square miles and is the largest freshwater lake in the world, will freeze over before the arrival of spring.

Lake Superior has never had more than 91 per cent ice cover since records began

Monitoring: The ice cover for the Great Lakes stood at 80 per cent as of February 2014

The last total freeze-over was in 1997. However there is now more ice on the lake than then, as it is thicker in the areas that have frozen already.

Its current ice cover equals the record set in 1994, but that is about to be smashed, according to Professor Austin.

The 40-year average annual Lake Superior ice coverage for February is just 30 per cent.

Prof Austin told CNS News that there’s a ‘very high likelihood’ that the lake will freeze in the imminent future, thanks to the longevity of this year’s extreme temperatures.

According to an analysis by NOAA's Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, ice covered 78.7 percent of the Great Lakes on February 6. Not since early 1996 has ice been so widespread on the Great Lakes. Seen here is Lake Superior at 4.22 pm local time on February 7, 2014

He pointed out that the mercury didn’t rise above zero in Duluth, which sits on the edge of Lake Superior, for 23 days in a row recently, breaking the 1936 record of 22 days.

George Leshkevich, who has been tracking Great Lakes ice for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory since 1973, said this winter has had among the most rapid ice buildups of his tenure.

Air temperatures show this is the coldest winter since 1979, according to Twin Cities.

The widespread ice in January and early February this year 'wouldn't have been anomalous back in the '70s or with some of the winters in the mid-'90s'.

'But it certainly has been a while since we've seen this much ice this early,' Leshkevich said.

The extent of the freeze comes despite warnings from scientists that climate change was causing the lake to become warmer.

A study in 2007 suggested that the long-term trend was for higher air temperatures in summer over the lake, and less ice in winter on it.
