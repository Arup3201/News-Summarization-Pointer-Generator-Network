Accused: Bobbie Kugler, 31, is believed to have told police that she set the bunch of pictures alight before throwing them onto a pile of clothes

A mother has confessed to accidentally starting the house fire that killed four of her children while burning photographs of her ex boyfriend.

Bobbie Kugler, 31, is believed to have told police that she set the bunch of pictures alight before throwing them onto a pile of clothes.

As the blaze tore through the two-storey, wood-framed home, in Rochester, New York, her children Gage Reavey, 14, Greg Kugler,13, Kandee Kugler, 12, and six-year-old Kaiden Kugler slept innocently in their beds.

Fire-fighters were on the scene quickly 
and tried to reach the children inside, but the inferno spread through the building with such speed they were unable to get 
to those trapped on the upper floor.

Kugler managed to flee with her two-year-old son Tyron Jackson.

'This fire is a result of human intervention. This was not an accidental fire,' said Fire Chief John Caufield on Saturday.

She was arrested on Friday and charged with
fourth-degree arson and four counts of second-degree manslaughter. At 
her first court appearance on Saturday, she pleaded not guilty to the 
charges. She will reappear in court tomorrow.

Fire-fighters were called to the neighbourhood at 1am on February 18 to extinguish a rubbish fire on the sidewalk.

After
dousing those flames, in what looked like a pile of burning clothes, 
fire-fighters did a routine canvass of the wood-frame apartment building
on the property, Mr Caufield said at the time, and discovered another fire 'that 
appeared to have occurred while we were here.'

The fire crew radioed for help and rushed inside the dwelling, but things sped out of control.

The whole first floor was heavily 
involved with fire,' Mr Caufield said. 'The initial crew that was here 
made entry into the building and rescued a woman and an infant from the 
first-floor apartment.

Tragic: Bobbie Kugler was arrested on Friday and charged with fourth-degree arson and four counts of second-degree manslaughter.

'And
in the short time it took to make that rescue, the fire flashed over 
and took over the whole first floor and extended quickly to the second 
floor.'

Fire officials could see people 
moving on the second floor of the building, but within minutes flames 
were shooting from the windows.

Rochester Mayor Thomas Richards praised the bravery of the fire-fighters.

'The
men and women of the Rochester Fire Department saved the life of a 
mother and her young toddler who were downstairs, then tried repeatedly 
to save the other four children upstairs,' Richards said in a statement 
sent to the Democrat and Chronicle.

'They
risked their lives in the attempt and had to be ordered back when the 
fire flashed and engulfed the house,' MayorÂ  Richards said.

Rochester is about 330 miles northwest of New York City.
