Proving that age is just a number, 91-year-old Harriette Thompson has run straight into the record books.

Not only has the grandmother become the oldest woman to complete 
the Rock 'n' Roll San Diego Marathon, she also broke the US record for the fastest run in the over 90 age group.

Enduring soaring temperatures and still-healing legs from nine radiation treatments, the skin cancer survivor completed Sunday's race in seven hours, seven minutes and 42 seconds.

'I feel wonderful,' Thompson told Competitor after crossing the finish line.

'I feel relieved. But I’m interested in getting into a cold shower and falling into bed for a while.'

Supergran: Harriette Thompson, 91, completed the 2014 Rock 'n' Roll San Diego Marathon with a time of 7 hours, 7 minutes and 42 seconds

The Rock ‘n’ Roll San Diego is the first
 marathon the North Carolina resident ever ran, making her debut at the age of 76, according to 
the Charlotte Observer.

The humble grandmother-of-ten has run it 15 times, and may try again next year.

'If I’m still here next year, I think I’ll probably be able to train better and be in better shape,' Thompson said. 'If I’m able, I’ll try again.'

However, the mother-of-five isn't interested in the accolades. 

Through her runs, she helps to 
raise money for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society’s Team in Training. She's raised more than $90,000 for the society.

The cause is close to her heart because several members of her family had died from some form of cancer, she told NBC 7.

Thompson is also a cancer 
survivor, most recently battling squamous cell carcinoma on her legs.

'I’m 
having radiation on my legs. I just had nine radiation treatments, and 
they’re being healed now,' she said before Sunday’s race.

She told Charlotte Observer she regretted having the treatments before the race, which left her legs infected, swollen and tender.

She admitted there was a point in the race when she didn't think she could finish.

'It wasn’t until around the 17th mile that I was going uphill and I was thinking, ‘Oh, I wonder if I’m gonna make this',' Thompson said. 'But the last few miles I didn’t mind at all.'

What's her advice for others hoping to attempt a marathon?

'I guess I could say it's never too late, and you feel wonderful if you - I'm sure that if you exercise, you certainly know the benefits of it,' she said.

She also stay fit by taking yoga and stretching classes, going on long walks and using the elliptical machine.
