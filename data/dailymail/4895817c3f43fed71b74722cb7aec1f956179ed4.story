Plastic made from dead beetles could replace conventional environmentally damaging plastics, according to one scientist.

Aagje Hoekstra uses dead darkling beetles to create biodegradable ‘insect plastic’ by melting together their shells and claims that with some research it could be one solution to reducing the amount of plastic waste dumped in landfill sites.

The Dutch scientist currently uses her innovative material to craft unusual jewellery and lamps.

To make one small sheet of the plastic, called coleoptera, after the Greek word for beetle, Ms Hoekstra currently handpicks the shells from 2,500 dead beetles.

The shells can then be moulded together to produce a piece of coleopteran 10 centimetres squared as they contain a natural plastic called chitin.

Ms Hoekstra uses a chemical process to transform the chitin into chitosan, which bonds better due to a variation in the molecular composition.

‘I press these shields together with a heat press and I get the insect plastic.

‘It took me six months to develop the insect plastic what I have right now,’ she said.

Despite the painstaking process, she hopes the material could one day be an alternative for normal plastic.

A staggering 270,000 tonnes of the manmade non-biodegradable material is thrown away every year in the UK alone, which is around 15 million bottles per day.

The beetle plastic is not only less wasteful as it is biodegradable, but the animals themselves are the byproduct of mealworms, which are farmed for pet food and bait and would otherwise be thrown away.

Ms Hoekstra said she was inspired by the rapid advance insects make in human consumption.

‘For that reason I started cultivate mealworms to see what other positive values insects have.

‘Mealworms are bred for the food industry, primarily for the use of animal feed, and are the larval form of the darkling beetle.

‘The beetles die three or four months after laying their eggs and are then seen as waste.

I decided to research these dead beetles and found out that the beetle's shield contains a polymer called chitin, a type of natural plastic.

The Dutch scientist uses the material, which took her six months to develop, to make laps and jewellery (pictured) but says she is still in the research phases

‘I peel the dead beetles to get the shells off them.’

Ms Hoekstra said that while the insect plastic shows the recipe she uses works, she is still in the research phase.

‘I use this bioplastic for light objects and jewellery, but in future I want to use it for the non-biodegradable plastics,’ she said.

‘My next step is to research the properties of the material, so I know where I can use the material for.

‘The benefits of this material is that it's biodegradable and made of waste material.

‘My hope is that it could become a replacement for normal plastic.’
