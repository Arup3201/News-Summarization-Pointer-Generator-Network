Barcelona's 3-0 win over Elche came years in the making - six members of Luis Enrique's starting lineup were academy-produced while the entire bench also came from their famous footballing finishing school - La Masia.

Here, Sportsmail looks at the 13 who proved as lucky as the Nou Camp black cat for Barcelona

Academy award winners: Munir El Haddadi and Lionel Messi got the goals - and both were academy players

Lionel Messi

Position: Forward

Age: 27

The only thing that perhaps provided any surprise from Messi's two goals against Elche was that he was so sharp just six weeks after a draining World Cup.

The four-time Ballon d'Or winner was back to his best to help Barcelona to an eventually easy win - dropping deep and creating chances for his team-mates as well as the two well-taken strikes.

His second took him within six goals of the all-time Spanish record goalscorer Telmo Zarra and it is now just a matter of days before he can add another line to his bulging CV.

Barcelona famously paid a young Messi's medical bills as he joined their academy and sporting director Carles Rexach was so desperate to sign him he drew up a contract on a napkin. 

Finish: Messi slots home his second game against Elche to put Barca 3-0 up despite having 10 men

Best there is: The four-time Ballon d'Or winner will want to make up for missing out on the World Cup

Munir El Haddadi

Position: Forward

Age: 18

Barcelona's new shining star - Munir left the Nou Camp pitch to a standing ovation after a solid debut capped by a stunning finish to secure the game just after the half-time break.

He has been fast-tracked for a spot in the first team after impressing in pre season despite making just 11 appearances for Barcelona's B side last year.

Barca snapped up the Madrid-born hotshot at the age of 11, nabbing him from the grasp of Atletico Madrid - and what a swoop that could turn out to be.

Blessed with pace, skill and an excellent touch Munir's will be a name to remember.

Dream debut: Munir El Haddadi scored the second goal just after the break to seal the win

Super finish: Munir guided the ball past the 'keeper with a brilliant touch from Ivan Rakitic's through ball

Rafinha

Position: Attacking midfielder

Age: 21

Not quite as impressive as the other two - Rafinha completed a home-grown front three for Barca on Sunday night.

He is the younger brother of Bayern Munich (and former Barcelona) midfielder Thiago and made his debut for the senior side at the age of 18 back in 2011.

A strong loan spell at Celta Vigo in La Liga last season has seen him trusted in the first team at the Nou Camp but he will have to impress more if he is to keep his place once the likes of Neymar and Luis Suarez come back into the fold.

Promising: Rafinha might not have made the difference against Elche but he completed an academy frontline

Andres Iniesta 

Position: Centre midfielder

Age: 30

Still one of the best midfielders around, Iniesta is now in his 13th season with Barcelona's senior side and his powers show no sign of waning.

Those clever one-twos, darting runs and crisp passes were all on show against Elche as he helped Barca to dominate possession even despite having 10 men for the entirety of the second half.

He was first spotted by the Catalan club at the age of just 12 - and after struggles to adapt to life away from his parents he rose through the ranks to graduate from La Masia, which he later spoke of the philosophy of, saying: 'Receive, pass, offer, receive, pass, offer.'

He is one of the club's four homegrown captains and will remain a legend at the club long after he retires following a career that has already yielded a World Cup, two European Championships, six La Ligas and three European Cups - and he's still in his prime.

Long-time hero: Andres Iniesta is in his prime and has long been regarded as one of Europe's best midfielders

Sergio Busquets

Position: Defensive midfielder

Age: 26

While his diving and theatrics often steal the headlines, Busquets remains one of the best defensive midfielders around after forcing Yaya Toure out of the Barcelona side at the age of just 22.

Born in Barcelona, he was promoted to Barca's B team by Pep Guardiola before eventually starring in the now-Bayern Munich boss's all-conquering tiki-taka side.

He has now inherited the No 5 shirt from Carles Puyol and, entering the typical best years for a midfielder, the only way is up for the midfield hard-man.

Class: Sergio Busquets provides another line of defence in midfield but also boasts some tidy passing

Jordi Alba

Position: Left back

Age: 25

The one that got away - almost. Alba was released by Barcelona at the age of 16 after being deemed not good enough before his time with Valencia convinced his former employers to splash out £11m on the left back.

Alba found himself playing football in Barcelona's other Nou Camp - the 1,500-capacity home of local side UE Cornella before joining Valencia's reserves in a deal costing less than £5,000.

But his rise to become one of the best modern full backs saw Barca take him back as a full Spanish international and he is now back at home as a fixture for club and country.

Sergio Roberto

Position: Centre midfielder

Age: 22

A substitute for the last 10 minutes against Elche, Sergio Roberto was picked over the legendary Xavi to take to the field by Enrique.

Born just down the road in Reus he has been at the club since the age of 14 but has so far failed to nail down a place in the first team - although that's no mean feat when the likes of Xavi, Fabregas, Iniesta and Busquets have all been rivals.

Substitute: Sergio Roberto came off the bench with Barcelona already 3-0 up over Elche

Pedro

Position: Winger

Age: 27

Speedy wideman who offers something a little more direct than the typical tiki-taka style at the Nou Camp.

Despite joining at the age of 17 Pedro fought his way through the B and C sides to become a first team regular and two-time European Cup winner.

However, he has spoken of his fear at being forced out of the club this summer and the 27-year-old's days could be numbered. 

Pace: Pedro burns his marker Sergio Lopez with a run down the wing for Barcelona, appearing as a sub

Marc Bartra

Position: Centre back

Age: 23

Critics tend to focus on Barcelona's lack of defensive options as the reason for Bartra's place in the squad but a new three-year deal signed last season shows the value he holds at the Nou Camp.

He has appeared at four different youth international levels for Spain as well as making his full debut last year for the European champions against Equatorial Guinea.

Javier Mascherano's sending off against Elche might give him a shot at first-team opportunities under Enrique - and maybe he can finally justify his agent's claim that he is '25,000 times better than Alex Song'. 

Quality: Barcelona haven't bought many defenders in recent years which has increased Marc Bartra's play time

Sandro Ramirez

Position: Forward

Age: 18

Labelled as a 'classic No 9' despite standing at just 5 ft 9 ins, Ramirez is highly rated by Barca and was used extensively in pre-season and even managed to grab goals against HJK Helsinki and Leon.

He has been likened to David Villa and has a lethal touch in front of goal, scoring at every level at which he has represented Barcelona and Spain.

While it might be hard to break through at an elite European outfit, at the age of just 18 Ramirez can only learn from training regularly with the best in the form of Luis Suarez, Messi and Neymar. 

Only 18? Sandro Ramirez turned out for Barcelona in pre season vs Napoli but was on the bench against Elche

Jordi Masip

Position: Goalkeeper

Age: 25

Third-choice goalkeeper at Barca, Masip was only on the bench due to the injury suffered by summer signing Marc-Andre ter Stegen.

He was only promoted from the Barcelona B squad ahead of this season and was frequently a back-up even with the club's second string.

Martin Montoya

Position: Right back

Age: 23

There's no place like home for Montoya - he is just 23 but he has been with the La Liga runners-up for 15 years.

He has been linked with moves away from the club in the past but remains a constant in the squad despite only being back-up to Dani Alves.

Touch of class: But Martin Montoya was not required by Luis Enrique off the Barcelona bench

Xavi Hernandez

Position: Centre midfielder

Age: 34

This year will almost certainly be the last that European football is graced with pass-master Xavi's presence.

A move to the USA or Middle East beckons but even off the bench the 133-cap Spaniard can provide something for this Barcelona side. It's incredible to think he has now been with the club for 23 years.

Club legend: Xavi Hernandez almost left Barcelona this summer but he is sticking around for now
