It was more subdued than the celebrations which used to follow his goal-scoring. 

But yesterday Paul Gascoigne managed a thumbs-up after spending the Bank Holiday weekend in hospital.

The 47-year-old seemed in better shape when he appeared in a short-sleeved shirt outside Poole Hospital – and the most important goal now will undoubtedly be improving his health.

He was barely recognisable on Thursday when he was seen wandering the streets clutching a bottle of gin and cans of beer.

It
 is thought he had been on a three-week binge at his rented apartment in
 the exclusive Sandbanks, Dorset, in the latest chapter of his long 
battle with alcoholism.

Friends told The Sun how he had been drinking for three weeks in his house, which they said stank of urine and vomit.

One
 said: 'He'd been drinking for about three weeks', while another added 
'I saw him drinking neat gin straight from the bottle in his bed. He was
 off his face, a proper mess.'

The ex-Tottenham star was dressed in a 
white shirt and jeans, his hair combed back, and carried a 
Transformers-branded carrier bag.

He was taken to hospital ‘for his own safety’ after an onlooker called 999.

Yesterday the footballer was seen having a cigarette outside the hospital before he returned home in a mini-van.

Gascoigne 
was more smartly dressed when he arrived back from hospital, having 
previously been pictured in baggy shorts and a tee-shirt, although he 
was still sporting his slippers.

The
 former England midfielder – who played for Tottenham Hotspur and 
Newcastle – was accompanied by a woman and kept his head down as he 
walked into the block of flats, before appearing briefly on the balcony.

It is not known whether he will stay at the apartment or seek further help at a rehabilitation centre.

safety' after being found drinking on the street

The
 ex-England midfielder has been plagued by alcohol and drug problems and
 was spotted last Thursday with his head in his hands following a suspected drinking 
binge in Sandbanks, Dorset, last week

Shortly before the ambulance had whisked him away, at 3pm, the former England star was seen calling a friend to plead: ‘I’m in trouble, please can you come and help me?’

He had been observed drinking in public on several occasions in preceding days, and at lunchtime on Tuesday was videoed by a passer-by in what appeared to be an inebriated state, in central Bournemouth.

Meanwhile, Gascoigne was also facing homelessness after being told he must quit his £3million penthouse apartment.

A string of 'noise complaints' by neighbours was thought to have been what led to the ultimatum.

The director of the management company in charge of the flats dismissed claims he was being forced to leave, but said his landlord was not renewing the rental contract.

Christopher Eales, 84, said: 'The only thing I can tell you is that he has not been asked to leave.

'His lease will run out on September 13 and the landlord will not be renewing the contract as he wants the flat back.'

It had been claimed that Gascoigne was set to make his return to football after a journey for cigarettes led him to meet taxi driver and Abbey FC manager Chris Foster - who convinced the former England international to sign for the Hayward Sunday League side.

The 47-year-old enjoyed a memorable professional career which saw him play for the likes of Newcastle United, Tottenham Hotspur, Lazio and Rangers, whilst also becoming a firm favourite among many England supporters.

Gascoigne, who has been plagued by alcoholism and drug addiction, last played professional football ten years ago when he made four appearances for then-League Two side Boston United.

Last week Gascoigne's former teammates rallied around him as the star was admitted to Poole Hospital.

Chris Waddle, who played in the 1990 World Cup where Gascoigne made his name, took to Twitter to offer his support.

He tweeted: 'I know it's hard to stay focused but you have so many people who want you to come through this come on stay strong'

Above a picture of the pair playing together for England, he then added: 'Love you mate'.

Another of Gascoigne's Italia '90 teammates, Match of the Day Presenter Gary Lineker, also offered a serious message for the troubled star.

In comments reported in the Daily Record, he said: 'Ultimately the support has got to come from Gazza himself.

'We've supported him over years, Tottenham and his friends. I wish him well but ultimately it's got to come from Paul.'
