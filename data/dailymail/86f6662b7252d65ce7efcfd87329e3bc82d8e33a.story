Home Office staff have given British passports to tens of thousands of illegal immigrants and foreign criminals - including at least one murderer, a damning report revealed yesterday.

Officials have failed to carry out even basic checks on more than 200,000 migrants applying for British citizenship every year, it said.

The shambles allowed criminals and others with ‘very poor immigration histories’ to obtain a passport – allowing them access to the jobs market, benefits and public services.

Inspectors unearthed one case in which staff accepted an application from an asylum-seeker – unaware that he had admitted a fatal stabbing in his homeland.

Chief border inspector John Vine discovered an asylum seeker who admitted to immigration officials that they had stabbed someone to death in their home country but was still allowed to become a British citizen

Of the 235,000 applications in 2013, the refusal rate was only 3 per cent – three times lower than in 2007.

And with two million passports handed out over the past decade, critics said the potential scale of the scandal is enormous – with up to 12,000 cases being wrongly approved every year.

Last night the Home Office was frantically working to withdraw the citizenship granted to the killer.

Mr Vine’s report – which was handed to Home Secretary Theresa May on September 1 but only released by the Home Office yesterday – found rules were routinely ignored. He said ‘no attempts’ were made to check an applicant’s criminal record. Bizarrely, if an applicant volunteered information about a conviction, it was ignored if the Home Office could not independently verify the information.

There were ‘virtually no other checks’ to establish the good character of applicants, the inspection found.

Rules state that those seeking citizenship must not breach British immigration laws at any time during the five years leading up to their application, unless there are exceptional circumstances.

The report by chief inspector of borders John Vine found that: 

But officials were routinely ignoring a poor history of evading controls – such as entering Britain illegally or working without permission – a ‘blanket policy’ that was applied without ministerial approval.

Officials also took a lax attitude to those caught cheating the rules or who were bankrupt.

In one case, officials made the ‘very poor decision’ not to revoke the citizenship of someone who used forged documents.

There were also ‘significant delays’ in dealing with allegations concerning deception.

The report heaps huge new pressure on Theresa May after a string of scandals involving foreign criminals and border failures. Mr Vine claims a string of damning reports have been suppressed and is standing down at the end of the year, apparently in protest. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper accused Mrs May of ‘sitting on the report for months’ and called on her to reveal exact numbers of those awarded citizenship without proper checks.

She added: ‘When Home Office failures allow murderers to get British citizenship the Home Secretary should take action and not seek to manage the bad news.’

Campaign group MigrationWatch called the situation a ‘shambles’. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, called the ‘shocking’ report the ‘most damming I have seen emanate from the chief inspector’s office’.

Immigration and security minister James Brokenshire said the Government was still clearing up the ‘mess’ it inherited – including Labour’s decision in 2007 to grant large numbers the right to remain in Britain indefinitely even if they did not meet the rules.

Migrants who have flouted immigration laws will now be banned from becoming British citizens for at least ten years, he announced. A spokesman for Number Ten called the case of the foreign killer being granted citizenship ‘regrettable’.

To get hold of a British passport, a migrant first needs to gain citizenship.

To qualify for that first stage, applicants must be of ‘good character, able to communicate in English and not have been in breach of immigration rules while living in the UK’.

In recent years, migrants’ English has been tested by requiring them to sit an exam or sitting the ‘Life in the UK’ test – a multiple choice quiz on British history, laws and public services.

The final decision is taken by the Home Office’s Nationality Casework team – which is the department inspected by John Vine for yesterday’s devastating report.

Once approved, the applicant is expected to attend a citizenship ceremony and swear an oath of allegiance to the Queen.

Citizenship gives full access to Britain’s jobs market, benefits and state services. The rules on British citizenship are supposedly strict to reflect the huge rights and benefits it conveys.

But, with passports being handed out at a record rate of more than 200,000 every year, it has also turned into a huge money-spinner for the Home Office.

On average, the cost of processing an application is £144. The cost to a migrant of applying is £906 – a profit of £762. In 2013, the Home Office raked in £152million dealing with citizenship claims.
