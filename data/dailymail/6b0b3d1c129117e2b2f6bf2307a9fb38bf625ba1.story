In a TV interview, Hillary revealed details of her tense first meeting with Barack Obama after the primaries in 2008, and said when he first offered to make her Secretary of State she turned it down

Hillary Clinton has spoken about what it was like seeing Barack Obama for the first time after losing their bitter run-off battle in 2008.

She described the meeting as being 'like an awkward first date between teenagers' saying the pair decided to clear the air after a brutal campaign which saw personal attacks from both sides.

She said: 'We met and it was like an awkward first date between teenagers. We had a glass of wine, which helped, and tried to clear the air.

'What I told him was actually how I felt. It had been hard fought, he won I lost and I was going to do everything I could to get him elected President.'

Speaking on This Morning in the UK, she also described the moment Obama decided to offer her the Secretary of State job after he won the presidential race against John McCain.

She said she was aware that there were rumors the President elect would offer her a job, but she dismissed them as just rumors until she was called to the White House.

Despite being bowled over by the surprise offer, she added that she initially turned it down before later accepting.

During the wide-ranging interview, she also told hosts Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford that she hasn't decided whether to run for president herself in 2016.

Hillary said that, as she was just about to become a grandmother, she was weighing up whether to run against the time she would get to spend wit her family - saying that part of what made her hesitate was being too familiar with the role.

However, when speaking about her new book, she highlighted chapters on gay rights and women's rights, calling both areas 'unfinished business' - perhaps hinting at possible campaign policies.

On the 
issue of family, Hillary agreed that professional women faced a burden 
of guilt when sacrificing time with their children for time in the 
office, but urged people to try their best to fit both in.

She
 said that things had not always gone perfectly with her own daughter, 
but added that she was very glad to have become a mother.

Speaking with hosts Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford about her husband Bill, she said she 'knew he was trouble' and turned down his proposal of marriage twice before accepting

Speaking about husband Bill, she said she 'knew he was trouble' from the start, and said she turned down his marriage proposals twice before finally agreeing.

Asked about her decision to stay with him after it was revealed he had been unfaithful, Hillary said it had been a difficult choice, but ultimately turned out to be the right choice.

She added: 'It is such an individual choice. For me it was a very hard choice but the right choice, to choose forgiveness and continue what had become a central part of both of our lives.

'I am very grateful that was the decision I made but I respect people who make the other choice.

'When you are in public and people are throwing their views at you, you really have to be very conscious of just listening to your own heart and not judging prematurely and that was challenging.'

The interview forms part of her book promotion tour which is taking place worldwide, and included Radio interviews yesterday in which she made an embarrassing gaffe - confusing the names of Britain's main political parties.

Speaking to Jenni Murray on women's hour, she suggested the Tories and Conservatives were opponents - when in fact the two names refer to the same party.
