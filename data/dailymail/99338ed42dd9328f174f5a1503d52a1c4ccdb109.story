An Oregon woman being
monitored for possible Ebola infection has been hospitalized
after registering a high temperature, state health officials
said on Friday.

The woman, who was being monitored after traveling to an
Ebola-affected country, has been placed in isolation and is not
a danger to the public, the Oregon Health Authority said.

The worst outbreak of the disease on record has killed
nearly 5,000 people, all but a handful in the impoverished West
African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

Calming fears: There is no risk to the public, according to health officials such as Dr. Paul Lewis (pictured) who did not release specifics regarding her identity or the timeline of her return to Portland from Africa

Julie Sullivan-Springhetti of the Multnomah County Health Department said the patient  traveled from West Africa to the Portland area and had been self-monitoring for symptoms was hospitalized and quarantined after developing a fever, the Oregon Health Authority said. 

They woke up on Friday and after taking their temperature and learning it was over 102 degrees, was taken in a specially-equipped medical transport vehicle to Providence Milwaukie Hospital.

There is no risk to the public, according to health officials, who did not release specifics regarding her identity or the timeline of her return to Portland from Africa. 

They said she visited one of the the three Ebola-stricken countries (Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia), but did not specify which one.

Health officials said the patient was brought to Providence Milwaukie because it was available and prepared. 

'Safe care for patient, safety for health care workers, and safety for the general public,' said Dr. Paul Lewis.

The people who live with the patient are now under a voluntary home quarantine.

Health officials said testing is being obtained by a laboratory and will be sent to the CDC who will have to confirm the results. The timeline for the results is unknown and officials said, 'It will take time for them to run and confirm the tests.'

There are a 'couple' patients who are currently being monitored for Ebola in Oregon currently, and this woman was one of those cases, health officials said. 

Plan of action: Earlier in the week Governor John Kitzhaber, right, standing next to next to health officials, designated six hospital systems as the go-to centers for treatment in case a person is suspected of Ebola

The Oregon isolation comes as a judge rejected Maine's bid
for a quarantine on a nurse who treated victims of the disease
in West Africa but tested negative for it.

The judge instead
imposed limited restrictions.

Also on Friday the Pentagon said that civilian U.S. defense
employees returning from Ebola relief work in West Africa must
undergo monitoring to ensure they are free of disease but can
choose between following civil health guidelines or the stricter
military regimen.
