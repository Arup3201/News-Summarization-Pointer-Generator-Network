Manchester United starlet Andreas Pereira has been linked with a move to Juventus after refusing to commit his long-term future to the club.

The 19-year-old, who has been tipped to follow Paul Pogba to the Juventus Stadium, made his Manchester United debut in their embarrassing 4-0 defeat by MK Dons in August - but has not made another first team appearance since.

Here, Sportsmail tells you everything you need to know about the Brazilian starlet.

I've never heard of him

Chances are, unless you're an avid viewer of MUTV or regular visitor to United's Under 21 matches you won't have. He's a Belgium-born Brazilian winger/attacking midfielder who has made just one appearance for the senior team.

That came on that miserable night in the land of the concrete cows when United had their rumps spanked 4-0 by MK Dons.

The fate of those who pulled on a red shirt that evening is well documented. Pereira has not been seen in the first-team squad since.

Is he good?

Ander Herrera would seem to think so. Only this week the recently-restored midfielder singled out Pereira for praise.

'I didn't know how good the academy is here,' the Spaniard gushed.

'Adnan Januzaj and Andreas Pereira are young players for Manchester United that are going to be very important players for many years.'

Like Herrera, Pereira is not the biggest but has quick feet a keen eye for a pass and clips in an accurate cross. He is also a sharp cookie and can speak Spanish and French as well as Portuguese and English. Despite his tender years Pereira is known as something of a dressing room translator.

So he's going to be a United great?

That's the thing. Pereira's contract is up at the end of the season and there is a giant Paul Pogba-like shadow looming large.

Paul Pogba?

Yes. Italian giants Juventus are rumoured to be sniffing around in a bid to tempt the youngster to Turin. We have seen this before. In 2012, angered at a lack of first-team opportunities (sound familiar?), Frenchman Pogba risked the wrath of Fergie and made the switch to Italy. 

He has not looked back and is now a regular for the Grand Old Lady and his national side. This summer bids are expected to flood in and there is even talk of £80million offers from the likes of Arsenal to bring him back to the Premier League. He is the one that got away.

Is Pereira aware of this?

He is - and is even thought to have broken bread with the enfant terrible who dared to stand up to Fergie. Earlier this week he told Tuttosport that he had spoken with Pogba 'many times'. 'He is a good friend and he told me that I would be well served in moving to Turin,' he added. Yikes.

And it is not just Juve - Pereira claims his agent is currently evaluating a number of offers, with Paris St Germain also thought to have expressed an interest.

Would he be a big loss?

Time will tell. As we know, Louis van Gaal is not the biggest fan of width and Pereira likes to head for the flanks. The 19-year-old can justifiably claim that one appearance in Milton Keynes does not represent an opportunity to showcase his talents and it would come as no surprise if he followed in Pogba's footsteps. 

Fergie saw enough back in 2011 to personally persuade Pereira that his future was in Manchester and he wasn't a bad judge of a player, was he?
