For centuries, dogs have been man's best friend, whether it was for companionship, hunting or protection. 

And now 21st century pets are being used to help humans with difficult illnesses to lead a more normal life.

Jacob Owens, eight, from Peterborough, struggles with a severe form of autism that makes it difficult to communicate or express feelings in a way that is understood by others. 

Jacob and his dog Minta, who transformed his life. Until she arrived, the eight-year-old struggled to communicate with other humans. A severe case of autism left him often isolated from others. 

It that meant for many years, he rarely even smiled and had no friends.

Even a trip to the local shops could result in terrible distress, because every aspect of Jacob's life needed to be regimented in order for him to be comfortable. 

It meant that as the years passed, he led an increasingly lonely and isolated life as contact with new people occurred less frequently. 

His mum Susan Owens was heartbroken at having to watch her child become so sad and it seemed like there was little they could do to change the situation.

She said: 'Jacob was a very lonely little boy who had no friends, it was horrible to see how isolated and lonely he was. 

'For the family, it was difficult because everyday life would cause him great distress - even going to the shops. This meant my life had to be regimented to reduce this stress as much as possible.'

But everything changed in 2013, when Susan got in contact with the charity Support Dogs.

Through its Autism Assistance Programme, they found a Labrador called Araminta, nicknamed Minta, who would become the new family pet. 

Jacob rarely used to even smile, but since Minta arrived from Support Dogs on the Autism Assistance Programme, the transformation in his personality has been dramatic. 

In just a short while, the transformation to the whole Owens family was vast.  

Susan said: 'When Minta entered our family, our lives were changed and the change in Jacob was phenomenal.

'Firstly, there was the difference she made in everyday life. 

'Now when we need to go to the shops or want to go on a family day out we tell Jacob that Minta wants to go and he doesn’t become stressed. 

Before Minta the dog arrived, a simple trip to the shops with his mum Susan (pictured) could cause huge distress to Jacob. But now he's so confident that he's even happy to talk to strangers who ask about his pet

'Even when Minta is not around, knowing she is close by keeps Jacob happy and calm.' 

But the biggest plus to having Minta around is the change in Jacob. 

Susan said: 'Before when we went out in public, Jacob would want to be invisible. 

'He would become very distressed if people wanted to talk to him, but now the difference is incredible.

'If people stop to talk to him about Minta, he will happily stand and talk to strangers because he’s proud of her. 

'I can’t put into words how incredible this is to watch - to go from wanting to be invisible to growing in confidence in everyday and wanting the world to see you. It’s amazing!' 

Minty and Jacob are now best friends, with Jacob's mum crediting the dog with being the best medicine in the world.  

Autism Assistance Dogs are specially trained to help a child become more independent and sociable in a safe way. 

In special cases like Jacob's dogs are the only way of providing comfort to a child.  

Susan said: 'Every Jacob needs a Minta - they are best friends. 

'If Jacob is sick or sad, she is there, without being told to do this. He loves her and she loves him. Minta is the best medicine.'

Jacob and Minta have been part of the Drontal Special Roles campaign, celebrating the nation’s most treasured pets.
