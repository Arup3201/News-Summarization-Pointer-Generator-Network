A woman who beat a young child to death has been sentenced to life in prison. 

Alex Hill was just 2-years-old in July 2013 when she suffered such devastating injuries at the hands of her foster mother, Sherill Small, that she died.

Small, 55, of Cameron, Texas, had custody of the young girl after she was taken away from her biological parents by the Department of Family and Protective Services.

Tragedy: Alex Hill (above) was just 2-years-old when she died as the result of massive brain hemorrhaging 

Her distraught parents, Mary Sweeney and Joshua Hill are still working to file a suit against the state and foster agency, Texas Mentor, for placing their child in the care of Small in the first place. 

Hill had openly admitted to smoking weed at teh time the couple lost custody of their daughter, but when they tried to place her with his mother, the state intervened and gave her to Small.

Just moths later, emergency services responded to a 911 call from Small asking them to come to her house because 2-year-old Alex was not breathing.

She had severe brain hemorrhaging and was placed on life support, but taken off just two days later. 

Small was arrested and charged with murder and now, after a jury deliberated for a mere four hours on Tuesday, will go to jail for the rest of her life.

'It’s a blessing. Justice has been served,' Diann Hill, Alexandria’s paternal grandmother, told The Eagle after the trial.

Alex's parents also commented on a Facebook page they created in her honor, writing, 'I never ment [sic] for this to happen, and I miss you so much! I love you and I’m so sorry, but that evil woman is gone forever and I wish you weren’t.' 

Alex would have turned 4-years-old last Friday.
