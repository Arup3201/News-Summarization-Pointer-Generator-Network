Today show host Matt Lauer is ‘furious’ at claims that he flirted with a pretty college student while giving her career advice.

The TV stalwart, 55, took budding journalist Lucie Fink to lunch following a request from a friend.

But he has now been left seething that a friendly text exchange sparked by a message from the pretty brunette has become the subject of public scrutiny and been taken 'completely out of context.'

A close friend told MailOnline: ‘Enough is enough, Matt is so tired of this.

‘There was nothing seedy or suggestive in this meeting. Is this a message that guys should only mentor guys? Isn’t that a terrible glass ceiling?

‘This in particular hurts because the intentions were so innocent.'

Matt, a married father-of-three, met 
brunette Lucie, 20, a senior at John Hopkins University, at the behest 
of his close friend and colleague, Debbie Kosofsky, a senior producer on
the Today show.

Debbie, who has been working with Matt 
since 1986, told MailOnline: ‘The Finks are family friends of mine, so I
asked Matt as a favor to have lunch with Lucie, because she's pursuing a
career in journalism. 

‘In
my 30 years working with Matt, I have seen him mentor and help 
countless young journalists and broadcasters. He has always been 
incredibly generous with his time and advice.’

He took 
Lucie, a budding TV reporter who has made several appearances on the 
Today Show over the past 15 months, to lunch at the Four Seasons Hotel’s
restaurant in Manhattan.

‘There was nothing seedy or 
suggestive in this meeting. Is this a message that guys should only 
mentor guys? Isn’t that a terrible glass ceiling?'

And 
in a text responding to Lucie before an upcoming appearance on the NBC morning
show on July 10, published in the National Enquirer today, Matt messaged: ‘Bring 
your 'A' game tomorrow young lady. Look forward to seeing you.’

Lucie
replied: ‘You know I will!  Can’t wait. Are you the talent for the 
segment?,’ to which Matt responded: ‘Yes! I will be interviewing you. 
Don’t screw it up. And no daisy duke shorts with flip flops!’

However,
a senior source at the Today Show revealed Matt says this to ALL 
interns – calling it his ‘pet peeve’ when youngsters turn up for their 
big break dressed for the beach.

Matt
met Lucie for lunch two months ago, however his friend said:  ‘This 
notion of Matt ‘whisking’ Lucie out for lunch is ludicrous.

‘It
was arranged by Debbie, Matt’s dearest friend on the show. They have 
worked together for 30 years and Lucie is good friends with Debbie’s son
Jeffrey.

‘The reason Lucie 
has done appearances on the Today Show is because of Debbie and she told
Matt ‘Listen, I’m asking a huge favour, could you 
please have lunch with her, she needs advice on several internships 
she’s weighing up’.

‘Matt would do anything for Debbie, so of course he agreed. He did not initiate this lunch.’

The
friend revealed that Matt holds all his business lunches at the Four 
Seasons, saying: ‘Matt 
is at that restaurant twice a week – he must 
have had between 50 and 70 lunches there alone this year – that’s just 
where he goes.

‘Just last 
week, Matt was there with six Today Show producers, he’s taken his 
executive producer there as well as Savannah Guthrie and Ted Koppel – 
it’s his lunch spot.’

However,
Matt is particularly upset by the notion that he shared flirty texts 
with Lucie, whose father is veteran New York DJ Jimmy Fink.

 ‘Matt was 
never thinking about her in sexy clothing – the message was the 
opposite..you have to remember to present yourself 
professionally’

‘Matt
speaks to all the interns,’ said the senior Today Show source: ‘He takes
an active role in helping them and every year he speaks to all the NBC 
News interns.

‘And one of the 
stories he tells at every one of these meetings is how, 35 years ago, as
an intern at WOWK-TV in Huntington, Virginia, he only had two 
sports jackets, and rotated them every day, so people would know that he
took the job seriously.

‘What he’s been dismayed by over the years is that he has noticed that intern attire has deteriorated.

‘At the Olympics last summer, the guys were dressed in basketball 
jerseys and the girls were in the equivalent on Daisy Duke shorts and 
flip flops.

‘He says ‘you must show up looking professional, as if you’re going on a job interview’.’

Matt
gave this same advice to Lucie at their lunch, according to his friend,
and she even relayed the story to her dad when she got home. ‘Matt was 
never thinking about her in sexy clothing – the message was the 
opposite, he told her ‘you have to remember to present yourself 
professionally’, said the friend.

Lucie often went to producers with ideas for segments, including one for teens making money by tutoring online to make extra money - and which was put on air on July 10.

Even her father Jimmy told the Enquirier Matt had been nothing but supportive to his daughter, adding their dealings had been 'professional and appropriate'. He said: 'Lucie has a steady boyfriend and sees Matt as someone who's trying to help her.My wife and I couldn't be more thankful for his help and support.'

‘Matt 
mentors several people here,’ said the source:  ‘Not just women. Does 
anyone write a story about him taking a six foot-tall guy to lunch – no. And 
by the way he did that recently!'
