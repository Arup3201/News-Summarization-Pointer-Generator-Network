A pensioner claiming to be Heather Mills' forrmer chauffeur has been fined after being caught using a photocopy of her disabled parking badge.

Stewart Simonson was caught out after traffic wardens recognised the picture on his permit 'was someone on the television'.

Simonson, 65, said he photocopied the blue badge with Ms Mills' 'full knowledge and consent' as he was confronted about his Smart car parked on a yellow line in north London.

He was ordered to pay a total of £660 - including a £175 fine - by Enfield magistrates after admitting using the permit six months after finishing working for the former model.

Stewart Simonson, 65, from Enfield, told police he was a former driver for Heather Mills

Mr Simonson claimed he had permission from Ms Mills to have a copy of her blue badge

He said he copied the badge because Ms Mills, whose marriage to Sir Paul McCartney ended in an acrimonious court battle in 2008, often forgot the original when she travelled to London.

Simonson, who did not appear in court, admitted the offence under the road traffic act, Robert Redmond, a lawyer representing Enfield Council, told Jenny Brown, chairman of the bench.

Simonson, from John Gooch Drive, Enfield, had said he had only used the permit 'on a spur of the moment' after stopping to pick up painkillers and a watch battery, Mr Redmond added.

Mr Redmond said: 'Because she would forget to bring her parking card he had made a photocopy with her knowledge and consent.

'He said he had intended to return it to her “if he saw her”. He didn’t return it to Brighton because he didn’t want to get her into trouble.

'It would appear he was unlucky as he said it was the first and only time he used the card.'

Simonson, of Enfield, wrote a letter to the court in which he said: 'I was employed as a chauffeur by a lady who was awarded a disabled badge.

'On occasion she would forget to bring the badge, therefore I made a copy.

'I suffer from arthritis which forced me to retire nine months ago. Six weeks before this I had been discharged from hospital and am in constant pain and unable to walk any distance and applied for a badge myself.'

On the day of the offence he had been home alone and had been in a lot of pain so drove to the supermarket to get some tablets then stopped to get his watch battery changed and had used the badge to park on the single yellow line which is restricted between 8am and 6pm, he claimed.

He said: 'I would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused.'

Simonson, who said he was in the process of applying for his own blue badge, had parked his car illegally on Lodge Avenue, near a supermarket, the court heard.

Suspicions were raised about the permit when traffic officers looked at the hologram.

Mr Redmond told the court: 'They recognised that the person in the permit to be someone they had seen on television.'

Heather Mills separated from Paul McCartney in 2006 in an acrimonious split that was settled in the courts

Enfield Council is taking a 65-year-old man to court for allegedly using a photocopy of Heather Mills' blue badge to park illegally. In interview he claimed to be her former chauffeur.

Chris Bond, of Enfield Council, said Simonson's use of the permit was a 'despicable crime'.

'This prosecution shows we will not hesitate to take action against people who defraud and rob from the disabled,' he added.

'Enfield Council is absolutely committed to bring blue badge cheats to book and anyone who attempts this type of crime in our borough can expect us to act swiftly and firmly against them.'

Ms Mills was granted the badge by Brighton authorities because she has a prosthetic leg.

She was hit by a police motorbike and suffered serious injuries, losing part of her left leg, six inches below her knee in London in 1993.

She met Sir Paul McCartney at a Pride of Britain charity event, and they were married in June 2002 and gave birth to Beatrice Milly McCartney in October 2003.

She separated from the former Beatle in 2006, which led to a highly publicised divorce in which she was awarded £24.3million in a court settlement in March 2008.
