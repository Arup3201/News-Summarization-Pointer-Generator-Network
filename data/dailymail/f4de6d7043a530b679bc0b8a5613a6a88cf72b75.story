Soaring childcare costs in the UK are prompting more mothers than ever to start their own businesses from home.

A new survey has found that two thirds (65 per cent) of mothers with children under the age of ten are considering launching their own business in the next three years. 

The dramatic rise in childcare costs mean that the annual expense of full-time childcare is £11,700 for two children.

Working mothers: 49 per cent of mothers questioned in a new survey believe that they would be financially better off if they started a business from home

The research, by insurers Direct Line, found that nearly half of mothers questioned - 49 per cent - believe that they would be financially better off if they started a business from home.

One in five British mothers say they (20 per cent) also believe they'd be able to spend more time with their children if they didn't have to go in to an office every day.

One in six (16 per cent) think they'd save money on childcare if they eschew traditional nine-to-five, office-based jobs.

One in seven mums (14 per cent) are motivated to start a business from home by the flexibility of being their own boss.

One in eight (12 per cent) have always had the ambition to start their own business.

Only one per cent is motivated by the fact that they do not like their current job.

Jazz Gakhal, Head of Direct Line for 
Business, said: 'The costs of sending a child to day care, or hiring
 a nanny continue to spiral.

'It’s great to see that mums are tackling 
this problem with such an entrepreneurial spirit, as they understand 
considerable child care cost savings can be made by running a business 
from home.'

Kerry Marriott, 37, and Rachael Forder, 42, from Southsea, Hampshire, used their mothering skills to think up a lucrative business and, in 2012, successfully launched the LumiPotti: a potty which lights up to help young children with toilet training.

They thought of the idea when they realised their own youngsters were finding it difficult to locate the toilet in the dark.

'Rachael used a transparent potty with a night light underneath and I plugged a night light in to the wall nearby,' Kerry told Mail Online.

'Our children liked the idea that they could get up and find the potty on their own at night. They were quite proud of themselves.

'It wasn’t 100 per cent fool proof but it proved really effective. We started telling other parents about the method and they said it had worked for them.'

The LumiPotti successfully sells online and the women hope to make it a 'global brand.'
