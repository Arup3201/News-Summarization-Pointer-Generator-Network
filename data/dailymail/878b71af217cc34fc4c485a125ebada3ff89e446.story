Disturbing footage has emerged showing a masked child firing an AK47 assault rifle while shouting Islamic slogans in Syria.

Two short videos apparently filmed in Ghouta, a rural suburb of the capital Damascus, were uploaded to YouTube by an user calling themselves Abd Sad.

They show a young boy, who appears no older than six-years-old, being instructed to fire the weapon by an adult male who then praises him and encourages him to join in religious chanting.

Disturbing: The footage shows a masked child firing an AK47 assault rifle while shouting Islamic slogans. It was apparently filmed in Ghouta, a rural suburb of the Syrian capital Damascus

Child: The young boy, who appears no older than six-years-old, is instructed to fire the weapon by an adult male who then praises him and encourages him to join in religious chanting

The footage, the authenticity of which could not be immediately established, was posted on YouTube last week by a user who has also uploaded an pro-ISIS propaganda video.

Describing the child as a 'cub cub' the video captions suggest they were filmed in southern Ghouta - a collection of farms on the outskirts of Damascus near to where Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad is believed to have carried out a brutal chemical weapons attack a year ago that left hundreds dead.

Throughout the clips the young boy appears unsteady on his feet under the weight of the large gun - and each time he fires the weapon he looks close to toppling over thanks to its powerful recoil.

When he stops firing, the young boy turns towards the camera as if looking for praise as an adult man encourages him to chant religious slogans.

ISIS - which rebranded as Islamic State earlier this year after establishing a self-described caliphate in the vast swaths of Syria and Iraq under its control - has long groomed children to take part in jihad.

The practice was the subject of the second episode of VICE's groundbreaking 'Islamic State' documentary series, in which very young boys were seen being asked whether they want to be a suicide bomber or a jihadist, and were forced to repeat calls for the murder of Western 'infidels'.

In the footage, ISIS' PR man Abu Moussa - who has since been killed - describes how every male child under the age of 15 is forced to attend a 'Sharia camp' to be taught the militant group's radical interpretation of Islam.

At the age of 16 the boys are sent to a military camp, where they are given intensive training in the art of warfare and prepared for possible future as either front-line militia or suicide bombers.

This nine-year-old self-described ISIS 'fighter' said he was about to be sent away for training at a military camp. When asked what his training consisted of, the boy replied 'The Russian' - meaning Kalashnikov assault rifle

This morning Amnesty International accused ISIS of carrying out a systematic campaign of mass killings, abductions and ethnic cleansing in northern Iraq that could amount to war crimes.

The London-based rights group says the extremists, who overran parts of northern and western Iraq in June, have systematically targeted religious minorities.

In today's report Amnesty said ISIS fighters have expelled Christians, Shiites, Yazidis and other minority groups from their homes 

The report documents several cases where the militants carried out mass killings of Yazidi men, rounding up men and boys and killing them in groups.

The report also documented the abduction of hundreds of Yazidi women and children. It says the fate of most of the abducted women and children is still unknown.
