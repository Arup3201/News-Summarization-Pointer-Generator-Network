Money worries, dead-end relationships and unfulfilling jobs were among the reasons many Brits said they were fed up, a blu eCig study revealed

We're shivering in the sleet, struggling to pay Christmas bills and all those New Year's resolutions have gone up in smoke.

No wonder we're a nation of miseries. Just three in ten of us are happy with our lives, a study has revealed.

Money worries, dead-end relationships and unfulfilling jobs were among the reasons many said they were fed up. 

The study of 2,000 people found that 69 per cent feel trapped in the same old routine and more than 40 per cent are unhappy with their lives.

Lifestyle niggles, worrying about their image and even the British weather were listed among the top 20 reasons for feeling worried, with nearly three-quarters succumbing to the winter blues.

Just seven per cent described themselves as very happy with their image, while a confidence-lacking 40 per cent of people are actively unhappy with the way they look, results showed.

Commissioned by blu eCigs, the study revealed that the majority of people don't make changes to their lives because they struggle to know where to start.

Jacob Fuller, CEO of blu eCigs, said 'A lot of people set out to make changes to their lives in January but find it a struggle and end facing a case of the January blues.

'The results show that making smaller, positive lifestyle changes rather than setting drastic unattainable targets is the best route to improve overall happiness.'

Relationship stresses also take their toll - results found one in five feels their relationship has declined in recent times, while the same number felt there isn't a future with their current partner.

And work life brings little respite - nearly a quarter don't feel they're going anywhere in their job.

Just a quarter of people felt their career had gone to plan and were actually able to do the job they originally hoped to do.

The study, titled the 2015 UK Optimism Audit, found that while more than three-quarters of people think that New Year's resolutions are ineffective, most of us do see the value in making incremental changes to our lives.

Seventy per cent believe that changing just one small thing would make an improvement to their happiness levels.

The majority don't make changes to their lives as they struggle to know where to start.

Showing the value of small changes, half of those that smoke said swapping to an e-cig would improve their lifestyle.
