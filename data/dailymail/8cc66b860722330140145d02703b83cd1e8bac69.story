'The fact that someone would rather do that to themselves than live probably means that there's something very, very wrong with what's going on with asylum seekers,' she said.

Mr Seemanpillai was living in Geelong waiting for his protection visa application to be finalised.

Refugee support worker Cathy Bond said Mr Seemanpillai had been anxious about that possibility the day before he died.

'He said, "what will happen to me? What will happen to me if they refuse my case?",' she said of her last conversation with her friend.

But the Minister warned his critics against making 'assumptions' about what led Mr Seemanpillai to take his life in the 'terrible and tragic incident'.
