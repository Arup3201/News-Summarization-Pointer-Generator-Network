'Give her leeway to show that she's worth of compassion,' Mark Heller pleaded with Judge James Dabney this morning in a bid to get Lindsay Lohan's latest criminal case thrown out. 

The New York based lawyer even played the victim card, telling Judge James Dabney that 'there seems to be some doubt as to whether Lohan is entitled to some mercy because of her history with this department.'

But the judge wasn't buying it, and he steadfastly refused to allow Heller to persuade him to move the trial date from March 18 to April 1.

Unsuitable? Judge Dabney told Lindsay Lohan's lawyer that he was not versed sufficiently in California law to represent her properly at trial as he threw his attempts to have lying to police claims thrown out during this morning's pre-trial hearing

Noting that it was also April Fools' Day, Dabney pointed out that April 1st is a court holiday and said he saw no merit in postponing the reckoning.

He also questioned Heller's suitability to represent Lohan, 26, as it seemed to the judge as though the lawyer - who admitted he'd practised in New York for 44 years - wasn't completely versed in California law.

Heller began by questioning 'particulars', in short - he wanted to know where certain statements attributed by Lohan were made after the the June crash relating to the lying allegations.

Did Lohan - who is accused of lying to cover up the fact that she was driving recklessly - make her statement at the scene, or at hospital or to police at a later date?

The judge told Heller that he saw no need to discuss these details until trial, and added emphatically that this was all in accordance with California law.

He added that Heller had not prepared adequately given his lack of competence in California law, which meant prosecutor Terry White's trial date remained in place.

He told Heller his concerns about police not reading Lindsay her Miranda rights were of no concern, either, as Lindsay's fourth amendment rights had not been violated.

Dabney also emphasized to Heller that he needs to take local guidance before trial and that Lindsay will suffer if she doesn't have a legal team who fully understand California law.

Her father Michael was, as always, quick to comment on the matter to TMZ, he said: 'This guy is a loser and will drag her down.

'I already started to pray to God that Lindsay fires him before it's too late,' he added before explaining he has another lawyer lined up.

Back at court: Lindsay Lohan appears at a hearing with her attorney Mark Heller on January 30, 2013

Lohan was on probation at the time of the accident and she
faces jail time if a judge determines she violated her sentence in a 2011 theft
case.

It has been reported that prosecutors offered her a 'no jail' deal if she agreed to return to rehab, but she rejected it.

According to TMZ,
the Mean Girls star does not believe she has a substance abuse problem 
that warrants the condition and is risking instead to take the case to 
trial.

The website reports that Heller had a telephone conference with prosecutors on Wednesday to discuss the terms of the bargain.

Prosecutors were apparently asking for 'a significant amount of time in a residential rehab facility'.

Earlier reports suggested the plea bargain stipulates she must enroll in rehab for at least 60 days, attend AA meetings and undertake community service.

Heller reportedly did not accept the offer, although the insider says 'negotiations are ongoing'.

Lohan is said to be against the idea of going back to rehab entirely, looking at the condition as 'punishment for something I didn't do'.

Facing the music: Heller's pleas for 'compassion' and 'mercy' fell on deaf ears and Lindsay will face trial on March 18

Details of the apparent deal surfaced after the New York-based attorney sent an emotional letter pleading with prosecutors to help the 'deeply broken' actress.

Heller reveals that Lindsay is undergoing extensive psychiatric therapy and is struggling to overcome a history of family issues, and urges Santa Monica and Los Angeles City Attorneys Terry White and Spencer Hart to join forces with him to become the team that 'fix' the actress.

Sent on February 4 and obtained by TMZ, the letter was also sent to the judge presiding over the case.

Heller, who came onto the case after Lohan fired her long-term attorney, Shawn Holley, earlier this year, wrote the prosecutors need to understand that his client's problems are even deeper than what is publicly known.

'I have known Lindsay for many years and have witnessed the dynamics of her family and her experiences that are not known to general public, and which have deeply impacted her and resulted in certain events in her life that has bought her before the Court and derivatively to your attention and professional assessment,' he is quoted.

'Yet, as I noted at our meeting these prior events and their portrayal in the media, regrettably always results in distortion, creating a very negative public persona without consideration of what happened in Lindsay's life that bought her to that place and without considering the pain, torment and confusion which Lindsay has experienced and been affected with.'

The lawyer promises, alongside Lindsay's psychotherapist, to reveal just how bad things have become for the Parent Trap actress as he says that without knowing, the prosecutors are 'handicapped because he could you propose to fix something without known just how broken it was'.

'The only way we as a "team" are going to formulate a solution is for Lindsay, her Psychotherapist and I provide a true window revealing the real problems we must solve,' the letter reportedly continues.

Heller appeals to the prosecutors to consider alternatives to Lohan's previous sentences - including a lengthy probation in 2011 for stealing a necklace, which is now in jeopardy in light of the new criminal charges. 

'Which is why I appeal to your good conscious to join me in not rubber stamping this case but rather to be patient and understanding and open to productive alternatives as we, as a team, help fix Lindsay Lohan,' the letter continues.

The case is not Lohan's only legal worry.

The actress earlier this week was fined $1000 for failing to make herself available in a civil case deposition, RadarOnline reported.

Lohan was repetitively requested to attend a deposition in the civil case bought by photographer Grigor Baylan, who filed the civil lawsuit claiming he was injured when a car that the actress was riding in hit him in 2010.

The actress claimed to be out of state but was in California for her criminal cases pre-trial, according to the website.

She could face a reported 245 days in jail if she is found guilty in the criminal case.

A spokesman for Lohan has not yet responded to MailOnline's request for comment.
