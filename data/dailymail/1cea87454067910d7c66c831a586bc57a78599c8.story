John Bercow has criticised BBC chairman Lord Patten for refusing to be grilled by MPs about the broadcaster’s coverage of Europe.

The Commons Speaker insisted no one should consider themselves above parliamentary inspection, as he attacked Lord Patten’s refusal to answer questions from the European Scrutiny Committee.

MPs are furious that the Tory peer – and former European Commissioner – has three times turned down their request to discuss the subject of bias in the BBC’s coverage of the EU. Because he is a peer, Lord Patten cannot be forced to attend.

Labour MP Kate Hoey called for a debate on how Parliament could ensure Lord Patten is ‘not abusing his position as a Lord to avoid appearing before the committee’.

Mr Bercow waded in, saying: ‘Anybody who’s invited to appear before a committee of this House should do so. No one, however senior, should imagine him or herself above such scrutiny.’

Lord Patten, who earns £110,000 ‘base’ salary for a three to four day week, told MPs he would not discuss editorial decisions with them because this ‘is not consistent with the ideal of an independent Trust protecting the BBC from undue political interference’.

Bill Cash, the chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee, said that with the looming European elections and the upcoming in or out referendum on EU membership, it was vital that the BBC’s output was ‘impartial’.

‘I entirely endorse what the Speaker said. We are dealing with the fact that it is not possible to summon a member of the House of Lords to our committees but it is being proposed that this rule is modified,’ he told the Mail.

‘There are many situations in which a member of the House of Lords holds positions which involve taxpayers’ money and they are paid out of the public purse.’

A spokesman for the BBC Trust said BBC staff had appeared before the committee to deal with points on coverage.

He said: ‘In a letter to Bill Cash, Lord Patten set out why Trustees felt it would be inconsistent with the Trust’s role in protecting the BBC’s editorial independence for him to answer to the Committee for specific items and areas of BBC news coverage. BBC staff appeared before the committee to deal with these points.’
