The country best known for sheep, soggy weather and TV series Gavin & Stacey is spectacularly displayed from above in a series of photographs taken by a local photographer, and Wales enthusiast.

Michael Catania, a software development manager from Mold in North Wales, spends two hours once a month scanning the skies in his tiny plane for picturesque shots of the local countryside.

The 52-year-old said, 'The photographs highlight how beautiful the countryside is in North Wales. 

The diversity of landscape and seascapes is breathtaking.'

'I fell in love with North Wales when I went to university in Bangor and I consider myself very lucky as I have the opportunity to fly myself around the mountains and the coast.

'Once you spot what you want, you then have to consider how best to approach the best viewpoint to capture the image safely.

'I enjoy the different perspective you get from the air and sometimes I do not take a camera so the photography doesn't get in the way of just enjoying the view.' 

While not enjoying the view, Catania has captured Red Wharf Bay in Anglesey, intricate meandering tributaries, Ynys Gored Goch island and a 500ft quarry that's still in use between Llanfairfechan and Penmaenmawr, among others, in a beautiful new light. 

Boat for one?  Yns Gored Goch island is home to one detached house in the middle of the Menai Straits. The flow of water separates Angelsey from the mainland

Meandering tributaries make their way to the sea and around beached yachts at Red Wharf Bay on the North East side of Anglesey during low tide

Emerging from the depths: sandy banks break the sea's surface by the town of Beaumaris on the North East cost of Anglesey

 Never mind the sheep, look at this beautiful coastline near Bangor towards Llanfairfechan in Wales

A winding road along a rocky output known as the Great Orme. Michael Catania credits his aerial ventures with giving him a 'different perspective' on even simple scenes

A quarry in the clouds: this 500ft site is built on a steep hill between Llanfairfechan and Penmaenmawr and is still in use today

Where the magic happens.... Michael takes to the skies in his plane every month to capture some of the most amazing landscape in the world
