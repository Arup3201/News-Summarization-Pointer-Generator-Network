A teenager who was allegedly told by a police chief that an underage drinking charge would be dropped if she posed for naked photos in the  station's basement has expressed her anger that he has escaped prosecution.

Janelle Westfall, 19, was allegedly propositioned by David Seastran, the veteran former police chief in New London, New Hampshire.

She claims that in 2013 she was arrested by Seastrand as she walked home from a party - she was charged with giving a false name and for being in possession of a beer can.

Later that week Seastrand asked her to attend the police station and discussed punishment - such as community service.

But they then went into the basement of the station.

Seastrand told the Union Leader: 'He said he would grab the station's camera to shoot a series of nude photos of me, and then he'd hold it over my head for two years to be sure I didn't commit another crime.'

'That's when it was really chilling.

'He's standing there in uniform, he had his gun strapped on his side.'

She told the newspaper that Seastrand had told her if she told anyone he would deny it.

But the Colby-Sawyer student told a friend, as well as her family members who are police officers. 

Her father Todd Westfall told her to write down her account and he contacted police.

A month later Seastrand resigned as the New London police chief in April.

Court documents say the town's insurance provider paid $70,000 to Janelle on behalf of the town and Seastrand.

The attorney general's office said the allegations were disturbing, but did not rise to the level of criminal conduct.

State prosecutors said Seastrand's actions were 'abhorrent behavior and unacceptable behavior for anyone in that type of a position,' but did not file criminal charges against him. 

Seastrand has been prohibited from ever serving as a law enforcement officer again. 

The Valley News reports  that the Seastrand did not admit any wrongdoing as part of the settlement.

Westfall did not return to college in 2013 and transferred to a new college this year. 

Seastrand told the Union Leader: 'He said he would grab the station's camera to shoot a series of nude photos of me, and then he'd hold it over my head for two years to be sure I didn't commit another crime'
