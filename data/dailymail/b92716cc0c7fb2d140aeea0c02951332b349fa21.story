Polar ice is melting quicker than previously thought and threatening to raise global sea levels by a couple of centimetres - with disastrous effect, scientists have warned.

The dramatic changes could increase flooding on small tropical islands and leave penguins starving.

And Professor Karen Heywood from the University of East Anglia said it was 'probably' due to global warming.

Waters around glaciers in West Antarctica are warmer than thought, causing polar ice to melt quicker than expected. This could raise sea levels by a few centimetres, flooding islands and leaving penguins starving (stock image shown). And one researcher says the effect was 'probably' due to global warming

The new research has found that the shallow shelf seas of West Antarctica have become about half a degree warmer in the last 50 years, from 0.8 to 1.2°C (33.4 to 34.2°F).

As a result the ice caps of the region are melting quicker than ever before and sea levels are rising.

Professor Karen Heywood, from the University of East Anglia, said: 'More ice is melting and that would lead to more flooding in our country in the immediate future.

An Esa satellite recently spotted an unusual consequence of the melting of ice in Antarctica.

While rising sea levels and changing global temperatures are already thought to be a consequence of manmade climate change, the GOCE satellite - which was not intended to study the effects of a warming climate - has found that gravity is weakening where ice is melting the fastest.

The results show that the thinning ice sheet from November 2009 to June 2012 caused local variations in gravity, measured by the satellite.

The GOCE satellite burned up in Earth's atmosphere as planned in November 2013 after four years in orbit.

During its mission it measured Earth's gravity in unprecedented detail, detailing where it was weakest and strongest on the surface. 

'It means we need to think more about our flood defences. 

'We need to account for these sea level rises and make sure they are big enough.

'It could also be particularly bad for some of the tropical islands. They are some of the poorest populations in the world and they could just disappear.

'We are forecasting that the sea level might rise by a couple of centimetres which would be enough to have a big impact.'

Professor Heywood, of the university's Centre for Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences, added: 'It could also affect the krill population which might migrate elsewhere if the water is too warm.

'They are the base of the food chain and are eaten by the penguins, the seals and the whales. It would have a knock on effect for wildlife in the region.

'I don't know if there is anything the human population can do but it is something we need to take account of.'

She added: 'We can’t say it is global warming, rather than part of a natural cycle. But I suspect it probably is.

'It is among the most thorough looks at the waters in the area to date, and fits in with climate change due to anthropogenic sources.'

Scientists from the UK, Germany, America and Japan analysed data from oceanographic records dating back to 1960.

It revealed temperatures in the West Antarctic Amundsen Sea and the Bellingshausen Sea had been rising for the past 50 years.

They also found the water was less salty which has accelerated the melting and sliding of glaciers in the region.

It also reveals that other Antarctic areas could experience melting for the first time and there is no indication that this trend will reverse.

Professor Heywood said: 'The Antarctic ice sheet is a giant water reservoir.

'The ice cap on the southern continent is on average 2,100 metres [6,900 feet] thick and contains about 70 per cent of the world's fresh water.

'If this ice mass were to melt completely, it could raise the global sea level by 60 metres [195 feet].

'That's not going to happen, but it gives you an idea of how much water is stored there.

'Accelerated glacial melting in this area has been observed for some time, causing a major contribution to rising sea levels worldwide. '

The research was funded by the UK's Natural Environment Research Council.

The study, entitled 'Multidecadal warming of Antarctic waters', is being published in the journal Science.
