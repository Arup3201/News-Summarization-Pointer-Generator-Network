Cheating technique: 'Roget-ing' involves students swapping synonyms from the Roget's Thesaurus to cover up plagiarism

‘Sinister buttocks’, ‘Herculean liturgies’ and ‘bequest mazes’ may not be the phrases Peter Mark Roget expected to be created when he launched his world-famous thesaurus.

But a university lecturer has identified a new trend of ‘Roget-ing’ among students – the creation of absurd terms through ill-considered use of Roget’s Thesaurus.

They are using the technique, involving extensive synonym swapping, in a bid to hide plagiarism - but are producing baffling sentences as a result.

Chris Sadler, principal lecturer in business information systems at Middlesex University, suggested the new word after spotting several ‘Rogetisms’ in a students’ work.

After reading that ‘common mature musicians (and) recent liturgy providers are looking to satisfy…Herculean personalised liturgies’, he attempted to discover the source of the sentence’s origin.

He said: ‘Even if the sentence had made sense, it seemed out of place in (a paper on) business information systems and I was motivated to seek out the source.’

Mr Sadler eventually located the original text, which read: ‘the current big players and new service providers are looking to supply more powerful personalised services’.

He told the Times Higher Education magazine he had ‘seen quite a bit’ of ‘Roget- ing’, which he defined as ‘disguising plagiarism by substituting synonyms, one word at a time with no attempt to understand either the source or target text’.

As a result, the phrase ‘left behind’ was converted into ‘sinister buttocks’ by one student.

To ‘stay ahead of the competition’ became ‘to tarry fore of the conflict’, while ‘new market leaders’ was turned into ‘modern store guides’.

Other new phrases coined by students via ‘Roget-ing’ include ‘bequest mazes’ – a rough translation of ‘legacy networks’ which describe web networks using outdated computer formats.

Mr Sadler entered the blunders into the Times Higher Education exam howlers competition.

He said: ‘This was a sad business for me and especially (for) my student, but I do think ‘sinister buttocks’ deserves a prize.’

The winner of the annual contest was John Milliken, lecturer in education at the University of Ulster for his student’s claim that ‘the [hole in the] ozone layer was caused by a*******s. Dr Milliken said: ‘He probably meant aerosols, but then…maybe not.’

His second student blooper from this season’s marking season was a student’s declaration in a paper on vehicle emissions that ‘in future all cars (will) be fitted with Catholic converters’.

Confusion: Chris Slater, a lecturer at Middlesex University, coined the term after a number of his students handed in work with baffling sentences 

Verity Brack, information technology programme director at the University of Sheffield, entered the statement that Google was ‘one of the two main suppositories of data in the world’.

Meanwhile, Josephine Kelly, a lecturer in business and government at Aston University, was intrigued to read that the Coalition government had a ‘toff stance on tax avoidance’. She noted that the student actually meant ‘tuff’ (tough).

Peter Mark Roget, a British physician and lexicographer, published the Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases (Roget’s Thesaurus) in 1852.

He was obsessed with list-making from an early age and his work on the thesaurus arose partly from his attempt to battle depression.
