The owner and manager of a rat and reptile breeding operation were arrested Friday after rescue crews last year entered the breeding facility and encountered a sight so revolting that they needed crisis counselors to cope.

Following a tip-off in 2012, a PETA investigator worked undercover at Global Captive Breeders, a company that raised rats and snakes to be sold at pet stores and swap meets in Lake Elsinore, California. The investigator reported that some of the company's workers, including its manager, neglected thousands of animals, many of them to death, and cruelly killed countless more.

The owner, Mitchell Behm, 54, and manager, David Delgado, also known as Jose Magana, 29, have been arrested and charged with more than 100 counts each of felony animal cruelty for the way they treated the 18,400 rats and 600 reptiles rescuers found in the warehouse.

Many of the animal workers 
came out gasping for air and sickened by the heinous sights and smells, 
including a mixture of death, disease, decay and ammonia from 
accumulated urine and feces in rat bins.

Officials with the People for 
the Ethical Treatment of Animals called it the largest-ever seizure of 
animals in California.

The Riverside County district attorney filed the case Friday. A message left for Behm's attorney was not immediately returned, and a lawyer for Delgado could not be located.The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals initiated the investigation after sending an undercover operative to work at the breeding facility in Lake Elsinore, 70 miles south-east of Los Angeles, for two months in 2012.

People were throwing up because of the ammonia fumes and 'there were times you had to run outside just to catch a breath of fresh air,' she said.

People emotionally broke down and had to be excused. Several people ended up with colds and sore throats. 'I lost my voice,' she said.

'I had some idea what to expect but little could have prepared me for the overwhelming stench of death and decay you could smell from the outside of the facility. On the inside it was overpowering,' said Daphna Nachminovitch, senior vice president of cruelty investigations for PETA.

There were 18,400 feeder rats and over 600 snakes, black tree monitors, tokay geckos and sulcata tortoises, Nachminovitch said.

Most of the rats were without food in overcrowded bins and because of a faulty water system, were either drowning or dying of thirst. 'Some were literally eating each other alive,' she said.

Willa Bagwell, executive director at 
Animal Friends, was involved in the investigation since it began and 
described the scene and smell at the 3rd Street facility as 'horrific.'

'We
had animals that had been dead for weeks with maggots crawling out of 
them,' she said. 'There was terrible suffering in unimaginable 
conditions.'

Mitch 
Behm got a conditional use permit for the business in 2009, said Justin 
Carlson, a spokesman for Lake Elsinore. The city received one anonymous 
complaint about the business before PETA stepped in, Carlson said.

A whistleblower contacted PETA and the animal welfare agency sent an undercover investigator to get a job at the business. The investigator documented rats being grabbed by their tails and slammed against poles, stomped on, shot with a BB gun, frozen alive and drowned.

Nachminovitch said that the two months PETA's investigator spent at Global Captive Breeders was needed to document enough photo and video evidence to obtain a search warrant. In addition, the neglect was so far advanced by the time the whistleblower called that it would have been impossible to save the animals.The 6,100-square-foot warehouse had separate entrances to the reptile and rat rooms, but the snakes didn't fare any better than the rats, Nachminovitch said. Some of the boas and pythons were 15-feet long.

The animals were euthanized in the warehouse and taken to a rendering plant, she said.

Every rescue worker sets out to save animals, Machado said. But there is also satisfaction in giving an animal in pain a humane, peaceful passing, she said.

'I have been with PETA for 15 years and there was an unprecedented amount of active suffering while we were standing there. I am grateful we could end it,' Nachminovitch said.
