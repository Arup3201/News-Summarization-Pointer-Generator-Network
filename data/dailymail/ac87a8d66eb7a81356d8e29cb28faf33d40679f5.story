A mystery woman is yet to be identified almost three months after she was hit by a car.

The woman, who police are calling ‘Jane Doe,’ was struck by a car as she walked with a shopping cart through a busy intersection in Santa Ana, Los Angeles on October 15.

She was taken to Western Medical Center in a very critical condition and has not been able to communicate with staff since her admission.

Jane Doe: This woman is yet to be identified almost three months after she was critically injured in a road accident in Santa Ana

Two and a half months on from the collision, she remains totally dependent on hospital staff.

The woman was hit at the intersection of 4th and Lacy streets and her shopping cart contained many belongings, suggesting she may be homeless the Santa Ana Police said.

According to the Los Angeles Times, police spokesman Cpl Anthony Bertagna said: ‘But until we find out who she is, we will not know that.’

No trace: The woman's fingerprints did not return a match on local, state or federal databases and her description did not match missing persons reports

Her fingerprints did not return any 
matches on the local, state or federal databases and she did not match 
any missing persons reports in the area.

Police do believe that she lived close to the intersection where the collision occurred.

Investigators are now appealing for anyone who recognizes the woman to come forward with any information.

In a separate case, a woman who was found abandoned in a hospital waiting room in Alabama was identified after three years with no identification.

In August this year, the woman was unable to speak and was found wearing only an adult diaper and hospital gown. A tip off finally led authorities to discover that she was Edith Allen.

Now her carer Cathy Jean Thomas, of Douglasville, Gerogia faces charges of claiming more than $25,000 in Ms Allen’s social security checks over the past three years.

Because Ms Allen, who was named Sally by the medical staff who have cared for her since she was found in August 2010, did not have an identity she was unable to qualify for Medicaid. 

The 68-year-old woman, who had a urinary tract infection, and was dehydrated and malnourished when she was found, has built up medical bills of $200,000 in the past three years.
