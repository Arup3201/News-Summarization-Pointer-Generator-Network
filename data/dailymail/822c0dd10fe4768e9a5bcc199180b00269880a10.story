Watching the neighbours stroll past my house always makes me smile. Why? Because I can tell how jealous they are.

For I know they will be observing the latest costly improvements to our four-bedroom, three-storey property and furiously calculating how much it would take to do the same to their far more inferior homes. The answer? Not far off £200,000. 

My husband Matt, 32, a sports sponsorship manager, and I have spent the past four years pouring all of our savings into making sure ours is the best house on our street — because I wanted ours to be one that people stopped, stared and pointed at, for all the right reasons.

Improvement: The value of Debbi's house has increased by £350,000 following the extensive renovation work

We live in Richmond, Surrey, and our home — with its superior size, beautifully manicured garden and gleaming cream exterior — is head and shoulders above any others on our suburban street.

The improvements may have cost us £189,000 in the end, but it’s been worth it just to see the look on our neighbours’ faces.

Last week, a survey revealed that 31 per cent of Brits admit, like us, to carrying out home improvements just to ensure their property is the envy of the neighbourhood. 

Even when we bought our home for £305,000 in 2009, I made sure we invested in the shabby corner plot because I knew that it had the most potential. 

We had inherited some money and were keen to buy somewhere that would be a good long-term investment — at least, that was my husband’s main motivation. Secretly, I couldn’t bear to be the anonymous owner  of a distinctly average property, indistinguishable from the rest. I wanted to live in the most talked-about house in the area. 

But it wasn’t going to be easy on our relatively small budget. At first, all we could find were formulaic cottages which would be impossible to improve and enlarge. Then finally, after scouring property websites for months, I found the perfect project.

Before: The old-fashioned kitchen needed to be ripped out and completely remodelled

After: Debbi's kitchen now includes state-of-the-art fittings and the latest, most expensive appliances

It was, at the time, a 
scruffy-looking three-bedroom semi on a noisy main road. There had been 
so little interest in it that the asking price had dropped by £100,000 
in just six months. 

Clearly,
 the other buyers had been underwhelmed by the worn Seventies carpets, 
nicotine stains on the once-cream walls and faded flock wallpaper. Plus 
the only toilet was in the kitchen. But I had my eye on bigger things. I
 had dreams of property grandeur. 

For
 a start, this house was on a corner plot, which meant there would be 
scope for a double-storey side extension. There was a 60sq ft garden 
which could easily take it and the roof was the perfect height to add a 
loft conversion.

Subject of
 course to planning permission, this unloved property could be 
transformed from an ugly duckling of a house into a beautiful swan-like 
home. Maybe not quite a  mansion of Beckham proportions, but certainly 
something to be proud of.

Old fashioned: The house was in a dingy state and was full of retro furniture when the old owner lived there

Chic: The kitchen and sitting room have been totally revamped with modern furniture and pale walls

So we set the wheels in motion and 
offered even less than the much-reduced asking price. 'It’s not really 
what we were after,' I told the seller. 'It needs a total refurb and the
 damp is horrendous.' The seller caved and our offer of £305,000 was 
accepted. 

We moved in and lived in squalor for 
12 months while we sorted out all the paperwork. During this time I 
could sense the local sniggers. Our house was shabby and unloved — just 
what were we thinking, buying something that nobody wanted? 

'You’ll
 need a lot of paint to make that look nice,' nodded one neighbour as he
 strolled past to collect his morning paper. But I knew I’d prove him 
wrong. I hadn’t spent the last year watching back-to-back episodes of 
Property Ladder and Grand Designs for nothing. 

It
 took three months for our house to be almost demolished and re-built. 
Builders stripped the house back to the brickwork, took the roof off, 
the windows and doors came out and the side and back of the house were 
knocked off.

By now I was three months pregnant 
with our son Sam, now two, so we moved into a friend’s flat round the 
corner to escape the dust, dirt and constant drilling. 

As
 new foundations were dug and reams of scaffolding erected the 
neighbours started to gawp. Even the roof tiles were removed leaving the
 wooden beams exposed to  the sky.

Elegant: Once a poky boxroom, the master bedroom, which has its own ensuite bathroom, is now a pretty, soothing place to sleep

Grotty: The exterior needed a serious paint job but not as much as the dingy interior

'It’s
 going to be big,' speculated one neighbour as she walked past, stopping
 at my gate to admire the building site. 'Huge,' I confirmed, enjoying 
her obvious envy. 

As well 
as the double-storey extension to the back of the house, brand new 
walls, windows and roof, we extended our tiny galley kitchen to over 
300sq ft of bespoke German-designed sleek modernity.

I exploded with pride every time I looked at my luxury Rangemaster oven and freestanding Samsung double-door refrigerator. 

Our
 tiny box room became the master bedroom with over £3,000 worth of 
fitted wardrobes and a luxury en-suite bathroom. No expense was spared 
on our walk-in Grohe shower with a monsoon showerhead and Duravit 
bathroom suite.

We had
 real £2,000 oak flooring laid that covered the ground floor and a plush
 wool striped carpet up the stairs and in each of the three huge 
bedrooms.

Spacious: The huge garden was one of the reasons why Debbi and Matt thought the house had potential

Suddenly, we were
 the talk of the street. Whenever I opened the door to put the rubbish 
out, passers-by would crane their necks to get a glimpse inside.

Neighbours would stop us on the 
street and make hints about how nice it would be to come round so they 
could ‘admire’ the work. And we were always happy to oblige. What would 
be the point of doing £150,000 worth of renovation if we weren’t going 
to show it off?

I’d even 
turn on the lights  and leave the curtains open at night just so our 
neighbours could get a glimpse into our fabulous home.

At
 Christmas we were invited to an exclusive drinks soiree held by the 
most established residents on the street. Only a chosen few locals were 
invited and there was no guessing why we had been awarded our place. 

The
 neighbours couldn’t stop themselves asking for every detail of our 
house renovation. 'Didn’t you go crazy having to deal with all those 
builders?' one of them asked pointedly.

'Your
 house has been the talk of the playground,' another commented. 'We all 
thought you were mad buying that house, but now . . .' she trailed off. 

'Well, if anyone doubted me, they’re now eating their words,' I replied haughtily. Of COURSE, it’s not been without sacrifices.

We’ve blown all our savings on the house and forgone luxury holidays for wet and windy trips to the Isle of Wight.

Not
 to mention builders, plumbers and electricians stampeding through our 
house. Plus it wasn’t easy being pregnant throughout the renovations — 
my swirling hormones would get in the way of choosing the best bathroom 
tiles.

But still I wasn’t happy. I wanted to do a loft extension, so persuaded my husband to take out a £40,000 loan at the beginning of this year.

The neighbours were incredulous when the second lot of scaffolding went up. 'More work?' they  asked. 'Surely there’s nothing left to do?'

The bitter tone in their voices rather pleased me. I loved the fact we were keeping tongues wagging.Now we own the only four-bedroom house on the street and the other properties — a mixture of semi-detached houses and terraced railway properties — are shabby and poky in comparison. Plus we’ve increased our house price by £350,000. 

One of our neighbours has just put their house up for sale and I couldn’t help but wonder whether it was because they were upset about being overshadowed by us. 

One of my friends went to look around and came away saying: 'Of course, we could never buy it because any improvements we made would never be as good as yours.'

I smiled silently, knowing she was absolutely right.
