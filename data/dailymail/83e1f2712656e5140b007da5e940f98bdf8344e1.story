Father Gregory Grant sold all 17 of his new Bristol properties within a week

A Catholic priest who juggles his calling with property developing has sold all 17 of his new properties sold out within a week.

Father Gregory Grant, 63, went into business with a parishioner in 1998 and now runs the PG Group from a converted office above his Bristol church.

The company has built up a large portfolio by buying dilapidated city centre buildings and turning them into much-needed accommodation.

Their latest $3million project in the city centre has proved to be a commercial success with 15 of the 17 properties selling out on the first day, after 66 viewings.

The two and three bedroom homes, converted from a former council owned houses which had become derelict, were mainly purchased by young couples.

The properties were priced from £149,000 to £195,000 for two bedroom properties and £245,000 for a three bed unit.

Stuart Gaiger, Development Director of the PG Group, said: 'This just shows the latent demand there is in Bristol for homes that are within the reach of first time buyers.

'The demand for Champion Court underlines the importance of our decision to go ahead with the conversion of a nearby office complex into 140 one and two bed apartments which will be ready for sale next spring.'

Father Gregory has always considered God to be the 'third partner' in the business and as such gives a third of the profits to church projects.

To date the company has handed out more than £1million to charity and expects this latest success to raise that figure even further.

The parish priest of St Patrick's Church, in Redfield, Bristol, said: 'God gives you money simply so that you can give it away again.

'My idea of fun is working out the best way to make money so that we can find a way of giving it away. It's very satisfying.

'The work of the priest is often cyclical, with the same services coming around again each year.

'But the world of property management has projects, which have a beginning, a middle and an end.'

After being ordained in 1977, Father Gregory spent four years as curate at Corpus Christi Church, Weston-super-Mare, where he became involved in his first development project.

The church had an old Scout hall facing the sea and Father Gregory made £40,000 by selling it for redevelopment and using the money to build a meeting room.

Later he was appointed parish priest of St Patrick's in Bristol, which was scheduled for closure because of its decaying 65-year old church and dwindling 200 congregation.

Father Gregory opted to rebuild the church, which now has a new building, convent, 22 retirement homes and a 67-bed nursing home - and its congregation has grown to 600.

He officially launched the business in 1998 with parishioner and friend Peter Bradley in a bid to raise a small amount for their local community.

Peter Bradley died from a brain tumour a year later aged 43 and his wife Fiona took over his role as trustee.

In 2002, Father Gregory launched The Grant Bradley Trust, which helps to fight poverty in the Third World by providing housing and building schools.

Father Gregory works from 7.30am to 11pm Monday to Friday in a converted office above his church, but is still able to tend to his parishioners in the evening and weekends.
