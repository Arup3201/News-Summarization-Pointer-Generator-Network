British warplanes blasted an Islamic State terror network in Iraq yesterday killing jihadists operating underground.

RAF Tornado fighter bombers dropped 500lb Paveway IV laser guided bombs on a huge bunker and tunnel complex used by fighters avoiding coalition airstrikes.

The dug-in position was only discovered when US aircraft wiped out a vehicle belonging to militants – leading to smoke to billow from holes in the ground hundreds of metres away.

This led intelligence analysts to believe there was a much larger complex underground and they would need significant back-up.

They returned with some 30 aircraft from seven different countries and blasted the site so nothing was left behind.

Defence sources told the Mail: ‘We are not sure what they were doing under there, but they are not doing it now.

‘It was quite an extensive network, perhaps a hundred metres by a hundred metres. It was a sensible tactic to start digging underground – it was using common sense.’

The Ministry of Defence said the attack early yesterday was launched to back an offensive by Kurdish Peshmerga fighters northwest of the oil city of Kirkuk.

A statement said reconnaissance had spotted a ‘well concealed network of fighting positions and underground facilities, and confirmed that the site was well removed from any civilian communities.’

It continued: ‘Given the significance of the target, and the obstacle it posed to further peshmerga advances, aircraft from seven coalition nations conducted a comprehensive and closely coordinated attack on complex early on Wednesday.’

Fighters faced with an onslaught of hundreds of strikes against their vehicles have begun changing tactics and reducing their use of convoys.

Charlie Winter, a researcher for Quilliam Think Tank said: ‘They have been known to change tactics to try and avoid airstrikes but I hadn’t heard of them digging underground before.’

Islamist jihadists had previously ditched convoy for motorcycles, bicycles and camouflaged cars in order to avoid being targeted by airstrikes.

They also warned their fighters to stop using mobile phones so their location could not be pinpointed by western intelligence.

Earlier in the week, unmanned RAF Reaper drones discovered a bulldozer in Iraq and used Hellfire missile to destroy it.

Further details were not released for security reasons.

Defence Secretary, Michael Fallon, said: ‘The strike will have dealt a blow to the ISIL network in a key location, thus limiting their ability to pursue their brutality against the civilian population of Iraq.’

Elsewhere in Iraq attacks continued as Islamic State jihadists fight to spread their control over large swathes of the country.

Yesterday a suicide attack has left at least five people dead in Erbil, the capital of Iraq’s autonomous Kurdish region.

The attacker tried to drive his vehicle into the governorate building and was cut short by guards’ gunfire.

The attack, which was the first to target the city’s centre in seven months, also left dozens of people wounded.

The suicide bomber - along with three civilians and two police officers - was killed.
