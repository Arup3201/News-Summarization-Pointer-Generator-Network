A powerful music mogul is going to court this week in what has become a long, drawn out divorce case.

Jason Flom split from his wife Wendy in 2010, but they are continuing to fight over what cut she gets of his reported $100million net worth. The two had been married for 20 years.

Mr Flom is the CEO and founder of Lava Records which currently produces Jessie J. Past artists on the record label include Matchbox Twenty, Sugar Ray and Kid Rock.

Messy split: Lava Records CEO Jason Flom, right, goes to court this week as his wife Wendy, left, battles to claim half his fortune in a divorce battle that has taken three years to settle

In the past, he worked for Atlantic, Virgin and Capitol Records where he personally signed Katy Perry.

The soon-to-be ex-Mrs Flom, a former Atlantic Records exec herself, is arguing that she was pivotal in starting Lava Records and wants exactly half of Mr Flom's assets.

A source close to Mrs Flom told the New York Post: 'Wendy insists she was hugely influential in helping Jason's career and wants half of everything. She claims she helped him establish Lava Records in 2009. But Jason does not want to cut the check and pay her the settlement she is demanding. He is saying she had nothing to do with his company. Is she suddenly supposed to enter the workforce again at 50-something?'

And it looks like Mrs Flom will use her husband's quick rebound against him in court.

She claims that her middle-aged husband dated Rachel Uchitel (Tiger Woods' former mistress) after their split and has turned into a bit of a party animal.

But Mr Flom responded saying the rumors were false.

'That is absolutely and categorically not true. I do not touch any drugs of any kind, ever. I have [been an advocate] to decriminalize drugs, but I don't do any drug whatsoever. I don't smoke pot. I don't even take NyQuil,' he said.

Mrs Flom could take the stand today in the divorce trial.Â
