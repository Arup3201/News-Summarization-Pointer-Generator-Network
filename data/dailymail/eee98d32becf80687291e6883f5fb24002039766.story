Mystery: A neighbor of John Sheridan (pictured) and his wife, Joyce, told a 911 dispatcher last month that he heard someone banging on the door inside the couple's home during a fire 

A neighbor reporting the fire that killed the president of a major New Jersey hospital and his wife last month told 911 dispatchers that he heard banging coming from inside the house.

On the tape released by investigators Wednesday to Philadelphia Inquirer, the neighbor can be heard saying that he saw smoke coming from the home of John and Joyce Sheridan and ‘somebody's trying to get out, they're banging on the door.’

Earlier this month, investigators ruled that fire had been intentionally set in a Montgomery Township home where 72-year-old John Sheridan lived with his 69-year-old wife.

Mr Sheridan was president and CEO of Camden-based Cooper University Health Care, which has more than 700 physicians and serves more than half a million patients a year.

Sheridan, a Republican, also had ties to Governor Chris Christie and served as general counsel to the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.

Police and firefighters responded to reports of a fire at the Sheridans’ home on Meadow Run Drive at 6.15am on September 28.

Authorities said the fire was contained to the master bedroom, where firefighters found the unresponsive couple. The husband was pronounced dead at the scene, while his wife, a retired schoolteacher, succumbed to her injuries at a hospital a short time later.

The couple's neighbor, who called 911 that morning after smelling something burning and hearing the sound of a smoke alarm going off, told the dispatcher that when he knocked on the Sheridans' front door, he could hear what he believed to be a person trying to get out of a room upstairs,

Capt. Jack Bennett, a spokesman for the Somerset County Prosecutor's Office, responded to the claims made by the neighbor on the 911 recording by saying that what the man heard were actually the sounds from the raging fire, and not a person banging.

John Sheridan, 79, was pronounced dead on the scene, while his wife, Joyce, 69, succumbed to her injuries a short time later at the hospital

Police and fire investigators have been tight-lipped about the details of the case, declining to divulge anything beyond the fact that the fire was set intentionally, and that there was no threat to public safety.

Law enforcement officials have said they were awaiting additional test results and a report from the medical examiner's office to shed light on the Sheridans' cause of death.

By all accounts, John Sheridan was a well-connected political figure with many powerful friends in the GOP, including four New Jersey governors.

The Sheridans’ joint memorial service in Trenton last week drew hundreds of mourners, among them Chris Christie and four of his predecessors, former governors Jim Florio, Christine Whitman, Tom Kean and Don DiFrancesco.

‘He was one of those public servants in the best sense of the word because he loved the state,’ Whitman told 6ABC, referring to John Sheridan. ‘He was a Republican, but he never served for the Republicans, he served for the people.

Sheridan has been credited with helping revitalize Camden – a hard-scrabble, poverty-ridden city best known for having the highest crime rate in the nation, according to FBI statistics.

Sheridan, who had been a partner in a law firm for many years before taking over the Camden-based health system, served as transportation commissioner under Governor Kean and was part of gubernatorial transition teams for both Whitman and Christie.

Speaking at the couple's memorial in Trenton October 7, Governor Christie said: ‘I can’t imagine the pain and the loss that the Sheridans are feeling right now,’ according to NJ.com.

The couple are survived by four grown children and three grandchildren. Their son Mark Sheridan currently serves as general counsel for the New Jersey Republican State Committee.  

A statement issued by the Cooper University Health System last month said the organization was 'saddened to announce the death' of Sheridan and his wife.

'There is no one else who has had as big an impact on me as John did except my father,' said Cooper Health System board of trustees chairman George E. Norcross III in the statement.

Adrienne Kirby, president and CEO of Cooper University Health, remembered Sheridan for his 'quiet strength, his decisiveness and his passionate belief that Cooper not only could make a difference in people’s lives, it had an obligation to do so.'

Sheridan was praised for getting the first new medical school in three decades built in New Jersey, having helped bring plans for the Cooper Medical School at Rowan University to fruition in 2012.

'Perhaps his greatest contribution to the larger Cooper community was his commitment to helping revitalize Camden,' the statement said. 

'There was never a day that went by when he wasn’t focused on what Cooper could do to help revitalize the city that he loved.'

Camden mayor Dana Redd released a statement of condolences as well.

'They will both be profoundly missed by the entire Camden community,' wrote Redd. 'I have personally known John Sheridan since 2001. We worked closely as Cooper enhanced their campus and during the early planning stages of the Cooper Medical School of Rowan University.'

Sheridan began in law after graduating from Rutgers Law School. He later worked his way up to co-chairman at law firm Riker, Danzig, Riker, where he was also senior partner.

He began at Cooper in 2005 as senior executive vice president, moving up to chief administrative officer and then president in 2007. 

Before Cooper, he served as general counsel to the New Jersey Turnpike authority and sat on the board of trustees at the Carrier Clinic.
