The Australian government has abandoned its five-year pledge to introduce a compulsory filter blocking child pornography and other objectionable internet content.

Instead, internet service providers have agreed to block 1,400 child abuse websites on Interpol's 'worst of' list, said Communications Minister Stephen Conroy.

Three of Australia's largest telecommunications companies - Telstra, Optus and Primus - have been blocking the listed sites anyway since 2010.

Compromise: The Australian government downgraded strict internet restriction proposals to just concentrate on banning child abuse sites

'We've actually reached agreement with the industry to block child pornography and we think that is a significant step forward,' Conroy told Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio.

Critics had argued the proposed compulsory filter would have put Australia in the same censorship league as China and the US State Department had been among those who expressed concerns at the proposed draconian regulations.

The revised plan has a narrower focus on child abuse, as opposed to the original list which also wanted banned sites that carried extreme violence or detailed instructions on crime, drug use or acts of terrorism.

Opponents also argued that the filter would slow internet speeds, erroneously block harmless sites and restrict free speech.

Anti-censorship campaigner Geordie Guy welcomed the government's reversal but claimed it wouldn't have much impact.

'While this is a much better result than any of the previous proposals that the government came up with, it's still really unlikely to do much good,' he told ABC.

The Internet Industry Association of Australia chief executive Peter Lee said he was 'pleased that the government has now moved on' from the filter and has narrowed the focus to just child abuse sites.

However, the Australian Electoral Lobby said the agreement with ISPs fell short of the pledges made during the 2007 election campaign.

'The government's decision not to legislate to the full extent of the commitment is a great disappointment,' the Lobby's managing director Jim Wallace said.

In reality, the government never had a hope of getting the full filter legislation through parliament because The Green party, a key government ally, joined the opposition in condemning the plans as a serious restriction of free speech.
