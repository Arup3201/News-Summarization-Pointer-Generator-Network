A man has been killed in a shark attack while fishing with a group of friends off the south coast of Australia.

The 28-year-old victim was part of a spear-fishing group when he went missing in the water off Goldsmith Beach, which is off the Yorke Peninsula, west of the state capital, Adelaide.

Witnesses told police they saw the victim thrashing about in the water after the shark - believed to be a Great White -Â  had approached.

Police said witnesses were traumatised at watching the tragedy unfold. Sergeant Mark Stuart said: 'Some of them did witness it. From what we can gather they were an 
experienced group of fisherman and they were on the peninsula to 
participate in a spearfishing competition tomorrow.

'There wasn't a competition today but they were planning to do that somewhere tomorrow.

'They were diving loosely in a group, probably within a few hundred metres of each other."

Locals said the great white had been in the area for about a week, having been attracted by an abundance of snapper fish.

The attack comes as the Western Australian Government fends off criticism of a shark culling program it introduced last month to protect swimmers.

The policy allows for great white, tiger, and bull sharks larger than 3 metres to be killed, while smaller sharks are to be released.

Opponents of the policy say there is no scientific evidence that killing the sharks will reduce their threat to swimmers.
