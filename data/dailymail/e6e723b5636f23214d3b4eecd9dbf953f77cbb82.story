Protetsors have clashed with riot police in the Philippines during a visit by Barack Obama over a defence deal that would give U.S. troops greater access to the country's military bases.

Activists burned mock U.S. flags while chanting 'Nobama, no bases, no war' outside the presidential palace in the capital, Manila, where the President was meeting his counterpart Benigno Aquino.

Around 800 people violently reacted to the 10-year pact signed between Washington and Manila that they believe is a step back to when it was an American colony before the Second World War.

Stand off: Activists clashed with riot police in the Filipino capital, Manila, over a defence deal

Burn: Protestors outside the Presidential Palace, where Barack Obama met his counterpart Benigno Aquino, use the end of the newspaper to set a US flag alight

Filipinos ripped up barbed wire and used placards to defend themselves as officers fired water cannons in an effort to disperse them.

The crowd believe the defence deal, which was signed days before Obama touched down in Philippines, reverses democratic gains achieved when US bases were shut down in the early 1990s.

The former colony, which gained independence in 1946, had a US military presence for more than 100 years.

The violent clashes came on the last day of the US President's tour which saw him visit Japan, South Korea and Malaysia.

Obama claimed the 
arrangement will help promote peace and stability in a region unsettled 
by China's claims on disputed territories.

Confrontation: Hundreds managed to get close to the police line as officers desperately tried to force them back with shields

The angry protests came after a 10-year deal between Washington and Manila, allowing US troops greater access to Filipino bases

The Philippine Senate voted in 1991 to close down U.S. bases at Subic and Clark, northwest of Manila.

However, it ratified a pact with the United States allowing temporary visits by American forces in 1999, four years after China seized a reef the Philippines contests.

Following 9/11, hundreds of U.S. forces descended in the southern Philippines under that accord to hold counter terrorism exercises with Filipino troops fighting Muslim militants.

Hundreds of American military personnel have been deployed in the southern Philippines since 2002 to provide counterterrorism training and serve as advisers to Filipino soldiers, who have battled Muslim militants for decades.

The new agreement, called The Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, will give American forces temporary access to selected military camps and allow them to preposition fighter jets and ships.

The controversial agreement was also 
agreed during a territorial dispute between Manila and Beijing over 
islands in a large swathe of the South China Sea, heightening tensions 
in the region.

Before getting on Air Force One for 
the flight to Washington to end his tout of Asia, Obama rallied U.S. and Philippine troops at 
Fort Bonifacio, just outside Manila.

Inside a sweltering gymnasium, Obama hailed the 
cooperation both sides showed during some of the storied battles of  
the Second World War.

He also 
paid his respects at the Manila American Cemetery, where row upon row of
 white crosses mark the final resting places of more than 17,000 
military personnel from that war, including nearly 600 
Filipinos.

Obama vigorously defended his foreign 
policy record Monday, arguing that his cautious approach to global 
problems has avoided the type of missteps that contributed to a 
'disastrous' decade of war for the United States.

Questions
 over the situation in Russia overshadowed an Obama tour that was meant 
to reassure anxious allies in the orbit of a rising China that the U.S. 
will always be there to defend them.

Departure: The violent clashes came on the last day of President Obama's tour of Asia

Return: He turned his back on the visit after vigorously defending his foreign policy, but situation in Russia overshadowed the trip
