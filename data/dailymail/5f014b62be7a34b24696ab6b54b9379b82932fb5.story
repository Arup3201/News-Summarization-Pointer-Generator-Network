A 14-year-old girl was killed from fumes by a barbecue her parents placed inside her tent to keep her warm during a family camping trip, an inquest heard today.

Hannah Thomas-Jones died from the 'silent killer' of carbon monoxide after sleeping next to the fire, while the other members of her family were hospitalised after their exposure to the gas.

Her parents wept as they told the hearing how they had taken pains to minimise the risk of a fire, but were unaware of the dangers posed by carbon monoxide.

Tragedy: Hannah Thomas-Jones died of carbon monoxide poisoning in May last year

Hannah, from Handforth in Cheshire, was pronounced dead by paramedics after they were called to a campsite in Bucknell, Shropshire in May last year.

Her brother, mother and stepfather were treated in hospital for the effects of carbon monoxide, but the 14-year-old was the member of the family who was closest to the bucket-type barbecue which produced the fumes.

Hannah's mother, Danielle Jones, frequently wiped away tears as she told the inquest in Wem, Shropshire how paramedics informed her that her daughter could not be revived on.

Mrs Jones, who paid tribute to Hannah as a 'beautiful and wonderful' person, said several members of her family were staying at the Baron of Beef campsite, where they watched the FA Cup Final in a pub.

After the football match had finished, the family had used the blue Tesco barbecue, which had three metal legs, to keep warm underneath a gazebo.

But after Hannah went to bed, the barbecue was moved into the porch of the tent she was sleeping in.

Mrs Jones, who said it was a cold night, told the coroner: 'We decided to take the barbecue into the porch area of the tent.

'We made sure that effectively it was fire-proof - that if anything fell out it wouldn't catch fire.

'Obviously, we didn't understand the dangers of the carbon monoxide.'

When she awoke the next morning, Mrs Jones' arms and legs felt sore and she could not talk.

'Then I remember a lot of shouting - I remember both the sides of the tent being opened,' she said. 'I just couldn't do anything, I couldn't breathe.'

Her husband, Philip Jones, told the coroner the barbecue had 'gone down' by the time it was placed in the tent, and was 'like hot bricks giving off heat'.

Shaun Baker, of Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service, recreated the effects of the barbecue during a detailed investigation of the incident.

The fire officer said efforts had been made to highlight the dangers posed by carbon monoxide from barbecues in the wake of several deaths in similar circumstances.

Mr Baker told the court many people did not realise that 'incomplete combustion' after flames had died down could result in the emission of carbon monoxide, which is odourless.

Warning: Officials used the case to alert the public to the danger of carbon monoxide poisoning

Early symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning - including headaches or dizziness - can mimic many common ailments, and may easily be confused with food poisoning, viral infections, flu or simply tiredness.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, coroner John Ellery told members of Hannah's family: 'It's quite clear that you and many, many people were unaware of the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.

'The risk you were addressing when you brought that barbecue in, in its dying embers, was against fire.

'That was a risk you acted against, but sadly what was happening was that carbon monoxide was coming from those embers.

'I accept that those vapours went to the top of the tent and probably found their way down to the far end, where tragically Hannah's head was.'

Mr Ellery said he hoped the case would help educate the public about the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning.
