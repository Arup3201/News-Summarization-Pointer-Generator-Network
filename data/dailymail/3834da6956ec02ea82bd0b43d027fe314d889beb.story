A suicide bombing tore through a mosque in the Syrian capital today, killing a top Sunni Muslim preacher and long-time supporter of President Bashar Assad along with at least 40 other people.

The assassination of Sheikh Mohammad Said Ramadan al-Buti removes one of the few remaining pillars of support for the Alawite leader among the majority sect that has risen up against him.

The powerful explosion struck as al-Buti, an 84-year-old cleric and religious scholar who appeared often on TV, was giving a religious lesson in the Eman Mosque in the central Mazraa district of Damascus, according to state TV.

Suicide bombings blamed on Islamic extremists fighting with the rebels have become common in Syria's two-year-old civil war.

But today's explosion marked the first time a suicide bomber detonated his explosives inside a mosque.

Syrian TV footage showed wounded people and bodies with severed limbs on the blood-stained floor and later, bodies covered in white body bags lined up in rows. Sirens wailed through the capital as ambulances rushed to the scene of the explosion, which was sealed off by the military.

Al-Buti's death was a blow to Syria's embattled leader, who is fighting mainly Sunni rebels seeking his removal.

Al-Buti has been a vocal supporter of his regime since the early days of Assad's father and predecessor, the late President Hafez Assad.

Sunnis are the majority sect in Syria while Assad is from the minority Alawite sect - an offshoot of Shiite Islam.

He was the regular preacher of the 
eighth century Omayyad Mosque, but Syrian TV said he was giving a 
religious sermon to students at Eman Mosque when the explosion occurred.

In
recent months, Syrian TV has carried his sermon from mosques in 
Damascus live every week. He also has a regular religious TV programme.

Syrian
TV began its evening newscast with a phone announcement from the 
religious endowments minister, Mohammad Abdelsattar al-Sayyed, declaring
al-Buti's 'martyrdom' as his voice choked up. It then showed parts of 
his sermon last Friday in which he praised the military for battling the
'mercenaries' and said Syria was being subjected to a 'universal 
conspiracy'.

Assad's regime
refers to the rebels fighting against it as 'terrorists' and 
'mercenaries' who are backed by foreign powers trying to destabilise the
country.

The war, which the UN says has killed 
more than 70,000 people, has become increasingly chaotic as rebels press
closer to Assad's seat of power in Damascus after seizing large swathes
of territory in the northern and eastern parts of the country.

The rebels also captured a village and
other territory on the edge of the Golan Heights today as fighting 
closed in on the strategic plateau that Israel captured from Syria in 
1967 and later annexed, activists and officials said.

The
battles near the town of Quneitra in south-west Syria sent many 
residents fleeing, including dozens who crossed into neighbouring 
Lebanon. The fighting in the sensitive area began yesterday near the 
ceasefire line between Syrian and Israeli troops.

One of the worst-case scenarios for Syria's civil war is that it could draw in neighbouring countries such as Israel or Lebanon.

The Britain-based activist group 
Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said rebels seized control of parts 
of villages a few miles from the cease-fire line with Israel after 
fierce fighting with regime forces.

The
Local Coordination Committees, another anti-regime activist group, 
reported heavy fighting in the nearby village of Sahm al-Golan and said 
rebels are attacking an army post.

Syrian State television blamed the death of Sheikh Mohamed Said al-Bouti on 'terrorist gangs', a term used by the regime of President Bashar al-Assad to refer to rebels fighting for his overthrow

The Observatory said seven people, including three children, were killed yesterday by government shelling of villages in the area.

Rami Abdul-Rahman, who heads the Observatory, said the fighting around the town of Arnabeh intensified today, a day after rebels captured it. He added that the rebels captured two nearby army posts.

In Lebanon, security officials said 150 people, mostly women and children, walked for six hours in rugged mountains covered with snow to reach safety in the Lebanese border town of Chebaa.

The Yarmouk Martyrs Brigade, a rebel group active in southern Syria, said in a statement on its Facebook page that its fighters stormed an army post between the villages of Sahm al-Golan and Shajara.

Activists on Facebook pages affiliated with rebels in Quneitra announced the start of the operation to 'break the siege on Quneitra and Damascus' western suburbs.'

The fighting moved closer to Israel as President Barack Obama was visiting the country for the first time since taking office more than four years ago.
