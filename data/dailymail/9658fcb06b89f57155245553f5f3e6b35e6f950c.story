A father was stabbed to death with an axe following a row with a gang of teenagers outside his home, reports today suggest.

Paul Thrower, 46, was attacked by a gang who were allegedly smoking drugs and drinking alcohol outside a block of flats in St Dunstan’s Close, Hayes, west London.

After Mr Thrower confronted the group, one - who was reportedly holding an axe - attacked him.

Paul Thrower was killed following a row with a gang of teens who were smoking drugs and drinking alcohol outside his home, reports today suggest

Mr Thrower's brother Darren described how one of the gang attacked the handyman with an axe as he turned away from the group. One 16-year-old has been arrested and remains in custody

The group of five were then seen running 
from the scene shortly after the ‘blazing row’, neighbours said today.

The handyman died in hospital shortly before 11.30 on Thursday evening.

A 16-year-old youth has been arrested and is in custody in a West London police station.

Yesterday, Mr Thrower's brother described what happened between his sibling and the gang.

Speaking with The Sun, Darren Thrower said: 'He chased them upstairs. They were behind a closed door and my brother was trying to get through. Then his girlfriend said "They've got a knife. Come away Paul." As my brother turned away the axe came down and got him in the back.'

One neighbour, who did not want to 
give her name, said: 'I saw Paul getting CPR just outside the flat. It 
was dark but I could see him getting chest compressions.

A block of flats in Hayes, west London, where the attack took place. Crime scene investigators were at the location throughout Friday

Officers scan for clues in homes located near to St Dunstan's close. Neighbours today said Mr Thrower's death was a huge loss to their community

'Ambulance
 crews and police had been in the flat for a while before that, so I 
knew it didn’t look good. It was awful to see, he was a good man, he 
didn’t deserve that.

'I think his son Luke was coming down to visit him at the weekend. It’s so sad.

Mr Thrower was attacked late on Thursday evening. He was taken to hospital but died shortly before midnight, police confirmed

'There
 can be as many a 30 youths hanging around the flats on a night time. 
They just hang around smoking and drinking. There used to be a lot of 
drug deals going on around and there was a curfew, but they just ignore 
it.'

One man, who didn’t want to be named, said drugs were 'rife' on the estate.

He
 said: 'There are so many drugs down there it’s rife. Sooner or later 
someone is going to take the law into their own hands and do something 
about the problem. The police don’t do anything about it.

'But
 because they are so young there is not a lot they can do unless they 
catch them with something. There is a dispersal order to stop them 
gathering, but it doesn’t seem to work.'

Another neighbour, Ashmat Nasrat, 25, said the gangs are not from the estate.

He
 said: 'They don’t even live here most of them. They just hang around 
outside the shops. This block and St Dunstans are the only ones they can
 get into so they swarm on us. Someone was arrested with a knife not 
long ago.'

Oyin Damola, who lives in St Dunstan’s Close said: 'There’s tape that’s been up up and there are a lot of police standing around. The pathways around the crime scene have been closed off.'

She added that police have in the past been called to disperse large groups of youths that 'intimidate' older residents.

'I have just seen youths in groups hanging around in front of the school in the past. I don’t know what they’re doing.

'The police are usually around and they try to scatter them. I do think it’s threatening. We have a lot of old people living around here and they must get intimidated sometimes.

'It’s a bit scary at night. This is the first incident I’ve heard of though,' she added.

Neighbours said Mr Thrower had a son called Luke who was due to visit the 46-year-old this weekend

It is thought that the stabbing happened close to Cranford Park Academy.

Minutes of a PTA meeting in October last year reported: 'Local
 Police have issued a Police Dispersal Notice as a result of gangs of 
young people gathering in the area. Police are very aware of the problem
 and are working with the community to stamp out anti-social behaviour.

'Parents
 will be given the notice this evening, with a number to contact if 
anyone feels intimidated by the presence of these gangs.

Irene Riddell, 83, whose house backs onto St Dunstans Close, said her daughter heard a commotion.

The building where the attack took place. One neighbour described the area as 'scary' yesterday

A row of officers scan the grass for potential clues following the attack on Thursday evening

She said: 'She told me she heard a blazing row going on out the back. The dog started barking.

'The
 men were shouting and swearing at each other she said. Then she saw 
five men in hoods ran away towards the the maisonettes down the road.'

Another neighbour, Harry Bishop said today Mr Thrower was a 'popular man'.

The
 18 year old said: 'Everyone really liked him around here. He was a 
really nice man. People used to take the mick out of him, but it was 
just banter. I don’t know who could have done this. We’re all in shock.

Another neighbour Suman Sami, said his death was a great loss to the community.

She
 said: 'He was such a nice man. He would clean everybody’s windows 
around here. He was very much a handy man. He fixed my roof a couple of 
years ago. It’s such a shame.'

A Scotland Yard Spokesperson said: 'A murder investigation has been launched in Hayes following the death of a 46-year old man.

'Police were called to a block of flats in St Dunstans Close, Hayes, shortly before 21.35hrs on Thursday, 20 February, following reports of a disturbance.

'On arrival officers found a man, aged 46ys, suffering stab wounds to the torso.

'London Ambulance Service and London’s Air Ambulance attended the scene and the man was taken to a central London hospital where he was pronounced dead at 23.34hrs.'

Police forensics are on the scene searching for clues, while officers have been scouring nearby roof tops looking for evidence.
