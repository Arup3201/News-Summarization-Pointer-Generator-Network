The National Security Agency has monitored the phone conversations of at least 35 world leaders after being given their numbers by an official in another government department, according to a classified document leaked by whistle-blower Edward Snowden.

The confidential memo reveals that senior officials in 'customer' departments such the White House and the Pentagon were encouraged to share their ‘Rolodexes’ of contact details with the NSA.

The agency then added the phone numbers of the foreign politicians to their surveillance systems and started to monitor them.

The NSA has monitored the phone conversations of at least 35 world leaders according to the latest leak of classified government information to emerge from Edward Snowden

According to the leaked document handed over to The Guardian, one unnamed official handed over 200 numbers - including those of at least 35 world leaders - none of whom were named.

The revelation comes amid mounting diplomatic tensions between the US and its allies, after the German chancellor Angela Merkel accused the American government on Wednesday of tapping her mobile phone.

The White House has denied that it is currently listening in on Merkel's phone calls.

Spokesman 
Jay Carney said on Wednesday that 'the United States is not monitoring and will not 
monitor the communications of the chancellor.'

GSM base stations, for example, make it possible to monitor mobile phones, such as that of German Chancellor Angela Merkel

But German newspaper Der Spiegel noted that the White House 
spokesperson 'did not wish to specify' whether the U.S. denied 
monitoring Merkel's communications in the past.

European leaders united in anger Thursday as they attended a summit overshadowed by reports of widespread U.S. spying on its allies.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the allegations had shattered trust in the Obama administration and undermined the crucial trans-Atlantic relationship.

Merkel's unusually stern remarks as she arrived at the European Union gathering indicated she wasn't placated by a phone conversation she had Wednesday with President Barack Obama, or his personal assurances that the U.S. is not listening in on her calls now.

'We need trust among allies and partners,' Merkel told reporters in Brussels. 'Such trust now has to be built anew. This is what we have to think about.'

'The United States of America and Europe face common challenges. We are allies,' the German leader said. 'But such an alliance can only be built on trust. That's why I repeat again: spying among friends, that cannot be.'

Controversy: The National Security Agency (NSA) headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland has been at the centre of a developing diplomatic row since Edward Snowden leaked documents

This
 latest leak lends weight to claims that surveillance of national 
leaders - even allies - is not only routine practise but that the NSA 
isn’t shy about asking other US officials for their help.

The memo dates from October 2006 and so was written halfway through George W Bush's second term.

It
 was issued to staff in the agency's Signals Intelligence Directorate 
(SID) and was titled ‘Customers Can Help SID Obtain Targetable Phone 
Numbers’.

Officials who mixed with world leaders and politicians were encouraged to provide information that could help with surveillance.

‘In
 one recent case,’ the memo noted, ‘a US official provided NSA with 200 
phone numbers to 35 world leaders … Despite the fact that the majority 
is probably available via open source, the PCs [intelligence production 
centers] have noted 43 previously unknown phone numbers. These numbers 
plus several others have been tasked.’

The White House has denied the claims that U.S. intelligence has been listening in on Merkel's phone (Obama pictured this week)

The
 document explained that the new phone numbers had helped the agency 
discover more new contact details to add to their monitoring, but 
acknowledged that eavesdropping on the numbers had produced ‘little 
reportable intelligence.’

The memo then asks analysts to think about useful contact details that they might be able to provide.

‘This
 success leads S2 [signals intelligence] to wonder if there are NSA 
liaisons whose supported customers may be willing to share their 
'Rolodexes' or phone lists with NSA as potential sources of 
intelligence," it states. "S2 welcomes such information!"

On
 Thursday Carney told reporters: 'The [NSA] revelations have clearly 
caused tension in our relationships with some countries, and we are 
dealing with that through diplomatic channels.

'These
 are very important relations both economically and for our security, 
and we will work to maintain the closest possible ties.'
