Brave: Abdulrahman's story is not one of broken dreams and despair, but of extraordinary courage and brotherly love, wrought from the horror of war

Like most 11-year-old boys, Abdulrahman dreamed of being a professional footballer.

But that dream has been shattered, replaced by nightmares of the moment he was almost killed by a rocket attack near his home in Syria.

The schoolboy's left leg was so badly damaged in the blast that medics were forced to amputate it in a makeshift field hospital in the basement of a nearby mosque.

However, Abdulrahman's story is not one of broken dreams and despair, but of extraordinary courage and brotherly love, wrought from the horror of Syria's bloody civil war.

Unable to walk, he was rescued from 
the violence that has gripped his homeland for almost two years by his 
21-year-old brother, Omar, who literally carried Abdulrahman on his back across the border to Turkey.

The devoted pair now await 
humanitarian visas to take them to America where Omar found a charity 
that helps child victims of war.

But despite this promise of hope, Abdulrahman is still haunted by the day his life changed forever.

He told CNN's Arwa Damon: 'There were fighter planes and there was a rocket that hit next to our house. I went to see what was going on and then another rocket hit.'

Comforting the youngster in their temporary accommodation in Ankara, Omar said in near flawless English: 'Mum woke me up and said "stand up immediately".

'She said Abdulrahman had gone out and the aeroplane was roaming above and you need to get him back to the house.'

A brother's love: His 21-year-old brother, Omar, literally carried Abdulrahman on his back across the border to Turkey to escape the horrors of war

But he arrived too late. Abdulrahman had already been taken to hospital - where Omar immediately went.

'Once he saw me he shouted "Omar" with
all his strength, he said, fighting back tears. 'When I got closer I 
saw his leg and I just yelled and I started crying for around five 
hours.

'After he woke up I was still crying and he said to me, "please don't cry. If you love me, don't cry".'

He then promised Omar he would walk again.

Courage: Abdulrahman makes a 'V' sign from his hospital bed in the makeshift hospital

Pain: Omar cannot relive his brother's ordeal without crying. The first thing Abdulrahman said to Omar from his hospital bed was 'please don't cry. If you love me, don't cry'

Omar continued: 'He kept saying to me, "when are we leaving?" Every time he heard planes overhead he said "we have to leave".'

Omar cares for his brother night and 
day and has become an expert in changing his bandages. He started saving
for a prosthetic leg but realised that would take too much time.

After some investigation, Egyptian 
doctors told Omar about the Global Medical Relief Fund - a small charity
that provides help to children who have been badly injured in disasters
and warzones.

Inseparable: With arms aching under the weight of his brother and the three bags full of all their belongings, Omar staggered into Turkey after a taxi driver dropped them off with the words, 'You're on your own'

Help at last: After some investigation, Egyptian doctors told Omar about the Global Medical Relief Fund - a small American charity that provides help to children who have been badly injured in disasters and warzones

In order to get the help Abdulrahman so desperately needed, the brothers had to leave their family in Syria and head for Turkey.

They found a taxi driver that would 
take them to within a few miles of the border before the driver dropped 
them off, telling them: 'You're on your own now.'

Determined to get his brother to a safe place where he could get help, Omar carried Abdulrahman on his back through the fields of Syria's lawless frontier towards the border.

'He is not a child anymore': Omar says the ordeal has forced Abdulrahman to grow up in his mind

Waiting: They now face a nervous wait to find out if the U.S. State Department will issue them with humanitarian visa to enter the country.

But without passports, they cannot fly to the U.S.. They now face a nervous wait to find out if the U.S. State Department will issue them with humanitarian visa to enter the country.

Omar added: 'He had nightmares and day dreams, sometimes bad ones. I think the most important thing he is learning is how to grow up in his mind. He is not a child anymore.'

Violence continued: Buildings destroyed by the shelling of Syrian forces at al-Qossour neighborhood in Homs province, central Syria

Still fighting: A Syrian rebel takes cover as he fires at enemy positions in the Karmal Jabl neighborhood, during clashes between rebel fighters and the Syrian army in Aleppo, Syria

Devastation: A crowd gathers in front of a building damaged after a car bomb in Jaramana district, near Damascus on October 29
