The investigation into World Cup bidding has seen a number of individuals having ethics cases opened against them, it has been announced.

The action has been taken by FIFA ethics investigator Michael Garcia, and was announced in a joint statement with ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert following a meeting of the pair at FIFA headquarters in Zurich.

It is not known how many people have had cases opened against them, or for what specific reasons. FIFA has also lodged a separate criminal complaint with the Swiss attorney general.

The statement also said Garcia's full report into his investigation into bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups would be passed to Domenico Scala, the chairman of FIFA's audit and compliance committee, who determine how much of the information should be made available to FIFA's executive committee.

The statement read: 'The investigatory chamber has already opened a number of formal cases against individuals as a result of that inquiry.

'Neither the recent referral of the reports to the Swiss Federal Public Prosecutor's Office nor the request to the chairman of the FIFA Audit and Compliance Committee will interfere with those ongoing proceedings.'

The statement was released a few hours after it was claimed a FIFA executive committee member had been reported to the ethics committee after asking for 'hard cash' in return for votes during bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups - but no action was ever taken.

Les Murray, an Australian who was on the FIFA ethics committee at the time, reported the demand after being informed of it by people working for the Australia 2022 bid.

Sources with knowledge of the cash-for-votes demand said the FIFA Ex Co member asked for $5million (£3.19m) to build a sports centre.

Murray has now questioned why his report of the incident was not mentioned in ethics judge Eckert's findings.

Murray wrote on his blog on the website of Australia broadcaster SBS: 'Three years ago, when I was still on the FIFA ethics committee, I was informed by sources inside the Australian bid team that a member of the FIFA executive committee was asking the Australians for hard cash in return for votes.

'I reported this information up the chain of the ethics committee at the time, as was my duty, but I see no mention of it in Eckert's report.'

Eckert last week cleared Russia and Qatar to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups saying rule breaches by the bidding countries were 'of very limited scope'

Garcia responded by notifying FIFA that he intends to lodge an appeal against the decision due to 'numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of the facts'. 

FIFA acknowledged the joint statement from the ethics committee chairmen.

A FIFA statement said: 'We understand that the chairman of the Audit and Compliance Committee, who is also independent, will evaluate the matter and decide on any next steps.'

Whistleblower Phaedra Almajid claimed she received threats against her and her children

Another whistleblower, Phaedra Almajid, who worked for the Qatar 2022 bid team before losing her job in 2010, claims she will live the rest of her life in fear after receiving threats against her and her children. 

She provided evidence of wrongdoing to Garcia's independent inquiry into the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids.

Her evidence was given on condition of anonymity - a condition she believes was deliberately breached in a summary of Garcia's report published by FIFA ethics committee judge  Eckert last week.

'Do I regret being the Qatar whistleblower? It has cost me personally, it has cost me emotionally - I know for a fact I will be looking over my shoulder for the rest of my life,' Almajid told Sky Sports News.

'It has cost me my credibility and most importantly it has cost me the security of both me and my children.

'However I did witness something and I believe I did have to say what I had witnessed.'
