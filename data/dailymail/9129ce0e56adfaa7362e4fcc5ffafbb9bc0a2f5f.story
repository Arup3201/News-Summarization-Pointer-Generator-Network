The mother of nine who rakes in benefits of £33,500 a year today defended her family’s £7,000 taxpayer-funded holiday, saying she is already planning another one for next year.

Cheryl Prudham, 32, and husband Rob, 29, who are expecting twin girls in September, were pictured last month in shorts and flip-flops soaking up the sun on a break with their brood in Menorca, Spain.

They stayed at the three-star Hotel Victoria Playa in Santo Tomas, which has two swimming pools and a beach nearby, and Mrs Prudham claimed she was not concerned about using taxpayers’ money.

Cheryl Prudham, 32, defended her use of taxpayers' cash for her holiday with children George, 14, Jack, 13, Caitlin, nine, Maisie, eight, Millie, six, Madison, five, Leon, three, Lenny, two, and Lainey, one

The mother, who lives in a five-bedroom council house with her family in Gravesend, Kent, told Closer magazine: ‘I don’t feel bad about using taxpayers’ money. We’re entitled to a holiday.

‘We spent our days going for walks on the beach, having toasties by the pool and watching the hotel entertainment in the evenings. One of our rooms had a sea view.’

Mrs Prudham, who has admitted smoking during pregnancy and taking her children out of school in term time, is expecting twin girls in September, and will get a further £1,400 a year in child benefit.

She added: ‘I asked the school headmaster if we could get time off, but he said "no". So we decided to go anyway. One of the weeks was during half term, so they haven’t missed that much school.

‘We didn’t want to wait until the summer as it’s too hot to go away then. If we get fined we’ll have to deal with it. We’d pay it off gradually - there’s no way we could afford a big lump sum.’

‘I haven’t put a limit on how many more children I’ll have. People criticise me for getting lots of benefits but it’s the Government’s fault. You’re not going to say no to money if it’s offered to you.’

The couple said that they 
had been enjoying quality time with children George, 14, Jack, 13, Caitlin, 
nine, Maisie, eight, Millie, six, Madison, five, Leon, three, Lenny, 
two, and Lainey, one.

Mr 
Prudham told MailOnline last month: ‘We’re having a great time. I’d like 
to buy a villa out here. The kids deserved a holiday – it’s nice for 
them – and we just want to spend time with them.’

Mr
 Prudham also said of critics of their lifestyle: ‘I’m not bothered what
 other people think. They’re just stuck up. People are just jealous.

'It’s
 none of anybody else’s business. Other people like us go on holiday all
 the time and it doesn’t matter if it is in England or abroad, it all 
costs the same'.

The couple 
could be fined more than £800 after taking their children on holiday 
during term time. ‘I’m not worried about the school fines. It is up to 
us when we go on holiday’, Mr Prudham said.

Mrs
 Prudham, who posted a selfie with her husband on Facebook while on 
holiday, was also seen smoking while her children were splashing in the 
pool. When asked how she could justify a fortnight abroad, she told The Sun last month: 'We can't even enjoy a family holiday'.

Abroad: The also admitted headteachers had warned them not to go on holiday in term time, but they went anyway, which means they face fines of £60 per child - a total of £840

And commenting on smoking while pregnant, she added: 'I'm not drinking though, am I? I asked my midwife and she said to me it would be worse if I give up because I would get too stressed out. So I've cut down'.

TaxPayers' Alliance spokesman Andy Silvester said: 'Taxpayers won't be convinced that chipping in for a sunny Spanish holiday is the best way for their money to be used.’

In April, part-time carer Mrs Prudham said her twins would be her last, and that she planned to be sterilised so she could focus on her career.

Mrs Prudham said: ‘For one, I work more hours than what they are saying and two, I'm going to be sterilised. I'm going to have a caesarean and I'm going to get sterilised at the same time.

‘I'm glad that I am pregnant with twins and I am amazed by it. It’s not anybody else's business. I do a job that most people couldn't do. I care for the elderly every single day.’

Home life: This is the Prudams' council house in Gravesend, Kent, but they want to move again because they do not like the area

Mrs Prudham added: ‘I don't give a s*** if people are on my side or not. I don't care.

‘It is actually no one else's business 
about what I choose to do in life. It doesn't matter what you say people
 are still going to judge you. They are still going to bad mouth you.

‘I don't care what people think, it is my choice that 11 children are going to be more than enough. Obviously I want to carry on my career and things like that.’

The parents have been involved in a long-running battle over their council house, because they said they needed a bigger one for all their family.

They used to live in a tiny home in Sittingbourne, Kent, and first demanded a new home last year after hearing about other families on benefits who had landed huge properties.

They repeatedly bid for new council 
homes through Kent Homechoice, which works alongside Kent County 
Council. However, they were left furious when they were turned down by 
the authority.

Instead they agreed a house swap with a family living in Gravesend, who wanted to downsize.

But Mrs Prudham said previously she is unhappy with the new £200,000 home - because they do not like the neighbourhood.

She
added: ‘We've been here for about three months but I'm not really happy
with the new house. We've got enough room but it's just we had to move 
out of Sittingbourne and we liked it there.

‘But
there was nothing available there so I had to do a mutual exchange here
and I don't really like it here to be honest. I'm not going to be able 
to go back to Sittingbourne.’
