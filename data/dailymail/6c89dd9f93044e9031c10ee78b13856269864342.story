it is Britain's biggest annual family holiday and involves more than 100 relatives gathering together from all over the world.

But the yearly Gigg family reunion is now under threat because air fares are too high.

The Giggs have gathered every year the Devon camp site of Westward Ho! for 45 years to continue a tradition started in 1969 by patriarch George Gigg, who died in 2009.

Together again: The Gigg family travels from far and wide to spend every summer together and has done since the tradition was started in 1969

More than 100 of them, including partners of family members, made the annual pilgrimage this week for their holiday at the north Devon resort but they said it could be the last of its kind.

Eighty five of Mr Gigg’s direct descendants are there including five of his children, 27 grandchildren, 50 great grandchildren and three great, great grandchildren.

Family members have travelled from England, France, America, Mozambique, Dubai and Thailand to gather at Braddicks holiday centre.

Now and then: The family gathering was started by patriarch George Gigg, who died in 1009, and has grown every year as the family expanded

But Mr Gigg’s granddaughter Christine Greenfield, 60, from Tunbridge Wells said in future the gatherings could drastically shrink.

She said: 'A lot of them may not make it in future because air fares are expensive.

'Especially those who live in America,' she added. 'They may not come again.'

Man with a plan: George Gigg started the annual family trip in 1969 but sadly passed away in 2009

Mrs Greenfield explained: 'We’ve been gathering for 45 years since 1969.

'It started as a way for Granddad to see his extended family - and it just grew.

'Now it’s become a chance to catch up and keep in touch with everybody.'

She added that like most families there were occasional tiffs but mostly things were very harmonious.

Sunshine break: The Devon camp site has been welcoming the growing family for nearly half a century, but there are fears that high air fares could prevent future meet-ups

'We all get along with each other,' she said.

'There’s no obligation to go at all.

'But generally everybody enjoys it.

'The younger children love playing with each other - they see their cousins of course.

'It’s like one long party for them.'

The tradition of a family get together began 45 years ago when George Gigg’s daughters got together to find a suitable holiday camp to accommodate the family and it has continued ever since.

Speaking in 2004 Mr Gigg’s son-in-law Peter Greenfiled explained: 'My wife and her sister found the holiday camp way back in 1969, when their mother, Stella, was terminally ill and they were looking for a place where she could be visited by her relatives, and it just went on from there.

'There are quite long gaps during a year when we don’t see some members of the family, and this is one occasion when we can get together and spend some quality time with each other.

'We have to book a year in advance and usually take the first week of the school summer holidays,' he said.
