Spotify is making its music available to users regardless of device as part of a new feature called Spotify Connect.

The feature will see Spotify built into audio devices from a range of manufacturers, enabling you to access your listening sessions on different systems through the cloud.

If you’ve been listening to music on your phone during your commute home, for instance, you can pick up where you left of by hitting play on your living room speakers when you get home.

You can then pick up your tablet to keep controlling the music from your sofa, or switch the sound to your iPod Touch in the kitchen’s docking station.

According to the company, this eliminates the need to rely on unstable connections to stream music between your devices.

The group also claims that using Spotify Connect won’t drain your battery and you can continue to use your phone or tablet to call friends or start playing games.

The move is part of an effort to 
increase the number of people signing up for its $9.99 Premium Spotify 
subscription, which is required to use the Spotify Connect service.

The group currently has over 6 million paying subscribers and over 24 million active users.

 ‘Today, listening to music at home can be a frustrating experience – dropouts, below-par audio quality, signal range and phone restrictions, battery drainage, it’s basically a hassle,’ said Sten Garmark, vice president of product management at Spotify.

‘Spotify Connect solves this by giving you effortless control of your music across your phone, tablet and now speakers with millions of songs built right in.’

Spotify Connect will roll out to Spotify Premium subscribers on iPhone, iPad and home audio systems over the coming months, with Android and desktop updates to follow. 

The 10 manufacturers are so far confirmed to adopt Spotify Connect are Argon, Bang & Olufsen, Denon, Hama, Marantz, Philips, Pioneer, Revo, Teufel and Yamaha, with more to follow according to Spotify's global head of hardware partnerships, Pascal de Mul.

The announcement follows Google’s move to stream music and other media from mobile devices in the living room using its Chromecast dongle and Google Cast feature.

All eyes will now be on Apple to see if it will compete with Google and Spotify to offer a subscription-based music service of its own in the UK.  

Last month, Google launched its music streaming service in Britain to do battle with the likes of Spotify.

The internet giant brought Google Play Music All Access to the UK after introducing the monthly subscription service in the U.S. in May.

It is the latest company to enter the crowded music streaming market and will offer its service for £9.99 a month, like many of its competitors.

However, in a bid to undercut rivals, it will charge £7.99 if customers sign up before 15 September and has offered the service free for the first month.

Google has also unveiled a new streaming video gadget which will give users easier access to Internet content on their televisions.

The new device, called Chromecast, is a small stick roughly the same size as a USB flash-storage drive that can be plugged directly into an HDMI port on flat-panel TVs.

It syncs with users' smartphones, tablets and personal computers to bring Netflix, YouTube and other Internet content to what is usually the home TV screens.
