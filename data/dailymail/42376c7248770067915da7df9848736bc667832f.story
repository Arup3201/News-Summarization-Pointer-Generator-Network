A ten year-old boy with one of the rarest disorders in the UK is surviving - thanks to a diet of Lucozade.

Archie Koncher is one of just three people in the country with Propionic Aciduria which means his body converts protein into lethal toxins which damage his vital organs.

He is limited to just 25g of protein a day - equivalent to a pint of milk - and any more than that could kill him.

The genetic disorder is incurable but brave Archie is beating it by drinking up to four bottles of Lucozade a day, which gives him the energy he cannot get from food.

His daily intake of the drink contains a whopping 33 teaspoons of sugar - and costs his parents £120 every month.

His father Dave, 45, an auctioneer, said: 'It just keeps him going - we wish we could get it on prescription.

'If he is starting to feel a bit tired, maybe after he has been running around, it will just pick him up again straight away.

'Without a doubt, without that drink, we
would be in serious trouble. We’ve tried all sorts of different foods 
but this is the one for Archie.'

When Archie, from Stoke Orchard, Gloucestershire was born, he did not respond to the world around him and doctors initially misdiagnosed him as being on the autistic spectrum.

It was not until his second birthday that a routine blood and urine test revealed he had Propionic Aciduria.

Propionic Acidemia (PA) is a rare 
disorder that is inherited from both parents. Neither parent shows 
symptoms, but both carry a defective gene responsible for this 
disorder. 

People with PA 
cannot break down parts of protein and some types of fat due to either a
missing or a non-functioning enzyme called PCC.

This
inability causes a build-up of harmful substances which can cause 
damage to the person’s heart, liver, brain, and bones.  The result can 
be seizures, delays to normal development like walking and talking, and 
other health problems.

During times of illness, a patient with PA may need to be hospitalised to prevent breakdown of proteins within the body.

Every day a PA patient must try and get enough protein for normal growth - but not so much that they become ill.

Although some PA children learn to eat, most require tube feeding since they have little to no appetite and food aversions.

Unchecked, the condition would create toxic amino acids which would attack vital organs and eventually his entire body would shut down.

Mr Koncher and his wife Salli, 42, immediately swapped his normal milk and baby food for non-protein food and saw an overnight change.

Archie, who weighs barely five stone, now eats tiny portions alongside his parents and older brother Charlie, 16, but carefully avoids high protein foods like fish.

He now drinks up to four 380ml bottles of Lucozade a day, each containing 33g of sugar.

Mr Koncher added: He eats a lot of carbs too, like crisps and noodles, with the Lucozade too of course and anything high sugar.

'When he is well you wouldn’t know there was anything different about him, but he is about the height of an eight-year-old simply because he is eating so much less.'

His mother 42, an administrator, said: 'We are very lucky he is still alive - it is a silent killer.  You just don’t know what can happen.

'When he gets very lethargic, we have to be careful. When he vomits, we have to get him to hospital immediately.

'He can’t have too much protein. When we go to McDonald’s for a treat, he has to have the chips, and only half the burger, with no bun.

'For him, an egg is a treat. He can’t have any more. It’s heart-wrenching.

'We don’t know what the future holds but we are just happy that he is a happy little boy and loving life.'
