Two schoolboys who raped a girl aged just 10 avoided jail today because of their young age.

The boys were just 12 and 13 when they carried out the sex attack on the younger girl while playing on an Xbox console, Newport Crown Court in South Wales was told.

The girl kept it a secret for four months - until her mother caught her playing a game of dare with the same boys in woodland.

Judge Ian Murphy said: ‘Her parents have described their daughter as an empty shell and say her innocence was taken away from her.’

The court heard the two boys were playmates with the girl who lived nearby. They had been kicking a ball around when the weather became cold.

The three friends then went inside to play computer games on an Xbox. But the older boy encouraged his younger friend to have sex with the girl and he later joined in.

The boys, now both 14, denied rape but were found guilty at a trial last month. The judge ordered the boys to be electronically tagged for three months and put them under a 7pm to 7am curfew.

He told them: ‘This is a very serious offence. Had you been adults you would have been looking at a lengthy custodial sentence. You were very young at the time and used to play football with the little girl.

'You betrayed your friendship and you engaged in impulsive sexual exploration'

Judge Ian Murphy

'You betrayed your friendship and you engaged in impulsive sexual exploration. No force was used but she was only a little girl of 10.’

The court heard the girl was left damaged by the two older boys. The boys were given youth rehabilitation orders with intense supervision.

They will attend a sexual offences programme and go on the sex offenders’ register for two and a half years.
