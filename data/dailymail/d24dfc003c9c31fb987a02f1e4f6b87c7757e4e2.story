A cat lover tried to smother her husband after he failed to comfort her about the death of her pet.

Margaret Sandercock, 66, attacked her husband while grieving for 16-year-old Fluffy, who had been put down a few hours previously.

A court heard that she hoped her husband Graham, who has Parkinson’s disease, would give her a ‘cuddle’.

But his illness meant he could not express his emotions, and in her rage and frustration she twice attempted to smother him with a pillow, first at midnight and again at 3am.

Mr Sandercock, also 66, managed to fight her off and the next day his wife, a former  Royal British Legion standard bearer, was found drunk in a churchyard near the couple’s home in Trobridge, near Crediton, Devon.

She confessed to paramedics what she had done.

Yesterday she wept at Exeter Crown Court as she was spared jail. Mr Justice Butterfield said Sandercock had looked after her husband for 28 years without a break because he refused to go into respite care.

He described looking after someone with Parkinson’s as a ‘demanding, draining and difficult’ task.

He said: ‘She regrettably became dependent on alcohol to counter that very stressful and extremely debilitating role she found herself in, and she was very isolated, unappreciated and very lonely.’

The judge said Fluffy had been, for the defendant, one of the ‘sole things that gave her pleasure in this world’.

He added: ‘She turned to her husband for some expression of sympathy, care or comfort.

‘She got none and reacted in the way that she did. It was a wrong thing to do.’

The court heard that the provision of a carer had been withdrawn due to cutbacks.

Prosecutor Richard Crabb said that when Sandercock was arrested she told police: ‘My cat died and I just wanted him to talk to me.

‘I did not try to kill him. My cat had been put down and I had gone into his bedroom, I wanted a cuddle.

‘I cuddled the pillow. I did not want him dead.’

Sandercock was given a two-year community order after she admitted a charge of putting a person in fear of violence by harassment.

She is also subject to an indefinite restraining order banning any contact with her estranged husband.

He is now living away from the marital home.

The court heard that Sandercock referred to her husband’s disease as ‘Mr Parkinson’ and said that ‘he’ had ruined both their lives.
