Diamonds may be a girl’s best friend but, according to the Royal Mint, gold can also be a staunch ally if your nest egg is languishing in a low-interest savings account.

To encourage more ordinary savers to invest in precious metals, the Mint has set up a website to simplify the process.

It estimates that an extra £4billion could be invested in gold if the process of buying it or converting it into savings was easier.

The price of gold, which is valued internationally in US dollars, soared by around 450 per cent between 2000 and 2011

Experts said consumers had been put off because they thought buying precious metals and keeping them secure was too complex. They were also worried about finding a reputable dealer or being ripped off.

Buying bullion is also a gamble. Investors traditionally turn to gold as a haven in times of economic crisis and its value often falls when the going gets good.

The price of gold, which is valued internationally in US dollars, soared by around 450 per cent between 2000 and 2011, rising from £168 ($273) an ounce to £921 ($1,500). However it has since fallen back to around £778 ($1,268).

But the Royal Mint said its website would make buying gold and silver as in investment rather than as jewellery ‘relatively affordable’.

The site allows consumers to buy bullion in either gold or silver coins priced according to the fluctuating global rate, plus a premium.

The size of the coins is given in troy ounces, which are slightly heavier than standard ounces and are used for precious metals and gems. Ordinary investors can buy just a single gold coin, such as the 22-carat George & Dragon 2014 Sovereign, which weighs 0.2354 troy ounces, for around £199.

Alternatively, there is the 1oz Britannia Gold Bullion coin, which comes in at around £807.

However, there is no limit to how much bullion people can buy and the Mint has set up a special advice and storage service for people spending more than £50,000.

Customers can have the coins delivered to their home, or opt to have them stored in the Royal Mint’s secure storage vault, which is protected around the clock by the Ministry of Defence.

Storage fees are charged annually at 1 per cent plus VAT of the market value of the gold being held. The Royal Mint will also buy back customers’ gold coins that have been stored in its vault.

No VAT is paid on gold bullion coins, and the Britannia, Sovereign and Lunar bullion coins are also free of capital gains tax for UK residents because they are legal tender.

Shane Bissett, the Royal Mint’s director of commemorative coin, said: ‘Where the average consumer may have shunned gold due to perceived complexities, the Royal Mint can help make this option a much more accessible opportunity.

‘The quality of our bullion coins is of a standard which cannot be rivalled. We have been a highly respected and trusted source of coins for kings, queens and governments for over 1,000 years, and we are globally recognised as a reliable source for bullion coins.’
