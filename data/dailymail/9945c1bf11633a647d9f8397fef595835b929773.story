A carer was caught red-handed stealing money from an 88-year-old disabled widow’s purse by a hidden camera in a mantelpiece clock.

Carol Oldfield, 46, was filmed taking £10 from the purse of frail Molly Roberts, then turning around and saying ‘I won’t see you next week - I’m on holiday’.

Oldfield, from Chorley, Lancashire, was found guilty of breach of trust and was told to repay the £10 she stole by Preston Crown Court. She was also ordered to pay £200 in costs.

Caught red-handed: Carol Oldfield was filmed stealing £10 from the purse of an elderly amputee in Lancashire

The court heard she now intends to set up her own care company, despite pleading guilty and being given a 12-week jail term suspended for two years.

The court heard that Mrs Roberts’ daughter, Gwen Bode, regularly withdrew money for her mother, who is confined to a wheelchair after having her leg amputated.

She became suspicious when the cash started to quickly run out and got her husband to fit the spy camera.

Less than an hour later thieving Carol Oldfield arrived on a regular care visit - and immediately took £10 from Mrs Roberts’ purse when her back was turned.

Gwen, 59, a retired teacher, told the care company within hours of seeing the footage and police were alerted.

Oldfield, 46, was immediately suspended by the firm she worked for, Lancashire-based Crossroads Care.

Oldfield, who had worked for the company for 20 years, initially denied theft and claimed Mrs Roberts had given her the cash for some moisturising cream, but she eventually confessed.

She was branded as greedy and opportunistic by the judge.

Gwen said: ‘I just can’t believe someone would do this to my mum. She’s a lovely lady and has been through so much.

‘She even says if Carol had needed the money so much, which she didn’t, she would have lent her it if only she asked.

‘She has shattered my faith in human nature and now we lock all the doors all the time. My mum is totally shaken and feels she can’t trust anybody.

‘I can’t believe she wants to set up her own business. She shouldn’t be caring for anyone’.
