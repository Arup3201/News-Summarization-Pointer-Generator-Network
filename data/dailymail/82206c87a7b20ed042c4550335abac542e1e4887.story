Czech Prime Minister Petr Necas has announced that he will resign amid claims his chief-of-staff and alleged lover recruited government agents to spy on his wife.

Necas, 48, has been embroiled in a sleaze scandal that has seen seven people, including the current and former heads of the 
Military Intelligence agency and three former politicians of his party, charged with bribery or misuse of power.

But most sensational is the arrest of his closest aide and the head of his office Jana Nagyova who was charged with ordering a military intelligence agency to spy on three people, including Necas’ estranged wife, Radka.

Necas has insisted that he knew nothing of Nagyova's alleged skullduggery nor did she push him into divorcing his wife.

Nagyova is also alleged to have 
bribed three senior MPs to step down in return for lucrative jobs in 
state-run companies. She faces five years in jail for abuse of power if 
convicted.

She claims she ordered security 
services out of concern for Mrs Necas, far from the nefarious motives of
which she has been accused.

Her lawyer said: 'This [surveillance]
was not done for the reason of damaging someone or harming them but 
rather, due to being cautious, she rached the conclusion that it is 
necessary to find out some things.'

The ex wife: Necas refused to confirm or deny if Ms Nayova was the reason behind his divorce, finalised last week, to Radna (left), the mother of his four children and teenage sweetheart

Necas said he also will quit on Monday as chairman of his conservative Civic Democratic Party.

Asked directly if Ms Nayova was the 
reason behind his divorce, finalised last week, to the mother of his 
four children and teenage sweetheart, Necas responded: 'I consider these
things to be so bizarre that they do not deserve my comment.'

The alleged lover: Nagyova is also alleged to have bribed three senior MPs to step down in return for lucrative jobs in state-run companies. She faces five years in jail for abuse of power if convicted

'I am aware of my political responsibility,' Necas said.

His
decision will end his three-party coalition government, which was 
created after the 2010 parliamentary election. But Necas said he hopes 
it can stay in power until a parliamentary election planned next year.

This is an optimal solution of the current situation,' Necas said. Two coalition partners, the conservative TOP 09 party and the Liberal Democrats, agreed with that plan Sunday.

'We’re obliged to do all we can for the government to continue,' said Finance Minister Miroslav Kalousek, the deputy head of TOP 09.

That might not happen, however. It is up to the President Milos Zeman to select a new prime minister who would try to form a new government, and it is not immediately clear if he is ready to accept such a solution. The current coalition also doesn’t have a clear parliamentary majority and governs with the help from independent lawmakers.

Early elections also are not easy to call because it would have to be approved by three-fifths of the 200 lawmakers, and the opposition does not have enough seats to force it.

The negotiations between the parties 
are expected to start immediately, and it is not clear how much time 
they will need to find a solution to the crisis.

Earlier
this week, prosecutors said Nagyova was suspected of directing the 
alleged illegal surveillance without any authorization. In their 
explanation for the sweeping raids at government offices and other 
locations, they said Nagyova’s motives were 'purely private.'

Necas
announced earlier this week that he and his wife, Radka, have filed for
divorce. Newspapers have speculated about an affair between him and 
Nagyova.
