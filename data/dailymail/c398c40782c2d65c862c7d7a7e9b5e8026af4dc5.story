In a year littered with trophies, baubles, mementos and achievements, a simple letter perhaps means as much as anything to Stephen Gallacher.

That European team captain Paul McGinley should take time to write to one of his Ryder Cup rookies, the local lad who left Gleneagles without a point but with a headful of memories, said something about more than just the Irishman’s inspired leadership.

If some might feel that Gallacher may have regrets over his contribution to the home win, a foursomes defeat alongside Ian Poulter on the opening morning and then a singles loss to a turbocharged Phil Mickelson on the Sunday, the 40-year-old is at pains to dispel the myth.

The Scot, whose best year as a pro was rewarded with honorary membership of the PGA yesterday, says even that dysfunctional pairing with Poulter — something McGinley concedes was never given the pre-event time to develop — remains a fond recollection of his week in the Perthshire hills.

‘I wouldn’t take it back,’ said Gallacher. ‘It was absolutely brilliant, playing with Ian. Paul’s reasoning was that he told me I was playing the first morning.

‘And he said: “You’re standing there with the Saltire on and Poulter hasn’t been on form as normal — and the big crowd is what he loves to get him up to play his best. He’s out with you and you’ll have a massive following”.

Gallacher savoured the home support at Gleneagles despite his disappointing display 

‘He just thought that would be the spur and it obviously didn’t work. But neither of us played well. We only had one birdie. But I have no negativity about the Ryder Cup — only positives. I wouldn’t change it for anything.

‘Paul sent me a text first and then a letter at the Race to Dubai. He wrote everybody a letter. I’ll probably not show it to many people because it’s personal and it’s a mark of the man.

‘He talked to me about how I handled being left out on the Saturday, as did a few of my peers. There are 12 guys and you leave your egos at the door. It’s purely the result that you want and it doesn’t matter how it happens.

‘Yes, I would have liked to have played a bit more. But would I swap that and get beat? No, I wouldn’t.

‘Against Mickelson, that was probably as good as I’ve played all year. But you are playing one of the top guys outwith Tiger — what is it he’s got, five or six majors? Also, if he doesn’t go out and beat me, he can’t have a go at Tom Watson, who would have just turned around and said: “Well, you got beat...”

‘I held my head up high and I enjoyed it. I desperately want to play in the Ryder Cup again.

‘Paul’s given me a lot of confidence, not just with the letter and text. We’ve been in contact a lot. The stuff he said has been brilliant.’

Gallacher ends 2014 as world No 35, up 31 places in 12 months, while his European Tour earnings of £1.35million have been bolstered by eight top-10 finishes — including becoming the first player to defend the Dubai Desert Classic.

More impressive than anything, though, was his ferocious — and exhausting — charge to the brink of automatic Ryder Cup qualification. Missing out by the narrowest of margins, he was, the captain has since admitted, McGinley’s first pick as a wild card.

‘I’m definitely ready for a break,’ said the third member of Bathgate Golf Club’ s great Ryder Cup trio, following Eric Brown and his own uncle, Bernard Gallacher, into the famous team event.

‘This year, it’s one that’s going to be hard to top, you know. I’m going to have to work even harder and really be on the ball.

‘But the key is not to panic and try to do too much. I’ve done a lot this year. I think I had a first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth.

‘I’m very close. I just need to keep doing what I’m doing.

‘You never look back. You know you’ve had a good year — but all you’re trying to do is bottle that formula.

‘You don’t end up 34th or 35th in the world by having one good year. You’ve got to have two or three good years, or it cascades away.

‘I’m getting more consistent. I just want to improve slightly in places — that wee bit here and there — and who knows, you could be in the top 10 as quick as that. It’s such a fine margin.

‘Last year I had to chase the world points, so I was a wee bit out of my comfort zone playing in America when I didn’t really want to then, at the end, I played eight out of nine weeks.

‘But it’s testament to the physical work I’ve done that I could do that. One of the keys at the start of the year was having no injuries so I could dictate my schedule, play more if I need to. I’ve not had a twinge for a year. That’s a massive breakthrough.

‘You look at a football player who spends three weeks out. It can sometimes take them four or five weeks to get back. So, if I had to miss three of the biggest weeks, then there’s more pressure on me when I come back. And, if I don’ t settle right away, that’s two months lost, isn’t it?

‘I didn’t want any distractions. I wanted to play when I wanted, not when I felt like I needed time off. I feel as fresh at the end of the year as I did at the start of the year. That’s a massive change.

‘Generally, I get to the end of the year and feel a wreck. I cannae hit a shot. Now, I’ve had a week and a bit off just to give the golfing muscles a break.

It didn't take long for the champagne to start flowing after the trophy had been raised

‘The one thing I’ve learned this year is that my bad shots are better. I’m swinging better and hitting the ball better, so I’m pin high more. All the good putters give themselves chances. It’s hard if you’re hitting it to 40 feet.

‘My game is improving, and it comes down to putting.

‘I went to see (short game guru) Dave Stockton and he made a difference, so I’ ll try to see him again in January for a refresher.’
