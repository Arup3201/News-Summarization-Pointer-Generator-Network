Secretary of State John Kerry was joined by five of his predecessors Wednesday at the groundbreaking of the U.S. Diplomacy Center in Washington, DC.

Speaking at the groundbreaking of the new museum celebrating the achievements of American diplomacy, Kerry gave a speech, warning against creeping American isolationism, making the case that U.S. global leadership is needed more than ever.

Kerry was joined at the State Department ceremony by his predecessors Henry Kissinger, James A. Baker III, Madeleine Albright, Colin Powell and Hillary Rodham Clinton. Of the seven living ex-secretaries of state, all of whom are honorary directors of the U.S. Diplomacy Center, only Condoleezza Rice and George Shultz were not present.

Good job: In his speech, Kerry praised the various work his predecessors did in representing American interests around the world during their time as secretary of state 

'American leadership and engagement should not be up for debate in the first place,' Kerry said, listing Iraq, Syria, Ukraine, Gaza, South Sudan, Libya and North Korea as among the trouble spots that Washington must address. 'I'm not saying that we can or should do any of it alone; that's not the proposition, but the world — and I think most people here understand — will not do it without us.'

'I can tell you for certain, most of the world does not lie awake at night worrying about America's presence,' he said. 'They tell me that they worry about what would happen in our absence... We have to remember, engagement and leadership, not retrenchment and isolationism, are the American DNA.'

Kerry hailed each of the previous secretaries who attended the event.

Telling secrets? Clinton and Kerry laugh to themselves, seated next to Colin Powell at the ceremony on Wednesday

Female leaders: Hillary Clinton reaches out to hold the hand of Madeleine Albright, the first female Secretary of State who served during her husband Bill Clinton's presidency 

Service: Henry Kissinger (left) served under presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, James A Baker III (second left) served George H.W. Bush, Madeleine Albright (center) served Bill Clinton, Colin Powell (second right) served George W Bush and Hillary Clinton (right) served current President Barack Obama before stepping down last year

He praised Clinton for breathing new life into old partnerships and giving meaning to 'personal diplomacy' and Powell for uniting the world against al-Qaeda after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

Albright 'epitomizes moral leadership and continues to inspire American diplomats wherever they serve' for her work in ending the conflicts in Kosovo and Bosnia, Kerry said.

Baker, he said, created 'the gold standard by which modern coalition-building is judged' in the run-up to the 1991 Gulf War. 

Kerry said he would use it as a guide as he embarks on a mission to forge a united front against Islamic militants operating in Iraq and Syria. 

This way! Kerry, right, leads Clinton, Albright and Kissinger to the site of the groundbreaking next to the U.S. State Department building 

In style: The former secretaries of state broke ground on the new museum using specially engraved ceremonial shovels 

Manual labor: Clinton, Albright, Kissinger, Kerry, Baker and Powell push their shovels into the dirt to officially start construction on the new museum 

Kerry did not mention that the coalition that Baker built included Syria, a country the Obama administration has vowed not to work with in the fight against the extremists.

And, Kissinger 'literally wrote the book on diplomacy,' Kerry said.

The US Diplomacy Center, being constructed with $25million in privately raised money, will be located at the State Department and comprise 40,000 square feet of interactive exhibits and artifacts and will offer educational programs. 

It is expected to be completed in about 18 months.

Looking forward: The U.S. Diplomacy Center is expected to be completed in about 18 months. It is being built with $25million in privately raised money
