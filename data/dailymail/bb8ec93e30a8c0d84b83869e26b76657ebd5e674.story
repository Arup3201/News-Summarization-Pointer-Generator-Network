In 2013, Manchester United's goalkeeping coach Frans Hoek gave an interview to a Dutch newspaper in which he spoke at length about Victor Valdes. His appreciation is clear.

'Victor is a goalkeeper but he is also the 11th outfield player and capable of constructing play. [Chelsea's Thibaut] Courtois for example is physically imposing and has charisma but he does not have this ability to construct the game.'

'The work of Valdes at Barcelona consists 80 per cent of the time in constructing play, while the other 20 per cent of the time he does the normal work of a goalkeeper. He receives very few shots against his goal.'

Given the way that United have defended at times this season, Valdes may soon see those percentages radically change and he may find himself tested with an unfamilar regularity.

Nonetheless, Hoek was making reference to one of Valdes' greatest strengths as a goalkeeper. The first roots of the Barcelona model of possession football were laid by Louis van Gaal and he imposed a school of thought that a goalkeeper must contribute to different phases of the game and is not only there to prevent the ball going into his net. It means he is there to build attacks, to mop up the danger and prevent the opposition from creating opportunities.

Hoek is the advisor that Van Gaal leans on most heavily and he is believed to be the world's best at developing this kind of goalkeeper, the sweeper-keeper. Manuel Neuer is deemed to be the best at this but Valdes has been at it for some time now. Pepe Reina is another Hoek protege.

David de Gea, equally, is more than adept with the ball at his feet - he played for his school team as a striker until the age of 14 - but he does not impose his personality on the game excessively.

That may be something to do with the more conservative instincts of his previous coaches, principally Emilio Alvarez Blanco at Atletico Madrid and Eric Steele at Manchester United. What they admired above all in De Gea was his tranquility.

When I asked Blanco whether De Gea is now a match for Neuer, he answered: 'Better than Neuer, even. Neuer is an unbelievable goalkeeper with extraordainary ability, but for me he can be a little too impulsive. For me, a goalkeeper is someone that is usually calm and should not create moments of insecurity for the team. David never does this.'

'David, at the very start, was defined by his calmness in the goal. This is the most important quality for a goalkeeper. David showed a maturity beyond his years, he understood the tactical, technical and mental aspects of the game.

'For me, he is the perfect goalkeeper in the modern game. in terms of his height, his weight, his pace, agile, if we were to make goalkeepers in a factory, he wouldn't be far off. If we were to design a goalkeeper on a computer programme, in terms of height, pace, agility, the length of his arms, his reach, the size of his hands, it would come out with David de Gea.'

Van Gaal and Hoek appreciate De Gea's talents - how could you not this season? - but this may be one part of his game that they are keen to develop. Those who watch United frequently will notice that De Gea has begun to take a more commanding approach in recent months and take a few more chances to deal with danger. His improved English undoubtedly has contributed to this but the Hoek effect is also taking shape.

His game has also noticeably come on since Valdes began training with United in the autumn. That may be a coincidence but De Gea is somebody that responds well to competition. As a teenager at the Atletico Madrid academy, he spent time behind Everton's Joel Robles in the pecking order. To break into the senior team, he had to dislodge two goalkeepers, Sergio Asenjo and the experienced Roberto. He will not be frightened by Valdes' reputation, only energised. This is the environment that Hoek will be aiming to create.

Hoek's status in European football could barely be higher. In 2013, he was invited by Manchester City to address their entire academy. On a special day visit, he fielded questions from City's coaches and then led a meticulously-prepared session on possession football and playing out of defence. One observer revealed that City were 'blown away' by the extent of Hoek's knowledge and expertise.

In Catalonia, they still marvel at Hoek's dedication and talent. At Barcelona, he monitored Valdes' progress regularly during Van Gaal's first spell between 1996 and 2000, when he would take responsibility for the coaching of goalkeepers throughout the entire structure of the club. He would often go along to the Under 15 and U16 team to put on a session for Valdes and his contemporaries.

Last month, I spent some time with Martinez Vilaseca, who worked at Barcelona for 29 years and directed the famous La Masia academy.

'Frans Hoek, for me is the best goalkeeper coach in the world,' Vilaseca began, 'I have never seen anybody else like him in the football world.

'With Van Gaal, he was training the goalkeepers from age 10 and 11 through to the first team. Hoek did stunning work with Victor Valdes, Pepe Reina, now I think that De Gea has improved rapidly with this coach.

'De Gea is now the No 1 goalkeeper for Spain and Hoek is the best in the world. De Gea has always had the potential, we all knew that in Spain. He has come through the age groups, U17 World Championships etc. With the coaches he has had, he has developed his authority and composure.'

As things stand, De Gea remains first choice but he will be challenged. Yet challenges await Valdes, also. Van Gaal knows him well - he handed him his debut at Barcelona in 2002 - but he is not the sympathetic kind.

Long-term injuries are mentally, as well as physically gruelling. He may privately have wondered whether his body will be the same again. Will he still be as fast? Will he still be as agile? Can he rediscover the form that leads many in Barcelona to believe he is the club's greatest goalkeeper?

In European games against English sides, he sometimes appeared vulnerable under the high ball. There may be the kind of culture shock that De Gea experienced in his early days, although his experience, you would think, would prevent major problems.

Valdes will need to improve his English significantly but he is already placing roots in Manchester. His family will move over and they will find a seven-seater car already waiting for them. He is now house-hunting in the Wilmslow area.

Evidently, he is not at Old Trafford to twiddle his thumbs. At Barcelona, he won 21 trophies, including three UEFA Champions League medals. United now have two world-class goalkeepers. Let the battle commence.
