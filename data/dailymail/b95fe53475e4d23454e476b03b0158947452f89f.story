Lee Cattermole wants fans to stop doubting Gus Poyet after the Sunderland boss felt moved to pen an open letter asking for their support.

But on the evidence of Saturday’s sour stalemate with West Brom – an eighth goalless draw of the season – it will take more than the words of terrace favourite Cattermole to convince followers that all is well at the Stadium of Light.

‘There are no doubts, we are all pushing in the same direction,’ insisted the midfielder, who was just about the best English performer in front of the watching Roy Hodgson.

‘We can’t be drawn in to any doubt about the manager. There is no-one thinking like that inside the club.

‘If anyone is doubting that then you have to look at the whole picture - we are getting better and the whole club feels more stable. We just need to get the results.

‘It was only a year and a half ago that we had a big carry on at the club. But change doesn’t happen overnight. You have to get players in and out. You have to be patient in football.’

Patience, however, will be wearing thin after Sunderland’s 13th draw of the campaign, a result which leaves them two places above the drop zone.

In fairness, supporters did respond to Poyet’s call for backing, but that had little to do with the football being offered on the pitch.

Adam Johnson was denied a legitimate goal by a linesman’s flag but it was a match low on quality and entertainment.

But Cattermole is adamant they are getting better.

‘Let’s not forget what happened last season,’ he said. ‘All the players, even the senior players, will say they have improved under him.

‘We are definitely more solid now. All the lads are behind the manager we just have to keep pushing.’

He added: ‘The manager has been very honest and has come out and said an awful lot. He wants the fans to know directly from him.

‘I am in and around it every day and I think this club is heading in the right direction.’
