Violent man: Rusty Smith admitted to cops he was high on methamphetamine when he threw rocks at three people and attacked one of them with a bed frame

Police say a drug addicted ex-con with a history of violence attacked
three people with rocks and a bed frame while high on methamphetamine.

Rusty Smith, 37, of
Mesa, Arizona, is sobering up in jail after the bizarre drug-fueled attack Wednesday
afternoon that led to his arrest.

Mr Smith was arguing with two women in a seedy part of town
when an unidentified man tried to break up the fight, according to a police
report cited by AZ Central. Things quickly escalated.

The disturbed man began throwing rocks at all three of his
helpless victims, striking the man across the bridge of his nose, police said.

Mr Smith then ran to a nearby dumpster, grabbed a bed frame
and wildly swung it at the man, hitting him in the legs and chest, the report
said.

Police may have arrived just in time to save the at least
man’s life, if not the lives of all three of his victims.

Cops say they observed Mr Smith holding a brick wrapped in a
shirt while shouting at them as they arrived.

He admitted to being high on methamphetamine while during
his violent outburst and that he was a daily user, authorities said.

Scene of the crime: The dumpster where Mr Smith likely found the bed frame he used to attack his victim

The drug addled ex-con was booked on three counts of
disorderly conduct, a charge of aggravated assault dangerous incident and
violation of a court order, according to AZ Central.

Mr Smith’s arrest violated the terms of his probation
stemming from a March 2013 release after serving six years behind bars for auto
theft, records showed.

He also has multiple drug and assault convictions, as well
as repeated violations of an order of protection placed against him.
