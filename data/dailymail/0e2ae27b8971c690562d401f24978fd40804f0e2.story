QPR have failed in a bid to swap Matt Phillips for Callum McManaman of Wigan.

Phillips has played a bit-part role at the struggling R's so far this season, but was reluctant to drop down a division and wants to stay and fight for his place at Loftus Road instead.

The clubs also discussed the possibility of a deal for Shaun Maloney for whom Wigan have already agreed a £1million fee with Leicester.

Wigan Athletic winger Callum McManaman is on QPR's radar

QPR are discussing Standard Liege winger Paul-Jose M'Poku, 22, formerly of Tottenham.

The 22-year-old wants a move back to England and his agent has sounded out several Premier League clubs.

Harry Redknapp is keen on signing a wide man this month, but may be forced to sell to raise funds for new arrivals.
