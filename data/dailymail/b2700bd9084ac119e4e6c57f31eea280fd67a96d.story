He gained worldwide fame earlier this year after being declared the smallest man in then world, but Chandra Bahadur Dangi is now taking big steps on his journey to super-stardom.

The 72-year-old from Nepal, who measures just 21.5inches (54.6cm) tall, has attracted an army of fans since claiming the Guinness World Record as the world's shortest man in February.

Three months on, Australians at Sydney International Airport appeared to be struck down with 'Dangi fever' as the tiny superstar arrived Down Under for a radio appearance.

Australia's Nova FM had decided to bring Dangi to their country from his native Nepal - only the second time he has ever left his home country.

Dangi, wearing a traditional Nepalese hat, was greeted at the airport with cries of, 'Dangi!' and 'He's so cute!' as he got to grips with his new-found fame before being whisked away from the airport.

After his radio appearance, Dangi will visit sights including Sydney Wildlife Park and Bondi Beach during his whistle-stop tour.

Radio station Nova FM said they had arranged for Dangi to come to Australia, and are also making a donation to his remote home village in Nepal, located 400km from Kathmandu.

Dangi, the seventh sibling of a family of six brothers and two sisters, does not remember his father and his mother, who died when he was 16-years-old. His immediate older brother and family have looked after him.

Three of his five brothers were less than four feet tall, while his two sisters and two brothers are of average height.

Dangi only left his village, Reemkholi in Dang district, for the first time five years ago.

Asked why he did not stake a claim earlier to be declared the shortest man, he said his family was unaware of such a record, because they are uneducated.

He overtook the previous shortest man Junrey Balawing of the Philippines, who is 23.5 inches (60 centimeters) tall.

He had claimed the title last year from Khagendra Thapa Magar, 18, whose height is 26 inches tall.

Dangi, who wears a traditional hat and tailor-made clothing, was looking forward to receiving the accolade after remaining out of the media spotlight all his life.

He said: 'I feel good that I will be declared the world's shortest man.'

Dangi claims he has never taken any kind of medication or been examined by a doctor.

He admits he suffers the odd cold, but revealed he has a home remedy, saying: 'At such times I drink hot water and have tumeric power dissolved in water. The fever lasts for two to three days.

'I haven't been ill probably because my body is good.'Â
