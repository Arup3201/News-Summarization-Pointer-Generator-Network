These baby dwarf crocodiles are part of a record breeding programme at Britain’s only crocodile zoo.

Shaun Foggett, who starred in successful television series Croc Man, is thrilled to have bred 24 dwarf caiman crocodiles with eight more to hatch any day now.

At Crocodiles Of The World in Witney, Oxfordshire, Mr Foggett has no problem handling these babies but that might change when they are fully grown, up to 4.9ft long.

Happy hatchings: Shaun Foggett has successfully bred 24 dwarf caiman crocodiles at the UK's only crocodile zoo

Mr Foggett, the 33-year-old owner of the zoo, tried to breed the crocodiles 12 months ago but only one dwarf caiman hatched out of 14 eggs so this time around he was thrilled with the outcome.

He attributed the successful births to special vitamins he fed the newborns’ parents.

He said: ‘Last year, we had one out of 14 eggs that hatched so this year has been incredibly successful.

The baby crocodiles are about eight inches long and weigh about 1.5 ounces at the moment but will grow up to 4.9ft long

‘All the babies are okay. They are doing well and swimming around.

‘They are about eight inches long and weigh about 1.5 ounces at the moment.’

The hatchings are part of the zoo’s conservation programme and its success means Mr Foggett will have to move into bigger premises in the near future to make room for the new arrivals.

The breed is thought to be the most primitive of all crocodiles and originates from northern and central South America.

Threats to the species include habitat destruction and pollution such as through gold mining activities. 

Collection for the pet trade has also reduced populations in some countries.

Conservation programme: Mr Foggett tried to breed this species last year but only one of 14 eggs hatched, so this time he was very pleased with the new additions at Crocodiles of the World

Mr Foggett said: ‘We are the only crocodile zoo in the UK but a lot of what we do is about conservation work for crocodile species.

‘Probably about half will stay with us and we have had a great deal of interest from other zoos for the other half.'

The eggs were removed after their two mothers buried them in dirt and bark. Mr Foggett kept them at a constant 30⁰C for 100 days until they hatched.

He said: ‘They are fed on a diet on insects such as locusts and crickets but will move on to dead rodents and small chickens and rabbits.’

Five weeks ago 14 West African dwarf crocodiles were also born, making Mr Foggett the first private breeder to hatch the species.

Interest from others: Half the babies will stay at the zoo in Witney, Oxfordshire while the other half will go to other zoos. Mr Foggett said he has already had a great deal of interest

The baby crocodiles will join the 12 different species of crocodiles at the zoo including an endangered 10ft Siamese crocodile and a Chinese alligator, a species with only 120 left in the wild.

Mr Foggett, a married father of three, has always been fascinated by crocodiles and began keeping reptiles from the age of 15.

After studying the husbandry of crocodiles, he began to keep them privately before selling his family home to build and open the zoo in February last year.

Mr Foggett starred in television series Croc Man, a wildlife documentary series which followed the zoo’s opening.

The series was highly successful, with a peak audience of more than one million viewers for the final episode in August 2011.

The zoo is now a popular tourist attraction.
