Busted: Michael R Mastro had been hiding out in the French Alps with his wife Linda for 16 months

A bankrupt Seattle real estate magnate and his wife have been arrested in France more than a year after allegedly skipping out on $250million in debts.

Michael and Linda Mastro, age 87 and 63, were arrested on Wednesday at the idyllic Lake Annecy in the French Alps - where they had been hiding out after their $2billion real estate empire fell apart.

The couple fled after refusing to hand over a pair of massive diamond rings Mrs Mastro owned. The rings were 27.8 carats and 15.9 carats and worth more than $1.4million combined.

They were found in the small village of Doussard in eastern France near the Swiss border, where they had been renting a house under their own name for 16 months, the Seattle Times reports. 

U.S. authorities are currently working to extradite them back to Seattle.

They face six counts of federal bankruptcy fraud as part of the biggest bankruptcy case in Washington state history. 

In 2009, Mr Mastro claimed $587million in debts and $250million in assets. That debt is estimated at $250million today.

In the heyday of their real estate business, the Mastros lived on top of the world.

The couple owned a Bentley convertible, a Rolls Royce, a Land Rover and a Mercedes-Benz.

They vacationed in Italy, Switzerland, France, New York, and Palm Springs, Florida.

They bought expensive works of art, including dozens of sculptures by renowned artist Dale Chihuly. 

When their real estate empire collapsed, federal authorities say, the couple tired to hide the assets from creditors, according to the Times.

Hanging on: This is one of the massive diamond rings that the Mastros refused to give up

They allegedly set up shell companies in Belize and the state of Delaware and transferred ownership of their home in California, as well as their cars and Mrs Mastro's expensive jewelry.

Even after they filed bankruptcy, they continued to drive luxury cars and take lavish vacations to resorts all over the world, the Times reports.

In June 2011, after a judge ordered them to turn over the lavish rings, they moved out of their expansive home in Palm Desert California and fled.

Federal authorities say they missed the couple in Toronto, Canada, by just days.

And then, for 16 months, they disappeared.

In their absence, many of their belongings were sold at auction, in an effort to cover their debts.

Among the estate was a Chihuly chandelier, a Steinway baby grand piano, 56 designer handbags. 65 pairs of high heels and a Bentley convertible.

The total from that sale was $341,000.

In January, a judge ordered $2.8million from the Mastro's assets to be distributed to creditors -- just one penny on the millions owed by the couple.
