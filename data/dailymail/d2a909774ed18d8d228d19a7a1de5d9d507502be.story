From the sheen of grease on the strips of bacon to the moisture on a piece of melon, this selection of food looks nothing short of mouthwatering.

However, the work of Japanese artist Norihito Hatanaka, these delicious-looking dishes are, in fact, fashioned out of plastic.

Norihito usually works producing food and meal displays for restaurants and shops but said his love of fashion inspired him to create jewellery using the art.

Looking like it has come straight from the frying pan, this crispy bacon belt is in fact made of plastic 

Jingling twice-cooked pork is fashioned into a colourful - and original - statement necklace 

The pieces, such as this succulent fresh fruit necklace, are the work of Japanese artist Norihito Hatanaka

These bacon lardon earrings look so realistic you may find people becoming hungry when talking to you 

Perhaps an option more for the adventurous fashionista, his collection includes hats, necklaces, earrings and bracelets spanning all types of sweet and savory meals. 

On his website he explains: 'I considered what should I create to expose the fake food to the public.

'And as I was interested in fashion, I decided to make accessories that have a food motif. I get inspired for my work from casual daily scenery. 

'Easily available common food items are charming as they are, though people sometimes don’t notice that. 

Norihito said food is beautiful enough to become art, such as this neapolitan spaghetti and sausage necklace

The artist's efforts are usually turned towards making display meals for restaurants and shops 

While we're not sure how this would go down at Ascot, this noodle burrito certainly is interesting 

Nibble on my neck! This pizza wrap around necklace would certainly ensure all eyes were on you
