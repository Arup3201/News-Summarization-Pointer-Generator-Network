One of the occupants of the quarantined apartment where America's first Ebola patient had stayed appeared for the first time today -wearing a t-shirt which read: 'You Only live Once'.

The man in his early 20s carried in a stack of 26 boxes that had been left outside the front door while wearing the black t-shirt which also had the words YOLO on it.

He pulled his hat down over his face as he handed the supplies to somebody else just behind the door who stayed out of sight.

YOLO: One of the occupants of the quarantined apartment where America's first Ebola patient had stayed appeared for the first time today -wearing a t-shirt which read: 'You Only live Once'

First: The man appeared calm as he emerged to bring inside the piles of food dropped off for him and the apartment's other occupants

The man did not respond when asked: 'Are you OK?'

YOLO is a slogan used by young people to say that you should seize the day. However according to Urban Dictionary it is also used by people who behave in a foolish manner to try and forget about something they later regret. 

At 1pm the Red Cross arrived and a worker dressed in a faded green t-shirt left box of food and bag of supplies by the front door.

Bringing aid: A North Texas Food Bank van also arrived and two men in jeans and t-shirts - one had a high visibility vest on - joined the Red Cross worker in carrying more boxes up to the door of the apartment

Supplied: Inside the shipment was Gatorade, water, potatoes and bananas along with what appeared to be paper towels.

Minutes later the man emerged but went back inside and put his hat on before coming out again.

A short while before a resident had walked past saying he was leaving his apartment in the complex because it was 'not safe'

He said: 'I'm going to my uncle's. I can't be around here with this going on'. 

Patient number 1: Thomas Eric Duncan became the first person to bring Ebola to the United States and is quarantined at Texas Presbyterian after developing symptoms of Ebola last Thursday. He first got sick inside the house from which the YOLO shirt-wearing young man emerged
