A young man who was angry at a cat for eating his dog's food filmed himself as he choked the feline and then threw the small animal across the street as retribution for its actions. 

The teenager, who lives in Cleveland, Ohio, had originally posted the video to Facebook, but took it down on Saturday.

Now, the Cleveland Animal Protective League is investigating the situation, and members of the public are hoping law enforcement officials will also launch an investigation.

Not sorry: The teenager (above) posted the video to Facebook, saying he attacked the cat after it ate his dog's food

The cat, which has been named Claryssa, is now in the care of the APL according to ABC 5. 

And while the young man has taken the video down, he continues to defend his actions on his Facebook, even making light of the situation and again blaming the cat for what happened.

In the video, the boy grips the cat by the throat, showing it off to the camera as he says, 'You think it's a mother******* game, huh? Keep on eating my dog food. You hear me? I'll choke the s*** out of your dumb a**.'

This goes on for 10 seconds before he then launches the cat across the street, and it quickly runs off. 

'We are now checking our findings with CPD's Bureau of Detectives who are also looking into this and when we put everything together we will be figuring out what our next steps will be based on the evidence and where that takes us,' said Sharon Harvey, CEO of the APL, in a statement.

Harvey also thanked the public for the outpouring of information they have been providing the agency, making it easier for them to work on this case and hopefully see that justice is done. 

As for the unnamed teen, who works at Abercrombie & Fitch according to his Facebook and seems to be named Noah, he has yet to apologize for his actions.
