Zlatan Ibrahimovic has delivered his seal of approval to John Guidetti and insisted the striker deserves to be back in the Sweden squad.

The Paris St Germain superstar took a verbal swipe at Guidetti last year when he suggested the 22-year-old should do more on the pitch and less talking to the media.

Now, however, Ibrahimovic admits the on-loan Celtic forward has stepped up to the mark with nine goals in 10 games since moving north from Manchester City.

Asked about Guidetti’s form in Scotland, he joked: ‘Good, very good. Does that mean he has listened?

‘He has played, made many goals and it’s good that he lets his feet speak. That’s the way he should go on, let your feet speak for themselves. You just have to continue.

‘The doors have always been open, and it’s about how you are performing in your club team. It’s all about how you perform in your club team.

‘John has done so wonderfully well in the Under 21s. That’s how he should go on.’

Guidetti now hopes to get the chance to link with Ibrahimovic in Sweden’s forthcoming games against Montenegro and France.

Despite the past criticism sent in his direction, Guidetti regards his national captain as an inspiration.

‘I don’t know him really well,’ he said. ‘We’re not buddies who go out for coffee.

Ibrahimovic revealed he is pleased that Swedish team-mate Guidetti 'lets his feet speak' 

‘But he is an amazing player and probably the best Sweden has ever had.

‘He is our captain and someone we respect on and off the pitch. Of course, he is someone you look up to and strive to be like.

‘Is he better than Henrik Larsson? I don’t know, it’s tight. I think Henrik was unbelievable but Zlatan is hard to beat in Sweden.

‘He has his own stamp, his own word in the dictionary. He is pretty big...

‘I have read his book. It’s one of the few books I have read. It’s the only book I’ve read!

‘It’s a great story, a great book to read. He is a great character in Swedish football.

‘As I said, I don’t really hang out with him but he has been alright with me. He has been cool.

Guidetti has been in sensational form for Celtic, scoring nine goals in 10 games 

‘We play the same position so he is always good talking to you.

‘Will I ever write a book like Zlatan? I will have to go and train harder if I want to do that because I have a lot to live up to!

‘I don’t know, I just try to stay in the present and work hard. I think a book is far away.’

Deference doesn’t come easy to Guidetti and he insisted he doesn’t change his demeanour when Ibrahimovic is around.

‘I’m always myself,’ he said. ‘If you try to walk through life always trying to change for other people then you will have nothing to do other than be an absolute schizophrenic. You will be trying to be someone else all the time.

‘You just have to be yourself. If someone doesn’t like you then at the end of the day that is their problem, not your problem. You can only be who you are and I have been the same person since I grew up, really. I was a cocky little s**t when I was three and I’m a cocky little s**t now.

‘It’s just me. Either you love me or you hate me but I am always going to be myself.

‘I do it with a good heart. I try to do it with love.’

Guidetti’s prolific loan spell with Feyenoord aged 19 saw the Swedish media tag him as the next Ibrahimovic. Yet his progress was stalled – and his career placed in doubt – following a virus which attacked his nervous system following a bout of food poisoning.

It is only now, at Parkhead, that he is back in regular football and trying to live up to the expectations of his homeland.

‘I don’t know if it’s pressure,’ he said. ‘People will always say or write that I’m destroying my career, that I’m injured and asking why is he staying at Manchester City, blah, blah, blah.

‘I don’t want to be injured. It’s not that I don’t want to play football. Football is the best thing in the world. It’s what I enjoy the most.

‘Sometimes people on the outside don’t understand the whole story. They have to understand that any footballer wants to play football, that he doesn’t want to be injured.

‘I couldn’t stop injuries and I always try and do my best. I’ll keep doing that and hope it goes well.

‘Being called by Sweden is a bonus. It’s an honour to be called up for your country of course. But we have done such great things with the under 21s that we have things to look forward to there.

‘We play the Euro Finals next summer and the first team was not in my mind. I’ve been there before and it’s great to be back but, as I say, it’s more of a bonus.’
