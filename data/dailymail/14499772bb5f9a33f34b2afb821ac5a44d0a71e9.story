Stephanie Sanpher, 13, died of meningitis after paramedics took two hours to get her to hospital

The grieving mother of a teenage meningitis victim says more could have been done to save her daughter’s life after paramedics took two hours to get her to hospital.

Stephanie Sanpher, 13, collapsed on January 31 after staying off school with a sore throat.

Her mother Joanne, 36, saw red marks on her body and called an ambulance when she started to vomit.

A rapid response car arrived at their home in Dersingham, Norfolk, after four minutes - but an ambulance did not turn up until 84 minutes after the 999 call, Ms Sanpher says.

Ms Sanpher says by the time the ambulance arrived, Stephanie, who had epilepsy, was critically ill and medics at hospital could not save her.

She said: ‘They didn’t help her in time and that left her brain damaged.

‘The hospital did a great job, but it was too late by the time she got to the hospital, she was already brain damaged.’

She added: ‘We loved her so much. She was absolutely our world. She was the most kind and understanding girl.

‘She never judged anybody, was just an angel and no trouble. She loved the TV series Hollyoaks and the band, One Direction.

‘She was one of those girls that everybody loves. She could go into a room full of strangers and they would immediately take to her.’

Stephanie’s brother Alex, 10, said his sister was ‘always helpful and played games’ with him.

An East of England Ambulance Service Trust (EEAST) spokesman confirmed it had a call from Stephanie’s mother at 12:07pm but says it has not received a formal complaint from her.

Ms Sanpher says a rapid response car was on the scene within four minutes but an ambulance did not arrive until 1.31pm.

Stephanie's mother, Joanne, says Stephanie had already suffered brain damage by the time she reached Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn. Despite their best efforts, doctors were unable to save her

She added that Stephanie did not reach the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King’s Lynn, Norfolk, until 2.03pm - two hours after her initial call.

The seven mile journey from her house to the hospital takes 13 minutes.

The call was classed as ‘red’ - the highest priority. The EEAST’s policy states red calls should be responded to within eight minutes 75 per cent of the time.

Early warning signs of bacterial meningitis - the more serious form - include pain in the muscles, joints or limbs, unusually cold hand and feet, shivering and pale or blotchy skin.

The next symptoms to develop are often a severe headache, fever, nausea, vomiting and feeling generally unwell.

As the condition develops the patient may suffer drowsiness, confusion, fits, a fear of bright lights, a stiff neck, fast breathing and a blotchy red rash that does not fade when a glass is pressed against it.

In babies and young children the symptoms include being floppy and unresponsive, becoming irritable and not wanting to be held, unusual crying, vomiting, pale and blotchy skin, loss of appetite, a staring expression and being very sleepy.

Stephanie was transferred to 
Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge by the Children’s Acute Transport 
Service (CATS) from Great Ormond Street Hospital but she died four days 
later.

Dr Anthony Marsh, EEAST Chief Executive, said: 'We’re extremely saddened to hear that Stephanie died following her collapse last Friday, and send the family our condolences.

'Our first paramedic on scene did everything possible we would expect from an initial response, but clearly Stephanie’s condition deteriorated and an ambulance should have been with her more quickly for which we apologise.

'The Trust is in the process of recruiting 400 student paramedics and has taken immediate steps to increase ambulance cover in Norfolk.'

Cases of bacterial meningitis have halved in the past 25 years but it still affects 3,200 a year. One in ten of those who contract the illness die.

Stephanie’s headteacher Jon Goodchild, at Smithdon High School in Hunstanton, Norfolk, said: ‘Stephanie was a kind and caring girl. Staff and students remember her beautiful singing voice and really valued her friendship - she was often the one who would bring a smile to friends’ faces when they needed cheering up, and try to make things better.

‘We are all so very sad and our thoughts are with Stephanie’s family - we can only offer them our most sincere sympathy, love and support.’

The case has been described as an ‘isolated incident’ by Public Health England.

Dr Giri Shankar, consultant in communicable disease control at Public Health England Anglia and Essex, said: ‘Parents of children at the school have been advised they are not at an increased risk as a result of this case and should not be absent from school.

‘However, it is important for everyone to be aware of the symptoms of meningitis, particularly in young children. If you notice any of these, seek medical advice straight away.’

Tragedy: Last March three-month-old Bella Hellings died when paramedics took three times the target time to reach her

This incident follows a catalogue of errors and ambulance delays by the EEAST.

Last
 March three-month-old Bella Hellings died when paramedics took three 
times the target time to reach her after getting lost twice and then 
stopping en route to refuel.

The same month an ambulance took two hours to reach a pensioner who had suffered a fall just four miles away from their base.

And in August last year another blunder led to the death of teenager Elouise Keeling, 14, who died when she had an asthma attack on an Army Cadets sports day.

On that occasion paramedics took twice the target response time after they drove to the wrong address and a second ambulance had to be sent.

Norman Lamb was attacked in the House of Commons by Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham on Wednesday for being complacent about the EEAST’s shortcomings.
