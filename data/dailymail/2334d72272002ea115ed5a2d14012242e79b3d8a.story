Campaign: On some days, Brenda Leyland, pictured, would send 50 messages attacking the McCanns

A woman found dead after being accused of trolling Madeleine McCann’s parents had sent thousands of Twitter messages about the couple, it was revealed yesterday.

Brenda Leyland, 63, tweeted that she ‘hated’ Kate and Gerry McCann and launched online diatribes about their behaviour in the aftermath of their daughter’s disappearance.

But unlike other ‘internet trolls’, she did not appear to have made threats against the couple and her death prompted outrage from some over the decision to expose her.

Divorcee Mrs Leyland was found dead in a hotel room on Saturday, three days after she was unmasked as one of dozens of online critics who had posted messages about the McCanns.

Facebook groups and online petitions called for a public inquiry into Sky News’s decision to confront her over the Twitter messages and subsequent newspaper coverage.

Ofcom received 60 complaints about the Sky News report, which did not name Mrs Leyland but referred to her by her Twitter name @sweepyface. 

A spokesman for the broadcasting regulator said: ‘It’s important to stress that we’ve not reached a view as to whether an investigation will take place.’

A dossier of online abuse has been passed to prosecutors which included threats against the McCanns and their twins, now aged nine. 

There is no suggestion the threats were made by Mrs Leyland.

The mother-of-two began tweeting about the case in December 2010, when she accused others of ‘unhelpful and uninspired trolling’, and since then she sent 4,625 messages, almost all of which were about the McCanns.

This year alone she had sent 2,136 tweets and on some days she would send more than 50 messages attacking the McCanns’ behaviour, including their use of public donations and their decision to sue their critics.

When she was confronted by Sky News reporter Martin Brunt about the Twitter messages attacking the couple, Mrs Leyland initially refused to speak but then replied: ‘I’m entitled to do that.’ 

Hate: Speaking before Mrs Leyland's death, Gerry McCann (pictured with wife Kate) said his family had faced 'vile' abuse for seven years and he had 'grave concerns' about letting his twins use the internet unsupervised

Speaking later from her home in Burton Overy, Leicestershire – 15 miles from the McCanns’ home – she said: ‘I regret what I’ve done.’

Still missing: Madeleine McCann vanished in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz in 2007

Her body was found at a Marriott hotel in Leicester on Saturday and police will investigating said officers ‘will look into the circumstances surrounding and prior to her unexpected death’. 

Madeleine McCann, then aged three, went missing in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz in 2007.

Speaking before Mrs Leyland’s death, Mr McCann said his family had faced ‘vile’ abuse for seven years and he had ‘grave concerns’ about letting his twins use the internet unsupervised because of the hate campaign. 

He said he had not seen the comments from Mrs Leyland.

Sky News said in a statement: ‘We were saddened to hear of the death of Brenda Leyland. It would be inappropriate to speculate or comment further at this time.’
