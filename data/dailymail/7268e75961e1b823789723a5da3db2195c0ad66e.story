This is the terrifying moment a driver went the wrong way round a busy roundabout and almost caused an accident.

Dash-cam footage shows a silver Toyota Yaris heading onto the A14 roundabout in Cambridge and going through traffic lights from the wrong side.

The driver then realises the mistake and does a u-turn before another line of cars passes through the traffic lights and heads towards them.

Another driver captured the alarming manoeuvre using a Vicovation Marcus 5 dual dashcam set and uploaded the footage onto YouTube.

The person who took it said: 'I spotted someone going the wrong way around the roundabout.

'I think this is probably a genuine mistake as it seems they tried to rectify it as soon as possible.

'I go around that roundabout often and have often mentioned that the lanes are poorly marked and people have told me they agree that it needs some updating.'

Cambridgeshire police said no action would be taken against the motorist.

A woman had to be cut from her car after a crash in a car park left her teetering on two wheels.

Witnesses say the woman drove her silver Citreon C4 over a bike rack and mounted an empty Vauxhall Insignia, leaving her car elevated off the ground.

Police were called to the incident at 11.28am on Thursday and fire crews cut her out.

She was treated by paramedics at the scene for minor injuries at the Cambridge retail park but no further action was taken.
