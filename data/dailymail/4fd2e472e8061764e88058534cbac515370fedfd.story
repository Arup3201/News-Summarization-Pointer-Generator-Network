Protest: More than 300 consultants have written an open letter to NHS chief executive Simon Stevens

Hundreds of doctors have warned that patients with cancer and heart disease could suffer and die needlessly under new NHS funding plans.

More than 300 consultants and experts have signed an open letter to NHS chief executive Simon Stevens.

Under controversial proposals, hospitals that provide specialist care to more patients than expected will only be reimbursed for half of the cost of each extra case.

Doctors claim the NHS England plan – aimed at diverting cash to long-term disease prevention and making specialist care more cost-effective – will be devastating as the number of cases rises with the UK’s ageing population.

The letter, signed by 345 doctors from centres including Cambridge and London, states that there will ‘inevitably be avoidable deaths as patients die on waiting lists or find that their disease has progressed during the wait for treatment.

‘The clinical consequences of these longer waiting times and a lower quality service to patients with conditions such as heart disease, liver disease, leukaemia, complex cancers etc will be severe.

‘There will inevitably be a significant number of patients suffering unnecessarily, for example by needing more extensive surgery due to their cancer progressing during the wait.’

Lead author Dr David Rosser, medical director of University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, told The Daily Telegraph the ideas were ‘destructive’ and based on a failed strategy to shift services into the community.

He said: ‘This will give hospitals two choices, to not offer treatment to these patients, or to treat them despite the financial loss.

'The negative consequences for the patients of not being offered treatment is obvious.’ 

Dr Rosser added that the proposal was ‘the latest in a long line of punitive measures aimed at hospitals’ and said a similar system in emergency care had left hospitals struggling to provide adequate care.

Consultation on the proposal is due to end today. NHS England declined to comment on the letter last night.
