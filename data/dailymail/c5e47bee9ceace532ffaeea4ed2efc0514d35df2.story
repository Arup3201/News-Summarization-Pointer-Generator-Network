Yohan Cabaye has been told to quit PSG as his slump in form continues.

The former Newcastle United midfielder - who joined the Parisians for £20million in January - is in danger of losing his place in the France side after struggling to make an impact at Parc des Princes.

He is yet to complete a full match in Ligue 1 this season and was hooked after just an hour during the 2-1 win at Lorient at the weekend.

And now France World Cup winner Frank Leboeuf says Cabaye must leave PSG in January if he is to protect his place in the national team ahead of Euro 2016 in their homeland, something which would alert long-time admirer Arsene Wenger at Arsenal.

‘For me, it (move to PSG) is a mistake on his part,’ said the former Chelsea defender.

‘He must think of the France team, he lost the confidence he had stored in Newcastle.

‘I think he has never been part of the first choices of Laurent Blanc (PSG coach). When he arrived, there were already Motta, Verratti and Matuidi.

‘He will have to ask the right questions about his future. He loses confidence. He should think about this in winter or summer. He should be ready for 2016, he is one of the major elements of the France team.’
