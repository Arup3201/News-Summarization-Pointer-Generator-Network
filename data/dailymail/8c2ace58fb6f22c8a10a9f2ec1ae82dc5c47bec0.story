With much fanfare and theatrics, Etihad has unveiled its brand new flagship aircraft, the behemoth Airbus A380, which boasts the world's only penthouse in the sky, and the Boeing B787 Dreamliner. 

Stepping onto the A380 is more like arriving at a chichi business hotel than a plane. Even the galley is like an elegant reception with chocolate brown and champagne-hued décor and ‘food and beverage managers’ looking as if they’re about to go to a ball.

Turning left (something most of us never do on an aircraft) and ascending to the upper deck, one is taken straight to the airline’s piece de resistance: The Residence – a 125-square-foot, three-room private suite, which comes with a Savoy-trained butler and, according to the airline bosses, is already booked up and has had encouraging sales so far.

In addition to a bedroom, The Residence boasts a private ensuite bathroom (pictured) and living room

The living room is suitably glamorous, with gold cushions strewn over a leather-clad sofa; and the shower and bathroom put other airline facilities to shame. Guests will certainly avoid the usual hold-your-nose-and-think-of-England approach needed in most airborne lavatories.

And it’s hard to believe a double bed can fit on a plane, even the gargantuan A380. But there it is, beckoning weary and heavy-walleted travellers into its comfy fold.

But it’s all actually a little smaller than one might imagine, so as well as a seven-figure salary you'll require a relatively trim physique to enjoy it.

The airline declined to comment on who is on the waiting list to fly in The Residence but with the hefty one-way price tag of £12,500 for single or double occupancy, the names Mr and Mrs Beckham spring to mind. Super-rich, celebrities, perhaps even royalty will grace this quite unreal space – a design feat unchallenged by any other airline.

Peter Baumgartner, Chief Commercial Officer of the United Arab Emirates' national airline, said: ‘For a three-room cabin, it’s not overpriced. Effectively it’s four times the price of a first class ticket, so that’s double if you’re travelling in a couple.’

To regain its prestige, The Residence will not be available for upgrade. ‘It would lose its aspirational value,’ said Baumgartner.

The A380 is also the only Etihad aircraft to offer the new First Apartment – a complete living space with reclining lounge chair and an ottoman which opens up to become a separate 80.5-inch fully flat bed.

First class passengers can get total privacy, but if they’re travelling together – or just want to get a little closer to their neighbour – the centre seats can be joined to create a double bed.

In economy, the seats are no bigger with no added legroom, but passengers will benefit from revolutionary new pillows, which split in half to become comfortable travel pillows.

The A380 enters commercial service on December 27 with daily flights between Abu Dhabi and London Heathrow Airport.

Etihad presented its new aircraft during a glitzy event at Abu Dhabi's airport, where 200 members of the press gathered in a hangar draped in black. With a spectacular curtain drop, the A380 was unveiled to the sound of Richard Strauss’ Sprach Zarathustra.

The big event showcased The Residence, Etihad's revamped first class and business suites as well as a slightly tweaked economy cabin, and the carrier’s fancy new livery – a mixture of ‘desert’ inspired browns and beiges and new interiors. 

The unveiling was followed by a fashion show featuring 22 cabin crew, who strutted down a catwalk donning the airline’s brand new uniform.

The airline has replaced its steely grey number with an autumnal, slightly seventies get-up designed by Italian haute couturier, Ettore Bilotta.

Etihad Chief President and Chief Executive Officer, James Hogan, said: ‘As we have done so many times in our short history, we are reshaping the landscape of modern air travel in our own way.

'Today is the culmination of many years of hard work and tremendous endeavour by hundreds of people both in our airline and outside.'

Perfectly suited for the launch of Etihad's new aircraft, the cabin crew showed off their new work attire

Etihad has also revealed a total makeover for its cabin crew, from the classic steely grey skirts and jackets to browns and purples – and most notably, there is no longer a veil attached to female cabin crew’s hats.

Chief Commercial Officer, Peter Baumgartner, told MailOnline Travel: ‘The modern Arabic brand is rooted here, from the patterns in the ceiling inspired but the Louvre, we are very respectful of the local culture.

‘Modern Arabia is what is going on in Abu Dhabi, we are inspired by what’s going on in the rest of the world, but through the lens of the local DNA.

'The new uniform designs are an opportunity for us to differentiate ourselves from other airlines – whether there is a veil or not.’

But the brown is not to everyone’s tastes. One female cabin crew member told Mail Online Travel: ‘I like the purple, it’s more colourful than the old uniform.

‘And the brown goes with the new interiors. But with a cabin crew of 124 different nationalities, it’s not going to suit everyone’

While another admitted: ‘When we saw it on the hanger, we weren’t sure.’

Despite mixed opinions, the crew certainly looked impressive, in keeping with what must be one of the most lavish revamps in the history of air travel.
