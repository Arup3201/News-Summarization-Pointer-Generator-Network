Hull City have failed in an ambitious bid to sign Alexandre Pato on loan.

The 25-year-old Brazil striker has also been offered to Everton in recent days while QPR manager Harry Redknapp said his club could not afford the deal.

Everton have held talks with intermediaries as they look to replace Samuel Eto'o and Hull manager Steve Bruce was eager to tie up a short term loan but Pato's wages of around £60,000 a week are a big hurdle to overcome.

Bruce and his squad are in Portugal at the moment but he is scrambling to find a striker to lift his side away from the relegation zone with injuries mounting.

Pato scored 63 goals in 150 appearances for AC Milan between 2007 and 2012, turning out for the Rossoneri in both Serie A and the Champions League.

He returned to Brazil to join Corinthians at the start of 2013 and is on loan at Sao Paulo.
