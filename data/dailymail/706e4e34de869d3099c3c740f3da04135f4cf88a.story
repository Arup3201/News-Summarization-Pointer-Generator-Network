Ros Altmann said a new law on flexible working hours would allow workers in their 50s and 60s to take time-out for several months 

Millions of workers approaching state pension age could use flexible working laws to demand ‘retirement leave’, the Government’s older people’s tsar has said.

Pensions expert Ros Altmann said this would allow workers to take a sabbatical of several months before returning, possibly part-time.

Three months ago the Government introduced a law which gave all employees the legal right to request flexible working, not just parents and carers.

Employers must consider the request and offer an appeal if it is refused. Crucially, they cannot discriminate based on why employees want to change their hours.

Dr Altmann, the Government’s new Business Champion for Older Workers and the former head of Saga, said many workers in their fifties and sixties would use the law to take time-out for several months to do things such as travel the world or spend more time with family, before coming back ‘refreshed’.

She said the concept of ‘retirement leave’ would hopefully be embraced by employers but, ‘if employers don’t embrace it on their own’, it could potentially become part of legislation in the future.

‘We need to offer flexible working just like we have done for working mothers’, she said.

‘There is no reason we cannot have a concept like maternity leave, a retirement leave, where you take a break before you come back, and then perhaps come back part-time.

‘A lot of people when they look forward to retirement are looking forward to a break, but once they have retired and got the gold watch, it is then very hard to get back into work if you want to.

‘Now, with the request for flexible working extended to everybody there is an opportunity to do that.

‘I would really encourage people to use the law to ask for a period of leave, and for employers to treat the idea seriously, because it could be in their long-term interest as well.’ She said less than ten per cent of the generation coming up for retirement had been to university, let alone taken a gap year, and had worked since school.

‘Maybe they could take a few months out and come back part time having been refreshed,’ she added. ‘At the moment it is all voluntary – you have the right to request although the employer doesn’t have to agree.

‘However, 90 per cent of requests for flexible working have been granted so far.’

She went on: ‘What people think of as the retirement dream is an easier life but that does not, for many people, equate to no work at all – they may not want the same pressure or workload and move to two or three days instead.’

She warned there was 'no reason' why there cannot be a concept of retirement leave, like maternity leave, allowing a person to perhaps go back to work part-time

Dr Altmann said a combination of people living longer and a lack of retirement funds meant that working into your 70s would become the norm in the next five to ten years.

Fathers work harder than men who do not have children, according to an analysis of working lives in the EU.

Men with children who live with them are more than twice as likely to hold down a job than men without families or men living apart from their children.

The rule holds good across Europe according to the study, based on government surveys, by EU statistics arm Eurostat.

Nearly one in three women aged 25 to 54 with children under six were economically inactive last year – without a job and not seeking one – compared to fewer than one in five women without children.

By contrast, only 4.2 per cent of men with one or more children in their household were economically inactive, compared to 9.9 per cent of men without children in their home. 

Financial advisers Hargreaves Lansdown predicted yesterday that the number of over-65s still in the workforce could more than triple from 870,000 in 2010 to three million by 2037, based on factors such as population growth and the rise in state pension age.

By 2037, life expectation in the UK will have risen from 79 to 82 for men and from 84 to 87 for women. Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘Inevitably we’re going to see more people looking to work on into their late sixties and seventies.

‘The challenge for the Government is to make it easier for people to retrain and to find new ways of earning a living. One option would be to look at tax breaks for employers giving training courses to the over-55s.’

Pensions Minister Steve Webb said he did not believe the concept of ‘retirement leave’ would become a legal right, but instead be agreed between workers and employers.

He said: ‘Three out of five requests [across all ages] for flexible working are granted straight away and four out of five after a short time, so I don’t think this is something government needs to prescribe. It works better as a “do-it-yourself retirement leave”.’
