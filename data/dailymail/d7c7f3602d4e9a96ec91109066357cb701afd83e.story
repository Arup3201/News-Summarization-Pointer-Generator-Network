Fears over the ability to contain the spread of the deadly Ebola virus were today heightened as it emerged the body of a teen stowaway was found aboard a U.S. military plane that landed in Germany.

The Pentagon said the boy, believed to be from Mali, was found in a compartment above the rear landing gear of a cargo plane after it touched down at a military base.

Air Force personnel found the boy's body Sunday night after spotting an orange cloth in a small opening by the landing gear during a detailed inspection of the C-130J aircraft when it landed at Ramstein Air Base.

When they tugged on the wet cloth, they discovered it was attached to a boy in the compartment, officials said.

Mysterious: The Pentagon's press secretary, Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby (seen in a July 18 file photo), said the stowaway was a black male who may have been of African origin

Concern:
 Ebola (above) has already killed 672 people in Guinea, Liberia and 
Sierra Leone and infected more than 1,200 since it was first diagnosed 
in February. Symptoms include sudden fever, vomiting and headaches

There is no vaccine or cure for Ebola, which is spread by contact with infected blood or bodily fluids

The Pentagon's press secretary, Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby, said the stowaway was a black male who may have been of African origin.

The plane was on a routine mission in Africa and had made stops in Senegal, Mali, Chad, Tunisia and Naval Air Station Sigonella in Sicily before arriving at Ramstein.

A senior U.S. official said that initial indications suggest that the boy likely climbed aboard in Mali. The official was not authorized to speak publicly about an incident under investigation and requested anonymity.

Mali borders Guinea, the site of the first confirmed case of Ebola during the current outbreak, which has so far killed 672 people, infecting more than 1,200.

Kirby said the body had been turned over to German authorities for autopsy, and the matter is under investigation.

He said the cause of death has not yet been determined, but lab results from samples taken from the body were negative for communicable diseases.

A stowaway aboard a military plane is a significant security breach. No Africa Command senior leaders were on the flight.

'Security is going to be looked at here. Obviously it would be,' Kirby said. 'We try to provide as much security as we can for our aircraft when they're operating in remote locations, and this will all be part of the investigation.'

He added, however, that some of the airfields where the planes land are very remote and the security isn't always up to the standards that are followed in the U.S. and other nations.

Spreading:
 The outbreak has hit Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and has now killed a
 man in far more densely populated Nigeria. The outbreak is the 
deadliest ever of the terrifying disease as the death toll crept past 
670

Symptoms of Ebola include high fever, bleeding, damage to the nervous system and vomiting

Kirby had no details about how 
well-guarded the plane was during the Africa stops and said it was 
unclear how the boy managed to get into the compartment.

'We'll learn what happened here, and if there's corrective action that needs to be taken, we'll take it,' he said.

The
 body was not detected in routine pre-flight and post-flight checks 
during the trip, but was found during a more detailed maintenance 
inspection of the cargo plane, said Kirby.

The
 current Ebola outbreak rampaging through West Africa is the largest in 
history, spreading from Guinea to neighbouring Sierra Leone and Liberia.

On Friday the first confirmed case of Ebola was recorded in the Nigerian capital of Lagos.

Patrick
 Sawyer, a U.S. citizen who had attended his sister's funeral in Liberia
 after she died from the disease, died after travelling into Africa's 
most populous country by air.

Kirby said it is not known when or where the stowaway entered the compartment.

The
 two-day delay in making the incident public was due to the process of 
having to remove the body, do the lab tests and provide official 
notifications to the German government, he said.

The Air Force is doing its own investigation, which will include a review of any potential security lapses.

In
 April, a Somali immigrant survived a flight from San Jose International
 Airport in California to Hawaii stowed away in the wheel well of a 
Boeing 767 commercial airliner.

What is Ebola virus disease?

Ebola is a severe, often fatal illness, with a death rate of up to 90 per cent.The illness affects humans as well as primates, including monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees.

How do people become infected with the virus?

Ebola is transmitted through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals.

In Africa infection in humans has happened as a result of contact with chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines found ill or dead in the rainforest.

Once a person becomes infected, the virus can spread through contact with a sufferer's blood, urine, saliva, stools and semen. A person can also become infected if broken skin comes into contact with a victim's soiled clothing, bed linen or used needles.

Men who have recovered from the disease, can still spread the virus to their partner through their semen for seven weeks after recovery. The Ebola virus is fatal in 90 per cent of cases and there is no vaccine and no known cure.

Ebola is a severe, often fatal illness, with a death rate of up to 90 per cent

Who is most at risk?

Those at risk during an outbreak include:

What are the typical signs and symptoms?

Sudden onset of fever, intense weakness,Â  muscle pain, headache and sore throat. That is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function and internal and external bleeding.

The incubation period is between two and 21 days. A person will become contagious once they start to show symptoms.

When should you seek medical care?

If a person is in an area affected by the outbreak, or has been in contact with a person known or suspected to have Ebola, they should seek medical help immediately.

What is the treatment?

Severely ill patients require intensive supportive care. They need intravenous fluids to rehydrate them.

But there is currently no specific treatment for the disease. Some patients will recover with the appropriate care.

Can Ebola be prevented?

Currently there is no licensed vaccine for Ebola. Several are being tested but are not available for clinical use.

Is it safe to travel to affected areas?

The World Health Organisation reviews the public health situation regularly, and recommends travel or trade restrictions if necessary. The risk of infection for travellers is very low since person-to-person transmission results from direct contact with bodily fluids of victims.Source: World Health Organisation
