Bungling 
pub bosses have irritated locals and history buffs by replacing a pub 
sign for the Duke of York with a picture of the wrong duke.

The
 18th century pub in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, was named in honour of 
Prince Edward, the Duke of York and Albany - the younger brother of 
George III - after he died in 1767.

And
 until a fortnight ago, the pub proudly showed off a picture of the 
correct duke on its pub sign hanging outside the historic alehouse.

How it should look: The old sign on the Duke of York pub shows a picture of  Prince Edward who died in 1767

Wrong sign: It included a picture of Prince Edward who died in 1827, instead of the Duke who died in 1767, right

But
 after a refurbishment, the sign was replaced with an image of Prince 
Frederick, Duke of York and Albany - the second son of George III, who 
died in 1827 marching his troops up a hill – becoming the subject of
 a nursery rhyme.

The pub first opened in around 1770 in memory of Prince Edward, the Duke of York and Albany, after he died in 1767.

Local
 Sam Tredgold, 41, a history graduate, said: ‘The Duke of York is a 
great pub, but why do they keep screwing around with the name?

‘This
 has got to be the most embarrassing of the lot, getting the wrong Duke 
of York and sticking up a daft pub sign showing the Grand Old Duke of 
York leading his men up a hill.

Outrage: Locals aren't happy with the sign which includes an image of the wrong Duke of York

‘Why bother having a pub with so much history if you go and get the very basic historical facts about the pub wrong? 

‘You might as well build a new pub and called it the Prince William, Duke of Cambridge.’

Robert
 Lindley, an ex-regular, said: ‘I think it's pretty lazy of Fuller's to 
have just overturned the pub's history - it's another bit of tradition 
lost in the town.

‘The Duke of York - the correct one - was a colourful character, a ladies' man, and I understand a bit of a lad.’

Former
 landlord Dan Lambert said: ‘The history behind the original name goes 
back to the 18th century during the reign of George III who opened a 
tavern on the Pantiles in remembrance of his brother Edward, the Duke of
 York who had died in Monaco.

'Bit of fun': Fuller's, which bought the pub, said there was no real reason behind the sign change

‘It
 was said that the brothers would frequent establishments on The 
Pantiles during their holiday visits and this was one of their favourite
 venues and therefore the King's choice in opening a respectable tavern 
in his brother's name.’

A
 spokesman for Fuller's, which bought the pub 18 months ago, said: 
‘There is no real reason behind it other than a nice recognisable bit of
 fun.

‘We have been very mindful of maintaining the traditions and history of the pub.

‘We
 aimed to transform the pub in a style that was empathic to the local 
area (and) every change has been approved by local conservation 
officers.

‘The name of the pub has not changed - it will remain the Duke of York.’

It’s not the first time the pub has been in the spotlight for the wrong reasons.

Locals
 kicked up a stink in 1998 when bosses at the Whitbread brewery changed 
its name to Chaplin's - claiming that Charlie Chaplin once visited the 
town.

Pub
 chiefs tore out glass windows with the Duke of York written on them, 
but were ordered to put them back by the council as the building is 
Grade II-listed.
