Christmas came early for two young boys from London after they were cast in Cadbury's first ever festive advert after leaping out on the chocolate firm's filming team wearing purple superhero capes.

Location scouts for the chocolate giant had chosen the boys' houses to be used in filming of the ad, which involved wrapping their entire street in 2,500 metres of purple paper, 60ft of printed tape and giant 18ft bows. 

Jack Boyer and Mark Collett , both eight, from Plumstead, caught the eye of directors when they burst out of their house onto the street clad in capes made from the Cadbury's props.

Young stars: Jack and Mark, both eight, are the stars of the ad and spent the day ripping and unwrapping trees, houses, cars and lampposts - catching the attention of Cadbury, who cast them as the lead children

Merry Christmas! Cadbury have unveiled their first-ever TV ad and we have a first look

Once cast, the boys, who starred alongside 60 other children in the advert, were beside themselves with excitement as they spent the day ripping the glittering paper and unwrapping trees, houses, cars and lampposts.

A spokesman for 
Cadbury Christmas said: 'The boys looked fantastic running around in 
their wrapping paper superhero capes.

'They were having so much fun and we 
knew we had to have them in to show the joy of Christmas. I bet they 
will become future TV stars!'

Speaking
about his foray into TV, Jack said: 'It was the best day of my life. 
All my friends at school want to be in the next ad, especially when I 
told them that I spent the day ripping giant wrapping paper from the 
house.'

Scouted: The boys were selected after location scouts selected their family home as one of the houses to be wrapped from top to bottom in Cadbury wrapping paper

The ad is due to air in the ad break of Coronation Street: a prime time commercial slot that Cadbury believe will make Jack and Mark overnight stars.

Lily concluded: 'It’s an exciting 
time when the Christmas TV ads hit our screens – that’s when people know
the festive season has arrived and the anticipation really starts to 
build.

Cadbury is all about bringing joy and nothing is more joyful than
the build-up to Christmas.'

With
Cadbury launching their biggest Christmas range to date, the Cadbury 
factory Bournville will now be working 24 hours a day, seven days a week
to keep up with the demand of Roses, Advent calendars, selection boxes 
and mousse snowmen that make for popular stocking fillers.

Purple town: For the ad, Cadbury wrapped an entire Plumstead street in 2,500 meters of purple paper, 60ft of printed tape and giant 18ft bows

What a day! The boys said recording the advert was the 'best day of their lives'

Hitting screens: The ad is due to air in the ad break of Coronation Street: a prime time commercial slot

This weekend sees advertisers shell out millions for the prime-time TV slots.

Christmas just wouldn’t be Christmas without mince pies, roast turkey, crackers …and a tear-jerking advert from John Lewis.

The department store has long made it its mission to convert even the most avowed Scrooges, and this year is no exception.

I've got your back: The new John Lewis Christmas advert features a hare and a bear

The
£7million Disney-inspired advert, which makes its TV debut tomorrow, 
tells the story of a selfless hare who is determined to make sure his 
best friend, a bear, doesn’t miss Christmas for once.

Asda will also be launching their Christmas advertising campaign this weekend. During Saturday night’s X Factor, two of the 20 television adverts that Asda has produced will be launched.

M&S had Helena Bonham-Carter and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as the ad's stars

Featuring the strapline – You’re Better off at Asda – the campaign, depicts a number of quintessential seasonal scenarios – from making snowmen to hosting a drinks party.

Boots, who hope to inspire the nation to make all those special someones feel good this Christmas, will air their ad tonight during Coronation Street.

M&S went big this year and called in the likes of David Gandy, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Helena Bonham Carter.
