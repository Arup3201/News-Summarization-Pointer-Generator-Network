Jailed: Driver Alecia Brown crashed her Peugeot car and flipped it 8 feet into the air, instantly killing her friends Donna Morgan, 22, and Faye McKoy, 24

A drunk single mother who killed her two best friends when she ploughed her car 90mph into a motorway gantry has been jailed for 22 months.

Alecia Brown, 24, left two children orphaned when she lost control of her Peugeot and careered 8ft through the air before smashing into the huge steel frame on the M1 motorway.

Her friends, young mum Donna Morgan, 22, and aspiring model Faye McKoy, 24, who was pregnant, were killed instantly in the crash last August.

The friends had enjoyed a night out at
Groove nightclub in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, when Brown decided to 
drive back to their homes in Northampton after drinking a strong 
cocktail.

Leicester Crown 
Court heard that as well as being drunk, Brown was speeding and 
uninsured when she tried to exit the M1 at Junction 15a at 90mph at 3am 
on August 13, last year.

Passengers Faye and Donna were not wearing seatbelts and were killed on impact.Â 

Brown was pulled alive from the mangled wreckage and suffered fractures to her pelvis, femur, spine and skull.

Brown
pleaded guilty to two counts of causing death by dangerous driving and 
was jailed for 22 months for each count to run concurrently.

She was also disqualified from driving for five years.

Judge Philip Head told Brown, who appeared in court on crutches: 'You only had a full licence for just six months.

'Two months before this you took out insurance which was on a dishonest and fraudulent basis, telling lies about yourself and driving record experience.

'It was described as a catastrophic error of judgement that you tried to execute that turn.

'But you were under the influence, travelling very high speeds over some considerable distance which was no error of judgement.'

The court heard a back-calculated blood test found Brown, from Northampton, would have had 115mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood - far over the limit of 80mg.

James Wing, prosecuting, said: 'As she got to the junction at a speed calculated at 90mph, she was on the verge of passing the slip road exit when at the last moment, she made what can only be described as a catastrophic error of judgement.

'She decided she was going to make the turn even though she was going far too fast and had far too little time.

'In attempting to make a turn far too drastic for the speed she was going, the car mounted the ramp, travelled through the air, going at about 8ft above the ground, and smashed directly into a steel gantry.

'Every part of the car was damaged.'

After the case, Donna and Faye's mother's expressed outrage at the 'insultingly low' sentences.

Elaine Morgan, who is now caring for Donna's 20-month old son, Du-Reece, said: 'I was under the impression a sentence was to both prevent re-offending and act as a deterrent.

'I feel neither purpose was served by this insultingly low sentence.

'By handing out only 22 months, the judge is saying Donna and Faye's lives were only worth 11 months apiece and the baby meant nothing, even though the judge stated that this was not simply an error of judgement.

'Needless to say I was devastated with the outcome.'

Faye's mum Sarah York, who is now looking after three-year-old Krystelle, said she had been looking forward to becoming a grandparent again.

She added: 'Almost 12 months have passed and now justice may seem to have been done, but my pain, my grief goes on for life.

'For someone to lose just a mere 22 months of their liberty for being the sole person responsible for taking three innocent lives beggars belief and yet they call it justice.

'But no amount of justice would ever be enough. For at the end of the day it doesn't change anything.

'It does not give me my daughter or grandchild back or Donna back to her family, and so we must go on, feeling empty, betrayed and forever trying to fill a void that can never be filled.

'I will always, with every beat of my heart, mourn the loss of my precious daughter, my best friend, my rock and the grandchild I never got to hold or cherish.'

Adrienne Lucking, mitigating, said: 'As far as the woman in the dock in concerned, she expresses remorse, shame and regret.'
