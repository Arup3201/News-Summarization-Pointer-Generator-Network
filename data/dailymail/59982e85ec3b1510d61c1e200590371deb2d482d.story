A mother has unexpectedly received a letter her son wrote as part of a school project before he was killed in a car crash.

Gail Sharp, from Andersonville, Tennessee, said she was shocked - but ultimately grateful - when the letter addressed to her son, Cameron, arrived in the mail around Mother's Day.

She recognized his handwriting on the envelope, and when she opened it, she discovered a short note that he had written while attending Norris Middle School on May 22, 2007, when he was 12.

Message from the past: Gail and Hubert Sharp, left, were stunned when they received a letter from their son Cameron, right, that was written in 2007. Cameron, 17, was killed in a car crash last year

Surprise mail: 'On this day my brother will graduate from middle school. On the same day, I watched the movie 'Night in the Museum'. My favorite teacher is Mr Cawood,' the short letter read

'Dear Cameron,' it read. 'On this day my brother 
will graduate from middle school. On the same day I watched the movie 
Night at the Museum. My favorite teacher is Mr. Cawood.'

His teacher at the time, Dale Caldwell, explained to WBIR that the letter had been part of a class project in which students wrote letters to their future selves.

They were encouraged to write about their favorite things in life - such as friends or school activities - and write down their life goals.

Mr Caldwell said he would then post the letters to their homes as they were about to graduate high school so that they could reflect on their good times or see whether their goals had changed.

Happy memories: Cameron, pictured, had been encourage to write about this he enjoyed, so he mentioned a film and his favorite teacher. The letters were then to be posted during their month of graduation

Missed: Cameron was a passenger in a car that collided with a truck at an intersection last year

'When I ran across (Cameron's) for just a
 moment I paused and asked myself, "Do I mail this?" But I knew that 
probably it would be really special to his mother,' he told WBIR.

Cameron Sharp was encouraged to write about things that made him happy in the letter, which the teacher would then mail to them in the month of their graduation. His simply read:

'Dear Cameron. On this day my brother 
will graduate from middle school. On the same day I watched the movie 
Night at the Museum. My favorite teacher is Mr. Cawood.'

Gail Sharp said he was right.

'I'm so glad he did,' she said. 'I wasn't looking forward to Mother's Day, and then we got that letter and it did make it special.'

She added that she had always nagged him to practice his handwriting, but now that they had a copy of it, 'it's a treasure to us'.

Her son Cameron would have actually graduated from high school in May 2013, but she doesn't mind that it arrived when it did.

He was just 17 when he was killed in a collision at the interchange of Highway 61 and Highway 441.

He was the passenger in a Ford Escort when it collided with a truck, and he died at the scene. The driver, an 18-year-old fellow Anderson County High School student, survived.

Both the driver and the passenger in the truck were injured.
