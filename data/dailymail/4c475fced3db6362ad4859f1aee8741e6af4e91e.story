A woman who attempted to kill Martin Luther King a decade prior to his death at the hands of James Earl Ray is living at a New York nursing home, it has been claimed.

Izola Curry was 42 when she stabbed King in the chest with a letter opener during his book signing at a New York store.

King came close to death - surgeons told him the tip of the blade was touching his aorta and if he had so much as sneezed he would have drowned in his own blood.

Curry, on the other hand, was arrested and charged with attempted murder.

However, she was deemed unfit to stand trial and was taken to the Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane in New York state.

The Smoking Gun has now claimed to have tracked down 98-year-old Curry to the Hillside Manor nursing home in Jamaica, Queens.

The website reported Curry could not recall the attempted assassination, but referred to the year it occurred and admitted she was placed in a 'hospital for the criminally insane'.

King later referenced the attempted assassination in his final speech 'I've Been to the Mountaintop'.

Following the stabbing, Martin Luther King went on to lead the Civil Rights movement for another 10 years

He said: 'You know, several years ago, I was in New York City autographing the first book that I had written. And while sitting there autographing books, a demented black woman came up. The only question I heard from her was, "Are you Martin Luther King?"

'And I was looking down writing, and I said, "Yes." And the next minute I felt something beating on my chest. Before I knew it I had been stabbed by this demented woman.

'And that blade had gone through, and the X-rays revealed that the tip of the blade was on the edge of my aorta, the main artery. And once that's punctured, your drowned in your own blood -- that's the end of you.'

A psychiatric report completed after her arrest, and published by The Smoking Gun, showed she was convinced the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP) and King were conspiring against her.
