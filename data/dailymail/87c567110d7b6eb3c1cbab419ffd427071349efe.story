A teen convicted of killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend because she dumped him smirked in court on Thursday as the girl's father revealed how he held her in his arms until she died after she was shot five times in the back.

Anthony Ruiz, 17, was convicted of aggravated murder in the deaths of Jennifer Zacarias, 16, and her unborn child.

Wearing orange prison clothes, he smiled as his victim's father Pedro Zacarias recalled how he heard shots fired before finding his little girl lying in the snow in the backyard of their Cleveland home.

'I took my daughter; I took her in my arms. I realized there was too much blood she had been assassinated,' Pedro Zacarias said through an interpreter, according to Fox News.

'Everything became dark.'

The John Marshall High School student was shot multiple times by Ruiz last February, because he was mad she had ended the relationship, Cuyahoga County prosecutors said.

As he made his way to the podium on Thursday, Pedro Zacarias stopped and turned toward Ruiz, saying something to him in Spanish.

The exchange was cut shot when the judge and prosecutors jumped in the middle.

The distraught father later called Ruiz 'a coward' and told him to stop 'that stupid smile.'

Jennifer's mother, Leticia Villafan, clung to her husband as he spoke, tears streaming down her cheeks.

A group of other family members and friends sat in the courtroom wearing bright lime green T-shirts with Jennifer's picture on them.

Zacarias said: 'This person has taken what was most valuable to us. To see him outside, to know that he is alive is more than we can handle.'

Judge Nancy McDonnell sentenced Ruiz to 33 years to life.

Jennifer's parents said they thought the sentence was too light and feared he'd get out while young enough to hurt someone else.

'For me it would be a death penalty, and if possible shoot him,' Zacarias said.

Ruiz also addressed the court and asked the judge to 'have mercy' on him.

He said: 'I was in love and I did make the wrong decision and I apologize for what I've done.'

He also quoted the bible.

'I pray every day that the path he chose isn't to be sent to prison or my purpose in life to be a prisoner,' Ruiz said.
