The incoming New York Times C.E.O Mark Thompson will be grilled within days about his knowledge of the pedophilia scandal engulfing the BBC - the organisation which he was head of for eight years.

An internal investigation run by the BBC is due to report by the end of the month on the decision by the British public broadcaster to pull a planned news report into the long serving television personality Jimmy Saville.

Since his death last year, Saville has been at the centre of countless allegations of sexual abuse towards young women and the internal review will seek to discover if Mr. Thompson knew of the allegations the current affairs program 'Newsnight' was planning to make.

It is not known whether Mr. Thompson will be interviewed by telephone or in person and it is understood that he will be offered legal representation during the course of his questioning.

At the heart of the matter is what Mr. Thompson knew about the planned report and the incoming New York Times chief has already amended his story after recalling a journalist mentioning the allegations against Jimmy Saville at a party.

Mr.Thomson originally said that he was not aware of the sexual abuse allegations that were planned to be made.

While the BBC has maintained it did not have the proof to run the allegations, the organisation will also be examined to see if the information they did have warranted being handed over to the police.

This new development ramps up the pressure on Mr. Thompson with his future employees already questioning his suitability for the top job.

Last month Margaret Sullivan questioned the 
integrity and ability of the man who was director general when a report 
that would have exposed Jimmy Savile as a predator who targeted young, 
vulnerable girls, was axed.

Writing in a blog post yesterday, the public editor, who works on behalf of readers and writes about the newspaper itself said: 'How likely is it that [Thompson] knew nothing?'

'His integrity and decision-making 
are bound to affect The New York Times and its journalism - profoundly. 
It's worth considering now whether he is the right person for the job, 
given this turn of events.'

Jimmy Saville who died in October 2011 is now acknowledged to have been one of the UK's most prolific abusers with over 300 possible victims.

Mr Thompson, who left the BBC after eight years last month, has said he would be happy to give evidence to British politicians investigating the scandal.

He said he only learned about the planned documentary at a party last December when another journalist told him: 'You must be worried about the Newsnight investigation.'

Mr Thompson said he did not ask for any more details, but made informal enquiries from BBC News the next day and was told that the programme had been dropped for 'journalistic reasons'.

He added that he did not ask what allegations against Savile were being investigated, and only found out about them almost a year later after he had stood down from the BBC.

After Savile died, BBC journalists for the Newsnight programme spent six weeks investigating allegations that the presenter abused pupils at a school in Surrey, south-east England.

They spoke to at least four women who claimed they had been abused or knew about abuse at the school, but the programme never aired.

More allegations came to light when a rival British broadcaster, ITV, aired a programme about Savile's behaviour.

British police have received a flood of claims since the ITV documentary was shown, and more than 200 alleged victims have come forward.

In a letter to the Conservative MP Rob Wilson, Mr Thompson described the claims about Savile as ‘exceptionally grave’ but said that the Director-General very rarely became involved in investigations before they were broadcast.

He said: 'Given the many hundreds of investigations the BBC does every year, the personal involvement of the DG (Director-General) in a given investigation would inevitably be unusual and noteworthy and could therefore have a distorting or chilling effect on the journalism involved.’

The Newsnight expose was also not in a list of 'potentially sensitive programmes' drawn up as part of BBC’s editorial policy as far as he could recall, he said.

Mr Thompson added that, during his time as Director-General of the BBC, he never heard any allegations or received any complaints about Savile, adding: ‘His name scarcely came up at all.’

He said he finally heard about the claims when the ITV programme was publicised last month, after he had left the BBC..

This was despite reports about the BBC's decision to drop the Newsnight investigation having previously appeared in five newspapers, including the Daily Mail.
