Police in Australia today warned 
drivers with iPhones not to navigate with Apple Maps after users looking
 for one city found themselves in barren outback more than 40 miles away.

Motorists
 following the much-criticised mapping service to the city of Mildura in
 the country's south-east ended up in the middle of the nearby 
Murray-Sunset National Park.

With
 no nearby water supplies and temperatures in the park reaching as high 
as 46C, police warned the mapping error had the potential to be 
'life-threatening'.

Emu footprints in one of the park's pink salt lakes: Some motorists were stranded for up to 24 hours, police said, and were forced to walk long distances before they were able to call for help

Some
 lost motorists were stranded for up to 24 hours because of the glitch 
and were forced to walk long distances to find phone reception.

Apple's
 problematic map app was launched in September as a rival to Google 
Maps, which had been built in to the company's mobile devices as 
standard since the introduction of the iPhone in 2007.

At it's launch, the service was described by Apple at the time 
as 'the most beautiful, powerful mapping service ever'.

But within 
hours CEO Tim Cook had issued an apology and Apple was recommending 
customers use alternatives.

Langtree Avenue, Mildura: Mildura is a city of 30,000 in north-west Victoria. A major agricultural centre, it is noted for its grape production, supplying 80 per cent of Victoria's grapes

It has been noted that the worst errors in Apple's mapping service were found in areas outside the U.S.

Off the beaten track: Police said they were 
'extremely concerned' by the error, which could direct drivers to outback 40 miles from Mildura

However, this is apparently the first time any public agency has warned that use of the service could be lethal.

In a release, Sergeant Sharon Darcy of
 the Victoria police said: 'Local Police have been called to assist 
distressed motorists who have become stranded within the Murray-Sunset 
National Park after following directions on their Apple iPhone.

'Tests
 on the mapping system by police confirm the mapping systems lists 
Mildura in the middle of the Murray Sunset National Park, approximately 
70km away from the actual location of Mildura.

'Police
 are extremely concerned as there is no water supply within the Park and
 temperatures can reach as high as 46 degrees, making this a potentially
 life threatening issue.

'Some
 of the motorists located by police have been stranded for up to 24 
hours without food or water and have walked long distances through 
dangerous terrain to get phone reception.'

Apple launched the maps service in September after dumping Google's maps in the latest version of its iPhone and iPad software.

Instead, it decided to create its own, 
using partners such as TomTom for data, while also using helicopters and
 planes to create 3D maps of major cities.

A difficult road ahead: Apple's maps were 
slammed for their poor location information and distorted images, 
forcing the company into issuing an apology

However, when the app was released, users discovered thousands of flaws.

This led to outrage among users who flooded Twitter and Facebook with examples of Apple's flawed maps.

Errors noticed by users and tech reviewers included major towns such as Stratford-upon-Avon appearing to be missing, searches for Manchester United Football Club bringing up Sale United - a football club for the over-fives, and large parts of the world obscured by cloud in satellite views.

Apple chief executive has since Tim Cook admitted the company ‘screwed up’ with the new maps service.
