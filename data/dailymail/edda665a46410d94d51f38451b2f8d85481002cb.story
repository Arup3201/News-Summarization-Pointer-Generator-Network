A Georgia teen accused of killing his great-grandmother with a Samurai sword appeared in court for the first time on Wednesday.

Gevin Allen Prince, 15, of Douglasville, was arraigned on charges of malice murder and four counts of aggravated assault.

Prince answered politely when asked by the judge if he understood the charges against him.

Gruesome attack: Gevin Prince, 15, appeared in court for the first time today to face charges in the brutal attack that killed his great-grandmother

Police say the boy stabbed his 77-year-old great-grandmother after he reportedly was told to stop playing a video game.

His grandmother, 55-year-old Laura Prince, is recovering from wounds she suffered on her arm during the same attack.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported he was slapped with the other two assault charges for allegedly chasing two neighbours with the sword.

District Attorney David McDade said those neighbours, both juveniles, were not physically injured.

Mr McDade said: 'They saw what happened. The psychological impact is immeasurable.'

Authorities in Douglasville, Georgia, had to taser the boy in order to arrest him, after he shot at them with a pellet gun during a stand-off.

Crime scene: Police on the lawn of the Douglasville property where the 77-year-old great-grandmother was found stabbed to death

Police said it was the third time in the last three months the teen had been arrested. They had already confiscated another sword off him.

The local sheriffs department responded to a 
call at 5pm on Monday to find the grandmother, in her 50s, barricaded 
inside a room and the great-grandmother lying dead on the ground outside
the home.

Stand-off: Douglas County Sheriff Phil Miller said the boy waved the sword around and shot at police with a pellet gun

Douglas County Sheriff Phil Miller said when deputies arrived at the family's home in the 3400 block of Spring Ridge in Douglasville, the teen was standing in the doorway with a 'full-sized sword' and a pellet rifle.

'He came out with a pellet gun and shot two windows out of a patrol car that was sitting there. He was shooting at us with the pellet gun and swinging the sword around in the air,' said Sheriff Miller.

Deputies showed a lot of restraint and did not shoot the teen, CBS Atlanta reported. Instead, they distracted him with an explosive device.

'It got his attention,' said Sheriff Miller. 'We sent a K-9 unit in and he hit the K-9 dog with the butt of the pellet gun. At thatÂ  point, we tased him then took him into custody.'

History of violence: The 14-year-old had been arrested twice before this year, once having a different sword confiscated

Sheriff Miller said the incident on Monday was the third time this year deputies were called about the teen being violent.

He said: 'We've arrested him on two different occasions. Once in June where he had another sword, which is in evidence. This is not the same sword. He cut his grandmother on the foot with it that time.'

Police arrested him again on July 29.

Neighbour: Pam Mayercik, who lives across the street, said the boy would wave at her but seemed a little different

'We almost had to hog tie him to not hurt him,' said Sheriff Miller, adding that each time deputies arrested the teen, they took him to the hospital for evaluations and doctors released him.

'Obviously he was a danger to himself, a danger to his family and a danger to this community,' said Sheriff Miller.

Pam Mayercik lives across the street from the family. She told CBS Atlanta she often saw the teen in the neighbourhood.

'I used to wave to the kid all the time,' she said. 'He seemed like he was a little bit different. He's just a little kid with glasses and kind of shy.'
