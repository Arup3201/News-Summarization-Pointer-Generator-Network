It will go down in history as one of the most glamorous celebrity weddings of all time.

But the honeymoon is over for Amal  Clooney who jetted out to Greece today to advise the country’s government on how best to persuade Britain to return the Elgin Marbles.

Dressed in a simple white cardigan and khaki trousers, the new Mrs Clooney was spotted chatting happily to British Airways staff at the check-in gates at London's Heathrow airport. She later landed in Athens to a flurry of media attention.

The 36-year-old, and her boss, Geoffrey Robertson QC, of London’s Doughty Street chambers, will hold a series of meetings with government officials during their stay, relating to the return of the Parthenon sculptures that are presently on display in the British Museum.

Center of attention: It comes two weeks after the 36-year-old married George Clooney in a lavish wedding in Venice, Italy, on September 27, which reportedly cost around £8million

It comes two weeks after Mrs Clooney married actor George Clooney in a lavish wedding in Venice, Italy, on September 27, which reportedly cost around £8million.

Since the ceremony, the human rights laywer has changed her professional name to Amal Clooney - losing her maiden name - according to a listing on the website of Doughty Street chambers.

It reads: 'Amal Clooney is a barrister specialising in international law, extradition and criminal law.' 

Mrs Clooney's choice of the Greece trip as her first official duty after her honeymoon was perhaps a wedding present to her husband who, earlier this year, waded into the centuries-old dispute over the Elgin Marbles, favouring the Greek side.

The 7th Earl of Elgin, Thomas Bruce, removed the Parthenon Marble sculptures from the Acropolis in Athens while serving as the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1799 to 1803.

The relics, known as the Elgin Marbles, are sculptures mostly by Phidias and his assistants.

Recently married: Fluent in French and Arabic, Lebanese-born Mrs Clooney is a barrister specialising in international law, human rights, extradition and criminal law

Statement: Mrs Clooney has represented clients in cases before the International Criminal Court, the International Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights, as well as in domestic courts in the UK

In good spirits: Mrs Clooney is pictured smiling as she arrives at the Hotel Grande Bretagne in central Athens

In 1801, the Earl claimed to have obtained a permit from the Ottoman authorities to remove pieces from the Parthenon and his agents removed half of the surviving sculptures, as well as architectural members and sculpture from the Propylaea and Erechtheum.

They were shipped to Britain, but in Greece, the Scots aristocrat was accused of looting. They were bought by the British Government and are still on display in the British Museum.

Greece has sought their return from the British Museum through the years, to no avail.

In February, while attending the Berlin Film Festival to promote The Monuments Men, Mr Clooney was asked by a Greek journalist whether Britain should allow Greece to reclaim its historic art.

Press attention: The human rights lawyer attracted a lot of attention from the media as she landed in Athens

He replied: ‘You have a very good case. Maybe it wouldn’t be a bad thing if they were returned. That is a good idea, a fair thing to do.’

The Hollywood star’s involvement in the debate was not entirely welcomed. 

John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons culture, media and sport committee, said: ‘I suspect George Clooney doesn’t know the history of the Elgin Marbles and the legal entitlement Britain has to them.’

And a British Museum spokesman said at the time that trustees ‘feel there is a public benefit to having the sculptures in our collection remain part of our collection’.

Greece says it is no longer an issue of ownership and that it would accept them back as a permanent loan, but the museum said the Greek government would first have to relinquish its claim to them.

The svelte beauty, who attracted the attention of passengers at the airport, caught a three and a half hour flight to Athens to advise the Greek government about the scupltures. 

Doughty Street chambers yesterday confirmed Mrs Clooney had travelled to Athens, where she will remain until Thursday, at the invitation of the Greek government ‘in connection with the Parthenon sculptures that are presently on display in the British museum’. 

A statement said: ‘Mr Robertson and Mrs Clooney were first asked to provide legal advice to the Greek government on this matter in 2011.

Culture: Elgin Marbles at the British Museum. The relics are sculptures mostly by Phidias and his assistants

History: It was the 7th Earl of Elgin, Thomas Bruce, who removed the Parthenon Marble sculptures from the Acropolis in Athens while serving as the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1799 to 1803 

‘They will be holding a series of meetings with government officials during their stay, including the Prime Minister, Mr Antonis Samaras, and the Minister of Culture, Mr Konstantinos Tasoulas.’

Fluent in French and Arabic, Lebanese-born Mrs Clooney is a barrister specialising in international law, human rights, extradition and criminal law.

She has represented clients in cases before the International Criminal Court, the International Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights, as well as in domestic courts in the UK and US.

More than 100 guests - including Hollywood stars Matt Damon and Sandra Bullock - flew to Venice to see her get married in a stunning custom-made Oscar de la Renta dress. 

They began arriving by chauffeur-driven taxi boats for the nuptials shortly before 6.30pm on the day, with Damon the first to arrive. 

Wave after wave of guests were ferried to the waterfront entrance of the exclusive hotel over a period of 20 mins, which culminated in Mr Clooney's arrival just before 7pm as the sun was setting.

Other celebrities in attendance included Emily Blunt, Vogue editor Anna Wintour, Cindy Crawford and her husband Rande Gerber, and John Krasinski. 

After the celebrations, it is understood the bride and groom jetted off to Marrakech for their honeymoon. 

Last weekend, it was reported that Mr and Mrs Clooney splashed out £10million on a sprawling Grade II-listed manor house in Berkshire.

The Elgin Marbles are a collection of classical Greek marble sculptures, inscriptions and architectural members that were mostly created by Phidias and his assistants.

The 7th Earl of Elgin, Thomas Bruce,  removed the Parthenon Marble pieces from the Acropolis in Athens while serving as the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1799 to 1803.

In 1801, the Earl claimed to have obtained a permit from the Ottoman authorities to remove pieces from the Parthenon.

As the Acropolis was still an Ottoman military fort, Elgin required permission to enter the site. 

His agents subsequently removed half of the surviving sculptures, as well as architectural members and sculpture from the Propylaea and Erechtheum.

The excavation and removal was completed in 1812 at a personal cost of around £70,000.

The scupltures were shipped to Britain, but in Greece, the Scots aristocrat was accused of looting and vandalism.

They were bought by the British Government in 1816 and placed in the British Museum.

They still stand on view in the purpose-built Duveen Gallery.

 Greece has sought their return from the British Museum through the years, to no avail.

In February, while attending the Berlin Film Festival to promote The Monuments Men, George Clooney was asked by a Greek journalist whether Britain should allow Greece to reclaim its historic art.

He replied: ‘You have a very good case. Maybe it wouldn’t be a bad thing if they were returned. That is a good idea, a fair thing to do.’

Amal Alamuddin Clooney's law firm Doughty Street chambers yesterday confirmed that she had travelled to Athens, where she will remain until Thursday, at the invitation of the Greek government.

Her visit is ‘in connection with the Parthenon sculptures that are presently on display in the British museum’, it said.

The authenticity of Elgin's permit to remove the sculptures from the Parthenon has been widely disputed, especially as the original document has been lost. Many claim it was not legal.

However, others argue that since the Ottomans had controlled Athens since 1460, their claims to the artefacts were legal and recognizable.
