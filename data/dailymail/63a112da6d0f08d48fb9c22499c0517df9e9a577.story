A three-year-old boy has died after suffering a heart attack at London Bridge train station.

The boy collapsed and went into cardiac arrest on a station platform at around 9.15pm yesterday.

The child's mother screamed in horror as passers-by tried to resuscitate him until paramedics arrived, but he was later pronounced dead at St Thomas' hospital.

Passengers watched in horror as commuters tried to resuscitate the child.

PR manager Melanie Hutchinson's view was obstructed by another train, but could hear the child’s mother screaming.

'I could hear screams of real pain, harrowing. I wondered if someone was in labour it was so intense.

'I was looking at the people on the stationary train. Everyone who was there was facing the scene. I don’t think anyone knew what to do or what was going on.

'The tannoy asked for any nurse or doctor to go to platform 5. The train in front never moved so I didn’t see anything. But those screams will haunt me.' 

Fellow commuter John Reid, 41, from Bromley, south London said : 'I saw the paramedics working like Trojans to try to save the child. I felt so helpless and feel so sorry for those poor parents.' 

Filmmaker Joe Richardson tweeted: 'Praying for the young child who collapsed at London Bridge and the mother. So surreal.'

A London Ambulance Service spokeswoman said: 'We were called at just before 9.15pm to reports of child in cardiac arrest at London Bridge train station. 

'The first of our medics arrived within three minutes of the call coming into our control room.

'CPR was already being carried out by a passer-by on arrival. Medics made every effort to resuscitate the patient both at the scene and on the way to hospital. He was taken as a priority to St Thomas’.' 

A spokesman for British Transport Police said: 'We were called to London Bridge station shortly after 9pm on Wednesday, 15 October to reports of a child having collapsed.

'Colleagues from London Ambulance Service also attended. The boy, believed to be three years-old, was taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

'The incident is not being treated as suspicious. A file will be prepared for the coroner.'
