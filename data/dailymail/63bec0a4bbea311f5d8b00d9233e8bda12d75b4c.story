A Green Party-controlled local authority has been accused of plotting a 'backdoor mansion tax' which would see owners of homes worth £2million or more paying over £9,000 a year in rates.

Brighton council is said to be the first council in the country to explore the idea of a 'progressive council tax'.

The system, which is being opposed by both the town's Labour and Tory councillors, would lead to a 'steep increase' in the amount billed to each of the city's 120,000 households.

The Green Party-controlled local authority are considering introducing a 'progressive council tax' that would see wealthy homeowners paying over £9,000 in rates

However, supporters claim only the richest 20 per cent would end up paying the hike as four-fifths of homes would be eligible for a discount.

They argue it would be a fairer way of raising revenue as the Government cuts town hall budgets by millions of pounds every year.

However, critics slammed the idea as 'dangerous' and 'unworkable', adding it could see the richest pay up to 200 per cent more in council tax every year.

Council leader Jason Kitcat said: 'It's really refreshing to see party members coming up with ideas which seek to minimise the draconian cuts being handed down by this coalition Government which have been adding further to the problems heaped on our city by Westminster.

Owners of some of Brighton's most expensive properties such as these Grade I listed Regency terraces close to the seafront would faces council tax increases of 200%

'No other party in the city seems even interested in tackling austerity.'

Currently
the Government has placed a cap of 2 per cent on any annual increase in
council tax. Any rise above that can only be introduced after an 
area-wide referendum.

If 
approved, 80 per cent of city residents would be eligible for a 
reduction which would be "means-tested", based on residents' income and 
ability to pay.

Advocates claim a majority of households would end up paying less than they currently do.

According
to a Green member, 'the higher the increase, the less the majority will
pay'. Exact details and costs of the scheme are now being looked at by 
Green Party members.

But a briefing sheet produced for Labour Party members claimed increases of 200 per cent would be needed to pay for administration costs and ensure enough money was raised to limit the impact of Government cuts.

If this figure was applied, it means those in band H - the highest council tax category - would see their annual rates increase from £3,014.56 to £9,043.68.

Labour councillor Gill Mitchell said: 'This sounds like another crackpot scheme being dreamt up by the Greens where they decide who is worthy of a council tax reduction and they decide who should pay more.

'It sounds dangerous and we would be against it.'

Conservative councillor Ann Norman, who said the system sounded like a 'backdoor mansion tax'.

She said: 'I just cannot see how it would work. I think we need to keep at the lowest level of council tax we can.

'As a party we normally try and go for a freeze unless there is some near catastrophe.'

A Green Party spokesman said the idea was one of 'many avenues' members in the Brighton and Hove were exploring to 'minimise the effects of Government cuts on the city's residents".

He added council officers would not spend any time helping to draw up the plans although they may be asked for information already in the public domain to help develop the idea.

The spokesman said a decision on whether it is taken forward will be taken in the coming months.
