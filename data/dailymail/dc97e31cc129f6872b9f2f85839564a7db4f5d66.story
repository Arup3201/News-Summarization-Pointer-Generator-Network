Police are launching a crackdown on domestic abusers during the World Cup after research showed it sends violence soaring - even when England wins.

Forces across Britain are drafting in extra resources, launching hard-hitting poster campaigns and even paying personal visits to known offenders.

It comes 
after a study showed domestic incidents increase by more than a third 
when England loses a World Cup match - but also rise by 26 per cent when
 the team wins.

In Essex 117 fans, seven of them 
women, will reportedly be handed warnings after officers analysed their 
history of domestic and footballing crime.

A similar tactic is being employed in Northumbria, where officers warn they will be paying 'special attention' to people who are known to be a risk.

Elsewhere posters in single-sex toilets and on bus stops will depict distraught women next to slogans including 'Leave the striking to the players' and 'What time is kick off in your house?'

It comes after a report found a steep increase in domestic violence during the tournament.

Researchers from Lancaster University examined crime figures from Lancashire Police during the 2002, 2006 and 2010 World Cups and found there was more violence on days when England played.

In Surrey the increase was far more dramatic - with a 61 per cent leap in domestic violence reports on the day England drew 0-0 with Algeria in South Africa four years ago.

Despite rising awareness, abuse has got worse since 2002.

The
 Lancaster University study, published in September in the Journal of 
Research in Crime and Delinquency, found the number of reports on match 
days rose from 64 in 2002 to 99 in 2010.

The
 study's authors, Dr Stuart Kirby and Professor Brian Francis wrote: 
'Although it is difficult to say the tournament is a causal factor, the 
prestigious tournament does concentrate the risk factors into a short 
and volatile period, thereby intensifying the concepts of masculinity, 
rivalry and aggression.'

Lancashire Police Commissioner Clive Grunshaw said heavy drinking was often to blame

Several police forces have launched World Cup domestic violence campaigns today.

Essex Police will pay personal visits to 117 fans known to be a risk, The Guardian reported.

In Lancashire the football clubs Preston North End, Blackpool, Blackburn Rovers and Burnley have joined emergency services to launch a hard-hitting poster campaign.

In 
Hampshire, volunteers will accompany police on domestic violence calls 
to discuss the victim's relationship history and look for ways to 
escape.

And in Northumbria, officers specialising in domestic violence cases will be on duty during the matches.

Lancashire Police and Crime Commissioner Clive Grunshaw said: 'Residents across the county will be coming together to watch the World Cup this summer, and it should be a time for fun and celebration.

'But unfortunately, experience tells us the tournament is also likely to be a time for excessive drinking â€“ which can have devastating consequences.'

Northumbria Police and Crime Commissioner Vera Baird added: 'It is well known that there's a tendency for incidents of domestic violence to increase during high profile sporting events, particularly as more alcohol is consumed.

'High risk domestic violence offenders and those with links to football violence have been identified across the force area and officers will be paying special attention to them.'

She added: 'It's important that we use these high profile events to raise this issue again, ensuring people generally know that this crime continues to happen even when most people seem to be happy and enjoying themselves.

The tournament begins on Thursday in Brazil, with England's first match against Italy this Saturday in the Amazon rainforest city of Manaus.
