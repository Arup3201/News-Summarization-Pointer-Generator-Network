Rocker Jon Bon Jovi is part of a Toronto group that has submitted paperwork expressing interest in buying the Buffalo Bills.

It is unclear if the group would eventually want to move the NFL team to Toronto, but the franchise is on the market after Hall of Fame owner Ralph Wilson died in March.

An Associated Press source confirmed that Bon Jovi discussed his interests during a restaurant meeting last month with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.

The Bills most recently were valued by Forbes at $870million. They are projected to be sold for at least $1billion, partly because NFL teams rarely go on the market.

The team is essentially locked into playing at Ralph Wilson Stadium through the 2019 season because of a strict nonrelocation clause included in a 10-year lease agreement reached with the state and county in December 2012.

The Bills would incur a $400m penalty by even broaching the prospect of moving during the lease’s term. There is a one-time exception that would allow the Bills to break the lease for just under $28.4m in 2020.

The group also includes Larry Tanenbaum and the Rogers family. Tanenbaum is chairman of Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, which controls the NHL’s Maple Leafs and NBA’s Raptors. The Rogers family includes Edward Rogers, who is deputy chairman of Rogers, the Toronto communications giant.

The group is on a list of prospective buyers who have submitted a nondisclosure agreement form to Morgan Stanley, the banking firm overseeing the Bills sale. The Toronto group has retained the Goldman Sachs banking firm to assist in the bid.

Bon Jovi previously expressed interest in owning an NFL franchise but never specifically mentioned the Bills. This is the first real indication linking him to Tanenbaum and Rogers.
