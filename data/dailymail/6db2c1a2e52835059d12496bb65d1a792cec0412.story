If you were wondering what the prototype of a Louis van Gaal player is you need not do so any longer. It is Ashley Young.

The versatile winger-turned-wing-back, who netted the winner in United's 1-0 victory at Newcastle United on Wednesday, is the Dutchman's kind of guy.

'He is a player who wants to perform what you say,' Van Gaal told MUTV. 'I think he fits good in my profile.'

Ashley Young celebrates his goal against Newcastle United, and he is a favourite of manager Louis van Gaal

Manager Van Gaal has been frequently picking Young, and United have lost just once with him in the side

So there you have it. Not Wayne Rooney, not Robin van Persie, not even £60million man Angel Di Maria.

Ashley Young.

The news may not go down well with legions of United fans who have spent the best part of a season doing their best Alan Turing impressions and trying to decipher Van Gaal's fabled philosophy.

That Young, who has often flattered to deceive, is a cornerstone of Van Gaal's style may puzzle even further. The statistics, however, tell a different story.

Aside from defeat in their home opener against Swansea, United have not lost with Young in the side.

At St James' Park, albeit from a chance laid on a plate, he scored United's late winner for all three points

In the 17 matches he has been involved in since they have won 11 and drawn six.

At St James' Park, albeit from a chance laid on a plate by the generous hosts, he scored United's first late winner since Boxing Day 2012.

Under Van Gaal, Young appears to have recreated himself.

His form at both wing-back and in his traditional slot further up the field is expected to win him a new contract and the Dutchman heaped further praise on the former Aston Villa man.

'We have played also with wing-backs and I think that is his best position,' said Van Gaal.

'Now I use him as a winger and he does a very good job. I am pleased with him.'

This season has seen Young as a regular at Old Trafford, playing both on the wing and at wing back

Personality-wise, Young is also a good fit for Van Gaal. He is known as one of the most down-to-earth players at the club and in 2013 responded to an appeal on behalf of a terminally ill United fan to fulfil his wish of seeing his beloved Reds for the final time by handing over his box at Old Trafford.

Such gestures are not lost on Van Gaal, who regularly encourages his men to engage with fans.

Meanwhile, Jonny Evans is considering entering a not guilty plea after the FA charged him with spitting at Newcastle's Papiss Cisse, who has already accepted the same charge.

The Northern Ireland man maintains that he spat at the floor, not at Cisse, and the club are set to give him their backing.

He has until 6pm to respond to the charge.
