As GOP figures come out to lambast Newt Gingrich's bid for presidency, the latest polls show Mitt Romney is bounding ahead of him in the polls - and looks set for a decisive victory in Floria.

The former governor of Massachusetts leads by a staggering 15 points - 42 per cent compared to Gingrich's 27 per cent. Rick Santorum is third with 16 per cent, while Ron Paul trails with 11 per cent.

'The bottom line in all this is Romney's sitting in the driver's seat going into Tuesday,' said Lee Miringoff, from the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, which conducted the poll with NBC.

Campaign trail: Romney (standing centre) rides his campaign bus from Naples to Hialeah, Florida today, with (from L-R) aide Charlie Pearce; adviser Eric Fehrnstrom; wife Ann Romney; adviser Beth Myers; Sheri Romney and brother Scott Romney

Showing support: Sen John McCain said that Mitt Romney should go to the White House and Newt Gingrich should go to the moon

Supporters: But there has been some good news for Gingrich, with less conventional Republican figures such as Herman Cain, left, and Chuck Norris announcing the are endorsing the former Speaker of the House

It comes as yet another blow to Gingrich, who has been slated by GOP heavy-weights, including John McCain and Glenn Beck, in recent days.

However, there was one piece of good 
news for the embattled presidential hopeful, as he received the endorsement of 
maverick former candidate Herman Cain.

Pizza magnate Cain, who quit the race
following allegations that he had sexually harassed several employees,
threw his support behind Gingrich at a GOP fundraising event.

'I
hereby officially and enthusiastically endorse Newt Gingrich for 
president of the United States,' he said. 'I know he is going through 
this sausage-grinder because he cares about the future of the United 
States of America.'

In
return, Gingrich told the crowd that he intended to appoint Cain to a 
taskforce dealing with 'jobs, economic growth and taxes' if he becomes 
President.

The endorsement 
comes as something of a surprise, given that Cain has already aimed to 
be endorsing 'the people' - but out of the remaining candidates, it is 
Gingrich who is closest to Cain's brand of conservative populism.

Clash of the Titans: When asked if he thought 
Newt Gingrich (left) had a shot at the White House, Sen Bob Dole (right)
said: 'I hope not'

The endorsement offers some relief for Gingrich, who has come under fire from top GOP figures.

Everyone from former 
presidential candidates John McCain and Bob Dole to Fox News pundit 
Glenn Beck were of the opinion that Gingrich is not the right man for 
the presidency.

Former presidential candidate John McCain told reporters: ‘(Just) because someone debates well does not mean necessarily they would be a good president.’

He added: ‘I think we ought to send Newt Gingrich to the moon and Mitt Romney to the White House.’

Last Thursday, Bob Dole said in an interview that he hoped Gingrich doesn’t have a chance to become president.

Sen.
Dole also wrote in an open letter released by the Romney campaign that 
he thinks Gingrich is a ‘one-man-band’ who would ‘have an adverse impact
on Republican candidates running for country, state, and federal 
offices.’

Outspoken: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, left, called Gingrich an ‘embarrassment to the Republican party’ while Glenn Beck, right, said he ‘makes Nancy Pelosi look like a superstar’

Grandson of a president: Harrison Tyler, the 84-year-old son of President John Tyler, said that Gingrich is a 'big jerk'

On Meet the Press, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie called Gingrich ‘an embarrassment to the Republican Party.’

He said the former speaker simply 
does not have the experience necessary to run the Oval Office. ‘He’ll 
never run anything,’ Gov. Christie said.

The latest poll of Florida voters, taken by NBC and Marist, indicates Romney is on the road to an easy victory in the crucial state:

Mitt Romney 42 per cent 

Newt Gingrich 27 per cent

Rick Santorum 16 per cent

Ron Paul 11 per cent

Undecided 4 per cent

The famously outspoken conservative 
news pundit Glenn Beck was not shy about his feelings toward Gingrich, 
calling him ‘the only candidate I cannot vote for.’

He also stated: ‘He makes Nancy Pelosi look like a superstar to the rest of the country.’

Even the grandson of tenth president 
John Tyler had negative things to say about him. In an interview with 
Politico, 84-year-old Harrison Tyler said Gingrich is 'a big jerk,' in 
part due to his three marriages.

'He needs to stick with the same wife, that's what my mother taught me,' Mr Tyler said.

But Gingrich, even as his numbers 
fall, has supporters in high places. Walker, Texas Ranger star Chuck 
Norris wrote a gushing endorsement for Gingrich, calling him ‘the best 
man left on the battlefield who is able to outwit, outplay and outlast 
Obama and his campaign machine.’

In
the column, written a day after the South Carolina primary, Norris also
said: ‘Rome is burning, and we need to appoint the best firemen 
possible to rush in and put out her fury.’

Looking good: Mitt Romney's poll numbers look promising. He held a campaign rally at Eastern Ship Building in Panama City, Florida today

According to the Roll Call endorsement 
tracker, Romney has the most major endorsements of the Republican 
candidates, with 73 House members behind him. Gingrich, on the other 
hand, only has 11 House endorsements. Ron Paul and Rick Santorum each have three, ABC News reports.

The latest NBC poll shows Romney ahead of the rest of the field across many subgroups, including those who are liberal or moderate (49 per cent), make more than $75,000 a year (49 per cent), identify as 'conservative' (47 percent), and, in particular with women.

Women said they preferred Romney by 47-26 per cent over Gingrich. Romney also leads with men at 38-29 per cent.

Gingrich needs a Florida win to 
solidify the frontrunner mantle he took on after his resounding victory 
in the third nominating contests.

'If we win Florida, I will be the nominee,' Gingrich declared at a golf facility in Port St. Lucie.

But in a simple ad titled 'History Lesson' 
-- a play on Gingrich's background as a historian -- Romney's campaign 
showed footage of an NBC television anchor's news report the day 
Democrats and Republicans found him guilty of ethics violations in 1997.

'Newt Gingrich, who came to power, after all, preaching a higher standard in American politics, a man who brought down another Speaker on ethics accusations, tonight he has on his own record the judgment of his peers, Democrat and Republican alike,' anchor Tom Brokaw says in the report, which makes up the entire ad. Gingrich denies wrongdoing.
