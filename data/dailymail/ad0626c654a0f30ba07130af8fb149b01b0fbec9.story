There is never really a good time to watch porn at work, no matter how empty you think the office is.

But even when you've checked every meeting room, toilet cubicle and the office kitchen to ensure the coast is clear, it is always a good idea to close the blinds.

That is what one lonesome worker in Australia learned when he was caught red handed pouring over a graphic X-rated video at his desk - by office employees across the street.

Smutting his stuff: Despite their applause and calls of encouragement, the white-shirted worker bashfully turned off his computer and vanished into a darker corner of his office where he could no longer be seen

The picture was taken by Twitter user James P in 
Brisbane who posted it on the social networking site for the world to see. It immediately went viral.

Lounging in his swivel chair, the unidentified voyeur continued watching the flick, blissfully unaware that he was giving the building opposite a peep show of its very own.

But his alone-time was frustratingly cut short when he noticed the gathering crowd of workers at the window behind him.

Despite their applause and calls of 
encouragement, the white-shirted worker bashfully turned off his 
computer and vanished into a darker corner of his office where he could 
no longer be seen.

James P,
 who posted it under the Twitter handle PenguinShepherd, said on the 
site that it was not the man's first time, noting that he had been 
'doing it for ages'.

He later tweeted: 'He saw us all watching him towards the end of the day. We gave him a round of applause, he closed his screen down...'

It is not the first time an employee has exposed their predilection for the adult arts to public scrutiny.

In December a high school teacher became an internet sensation after he hooked up his laptop to a projector screen in a lecture hall, apparently unaware of the Pornhub.com account notification email sitting at the top of his inbox.

As titters rippled through the auditorium, one enterprising student took a picture of the screen and posted it online, thus compounding the teacher's already widespread humiliation.

Healthy desk life? In November last year, German sex therapist Dr Christoph Ahlers told a conference on medicine and therapies for the treatment of sexual behavioural issues that as much as two thirds of the world's office workers have watched porn from their desks.

In November last year, an expert claimed that as much as two thirds of the world's office workers have watched porn from their desks.

German sex therapist Dr Christoph Ahlers said around 60 million people log on to the world's largest free porn website every
 day.

made the claim at a conference in Salzburg, Austria, on medicine and therapies for the treatment of sexual behavioural issues.

'Modern
 viewing of porn is no longer something in which strange individuals are
 engaged in in quiet rooms in video booths,' he said.

'Sixty million views, of which two 
thirds are people sitting at their computer at work, is a powerful 
indicator of what is happening.'

Dr Ahlers said watching porn was now a 'worldwide phenomenon'.

He added that a second rush to the X-rated website occurred after dark.

'The second peak is from viewers at home after midnight,' he said at the conference.
