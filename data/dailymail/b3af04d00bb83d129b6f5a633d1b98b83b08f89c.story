The family of an Indianapolis woman who died from inhaling excessive smoke from fireworks at a World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) event five years ago are battling for justice and suing those they claim are responsible.

Susan Prim, 36, a nurse, took her sons, Brodie and Tyler, to a WWE Summer Slam match on August 17, 2008, held at the Conseco Fieldhouse arena in Indiana.

During the show's finale, featuring 
the professional wrestler known as The Undertaker - whose signature move is the 'choke slam' - fireworks shot out around the arena.

Susan Prim, 36, died from severe brain damage after her asthma attack, says husband, David

The thick smoke from the fireworks engulfed the venue causing Susan 
to suddenly have a fatal asthma attack, claim the Prims. 

'She was telling us she was having trouble breathing, she wasn’t feeling too well and so we walked out. She collapsed, she was passed out,' Brodie tells RTV6 ABC as he recounts the tragic event.

‘She had been down too long without 
oxygen and she had no brain activity. They had her on life support but 
they told me she was already gone,’ Brodie says.

Susan’s
 brain damage was 'so severe' that she went from respiratory arrest to 
cardiac arrest and never recovered, according to David Prim, Susan's 
husband.

The Prims blame the WWE Inc. and the 
city of Indianapolis, among others, for not making the show safe enough,
 causing Susan's death.

The Prims filed a lawsuit against each 
group they said was responsible for making sure the show was safe, 
including the Capital Improvement Board, Pacers Basketball, LLC, Conseco
 Fieldhouse, World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc., various other 
pyrotechnic and entertainment companies and the city of Indianapolis.

Always there: Brodie Prim says his mother, Susan, was his 'best friend'

This week, on July 2, the Indiana Court of Appeals accepted the list of defendants, which means the case can move forward.

None of the defendants would comment on the pending case.

The WWE, which is the largest 
wrestling federation the world, reaches 13 million viewers in the U.S 
and is broadcasted in more than 145 countries.

Brodie, who tells RTV6 ABC that he misses his mother, hopes this small, but significant, victory will give Susan the justice she deserves.

‘She was always there for me, helped me out. She was my best friend.’
