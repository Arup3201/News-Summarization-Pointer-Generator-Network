Mothers are paying up to four times the recommended price for formula milk after two popular brands sold out in shops last month.

Cow & Gate Comfort and Aptamil Comfort are marketed for babies who show signs of colic or constipation.

Some infants have become hungry and distressed since the shortage began, leading parents to take desperate measures.

In demand: Cow & Gate and Aptamil are marketed for babies who show signs of colic or constipation - which means they are seen as rare by desperate parents

Costly: Parents have been willing to pay over the odds to get hold of some of the formula milk on eBay. These three 900g tubs of Aptamil Comfort were going for £82, but still had 12 hours and 30 minutes left

Bidding war: This tub of Cow & Gate Comfort formula milk was going for £63, but bidders still had 35 minutes to increase their offers

On eBay, one lot of three of the 900g tubs – officially priced at £10.99 each – had yesterday attracted 23 bids and was being sold for £100 plus £8 postage.

Babies raised on a particular formula are often extremely reluctant to switch to a new product or brand because they reject the taste and consistency.

As a result, feeding – which can often already be extremely stressful for parents – may become even more difficult.

One mother, Catherine Russell, from Cheshire, said that she had resorted to feeding her 11-month-old daughter Hattie with a replacement formula when she had fallen asleep. The 31-year-old mother of three said: ‘This is an absolute nightmare. Parents had no warning that there was a problem.’

Both Aptamil and Cow & Gate are owned by French firm Danone, who say that the shortage is due to problems in the supply of a crucial ingredient, maize starch, which is used to thicken the milk.

Mrs Russell said: ‘My daughter has a slight lactose intolerance, which means I can’t put her on other types of formula. I tried alternative products and brands, but she just refuses to drink milk now.

‘I have had to take to feeding her while she is asleep, because that is the only way she will take it.

‘I feel very let down by the company. You can’t bring out these products only for them to suddenly disappear off the shelves, especially when you are dealing with the health of new born babies.’

The shortage has sparked an outcry on parenting websites.

On the Netmums website, one mother said that she had called more than 100 outlets in her search for the products.

Another wrote: ‘Does anyone know where I can get some dodgy Aptamil Comfort on the black market, I’ll pay good money!!!’

It had been feared that the products would not return on to the shelves until mid-March, but Danone said that it has responded to parents’ demands to bring forward the date to next week.

A spokesman said: ‘We very much regret that we are currently experiencing a shortage of these two milks which means parents are experiencing low and patchy availability.

‘We would like to apologise to parents who are using these milks as we are very aware of difficulties they are experiencing. Unfortunately we have experienced a production delay due to the shortage of one key ingredient. 

‘Our careline operates 24/7 and as a priority we are helping parents to locate retailers who have these milks in stock. We recommend parents contact their health care professional if they need further advice.’

Danone spokesperson Helen Messenger said the company had been 'let down' by its maize starch supplier.

She said: 'We only use pre-approved suppliers, we don't buy our ingredients from the open market because babies have to have the best quality standards.

'Unfortunately on this occasion we were let down by our supplier, however, we have pulled all the stops out and we have made more of that formula and it will be coming back on to shelves next week.'

Maize starch, also known as corn starch or cornflour, is used as a thickening agent in liquid-based foods including soups, gravies and sauces.

Better times: A healthy-looking crop in an American corn maize field. Last year the industry was hit by the worst drought in decades, leading to a shortage of the crop

But US farmers were last year hit by the worst drought to affect the industry in decades, which has led to shortages of corn.

Earlier this month it was reported two dozen ethanol plants had been forced to halt production due to the shortage of the crop.

Going into 2012, corn producers had high hopes and record harvests had been predicted, but the weather dried up before planting and the drought meant that even though more acres were planted compared to the previous year, 13 per cent less corn was harvested.

Just this week however, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it expected a rebound in production and predicted record corn and soybean harvests for 2013, in its official forecast for the year.

Parents across the country have been taking to social networking sites throughout the week, desperate to get hold of the popular brands of formula milk, since the shortages came to light.

Earlier this week, Andy L was searching for the Aptamil formula when he wrote on Netmums: 'We have been through Yellow Pages and called over 100 places Winsford, Northwich, Crewe, Stafford, Wolverhampton, Cannock, Winchester and Aberdeen.

'Out of those places we found 4 with stock giving us enough milk for 5 weeks, they are now out of stock.'

Meanwhile, Rachel E wrote: 'I am in exactly the same position as everyone else. We have had Aptamil Comfort for the last 20 weeks which my little girl is really happy on. Have been forced to try Cow and Gate Comfort but she's not happy as her tummy is making funny noises again, she's windy and doesn't drink her whole bottle again!!!

'Now I can't get either of them anywhere in my local area, we have called every possible store/supermarket/independent chemist absolutely everywhere and no one has any comfort milk.

'It's a nightmare and I can't believe that two huge companies like Aptamil and Cow and Gate have allowed this to happen.'

Sam W also took to Netmums yesterday to write: 'GRRR I have been trying to get hold of Cow and Gate Comfort for the last week and we are now down to the last few bottles worth of formula....I cant believe they didn't announce anything!!!'

Parents this morning were continuing to panic after being unable to buy any of the formula milk.

One Twitter user called Jules wrote: 'I've just checked online and apparently Cow and Gate Comfort milk is unavailable everywhere!!!! What am I supposed to do now?'

Meanwhile, Dave James yesterday tweeted: 'URGENT! Can anyone get hold of any Cow and Gate Comfort formula milk? There's a shortage and we know a baby who can't feed on anything else.'
