Lottery: Pregnant women are facing a 'postcode lottery' researchers at the Perinatal Institute say

One thousand babies die each year after midwives fail basic checks on mothers-to-be, a report shows.

Pregnant women are facing a 'postcode lottery' researchers at the Perinatal Institute say.

Some midwives are lacking training in how to spot the warning sigsn of stillbirth and Professor Jason Gardosi, from the institute, urged the NHS to follow guidance. 

The Times reports hospitals are not using tape measures and charts properly and one in every 200 children is stillborn which gives the UK one of the worst records in the developed world.

NHS England says it is urging hospitals to improve measurements of baby growth but Professor Gardosi said the equivalent of a 'classroom of children a week' are dying.

His team has worked in the West Midlands and has cut stillbirth rates by 22 per cent over the last five years but nationally rates have not fallen for 20 years.

Research published in the BMJ Open medical journal shows hospitals in the North East and Yorkshire use training and stillbirths had fallen as a result. 

Only 46 hospitals, which amounts to a third of all births in England, have staff trained in spotting growth problems.

Professor Gardosi wants to make sure hospitals are using the approved system designed by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.

He told the Times: 'We hope it will not become a postcode lottery for mothers... at a cost of 50p per pregnancy, the programme should be affordable for even the most cash-strapped unit.'

Catherine Calderwood, national clinical director for maternity at NHS England, said the system should be used around the country.
