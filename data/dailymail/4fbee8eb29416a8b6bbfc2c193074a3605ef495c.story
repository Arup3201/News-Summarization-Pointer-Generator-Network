The rogue American soldier who shot dead 16 Afghan civilians in their beds may havelaunched the killing spree for revenge after seeing his friend’s leg blown off by a bomb the day before the massacre.

The highly decorated veteran was also traumatised by two battle wounds, suffering brain damage and losing part of his foot, his lawyer said yesterday.

A high-ranking U.S. official also claimed the gunman was drunk when he embarked on the rampage.

‘When it all comes out it will be a combination of stress, alcohol and marital issues – he just snapped,’ the aide said.

The revelations came amid growing anger in Afghanistanover the decision to fly the soldier out of the country. He was initially taken to Kuwait but is expected to be flown back to the U.S. because the Kuwaitis don’t want to get caught up in the row.

Afghans, furious over the attack on defenceless villagers – which left nine children among the dead– fear they won’t get justice if the soldier is tried in America.

The 38-year-old father of two from Seattle has not been named by the military because of concernthat his young family could be targeted. He has two children, aged three and four.

His lawyer, John Browne, said the family provided him with details of the injury to his friend.

He said: ‘His leg was blown off, and my client was standing next to him.’

During tours in Iraq, the suspect suffered a head injury in a car accident caused by a roadsidebomb and a battle-related injury that resulted in surgery to remove part of his foot.

Mr Browne has spoken briefly by phone with the soldier, who was ‘stunned and distant’.

His family were ‘totally shocked’, he said. ‘He’s never said anything antagonistic about Muslims.

He’s in general very mild-mannered.’ The family were unaware of any drink problem, and he described the couple’s marriage as ‘fabulous’.
