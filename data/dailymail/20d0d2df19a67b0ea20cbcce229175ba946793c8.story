Alex Salmond has broken his promise not to politicise the Commonwealth Games quicker than a Usain Bolt sprint by declaring Glasgow will become the ‘Freedom city’.

As Scotland’s athletes prepared for the 11 biggest days of their lives, the First Minister resorted to his tired old ‘Braveheart’ rhetoric.

He claimed he was confident Glasgow would vote Yes in the referendum – in the same breath as insisting he would not use the Games as a campaigning pawn.

First Minister Alex Salmond appears to have broken his promise not to use the Commonwealth Games to push his campaign for independence

David Cameron also slipped pro-Union lines into his speech to the Commonwealth Games Business Conference, in which he praised ‘the UK – with Scotland at its heart’.

And as Scotland’s biggest city welcomed competitors and spectators from around the world, the First Minister snidely toasted Chancellor George Osborne’s return to London.

‘I’m on this self-denying ordinance, so I’m trying not to get drawn into argy-bargy with George Osborne. He’ll go back to London and then we’ll all get on with enjoying ourselves at the Games,’ Mr Salmond told the Evening Times newspaper.

‘That’s what I intend to do over the next 10 days and I’m sure I speak for everybody in Glasgow and Scotland. What I would say is I’m confident Yes will win in Glasgow.

‘(The) latest poll indicated that swing last week and I’m confident we will win the city of Glasgow so I suppose you could call Glasgow Freedom city.’

His bravado came despite the most recent poll of polls showing a 14-point lead for the No campaign.

The polls have also shown that Scots are desperate for a hiatus from the frequently bitter independence debate while the Games is on – but the First Minister - who tried to coin the term ‘Scolympians’ to refer to Scottish competitors in the GB team at London 2012 - could not help himself.

He said: ‘I think Sir Harry Burns put his finger on it. The Chief Medical Office, recently retired believes the key to success in facing the deep-seated health problems of this city and this country because it’s not specific to Glasgow, is the sense of empowerment that independence will bring.

‘He thinks it will change people’s lives for the better, not just the country and the economy, but people’s lives and that was a very powerful message from Scotland’s most respected physician.

‘Also practical things, we won’t have bedroom taxes and oppression of the poor which is what happens from Westminster at present so we won’t have regressive policies that bear down on the poor, led by people like George Osborne.

‘The amount of money he has taken out of this city is huge.’

Prime Minister David Cameron and wife Samantha were seen chatting with Mr Salmond during a reception at the opening of the Games

During his visit, Mr Osborne pledged £24million to health technology, the arts and business in Glasgow, promising to turn the city into a ‘global powerhouse’.

Earlier this month, the UK Government promised Glasgow would receive a £500million windfall – which was then matched by the Scottish Government – for major infrastructure projects, which will help create 15,000 construction jobs and 28,000 permanent jobs once work is over.

At the business conference, the Prime Minister also stressed the importance of London to Edinburgh’s financial district.

‘One of the UK’s greatest strengths is financial services. It’s a Scottish strength, too, supporting 200,000 jobs here,’ he said.

‘And there is an inextricable link between the success of the City of London and the globally renowned financial centres of Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Dundee and Glasgow.’

Mr Cameron used a speech in Glasgow to insisted he wanted Scotland to remain in the UK

Political opponents urged Mr Salmond to leave the point-scoring to the athletes while the Games is on.

Willie Rennie MSP, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader said: ‘This is desperate stuff from Alex Salmond who is now reverting to type as a chest-beating Braveheart cheerleader.

‘This is tired old rhetoric from a desperate politician trying to shore up support. The people of Glasgow have heard it all before.

‘It was free by 93, free by 2003, but none of it happens. He should focus on giving the answers to people’s questions and cut the cheesy movie lines.’

Patricia Ferguson MSP, Scottish Labour’s culture and sport spokeswoman, added: ‘These comments are offensive and misleading. Glasgow is already a free city and certainly doesn’t need Alex Salmond to liberate it.

‘At a time when Glasgow is pulling together to put on the Commonwealth Games, the First Minister should not be playing politics.

‘The Commonwealth Games are in Glasgow because politicians of all parties worked together but Alex Salmond seems to have broken his own promise to stop campaigning during the events on day one.’

He was also accused of complacency in claiming victory in the host city.

A Scottish Conservative spokesman said: ‘Alex Salmond should not take the voters of Glasgow for granted.

‘He hailed victory in the city before the results of the 2012 council elections were officially announced and lost, and will be defeated again in September.’

Justine and Ed Miliband were at the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games last night, but today she will be campaigning against Scottish independence on her own

A Better Together spokesman added: ‘Alex Salmond not talking about his obsession for 10 days? He can’t even manage 10 seconds.

‘We have been debating the referendum for over two years. It surely can’t be beyond even Alex Salmond to take a step back and let Glasgow’s Games take centre stage.’

Meanwhile, Justine Miliband is to hit the campaign trail without husband Ed today in a move which will dramatically raise her profile.

The environmental lawyer will climb aboard Labour’s battlebus in Glasgow to urge voters to reject Scottish independence. 

In an unusual development, Mr Miliband will not join be by her side, in what will be seen as a trial run for his wife to play a central role in next year’s general election campaign.

A Labour source said: ‘She is up in Scotland and wanted to take part in a bit of Better Together campaigning. Like lots of people in Labour, she feels strongly that the UK should stick together.

'It is a big question on the future of our country and she wants to take part in the campaign.
