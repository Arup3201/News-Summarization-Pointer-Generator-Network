Lower-priced shampoo can leave hair cleaner than much more expensive products, researchers have claimed.

Cambridge University scientists studied 20 brands and top of the shampoos was L’Oreal’s Elvive Nutri-gloss Light shampoo which costs just £3.99 for a large bottle.

It left locks cleaner than products which cost up to £100 a tub.

The tests were carried out by Colm Durkan, a researcher into 
nanotechnology - particles so small that 300 million would fit on a 
pinhead.

Dr Durkan, who is also a scientist at specialist firm CambridgeNano, 
used one of the world’s most powerful microscopes to measure how well a 
selection of shampoos cleaned hair.

By comparing unwashed and washed hair, he was able to look at how 
effective the various products were at removing tiny bits of dirt and 
grease.

And roughness of the hair provided clues to the amount of chemical residue they left behind.

The L’Oreal product left hair the cleanest.

Dr Durkan told the Sunday Times: ‘A clean hair under the microscope 
looks like a smooth surface, whereas dirty hair is covered with 
particles of grease or dust.

‘What surprised me the most was that I couldn’t see any difference 
between what the most expensive shampoos do compared with other cheaper 
ones.’

L’Oreal’s shampoo also left the fewest residues.

In contrast, the tests showed Philip B Russian Amber Imperial Shampoo, 
which costs up to £100 for a large tub, to leave behind ‘significant 
residues’.

Another luxury product, Oribe’s Shampoo for Beautiful Color, also left sizeable deposits.

However, hair care companies point that that leaving residues behind isn’t necessarily a bad thing.

For instance, they could contain conditioning or anti-dandruff treatments.

Oribe said: ‘Cleansing is only one element of a high-performance shampoo.

‘Adding moisture, treating the scalp and aiding colour retention are equally important.’

A spokesman for Philip B said its product deposits amino acids - building blocks of proteins - on the hair.

Chris Flower, of the trade body, the Cosmetics, Toiletry and Perfumery 
Association, said: ‘These days the difference between shampoos is less 
about how effective they are at cleaning the hair and more about the 
additional benefits, which may be conditioning, protection from heat or 
other damage.

‘Measuring the roughness of hair or deposits left after cleaning is just a part of the story.’ 
The UK market in hair care products is worth almost £1.5billion, with 
home hair dyes proving particularly popular in recent years.

Shampoo is, however, the most popular product, accounting for almost a quarter of the sales.

A spokesman for market research firm Euromonitor International said 
recently: ‘In good times as well as in bad times, consumers do not stop 
buying and using shampoo, but they keep an eye on promotions such as 
“buy one for £3.50 or buy two for £5”.

‘UK consumers are keen on these kinds of offers, and they have proven successful.’

Renewed interest in dry shampoo has also boosted sales.
