A ban on hosepipes for 20 million people - the strictest ever imposed - is now in force across most of the south and east of the country.

It follows two consecutive dry winters and water firms say the ban is likely to last until the autumn if not into next year, even if there is normal rainfall during the summer.

But the Environment Agency have warned the 
hosepipe ban is just the first step to help conserve water supplies, in 
the worst drought since 1976.

Dry as a bone: Five-year-old Isla Stanton paddling in Bewl Water Reservoir near Lamberhurst, Kent, which is currently standing at 49 per cent of its capacity

Last resort: A return to standpipes in the street, used in the drought of 1976 is the final option if water levels continue to drop

The Environment Agency have warned the 
hosepipe ban is the first step to help conserve water supplies, in 
the worst drought since 1976.

After the hosepipe ban there are in effect, three water-saving stages: 1. If
water levels continue to drop then the second stage is caps on 
non-essential business use such as watering golf courses, cleaning 
pavements and car washes could follow.2. Next public and commercial swimming pools will be instructed to shut down as well as industries which rely on mains supplies such as food processors. 3. Finally there could be a time table imposed when people are told to only use water at set times. Another measure could be asking certain areas to share standpipes in the street, similar to what residents in 1976 experienced when there was a severe drought

Finally there could be a timetable imposed when people are told to only use water at set times.

Another measure could be asking certain areas to share standpipes in the
street, similar to what residents in 1976 experienced when there was a 
severe drought.

Seven
Water companies Thames Water, Southern Water, South East, Veolia 
Central and South East and Sutton and East Surrey Water have all imposed
bans.

A list of eleven activities banned in
the 2010 Water Management Act includes using hosepipes to wash the car,
water plants and clean windows; fill fountains, ponds and paddling 
pools and even hose down children on a hot day.

And that's where it gets confusing. 
Water companies are allowed to interpret the rules however they wish, 
meaning some activities are banned by one water company and allowed by 
another.

Southern Water customers will be able to wash their cars with a hosepipe, but neighbours supplied by South East Water will not.

Those who flout the ban could be forced to pay a £1,000 fine, after being sent a single 'yellow card' warning in the post.

Even spraying your children to keep them cool in the sunshine will be outlawed, and those caught breaking the rules face a £1,000 fine.

The strict rules are an attempt to close any loopholes after the last 
hosepipe ban in 2006 led to widespread accusations of cheating, with 
thousands reported to water companies by their neighbours or served with
'yellow card' letters warning them to obey the law.

Commenting on the likelihood of returning to standpipes, Water UK, which represents major UK water suppliers said 'We think it's very unlikely - 
we would look at it as a last resort.'

Second stage: If water levels continue to drop then the next stage after the current hosepipe ban is asking non-essential users such as golf courses and car washes to stop using water

Closed down: If water levels do not improve then then the next stage is public and commercial swimming pools have to close and water intensive industries like food processors that use mains supplies

Anglian
Water said 'The environmental drought is a very serious situation, but 
at this stage standpipes are a very distant prospect which we are not 
even contemplating at this stage.

'We
are confident that our customers recognise the severity of the 
situation and will do what they can to help save water across our 
region.'

Martin Baggs, Chief Executive of Thames Water said:

'Groundwater
levels in the aquifers, which we rely on for both borehole and river 
supplies, are well below where we would normally expect them to be. In 
some cases they are at their lowest levels ever recorded at this time of
year.

'We know these restrictions will be unpopular, but they 
will save a lot of water. A garden sprinkler uses as much water in an 
hour as a family of four uses in a day, and when water is in short 
supply, the needs of families must come first.

Feeling the pinch: Many businesses are already feeling effects of the hosepipe ban: garden centres face singificant losses as people will not be buying plants if they cannot water them

Still waters: The famous fountains in Trafalgar Square have been turned off as part of a hosepipe ban imposed across Southern England as a result of low rainfall this winter

Running dry: Tourists may not be able to cool off this summer in London's Trafalgar Square fountains after the water supply was turned off under the hosepipe ban

The hosepipe ban is already causing problems for business -  for example garden
centres are facing significant losses as people will not be purchasing plants if they
cannot water them. 

Earlier this week Thames Water ordered the water supply to London'sTrafalgar Square's fountains  be cut as part of a blanket restriction, which includes ornamental fountains, designed to conserve drought-hit reservoirs.

The Greater London Authority said the current water stocks feeding the fountains will run out at the weekend.

Negotiations are underway to see if a compromise can be found in time for the arrival of millions of tourists to Trafalgar Square during the Olympic and Jubilee summer.

Water companies said that without 
persistent above-average rainfall for several weeks, the unpopular 
measures could last until the end of the summer in the 14 counties which
are already officially in drought.

Otherwise
they face 'severe drought' by the summer, the Environment Agency warned
yesterday, which could result in extending restrictions to businesses.

Hosepipe
bans may also be enforced in  East Yorkshire and Wiltshire which are at
'high risk' of drought conditions this summer, the agency's Drought 
Prospects report said.

Dry: The River Kennet in the village of Lockeridge, near Marlborough, is just one of many waterways with record low levels as England faces a strict hosepipe ban to combat the drought

Its
chairman Lord Smith urged businesses to cut down on use, as electricity
companies which use water for cooling and water-intensive industries 
such as concrete manufacturing could be affected.

The Met Office's long-range forecast,
which is given to Government and businesses, revealed that the chances 
of heavy rain are as low as 10 per cent between March and May, compared 
with a long-term average of 20 per cent.

The
average person uses 150 litres of water a day. Water company 
infrastructure across England and Wales leaked 3.4billion litres a day 
in 2010/11 – a third of the UK's usage – according to the regulator 
Ofwat.

Drought 
conditions are already affecting fruit and cereal crops, as well as 
destroying wildlife habitats and causing fish to die in low rivers.

Justin Taberham of the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management said that if consumers do not start curbing their water use at home, the economy will be affected.

'If water levels in drought-stricken areas don't improve, hosepipe bans could be just the beginning and industry will start to be affected,' he said.

This is one of the largest hosepipe bans ever implemented. The last in the South was in 2006 affecting 12million people, and 7million in the North East were hit in 2010.
