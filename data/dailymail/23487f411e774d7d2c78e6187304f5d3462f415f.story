It may be their last night out as husband and wife.

Terminally ill Robert Vannucci's dying wish to share a meal with his wife of 46 years, Nancy, was fulfilled on Tuesday.

With the help of the National Hospice 
Foundation, the couple enjoyed dinner at Nora’s Italian Cuisine in Las Vegas - one of their favorite places.

Emotional: Robert Vannucci, who is terminally ill, and his wife Nancy were treated to dinner at Nora's Italian Cuisine and a limousine ride by the Nathan Adelson Hospice and the Lighthouse of Hope Fund in Las Vegas on Tuesday

'I deal with it just by loving him, 
and taking care of him each day that we have together,' Nancy, 65, told Las Vegas Review-Journal.

'I 
don’t know when it’s going to happen, but I do know he and I are going 
to live each day that we have.'

Robert, 66, suffers from brain disease, either Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease or Lewy body dementia.

While doctors have not settled on a precise diagnosis, they say Robert is 'too far gone' for effective treatment.

Neither disease is 
curable, and both can lead to loss of control of the body and the mind.

The former Riviera on the Strip president never leaves the house, sleeps almost constantly and can barely walk on some days. He could be gone in the next six months.

But Nancy has always stood by her man, the father of her three children.

'It’s my soul being taken away from me,' Nancy said. 'We’ve been together for so long. He’s a good man.'

The devoted couple met at work in 1967, Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.

Nancy was a telephone operator at Dunes Hotel, while Robert worked the front desk.

One day, he sent her a note through the 
hotel’s pneumatic tube messaging system begging for a date. 

She agreed. They married about a month later.

'It was love at first sight,' Nancy laughed. 'His mother about had a heart attack.'

But for the Vannuccis, romantic moments are few and far between these days. 

The family 'lost everything' a few years ago after Riviera Holdings Corp went bankrupt. Robert's health began to deteriorate soon after.

Being chosen by the National Hospice
and Palliative Care Association's make a wish program - enabling one of their patients to live out a final wish - was a dream come true for the Vannuccis.

A limousine picked up the couple and took them to the restaurant for a delicious and emotional meal. 

'This means so much,' Nancy said. 'To him [Robert], it means everything.'
