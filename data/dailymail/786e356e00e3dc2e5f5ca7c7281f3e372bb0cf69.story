An old-fashioned romantic who made a promise with his wife to renew their wedding vows on their 60th anniversary has held the ceremony two months early - after being diagnosed with terminal cancer.

Ellis Coakey, 84, had always wanted to give wife Ellen, 83, a diamond anniversary to remember by throwing her the party the newly-weds could not afford first time around in 1954.

But last summer the former plumbing engineer was diagnosed with lung cancer and it was feared he would not be well enough to keep his promise.

Mr Coakey said: 'It's something that I promised years ago and I was determined to do it'

However, Mr Coakey, of Over Hulton, near Bolton, defied his illness and proposed again to former coat factory machinist Ellen - suggesting the ceremony be brought forward.

The couple, who have eight great-grandchildren, renewed their vows in a ceremony at Farnworth Care Home, near Bolton, Greater Manchester attended by family, friends and care home staff.

Mr Coakey said: 'It’s something that I promised years ago and I was determined to do it.

'I always said that when we come to the 60th anniversary rather than forget about everything we will renew the vows. I never break a promise as long as I can help it.

'If I say I will do something I will do it. I had planned this years ago, but it fell by the wayside.

'This is the celebration we always said we’d do and I’m really pleased we’ve done it.'

The pair met in 1952 through Ellen’s brother, who was friends with Ellis, and they courted for two years before getting married on May 8 1954 at St Sebastian’s Church in Salford with only two other people in attendance.

The keen dancers went on to have two daughters - Adrienne, 53, and 58-year-old Elaine - and also eight grandchildren.

They were initially due to renew vows on their golden anniversary until cancer struck their son-in-law Paul Hilton, 60.

Mr Hilton was at Sunday’s ceremony to see Ellis, who served with the Royal Engineers in Egypt as part of his National Service, plant a kiss on former sewing machinist Ellen as they celebrated more than sixty years of happiness together.

The ceremony took place at Farnworth Care Home and was attended by family, friends and care home staff

Mr Coakey added: 'We always said that we would renew our vows but we were waiting until the official anniversary on May 8. But then things started to progress with the cancer so I said bring it forward and we will get it done.

'We didn’t even have parties on our 25th or 50th anniversaries so this is the first big get-together.'

Ellen joked that the pair had lasted so long because they were ‘a pair of idiots’. She added: 'He is a big romantic and he’s been very good to me.

'It was a big surprise and I knew nothing about his plans. If that’s what he wants to do then that’s what I will do.

'It was a shock when he told me about the cancer. But it’s there and we’ve got to face up to it. There’s no point hiding from it now.'

Watching her beloved husband of six decades battle cancer has been hard for Ellen

She added: 'But we’ve never been apart in all the years we have been together. We’ve never had a period apart.

'We’ve always been together as a family and we will be for as long as we have left.

'It’s been hard watching Ellis suffer, because we’ve never been apart. We’ve always been together. We do everything together. But now we’re in this situation, we’ve just got on with it.

'All the staff at the home have been great - I can’t thank them enough for the help they’ve given us.'

Daughter Adrienne Hilton, 53, said: 'It was a lovely day and a fantastic little service.

'Although I was happy to see mum and dad renewing the vows it was a day of mixed emotions with the news we have already had.'

'Everyone was absolutely devastated about the news last summer but I think given what we have got to face having the wedding vows renewed was a lovely idea. My dad is a big softy really but men don’t usually like to show their feelings.'

She added: 'They’ve been together such a long time and they have been a wonderful mum and dad so we will support them with anything they want. They are adored by the grandkids.'

Jacinta Hodgson, activities co-ordinator at the home, said: 'I only met Ellis a few weeks ago and I just thought it was so lovely to do what they have done and now I’ve got to know him I’ve been able to see just what a lovely guy he is.

'I can’t stop talking about him and Ellen at home because it’s so sweet. It’s just lovely after all these years together.'

Mr Coakey added: 'The staff here have been so good and put on a buffet on and some were saying they were gutted they weren’t coming so I invited them too.

'I’m going to be living with them for the next few months or years or however long so I had to ask them to come.'
