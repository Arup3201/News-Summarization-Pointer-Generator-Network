Mystery deepens as an autopsy concludes that a bear found dead in Central Park on Monday was most likely run over and killed by a vehicle.

The bear cub was just six-months-old when she suffered from blunt force trauma characteristic of an auto accident, said the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) who conducted a necropsy in an Albany lab.

As to what the bear was doing in the park is a mystery since black bears are not known to live in or roam in the park in the populated city.

NBC reports that there were no reports of missing bears from the Central Park Zoo.

The bear was discovered by a dog walker near West 69th street and West Drive just before 10 a.m. on Monday.

The dog walker then notified a Central Park Conservancy worker who contacted police.

'Whenever any wildlife is hurt or harmed we are upset about it,' said Elizabeth Kaledin, a spokeswoman for Central Park Conservancy.

The DEC is investigating potential law violations.

If caught, someone may face charges related to illegal possession, transport, and disposal of an un-tagged bear.

People Magazine spoke with one witness named Florence Slatkin who spotted the dead cub when she and her friend were leaving the park and her friend's terrier noticed the bear.

'At first, we thought it was a bag of clothes or maybe a dead dog,' said Slatkin who lives near the park.

Upon closer observation they realized that it was a small bear.

'with its mouth wide open and scratches on the side.'

Slatkin says that the bear's head was resting on top of a bicycle wheel.

Police have dusted the bicycle for prints.  

The investigation is ongoing.
