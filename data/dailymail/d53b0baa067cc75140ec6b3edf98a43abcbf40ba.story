Their original owners are long since dead but amazingly these genuine 19th century tattoos are still pulling in a few admiring glances.

They form part of a weird and wonderful collection of  tattooed human skin which has just been put on display in Bucharest, Romania.

The collection once belonged to the late Dr Nicolae Minovici, a famous Romanian forensic scientist, who grafted them  from  bodies held at the Institute of Forensic Medicine where he was the manager.

The fascinating exhibition is of tattooed human skin from the collection of Dr. Nicolae Minovici, a Romanian forensic scientist

One of his studies looked into a possible connection between tattoos and criminal behaviour.

The exhibit consists of pieces of tattooed skin, taken from a range of subjects, from the late 19th to early 20th century. 

Among the most fascinating tattoos on display are those which once belonged to Alexandru Popescu, a tailor born in Bucharest in 1900, who has a special corner in the exhibition. 

At the age of 27, Popescu enlisted in the French Foreign Legion and was sent to Morocco to fight the rebellious tribes.

For the manufacture of the tattooing ink soot obtained from burning a liter of oil and 300 grams was combined with fresh urine

Many of the tattoos come from the body of a former French Foreign Legionary for whom the North Star was a particularly important symbol

The pieces of skin, including this mermaid tattoo, left, are part of the collection of the late Dr. Mina Minovici, a Romanian forensic scientist, right

While serving in the legion he was tattooed on various parts of the body by a colleague, a Czechoslovakian, wanted in his native country for counterfeiting banknotes.

For the manufacture of the tattooing ink they used soot obtained from burning a liter of oil and 300 grams of fresh urine. 

The drawings depicts his Popescu's  fiancée and a representation of the North Star, a common symbol among mercenaries in the Foreign Legion. 

The exhibition is being held at Suțu Palace, the main location of the Museum of Bucharest, and runs until April 30, 2015.
