She scooped best designer at the prestigious British plus-size fashion awards so as Gemma Collins unveils her fifth clothing collection, she has every right to be proud of her achievements.

'I've changed fashion,' she says boldly. 'Women can get beautiful plus-size clothes thanks to me and I've opened a lot of doors for the industry. That's why I'll be here for my 120th collection.'

Speaking to MailOnline at the launch of her SS14 range, Gemma, 33, describes the response to her collections as 'overwhelming'.

'It's crazy to think I was once a car dealer from Romford and now I've got this fashion empire. I have proven there's a massive market for plus-size women and my new range sort of says "Come on, girls! You're going to look amazing this summer",' she said.

Gemma explains that she has been up most mornings at 4am working on her fifth range, which is full of flirty kaftans, lace dresses and casual tops that she promises will be 'a wardrobe staple for anyone'.

Named after Caribbean islands, such as St. Barts and Barbados, Gemma says that each design will transport you to the place and the bright colours of each design will brighten up everyone's wardrobes this summer.

And it seems that it's already working wonders - Gemma has had countless people stopping her in the street to thank her for designing clothes for fuller-figured women - and she always stops to have a photo with them.

Glamorous: From casual dresses to more dazzling 
evening wear, Gemma believes that she has the skills and knowledge 
required to create a fashion empire - and she wants her own shop next to

She doesn't care for celebrities wearing her range and would rather see 'everyday women' rocking her styles.

'As long as everyday women on the school run feel confident in it, I am happy. My designs prove you can be bigger and still look glamorous.'

Gemma, whose friends say all she ever talks about is her range, believes that she has the skills and knowledge required to create a fashion empire.

'You have to be big to design for plus-size women, you have to know what it feels like.

'In the next few years, I see myself having a flagship store on Oxford Street next to Topshop and there will be a Gemma Collins store in every town.

'I get so many people emailing me requesting me to open up in their town.'

Aside from her successful design career, Gemma has been enjoying a break from TOWIE and says she is in a good place.

'I was deeply unhappy last year but I'm the happiest I've been in a long time. I'm back to my old self and having loads of fun.'

After a tumultuous engagement, Gemma is single and ready to mingle. 'I've been on some lovely dates,' she said. 'I'd love to use Tinder but I believe in fate and just want to have fun.

'We're heading to Marbella in seven weeks, it's going to be amazing, watch this space.'

So will Gemma be following the famed 'no carbs before Marbs' diet that the cast of TOWIE have popularised ahead of her summer jaunt?

'I'll never give up the old carbs but I've been healthier lately and lost a bit of weight. I have time when we aren't filming to make better food choices and prepare healthier meals.

'Let's just say, I'm going wild in Marbella!'
