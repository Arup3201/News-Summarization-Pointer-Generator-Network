With her creamy skin, toned legs and impressive embonpoint, it is no wonder Sophie Wessex drew admiring glances when she stepped out in a bright red swimsuit on a Spanish beach this week.

As she approaches her 50th birthday next January, the Sloany frump who married a Prince has disappeared and, in her place, is a svelte and confident mother of two who has lost weight and isn’t afraid to try daring new styles.

ALISON BOSHOFF reveals how the ‘Baywatch Countess’ got ready for the beach — and what prompted her amazing make-over.

Sophie, who is 50 in January, has blitzed her upper arms with the help of Pilates and a personal trainer.

The Countess of Wessex joins some of the other mums at the  private prep school attended by her children at a local Pilates class in Windsor once a week.

A trainer comes every week to her home, Bagshot Park in Surrey. Working out on a cross-trainer and swimming have banished any bingo wings.

‘Sophie’s exercises are geared towards her shape and working with what she has,’ says a source.

‘Now she is toned, she looks much better in fitted dresses and suits. She doesn’t do much weightlifting because she doesn’t want veins like Angelina Jolie.’

When Prince Edward saw how well she was doing, he signed up with her personal trainer.

His workout is based on Royal Marines exercises — though he dropped out of the famously tough unit after just a few months.

She's lost a stone, dropping from a size 14 to a 12 through good old- fashioned cardiovascular exercise.

Sophie goes for five-mile runs with Prince Edward twice a week and runs on her own most days.

The result is she can wear nipped in waistlines.

Gone are the boxy jackets and sensible skirts.

In their place are dresses by Emilia Wickstead — a favourite of the Duchess of Cambridge — and a sensational £1,500 electric blue Roland Mouret bodycon dress with a sexy back zipper she wore at the Easter service at Windsor Castle.

Blessed with a peaches and cream complexion, much like her late mother Mary, Sophie is beautifully translucent close-up.

She wears very little make-up and uses a light spray tan when she wears a backless dress or before a holiday, such as her Spanish break.

However, unlike the Duchess of Cambridge, she’s not afraid of tanning naturally.

It’s something she can hardly avoid, given her outdoorsy lifestyle of running and riding.

Indeed, she sports a tan line around her freckled neck, attesting to her love of the sun.

But despite her new streamlined body, she’s eschewed Botox, accepting the fine lines around her eyes and across her forehead.

They've always been sturdy, but Sophie’s legs are now much more toned and muscular, thanks to running and riding horses.

Most Saturday mornings, Sophie rides with the family — Edward, ten-year-old Lady Louise and James, Viscount Severn, six, who have their own ponies — at Windsor Castle, 11 miles from their home.

She is regularly seen on horseback alongside the Queen, to whom she is close. Her Majesty always chooses Sophie to sit next to her on the way to church at Christmas and Easter. They share a great knowledge of  and interest in military history.

Sources say the Duchess has done a lot of work on her thighs and they’ve been further toned by her love of skiing — the family took their regular winter holiday in St Moritz this year.

However, despite meeting Edward at a Real Tennis event in 1993, she’s not an enthusiastic player any more.

Nor does she still play the golf she once loved. ‘She won’t acknowledge she isn’t any good,’ says a source. ‘Certainly not as good as Kate or Pippa in this respect.’

After being plagued by health problems — she had an ectopic pregnancy in 2001 and nearly died from a placental abruption in 2003 - Sophie is keen to safeguard her future health.

A key part of this is following a nutrient-packed diet.

A royal source said: ‘She’s forward-looking and grateful for what she has.

‘Sophie is focused and has very much put all her troubles behind her. She certainly takes her fitness, diet and health seriously.’

While the Countess is not on a diet, she’s health conscious about what she eats, favouring smoothies or sometimes porridge for breakfast.

Otherwise, she likes chicken and fish, plus lots of fresh fruit — she loves watermelon and grapes.

However, she does not eat bread, pastries, fry-ups or snacks.

Desserts are sorbets and fruit rather than sugary puddings.

Sophie enjoys entertaining, but a Wessex supper party is simple: fish pie and salad or the occasional risotto.

Even the handmade sausages she indulges in at Prince Philip’s barbecues in Scotland are served with a healthy avocado salad.

And, like Edward, she barely touches alcohol, even at official events.

The children have a similarly healthy diet and are not allowed snacks, biscuits or chips.

At tea parties they are allowed a slice of carrot or beetroot cake.

Sophie is sporting £245 Bulgari sunglasses — the designer brand favoured by the flashy and well-heeled, such as WAG Coleen Rooney and Lauren Silverman, Simon Cowell’s girlfriend.

However, on the beach Sophie wrapped herself up in a Disney-branded white towelling cover-up costing around £30 — something the likes of Coleen and Lauren would never be seen in.

Designer: Like the WAGs, Sophie has a penchant for Bulgari, which she showcased with these sunglasses

Like every woman approaching middle age, Sophie appreciates the importance of good support, be it in a swimsuit or a gala dress.

This red swimsuit by celebrity designer Melissa Odabash has ruching and padded cups (‘for an effortless holiday cover-up,’ claims the Selfridges website) to make the cleavage look as good as possible.

While many women avoid red for fear of looking predatory, Sophie has actually picked the most flattering choice.

As lips and cheeks naturally lose their pink tint as we age, due to a drop in oestrogen levels, a bright swimming costume provides a flattering injection of colour, warming up the skin.

Long before Kate Middleton started going to Richard Ward’s salon in Mayfair, Sophie was a customer.

But the Duchess of Cambridge apparently kick-started her make-over. ‘Sophie didn’t want to be upstaged,’ says one well-placed royal source.

She is blonder than she’s ever been, having creamy highlights every six weeks.

And at an age when many women opt to cut their hair short, she’s grown hers to below her shoulders, though she wears it in a ponytail or chignon for formal engagements.
