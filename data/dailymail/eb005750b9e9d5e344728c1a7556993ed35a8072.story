Dead: Victor Brannstrom had just scored for his team when he collapsed on the pitch

A striker for Sweden's fourth-tier football league collapsed and died on the pitch in front of shocked fans just minutes after scoring.

In an echo of Bolton Wanderers star Fabrice Muamba, who suffered a mid-match heart attack in March, Victor Brannstrom was jogging back to his team's half of the pitch when he fell to the ground.

The 29-year-old had just put his team, Pitea IF, 1-0 up when he collapsed shortly after scoring in the match against Umedalen yesterday.

The match was abandoned as medics tried to revive Brannstrom on the pitch as they waited for an ambulance.

However, he was pronounced dead shortly after arriving at hospital.

The cause of death was not immediately clear.

Swedish news agency TT says Brannstrom had passed out during a match earlier this year. He took a break from the sport to undergo medical tests but returned after doctors found nothing wrong.

Christer Berglund, Pitea IF spokesman, said: 'He was totally unmarked and was jogging back when he just collapsed.

'People ran out to him right away and within 20 seconds I'd called for an ambulance.'

Officials say Brannstrom had 
collapsed in training earlier this year but a series of tests had failed
 to identify any health problems.

Bergland
 added: 'We can't undo what's been done. He was a healthy and damn nice 
guy with a wife and two kids. It's horrible and traumatic.'

Bolton midfielder Muamba, 24, 
collapsed from a heart attack on the pitch while playing against 
Tottenham at White Hart Lane during an FA Cup tie on March 17.

He received lengthy attention on the pitch and it later emerged that his heart had stopped for 78 minutes.

Remarkably he made a stunning recovery and left hospital a month later.

Muamba travelled to Belgium for a minor heart operation last week, and sought medical advice from a top cardiologist.

It was then when he was told that a return to professional football would put too much strain on his heart.
