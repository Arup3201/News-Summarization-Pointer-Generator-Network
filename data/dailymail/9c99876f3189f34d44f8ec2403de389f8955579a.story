News International has revealed its new title, The Sun on Sunday, will be published for the first time this weekend.

The newspaper will fill the gap in the market left by the News of the World, which closed last year as the phone-hacking scandal unfolded.

And with a fresh crisis gripping The Sun following the arrest of ten current and former journalists, a defiant Rupert Murdoch has decided now is the time to launch its new stablemate.

Mr Murdoch, who flew into the UK on Thursday to take personal control over the latest scandal to hit one of his titles, will be in London for the launch, an internal memo sent to all staff at News International has revealed.

Speculation has begun as to who will edit the new title.

This
morning Sophy Ridge, Sky News political correspondent and former News 
of the World journalist, tweeted: 'I'm told by News International 
sources that Dominic Mohan will be editor of The Sun on Sunday.'

Mr Mohan is currently editor of The Sun. It is not known if he would edit both titles.

The launch comes at a time of high tension at the paper.

Journalists at the tabloid are angry 
that News Corporation’s Management Standards Committee gave police 
information – including the identity of sources – that led to the 
arrests, which include the deputy editor, picture editor and chief 
reporter.

The MSC, which was formed to clean up
the company following the phone-hacking scandal, is trawling through 
internal emails and passing details of suspected illegal activity to 
Scotland Yard.

Mr Murdoch has
moved to quell growing disquiet at The Sun by lifting the suspensions 
of all arrested staff. Ten current and former senior reporters and 
executives have been arrested since 
November over alleged corrupt payments to public officials.

It remains to be seen however whether that will be enough to rebuild trust between management and journalists.

As he lifted the 
suspensions, the media mogul pledged 'unwavering support' for his journalists - but 
reiterated his desire to root out wrongdoing at News International.

Yesterday's email revealing the launch said: 'Rupert Murdoch said 
during his visit on Friday that a new Sunday title would be published 
"very soon" - and that is a week from today. Rupert will be staying in 
London to oversee the launch.'

Speculation
about a Sunday edition of the biggest selling UK daily newspaper has 
been mounting since the closure of the News of the World during the 
hacking scandal.

The email from Tom Mockridge, News 
International's chief executive, acknowledged the parent company's 
previous wrongdoing and said it was 'fundamentally changing'.

It read: 'As you know, News 
Corporation has made clear its determination to sort out what has gone 
wrong in the past and we are fundamentally changing how we operate as a 
business.

'The commitment of News Corporation to invest in a new edition is the strongest possible message of support we could wish for.'

He told staff they would have to act quickly over the coming days.

'This is our moment,' he wrote. 'I am
sure every one of us will seize the opportunity to pull together and 
deliver a great new dawn for The Sun this Sunday.'

Journalists at The Sun, which is owned by News International, have said they are the victims of a 'witch-hunt'

   Rupert Murdoch is not under any legal obligation to hand
over to police any evidence of wrongdoing by his journalists, despite his insistence he is, a leading human
rights lawyer has said.

The News International boss used a letter to staff
explaining his actions relating to the arrest of a number of Sun journalists.

Murdoch told staff that the Management Standards Committee,
which has given up evidence that has led to the arrest of nine Sun journalists
in the past month, would continue to disclose material to the police because
the company was 'obligated' to do so.

But Geoffrey Robertson QC (pictured) has said that Murdoch's letter 'is
full of errors, both of law and history'.

He told the Guardian that the media baron was 'ill-advisedly
and unethically throwing away the shield that parliament gave to journalists in
1984 so they could protect their sources'.

Murdoch's email to staff said: 'We will turn over every
piece of evidence we find – not just because we are obligated to but because it
is the right thing to do,'.

He added that he would 'continue to ensure that all
appropriate steps are taken to protect legitimate journalistic privilege and
sources' but warned he 'cannot protect people who have paid public officials'.

Robertson said: 'Apparently, he thinks it is right to hand
over confidential source material – including the names of whistleblowers – to
police without them even asking.

'This is a breach of the most fundamental ethic that
journalists must not betray their source and there is no law that requires it.

'On the contrary, the 1984 Police and Criminal Evidence Act
defines confidential journalistic material as “excluded material”, which police
cannot seize at all, other than in a few cases such as official secrets, when
they have to get an order from a circuit judge.'

David Wooding, the former political editor of the News of the World, who is now associate editor at The Sun, told Sky News: 'It caught me by surprise.

'Mr Murdoch came round the editorial floor on Friday and said he was launching it very soon.

'We heard rumours of a date in April. This evening, astonishingly, we are told it's going to happen next week.'

He added: 'We don't even know what the staffing levels will be at this stage.

'I'm
told there will be extra staff taken on but this is not the News of the
World in another guise, this is The Sun publishing on another day.'

Dominic Mohan, the editor of The Sun, described it as a 'truly historic moment' in newspaper publishing.

He said: 'Our readers' reaction to the announcement of a seventh-day Sun has been huge and we won't let them down.'

It is believed that there will be a 
senior role at the new title for Victoria Newton, the former News of the
World deputy editor, and current editor of the Saturday edition of The 
Sun.

While Sophy Ridge 
added on Twitter: 'I'm told there will be "some sharing" of Sun staff 
across the daily & sunday editions. This will have big implications 
for the industry.'

Staff have accused the company of a 
‘witch-hunt’ after the Management Standards Committee passed information 
to police that led to the journalists' arrests.

But he warned: 'We will obey the law. Illegal activities simply cannot and will not be tolerated – at any of our publications.'

In an email, the 80-year-old News 
Corporation chairman said recent events were 'a source of great pain for
me, as I know it is for each of you'.

'I’ve worked alongside you for 43 
years to build The Sun into one of the world’s finest papers. It is part
of me and is one of our proudest achievements,' he said.

The Metropolitan Police has arrested and bailed the ten Sun journalists.

All were immediately suspended on full
pay in the wake of the arrests. But Mr Murdoch said he was doing 
'everything to assist' them, including paying their legal fees.

He said they were free to work until any formal charges are made against them.

Despite the invitation, it was not clear if all ten journalists - many of whom were arrested in raids on their homes - would return to work after it was reported that some were considering their options.

News International journalists fear further arrests.

The heavy-handed police tactics have drawn strong criticism, with the Yard accused of diverting officers from murder, rape and terrorism investigations to join ‘Stasi-like’ raids against journalists.

Mr Murdoch, who dramatically closed down the News of the World last July at the height of the phone-hacking scandal, insisted journalists’ ‘legitimate’ confidential sources would be protected.

But he wrote: ‘We will turn over every piece of evidence we find – not just because we are obligated to but because it is the right thing to do.

‘I made a commitment last summer that I would do everything I could to get to the bottom of our problems and make this company an example to Fleet Street of ethical journalism.’

Despite Mr Murdoch's charm offensive, many were still furious about the treatment of their colleagues at the hands of the MSC.

In a sign of how low relations have sunk, one senior staff member dubbed former editor of the Daily Telegraph Will Lewis, an MSC member, the 'chief witch hunter' and said there would be demands that he be sacked.

Sources close to the investigation believe they have uncovered evidence of 'serious suspected criminality over a sustained period' by some public officials supplying The Sun with information, dismissing the suggestion from some reporters that they were being investigated over 'trivial' matters, such as £50 lunches with sources.

The MSC has been feeding Operation Elveden, the police investigation into corrupt payments, with information over the past few months.

In all, 21 people have been held. The five members of Sun staff arrested last weekend were deputy editor of the paper Geoff Webster, chief reporter John Kay, picture editor John Edwards, deputy news editor John Sturgis and chief foreign correspondent Nick Parker.

Also held in the dawn raids were a 39-year-old Ministry of Defence employee and a 36-year-old member of the Armed Forces.

In January, senior members of The Sun's newsroom were held by police and later released on bail.

They were head of news Chris Pharo, executive editor Fergus Shanahan, crime editor Mike Sullivan as well as former managing editor Graham Dudman and a 29-year-old police officer.

In July last year, former chief executive of News International and ex-Sun editor Rebekah Brooks was questioned by detectives as part of Operation Elveden and those involved with Operation Weeting, the investigation into alleged phone hacking by journalists.

In November, long-serving journalist Jamie Pyatt was also arrested in relation to allegations of corrupt payments to police officers.
