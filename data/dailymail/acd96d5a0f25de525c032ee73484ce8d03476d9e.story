Our solar system may well have a twin - because it's thought a nearby solar system has nine planets.

That's just one more than ours, which has eight, following the demotion of Pluto to dwarf-planet status in 2006.

In a new report to be published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics, astronomer Mikko Tuomi  re-analysed data taken of star HD 10180 with High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS), a high-precision camera mounted on a 3.6 meter telescope in Chile

The star has been studied for years because at 130 light years away it is relatively close and therefore brighter and easier for astronomers to examine.

Recent studies detected that the star, which is in the constellation of the water snake Hydrus, hosted six planets and observed a possible seventh planet.

However, the latest research confirmed the existence of the seventh planet and found a further two planets orbiting the star.

Extraordinary: New findings show that the sun-like star could have nine planets orbiting around it

The planets vary drastically in size and include one which is 65 times the Earth’s mass and one estimated to be only 1.4 times heavier than Earth - making it one of the smallest planets discovered outside our own solar system.

The two newly discovered planets weigh in at 1.9 times and 5.1 times heavier than Earth, 'enabling the classification of them as super-Earths,' says the study.

The new planets follow hot orbits, circling their star in under 10 days for the small one, and 68 days for the larger.

Competition: If the findings are proved HD10180's solar system will have more planets than ours since Pluto has been demoted to a dwarf planet

One of the new planets to be discovered and the seventh planet which was confirmed are particularly close to the sun-like star.

The one with a mass of 1.3 times more than Earth is only 3 million km away from HD 10180, closer than mercury is to the sun, making its surface hot enough to melt zinc, tin and possibly even iron.  

The study explained that the star was a ‘very quiet one’ making it unlikely that the activity of the two new planets that they detected was caused by stellar phenomena.

‘Also, the periodicities we report, namely 9.66 and 67.6 days, do not coincide with any periodicities arising from the movement of the bodies in the Solar system. Therefore, we consider the interpretation of these two new signals of being of planetary origin to be the most credible explanation,' the study continued.

Other solar systems generally have four or less planets orbiting a star.
