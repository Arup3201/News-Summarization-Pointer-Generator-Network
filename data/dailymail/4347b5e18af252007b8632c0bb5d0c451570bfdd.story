They were fierce rivals on the cycling track for many years but Victoria Pendleton was quick to praise Australian Anna Meares on her gold-medal success in the women’s 500m time trial.

Pendleton, who won two Olympic golds but lost her final race before retirement to Meares at London 2012, tweeted: ‘Congratulations on gold @AnnaMeares a class performance in the 500m tt.’

Nick's week of celebration

Defending squash men’s single champion Nick Matthew felt no after-effects from his late night carrying England’s flag at Wednesday’s opening ceremony as he thrashed Xavier Koenig, a solicitor from Mauritius, 11-3, 11-3, 11-1 in just 21 minutes on Thursday morning.

And it’s been quite a week for Matthew — he also celebrates his 34th birthday today.

Cricket’s absence from Commonwealth Games will continue at least until the 2018 Games in Australia after the International Cricket Council turned down an invitation from the Commonwealth Games Federation.

South Africa won the gold medal when cricket, in its 50-over format, made its only appearance at the games in Kuala Lumpur in 1998.

Forget flowers, have a quaich...

Successful athletes at Glasgow 2014 receive gold, silver or bronze medals featuring overlapping rings, which weigh 100 grams. 

The medals were designed by jeweller Jonathan Boyd and each took three days to make by hand at the Glasgow School of Art.

Medallists also receive a shallow two-handled drinking cup, known as a quaich. Held aloft by Alistair Brownlee, they have been made from the wood of trees that have fallen in Glasgow parks.
