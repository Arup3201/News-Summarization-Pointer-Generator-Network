Former U.S. president Jimmy Carter believes he is being spied on and prefers to send a good old fashioned letter to world leaders instead of emails. 

The 89-year-old said it was likely that his emails are monitored by the National Security Agency.  

The Democrat said: 'As a matter of fact, you know, I have felt that my own communications are probably monitored.

'And when I want to communicate with a foreign leader privately, I type or write a letter myself, put it in the post office, and mail it,' he told NBC's Meet the Press.

He added: 'Because I believe if I send an email it will be monitored.'

Asked about disclosures of sweeping U.S. surveillance activities, Carter, who served as president from 1977 to 1981, said the practice 'has been extremely liberalised and, I think, abused by our own intelligence agencies.'

Since former employee Edward Snowden blew the whistle on the National Security Agency's surveillence programme last year, President Obama has proposed changes into how the agency collects its data. 

Snowden claims he tried 10 times to make formal complaints about government spy programmes but no-one listened to him.

Snowden previously worked for the CIA before joining the NSA in Hawaii as a contractor from Booz Allen Hamilton.

It was from there that he leaked information about the extent of NSA spying programs to the press before fleeing to Hong Kong and then seeking asylum in Russia.

Snowden said that no one wanted to be associated with any complaints at the NSA.

During the interview Carter also said that President Obama had noy asked for his advice on how to deal with Russia's annexing of Crimea.

When asked if he had been contacted by the president, Carter said: 'Unfortunately the answer is no. President Obama doesn't, but previous presidents have called on me.'
