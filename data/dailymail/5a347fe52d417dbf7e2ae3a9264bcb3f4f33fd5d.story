The photographer who last week shared photographs of Australian cricket legend Glenn McGrath posing with a gun beside the bodies of hunted animals, has revealed he has received countless death threats since Friday. 

Acclaimed wildlife photographer Christopher Rimmer, who is originally from South Africa, has spent much of his life shooting animals in the region - but always from behind the lens of a camera rather than the barrel of a gun.

Rimmer, who is currently based in Melbourne, posted the images of McGrath to his Facebook page last week, after they were sent to him by a friend. But he said the response online had been 'awful'.

'There’s no greater crime in Australia than exposing the shortcomings of a sportsman', he told Daily Mail Australia.

Wildlife photographer Christopher Rimmer (pictured) has told of the backlash he's received online following the publication of images of Glenn McGrath posing with dead animals

The series of photographs of the ex-cricketer posing next to dead African animals, emerged via Facebook on Friday

In the photographs - taken on a hunting trip in 2008 - McGrath is pictured holding a gun and smiling with his kill, including an elephant, water buffalo and hyenas.

'A friend of mine sent the photographs over saying that he thought that it was a famous cricket player,' Rimmer said.

'I was very suspicious of the photographs at first and I put them into my big editing suite to check if they had been photo-shopped.' he continued.

After determining the images had not been altered, he decided to post them online.

'In the end I thought the public interest was better served by showing them,' he said.

However Rimmer said the response from people online had been 'pretty awful,' and revealed that he had revealed numerous death threats from people whose Facebook pages were adorned with photographs of their children clutching dead animals.

'I knew given what I do and the people that follow me that I thought there would be a strong reaction but I never imagined it would be as intense as its been,' Rimmer revealed.

'Some of the language employed from people that are pro-wildlife has been pretty crazy really,' he said, adding that he didn't know whether the hunters or animal liberators had been worse.

'It's indicative of how extreme everything is these days.'

He said he had received over 400 personal messages through his website and Facebook page since he published the photographs, but had stopped reading them due to the atrocious many of them were.

Rimmer did emphasise that many people had been positive about the airing of the photos, and he presented them without comment on the original post.

'I put it out there and didn't tell people what to think of them', he said. 

When asked about his take on the sport of killing animals for the sake of it, Rimmer said although he didn't condone it, he also though McGrath chose a poor park to kill the African creatures.

'Personally I’m repulsed by the idea of killing an animal for pleasure,' he said.

'My main point is that Glenn McGrath should have done his research before he went to Zimbabwe.'

On the apology from the sports star, the photographer said: 'He came up with that apology pretty quickly, and it shows.'

Rimmer also described the invoking of McGrath's wife Jane's death in the actions were in poor taste. 

The photographer grew up in South Africa, and his upcoming exhibition features photographs from the area showcasing the incredible wildlife and landscape. 

At the weekend former Australian Test player Brett Lee was also dragged into the Glenn McGrath hunting controversy after an image of the pair posing with a dead animal emerged.

Daily Mail Australia has uncovered a photograph of the cricketers in the company of two young boys, smiling next to a bleeding deer.

Lee has one hand placed casually on the dead animal and the other around a child's shoulders.

A spokesman for the 38-year-old confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that 'yes, that photo was taken on a farm in South Africa'.

The new image comes just a day after McGrath attracted mass criticism for a series of images from a 2008 African hunting trip. 

In 2006, McGrath opened up about the hunting trips he has enjoyed on his New South Wales country property with Lee and fellow Australian bowler Jason Gillespie, in an interview with Australian Shooter.  

He explained that Lee enjoys hunting, whilst Gillespie was an amateur with firearms.  

McGrath is a life member with the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia and defended the practice in 2006, explaining that he sees it as a 'bonding' activity between himself and his mates.

'I don't expect people to feel the same way about [shooting], and at the same time, I don't expect others to force their opinions on me,' he told AS in 2006.

'I do have a passion for hunting and it is something I do want to continue once I've finished with cricket.'  

Social media users slammed the former cricketer on Twitter and Facebook

Some went as far as to announce they would boycott his cancer charity the McGrath Foundation 

However, McGrath issued a statement on Twitter soon after the images surfaced on Saturday, saying he 'deeply regretted' the experience. 

'In 2008 I participated in a hunting safari in Zimbabwe that was licensed and legal but in hindsight highly inappropriate,' McGrath wrote.

'It was an extremely difficult time in my life and looking back I deeply regret being involved'.

The 'difficult time' McGrath referred to in the statement is understood to be a reference to the death of his wife Jane McGrath, who died of Breast Cancer in June 2008.

She died at the age of 42, eleven years after she was diagnosed, after co-founding the McGrath Foundation with her husband.  

When the images emerged, the photograph of a beaming McGrath sitting in front of a dead elephant in Zimbabwe with a gun in his lap was considered particularly distressful amongst Twitter users. 

African elephants are classified as 'vulnerable' by animal welfare groups.

Dozens of Twitter users continue to express their disgust for the photos, with many also saying they would boycott the cancer charity

Twitter users continue to express their disgust for the photos, with many also saying they would boycott the cancer charity.

'Glenn McGrath game hunter. Yes, that's a dead elephant he's grinning about. Won't give any more $ to his foundation,' Kerry Glover wrote on the platform.

However, another Twitter user pointed out that the cancer patients would suffer greatly if charity was targeted. 

'We need to look at the foundation and Glenn McGrath as two separate identities... don't kill Jane's dream,' tweeted Vivienne. 

'Boycotting The McGrath Foundation and the women it helps is pathetic. Get a grip,' tweeted another.

User Sandy Lanceley wrote: 'Just lost an enormous amount of respect for @glennmcgrath11, hunting in Africa? Hang your head'.

The photos, which were originally posted to the Zimbabwean canned hunting group Chipitani Safari's website, have since been removed.

The Planet Ark ambassador has openly expressed his passion for hunting in the past during an interview with the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia. 

'I'm keen to get into trophy hunting, no animal in particular, but a big safari in Africa would be great,' he said.

'I'd prefer to do the safari on foot, like they did in the old days and just take the camp with you, not driving around in 4WDs.'

Now a cricket commentator and president of the McGrath Foundation, McGrath met his current wife Sara Leonardi during a trip to Cape Town in South Africa in 2009.

Planet Ark denied any association with the ex-cricketer today. 

'We have only been made aware of these activities today. We are deeply saddened by the deaths of these animals and in no way endorse or support this activity. Planet Ark does not have an ongoing association with Glenn McGrath.'
