Whether hunching shoulders come from years of sitting at a desk or - let's face it - laziness, few of us are strangers to bad posture.

Now a Parisian fashion firm hopes to turn that all around by bringing out a techy T-shirt which promises to help us stand tall again.

Clever elastic film bands sewn into the upper section of the top apply gentle pressure to 'remind' wearers that they need to stand with their shoulders back.

UpCouture's techy t-shirt promises to help us stand up straight again with the use of clever elastic film pieces sewn into the tops

Interestingly, the special film pieces are not tailored to follow the natural curves of the shoulders, and it took an 30 prototypes to reach the ideal Up T-Shirt pattern.

Paris-based firm UpCouture have created the Up T-shirt, which 'encourages the holding of the shoulders in a beautiful position, which results in a higher and more appealing profile'.

But beautiful posture won't come cheap. While it comes in different styles and designs for both men and women, one very basic Up T-Shirt comes in at £105 ($172).

The tops are designed to not only make wearers look more presentable but spare them from back problems through use of the innovative and patented set of elastic bands.

They are integrated into the t-shirt in a way that 'allows it to be comfortable and flexible'. Apparently the T-shirt is ‘most efficient when it is fitted' - so if you're undecided, go for a smaller size.

Four years ago in January 2010 designers saw a gap in the market for a fashion-forward, comfortable posture-perfecting T-shirt.

One of their first challenges was to create the correct balance of elastic forces. They looked to the anatomy for guidance and embarked on months of research and development.

Designers finally decided upon an extra-thin film
 with the perfect stress/strain ratio and 100 per cent recovery 
power. The material is both sown and bonded to the garment.

After designing a top featuring the ideal mix of forces for maximum efficiency and comfort, UpCouture patented their design and set up shop.

They now deliver to most of Europe, North America and rest of world.
