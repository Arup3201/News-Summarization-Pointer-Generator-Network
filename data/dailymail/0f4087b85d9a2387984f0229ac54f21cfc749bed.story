It's well known that dolphins have complex social lives and can express their emotions through sound and movement, but since the 1960s scientists have tried  to prove whether or not they have a language.

Now, a dolphin expert has used a specially-made underwater translator to understand the whistles of the intelligent underwater mammals.

Dr Denise Herzing claims she heard one of the creatures 'say' the word sargassum, a type of seaweed, when she was swimming in the Caribbean last August.

The Cetacean Hearing and Telemetry (Chat) is an underwater keyboard that has four symbols which each corresponded to a specific sound and a toy.

Currently only a prototype, Chat is fitted to the arm of a diver who activates a sound using the device.

The sound goes out through an underwater speaker, letting the dolphin know which toy to pick up.

If a dolphin mimics the whistle or a human plays the whistle, the sounds come in and are localised by two hydrophones.

The technology can detect the dolphins' natural sounds, letting the human diver who is wearing the device know which call is being made and what it means.

It was the first time that a prototype dolphin translator called Cetacean Hearing and Telemetry (Chat) has managed to translate a dolphin whistle.

‘I was like whoa! We have a match. I was stunned,’ the founder of the Wild Dolphin Project, based in Florida, told New Scientist.

The machine detected a whistling sound for sargassum which Dr Herzing had invented when she was playing with the dolphin pod that she has studied for the last 25 years.

Her team hoped the animals would continue to use the whistles, which are quite different to the noises they naturally make.

When the dolphin 'said' sargassum, Dr Herzing heard her own voice because the machine translated the unique whistle as 'sargassum'.

It is not known whether the dolphin said the word because it saw some of the seaweed and was trying to communicate with another a dolphin.

So far the sargassum whistle has been heard just once.

The Chat system was built for Denise Herzing by Thad Starner at the Georgia Institute of Technology, who also engineered Google Glass and uses pattern-discovery algorithms designed to analyse the invented whistles.

The team hopes that the system will also reveal what the dolphin’s natural communication means.

Dr Herzing and Dr Starner will present their findings on dolphin communication May at the speech and signal processing conference in Florence, Italy.

They have managed to pinpoint eight different characteristics in 73 different whistles, matching them with mother-calf interactions and hope to confirm two-way communication between humans and dolphins this summer.

The Chat prototype can be seen here fitted to the arm of a diver who activates a sound using the device. The sound goes out through an underwater speaker, letting the dolphin know which toy to pick up and can also be used to decode the dolphins' responses

Describing the underwater Chat keyboard in a Ted talk, Dr Herzing explained that it has four symbols which each corresponded to a specific 
sound and a toy. It is fitted to the arm of a diver who activates a sound using the device.

The sounds go out through an underwater 
speaker, letting the dolphin know which toy to pick up and if a dolphin mimics the whistle or a human plays the whistle, 
the sounds come in and are localised by two hydrophones.

The technology can detect the dolphins' 
natural sounds, letting the human diver who is wearing the device know 
which call is being made and what it means.
