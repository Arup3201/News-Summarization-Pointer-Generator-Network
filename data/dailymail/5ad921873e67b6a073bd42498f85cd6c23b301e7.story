Mayfair on the Monopoly board may be worth only £400, but with soaring house prices the reality today is eye-wateringly different.

A four-storey townhouse in the exclusive London area now sells for £40million, while even a flat in the cheapest Monopoly area of Whitechapel has gone for nearly £5million.

In light of such ludicrous prices, one estate agent has now re-imagined the classic board game – set in desirable English market towns.

The new Mayfair is picturesque Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire, where homes go for more than £872,000 on average. Petworth, in the South Downs National Park in West Sussex, is the second most exclusive town on the board, taking the place of Park Lane.

Old Kent Road and Whitechapel Road – both worth £60 and often seen as the game’s dud streets unless you can build a hotel on them – have been replaced by Morpeth and Wooler in Northumberland, where average houses sell for about £220,000.

Upmarket estate agent Savills has also reinvented Bond Street, Regent Street and Oxford Street as Harpenden, Berkhamsted, and Bushey, all in Hertfordshire, where family homes routinely sell for more than £500,000.

Piccadilly, Leicester Square and Coventry Street, priced at between £260 and £280, become Salcombe in Devon, and Chipping Campden and Northleach in the Cotswolds.

At the slightly cheaper end, Ilkley in West Yorkshire becomes the new Northumberland Avenue, nearby Wetherby replaces Pall Mall, and Poynton in Cheshire is £120 Pentonville Road.

Lucian Cook, of Savills, said: ‘We looked for towns with the highest average value across different regions of the UK.’

The current version of Monopoly was printed by Parker Brothers in 1935, although earlier versions date back to 1904.
