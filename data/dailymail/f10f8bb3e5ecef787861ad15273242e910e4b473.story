This trio of furry bikers likes nothing more than to feel the wind in their ears.

So whenever Mary Mayhead hits the open road in her Moto Guzzi motorcycle, she brings her three pet dogs along for the ride.

Alsatians Mari, Kiri and Hine have even been kitted out with their own goggles - or 'doggles' - for their trips along Australia's Sunshine Coast in their owner's sidecar.

'When I bring out the bike, they 
run into it,' said Ms Mayhead, a dog trainer.

'Kiri usually claims the best spot at the front so she can 
get the wind in her face without the other two blocking it.

'They go everywhere with us.

'The rule is when they have their doggles on
they have to sit quietly but when they come off they can get out and 
have a run,' she said.
