These are the stunning aerial images that appear to show an 'underwater vortex' in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Mauritius.

But despite the appearance of an underwater waterfall along the coast of the tropical island, it is really an optical illusion.

The illusion of the dramatic vortex has been created by a run-off of sand and silt deposits.

The optical illusion, off the south-west tip of the island, can be seen from a bird's eye view and is even present on Google maps.

The island nation of Mauritius was first discovered by Arabic explorers and has since been colonised by the Portuguese, French, British and Dutch.

Mauritius, which lies off the coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean, became independent in 1968 and a republic in 1992.
