Some wear GPS devices that are constantly monitored by police.

Others have fled their homes; repudiated by the local community for being a registered sex offender.

And all of them - from those charged with possessing child pornography to ones caught having sex with a minor and molestation - are there to 'repent their sins'.

Welcome to Miracle Village, a tiny church town spanning about 20 acres on the edge of Everglades in south Florida, which was established in 2009 as a spiritual safe haven for sex offenders and their families.

With a population of about 200, it is believed to be the largest sex offender community in the United States.

Spiritual safe haven: Set in the sugarcane country of south Florida, Miracle Village is a tiny town of bungalow-style houses where about 200 sex offenders and their families co-exist

Tight-knit community:  The village was originally constructed for laborers who worked in the surrounding sugarcane fields, and was transformed in 2009 by the late evangelical pastor Dick Witherow, a former sex offender himself

United: The tiny community has provided a home for registered sex offenders, who struggle to find housing in Florida because they cannot come within at least 1,000 feet of children, or risk being sent to prison

Parish: Miracle Village is an intensely religious community, who welcome sex offenders based on the belief they will repent their sins

Co-existing: Many of the women who live in the town are the wives of offenders, however there is at least one female sex offender among the population of about 200

Brooklyn-based photographer Noah Rabinowitz has captured a fascinating inside look at the town, which is surrounded by sugarcane fields and was built in the 1960s to house workers.

He spent three days taking pictures and talking with the residents who gave him permission.

'There are no violent criminals in the town, [which is] a strict guideline to admission,' Rabinowitz told Feature Shoot.

'It is a deeply religious, tight knit and strictly self-governed community.'

'I wanted to treat the offenders and non-offenders in the same manner and instead think about the town as an example of a self-governed community built around common experience, whatever that might be.'

While the town looks and sounds like a colony of outcasts with no other option, it is actually a highly sought-after place to live.

Finding housing as a sex offender in Florida is almost impossible, with state laws forbidding them to go within 1,000 feet of schools, playgrounds, parks or any other place there might be children.

Different cities and counties have increased that distance to 2,500, or half a mile.

Additionally, a lot of offenders come out of prison with little to no money.

'Application numbers are very high and admission, based on a voting system, is very selective,' Rabinowitz said.

'Moral and ethical judgments aside, the residents are trying to live out their American Dream, in the only way the law and society will allow.

'Some discuss their hopes for life after their time in Miracle Village, but many find it to be a safe place and wish to stay.'

Post-prison: The bungalow community offers sex offenders a place to live with their families without judgement

Unbiased: Photographer Noah Rabinowitz said he aimed to document a community that was self-governed, not what brought the people there

Home: The residents of Miracle Village greatly vary in both age and circumstance

Studies: Miracle Village offers classes, such as sexual purity and anger management, as well as psychological treatment programs

Familial: A few children do live at Miracle Village. Florida's laws don't stop sex offenders from living in the same neighbourhood as minors, but probation conditions often prevent them having any contact with them

Shunned: Most of the people who live in the colony have been turned away from their homes following their convictions

Regular meetings: There are classes available that give counsel for sexual purity, anger management and other issues

Self-governed: While all the villagers chip in to help, such as maintaining the grounds, some have jobs in nearby towns

Simple: All the homes are more or less the same size and style

Distance: Surround by sugarcane fields, farmers in the background can be seen burning off the extraneous leaves around their crop

Farmland: Miracle Village looks an island in the middle of a sugarcane oasis

Miracle Village was set up by the late evangelical pastor Dick Witherow, according to ABC News.

Witherow came close to being charged with statutory rape as a 18-year-old after getting his 14-year-old girlfriend pregnant.

He would teach a sexual purity to those living there each week.

There are also anger management and bible study classes.

Most of the sex offenders are required to attended psychological treatment programs as part of the conidtions of their probation.

Others have jobs in the surrounding towns, the nearest of which is two miles away.

Many nearby residents relocated after Miracle Village was founded, and a bus stop that was out front of the village entrance was moved so no children would come near the community.Â 

Modest: Almost all the bungalow-style houses date back to the 1960's, when the tiny town was first built

Rudimentary: A self-made clothesline pictured at Miracle Village in south Florida

Commonality: Everyone in the religious community know each other and often socialize together

Going about their lives: Half of the residents are registered sex offenders, while the other half are spouses and family members

Supportive: The people work together to manage the grounds and help each other

Roots: The village was built on religion and centered around the church
