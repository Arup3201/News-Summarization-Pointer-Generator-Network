New Zealand Prime Minister John Key says he wants to ditch the Union Flag from his country's national flag and replace it with the silver fern, hinting at the possibility of a referendum on the issue as early as this year.

Mr Key said he was planning to discuss the matter with senior ministers adding he would personally like to see a new flag using a symbol drawn from New Zealand's native flora.

He said: 'My own personal view is that the silver fern is the right way to go. In my view, the silver fern is something which is applied to our greatest sporting teams.

'It has international recognition and cachet. I think it's part of the modern new look of New Zealand.'

Mr Key said he believed the country was split 50-50 on the subject.

If a referendum was to be held, the 
public would likely be offered a choice of the current flag or a 
government-chosen alternative.

New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said he favours a switch to the silver fern

'We have to make it simple,' Mr Key added.

Debate over whether New Zealand should change its flag has been raging since the early 1970s.

Many
 Kiwis argue that their country's ensign is too similar to that of 
Australia. Both country's flags have the Union flag in the left hand 
corner  and are adorned by stars.    

Others 
believe having the Union Flag as part of their flag rings of British 
imperialism and makes New Zealand look like a colony.   

Among those that want to see the flag changed there is much debate over what its replacement should look like.

Labour
 Party deputy leader David Parker said he supports a change to a red, 
white and blue incorporating both Maori and colonial influences.

The
 current flag dates from 1865, when the British Government insisted 
colonial ships use the Blue ensign - a blue flag with the Union Jack in 
the top left corner.

In 
1869, the southern cross was added by order of the then Governor Sir 
George Bowen. The constellation can only be seen in the Southern 
Hemisphere.

It was approved as the national flag by King Edward VII in 1902.

However
 many servicemen are expected to oppose the idea on the grounds that New
 Zealanders have fought and died under the colours and to change it 
would be disrespectful, especially in the centenary of the outbreak of 
World War I.

John Banks, leader of the Act Party, and an important political ally of Mr Key, told the New Zealand Herald: 'Men fought under that flag and sacrificed their lives in many war campaigns and, for me, I'm a bit old-fashioned.

'I don't want the name of the country changed, the flag changed, and God save the Queen.'
