The best friend of the alleged Vanderbilt gang-rape victim took the stand Wednesday to describe her then-roommate's distressing appearance the morning after the attack is said to have occurred. 

Four former Vanderbilt football players are currently on trial for raping a woman repeatedly while she was unconscious on June 23, 2013, including the victim's then-boyfriend Brandon Vandenburg. 

Lauren Miller went to a bar with the victim the night leading up to the attack, and told the court her reaction the next time she saw her friend the following morning.

She says her roommate came back to their condo with a gash on her leg, looking ill and 'out of it'. 

'My immediate reaction was "Woah, what happened to you?"' Miller recalled.

Shocking: The former roommate of the alleged Vanderbilt rape victim took the stand on Wednesday to describe what she looked like the morning after the attack 

She said her roommate's makeup was a mess, she was missing a shoe and her hair was unkempt

'So just from a physical standpoint, starting from top to bottom, her makeup was completely disheveled, the one thing I very clearly remember was the state of her hair. She had had it curled the night before and I remember being like, "Did you go jump in a pool?"'

She says she also found her roommate's black heel on the lawn outside their condo, and later overheard a voicemail  message left by Vandenburg which her friend played on speaker.

'I heard him talking to (the woman) and saying he had just gotten out of football meeting, and he was being accused of some very horrible things that he did not do,' Miller recalled. 'And he was telling (the woman) to not believe anything she heard.' 

The alleged victim has no memory of the attack. 

Vandenburg and former teammates Cory Batey, Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie and Brandon Banks face five counts of aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual battery. Vandenburg faces an additional charge of tampering with evidence and unlawful photography.

Two other former Vanderbilt athletes took the stand as well on Wednesday to give their witness accounts of the event. 

Then Vanderbilt tennis player Michael Retta and football player Dillon Van Der Wal told the jury that they saw the victim lying outside of Vandenburg's room that morning but neither reported the incident to police at the time. 

They both gave conflicting reports about whether Vandenburg asked for help moving the girl to his bed.

Retta says he saw the alleged victim naked in the morning hours of June 23, while Van Der Wall said he saw the woman with 'handprints on her buttocks'. 

He also described Vandenburg's emotions that morning, saying he was 'extremely fidgety,' 'not acting normal,' and pacing. 

Previous witness allege the woman was urinated on and assaulted with a water bottle during the videotaped incident. 

Seventeen of the 23 witnesses prosecutors have called to testify have yet to take the stand. The trial was expected to last 10 days but is now nearing its third week.
