Topping hitlist: TV reality star Kim Kardashian was the most searched-for celebrity of 2011

It's the all-encompassing litmus test that determines what's top and what's a flop in our digital society.

Today, Google reveals its annual zeitgeist - the people, places and things that are clicking the most with UK internet users in 2011.

Top of the most-searched celebrities is US reality star Kim Kardashian, whose profile was boosted further this year after marrying and then divorcing basketball player Kris Humphries in just three months.

She rose to fame after appearing in reality show Keeping Up with the Kardashians which launched in 2007 and follows the personal and professional lives of members of her family.

Next behind her was Victoria Beckham, who gave birth to her and husband David's first daughter, Harper Seven, in July, followed by Harry Potter actress Emma Watson in third.

Singer Amy Winehouse, who died earlier this year in tragic circumstances, comes in fifth.

Ricky Gervais, undoubtedly buoyed by his notorious appearance as MC for the Golden Globes, was the only male to make into the top ten.

The search giant also revealed the year's fastest-rising searches which was topped by a country mile by the Royal Wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, who also featured in the top ten fasting-rising people section.

The Royal Wedding was followed by the iPhone 5 and popular football computer game Fifa 12, revealing just how technology obsessed the world has become.

Another American reality TV star, the late Ryan Dunn of Jackass fame, who died in a car crash, was the fastest-rising person ahead of singer Adele, while Breaking Dawn leads the fastest-rising movies list.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, X Factor hit number 1 in the TV shows chart.

Top searches in the UK were made up of Facebook, Hotmail, You Tube and eBay. Argos also made the list.

There is also a list of the most 
popular 'what is...' searches, in which AV - the Alternative Vote - 
clearly baffled electors the most.

Almost 20 million people took part in 
the national referendum on the electoral system this year which saw two 
thirds vote to keep the first-past-the-post system to elect MPs.

This was followed, bizarrely, by people curious to know about 
scampi, piles and truffles.

However, searches for Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg declined faster than X-Factor winner Joe Mcelderry who has been dropped by his record label, and singer Alexandra Burke.

Joyous occasion: The wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton was the fastest-rising search term on Google this year

Also revealed are the fastest rising travel destinations, sports terms, news, food and drink, music and top TV searches.

Las Vegas topped the list for the most searched travel destination, followed by New York and Disneyland Paris in second place.

Meanwhile, Asda was the most Googled food shop followed by 'recipes' in second place.

Google revealed today WHAT web users are searching for - but where do they go next? The top-ranked news site which British Google users visit next is Mail Online.

In fact, Mail Online is ranked in the top three 'destination' sites for news, TV and celebrities - all judged by where people go after Google searches, according to data from search experts Hitwise.

Other British national newspapers failed to make the top ten - except for TV, where the Daily Mirror was placed tenth.

No other online news outlets or TV channel sites made the top three in any of these categories. In searches for TV shows, Mail Online was second - just after the official X Factor site.

Train tickets topped the most as the most searched ticket, with cheap tickets and 2012 tickets in second and third place.

The
 Google zeitgeist list - meaning spirit of the times - is compiled from 
the searches through Google each year. Individual searchers are not 
identified.

It's become an annual event for the company - and has quickly been mirrored by social sites such as Facebook and Twitter, both of which share their own 'Top Ten' most shared around Christmas every year.

Google hosts a year-round Zeitgeist page that lets users monitor search terms' popularity over time.

Paul Allen, 
editor of Computeractive magazine, told Metro: 'It’s slightly depressing
 to see some of the kind of basic searches that are going on there, 
particularly 'what is scampi''.

‘It’s
 also slightly worrying that young people will go to Google as the first
 authority, the first step to any kind of piece of information,’ he 
added.

A Google 
spokesman said: ‘As usual, search is helping people satisfy their 
appetite for celebrity pictures and gossip – and this year is 
no different, with Kim Kardashian and Rebecca Black coming to the fore.

'But
 what we’re also seeing is that people are turning to Google to 
understand complex subjects like the alternative vote system and 
searching for tips and tricks on how best to revise for exams.’
