This is the seemingly inconspicuous Liverpool house where one of Merseysides most notorious crime families ran a global drug-dealing network.

The images from inside the former home of the Fitzgibbon clan has emerged as two members of the family face losing their multi-million pound fortune after being jailed for their part in an international heroin deal.

Jason and Ian Fitzgibbon were sentenced to a combined 30 years in 2013 for their part in a £7million plot to smuggle high-strength heroin from Turkey to Merseyside.

It has been estimated that Jason, 42, and Ian, 41, made £3.2million from their lives of crime before they were caught, the National Crime Agency says.

The Fitzgibbon family, whose violent exploits and feuds with rivals stretch back decades on Merseyside, were described as 'tier one criminals at the top of their game' before an 18-month undercover operation led to their arrest in 2013. 

The brothers, from Liverpool and Merseyside, were caught on tape boasting of their lavish lifestyle and arguing which one was the better drug dealer.

The tapes, used during the 2013 court case against them, saw Jason boast he was ‘ten times better’ at being a gangster than his younger brother while singing along to the Jessie J song ‘Price Tag’.

A judge at Manchester Crown Court is ruling on how much they made from crime and how much they will have to pay back.

Ian Fitzgibbon was supported in court by Desperate Scousewives star Amanda Harrington,and the convicted drug-dealer kissed the socialite on the cheek before he was led back to his cell.

Yesterday, their mother, Christine Fitzgibbon, was told to pay back more than £120,000 in ill-gotten gains - or face more than two-and-a-half years in prison.

The 62-year-old was said to have made £280,000 by laundering money made from her sons' drug dealing, and was jailed for two years.

A Rolex watch, cash in a bank account and £1,000 cash will go towards footing the bill - as will the sale of the family home in Mossley Hill, in which she has equity.

Jason and Ian were jailed for 14-and-a-half and 16 years respectively at Manchester Crown Court in June 2013 over their plan to import 57kg of heroin from Turkey.

Intelligence from England to the Turkish police stopped the deal in its tracks and on September 26, 2011 five local drug traffickers were rounded up.

In the boot of a car officers discovered 114 half kilo packs of heroin wrapped in brown tape. The aftermath of the failed drug deal in Turkey was recorded in part by a covert listening device.

Ian Fitzgibbon was later recorded remarking: 'That's the story of Jason's life, that Turkey thing.'

Ian also admitted an £800k plot to flood Merseyside with 168,000 ecstasy tablets, for which his sidekick Danny Smith, of Warren Road, Blundellsands, Merseyside, was jailed for 10 years.

The Fitzgibbon brothers dispute the amount of money they are said to have made and claim they have few assets available to seize.

The case continues.
