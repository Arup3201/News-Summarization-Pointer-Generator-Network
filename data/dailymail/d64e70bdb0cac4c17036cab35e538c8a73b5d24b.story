Hundreds of thousands more union members will be able to play a more active role due to Ed Miliband's reforms, McCluskey has said

Union baron Len McCluskey yesterday hailed Ed Miliband’s reforms to Labour’s links with the trade unions as ‘music to my ears’.

The Unite general secretary, whose union has given Labour more than £8 million since Mr Miliband became leader, said they would allow potentially hundreds of thousands more union members to ‘play a more active role’.

Labour HQ insists its plans to change the way the party elects its leaders and takes money from the unions is Mr Miliband’s ‘Clause Four moment’, a reference to when Tony Blair changed its constitution.

Deputy leader Harriet Harman insisted that allowing union members to pay £3 to affiliate to Labour and then vote in the leadership elections would ‘breathe fresh life’ into the party.

She accused critics of being ‘phobic’ about trade union, telling the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme: ‘What it’s about is opening up the Labour party to people at workplaces up and down the country, broadening the base of the Labour party.

‘I don’t know what you mean about ‘a trade union direction’; if you mean people who care about more people being able to get jobs, being able to have the living wage, caring about decent terms and conditions, caring about equality and social justice, well yes, that’s a good thing, that’s what the Labour party believes in.’

Mr Miliband says he wants to ‘mend, not end’ Labour’s link to the unions, and asked former trade unionist and Labour general secretary to draw up proposals that will be discussed this week by the party’s ruling body.

Individual members of an affiliated trade union  will be given a straight ‘yes or no’ choice about whether they want to pay a small sum that will be given to Labour.

Those that want to pay this fee will also be asked if they wish - at no extra cost - to become an ‘affiliated supporter’ who has a direct relationship with the party as an individual.

Mr Miliband said: ‘This is about completing unfinished business from the past 20 years and creating a One Nation Labour Party built on the principle of one member, one vote.

‘And it is about letting the people back into our politics: giving people a real choice and a real voice in our party; changing Labour so that Labour can change our country.’

The Tories - and some Labour critics -- say the changes will make it easier for union members to determine Labour leadership contests, greatly increasing the number who can vote and diluting the power of Labour MPs over the outcome.

Mr Miliband - whose received £8m from Unite since he became leader of the party - says he wants to ¿mend, not end¿ Labour¿s link to the unions

They also warn that giving individuals a choice over whether or not to pay affiliation fees means more cash will acculumate in unions’ political funds, which leaders can then choose whether or not to hand to the party.

Mr McCluskey told BBC Radio Five’s Pienaar’s Politics: ‘For me it wasn’t necessarily a question of gaining or losing power when Ed [Miliband] made his statement back in the summer of last year. He was talking about giving an opportunity to ordinary trade unionists – maybe hundreds of thousands - to play a more active role within the Labour party. That was music to my ears, which is why we welcome the proposals.’

Paul Kenny, head of the GMB union, told the BBC’s Sunday Politics, said the proposed changes to leadership elections were ‘very sensible’ and the perception of a union ‘bloc vote’ has always been a myth.

Professor Roger Seafert, a trade union expert, said: ‘It is not clear that Miliband believes that this change will reduce union influence. It just changes the nature of that influence. But fundamentally those people who pay the bills, the unions, will still have a big say in party policy.’

Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Ed Miliband promised to loosen the trade union barons’ grip on the Labour Party. But he has been too weak to deliver.

‘Until now, the union barons could buy Labour’s policies and pick Labour’s leader. After these changes, it will be even easier for the union barons to buy Labour’s policies and even easier to pick the leader. And Ed Miliband has done nothing that would stop the unions fixing Labour’s candidate selections.’
