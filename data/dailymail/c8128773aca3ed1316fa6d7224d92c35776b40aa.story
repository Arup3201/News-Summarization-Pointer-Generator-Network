This is the dramatic moment that a quiet residential street resembled a scene from Independence Day when this eerie cloud formation appeared.

The 1996 blockbuster saw Will Smith team up with Jeff Goldblum to fight an alien invasion.

In one of the sci-fi film's best-known scenes, the alien spaceships appear for the first time by passing through the clouds - and the Bristol skyline looked remarkably similar on Tuesday evening, as the sun began to set behind a long line of clouds.

This still from the sci-fi blockbuster shows an enormous spacecraft materialising from the clouds to herald the beginning of the film's intergalactic conflict

Alex Trott, 29, an urban designer who lives in Kingswood, Bristol, captured the amazing sight.

He said: 'My dog Betsy was barking like mad so I looked out the window and couldn’t believe my eyes.

'It was like a scene out of Independence 
Day. Germany had just scored again but I didn’t care, I just had to run 
upstairs and get a better look. I’ve never seen anything like it.'

The Met Office said the brooding skyline was caused by the contrast in light as the setting sun lit up one side of the cloud while there were showers on the other side

Photographer Alex Trott said that he 'couldn't believe his eyes' upon witnessing the sight of the eerie cloud formation in skies above Bristol

A spokesperson for the Met Office said: 'This is a bank of stratocumulus cloud which has been highlighted by the contrast in light between the setting sun illuminating one side, and the showers behind the cloud.

'This is a totally normal cloud formation but has been made to look more dramatic by the light.'
