The killer who dressed as an Afghan policeman and slaughtered two British soldiers had pretended to be injured so they would help him, defence sources revealed tonight.

He lured the men from 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment to their deaths at a checkpoint in the Nahri Sarraj district of Helmand province in southern Afghanistan after faking an injury, sources said.

The deaths follow that of Lance Corporal Duane Groom, 32, from 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, who died on Friday after the Fiji-born soldier's vehicle hit a roadside bomb, also in Nahri Sarraj.

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said an 
investigation was under way into the circumstances of the latest soldiers' 
deaths and could not comment. The soldiers’ next of kin have been 
informed.

An MoD spokeswoman said: ‘It is with 
sadness that the Ministry of Defence must announce the death of two 
soldiers from 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment on Saturday September
15 2012.

‘The soldiers were shot and killed by a
man wearing the uniform of the Afghan local police at a checkpoint in 
the south of Nahr-e Saraj district, Helmand province.’

Major Laurence Roche, of Task Force Helmand, said the Yorkshire Regiment ‘suffered a deep loss’.

He added last night: ‘Everyone serving
within Task Force Helmand will want to send our condolences to the 
soldiers' families and loved ones at this time.’

Other fatality: Lance Corporal Duane Groom, 32, from 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, died on Friday after his vehicle hit a roadside bomb

Lance Corporal Groom - the soldier who died on Friday - was 
killed when his vehicle hit an improvised explosive device. The MoD said
the deaths were unrelated to the attack at Camp Bastion which killed 
two US Marines.

Those attackers had automatic rifles, 
rocket-propelled grenade launchers and suicide vests. Besides destroying
six Harrier jets, they demolished three refuelling stations and damaged six 
aircraft hangars.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for
that attack, saying it wanted to avenge Muslims insulted by an 
amateurish film that mocked the Prophet Muhammad - and because Prince 
Harry is on the base.

The Prince, who turned 28 on Saturday,
is set to start flying Apache missions this week, and his deployment is
not planned to be shortened after the attack. This is his second tour 
in Afghanistan.

The latest deaths bring the number of 
members of UK forces to have died since operations began in Afghanistan 
in October 2001 to 430.

They came during a bloody few days in the 
war-torn country.

At least one Afghan police officer 
turned his gun on Nato troops at a remote checkpoint in the south today, killing four US service members before escaping, Afghan and 
international officials said.
