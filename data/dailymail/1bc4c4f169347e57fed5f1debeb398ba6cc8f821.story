Glamour: Lola Karimova-Tillyaeva pictured at the Cannes Film Festival

Both sisters would look at home in a 
James Bond film - both are wealthy, glamorous, and the daughter of a 
central Asian dictator.

But
Lola, the 35-year-old younger daughter of Islam Karimov, has revealed 
in her first in her first interview with Western media that she and her 
elder sister Gulnara hate each other. 

Lola
Karimova-Tillyaeva, Uzbekistan's permanent representative at Unesco in 
Paris, agreed to take part in an interview with the BBC Uzbek Service 
carried out by email.

Lola has tended to avoid the media since she attempted to sue a French website that called her a 'dictator's daughter' in 2011. Human rights activists testified at the trial and the case was thrown out.  

Lola is based in Geneva, is Uzbekistan's ambassador to Unesco in Paris, and lives in a mansion that reportedly cost £29m.

She said that she had not spoken to her ambitious older sister, Gulnara, for 12 years. She went further, saying she ensured her two or three visits to Uzbekistan per year do not coincide with the times Gulnara will be there.

'We have never hidden this from anyone ... We have neither family nor friendship contacts,' she said. 'We don't even meet each other for family activities.'

Gulnara, 41, who is seen as a possible presidential successor, is known as a pop singer and fashion designer and runs jewellery and cosmetics businesses and number of charities.

Last year as her alter-ego GooGoosha, she recorded a duet with Gerard Depardieu, Until recently she was Uzbekistan's permanent representative in the UN in Geneva and the country's ambassador in Spain.

However, there are plenty of similarities between the two: both lead jet-set lifestyles, hob-nob with Western celebrities and pride themselves on their generous philanthropic endeavours.

Lola and her husband Timur have been included in a list of Swizterland's wealthiest people - and so has Gulnara.

But it seems that rivalry and resentment trump sisterly loyalty. 'Any good relationship requires a similarity of outlook or likeness of character,' said Lola.

'There is nothing like that in our relationship, has never been and is not now.' She said she and her sister had had quite different characters since childhood.'And these differences, as you know, only grow over the years.' 

This is not merely a family squabble. Their father is 75 and rumours have begun to swirl around the question of his succeessor. Karimov has ruled the country since it declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 with such an iron grip that there are no major high-profile politicians waiting in the wings.

Gulnara has long been tipped as a possible successor, but she is deeply unpopular in Uzbekistan. A US diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks referred to her as 'the single most hated person in the country'.

The Harvard graduate has been given diplomatic status by her father, and according to the memos sent to Washington, seen as a 'robber baron'.

Lola was no politician and wanted to focus on her family. But she told the BBC she thought Gulnara's chances of succeeding their father are 'slim'.

It may be that Lola is publicly distancing herself from her sister because Gulnara has been linked to a wide-ranging international fraud investigations. Critics claim she runs a huge business empire in Uzbekistan. Gulnara has denied all wrongdoing. 

Lola told the BBC that she does not know whether her father is aware of the allegations surrounding her sister's business interests, ebcause she and her father never discuss politics.

Asked why she sued the French news site, Rue89, Lola said that it hurts her when the media referred to her only as a 'dictator's daughter'.'I want to be seen as a person with her own principles and viewpoint,' she said.  

On the question of her father's policies, she said she agreed with his view that radicalisation of the population was largely due to unemployment and lack of opportunity. Karimov has been accused of using the pretext of combating Islamic extremism to quash all dissent. 

She said: 'And I am confident they cannot be solved by using force.' 

Karimov is accused of sanctioning his henchmen to slaughter hundreds of his own citizens at a massacre in the city of Andijan in 2005, though western leaders have courted him due to his country's proximity to Afghanistan. 

Human rights activists say he has had opponents boiled alive, and torture is widespread in the country's prisons.

Karimov said in a television interview in June that Uzbeks who went to Russia to look for work were 'lazy', and said he felt 'disgusted that people go there for a slice of bread'.

Average annual income in Uzbekistan is just £1,063, and the US estimates that around one in four Uzbeks works abroad because of a lack of work closer to home. Her father has been accused of forcing Uzbeks, even minors, to spend their summers picking cotton for little or no pay.

In her email interview she appeared to criticise this practice. 'I am against any exploitation, especially the exploitation of children,' she said.

Curiously, despite Lola's claim that she and her sister have not spoken for 12 years, another leaked US cable suggests that only nine years ago the two partied together in the capital, Tashkent, where Lola reportedly owned a nightclub.

'[Lola] Karimova typically arrives in her – one-of-a-kind, for Tashkent – Porsche Cayenne S sports utility vehicle around 10 o'clock for the traditional floorshow and stays until the wee hours dancing the night away in the raucous disco.

'On occasion, her older sister, Gulnora, joins her around three o'clock in the morning,' the cable says.
