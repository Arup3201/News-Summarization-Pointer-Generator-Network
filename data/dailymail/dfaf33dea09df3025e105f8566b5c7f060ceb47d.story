You have reluctantly dragged yourself out of bed, avoided rush hour traffic and made it into work on time. 

Just as it seems as if you are on to a rare, not-so-bad Monday morning, a colleague turns to you and asks: 'So, what did you get up to this weekend?' 

When asked this question, one in three British workers feel compelled to lie to make themselves seem more interesting, a new study has revealed.

Don't even ask: One in three workers suffer from 'weekendvy', compelling them to lie to colleagues about what they got up to at the weekend (picture posed by model)

A third of workers suffer from 'weekendvy' - where they are economical with the truth so they appear as adventurous as their colleagues.

The study, commissioned by Travelodge, asked 3,000 adults across the UK what they told workmates when they were asked how their weekend was.

The pressure of seeming like a fun-loving person leads thousands to lie about what they did, with the most popular mistruth being that they went out on the town on a Saturday night.

Other top lies include dining at a top restaurant, going on a romantic holiday in the UK, or going on a training course.

The secret competition between colleagues appears to be a vicious circle, however, with almost three-quarters of adults believing that they are having less weekend fun than others.

Psychologist Corinne Sweet  said: 'The psychological condition, ‘Weekendvy’ that’s currently hitting Britain is to do with needing to feel like an alpha male or female with high status.

'We don’t want to admit that most of our weekend time is spent trying to catch up with housework, paperwork and endless chores. 

'It’s the horrible feeling that everyone else is having a better time than us, going away, partying or having fun.'

I'm fun really: Workers tell the lies so they appear more interesting in the eyes of their colleagues, the most popular lie being that they went out on the town on Saturday night (picture posed by model) 

1) Painted the town red on Saturday night with their partner or friends.

2) Took part in an adventurous activity.

3) Went on a course or training programme. 

4) Went out for a fancy dinner at a top restaurant.

5) Took a romantic break in the UK (but actually just re-told a story of a previous holiday.
