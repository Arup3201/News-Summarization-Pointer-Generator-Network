A male actor and TV host has the unlikely talent of being able to embody a host of female celebrities, including Beyonce, Miley Cyrus or Taylor Swift.

Paolo Ballesteros, 31, from the Philippines uses make-up, wigs and coloured contact lenses to painstakingly recreate famous female features.

He can spend several hours creating each uncanny likeness, then posts the evidence on his Instagram account @pochoy_29 for his 360,000 followers to admire.

Paolo's transformations have also included Jennifer Lawrence, Katy Perry, Rihanna and Princess Diana. But he says his favourites are Angelina Jolie and Mariah Carey.

Speaking to Pep website, Paolo, who presents a daytime variety show called Eat Bulaga, explains: 'Angelina is very easy to do. I put big lips and I look like her already. But my favourite is Mariah Carey. I find it funny, with the character I do on Eat Bulaga.

'With Angelina, she is beautiful, but Mariah performs. I do something that I just kind of whistle. So that is why she is my favourite.'

Paolo suffered a mild stroke last September, but he used the time convalescing to create more incredible make-up transformations.

The former teen heartthrob actor has portrayed gay characters on TV but is cryptic about his own sexuality. 

In a 2013 interview with The Philippine Star he said: 'I'm not hiding anything. What you see is what you get. Now if you're asking if I'm gay, I'll say no. It's up to you to be confused.' 

He has one daughter with ex-girlfriend Kaye Nevada.
