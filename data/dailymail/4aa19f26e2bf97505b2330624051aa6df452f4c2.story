U.S. Justice Department
officials are unlikely to bring civil rights charges against a
white Ferguson, Missouri, police officer who shot black teenager Michael Brown, reports suggest. 

The Washington Post said
investigators had all but concluded there was not a sufficiently
strong case to prove  Darren Wilson violated the rights
of the 18-year-old when he killed him on August 9.

At issue is whether Wilson had reason to believe he was in
danger in his confrontation with Brown after he had asked the youngster to get out of the middle of a street.

Controversial: Reports have said investigators at the U.S. Justice Department have all but concluded there was not a sufficiently strong case to prove Darren Wilson violated the rights of the 18-year-old

Decision: At issue is whether Wilson had reason to believe he was indanger in his confrontation with Brown after he had asked the youngster to get out of the middle of a street (pictured spot where Brown was killed)

The Post cited a source who had been briefed on the
investigation as saying: 'The evidence at this point does not
support civil rights charges against Officer Wilson.'

Justice Department spokesman Brian Fallon was quoted by the
Post as saying its report was based on 'idle speculation.' An
attorney for Brown's family declined to comment to the newspaper
on 'something that is not official,' while Wilson's lawyer did
not respond to requests for comment.

Earlier this month the St. Louis Post-Dispatch published a
leaked county autopsy report that indicated Brown had residue on
his hand that could mean he struggled for Wilson's gun while the
officer was in his car. Some witnesses have said Wilson shot
Brown again after he got out of the car even though Brown's
hands were raised.

Brown's death drew attention to race relations in the United
States and police tactics in Ferguson, where much of the
population is black and the police force is mostly white.

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said last week he expects
the Justice Department's investigation into the shooting to be
complete by the time he leaves office.  

Tensions: The teenager's death sparked months of unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, with violent clashes between police and angry residents 

Holder said in September
he would not step down until his replacement was chosen and
confirmed by the Senate. The Obama administration is expected to
nominate a replacement by the end of the year.

On Thursday the police chief at the center of the scandal that erupted after Michael Brown was dead insisted he would not be stepping down.

Thomas Jackson has said he is staying put despite calls for him to quit and months of unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, following the death of the 18-year-old. 

He says that he wants to 'see it [the scandal]' through and believes he has the support of the police and the community.
