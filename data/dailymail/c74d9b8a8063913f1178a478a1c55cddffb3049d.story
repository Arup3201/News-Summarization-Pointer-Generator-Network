Like the rest of us, Bernard Gallacher has watched aghast at all the American antics since they lost in the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles.

How many own goals is it possible for one team to score? The 65-year-old Scot, so steeped in Ryder Cup lore — eight times a player and thrice a captain — believes the US agony will be prolonged with ill-advised moves such as the appointment of a task force.

‘It will swing back America’s way if they don’t panic but that’s exactly what they seem to be doing,’ he said. ‘The task force just looks a publicity stunt to me. They lost the Ryder Cup because they lost the foursomes matches 7-1. How’s a task force going to help on that?’

Maybe the task force will be disbanded now the maverick behind it, PGA of America president Ted Bishop, has been unceremoniously fired after hurling social media insults at Ian Poulter that would have been unbecoming in a playground.

‘During my time they had presidents who kept in the background,’ said Gallacher. ‘Now they want to get involved and help but it has the opposite effect.

‘The Poulter spat was an undignified thing for a man in his position to get involved in, and his appointment of Tom Watson didn’t work either. There was clearly a generation gap between Tom and his players and it made for a marked contrast with Paul McGinley. He was one of the boys and they wanted to play for him.’

Phil Mickelson, of course, could hardly have made it clearer in the losing team’s press conference he did not want to play for Watson. Gallacher believes this was another spectacular own goal.

He said: ‘Phil is a lovely guy, but it surely needed someone to tap him on the shoulder and say, “We all appreciate your passion and you’re trying to help, but your timing is completely wrong”. I would have been very disappointed if one of my players had done that. Phil must surely regret his actions in the cold light of day.’

What would Gallacher do if he was in charge? ‘I’d certainly get rid of the wildcards,’ he said. ‘I don’t know why they copied the Europeans on that one. We had to do it because a lot of our players were competing in America, but the Americans should just take the top 12 off their order of merit after the FedEx Cup. That way you’re letting every player know exactly what he needs to do to make the team.

‘They also need to stop over-reacting. The American college system is too strong not to turn out more great golfers. They were without key players in Tiger Woods, Dustin Johnson and Jason Dufner. What a difference they would have made.

‘And look at Medinah, where they lost by a whisker, or Celtic Manor in 2010, where they won three of the four series of matches. They’re acting like they’re a million miles away.’

As for the Europeans, the only big decision looming is who should be captain in 2016. Gallacher is another who would plump for Darren Clarke over Miguel Angel Jimenez. ‘I look at Darren’s Ryder Cup record over Miguel’s, and his general standing in the game,’ he argued.

And Gallacher himself? It is now 15 months since that fateful day when he suffered a cardiac arrest and was pronounced clinically dead, but thankfully he has made a full recovery.

He was back working for BBC 5 Live at The Open and the Ryder Cup and yesterday opened a comprehensive performance centre at the well-named World of Golf driving range at New Malden, London.

‘I’m fine. I’m back playing golf, going to the gym and driving again,’ he said. He and wife Lesley are also thinking over a Ryder Cup reunion of their own this winter.

‘Tony Jacklin and his wife Astrid have invited us to Florida to stay for a few days,’ he said.

A Ryder Cup task force, then, that does make sense.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK

‘Faldo’s record stands by itself. Six majors and all-time Ryder Cup points. Yours v His? Lil Girl.’

PGA of America president Ted Bishop takes Ian Poulter to task for having the temerity to stick up for a team-mate savaged by Sir Nick Faldo — and only succeeds in tweeting his own death warrant.

Hats off to Drysdale and Nixon

With 111th place in the Race to Dubai the cut-off mark for keeping your European Tour privileges for next season, imagine what it must have been like being on and around that mark and turning up for the last event of the regular campaign in Perth last week? A tip of the hat, therefore, to Scot David Drysdale, who moved from 116th place to 103rd on the back of finishing tied fourth, and Englishman Matt Nixon, who held on to that all-important 111th spot by finishing tied 23rd.
