For decades historians have tried to convince us that Vikings were nothing but peaceful traders and farmers.

But now, historians in Copenhagan have shown that they were in fact the fearsome warriors we had previously thought them to be.

Archaeologists behind ‘Viking’, an exhibition at the National Museum of Denmark, have explored the traditional idea of raiders and pillagers, inspiring fear wherever their longboats would take them.

The massive warship would have held 100 men, and 36 pairs of oars. It is thought that only royalty could have afforded to pay for such a vessel

The exhibition was opened by Queen Margerethe of Denmark today, and will arrive in London next year to launch the British Museum’s new exhibition space.

It focuses on the weaponry that Vikings would have used, such as swords, spears and arrows.

Archaeologist and co-coordinator Anne Pedersen told the Guardian: The arrow shape did more damage. The wounds were bigger and more difficult to heal than a straight edged slit.’

Also featured is the longest Viking warship ever found.  At 36m in length, it is  surrounded by swords and battle axes, showing the power and fear that the warriors would have invoked.

The exhibition features jewellery and clothing from the period, showing the wealth that Vikings sought

Vikings were traders, farmers, raiders and mercenaries with many amassing large collections of gold

Characters like Hagar the Horrible given an impression of Vikings being friendlier than they perhaps were

Petersen said: ‘Some of my colleagues thought surely one sword is enough but I said no one can ever have too many swords.’

Made from oak felled in 1025 in Oslo, it would have held 100 men and 36 pairs of oars.

The ship was found in Roskilde, home to a museum that was built to hold a fleet of Viking boats that were sunk 1,000 years ago to protect the harbour.

The vessel is thought to have taken 30,000 hours of labour to make, and it is likely that only royalty would have had the resources to pay for such a vessel.

Historians point to King Cnut the Great as a possible owner, as he conquered Norway in 1028 and England in 1016.

The
exhibition, which is the largest of its kind in 20 years, also explores
the idea of Vikings as mercenaries, travelling to Byzantium and 
Jerusalem.

Other objects 
featured include pieces of amber and jewellery incorporating Byzantine 
coins, and a pair of gold brooches created in the shape of tiny animals.

An
inscribed silver collar from Norway suggests that they came to Frisia 
to ‘exchange war garments from them’ but it is suggested that collars 
were used for slavery. Iron slave collars from Dublin show that the 
Vikings sought more than gold and silver.

The jewellery and metalwork on display shows the intricate carvings and designs favoured at the time

The exhibition, featuring Viking artwork, will travel to the British Museum next year

The exhibition takes in artifacts from collections across Europe, including the Lewis chessmen carvings from Britain.

Organisers hope that it will help show all wides of Viking life.

Petersen added: Probably only a small percentage of the Vikings ever went to sea on raiding parties, but I think that those who stayed home would have told stories of great warriors, great ships and great swords.’
