Louis van Gaal has wound up Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola by claiming every player he speaks to would love to join Manchester United. 

Guardiola annoyed Van Gaal last week by saying stars like Arjen Robben, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Thomas Muller were too expensive for United and that the players did not want to go anyway.

‘If the player wants to stay, they stay,’ said Guardiola. The slight clearly hit the mark because on Saturday night Van Gaal, a former Bayern manager, hit back by saying: ‘It is not so interesting what he said. I think every player I have contacted wants to play for Manchester United.

‘It is unbelievable that despite us not playing Champions League, the players are coming and willing to come.

'That is surprising but it is because of the greatness of this club and they believe in the project we have started now.’ 

Robben was linked with United before they signed Angel di Maria. Van Gaal also has close links to Bayern stars Muller and Holger Badstuber, whom he gave debuts to when he was at the Allianz Arena. 

The United manager’s comments suggest he either did not want to sign any of the Bayern squad or that the players would have gone to Old Trafford if Bayern had agreed.

Asked if Guardiola was correct and that United had tried to buy Bayern players, Van Gaal said: ‘People always think what is said to the media is correct. But it is not.'

But Van Gaal says his comments were of no interest to him and that he could sign many other top stars if he so wished too
