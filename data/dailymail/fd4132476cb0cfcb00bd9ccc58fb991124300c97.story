What to do with a problem like Angel di Maria? The Argentine could probably play in as many as five different positions in a 4-3-3 and at least three in a 4-4-2 but at times his versatility becomes his own worse enemy as coaches fail to settle on his best position.

Ask Carlo Ancelotti where he is best suited and he’ll say on the left of a middle three in a 4-3-3 where he excelled for Real Madrid last season. Ask Argentina coach Gerardo Martino and he will say he’s best in a front three where he caused havoc against Germany in a friendly earlier in the season.

His versatility was his salvation at the Bernabeu. He had established himself as a right winger but when £86million man Gareth Bale came in to take that position, Di Maria reinvented himself as a box-to-box midfielder and finished the campaign as arguably Real’s best player.

He still has all the attributes to play on the right wing; to hug the touchline and then come inside and shoot with his left foot. He can also play on the left wing and Jose Mourinho even had him down as a potential emergency left back such is ability to gallop up and down the flank.

But last season with Bale breathing down his neck for the right-wing position and Di Maria slotted into a more central berth for Carlo Ancelotti and was a revelation playing on the left of a three that also included Xabi Alonso and Luka Modric.

Ancelotti’s decision to use him in midfield was bold. Di Maria had operated there before for Benfica but there were questions over whether he had the tactical intelligence and the positional discipline to work in the position.

The doubts soon disappeared. He knew exactly when to cover the forward forays of Fabio Coentrao or Marcelo – Real’s two left backs – and he also knew when, instead of covering the overlapping full back, he himself needed to overlap.

Cristiano Ronaldo started games on the left flank but was never going to stay there for 90 minutes and Di Maria had to know that he could sprint into that unoccupied space down the left when Ronaldo was in a more central position. He did exactly that in European Cup final when his cross-shot led to Gareth Bale’s goal.

The midfield transformation worked better than anyone, even Ancelotti, could have dreamed. Di Maria was that modern football marvel – two players in one. Much like Dani Alves in his prime at Barcelona, who appeared to be playing as a right winger and a right back at the same time, Di Maria was playing as a back-tracking left-sided midfielder in a middle three and a left winger in a front three.

When Manchester United signed him at the start of the season it was no surprise that Louis van Gaal slotted him straight into that same position. And his first performances for United were evidence of just how well he plays the position.

He had less of an impact in United's last match against Crystal Palace and was taken off after 71 minutes

Di Maria played more than 50 times for Real Madrid before representing Argentina at the World Cup in Brazil 

Following Gareth Bale's arrival at Real Madrid, Di Maria switched flanks and enjoyed great success 

Di Maria was one of Real's best players last season

But there is always the temptation to put such a Road Runner-style player further forward where he can play without the defensive responsibilities of a winger.

In Argentina’s friendly against Germany earlier in the season he roamed with intent across the front three and scored in a man-of-the-match performance in a 4-2 win. His country are likely to use him in a similar position on Tuesday.

If he’s a success for Argentina in the front three and was Real’s best player last season in a middle three where does that leave Van Gaal?

The Dutch coach also has one other nagging doubt at the back of his mind: is it not the case that more than positional confuse Di Maria is suffering from fatigue?

Few players go through the gears so intensely out on the pitch and the Argentine has been playing ‘pedal to the floor’ since the start of last season. He needed a super-human effort to keep himself in the team and he delivered it. He ended up playing in 52 of Real Madrid’s 60 matches last season. 

He then followed it up with a physically exhausting World Cup and was then thrown straight into a move to a new country and a new league with all the physical and mental demands that that brings. 

It maybe that as well as a little dazed and confused from switching positions, he’s also just plain tired.
