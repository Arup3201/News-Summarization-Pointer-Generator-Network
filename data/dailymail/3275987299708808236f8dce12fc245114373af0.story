A 15-year-old soccer player died on Saturday from a suspected cardiac arrest on the pitch after teammates and spectators tried desperately to revive him.

Teenager Mark Arcuri, who played for the Austral Soccer Club's U16 team, collapsed during a game near Liverpool in Sydney's south-west.

The details surrounding the incident still remain unclear, with one report claiming the boy collapsed after heading a ball on the field, while another says he warned his coach that he felt unwell after running off the field, and collapsed shortly after.

It is also unclear at this stage if the boy had sustained an injury during the early afternoon game or if he suffered from a pre-existing medical condition.

The group that runs the league Mark played in is Southern Districts Soccer Football Association (SDSFA).

Association president Andy Favaloro told Daily Mail Australia a team mate's mother who worked as a nurse, tried to revive the boy by issuing CPR.

Mr Favaloro said Austral Soccer Club president Kevin Campbell also tried to help Mark, who was playing against the Liverpool Olympics under-16 team.

'Kevin knows [Mark's] family well and went to hospital with him,' Mr Favaloro said.

'The children who were playing were distraught.

'We were distraught ourselves to hear this had happened.'

A bystander performed CPR on the boy before paramedics attended the scene and took him to Liverpool hospital

Mr Favaloro said a minute's silence would be observed before each SDSFA game on Sunday in honour of Mark.

Friends of Mark took to Facebook to pay tribute to the teenager.

'May God be with his family during this really tough time they are going through,' Jason El Hawzi wrote.

'R.I.P to Mark Arcuri. Another life lost on earth, but another Angel gained in heaven.'

A spokesperson for Ambulance Service of NSW confirmed that a bystander performed CPR on the boy before paramedics attended the scene.

Paramedics rushed the teenager to Liverpool Hospital after attempting to stabilise him at the scene.

Inspector Steve Corry of Green Valley police told Channel Seven some of the boy's teammates had joined his parents at Liverpool Hospital.

'It's distressing for anyone to lose a young man at that age,' Insp Corry said.

A hospital spokesperson told the Daily Mail Australia at about 4pm on Saturday that the boy had died.

The SDSFAâ€™s Club Secretary, George McCulloch, told the Daily Mail that counciling is being organised for all the children who witnessed the incident.
