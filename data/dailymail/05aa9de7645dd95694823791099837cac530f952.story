Russia has announced plans to send manned flights to the moon by 2030, as it pledges to keep the International Space Station in orbit for nine more years.

Roscosmos, Russia's space agency, said it would launch the manned missions after reviving its lunar programme with unmanned spacecraft. 

The news comes three years after a leaked document from the federal agency suggested a manned mission to the moon was in the pipeline.

It was the first time Moscow had set a deadline for the space plans, hoping to recapture the early glory of the first space race, when they beat the U.S. at getting a man to orbit the earth.

Barack Obama previously wanted to get Americans onto Mars by 2030. 

A Roscosmos spokesman said: 'Close to 2030, the plan is to move over to manned flights to the Moon.'

The agency also announced that it would continue to work with Nasa on the ISS until 2024, when it hopes to build its own orbital station.

It says the station would aim to provide Russia 'with guaranteed access to the cosmos'.

Russian government officials had indicated last year that they may end funding of the ISS in 2020, amid strained relations between the the U.S and Russia over the Ukraine sanctions row.

Extensive cooperation in space between Washington and Moscow came under renewed pressure after the U.S banned high-tech exports to Russia.

But that proposal appears to have been rejected in favour of keeping it going for another four years, as Nasa had suggested. 

The space industry has been the root of fierce competition between Russia and the U.S dating back to the Cold War.

The U.S and the Soviet Union were locked in the so-called 'space race' for decades.

Russia's Yuri Gagarin was the first man in space in 1961 and Neil Armstrong of the United States was the first man on the Moon in 1969. 

But with the Cold War over, competition gave way to cooperation. 

Russia's subsequently deorbited its own Mir space station in 2001 as Moscow sought to concentrate its resources on the ISS.
