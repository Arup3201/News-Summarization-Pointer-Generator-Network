From the opening seconds, when Demba Ba clattered a shot into the woodwork almost directly from the kick-off, it was clear that this might be a European play-off containing a little more peril than normal for Arsenal. Aaron Ramsey’s late red card for two bookings summed up their discomfort.

Besiktas, and Ba in particular, seemingly on a mission to prove Chelsea sold the wrong striker, were not about to bow down and shower Arsene Wenger and his team with rose petals as they waved them into the group stages of the Champions League for the 17th successive year.

Slaven Bilic had them revved up and Wenger’s team performed, as they did against Crystal Palace on Saturday, with spirit and resistance but little fluency.

When they did pierce the Turks, they were not clinical in front of goal. Olivier Giroud was more wasteful than most. After an hour of pressure, Alexis Sanchez sprinted down the right and cut the ball on to his foot but the centre forward miscued.

Moments later, when Sanchez found Giroud, and accelerated into the penalty area he looked up to find possession had again been surrendered.

There would be no precious away goal and captain Mikel Arteta hobbled off early in the second half, but Arsenal should be relieved to head back to London with the tie level, knowing they could be stronger at the Emirates next week.

In recent years, Arsenal have turned this hurdle into something of a formality. Regularly, they have been drawn in an awkward-looking tie but each time they have breezed through, be it against Fenerbahce, Celtic, Udinese or whoever.

Not only have they advanced to the group stages, but they have actually won all 12 legs of their previous six play-off ties. So, perhaps avoiding complacency was Wenger’s biggest challenge as he prepared for a return to Istanbul, where his team have scored eight goals on their last two visits, both against Fenerbahce.

His team were certainly slow off the mark, although they were jolted into life when Ba went for goal from the kick-off and almost caught Wojciech Szczesny out. The audacious effort bounced on to the bar, after the slightest of touches from the goalkeeper.

It was an early warning. Bilic is an aggressive manager who throws players forward and attempts to attack first. His players were far more smoothly into their rhythm than the Londoners, on a pitch which was heavily watered but not as slick as Arsenal are used to in the Barclays Premier League.

Nine minutes later, Ba, who scored a hat-trick in the last qualifying round against Feyenoord, was in again. This time, he collected a cross from former Arsenal trainee Oguzhan Ozyakup and hit the target but Szczesny sprung to his left to beat it away.

Ba, who almost joined Arsenal on loan from Chelsea last summer, was highly motivated and seemingly intent on reminding English football what he does well, which is threaten the goal and make centre halves uncomfortable. It is only three months since his goal at Liverpool proved so influential in the destiny of the title.

Close but no cigar: Olivier Giroud nearly gave Arsenal the lead but was unable to get a clean strike when supplied by Alexis Sanchez

Frustrated figure: Giroud endured a disappointing evening for the Gunners in his first start of the season

Here he was again, reminding the Premier League they have no automatic right to four places in the Champions League proper.

Wenger’s team were at full stretch and the Turkish fans turned up the volume. It must have been quite an introduction to European football for Calum Chambers.

In the main, he handled his early tests with maturity belying his teenage years, but was caught out two minutes before half-time when Ba jinked past him and Nacho Monreal. The striker ought to have found the net but pulled a drive horribly off target.

Szczesny also saved from Veli Kavlak in the first half and yet in between these Besiktas raids there were flickers of encouragement for Arsenal. Sanchez and Santi Cazorla were enjoying space on the wings and used it effectively.

Sanchez found Giroud in front of goal but Pedro Franco smothered the danger as he tried to work an effort on goal. Cazorla dashed across goal, left to right, but dragged his shot wide and Jack Wilshere, after bouncing a pass off Giroud, was denied by Tolga Zengin as he tried to curl a left-footer around the goalkeeper.

Whatever Arsenal did during the interval, they were unable to alter the pattern of Besiktas dominance. Arsenal lost Arteta, hurt in a midfield tangle with Ba. On came Mathieu Flamini.

Besiktas remained positive and opened up another clear chance soon after the restart. This time it was Olcay Sahan who was released on the left, and cut inside on to his right foot, only to drift his shot wide of the far post.

On the touchline, Bilic became more agitated, taking umbrage with Chambers for a tackle that went unpunished and then reacting angrily when Ramon Motta was booked.

Referee Milorad Mazic gave him a warning. Bilic briefly retreated but was soon back on the edge of his large technical area. Perhaps what he said had the desired effect, as Ramsey, Wilshere and Monreal were soon shown yellow cards, cautions which can accumulate quickly and come back to bite in European football. That proved the case with Ramsey, ejected soon after.

Serbian referee Milorad Mazic tried to calm the Croatian down. Bilic briefly retreated but was soon back on the edge of his large technical area, his antics as manic as ever.

He went crazy at the fourth official when Mazic stopped play for Mathieu Flamini to receive treatment when the ball smacked him in the face and the Besiktas boss was sent to the stands in the final seconds of the game, applauded all the way by the home fans.

Ramsey was dismissed 10 minutes from time for a pull on Oguzhan Ozyakup in midfield, his second such foul in the second half and the game ended with a bottle hurled at Wenger as he stalked down the tunnel.

It missed. Another pitfall avoided by the Arsenal boss.
