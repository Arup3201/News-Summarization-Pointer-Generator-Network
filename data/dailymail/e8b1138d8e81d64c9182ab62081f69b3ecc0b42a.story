Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal believes goalkeeper David de Gea will sign a new contract at the club.

De Gea is in talks with United over extending a deal that only has 18 months left to run.

With Real Madrid interested in taking the 24-year-old back to Spain and United this week signing the experienced Victor Valdes as back-up, some fans are worried De Gea may leave.

But asked if he thought his goalkeeper would stay, Van Gaal said on Friday: ‘I think so, yes. I think there is no problem for him to sign. It’s the same as other players. You can ask other players and I can answer the same.

‘It’s always like that; when you are a fixed line-up player, then probably you are the best and then the manager is very happy that a player that is fixed in the line-up will stay. It’s always like that.’

Valdes will be on the bench as United host Southampton in the Barclays Premier League tomorrow at Old Trafford and Van Gaal believes the competition between the two Spaniards can help elevate his team to new levels.

‘Nobody is happy to be No 2,’ said Van Gaal. ‘He has to have the ambition to beat De Gea. That will be very hard for him but my ambition is to have the best players who can co-operate and make us the best team in the world.

De Gea has been in fine form this season and has kept United in many games

‘I can only say that David de Gea has developed himself in the six months that I’ve been here very much. I’m very pleased with his development.’

Van Gaal would not be drawn on whether United will sign any other players in January but revealed that Ashley Young is now the only injured player in the squad. Young’s hamstring trouble will keep him out for four weeks but other long-term injury sufferers such as Daley Blind and Marcos Rojo are in the squad along with Luke Shaw and Rafael, who have had minor problems.

‘We only have one injury,’ smiled Van Gaal. ‘Can you believe it? I have a full selection of players within three weeks.

‘Normally, we should then play better because a lot of players who were also fixed in my line-up — Daley Blind and Angel di Maria — are coming back. Rojo is also fixed in my line-up. I didn’t have the chance to build up with the same players. I hope that I can do that now, but you never know.’

England left back Shaw has recovered from his latest ankle injury but Van Gaal admitted his tendency to get injured is a worry.

‘You are right because I have put to him the same question as you did,’ said Van Gaal. ‘It’s a very interesting question but I don’t speak about our conversations with players. I’m sorry.’

Meanwhile, Ronald Koeman has heaped pressure on Van Gaal by insisting United must challenge for the title given the money they spent in the summer. Van Gaal was backed to the tune of £150million yet has twice played down his side’s chances of winning the league.

But Koeman, who has shared a fractious relationship with his counterpart since they fell out at Barcelona, claims Van Gaal has no excuses.

‘They have great players so it’s normal that they will fight for titles,’ said Koeman. ‘They have to. How can you spend that money, how can you sign that kind of players and not be fighting to win titles?

‘Everything is up to Manchester United. They have a very successful coach, they have great players, they have money, they have great fans, a great stadium. It’s normal that you win titles. We had problems in the past. We shake hands and I hope he will do well with United. It would be special to beat him, but I lost last time and we try to put it right.’

Southampton were unfortunate to lose 2-1 to United at St Mary’s last month, when two clinical goals from Robin van Persie decided the game.

Koeman added: ‘I believe we belong in the top four. I hope the players show that as well. Our recent victory against Arsenal was important and the draw with Chelsea.

‘We didn’t have that kind of result before the United game last time. We lost because of our mistakes and the individual qualities of their players. That’s the difference. We can beat them.’
