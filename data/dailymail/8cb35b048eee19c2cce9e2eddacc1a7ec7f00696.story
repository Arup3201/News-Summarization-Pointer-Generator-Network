The man who played the legendary Darth Vader during fight scenes in the original Star Wars trilogy has died, it has emerged today.

Bob Anderson, 89, was a former Olympic swordsman who worked on many of the best known films of the past seven decades - but very few people are aware of the influence he had on some of our favourite movies.

He is most famous for donning Darth Vader's black helmet and fighting lightsaber battles in two of the original films - most memorably with Luke Skywalker in The Empire Strikes Back.

responsible for crafting fighting moves for some of the characters.

Kept secret: Bob Anderson's role in the original Star Wars trilogy was not initially publicised until it was revealed by Mark Hamill, who played Luke Skywalker, in an interview in 1983

His role as Vader’s stunt double in the lightsaber battles of The Empire Strikes Back and Return
 of the Jedi were not publicised until it was revealed by Mark Hamill, who played Luke Skywalker, in an interview in 1983.

He said: 'Bob Anderson was the man 
who actually did Vader’s fighting. It was always supposed to be a 
secret, but I finally told George I didn’t think it was fair any more.

'Bob worked so bloody hard that he deserves some recognition. It’s 
ridiculous to preserve the myth that it’s all done by one man.'

As a competitive fencer, Mr Anderson also represented Great Britain in the 1952 Olympic Games and the World Championships in 1950 and 1953 in the sabre event.
