'Likeable and genuine' Grant Weston, 24, from Pembroke, died early this morning after falling from a balcony in San Antonio, Ibiza

A young footballer has died after falling more than 50ft from a balcony during a holiday with friends in Ibiza.

Grant Weston, 24, from Pembroke, had been on a night out with friends in San Antonio on the western side of the party island when he fell to his death.

Mr Weston, a popular member of the Pembrokeshire Football League, had been enjoying a holiday with more than a dozen friends when he died in the early hours of this morning.

Police on the island are now questioning his friends but say Mr Weston's death is not suspicious.

Mark Powell, manager of the village team of Hundleton in Pembrokeshire, said: 'He was a genuine lad.

'He had everything to live for and it's so cruel that he has been taken away from us.  He had a brilliant sense of humour and I have known him for the past eight years.

'It's a shock, I feel for his family and he will be a great loss to our football club.'

Mr Weston lived with his parents Kim, 58, Sheila, 55, and brother Robert, 22, but they were too upset to comment.

His football team today said they were pulling out of tonight's match in a local tournament in Mr Weston's honour.

Hundleton team committee member Paul Jones said: 'He was a lovely lad. Quiet, but very likeable, and he was an excellent footballer.

'We are devastated by this tragic event and he will be sadly missed. Our hearts reach out his family at this extremely sad time.'

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We can confirm the death of a British national, Grant Weston, in Ibiza on August 14th.

'We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.'

The tragic death of a young British tourist is the second in the resort in two weeks.  Last week Briton Christopher Briggs, 25, died after falling and hitting his head following a night out with friends in San Antonio.

Mr Briggs, from Blackburn, Lancashire, had been due to spend a week on the holiday island, staying at the two-star Hostal Apolo.
