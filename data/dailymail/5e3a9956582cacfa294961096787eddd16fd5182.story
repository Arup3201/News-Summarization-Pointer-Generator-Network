Andy Murray sweltered to victory in the hottest Wimbledon final in living memory - with temperatures soaring to 122F as he played.

The Scot at times appeared close to wilting in the cauldron of Centre Court which is a notorious sun trap, made worse by the slight overhang of the roof.

Club officials said the temperature in direct sunlight as the players came out for the start of the match just before 2pm was 49.8C (122F).

Keeping his cool:  Murray cooled off with drinks and ice and frequently mopped his brow in the stifling conditions on Centre Court

Both Murray and his Serbian opponent donned a baseball cap for much of the game as they desperately tried to shield themselves from the blazing sun.

The Scot frequently mopped his brow and at times misjudged his ball toss when serving, apparently because of having the sun in his eyes.

Police put out a warning as the match started urging fans to keep drinking water and try and get some shade in the soaring temperatures.

But St John Ambulance treated 79 people for heat related ailments at the All England Club during the final for ailments including dehydration, sunburn and heat exhaustion.

Blazing Sunday: Supporters on Murray Mound queued for water and many enjoyed Pimms to cool off

Across Centre Court, crowds continuously waved fans and programmes as they tried to keep themselves cool.

Club officials appeared to move the retractable roof forward a little to keep the dignitaries and celebrities in Centre Court in the shade.

On Murray Mount, 4,000 supporters sheltered from the sun under umbrellas and union flags.

Long queues formed near drinking water points as they struggled to cope in the sizzling weather.

Others refreshed themselves with frequent glasses of Pimm’s which helped fuel raucous cheers as Murray took the match.
