Prime Minister Tony Abbott will lay a floral tribute to the victims of Malaysia Airlines flight 17 at the military barracks in the Netherlands where their bodies are being identified by forensic experts.

Mr Abbott on Monday will travel to the barracks at Hilversum where a Dutch-led team of investigators has so far identified 65 of the 298 passengers who died when MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine.

The prime minister will leave flowers at what has become a temporary shrine to the victims before meeting with Australian forensic experts who are part of the team using DNA, fingerprints and dental records to identify victims.

The prime minister is expected to arrive in the Netherlands on Sunday night local time (Monday 5am AEST).

He's being accompanied on the trip by Australian Federal Police (AFP) Commissioner Tony Negus and Chief of the Defence Force Air Chief Marshall Mark Binskin.

The party will initially travel to Eindhoven airbase on Monday morning to tour one of the RAAF C-17 transporters that has been used to repatriate bodies from Ukraine's second-biggest city, Kharkiv.

Military planes have also shuttled in and out Australian and other experts who last week searched the crash site.

Mr Abbott will meet with RAAF crew and have lunch with ADF personnel.

He will then fly from the Netherlands to London for talks with the British government and officials about counter-terrorism operations and the deteriorating situation in Iraq.
