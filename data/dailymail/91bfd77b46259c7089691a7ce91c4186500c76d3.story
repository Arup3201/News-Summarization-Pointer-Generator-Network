Everton's defence may have been ruthlessly exposed by Dynamo Kiev on Thursday but Roberto Martinez's problems don't end there.

The Toffees were second best in all areas of the pitch as they exited the Europa League 6-4 on aggregate, leaving them to concentrate on a Premier League campaign which has failed to ignite.

With Martinez's men languishing 14th in the table - 23 points and nine places worse off than at this stage last season - Sportsmail takes a look at the underperforming players the Spaniard must get rid of this summer if the Blues are to get back on track in 2015-16.

Tim Howard

After a stellar first season under Martinez and some brilliant performance at the World Cup with the USA, Howard been arguably Everton's worst player this season.

High profile errors - particularly at home to Chelsea, Crystal Palace and Leicester - have helped cost the Toffees much-needed points and contributed to a shaky, unsure defence.

Martinez's decision to return Howard to his starting XI after injury - despite some promising displays from Joel Robles - has backfired. At 36, he will only get worse.

Antolin Alcaraz

Off the pace and out his depth against Dynamo, Alcaraz's 18 months at Goodison Park have been a mixed bag of injuries, decent performances and some truly awful defending.

The Paraguayan, who was also part of Martinez's back-three at Wigan, lacks the speed and consistency to play for a team with European aspirations, while he is always liable to pick up a knock.

With his contract up at the end of the season, it'd be wise to invest Alcaraz's wages elsewhere.

Steven Pienaar 

A regular under David Moyes, Pienaar has simply been unable to stay fit under Martinez.

He shone on the opening day of the season against Leicester, working in tandem with Leighton Baines down the Toffees' left side, but has not played since mid-December and has made just eight Premier League appearances this season.

The team has missed his partnership with Baines, guile and eye for a pass but, at 33 and with his injury problems persisting, Pienaar's time in the first-team looks over.

Sylvain Distin

Age appears to have finally caught up with Distin after a catastrophic start to the season left him out of the team and almost certainly on his way out of the club.

The 37-year-old was consistently at fault in the early stages of the campaign, contributing to the Toffees' awful defensive record with ponderous, error-prone displays.

Now stuck playing for the Under 21 side after falling out of favour with Martinez, it's time the Frenchman hung up his boots or moved on.

Aiden McGeady

Over a year into his Everton career and McGeady is still yet to show the form which convinced Spartak Moscow to spend almost £10million on him in 2010.

Although quick with the ball at his feet, the Republic of Ireland international's delivery leaves much to be desired and he has chipped in with just one goal since his arrival.

Improvement is needed if he is ever going to earn a regular place in Martinez's starting XI - and in the hearts of Evertonians.

Gareth Barry

One of the most important cogs in Martinez's well-oiled machine of last season, Barry has fallen well below the high standards he set last year.

At 33 he has played too much football in 2014-15 and should've been rested when in the midst of an awful run of form prior to Christmas.

Nevertheless he looks to be growing slower by the game and is struggling more and more to keep up with the pace of the Premier League.

Tony Hibbert

Another player with an awful fitness record, Hibbert has managed just four Premier League appearances all season and last played in the top-flight on December 6.

As a local lad with over a decade at the club it's easy to let sentiment get in the way when it comes to Hibbert and his role as a squad player.

But with promising defender Tyias Browning coming through the ranks, there's little need for him now.
