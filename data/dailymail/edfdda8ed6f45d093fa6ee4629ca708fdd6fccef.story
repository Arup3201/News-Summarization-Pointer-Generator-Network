Archaeologists with the Army Corps of Engineers are searching for what may be the sole photograph of  Civil War-era ironclad CSS Georgia as they salvage its remains from the Savannah River.

So far, the only person able to verify details about the photo is the man who found it at a yard sale in Georgia in the 1980s - John Potter.

Potter said he was looking through a collection of antiques at a home in Waycross when he stumbled upon a picture frame that caught his eye.

In the frame was a photograph with a silhouetted individual in a coat and hat positioned in the foreground of the hulking frame of a boxy object.

Potter described the photo itself as blurred and stained by damage from water or chemicals, but said an inscription on the back of the frame that read 'CSS Georgia' may accurately identify its subject.

'I knew exactly what it was,' said Potter, who now lives in North Carolina. 'I thought, "This belongs in a museum."'

Potter did not have the $175 that the seller wanted for the photo, though he snapped a picture of it, a copy of which was later sent to the Georgia Historical Society.

'The photo is just as much a mystery as the CSS Georgia, because nobody has seen it in years,' said archaeologist Julie Morgan of the Army Corps of Engineers.

The Corps is currently working on a $14million project to recover the wreckage of the ironclad from the bottom of the Savannah River.

Illustrated history: No blueprints or photographs have yet been verified, meaning the only visual record of the CSS Georgia is made up of illustrations, whose details vary between images

With no photographs or blueprints to confirm the boat's original structure, researchers have only a handful of illustrations to go on. 

The armored warship CSS Georgia was part of an ironclad-building craze during the Civil War though it did nothing to aid the Confederacy's war efforts.

The Ladies Gunboat Association of Savannah raised $115,000 in funds to build the CSS Georgia as a way to protect the city. 

The ship's engines were too weak to fight the Savannah River's currents, and the 1,200-ton ship was left floating off Fort Jackson as a gun battery.

It finished the war without ever firing a shot, scuttled by its Confederate crew in December 1864 as General William Tecumseh Sherman captured the city of Savannah. 

The former curator of the National Civil War Naval Museum, Robert Holcolmbe, says the copy of the  photograph made by Potter all but confirmed the original was of the CSS Georgia.

Holcombe said the shape in the photo conforms to the unique 45-degree angles of the CSS Georgia's armor casement that covers its deck.

'If it's an original, it's certainly the Georgia, just by process of elimination,' Holcombe explained. That or 'it's an awfully good fake.'
