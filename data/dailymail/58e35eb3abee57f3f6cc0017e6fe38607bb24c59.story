A learner driver has received a ticking off from a 999 operator after he called to say he had received a ticking off from his driving instructor.

The unnamed man contacted West Midlands Police when his lesson was terminated after he 'gave her attitude' for turning up 10 minutes late.

He told them that he needed to complain to someone but his call has been branded as 'ridiculous' and a waste of time and resources.

They have released audio of the phone call made last Thursday at 8am to highlight how time-wasting calls to 999 can cost lives.

Complaint: A learner driver dialled 999 to complain after his driving instructor terminated their lesson because he was 'giving her attitude' for being late (stock image)

The learner driver, who has not been named by West Midlands Police, can be heard telling the operator: 'Sorry, it's silly, but I've got an emergency'.

He then continues speaking in a rush, saying: 'The person who’s supposed to be teaching
me came late and now she’s asking me to get out of her car. She’s 
saying I’m giving her attitude. Can you please come over?'

The operator then asks the man to slow down and explain what has happened.

He tells the operator: 'I know it's not an emergency but she's telling me I'm giving her attitude and to get out of her car. I need someone to complain to.'

The operator calmly explains that the problem isn't one for the police and the man needs to contact the driving instructor's company or the DVLA.

When the learner driver persists, the operator tells him he must get out of the instructors car if he has been told to do so and warned trivial matters don’t qualify as 999 emergencies.

The call is the latest in a series of nuisance calls to West Midlands police. 

Warning: Police described the 999 call as 'ridiculous' and warned that time wasting phone calls can lead to delays in answering real emergencies

Officers say other ‘emergencies’ they have been called to in recent weeks include one person who had a blocked sink plug in a hotel room and someone who had forgot their computer password.

West Midlands Police Contact Centre Chief Inspector Sally Holmes said: 'We regularly receive calls on the 9s about lost property, people asking for directions and revellers who’ve been denied entry to nightclubs.

'It’s astonishing listening to them but they hide a serious truth. Each call often takes minutes to deal with as staff have to clarify the situation - it might not sound like much but, if someone is trying to get through to report a genuine life or death emergency, then a minute is a very long time to wait.

'I cannot stress enough the 999 number is for emergencies only. This is defined as a crime in progress, if someone suspected of a crime is nearby, when there is danger to life or when violence is being used or threatened. To contact police for any other reason, call 101.'

West Midlands Police said they get more than 1,500 calls to their 999 number each day and staff have to deal with each one professionally.

Other police forces blighted by nonsense emergency calls include South Yorkshire Police, who told of a man calling who had lost his trainers, a child refusing to go to bed and people having problems watching films on Sky TV.

In parts of the country forces are taking up to 30 per cent longer than two years ago to react to 999 calls a recent investigation has revealed.
