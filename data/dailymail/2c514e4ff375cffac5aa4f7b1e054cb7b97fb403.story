A teenager has been jailed for just three years after killing his friend in a horrific crash after crashing into a field where he rolled his car after driving at speeds of up to 101mph.

David Powell, 20, was killed when Joseph Salah-Eldin, 19, drove his Vauxhall Corsa near Kings Lynn in Norfolk last September.

A court heard Salah-Eldin, who had only been driving for a couple of months, was almost twice the drink drive limit and was changing the radio when his car careered off the road and overturned.

It killed Mr Powell instantly and left two other passengers with injuries.

Yesterday, Salah-Eldin was jailed for three years four months. He was also
banned from driving for five years after he admitted causing death by 
careless driving when unfit through drink.

After seeing Salah-Eldin jailed yesterday, Mr Powell's grief-stricken family 
gave a statement. 'Sudden car crash 
tragedies, caused by speeding and alcohol, devastate families and change
lives forever.

'No-one can foresee the impact of the loss, grief, anger, bewilderment and heartbreak of losing a loved one so suddenly.

'Cars,
alcohol and young men are a lethal combination and young drivers and 
passengers need to be aware of the destruction this can cause - not only
to those involved in collisions, but the families and loved ones left 
behind.

'Our family has been robbed of its future, our son robbed of his life - so many dreams and plans unfulfilled.'

The catastrophic crash happened just after midnight on the A149 at Heacham, near King's Lynn.

Prosecutor Chris Youell said Salah-Eldin, of Dersingham, lost control about 60 metres into a 40mph zone

Mr Youell said: 'The only vehicle in the area at that time was the vehicle being driven by the defendant.

'There was no reason for that vehicle to leave the road at that time other than the admitted careless driving of the defendant.'

He said Salah-Eldin had only passed his test at the third attempt two months before the crash.

Mr Youell said he was travelling at an 'excessive speed' and 'adjusting the sound system in the car' at the time.

Salah-Eldin swerved across the road before hitting a pavement, hedge and repeatedly rolling before ending up on its roof in a field.

Mr Powell, a back seat passenger, 
suffered a head injury and died instantly. Another friend in the car 
sustained bruising and a broken finger and another a broken nose.

Mr Youell said 
Salah-Eldin, who suffered a dislocated shoulder, was believed to be 
driving between 74mph and 101mph when he crashed.

He said he had been drinking with friends at Dersingham Social Club earlier that fateful night.Salah-Eldin was breath tested by police and had 65mcg of alcohol in 100mls of breath. The legal limit is 35.

Jailing him at Norwich Crown Court, judge Stephen Holt told him: 'No words I can say will possibly help the friends and family. It's an utter tragedy that has occurred.'

The
judge added: 'It's said time and time again in these courts that young 
drivers who speed cause these sort of terrible events which ruin 
people's lives.'

Judge Holt said that cases like this go to show 'just how dangerous it is for anyone, let alone young drivers, to be drinking'.

Mr Youell read out a statement on behalf of Mr Powell's shattered mother Margaret.

She said the family had been 'devastated' by his death.

Mr Powell was a chef at Sandringham visitors' centre and was 'proud' to have worked on the Queen's grand estate - at the request of a senior member of the royal family.

Mr Youell said the death of Mr Powell, who wanted to be a 'policeman and father', had left a 'huge hole' in the life of his family, including parents, sister and girlfriend.

Jonathan Morgans, defending, said Salah-Eldin wanted to express his 'remorse' and say sorry.

Mr Morgans said: 'He takes full responsibility for his actions and the result of his actions is that his best friend has died. He misses him and it's his fault. There's nothing he can do to turn back the clock but his remorse is total as is his regret.

'He has real insight into the family's loss because he shares it. To apologise can only ever be inadequate but it's heartfelt and sincere. He will have to live with the consequences of his actions forever.'

Steve Matthews, senior investigating officer with Norfolk Police Serious Collision Investigation Team, said Salah-Eldin was a newly-qualified driver.

He said that combined with alcohol and excessive speed was a 'recipe for disaster'.

Chief Inspector Chris Spinks, of Norfolk and Suffolk Roads Policing Unit, said: 'This tragic incident has had an enormous impact on the lives of all those involved, their friends and their families.

'One young man has had his life cut short, and another faces time in prison and must live with the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life. Two other young men have experienced first-hand the dangers of drinking and driving.'

Every high school and college in Norfolk is now being urged by police to educate young drivers in a bid to prevent accidents.

Salah-Eldin was told he must serve half his sentence before being released on licence.
