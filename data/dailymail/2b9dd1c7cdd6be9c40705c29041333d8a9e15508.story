Tragic death: Former Stamford High School football player Marcus Dixon, pictured, accidentally shot himself on Thursday night

A former Stamford High School football player who overcame homelessness as a teenager to play for West Point has died after accidentally shooting himself in the head.

Marcus Dixon, 22, was showing his .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol to friends at his Stillwater Road apartment just after 7pm on Thursday when he held the gun to his head and pulled the trigger.

According to police, the footballer had taken the magazine out of the weapon and pulled the stunt thinking it was empty, but one round was still in the chamber.

Dixon was pronounced dead at the scene and drugs or alcohol did not appear to be a factor in the death, Lt. Diedrich Hohn told The Stamford Advocate.

'There was nothing illegal. It was a tragic accident,' Hohn said.

Dixon never knew his biological mother and told The Advocate in an interview four years ago that his father dropped him off in the town when he was in seventh grade with the parting words: 'Kid, you're on your own now.'

The teenager managed to avoid foster homes, staying with various friends.

When he was 17, his friend Lauren McInerney's parents, Rose and Barry, tracked his father down and legally adopted Dixon, prompting '180-degree turn' in his life.

But his family and football teammates are now mourning the tragic loss of the young star.

Captain Richard Conklin told the 
newspaper that Dixon may have been under the mistaken impression that 
the weapon he was holding had a magazine disconnect safety, which makes 
the gun inoperable when the magazine is removed.

But Dixon's pistol did not have that safety feature.

Two of Dixon's friends were performing CPR on him when police and emergency crews arrived but he could not be resuscitated.

'Marcus had a lot of rough spots in his life and did not have it easy growing up,' former Stamford High School coach Kevin Jones told the Advocate.

'When he came to us there were a lot of things that we needed to address that had nothing to do with football, but we used football as a way to deal with them. The turnaround that kid made is probably the greatest I have ever seen in my 20 years of coaching.'

Jones said Dixon was blessed with a mature body when he was young and had a tremendous work ethic.

The team was 5-5 in Dixon's senior year, during which he rushed for 977 yards and scored two touchdowns. He also had 35 tackles on defense.

Current Stamford High School Head Coach Bryan Hocter was still struggling to come to terms with the tragedy.Â 

'I'm in shock. I don't know what to say. It is a horrible accident for something like this to happen. It's just awful,' Hocter said.
