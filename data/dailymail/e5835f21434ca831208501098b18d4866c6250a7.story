Alec Baldwin is speaking out again – this time, against trips to the circus.

In a four-minute video on behalf of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, the outspoken actor urges Americans to boycott Ringling Bros and other circuses because of their inhumane treatment of elephants.

He claims that elephants live very different lives than their wild cousins and from a young age are ‘stretched out, slammed to the ground, gouged with bull hooks, and shocked with electric prods.’

In the video, Baldwin describes the apparent horrors suffered by elephants in the circus.

‘Having worked with actors for many years, it’s hard to believe that anyone would have to be dragged kicking and screaming into show business,’ Baldwin begins.

‘But for the elephants for Ringling Bros and other circuses, that’s exactly what happens.’

The Emmy-award winning actor cites a 2009 PETA investigation first reported by the New York Daily News in which animal handlers are shown beating elephants moments before they appear in the ring.

Baldwin says the conditions in which these elephants live is deplorable, adding that the pachyderms are ‘kept chained and confined to cramped boxcars. 

‘The lack of mental and physical stimulation results in severe frustration, and is the reason why you frequently see elephants in circuses swaying back and forth,’ he explains.

A spokesman for Ringling Bros Barnum & Bailey condemned the video for rehashing old footage and distorting its meaning.

‘The health and vitality of our animals is something we can showcase at every Ringling Bros performance,’ Stephen Payne told the New York Daily News. 

‘We invite families everywhere to come and see for themselves how all the animals are thriving at “The Greatest Show on Earth.”’

However, Feld Entertainment – which owns the circus company – agreed to pay a $270,000 fine last November for allegedly violating the Animal Welfare Act.

Though the company never admitted to any wrongdoing or violating regulations, it is still the largest AWA fine on record.Since the settlement, employees who work with animals must undergo AWAK compliance training.PETA is also in a battle against HBO’s now-cancelled series Luck. 

The animal rights organisation accuses the show of mistreating its horses as well as using injured and arthritic thoroughbreds susceptible to injury.
