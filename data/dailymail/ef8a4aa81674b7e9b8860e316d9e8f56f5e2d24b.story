Ever-gracious actress Amy Adams traded her first class seat on an early-morning flight from Detroit to Los Angeles with a soldier who had been booked in coach on Friday, after noticing the American serviceman in uniform at the gate.

The American Hustle star said the generous move was something she had always wanted to do, and decided it was time to make it happen.

She quietly arranged the swap on the Delta airlines flight with a flight attendant and then told the soldier.

'I didn't do it for attention for myself,' the 39-year-old told Inside Edition after landing in LA.

'I did it for attention for the troops.'

Many passengers noticed what Adams did and watched her scurry to her new seat in coach.

The flight, DL1706, landed at LAX at 10.30am Friday.

ESPN personality Jemele Hill was on the flight and witnessed what happened.

'When we were waiting to board, I saw her glance the soldier's way and then she said something to the person she was traveling with," Hill told Today.

'Once we boarded, I saw she was in first class.

'I was upgraded to first class and she was a couple rows behind me.

'I think she must have said something to the flight attendant, because before we took off she had vacated her seat and the flight attendant brought the soldier to her seat.

'I just thought it was incredibly classy and thoughtful.

'I already was a fan of hers, but now I'm a bigger one after today.'
