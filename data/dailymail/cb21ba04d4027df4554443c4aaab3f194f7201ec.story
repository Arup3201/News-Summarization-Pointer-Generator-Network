The remains of missing Darwin mother Carlie Sinclair have been found in a bush grave just days before what would have been her 37th birthday.

The discovery was made by Northern Territory police's forensics team on Wednesday morning, five days after a grave was found in bushland on a private property in Berry Springs - about 60km south of Darwin.

The remains are yet to be formally identified as Carlie's, but NT Police Commissioner John McRoberts said he had no doubt they were the missing woman's.

Carlie's mother and father, Marlene and Robert, and her brother Kristian flew to Darwin on Friday once they learned of the arrest of her partner, Danny Deacon, on suspicion of murder.

Marlene Sinclair said it had been a long 18 months since Carlie's disappearance.

Carlie went missing on June 18 last year from her business premises in Parap - north of the Northern Territory capital.

'She was such a lovely, joyous, kind person. To think something like this could happen to her is unbelievable,' she said.

Marlene also thanked the police for their tireless investigation.

'They kept us going when things were really down and black. Every single one of them has been so kind and just helped wherever they could,' she said tearfully.

'This is just amazing, the work they have done to get a resolution to this. It just simply is awesome.'

Danny Deacon appeared in the Darwin Magistrates Court earlier on Wednesday charged with murder.

He did not apply for bail and will front court again in February. 

Mr McRoberts said it would take some days before a full positive identification of the body can be made.

'Today is a sad day, not only because we have recovered the remains of a woman who we say was murdered, but today is in fact the anniversary of Carlie's birthday. Tomorrow she would have turned 37,' he said.

Mr McRoberts also gave words of comfort to Ms Sinclair's family.

'We can only imagine the grief you have experienced over the past 18 months,' he said.

'[We] hope that today's discovery gives you some comfort to understand what happened to your loving daughter and sister, Carlie.'

NT police had assistance and support from Queensland police, Western Australian police, the Australian Federal Police and specialist advice from the FBI in the US 'because we would not leave any stone unturned', Mr McRoberts said.
