Ed Miliband is on course to record a thumping victory at the next General Election owing to a surge in popularity for the anti-Brussels UKIP party.

The dramatic rise in UKIP support will cost David Cameron a staggering 51 seats at the next Election, giving Labour an overall majority of 94 seats, according to survey for The Mail on Sunday.

Support for UKIP, led by maverick Nigel Farage, has soared from 3 per cent in 2010 to an all-time high of 16 per cent in the Survation poll, transforming the likely outcome of the next Election, due in 2015.

Analysis by Britain’s leading pollster, Professor John Curtice, shows the Conservatives would lose 41 MPs as a result of the UKIP boom – with all but one going to Labour.

Tory victims would include Ministers Chloe Smith and Brandon Lewis, and rising star Jacob Rees-Mogg.

And ten seats the Conservatives would have regained as a result of the Lib Dems’ slump will stay with Nick Clegg’s party, all because of UKIP.

The poll shows Labour on 38 per cent, the Tories on 29, UKIP with 16 and the Lib Dems on 11. Had UKIP remained at 3 per cent, the figures would be enough to give Mr Miliband a wafer-thin Commons majority of ten. However, the haemorrhage of Tory votes to UKIP turns it into a landslide majority of 94.

The survey comes as Mr Cameron plans to revive the battered Coalition with a ‘mid-term review’ tomorrow.

He will try to bounce back from the child benefit cuts row by accusing Labour of planning an £83 billion welfare spree.

Prof Curtice, of Strathclyde University, said: ‘This poll turns an Election that would otherwise look like a reasonably close contest look like an easy walkover for Labour.

Tory supporters have been unhappy with the Government ever since George Osborne’s omnishambles Budget.

I would expect UKIP to fall away to some degree by the Election but the only way the Tories can put things right is by restoring their reputation for competence.’

Westminster’s first-past-the-post system means that UKIP would still fail to return a single MP – despite the backing of one in six voters – although 50 per cent of those polled said they would like to see Mr Farage in the Commons.

Asked who they backed on Europe, 24 per cent chose Mr Cameron, with Mr Farage in second place on 20, ahead of Mr Miliband on 19 and Mr Clegg on seven.

UKIP could even beat the Conservatives in the 2014 Euro elections. A total of 24 per cent said they would vote Tory, with UKIP on 22, Labour 31 and the Lib Dem 11.

More than two in five said they would consider voting UKIP in the EU poll.

Mr Farage said: ‘This is the best poll we have ever had. It shows we are now being taken seriously as a mainstream party and are attracting votes from all the three other parties.’

Survation interviewed  1,002 people online on Thursday and Friday.
