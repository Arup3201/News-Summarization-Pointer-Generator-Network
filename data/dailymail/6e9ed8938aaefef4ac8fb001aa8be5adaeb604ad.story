Aston Villa have made a move to sign Manchester City misfit Scott Sinclair on loan.

The 25-year-old has interest from QPR, Crystal Palace and Norwich but is leaning towards a move to Villa Park.

Scott Sinclair played just 10 times on loan at West Bromwich Albion last season

Sinclair has made four appearances this season, each as a late substitute, and is eager to get his career back on track.

He had an ill-fated loan spell with West Bromwich Albion last season but hopes to have better fortune with Paul Lambert.
