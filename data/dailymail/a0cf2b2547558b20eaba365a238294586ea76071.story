By the time you change your relationship status from 'in a relationship' to 'it's complicated', Facebook may already know.

According to a study by Cornell University, the social media site can tell how 'connected' a couple are by studying their groups of friends. 

The paper, called Romantic Partnerships and the Dispersion of Social Ties: A Network Analysis of Relationship Status on Facebook, employs graphs and algorithms to analyse relationships.

Facebook: According to a study by Cornell University, the social media site can tell how 'connected' a couple are by studying their groups of friends

Researchers looked at 1.3million Facebook users listed as being in a relationship and worked out how big their network of friends is and how many mutual friends they have.

The results, they say, mean people who have the same social circle on Facebook are less likely to stay together.

Relationships betwen different people on the site were taken into account including family members, co-workers, distant acquaintances as well as spouses.

The team behind the paper said 'dispersion', the way friends are linked together, was the way they measured how strong relationships are in their random sample.

'Our measure of dispersion looks not just at the number of mutual friends of two people,' the study says, 'but also at the network structure on these mutual friends; roughly, a link between two people has high dispersion when their mutual friends are not well connected to one another.'

It concluded that people with their own, separate, networks of friends were better in a relationship.

The report also says it doesn't matter how strong the tie to particular friends are, it is more important to have a wide range of people in your social circle.
