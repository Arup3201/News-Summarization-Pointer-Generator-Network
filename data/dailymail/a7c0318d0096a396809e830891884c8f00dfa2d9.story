Burberry is to stop using toxic chemicals in the manufacture of its clothing after residues were found in some children’s products.

The British designer label took the decision following tests by Greenpeace which found suspect chemicals in a shirt modelled by Romeo Beckham.

Tests commissioned by the campaigning group revealed the presence of hazardous chemicals, including hormone disrupting substances, in children’s clothes made by 12 brands such as Disney, Adidas and Primark.

Many of these chemicals are now widespread in the environment, following years of discharges into global waterways from clothing factories.

Ilze Smit, Detox campaigner at Greenpeace International said: ‘Burberry’s Detox commitment to rid us of these hazardous little monsters represents a new chapter in the story of toxic-free fashion.

‘In taking this landmark step, Burberry has listened to their customers’ demands and joins the ranks of brands acting on behalf of parents everywhere to give this toxic nightmare the happy ending it deserves.’

She added: ‘Burberry’s move raises the bar for the luxury sector. With the Fashion Weeks coming up, brands like Gucci, Versace and Louis Vuitton risk getting left behind.

‘From budget to luxury, we have a right to demand our clothes are free from hazardous chemicals and big brands have a responsibility to do something about it.’

The Daily Mail revealed last week how a £175 Burberry shirt modelled by Romeo Beckham in a fashion shoot for Vogue magazine has been found to be contaminated with toxic chemicals.

tests: The shirt was tested as part of the Greenpeace Detox campaign investigation and was found to contain a relatively high level - 780 mg/kg ¿ of nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs)

Eleven-year-old Romeo, who is the second of David and Victoria Beckham’s four children, was hired by Burberry last year to front a high profile marketing campaign.

Following his designer mother into the fashion world, he was hand-picked by Burberry’s chief creative officer, Christopher Bailey.

The campaign saw him wearing a purple metallic shirt alongside models Edie Campbell and Cara Delavingne as part of the Spring/Summer 2013 collection in a photo-shoot by the renowned Mario Testino.

The shirt was tested as part of the Greenpeace Detox campaign investigation and was found to contain a relatively high level - 780 mg/kg – of nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs).

NPEs are man-made chemicals that are widely used as surfactants or detergents by textiles manufacturers during the manufacture of the cloth.

Once released to the environment, NPEs degrade to nonylphenols (NP), which are known to be toxic and act as hormone disrupters. They will accumulate in the body over time.

There is no evidence that the levels of chemicals found would cause immediate harm to children wearing them, however Greenpeace argues they should be removed on a precautionary basis

The £175 shirt was made in Tunisia and purchased in the UK from the firm’s online store.

Graham Thompson, of Greenpeace, said: ‘The Mail’s reporting on this issue showed that even the super-rich can’t avoid exposure to hazardous chemicals without industry-wide action.

‘The industry know this, and everybody wants to do the right thing, but nobody wants to lead. Burberry have broken through that corporate inertia, they have a plan, it’s a plan which meets Greenpeace’s hopes, and it’s a plan which makes them industry leaders.’

Burberry has announced an action plan to begin removing suspect chemicals with immediate effect in a process that will take place between now and 2020.

It said: ‘Burberry’s long-term sustainability programme recognises the urgent need for eliminating industrial releases of all hazardous chemicals.

‘Burberry Group will work with other companies in the apparel sector and other brands we sell, as well as material suppliers, the broader chemical industry, NGOs and other stakeholders to achieve this goal.’
