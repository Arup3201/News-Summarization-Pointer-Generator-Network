Former referee: John Gardener, who bit his fingernails until they bled, died of a heart attack at the age of 40 after contracting septicaemia, an inquest heard

A former football referee who would bite his fingernails until they bled died of a heart attack at the age of 40 after contracting septicaemia, an inquest heard.

John Gardener would frequently chew the ends of his fingers to the point where they were 'often bleeding', resulting in a septic infection.

The former amateur football referee died from a heart attack, just days after his 40th birthday and two weeks after he was admitted to Wigan Infirmary, where he had undergone an operation to remove the tip of one of his fingers.

Bolton Coroner's Court was told that Mr Gardener's fingernails were in a constant poor condition and he lost a lot of feeling and sensation in them.

GP Dr Daniel Vernon told the hearing that Mr Gardener would probably not realise the severity of the condition because of this.

'John’s nails were always in bad condition,' said the doctor.

'It was likely they were often bleeding when he came to the doctors.'

Mr Gardener, who was diabetic, had also been treated for anxiety and depression in the years leading up to his death, the inquest was told.

He underwent surgery to remove the tip of his finger eight days after being admitted into hospital.

Before this he was treated with intravenous antibiotics and was monitored by medical staff daily to see if his condition improved as he expressed that he didn’t want to lose his finger.

The inquest heard that Mr Gardener, from Wigan, Lancashire, showed signs of slow but gradual improvement and did not display any signs of high temperature or fevers.

Consultant hand and orthopaedic surgeon Mr Chye Ng said he was as shocked by his patient’s sudden death on September 22 last year as the family were.

'The passing of John Gardener was really upsetting and shocking for all of the team,' said Mr Ng.

The court was told how in 2011 he also underwent an operation to amputate his lower right leg after he contracted leg ulcers - a not uncommon problem among diabetics.

'We would like to extend our sincere sympathies to the family and friends of Mr Gardener,' said a spokesman from Wrightington Wigan and Leigh Hospital Trust (WWL).

'The Trust always strives to provide safe, effective and compassionate care to all patients.

'It is clear from the evidence given at the inquest that Mr Gardener received a high standard of treatment throughout the time he was under our care.'

Recording a narrative verdict, coroner Alan Walsh said: 'This is a death of great sadness to everybody that somebody in this situation could just die so suddenly.'

He added: 'I believe he had a difficult life after being diagnosed with diabetes at just 10 months old and not only this, he had to come to terms with self-injecting himself twice a day.

'And then he had problems with leg ulcers and problems after surgery because of this.'

Following the hearing Mr Gardener's mother Jean said in a statement that she had 'concerns' about her son's hospital treatment, and had instructed solicitors to investigate a claim to determine whether his treatment and surgery for the removal of the tip of his finger was adequate.

'According to his mother Jean, John felt as though his medical condition was not being taken seriously, his family said in a statement released by EAD Solicitors.

'This matter is the subject of an ongoing investigation by EAD Solicitors.'

Septicaemia is another name for blood poisoning and refers to a bacterial infection of the blood, whereas sepsis, which can affect the whole body including organs, can also be caused by viral or fungal infections.

The life-threatening illness is caused by the body overreacting to an infection, setting off a series of reactions that can lead to inflammation and blood clotting.

Symptoms usually develop quickly and include:

In severe cases patients may also feel dizzy when they stand up, be confused or disorientated and suffer from nausea and vomiting.

Although anybody can develop sepsis from a minor infection, those with a medical condtion that weakens their immune system, who are already in hospital with a serious illness and those who have just had surgery or who have wounds or injuries as a result of an accident are more at risk.

Severe sepsis occurs when the body’s response to infection has started to interfere with the function of vital organs, such as the heart, kidneys, lungs or liver, while septic shock occurs in severe cases of sepsis, when your blood pressure drops to a dangerously low level, preventing your vital organs from receiving enough oxygenated blood.

If it is not treated, sepsis can progress from uncomplicated sepsis to septic shock and can eventually lead to multiple organ failure and death.

Severe sepsis and septic shock are considered medical emergencies and normally require admission to an intensive care unit, where the body’s organs can be supported while the infection is treated.

Because of problems with vital organs, people with severe sepsis are likely to be very ill, and approximately 30-50per cent will die as a result of the condition.

It is estimated that every year in the UK there are over 30,000 cases of severe sepsis, and the number seems to be rising.
