An overweight man with a knack for keeping a football in the air has become the latest internet sensation after footage showing him playing keepy-uppy were posted online.

The 46-second clip, apparently taken on a mobile phone, shows the man uses his head, knees and shoulders to keep the football up in the air as he practises on a rain-soaked patch of tarmac near the docks in Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire.

And today the man, who was identified as Andrew Cassidy, 50, said he had been invited to Dubai to take part in the World Freestyle Football Championships after the footage was spotted online.

Mr Cassidy has been a well-known figure in the Welsh town for more than a decade, but when new footage showing him keeping the ball up for nearly a minute was posted on the Spotted: Milford Haven Facebook page at the weekend, his reputation went global as football fans the world over marvelled at his skills.

The clip shows him giving an impressive display likened by one website to that of footballing legend Diego Maradona, rolling the ball around his neck and shoulders without touching it.

The footage, which is set to Rihanna singing We Found Love, was filmed near the docks in Milford Haven by some passers-by who spotted him from their car.

Initially people assumed it was a hoax or a clever marketing stunt, but this afternoon Mr Cassidy spoke out about his hidden talent.

He said: 'It's crazy to think that so many people have seen my skills - this is just what I do.  Sometimes kids will have a kick around with me but they always leave after I've shown them up.'

He said he started kicking the ball around after he lost his job as a fisherman in 2002, and now spends two hours a day practising in the car park.

Mr Cassidy added: 'I'm quite agile for a big guy and I've got good hand-eye coordination, balance and timing.

'I'm
 pretty good even though I've got a lot of blubber on me: it's just a 
matter of practice and I've got plenty of time on my hands for that.'

Now
 the organisers of the World Freestyle Football Championships have 
invited him to star in their opening ceremony in Dubai next month.  They will fly him over
 first class, put him up in a world-class hotel, and pay him Â£200 a day 
while he is there.

A spokesman said: 'He's a sensation - you can't take your eyes off him.'

Mr Cassidy spends two hours a day 'working up a sweat' by practising his astonishing football skills

Lee Day, news editor of local paper the Western Telegraph, told MailOnline Mr Cassidy was a well-known character.

He
 said: 'He's been doing it down by the docks for years - I used to see 
him years ago, but judging from the footage, he's got a lot better since
 then.'

Comments on the Facebook page, entitled You Wouldn't Believe How Good This Guy Is, are mostly appreciative, with one saying: 'Flat out legend.  We saw him fall over one day followed by a quick look around to see if anyone saw and yup, we did.'

Another online fan wrote: 'Ronaldo? Maradona? Mick Quinn?  You may now add 'fat guy from Pembrokeshire' to that exalted list.'
