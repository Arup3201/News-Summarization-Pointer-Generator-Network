Ryder Cup star Patrick Reed has apologised for an ‘unacceptable’ foul-mouthed outburst on the opening day of the WGC-HSBC Champions Event in Shanghai, but is still set to be punished by the PGA Tour.

Reed finished four off the pace at Sheshan International after a round of 71, but the American faces a hefty fine after being caught on camera swearing and using language which could be interpreted as homophobic.

Television commentators apologised after Reed was heard saying to himself, ‘Nice f****** three-putt you f****** f****t,’ after he bogeyed the first hole, having started on the ninth.

The 24-year-old apologised on Twitter later in the day, writing: ‘I’m sorry for using offensive language today in China. My passion to play well got the best of me and my word choice was unacceptable.’

A PGA Tour spokesman said: ‘The PGA Tour’s regulations prohibit the use of obscene language on the golf course. The PGA Tour will deal with this matter internally in accordance with its regulations.’

Reed’s playing partner Graeme McDowell finished with a two-shot lead in Shanghai after a five-under-par 67. The Irishman had a blistering start, and was seven under after 12 holes.

He then failed to get up and down from a bunker on the fourth and paid the price for what he called ‘a comedy of errors’ on the par-five eighth, where he missed his only fairway of the day and also pulled his approach left of the green.

‘A key to this golf course is driving the ball well,’ McDowell said, ‘and I only missed one fairway. The greens are in fantastic shape and I putted very well.

‘Seven under par through 12 was a beautiful start. I dropped a couple coming in, but all in all I am very, very pleased with five under par on what was a reasonably tricky day.’

McDowell believes he is well placed to take advantage of the lucrative events at the end of the season.

‘This has always been a part of the season I’ve enjoyed,’ the 35-year-old said. ‘I take three or four weeks off around the Ryder Cup and prepare myself for this and I’ve normally played well.’

Martin Kaymer’s 69 was matched by England’s Tommy Fleetwood. The pair share second place with South African Tim Clark and American trio Rickie Fowler, Chris Kirk and Brandt Snedeker.
