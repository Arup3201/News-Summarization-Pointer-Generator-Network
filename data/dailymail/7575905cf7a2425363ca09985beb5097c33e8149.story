Tragic: Haley Verzani was fatally pinned to her bed when the 100-foot-tall fir tree, crashed down onto her house in the Northern California town of Arnold

An 8-year-old girl was killed in a freak accident on Sunday when a storm-weakened tree collapsed onto the home where she was in bed asleep, authorities said.

Haley Verzani was fatally pinned to her bed when the 100-foot-tall fir tree, crashed down onto her house in the Northern California town of Arnold.

The fir, which was three-feet in diameter fell across a creek during a night of unexpected heavy snow.

The girl’s mother, Lindsey Jacoby, 
and the mother’s boyfriend were inside the home at the time the tree 
fell, they were able to make it out without being seriously hurt.

The family told Fox 40 they noticed
the towering pine tree was leaning and looked like it was about to 
fall, but they said it was growing on someone else's property so they 
didn't know what to do about it.

'We just didn't know it was going to fall on her like that,' said Kim Christopher, cousin of the victim.

'The whole house is torn up,' she said. 'It's awful'.

Christopher added that Verzani, a third grader at Hazel Fischer Elementary School in White Pines, 'liked to bake and dress-up... princess and stuff.'

Fatal: The fir tree which collapsed onto the house was 100-foot tall and three-foot in diameter

Unexpected: The tree sliced through the house in what has been the worst storm of the winter in the area

Firefighters responding to a 911 call 
maneuvered through unplowed snow and had to call in heavy equipment to 
lift the tree off the house, a process that took an hour, Ebbetts Pass 
Fire District Chief David Baugher said.

The fierce storm was the worst seen in Southern California so far this winter, leaving thousands without power on Monday. 

Severe winter storms have caused havoc in the past in Ebbetts Pass, a mountainous section of Calaveras County about 30 miles northwest of Yosemite National Park.

During the week of Thanksgiving 2010, snow led to 250 calls about fallen trees, though there were no fatalities, Baugher said. Federal authorities at the time declared Ebbetts Pass a disaster area.

The storm that rolled into the region Saturday on the eve of spring followed a dry winter caused by La Nina, a condition in which the surface temperature of the Pacific Ocean is lower than normal.

‘It was very unusual because it was probably the first actual major storm for this year,’ said Stuart Seto, a National Weather Service forecaster.

Snow was to blame in the deaths of a skier and a snowboarder in the Sierra, where storms dropped more than 5 feet of snow on some ski resorts over the past few days.

A 30-year-old snowboarder on Sunday fell head first into the snow at China Peak Mountain Resort northeast of Fresno and suffocated, said resort owner Tim Cohee.

Fresno County Deputy Coroner Kelly Wiefel told the Mariposa Gazette that the victim was Kynan Stanners, a California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection firefighter who lived in the Bass Lake area.

In Northern California, a skier fell into a hole created by an underflow of water at the Sierra-at-Tahoe resort early Sunday afternoon.

The El Dorado County Sheriff's department said the victim was 54-year-old Yiwei Hu of Gold River.

Skiing or snowboarding in deep snow always carries risks, and anyone hitting the slopes in those conditions should take proper precautions, said Steven Hemphill, Sierra-at-Tahoe spokesman.

‘Always partner up, be with a partner at all times,’ Hemphill said.

At Kirkwood Mountain Resort, a skier was taken to a hospital after being injured in a small avalanche, said resort spokesman Michael Dalzell, adding that he didn't know the extent of the person's injury.

The National Weather Service predicted more snow was likely to fall in the Lake Tahoe area early Tuesday.
