An ‘eccentric’ hotelier has hit back after a scathing online reviewer who claims she ruined his romantic Valentine weekend wrote: ‘Basil Fawlty is the perfect host compared to this place’

Shirley Bothroyd, who worked as a top London barrister before taking over
the seafront Bay Hotel in Teignmouth, Devon, a few months ago, dismissed large
chunks of the review as exaggerated or not true - but conceded that about 50 per cent
of it could be accurate.

The 55-year-old denied she was very drunk and swearing profusely during
a Valentine's night dinner, but freely admitted she was ‘eccentric, extroverted
and loud, even when sober.’

The review left on Tripadvisor said: 'Basil Fawlty is the perfect host compared to this place'

The TripAdvisor reviewer, only identified as Michael W of
Torquay, said he booked in for a Valentine and wedding anniversary weekend.

When they went down for dinner, a woman who had
earlier been in the bar ‘intoxicated, loud and swearing like a trooper’, was
also in the restaurant with a man they assumed was her partner.

‘While waiting for our meal the very drunk lady staggered
over and tried to communicate to us that the lighting was too dark and should
be brighter, She turned a lamp on, almost falling into my wife’s lap and in the
process knocking a picture off the wall.

‘So while we were eating our meal, which was really good, we
were “entertained” by our fellow diner dropping things on the floor, shouting
at her partner and generally becoming annoying.

The 55-year old conceded that around 50 per cent of the review could be true

‘After a short while she grew tired of waiting for her meal,
so she went downstairs to the kitchen and promptly began a barrage of foul
mouthed abuse. After a few minutes of very industrial language she left the
building, the very embarrassed waiter / manager came in to apologise for her
behaviour and said that unfortunately it was not unusual as she was the owner.

‘Well I didn’t see that coming. However, she was gone from
the building and we finished our lovely meal in peace.’

The reviewer continued that they were kept awake by loud
music from the bar during the night, and he had to go down at 2.30am to ask for
it to be turned off.

During breakfast, the owner was in the bar ‘looking better
than I was feeling’. They left for another hotel after refusing to pay for the
dinner, claiming their anniversary weekend had been ruined. He did praise the
staff saying they ‘deserved a medal.’

Shown the review, Ms Bothroyd, responded she had ‘no
specific recollection’ of everything said to have occurred, but pointed out
that her ‘partner’ was in fact her 24 year-old son, on a visit from China where
he lives.

‘Of course I had a few drinks - I was excited to see him and
we had a great time. I can be a bit raucous, but I was not drunk.

The owner of the Bay Horse said the review could have been left by a disgruntled member of staff

‘I did have strong words with the kitchen because we were
waiting too long for our dinner, and I told them in no uncertain terms that it
was not good enough.

‘I do know that some former staff who left have been
spreading all sorts of nasty rumours about me and the hotel, claiming that we
are closing, that I’ve had a nervous breakdown and staff are walking out. There
is no truth in any of it.

‘I take is as a compliment to be compared to Basil Fawlty -
he had a great sense of humour, just like me, and it seemed a fun place to
stay,’ she quipped.

‘I am nicknamed the “rottweiller with lip gloss” in the
courts, and I do like a drink and keeping my guests entertained. I’m also known
as “Marmite” - you either love me or hate me.

‘This review could be the work of a disgruntled former
member of staff being malicious. I never read these online things.’

She said she has lost £2,000 in cancelled bookings since the scathing review - which she calls "The Valentine's Day Massacre".

Ms Bothroyd, who spent 30 years at the top of her profession
handling many high profile cases, bought the Bay for about £1.5million from a
£2million nest egg she built up as a lawyer.

‘I looked at 37 hotels in Devon and Cornwall, because I
wanted something to do in my retirement and the money was earning very little
in interest.

The 55-year-old said people also call her Marmite, because you either love her or hate her

‘We have some loyal locals who pop in regularly, and they
all seem to love the jolly atmosphere here.’

The current staff all had nothing but praise for Ms
Bothroyd, and one said: ‘She gave me a job when I really needed it, and she is
lovely to work for. There is rarely a dull moment here.’

In January, two former members of staff had been arrested
and bailed pending police investigations into alleged fraud and identity after
a complaint by Ms Bothroyd.

Ms Bothroyd still works out of London's Littleton Chambers, which lists her as a specialist in employment law who has acted in number of High Court cases and tribunals.

Its website describes her as the "queen of injunctions", and says she has been described by legal directories as a "tenacious cross examiner."

It goes on to say: "Shirley's style is direct and down to earth. Clients appreciate her clear and approachable manner. Her advice is practical and commercially aware."

In one of her more high-profile cases she secured an undisclosed settlement for Sharan Sandhu, a journalist who sued the BBC for sex and race discrimination in 2000.
