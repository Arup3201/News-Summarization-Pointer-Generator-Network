Around 200 bears were killed on the first day of a controversial black bear hunt that animal rights groups had done all they could to block.

New Jersey state officials have said the six-day hunt is needed to reduce the state's bruin population, now estimated at about 3,400.

But critics say the state’s bear management policy is flawed and is illogical, while animal advocates went to court in an attempt to block the hunt.

Dead: New Jersey state officials have said the six-day hunt is needed to reduce the state's bruin population, now estimated at about 3,400

They were rebuffed last week by an appeals court and spent part of Monday gaining permission to protest at various bear check stations.

The group wanted to protest at the Franklin bear check station in Sussex County, which they said was the most visible spot for their message.

But wildlife officials wanted to keep them away from there over safety concerns, noting its limited space and location on a major highway.

A state Superior Court ruled up to 25 people could protest there and gave demonstrators the right to have larger protests at two other weigh stations.

Shooting: Around 6,500 hunters have been given permits for this year's hunt, allowing them to patrol 1,000 sq miles of northern New Jersey

One protester was arrested at the Franklin site for refusing to move from a restricted area. Officials said the hunt's first day went smoothly.

The hunt comes with rules on weapons, ammunition and transportation. Officials weigh the bears and take skin, blood and tooth samples.

About 150 bears had been processed by late afternoon, with 200 in total expected by nightfall, the environmental officials said.

Officials say this area has one of the highest population densities of black bears in the U.S. But critics are not happy with the hunt taking place.

'A bear hunt doesn't protect property, a bear hunt doesn't protect public safety and the bear hunt will not reduce the population'

Angie Metler

‘A bear hunt doesn't solve nuisance complaints,’ Bear Education and Resource Group spokesman Angie Metler told Fox News.

‘A bear hunt doesn't protect property, a bear hunt doesn't protect public safety and the bear hunt will not reduce the population.’

Susan Kehoe, another protester, said there is ‘no need for the hunt’ and said it’s all about a ‘trophy hunt’ rather than safety.

But state officials say there has been a rise in ‘public complaints about bear and human encounters’ and so the population must be reduced.

'I don't think you want to come home and find a black bear in your kitchen when you are ready to make dinner'

Larry Rudolph

Dr Larry Rudolph, of Safari Club International, said that bears can ‘definitely be a danger in New Jersey this year’.

‘New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection cited almost 3,000 instances where there was human-bear interface,’ he told Fox News.

Forty-six of those involved bears going into a residential home, he said.

‘I don't think you want to come home and find a black bear in your kitchen when you are ready to make dinner,' Dr Rudolph added.
