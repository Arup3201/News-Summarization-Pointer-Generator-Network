A taxi driver killed his baby son – apparently in revenge for his ex-partner withholding access – and then committed suicide.

Paul McBride, 39, is believed to have smothered six-month-old Ollie before hanging himself.

McBride’s body was found at his mother’s house in Preston by his sister Michelle shortly after 6pm on Wednesday evening.

Tragic: Six-month-old Ollie McBride was taken to hospital in Lancashire, Preston, where he was later pronounced dead

Ollie was discovered unconscious and unresponsive and despite efforts to revive him by paramedics he was later pronounced dead.

Mother: Michaela Swain said, 'No words I could ever write could express how much I love my beautiful baby boy Ollie.'

McBride’s sister had joined a police 
search after his former partner, Michaela Swain, 35, contacted officers 
to report that he had failed to return Ollie at the agreed time.

Last night it emerged the couple had recently split after a series of furious  rows and had been living apart for  some weeks.

It is understood police had been 
called to their home on more than one occasion after reports Miss Swain 
had been the victim of domestic violence.

Detectives investigating the tragedy 
will examine the theory that McBride killed his son and then took his 
own life  to spite Miss Swain.

A senior police source said: ‘It 
appears the couple had been involved in a very acrimonious break-up and 
the mother did not allow him to see his son a lot.

'They were constantly 
rowing about it but had come to some loose agreement that Paul could 
take Ollie out for a few hours.

‘He was very unhappy at this arrangement and it appears that if he wasn’t allowed to have his son then no one could have him.’

Last night Miss Swain, who was being 
comforted by friends and family at her home in Ribbleton, Preston, paid 
tribute to her son.

In a statement issued by police, she wrote: ‘No 
words I could ever write could express how much I love my beautiful baby
boy Ollie. Goodnight sweetheart, sweet dreams. Mummy loves you. Moo 
moo. X’

Investigation: Detectives are probing the deaths after the grim discovery

Detective Superintendent Neil Esseen,
who is leading the investigation, said: ‘Whether it is a revenge attack
is too early to say, that would be speculation. We will be looking at 
all sorts of theories.

‘The mother is obviously very 
distraught and she is being comforted by trained specialist officers. It
is vitally important that we are able to tell the mother what has 
happened to her baby.’

Neighbours Alma and John Attle, who 
have known McBride since he was a child, said they were in total shock 
over what had taken place.Mrs Attle said: ‘Paul is the last person you 
would have thought would do this. He was a very jokey sort of lad – 
always full of jokes.

‘We saw Michelle and another relative
go into the house and then a few minutes later there were police and 
ambulances everywhere.

‘Paramedics rushed the baby out of the house and into the ambulance, and at that stage we didn’t know if he was dead or alive.

‘We asked Michelle what had happened 
and she said that Paul had hanged himself. She said that the police had 
been looking for him earlier but she didn’t say why.

‘She was in a terrible state and wasn’t very coherent. It is a terrible thing to have happened.’
