Brentford made it five wins from five in November with a dominant display at Griffin Park, exacting a spot of revenge on the team that pipped them to the League One title last season.

Four well-worked goals, scored by Alan Judge, Stuart Dallas, Jota and Wolverhampton-born Andre Gray, saw off Wolves, as Mark Warburton's side continued their remarkable rise up the SkyBet Championship.

The Bees sit in third with 19 games played, and are just a single point behind Derby at the top of the table.

George Saville was one of four changes made by Wolves boss Kenny Jackett, as they looked to arrest a slump in form that had seen them lose their last three games.

Saville started in central midfield against his former side and was on the receiving end of some full-blooded challenges in the early stages.

Not that he was afraid to give it back, mind. The former Chelsea man landed a reducer on close friend Jonathan Douglas before picking up the first yellow of the game for a cynical foul on Jon Toral.

The visitors, despite not seeing as much of the ball as Brentford in the early stages, posed the bigger threat, particularly Bakary Sako, the Malian winger celebrating his 100th appearance for the club.

Some diamond-encrusted commemorative boots to mark his century were confined to the warm-up due to Football League regulations, but his replacement white pair nearly produced the goods when he whipped a free-kick on to the roof of the net from 35 yards early on. 

And then, in the 16th minute, Danny Graham glanced a header on to the underside of the crossbar following decent play by Rajiv van La Parra down the left.

Brentford broke the deadlock against the run of play, Alan Judge timing his run brilliantly to meet Jon Toral's cut-back from the left side of the box, drift past the two Wolves centre backs, and prod a finish past Ikeme and into the far corner.

Wolves were immediately on the hunt for an equaliser, and so nearly got it when Sako's rasping strike was parried away by the alert David Button at his near post.

Warburton's team, doing what they could to use Andre Gray's pace to stretch Wolves, nearly doubled their lead in the 34th minute.

The striker, released by his home-town club Wolves at 13, raced past Matt Doherty and dinked an inviting ball to the back post, but no Brentford player could touch it beyond Ikeme.

After a tepid start to the second half, Stuart Dallas' introduction for Brentford sparked the hosts into life. One of his first involvements was to set Judge clear, only for the midfielder's delicate lob to be clawed away by Ikeme.

Five minutes later Dallas made it 2-0, with a crisp strike after some eyecatching footwork from Alex Pritchard on the edge of the Wolves box. The attacker, on loan from Tottenham, jinked away from Rowe and Batth and fired a pass to the sub at the back post, and he slid the ball calmly into the back of the net.

On 82 minutes, Gray, who looked so dangerous when given time and space to run in to by Wolves, added a third with thumping effort into the roof of the net, before Jota completed the scoring in added time with a neat finish under Ikeme.

Before the game, talk of where Brentford would play if they secured promotion to England's top tier was brushed aside by Warburton. After another maximum return, their fans, at least, will be beginning to dream.
