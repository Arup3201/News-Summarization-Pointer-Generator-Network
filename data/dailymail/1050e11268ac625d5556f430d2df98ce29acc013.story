A businessman who was determined to show his nine-year-old son's driving talent to the world is in trouble with police - after letting him take his Ferrari F430 for a spin.

Muhammad Nizam let his son take the wheel of the £127,000 supercar on his birthday - with nobody else in the vehicle except for his six-year-old brother.

The boy drove it for several hundred metres along a private road - all filmed by his proud family, who then uploaded the footage to YouTube.

Nizam, who lives in Thrissur, India, and 
owns several businesses in India and other countries, now finds himself accused 
of allowing his underage son to drive a vehicle.

The
 Kerala Police have registered a case against Nizam under the Juvenile 
Justice Act and Motor Vehicles Act for uploading a video of an illegal 
act, sending out a wrong message to the world and allowing a child to 
drive a vehicle.

Though the police said the vehicle will be taken into custody, sources said they are yet to seize the vehicle. 

The incident occurred on April 6, on the ninth birthday of the elder son of Nizam.

The youngster pulls up after his drive apparently proud of his achievement, though police say he is not the only under-aged driver to be found on Kerala roads at the wheel of an expensive car

The video has now gone viral on You Tube
