This is the astonishing moment a bungling thief used his car as a battering ram to smash down a parking meter before struggling to lift the heavy machine in to the vehicle.

Wesley Bristow, of Oldswinford, West Midlands, is then seen driving off with sparks flying underneath his Peugeot which is scraping the ground because of the weight of his stolen haul.

The 25-year-old thief and another unidentified man were completely unaware they were being watched on CCTV cameras as they targeted the dispenser in an Asda car park in February this year.

Clear footage shows Bristow ramming his car at the pay-and-display machine to break it away from its concrete base - even tearing part of the bodywork off in the process.

Along with his accomplice, he finally uproots the machine and the pair then struggle to fit it in to the back seat of his Peugeot.

The father-of-four then speeds off in his car just as police - who had been alerted by security staff watching the CCTV cameras - arrive at the scene.

Bristow led officers on a mile-long pursuit at speeds of up to 55mph before he lost control of the car, demolished a bollard and crashed into a wall.

He was arrested and admitted theft, criminal damage and dangerous driving along with the breach of a suspended sentence imposed eight months ago for drug dealing.

Wesley Bristow was jailed for two years by Wolverhampton Crown Court and received a further driving ban of two years

Wolverhampton Crown Court jailed Bristow for two years and also banned him from driving for two years following Friday's hearing.

Judge Nicholas Webb said: 'The vehicle was in a very dangerous condition and it was only good fortune that you did not lose control at a spot where other people were about.'

The court heard Bristow and his accomplice struck at the car park of an Asda supermarket in Brierley Hill, West Midlands, at 5.45am on February 23.

Security guards watching the CCTV cameras saw the pair - who were both wearing hoods - attempt to knock it to the ground.

The video shows the men knock the machine sideways only to discover it is tethered underground by a length of steel cable.

The footage shows them finally managing to get it on its side before they realise it is tethered by an underground length of cable.

Bristow's accomplice then holds the machine upright while he uses his Peugeot as a battering ram to smash the machine from its base.

The duo then manhandle the dispenser into the car by forcing it through the passenger side door after failing to get it through the window.

The three minute and six second long video then shows Bristow accelerating away from the scene with sparks flying underneath his car which is scraping the ground.

Prosecutor Kevin Jones told the court Bristow left the scene moments before police arrived and his accomplice was seen climbing into another car which was driven away by a third man.

He said: 'The machine that contained up to £1,000 was recovered.

'When he (Bristow) was detained both the mobile phones in his possession were ringing with calls from the same number.

'Police officers have confirmed that the caller was somebody who would put pressure on people.'

The court heard the whole incident caused around £5,500 worth of damage to the Asda car park.

Defending Bristow, Devon Small said he was pressured into stealing the parking meter because of a drug debt he owed to the other men at the scene.

He added: 'The car he was driving belonged to one of the two men who had threatened violence if he did not steal the ticket machine to repay a drug debt he owed to them.'
