Stretching across five terraced houses and using more than 15,000 bulbs, this is the Frozen-inspired Christmas lights display which drew a crowd so large for the switch on police had to close the road.

The display, inspired by the Disney smash-hit movie was set up by father-of-five Andy McNab, who installed the lights outside his home in Dagenham, Essex.

It took the 47-year-old a month to put up the display, which boast of 15,000 bulbs and stretches across the row of houses.

But despite the lights paying tribute to the film, which tells the story of Princess Elsa, Mr McNab admits he has never actually seen the highly successful and popular children's movie.

On Monday night, Mr McNab held the big switch on for the display in the Dagenham street, which saw more than 1,500 people turn up.

The crowds were so large that police were even called in to close the road and direct traffic.

The lights are switched on daily as soon as it gets dark and go off around 11pm but Mr McNab says that they 'still get cars turning up at midnight'.

The grandfather was encouraged by family and friends to bring back the annual charity light displays that he created to amuse his children when they were younger - but on a much grander scale.

He said: 'I was just talking, as you do, and people kept saying "why don't you do it" and now that I've got the grandchildren I thought that I might as well.

The display has been inspired by the smash hit Disney movie Frozen, but Mr McNab admits he has never actually seen the highly successful children's film 

On Monday night, the display had its official switch on and drew crowds of more than 1,500 people, which meant police had to close the road outside

Mr McNab's family, pictured, urged him to put up the lights after he created annual charity displays when his children were younger 

'It was just one of those funny things where I thought it was about time.

'Now we have people turning up with their kids saying that they remember that they used come with their parents.'

But Mr McNab and his wife, Lesley, didn't give themselves much time to get their display up and running.

He admiited: 'In previous years we have started at the end of August or the beginning of September but we first discussed it at Halloween and only had about a month to get it sorted.

The Dagenham display was based on the hit Disney film Frozen, which tells the story of Princess Elsa, pictured 

'But it has ended up being the biggest display that we've done yet.'

Mr McNab has been backed by Barking Fire Station as they try to generate cash for the Children's Burns Club at Broomfield Hospital, Chelmsford.

Visitors to the display are being urged to make donations or buy raffle tickets for a chance to win one of a range of prizes donated by local businesses.
