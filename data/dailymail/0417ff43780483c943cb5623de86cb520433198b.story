The search for an Australian grandmother, who has been missing for more than a month in India, has been ramped up, as local authorities investigate her 'unusual' disappearance.

Toni Anne Ludgate, 75, was on a regular trip to India doing charity work in an ashram when her family became concerned after they had lost all communications with her.

The Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra have sent consular officials to Bangalore, where Ms Ludgate was last seen, to help local police with their investigation.

The Sai Baba search team (pictured) have been on the ground, following leads to sourced as much information about Toni Ludgate's disappearance as possible 

Her daughter, best selling author Traci Harding, who last spoke to her mother on her birthday on August 28, says she was reportedly last seen getting out of a cab with an older lady on September 23.

'The landlord of the lodge she was staying at, had reported she paid an extra five days rent before leaving in a cab with an older lady in Bangalore. After that we never heard from her,' she said.

Ms Ludgate's bank account had also not been touched and her ticket home to Sydney  was found in the apartment.

'I think when she didn’t get back to unit there were alarm bells.'

'That part of India has recently been hit by a tornado, communications have been down, so there's a lot going on.'

Friends of Ms Ludgate at the Prasanthi Nilayam (Abode of Supreme Peace) ashram, where she regularly did volunteer work, have been on the case to find her since concerns were raised.

Ms Harding says they took up the case, followed up on leads and even got their legal team involved.

'They really have been fantastic,' she said.

She said they felt the crime scene, where her mother was last seen, had not been handled properly as the local authorities didn't have the capabilities to do an extensive search.

That's when the call for help came out, for higher authorities to get involved.

'DFAT Canberra have come to the party,' said Ms Harding. 

'Also a couple of days ago, Indian officers were notified and are seeking answers.' 

'Head of the state (India) is looking at the case himself, sending his own team to reassess information. They have had a meeting with the police commissioner but I haven’t heard the outcome, just waiting on the investigation to advance,' she said.

'The past few days what they've been doing in India and Australia, I couldn't ask for a better reaction.'

'Consular officials are overseas in Chennai dealing with it, they have gone to Bangalore with the commissioner to be on the ground.'

Earlier Ms Ludgate's family created a petition on change.org to persuade Foreign Minister Julie Bishop to ­approach the Indian government and try to get Indian federal police involved. 

It clearly worked with the government department now doing everything they can to follow on on the grandmother's disappearance.

'She was a complete sweetheart, when we were young everybody came to our place, they were always welcome, she was always taking care of people,' said Traci Harding (pictured right) of her mother Toni (pictured middle)

A facebook page called 'Find Toni Ludgate' has also been put up to inform friends and loved one of any information that comes forward

A facebook page called 'Find Toni Ludgate' has also been put up to inform friends and loved one of any information that comes forward. 

'Mum touched the lives of so many people, so we wanted to create somewhere for people to express their concerns, for people who knew her,' said Ms Harding.

'She was a complete sweetheart, when we were young everybody came to our place, they were always welcome, she was always taking care of people.'

While not knowing what has happened to her mother, Ms Harding says she's trying not to panic and think positively that they will eventually find her.

'You can't just collapse into misery, your useless to everyone, I am dealing with it, like it is as a case.'

'There's been a huge outpouring of emotion from other people, which really gets you, but I've been dealing with it day by day and really staying calm,' she said.

'I hope we hear from her soon, that’s the hope.'
