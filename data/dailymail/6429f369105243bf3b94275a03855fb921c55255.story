Children of the 80s will remember the classic, and sometimes infuriating, childhood game of Screwball Scramble.

It involved moving a pinball over an obstacle course of steps, swings and slides and remains popular today.

But now a group of Lego enthusiasts have created an amazing modern-day version complete with escalators, robotic hands and even a pneumatic ramp.

The Great Ball Contraption, pictured, was built by members of the Tsukuba Lego Circle in Japan. Each section is made from an individual 'module' with various motorised arms, scoops, lifts, escalators, robotic hands and corkscrews that transport the balls from one module to another

Each module should have an ‘in’ basket, and should move balls to the next module's ‘in’ basket.

This basket should be at least 10 studs wide, by 10 studs long and high, with an 8x8 opening.

The ‘in’ basket should be built onto the left-hand side of a module, and the output should go to the right.

Each module should be able to accept balls at an average rate of 1 per second and balls can be passed one at a time, or in a batch of fewer than 30 balls.  

Called the Lego Great Ball Contraption, the mechanical device is said to contain around 11,000 bricks and is made up of modules submitted by various members of a Japanese Lego fan club.

One of the largest stretches was built by 22-year-old Kawaguchi Akiyuki from Shimane. 

He built 17 of the modules using around 3,000 bricks.

It took him almost 600 hours to build, and his modules include a ball factory followed by a zigzag stair and lift.

A pneumatic ramp scoops the balls into a cup and the balls are then thrown towards a miniature basketball hoop. The action is so precise that the majority of the balls go through the hoop. 

A mechanical train then picks these balls up and moves them to a spiral lift before a mechanical plastic fork scoops the balls from the lift puts them onto a moving step.

A belt conveyor then moves the balls to the next module.

Other members who contributed to the construction include Fin, Makoto Uda, Toise, Matk, Momonga, Kosaku-jin, Katsumata and Yattaran also contributed modules.

Akiyuki has been building with Lego since he was a child and said during a Blocumentary - a documentary series that interviews Lego fans on YouTube: ‘Since I was little I’ve always like watching Lego that move. I like the movements that look like robots.’

A great ball contraption or (GBC) is a machine which moves small balls from one module and passes them to another module.

It is based on the Rube Goldberg machine, which is a contraption that performs a simple task in a complex way, usually involving a chain reaction of events to take place in order to perform this task.

Lego enthusiasts around the world make GBC and there are even rules. For example, each module should have an ‘in’ basket, and should move balls to the next module's ‘in’ basket.

This basket should be at least 10 studs wide, by 10 studs long and high, with an 8x8 opening.

Kawaguchi Akiyuki continued: ‘When you start building GBC it’s very hard to come up with your own original creation. I think you should start by copying other people’s modules. That way you can learn faster. 

You shouldn’t think about it too much, you should just start moving your hands and building. You will make mistakes but eventually you’ll get it to work.‘
