Modern sprawling metropolises with their high-rise buildings and bustling streets might at first glance appear very different from the cities that existed 2,500 years ago.

New research, however, suggests that New York and London may not be all that different from the ancient cities built by civilisations like the Aztecs.

Scientists have found that regardless of their location and origins in history, cities tend to grow in similar and predictable ways.

Ruins of Teotihuacan (pictured), the capital of the Aztec empire, looks very different from modern cities  but the new research suggest it grew according to the same basic formula that determines city growth today

They claim this is because the social and economic drivers behind a city's expansion have been the same though out history.

Urban areas are more likely to be hit by frequent thunderstorms than rural areas of the same size, according to a new study. 

Researchers at Northern Illinois University studied radar data to pinpoint where thunderstorm initiations occurred across the southeast US between 1997 and 2013.

They found that urban areas such as Atlanta are five per cent more likely to be hit by thunderstorms, on a given day, than rural areas of the same size. 

Storms were more likely to hit these urbanised areas during warmer months, in July and August, in the late afternoon and early evening. And the study found more 'births' occurred during the week than at weekends. 

The scientists behind the work say that increased pollution in urban areas may be responsible to the increased frequency of storms.

Urban areas also create 'heat islands' that can lead to storm formation.

Concentrations of buildings also increase temperatures causing low pressures to form above cities, compared to high pressures in rural areas. 

This causes a so-called 'low-level atmospheric convergence', which forces air up into thunderstorms.

Buildings may also change the flow and direction of winds, which in turn changes pressure levels and affects the upward movement of air. 

Their research that much like modern cities, ancient settlements were also subject to the laws of 'urban scaling'.

This is where a city's population outpaces the development of infrastructure while its production of goods and services outpaces the population.

Dr Scott Ortman, an anthropologist at the University of Colorado Boulder and Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico, said: 'It was shocking and unbelievable.

'We were raised on a steady diet telling us that, thanks to capitalism, industrialization, and democracy, the modern world is radically different from worlds of the past. 

'What we found here is that the fundamental drivers of robust socioeconomic patterns in modern cities precede all that.'

Dr Ortman and his colleagues, whose work is published in the journal Science Advances, examined archaeological data from 4,000 sites in the area around Mexico City.

In the 1960s - before Mexico City's population began rapidly growing - surveyors examined all of the ancient settlements.

The data spanned more than 2000 years of history from 500BC - covering the period from the Mayans to the Aztec empire before European settlers arrived in the shape of the Spanish conquistadors.

The researchers used this to analyse the dimensions of hundreds of ancient temples and thousands of ancient houses to estimate populations and densities.

They were also able to estimate the size and construction rate of monuments and buildings, together with intensity of use, to predict the output of each city.

They found that the bigger the ancient settlement the more productive it was.

Manhattan (left) is seen as a classic example of how modern capitalism and industrialisation led to city growth, but the same drivers were also at work in ancient Mayan cities that have been reclaimed by the jungle

In the pre-Hispanic settlements around Mexico city, denser populations used space more efficiently, produced goods more rapidly and were more productive per household.

These results mirrored what the team have observed occurs in modern cities.

The researchers say that by allowing people to sustain social interactions on a daily basis, cities make it easier for populations to solve complicated problems.

Innovations like currency and literacy also tend to flow from cities and so help to speed up this process.

The skyline of London (above) may look different, but the way cities bring populations together plays a crucial part in the way they expand and evolve, something that has occurred since ancient times

The findings could help to explain why ancient civilisations from different parts of the world ended up producing cities that were surprisingly similar in structure.

Indeed, when Hernan Cortes saw the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan in 1521, he wrote to the Spanish king that the city was as big as Seville with surprisingly familiar boulevards, markets, canals, temples and courthouses.

Professor Luis Bettencourt, a researcher in complex systems at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico who was also involved in the work, said: 'Our results suggest that the general ingredients of productivity and population density in human societies run much deeper and have everything to do with the challenges and opportunities of organizing human social networks.'
