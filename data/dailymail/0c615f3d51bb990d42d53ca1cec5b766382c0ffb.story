Love them or hate them, wood pigeons are starting to rule the roost in towns and cities across the UK.

The bigger and hungrier cousin of the urban pigeon is being spotted in gardens in record numbers, with suburban lawns and bird tables particularly favoured.

A survey of bird lovers by the British Trust for Ornithology found wood pigeons, which are often accused of stealing food left out for smaller, more fragile birds, to have visited 87 per cent of gardens during a typical week this year.

This makes them more frequently sighted than robins, great tits or house sparrows.

In fact, the wood pigeon, which was once a strictly countryside bird, is developing such an affinity for city life that only blue tits and blackbirds were spotted more frequently.

If the trend continues, the wood pigeon could soon rule the roost.

Changing agricultural practices - often blamed for the demise of other wildlife - are thought to be behind the population boom.

In particular, increased planting of oil seed rape has provided the birds with large quantities of 'fresh greens' to help seem them through the winter.

As their numbers have increased, they have ventured more into urban areas, where, safe from farmers who view them as vermin, they appear to have enjoyed the easy pickings on bird tables and in feeders.

A spokesman for the BTO said: 'When it comes to gardens, wood pigeons prefer suburbia.

'Throughout the year, wood pigeons visit a greater proportion of suburban gardens than rural ones.

'Wood pigeons are persecuted in rural areas as an agricultural pest, so individuals may be more likely to visit suburban gardens, where they feel less threatened.

'Alternatively, bird table fare, which is more widely available in suburban gardens, might be particularly attractive, drawing the birds into gardens.'

However, not everyone is happy by the rise of the portly pigeons, which can be distinguished from those more traditionally seen in towns and cities by their bigger bodies and white collars.

They have voracious appetites and often hog the bird table, swiftly eating the treats left for smaller birds.

The BTO suggests buying seed mixes which are low on cereal, one the wood pigeon's favoured foods.

Cages placed around bird tables and feeders will allow access for smaller bird while leaving wood pigeons to forage for themselves.

Dr Tim Harrison, of the BTO's Garden BirdWatch project, said: 'Wood pigeons cause ill-feeling amongst some garden bird enthusiasts - it is easy to see just a big stomach on legs.

'But there are things that you can do that mean you can still enjoy them coming into your garden, bringing a sense of the countryside with them.'
