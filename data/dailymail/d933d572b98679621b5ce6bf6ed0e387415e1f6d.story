Former Sheffield United striker Ched Evans, 25, will leave prison on Friday

Ched Evans will be released from jail as early as tomorrow with no electronic tag and nothing to stop him going back to a lucrative career in football.

The news came as his former club raised the prospect of the convicted rapist returning to play for them.

Sheffield United manager Nigel Clough said ‘one or two discussions’ had been held about re-signing the centre forward, who originally cost the club £3million.

Evans was on a reported salary of £20,000 a week before his conviction and remained in-contract for almost six weeks after he was jailed. Last night Sheffield United declined to say whether it had continued to pay his salary during that period.

Prison sources have indicated that Evans will walk free from Wymott prison in Lancashire tomorrow. He will remain on licence for the next two and a half years, meaning he must adhere to certain conditions, including holding regular meetings with his probation officer.

Evans will also be on the Sex Offender Register indefinitely and cannot change his address without telling the authorities. But prison service insiders revealed the footballer – who continues to protest his innocence – will not be subject to the same electronic monitoring as many other newly freed criminals.

That is because Evans has served exactly half his five-year sentence – the normal point for release. Electronic tagging is reserved for convicts released before the halfway point, under the so-called Home Detention Curfew regime. It removes the prospect of Evans returning to the football field wearing an ankle tag.

Sources said probation officials could still opt to place a curfew on Evans, but this would be highly unlikely to prevent him taking part in competitive football matches or training.

Restrictions on employment are applied only if the job would pose a danger to the public.

The most likely issue would be if he joined a team based abroad or that had fixtures overseas, as he might need permission to leave the country. It could also have an impact on his international career if he resumes playing for Wales.

If Evans did return to League One team Sheffield United, it would be against the wishes of more than 145,000 people who have signed a change.org petition against him returning. Fewer than 5,000 have signed a counter petition saying they wanted him back at the club.

Despite the furore, United manager Clough yesterday said a return remained possible – though he stopped short of endorsing such a move.

He told BBC Radio Sheffield: ‘We’ve had one or two discussions and the owners will make a decision on it. It is above a football level. If he comes back then we [the coaching staff] will decide whether to play him or not.’

Clough added: ‘It’s my decision whether to put him in the team if he comes back, it’s not my decision whether he comes back in the first place – that’s theirs.’

Upon his conviction, Evans was not sacked by the club.

He was jailed on April 20, 2012, and on May 30 of that year the club said it would not be renewing his contract.

Asked whether he was still paid during this time, a spokesman said last night: ‘We have no comment to make on that.’

Gordon Taylor, of the Professional Footballers’ Association, has argued that Evans should be allowed to return to the game, saying: ‘I didn’t know there was a law that said once you come out of prison you still can’t do anything.’

But Katie Russell, the director of communications for Rape Crisis England and Wales, has argued that barring Evans from the game would ‘send a strong message condemning sexual violence against women’.
