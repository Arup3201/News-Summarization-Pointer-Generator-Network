First came glamping, the middle class approach to spending a night under canvas without all the wind and rain.

But if that all seems a bit passé - and you’re not easily spooked – then you might want to try the next big holiday trend of church camping or ‘champing.’

Sleeping overnight inside a disused church is the latest initiative by The Churches Conservation Trust (CCT), the charity which looks after more than 300 redundant churches nationwide.

It hopes that trippers, keen for a quirky and educational holiday experience, will flock to stay in one of their historical Grade I or II listed buildings, and help generate cash for their upkeep in the process.

The charity are currently trialling group camping trips at All Saints Church, in Aldwincle, Northamptonshire.

Some might think that the medieval Domesday-listed church, with its Gothic windows, handsome limestone pillars and arches and creepy gargoyles, would not be conducive to a good night’s sleep.

But, although some visitors have admitted to feeling anxious, most have reported a very peaceful and satisfying stay, said Laoise Bailey, a spokesman for the CCT.

‘Some people have been a bit nervous because they thought it may be a bit creepy, but afterwards they’ve said they found it very calm and relaxing,’ she said.

‘The feedback we’ve had is they’ve enjoyed getting back to nature and the peace and quiet.’

Rugs are laid out on flagstones in the nave and visitors sleep on inflatable mattresses with blankets. Folding chairs, tables, a tea-making kit and portable lavatory and water basin, installed in the vestry, add to the comfort.

Guests are treated to a home-cooked meal at a local farmhouse bed and breakfast, before returning to the church where candles are lit at nightfall and a local historian arrives to regale them with magical stories about local myths and legends.

Bacon and egg baps are brought in by the same B&B for breakfast.

The scheme is being run in conjunction with the Wildlife Trust, who offer sessions on bat spotting in the surrounding graveyard, and Canoe2, a local adventure firm which organises self-guided paddle trips along the nearby River Nene as part of the deal.

Packages start from £99 per person, including the activities. The CCT say they are already in talks to set up a similar scheme at a church in Kent, and hope to bring on board other activities, such as hiking, cycling and star gazing, as well as rolling champing out to other venues across the country.

‘It is certainly one of the more innovative things we are doing and we are looking to make a profit,’ Miss Bailey said.

‘But any money we make all goes back into conserving the churches we look after.’

Village resident Bernard Lowe, who sits on the parish council, said local people in Aldwincle had been supportive of the ‘champing’ trips.

‘There’s not been any objections,’ he added.

‘The church was decommissioned 70 years ago and has been redundant a long while. It’s been used for the odd musical event, but there’s no pews or facilities, such as electricity or drainage, so it’s a big, quite spectacular cavernous floor space inside.

‘We’re right in the middle of the Nene valley and the River is less than half a mile away, so it’s perfect for the canoeing.’
