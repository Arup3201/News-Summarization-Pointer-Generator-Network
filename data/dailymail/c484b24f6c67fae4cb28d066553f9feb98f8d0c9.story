Ice cream giant Ben & Jerry's has sued a porn company, saying its X-rated 'Ben & Cherry's' DVDs have smeared its family-friendly reputation.    

The ice cream maker, which has previously introduced racily-named flavours including 'Schweddy Balls' and 'Karamel Sutra,' filed a trademark lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan.

The Vermont-based company claims the sale of 'Ben & Cherry's' hardcore and exploitative pornographic DVDs and related goods is tarnishing Ben & Jerry's Homemade Inc.'s name by creating an association with pornography.

It described the DVDs as 
'exploitative, hardcore pornographic films' featuring titles and themes 
based on 'well-known and iconic' Ben & Jerry's ice cream flavours. 
It also said the packaging imitates that of the ice-cream, which 
features a grazing cow, green grass and large white puffy clouds.

Ben & Jerry's said the films would be likely to cause 'confusion, mistake or deception' regarding the company's trademarks.

It identified some of the X-rated names 
similar to its own as, 'Boston Cream Thigh,' 'New York Fat & Chunky'
and 'Peanut Butter D-Cup'.

Ben & Jerry's has ice cream flavors titled 'Boston Cream Pie,' 'New York Super Fudge Chunk' and 'Peanut Butter Cup.'

For
nearly 35 years, Ben & Jerry's has produced and sold ice cream, 
frozen yogurt and sorbet, building its empire to over 300 U.S. stores 
and another 150 internationally. 

The lawsuit does not place a number on the damages being sought.
