Mauricio Pochettino is set to return to former club Espanyol for defender Hector Moreno.

The Tottenham manager wants to give his struggling side a facelift following a disappointing start to his reign.

And the Argentine has identified Moreno, 26, as a target in his attempts to strengthen his back four.

Hector Moreno represented Mexico at the World Cup. Here he is in action against Holland's Arjen Robben 

Moreno has 57 caps for Mexico and formerly worked with Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino at Espanyol 

The central defender, who has 57 caps for Mexico, worked under Pochettino at Espanyol during the manager's time with the Spanish club.

Pochettino originally signed Moreno from AZ Alkmaar in 2011. Manchester United have also been linked with a move for him.

Meanwhile, the Spurs boss is ready to use his under-performing stars as makeweights in plans to strengthen his squad in January.

He watched his side slump to an embarrassing defeat to Stoke on Sunday as the club's disappointing start to their Barclays Premier League season continued.

Pochettino is determined to strengthen his squad once the January transfer window reopens.

But as he found out in the summer, he will not be handed a vast transfer budget to sign the players he feels he needs to turn Spurs' season around.

Pochettino wants to sign two new strikers in the next window, Southampton's Jay Rodriguez being one of those.

He retains an interest in Rodriguez's team-mate Morgan Schneiderlin. Both players could cost Spurs in-excess of £40million.

Andros Townsend, in action during Tottenham's defeat against Stoke, could be sold by the club in January 

And Pochettino is prepared to use a number of his fringe and under-performing players to supplement his January transfer budget.

Among those who maybe deemed surplus to requirements by Pochettino include Paulinho, Andros Townsend, Aaron Lennon and Vlad Chiriches.

The quartet have made just four Premier League starts between them this season, and have not had the impact Pochettino would have hoped.

In his search for new talent, Pochettino has also been scouring the South American market for potential new signings.

River Plate striker Teo Gutierrez, who played for Colombia in the World Cup, has been watched by Spurs scouts.
