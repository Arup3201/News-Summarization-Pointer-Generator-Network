It's finally ironic! And this time we don't just think, we know.

Eighteen years after it was released Rachael and Eliza Hurwitz, two sisters from North Haven, Connecticut made a parody video of Alanis Morissette's 'Ironic,' that pokes fun at the original song which was famously ridiculed by scholars and fans alike for not actually being ironic.

In the song Morissette sings about several situations such as rain on your wedding day, finding a black fly in your drink, and being stuck in traffic when you're already late,  that though she labels ironic, are actually just a series of unlucky coincidences.

Alanis Morissette's (seen her in her musical video) 1998 music video for 'Ironic' was parodied on rhetorical grounds by two sisters

Sisters Eliza (seen here) and Rachael Hurwitz did a shot-for-shot spoof of Morissette's music video, making the unironic lyrics ironic

The 24-year old sisters rewrote the lyrics to the Grammy-nominated song for a version titled 'It's Finally Ironic,' and made a shot-for-shot remake of the music video that went viral on YouTube.

Now seen over half a million times, the Hurwitz's parody embellishes on Morissette's original lyrics to take the raw situations she presents and inject irony into them. 

Though Morissette's 'Ironic' was a popular song in the late 90's her lyrics were ridiculed for lacking actual irony

Rachael Hurwitz came up with the idea to parody the song after she remembered a teacher criticizing Morissette for using the rhetoric device incorrectly

In the song's chorus Morissette sings, 'It's like rain on your wedding day,' to which the sisters add, 'a day and place you chose because it known not to rain.'

Other memorable funny lyrics include, 'An old man turned 98, he won the lottery and died the next day,'  to which they added, 'from a severe paper cut from his lottery ticket.'

In her music video Morissette taking a wild road trip with three different sides of herself. She appears in different outfits and hairstyles throughout the video

The sisters, who imitate Morissette in the video spoof, wearing their hair in braids and performing eccentric antics, sing, 'We've got an editorial way of sneaking up on when you think your irony is ok and the examples in your song are right .'

'We've got an editorial way of helping you out when your song about irony is wrong and everyone says it to your face,' at the song's bridge.

Morissette has taken a lot of criticism for her lyrics to 'Ironic' over the years. Critics say she uses the device incorrectly, listing scenarios that are unfortunate but not ironic

The Hurwitz sister's video went viral on YouTube getting over half a million views

Eliza even repeatedly intones in a sweet whisper, 'And that really is ironic. We fixed it for you Alanis, you're welcome.'

Eliza and Rachael told The Wall Street Journal that the inspiration for the song came after they remembered
hearing an English teacher correcting the literary device improperly deployed in the lyrics.

Alanis Morissette claimed that the irony in her video lies in the lack thereof in her lyrics, however critics and fans have never quite bought that explanation

The sister's filmed the video in Connecticut, reenacting the most iconic bits for the parody

Eliza, a stand-up 
comedian, rewrote the lyrics and collaborated with Rachael, who is 
pursuing a career in music to make the video, the paper reported.

'We felt like [a video] would pack the
most punch,' Eliza said. 'We were hoping we'd get a couple hundred 
views, but then ['Star Trek' actor] George Takei tweeted about it and it
just blew up.'

There's been no word yet  from Morissette on whether or not she finds the video funny, though hopefully this time she'll be able to find irony in the situation. Don't you think?
