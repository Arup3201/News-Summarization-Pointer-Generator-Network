Driving experts are warning women to abandon their fashionable Ugg boots and Hunter wellies when behind the wheel.

Road safety organisation GEM Motoring Assist said many drivers - particularly women - were worried about keeping their feet warm during the current cold spell.

However, GEM is urging drivers to keep a sensible pair of shoes for driving in the car.

The group said swapping Ugg-style sheepskin boots and wellingtons for appropriate shoes while driving could make a real difference when it comes to road safety.

David Williams, head of GEM Motoring Assist, said: 'We know that fashion dictates which winter boots are popular this season, however, many of them don't offer enough grip and could cause your foot to slip off or in between the peddles when driving.

'This could cause a serious accident if control of your car is lost.

'Always keep a sturdy pair of shoes in your vehicle for driving, ideally ones that can be fastened securely or laced up, and with a good grip on the sole. Correct footwear makes driving a lot less hazardous.'

Wellington boots can also make it more difficult to control your feet and movement on the pedals, says GEM.

Dangerous driving: Assistant headteacher Vera Baxter caused a head-on car crash after her Ugg boot became trapped under her brake pedal

The heavy duty rubber and thick shape of wellingtons allow less room for manoeuvre, making them one of the least practical options for driving this winter.

Mr Williams said: 'Not only should drivers be comfortable when driving, they should also make sure their movement is not restricted or impaired.

'If your boots or shoes don't let you move freely, switch to a pair that allows you complete control over your driving, and your vehicle, at all times.'

Last October a teacher wearing Ugg boots caused a head-on collision when one of her shoes became trapped under a brake pedal.

Assistant headteacher Vera Baxter, 49, was unable to slow her VW Golf down because her footwear had become snagged on the pedal and she took evasive action to avoid hitting cars in front.

However, she veered into the path of a Mercedes being driven by Jason Hoang, 33, in Manchester city centre.

She had also caused a police patrol car to swerve out of her way just moments before hitting the car of Mr Hoang from Middlewich, Cheshire.

Baxter was arrested and charged with dangerous driving after being treated for cracked ribs and internal bruising. Mr Hoang suffered from whiplash.

After the crash, Baxter tore her boot away from the pedal and crawled free from the wreckage.

She was banned from driving for four months and fined Â£350.

She said: 'My Ugg boot got trapped at the traffic lights.

'I suppose it was a freak accident - as I put my boot across the prong of the pedal it caught in the seams.
