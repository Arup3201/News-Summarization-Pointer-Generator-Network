Two college friends of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev
have been indicted by a federal grand jury on obstruction of justice charges in connection with the Boston 
Marathon bombing investigation, authorities announced Thursday.

Dias
Kadyrbayev, 19, and Azamat Tazhayakov, 19, both Kazakhstan nationals, 
have been charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice and 
obstructing justice with the intent to impede investigation.

The indictment alleges that 
three days after the bombings, ‘Kadyrbayev received a text message from 
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev suggesting that he go to Tsarnaev's “room and take 
what's there.'"

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and
his brother Tamerlan, originally from Chechnya, allegedly carried out 
the bombing at the Boston marathon's finish line on April 15 which 
killed three people and injured more than 260.

Tazhayakov
and Kadyrbayev are accused of removing a backpack containing fireworks 
emptied of gunpowder and a laptop from Tsarnaev's dorm room three days 
after the attack to try to keep him from getting into trouble.

If
convicted they face up to 20 years in prison on 
the obstruction of justice count, a $250,00 fine and the probability of being 
deported.  

Prosecutors
said Kadyrbayev texted Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on April 18 telling him he looked like
one of the bombing suspects the FBI was hunting.

Police initially investigated Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov after the discovery of their license plates (pictured)

Connection: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is seen here with Dias Kadyrbayev, and the two reportedly joked about him being the Boston Marathon bomber via text in the days after the attack

Tsarnaev reportedly texted back 'lol' and 'you better not text me'.

That
same night, Kadyrbayev, Tazhayakov and Robel Phillipos - charged in the case
but not included in today's indictment - went to Tsarnaev’s UMass Dartmouth
dorm room, where Tazhayakov received a text from Tsarnaev that read, 'I’m about
to leave if you need something in my room take it.'

Tazhayakov
told investigators at that point, he thought 'he would never see Tsarnaev alive
again.'

Once inside the dorm, Kadyrbayev found Dzhokhar’s backpack filled with
seven 6- to 8-inch-long 'red tubular fireworks' with the powder emptied out.

Kadyrbayev told investigators that when he saw them, he knew that 'Tsarnaev was
involved in the marathon bombing.'

The friends also found a jar of Vaseline
that Tazhayakov believed Dzhokhar had 'used to make bombs.'

They then left the
dorm, taking the items and the suspected bomber’s laptop, prosecutors have
said.

Tsarnaev, who is currently being held without bail in a federal prison in Massachusetts, has pleaded not guilty to 30 counts - including the four killings - associated with the bombing

Back
at their New Bedford apartment, prosecutors say the three collectively decided
to throw away the backpack because they 'didn’t want to get Dzhokhar into
trouble,' according to Kadyrbayev.

He admitted to throwing it into a dumpster,
but the three differ on when, with one saying it was around 10 p.m., another saying
it was sometime between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m., and a third saying it was after 6
a.m. the next morning.

Federal officials swarmed Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov’s
New Bedford apartment, taking them and a woman into custody. They are to be arraigned at 2 p.m. Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Boston.

Kadyrbayev’s attorney, Robert G. Stahl, has said his client is disappointed that he has been indicted, especially since he cooperated with the FBI and was so forthcoming about what he knew that the FBI was able to recover the items they were searching for.

'Even though he was literally stunned and in fear [when Tsarnaev was identified as a bomber], and even though he is from a country where the police are routinely distrusted, from the moment the authorities approached him he has cooperated fully,' said Stahl.

Arraigned: Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev pleaded not guilty to over 30 charges stemming from the April 15 attack and subsequent escape attempt

He
added, 'despite the rush to judgment and, now, the present charges, 
Dias trusts the American justice system and looks forward to proving his
innocence at trial.'

The
lawyer also said that his client and his client’s family was shocked 
and saddened by the terror bombing and the loss of life it caused.

Supporters
have described what Tsarnaev’s friends allegedly did as the innocent 
act of devoted friends. The two men are not charged with conspiring with
Tsarnaev.

Tsarnaev,
who is currently being held without bail in a federal prison in 
Massachusetts, has pleaded not guilty to 30 counts - including the four 
killings - associated with the bombing.

Last month his lawyer 
filed a motion in court requesting Virginia attorney David Bruck,
said to be a death penalty expert, be added to the alleged terrorist’s 
publicly subsidized defense team.

Bruck
was able to negotiate life sentences for several notable terrorists 
including one of the hijackers of Pan Am flight 82 in 1986 and one of 
the four men convicted for bombing the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi in 1998, 
according to reports.
