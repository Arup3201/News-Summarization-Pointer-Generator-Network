The parents of two young children allegedly killed by their nanny in 
the family's Manhattan home spoke today of the comfort that their surviving four-year-old daughter brings them in a series of emotional 
posts on Facebook.

Kevin and Marina Krim's two-year-old son Leo and his six-year-old 
sister Lucia were murdered at the family's Upper West Side home in 
October in an horrific crime that shocked America.

Mrs Krim arrived home at the family apartment to find two of her two children dead in the bath-tub next to nanny Yoselyn Ortega who had slit her own throat in an alleged suicide attempt.

The devastated pair have been trying 
to rebuild their lives staying with family in California, but are 
currently driving cross-country back to New York, chronicling their trip
and their attempts to cope with their loss on a Facebook page set up to
raise charity funds in their children's memory.

And in a post marking surviving 
daughter Nessie's fourth birthday, Mr Krim, an executive at America's 
CNBC television station, said that they are drawing strength from their 
remaining child.

He said: 'Marina and I couldn't be 
more proud of her -- she is very smart, beautiful and tough. And she's 
grown so much over the past two months. She saves us every day.'

The couple took to the Facebook page,
called the Lulu & Leo Fund, set up to raise money for childrens' 
education and enrichment programmes, last week to announce their journey
back to New York.

They said: 'We are hopeful that 2013 will be a year of healing, growth and peace.

Tragic: The couple have posted pictures of Leo and Lulu's artwork on the Facebook page set up to raise charity money in their memory

Christmas visit: The family posted a picture from a visit to a Leo Poluti mural at Los Angeles' Union Station on Christmas Eve

Memories: Kevin and Marina Krim have been posting pictures of their children Leo and Lucia on Facebook following the pair's murder in October

'Along the way, we are hoping to 
experience some inspiring moments that will help us with our healing and
rebuilding when we get back to NYC.'

So far the family have posted from 
Santa Fe, in New Mexico, where they visited a series of art galleries 
and posted pictures of some contemporary art that they say Leo and 
Lucia, known as Lulu, would have liked.

The family also shared pictures of a 
mural by Leo Poluti, Lulu's favourite children's author, at Los Angeles 
Union Station, which they visited just before Christmas in honour of 
Leo's 'love for tunnel choo choos'.

Mr and Mrs Krim posted pictures of contemporary art from various galleries in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The pair posted the pictures they thought that Lucia and Leo would have liked best

The pair have used the fundraising 
site and a memorial page set up in Lulu and Leo's honour to share their 
grief in the months since their children's deaths, posting pictures of 
the pair and some of their artwork.

Marina and Kevin Krim even used the 
page to offer their own condolences to the parents of children killed in
the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre last month.

The page has been inundated with 
thousands of messages of support from other parents and well wishers 
offering support and condolences.

Mother Marina had kept an online blog when Leo and Lulu were alive, charting their childhood called 'Life with the Krim Kids'.

Yoselyn Ortega has pleaded not guilty to the children's murder and is currently being held at a prison hospital.
