Myspace has staged a comeback, adding one million new users since December.

The site has gone from adding zero new users per day to adding 40,000 per day, according to new owners Specific Media.

The site says that a new music player offering 42 million songs has helped its 'revival', along with a closer tie-up with successful social networks such as Facebook.

User numbers now stand at 25.1 million - compared to at least 800 million for newcomer Facebook.

Until early 2008, MySpace was the most-visited social network in the world, with at least 100 million users worldwide.

Specific Media acquired MySpace from former owner Newscorp in June 2011.Newscorp acquired Myspace at the height of its fame for $580 million, and sold it for $35 million.

Myspace unveiled a new music player which offers free access to 42 million songs in December.

Streaming rivals such as Spotify offer a much smaller library - Spotify subscribers only have access to 15 million songs.

Myspace now offers an 'app' which works within Facebook - and Facebook users can log in with their existing Facebook details.

On January 14th, the app was used by 900,000 monthly active users - one month later, that had risen to 1.4 million users.

The rise of Facebook saw the music-themed site lose popularity rapidly - in one Month, March 2011, the site lost 10 million users.

Many people preferred the 'clean' layout of Facebook to the busy look of Myspace, which let users customise the view of every page.

The new owners aim to focus on Myspace's proven track record in music, and have announced a tie-up with Panasonic to deliver Myspace content to Panasonic flatscreens.
