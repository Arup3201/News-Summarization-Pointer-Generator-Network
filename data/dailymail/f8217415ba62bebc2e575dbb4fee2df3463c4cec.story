Any Manchester United move to resign Gerard Pique is likely to be scuppered by pop star Shakira.

The Barcelona defender's partner does not want to leave the Catalan city for Manchester. And any move would represent a huge upheaval for the showbiz couple's family.

Pique is unhappy on the Nou Camp sidelines after a spell out of the team thanks to new signing Jeremy Mathieu.

Reports in Spain indicate Pique could be set for a return to Old Trafford, while Louis van Gaal's need for defenders is well documented after an appalling start to the season.

But Pique was heartened by Barca boss Luis Enrique's praise this week.

The former Nou Camp midfielder said: 'Pique's attitude is great, he's optimistic, working hard. His hip problem has been solved, he's ready to help us.'

But Pique has not been in contact with United, where he left for Barcelona in 2008.

Pique has known Old Trafford boss Van Gaal since he was 13, with the Dutchman knowing the defender's grandfather.
