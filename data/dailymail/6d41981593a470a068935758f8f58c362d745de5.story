It may be bleak, cold and raining in New York.

But that was hardly enough to stop more than 150,000 people donning elaborate - often skimpy - costumes for the third day of Comic Con.

Today's event saw guest appearances of William Shatner and Hulk Hogan among the screenings, panels and book signings at the Jacob Javits Center.

The A-listers were hardly the center of attention, however, among the hobbits, Han Solos, supermen, and half-naked cows.

From midday, streams of men, women and children - some still in pushchairs - began streaming into the exhibition room dressed as characters from movies, books, and video games. 

There was even a faction of people protesting against Ben Affleck being cast as Batman in a 2016 comic movie: Batman v Superman.

As ever, numerous women came scantily clad like their favorite characters - some wore little more than panties and tape. 

It is a controversial issue that has plagued the event for years as many cosplayers complain they are fondled and intrusive photos are taken of them and later posted on the internet. 

Excitement: More than 150,000 fans flocked from all over the world to enjoy the events and activities at New York's ninth Comic Con

Gamers: While many dressed up as movie and comic characters, others came as video game figures, such as these two from MarioKart

Expanded: The event started with just 20,000 ticket-holders and 25,000 square feet of exhibits. This year’s New York Comic Con sold 150,000 tickets, covers 200,000 square feet and boasts 2,000 speakers and presenters with people paying thousands for tickets

In a bid to tackle the controversy, organizers this year hung posters warning people that 'cosplay does not mean consent', that they should keep their hands to themselves, and ask for permission before taking photos. 

Nine years after the event started, it has become a major boost for the local and national economy. 

It started with just 20,000 ticket-holders and 25,000 square feet of exhibits. This year’s New York Comic Con sold 150,000 tickets, covers 200,000 square feet and boasts 2,000 speakers and presenters.

Popular: Last year, New York Comic Con generated more than $70 million and tickets sold out within minutes for the event

Last year, New York Comic Con generated more than $70 million, according to the New York Times, and tickets sold out within minutes for the event. 

It has even spurned a secondary ticket market, with people selling their entry passes online for triple the price. 

According to Alex Fensterman, the creator, New York Comic Con is 'a reflection of New York City' and, compared to the unaffiliated San Diego version, 'a little bit less Hollywood focused, a little bit more comic book, publishing, television focused.'

The convention continues over the weekend, with hyped events such as Bill Nye signing autographs for fans and a panel featuring creators and actors from AMC's Walking Dead.

Fans can also shop for collectibles. 

Digg compiled the most valuable items for sale, including the highest-valued comic, the first Action Comics issue held by Bryan Menegus, valued over $3million.
