Rowan Williams, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, has criticised 'short-term' celebrity style weddings

The former Archbishop of Canterbury has attacked glamorous weddings as being part of the 'short-term, unimaginative, emotionally unintelligent' culture of modern Britain.

Rowan Williams, who married the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, said marriage was now being marketed to people as a day long experience, rather than a lifetime commitment.

Speaking at a debate hosted by law firm Winckworth Sherwood in London, Lord Williams also criticised pre-nuptual agreements for undermining the trust at the heart of marriage.

According to The Telegraph, he said: 'We need to take a long hard look at the marketisation of marriage.

'That is the perfect relationship crystalised in the perfect wedding day - the immense economic, advertising investment in this massively fantastical experience which you go through on your wedding day, after which, of course, nothing is ever quite so good again.

'That is an aspect I think of the short-term, unimaginative, emotionally unintelligent climate that sometimes we seem forced to inhabit.'

Lord Williams, who stepped down as Archbishop last year and became master of Magdalene college at the University of Cambridge, said that the modern urge for short-term gratification was also to blame.

He urged people to focus on their long-term growth as a person, rather than being distracted with temporary enjoyment in fast-paced society.

He added: 'Marriage has faced many changes and pressures, such as evolving working patterns and a reluctance for many people to think about their long-term well-being.

'Yet much remains unchanged; the majority
 of children are, for example, still born to married couples and there 
remains a strong desire for the public affirmation of commitment.'

Katie Price has famously had several short-lived marriages including to Alex Reid (pictured) which lasted less than a year. She also famously rode to one of the ceremonies in a Cinderella-style pumpkin carriage

He also criticised pre-nups as creating a relationship 'governed by contract' in which both partners were only thinking of what they could get out of it.

His warning echoes that of Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, who said in December that a fixation with 'glitzy, celebrity' weddings fuelled by glossy magazines is overshadowing the true meaning of marriage.

At the time he warned that the obsession with expensive nuptials was discouraging many youngsters from tying the knot and starting families and saddling those that do with debts from the ceremony that add strain to their relationships.
