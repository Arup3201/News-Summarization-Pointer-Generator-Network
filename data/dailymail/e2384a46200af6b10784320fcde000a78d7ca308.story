Nathaniel Chalobah has returned to Chelsea at the end of his loan deal at Burnley.

The 20-year-old midfielder did not make the impact he would have wanted with the Clarets, with his contribution limited to one Premier League start and four substitute appearances.

Boss Sean Dyche said: 'Nathaniel will go back to Chelsea and we thank him for his efforts in his time with us.

Chalobah headed to Burnley looking to impress Jose Mourinho but has had limited game time

'We hope he has developed here, albeit not on the pitch as much as he would have liked. He has, however, been an active part of the group and has been a credit to himself.

'We wish him well as he looks to further progress his career.'

The England Under 21 international arrived at Turf Moor on transfer deadline day hoping to impress Blues boss Jose Mourinho and show he could break the mould by being a Chelsea academy product worthy of regular first-team consideration.

But while Ruben Loftus-Cheek has been tipped for a bright future by Mourinho, Chalobah, who once made the Chelsea bench aged 15, is struggling to build on the early hype which surrounded him. 

Chalobah has 21 caps for the England Under 21 side, and has also played for the Under 16, 17 and 19 sides

Dyche had admitted the Barclays Premier League's unforgiving nature has limited the teenager's opportunities.

'He's a young player learning, earning his spurs and developing, and this is a tough league to do all those things in and do them every week,' said the Clarets manager.

'Behind the scenes he's working hard and should he get his chance, he'll be ready to take it.'
