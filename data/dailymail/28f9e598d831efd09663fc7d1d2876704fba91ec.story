Comedian John Cleese has blamed his troubled relationship with his late mother for his years of therapy and four marriages.

The Monty Python star, who married his fourth wife Jennifer Wade in 2012, said his mother Muriel had 'utterly egotistical impulses' and that he lacked any affection for her during his childhood.

Cleese, 74, also revealed in his new autobiography, So, Anyway, that he lost his virginity aged 25.

Monty Python actor John Cleese says his fraught relationship with his mother 'dominated' his romantic liaisons

Cleese co-wrote Fawlty Towers with his first wife, Connie Booth, who he married in 1968. 

They had one child together, but had divorced by the time the second series aired.

Cleese's second marriage, to Barbara Trentham, lasted nine years, with the couple remaining friends after their split in 1990.

He then wed Alyce Eichelberger, a marriage he reportedly told close friend Michael Winner he regretted, but  nonetheless they stayed together for 16 years.

Finally the Monty Python actor married Jennifer Wade, who is 31 years younger than him, in 2012. 

He told the Sunday Times magazine that his mother, who died at the age of 101 in 2000, 'dominated' his relationships, and that he had sought therapy because of his issues with women.

'It is said you shouldn't speak ill of the dead but it seems to me an ideal opportunity,' he said.

'I don't want to get too dark and depressing but she was emotionally difficult. She was a tyrant.'

In an extract of his new autobiography, So, Anyway, published in the magazine, he wrote: 'It cannot be a coincidence that I spent such a large part of my life in some form of therapy and that the vast majority of the problems I was dealing with involved relationships with women.

'My ingrained habit of walking on eggshells when dealing with my mother dominated my romantic liaisons for many years.'

Cleese's divorces took their toll on the comedian's finances too, with £12.5m reportedly paid out to Ms Eichelberger after their split.

In 2011, Cleese embarked on his 'Alimony Tour', which he said would help pay the large settlement, which included £600,000 a year for seven years for his third wife. 

He is set to perform a number of theatre shows later this year following publication of his memoir on October 9.

In the book, the Fawlty Towers actor also revealed he was almost 25 when he lost his virginity while touring New Zealand with the Cambridge Circus because 'girls just weren't around'.

Meanwhile, despite the success of a string of sell-out comeback shows at London's 02 Arena in July, Cleese admitted he felt 'no trace of excitement' by the second show of their 10-night run.

'It was only our second night,' he said.

'I was waiting to start a sketch and a few seconds before the spotlight turned on me, I could see the huge packed arena and I felt no trace of excitement.

'If you're standing in front of 6,000 people and you're thinking "this is perfectly pleasant but I'm not in the slightest bit excited", then God, or possibly Richard Dawkins, is sending you a message that maybe you should be doing something else.'
