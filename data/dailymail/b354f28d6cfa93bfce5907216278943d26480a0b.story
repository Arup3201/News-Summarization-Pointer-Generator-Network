It's something we do every day but it seems we don’t get any better at it.

It takes us more than half an hour to feel awake in the morning, according to a survey.

Fewer than one in five Britons (17 per cent) consider themselves to be morning people.

Daydream nation: A study found that it takes 36 minutes for Brits to feel awake

The study found that after being disturbed by the alarm clock, we typically snooze for 14 minutes and don’t feel awake for 36 minutes.

Two out of three said they are less likely to snooze when woken by an alarm with ‘natural’ sounds.

Some 73 per cent of those questioned by Radox thought the sound of a bird tweeting or a cock crowing made them wake up in a more positive mood. 

And, on average, we lose at least an hour’s sleep per night in December due to worries over Christmas. 

Two thirds (66 per cent) of Brits feel 
unmotivated in the morning and 60 per cent admitted to sleeping in more 
during the dark winter months. 

Just under a quarter (23 per cent) 
admitted to suffering from ‘seasonal sleeping slips’ as they recorded 
more late attendance during December.

A further 15 per cent said they were 
prone to sick days during the final month of the year

Dev Banerjee of The Sleep Clinic said: ‘The first sound we hear in the morning has such an effect on our mood for the rest of the day.

'That’s why we often feel down when woken up to ringing phones, pinging emails or the same monotonous alarm clock'

The top ‘wake up happy’ sounds were: 1, birds tweeting. 2, cockerel crowing. 3, waves crashing. 4, wind chimes. 5, piano playing. 6, orchestral symphony. 7, church bells
