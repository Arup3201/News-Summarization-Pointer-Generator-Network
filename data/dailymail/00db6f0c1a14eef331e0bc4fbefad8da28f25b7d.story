The super-rich's dogs are often seen as a fashionable accessory to go along with shoes and handbags, but some pets are enjoying with an extravagant existence of their own that is unthinkable to the average person.

The Rich Dogs of Instagram, a new photo account that draws inspiration from the opulence on the Rich Kids of Instagram, shows how having a dog's life isn't always a bad thing.

It displays the wealthy's pampered pooches sunbathing in crystal clear pools, rolling around in wads of cash and flying on private jets.

The dogs probably cannot revel in the jealousy of others the way their  masters can, though the canines do seem to be making the most of the high life.

Barking up the right tree: While the dogs are probably oblivious to the extravagance that surrounds them, some do a good job playing the part

Luxurious lapdogs: Kaylin Pound of Elite Daily brought together pictures of the world's luckiest dogs after seeing an account making fun of the Rich Kids of Instagram

The collection of canines with more money than Croesus was aggregated together by Elite Daily's Kaylin Pound starting Thursday after she saw a site mocking the original Rich Kids of Instagram.

While the Rich Kids may coast through life using money from their parents, their pets don't even have to worry about paying for anything.

Using the hashtag #rdoi, the account has posted 50 pictures with assorted wealthy dog jokes.

Rich Instagram users' pooches are seen getting ready to do the 'doggy paddle' in indoor mansion pools.

Another dog sat in a mini Audi Spyder says the new car is 'bad to the bone'.  

Better than a leash: While the lapdogs are sometimes considered an accessory, they get to wear designer clothing themselves

Give paws: The dogs of the super-rich enjoy luxuries that most humans will never get the chance to experience 

A picture of a pooch surrounded by the conquests of a luxury shopping trip is captioned 'throw it in the doggy bag'. 

The trust fund puppies probably do not know how good they have it, enjoying luxury vacations and in exotic locations beyond most hardworking humans' wildest dreams.

However, several do a good job of looking smug for the camera, no doubt confident in the fact that they are the 'one percent' of the millions of dogs on the Internet.

Doggies show off their style as their owners dress them up in extravagant designer clothes or add to the animals' natural fur with an expensive, fluffy coat.

The array of poodles, pugs and chihuahuas also seems particularly fond of high-class champagne, with bottles of brands such as Dom Perignon being poured into their mouths. 

Unfortunately, while their owners may pride themselves on distinguishing between the finest bubblies, alcohol can be severely toxic to dogs and make them sick.

Two years ago there was also a Rich Cats of Instagram page, though the Tumblr page has stopped updating.

Ready to catch the mailman: The wealthy like to give their dogs replicas of the expensive cars they purchase

Every dog has its day: While most people only dream of living in opulence, the Rich Dogs of Instagram enjoy it free of charge
