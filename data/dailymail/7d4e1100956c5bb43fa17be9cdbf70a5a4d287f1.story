A walrus has turned up on one of the Orkney islands, more than 2,000 miles from his home.

The animal, thought to be a young male, was spotted on the shoreline of North Ronaldsay in Scotland.

Eyewitnesses said it appeared to be in good health and happy to be the centre of attention.

This walrus was seen basking on the shore at Bridesness on the south east coast of North Ronaldsay today.

A walrus was spotted on one of the Orkney islands in Scotland, more than 2,200 miles away from home

He was spotted around 10am by a 
birdwatcher.

Experts think he is a boy due to the pinkish nodules
on his neck and shoulders.

It
was first seen by Mark Warren, the assistant warden of the North 
Ronaldsay Bird Observatory and Guest House - who is more used to logging
birds.

The 32-year-old could not believe his eyes.

'My husband rang me and said `guess what I`ve just seen? A walrus!`," said his wife Fleur, 28.

'I thought he was joking at first.

'It is just amazing that he has turned up here. He seems happy enough and gives out a grunt. We would not like to get too close. Even though he`s young he is still a big animal.

'He does not appear to have sustained any injury and could just be not used to encountering humans. But it is simply unbelievable.'

Walrus populations are concentrated around the North Pole and Arctic Ocean areas - Siberia, Canada, Greenland and Alaska - living in shallow waters above the continental shelves.

The large flippered marine mammals, characterised by their long tusks, spend significant amounts of their lives on the sea ice.

Their population dropped rapidly as they were widely killed by humans for their blubber, walrus ivory and meat during the 19th and 20th centuries.

However, their population rebounded after hunting them became largely outlawed.

Walruses are famous for their tusks and are the only pinnipeds - true seals, sea lions and fur seals - that have them.

The tusks can grow up to 1m in length, and males tend to have larger tusks than females. The tusks are used for keeping breathing holes in the ice open, for fighting and for helping the walruses haul themselves out of the water on to an ice floe.

Adult males in the Pacific can weigh more than 1,700 kg (3,700 lb) and, among pinnipeds, are exceeded in size only by the two species of elephant seals.

Walruses live mostly in shallow waters above the continental shelves, spending significant amounts of their lives on the sea ice looking for benthic bivalve mollusks to eat.

Walruses are relatively long-lived, social animals, and they are considered to be a "keystone species" in the Arctic marine regions.
