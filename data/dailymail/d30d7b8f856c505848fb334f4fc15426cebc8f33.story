Having plied his trade among Europe's elite for over a decade it's fair to say Xabi Alonso knows a player. 

Winning the Champions League twice, the former Liverpool midfielder can identify exactly what it takes to formulate a team to lift the continent's biggest prize.

Now at Bayern Munich, the Spaniard has picked his greatest ever Champions League XI - starting with Manuel Neuer and ending with Lionel Messi. 

Here is Alonso's team and why he picked them in his own words. And he's played with or against them all.

Manuel Neuer

Teams played for: Schalke, Bayern Munich 

Wins: 2013 

I have played with some fantastic goalkeepers, but he is the best. It isn’t just the ability he has to make saves, but how good he is outfield and the fantastic composure that he always shows on the ball.

Philipp Lahm

Team played for: Bayern Munich

Wins: 2013 

Such a great player for Bayern, his leadership and qualities have been missed while he has been injured. Hopefully we will have him back for some important matches before the end of the season. He is comfortably one of the top five defenders of the last 10 years.

Sergio Ramos

Teams played for: Real Madrid

Wins: 2014 

When Sergio is mentally on the top of his game, then I think he is the best there is. He is a leader, he gives everything, and as a player in midfield he is the sort of defender that makes you feel very comfortable being behind you.

Carles Puyol

Teams played for: Barcelona

Wins: 2006, 2009, 2011 

So important for Spain’s success at the Euros in 2008 and then was even better when we won the World Cup in 2010. So dependable at the back, and then scored that winning goal against Germany in the semi-final.

David Alaba

Teams played for: Bayern Munich

Wins: 2013

One of those players who I think does not get the recognition outside of Germany and Austria he deserves. Maybe the most complete full back in the world who can attack and defend brilliantly. When I joined Bayern it was him and Neuer who impressed me the most.

Zinedine Zidane

Teams played for: Juventus, Real Madrid

Wins: 2002 

I played against him when he was at Madrid and also against France, then of course he was part of the staff when I was playing for Real. At his peak he was on a different level to anybody, made the most difficult of things look easy.

Paul Scholes

Teams played for: Manchester United

Wins: 1999, 2008 

In Spain you would not believe how well respected he is by professionals and journalists. Maybe because he was quiet off the field he never got the right praise in England because he likes to keep a low profile. Technically he could have played in any league in the world.

Xavi

Teams played for: Barcelona

Wins: 2006, 2009, 2011 

Such an intelligent player, and proof that you don’t have to cover 100 miles to be effective. So much of Spain’s success was because we played with so many midfield players, and Xavi was at the centre of everything.

Barcelona captain Xavi has been the heartbeat of the Catalans' side for years

Steven Gerrard

Teams played for: Liverpool

Wins: 2005 

He is a great friend and has been a big influence on my life. As a player it is about so much more than his obvious ability. It’s his behaviour, his leadership, the values that he stands for and what he represents as a captain.

Cristiano Ronaldo

Teams played for: Manchester United, Real Madrid

Wins: 2008, 2014 

If you looked at his goalscoring record for Real Madrid and you hadn’t witnessed it yourself, then you just wouldn’t believe that it is possible. I have been privileged to play with some amazing players, but he is the best.

Lionel Messi

Teams played for: Barcelona

Wins: 2006, 2009, 2011 

To have two players like Messi and Ronaldo in the same era is pretty rare. The individual brilliance that they are capable of sets them apart. It is no surprise that they have won so many Ballon d'Ors between them.

Lionel Messi's goalscoring record since breaking through at Barcelona has been phenomenal
