Foreign fraudsters are trawling through public registers to target households  in a sophisticated new identity theft scam.

The criminals use personal details from records such as Companies House to apply for credit and store cards.

They order expensive equipment online from abroad and an accomplice then waits near the unsuspecting victim’s home to intercept the courier and sign for the goods.

Step one: Fraudsters use personal details from records such as Companies House to apply for credit and store cards and order equipment online

If the parcel has already been delivered, a bogus courier will call at the house and ask for the item’s return, claiming it was sent in error.

One victim, Mike Finlason, 70, from Fareham, Hampshire, received an iPhone and watch from Argos last week that he had not ordered.

When he contacted the company, he was told he had applied for an Argos credit card on February 18 and bought the goods at the same time.

The order had been placed from an AOL email address in  St Petersburg, Russia.

Step two: The criminals wait near the unsuspecting victim¿s home to intercept the courier and sign for the goods.

The applicant had given  Mr Finlason’s name, address and date of birth, and described his job as director of My Music Ltd – a now-defunct company he had set up in the 1990s.

Mr Finlason said: ‘I was told that fraudsters in Russia have been going through the Companies House website for personal information like this. Argos told me it’s going on all over the country.’

The Home Retail Group,  which owns Argos, said: ‘We are continually working to combat new fraud tactics and have stringent processes in place  to protect our customers.’

A spokesman for Action Fraud – the UK’s internet crime reporting centre – confirmed that police forces around the country were investigating incidents of ‘courier scam’.

Companies House said it was unaware its website was being plundered in this way.
