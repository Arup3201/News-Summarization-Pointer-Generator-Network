The lawyer for Liam Gallagher's American baby mother has warned him it would be 'foolish' to continue refusing to fly to New York to give a deposition.

Ira Garr said that the Wonderwall singer will get fined again by a judge as he blamed his 'lack of focus' for the failure to make a deal.Garr said that Gallagher's divorce in Britain to All Saints singer Nicole Appleton had been 'far more taxing' than his child custody battle in New York, which was not apparently a priority.

Mr Garr spoke out after a stormy week in Gallagher's bitter maintenance battle with US journalist Liza Ghorbani over their daughter Gemma, 21 months.

Ghorbani's father Danny spoke for the first time to condemn Gallagher for 'dodging' US justice by failing to attend the last hearing because he was apparently ill.

Fatherless: Liza Ghorbani's daughter Gemma has never met her father in the 21 months since she was born. Her mother is involved in a bitter legal case over how much maintenance Liam Gallaghter should pay

Criticised: Former Oasis singer Liam Gallagher was described as 'foolish' by the lawyer for Ghorbani if he failed to turn up again to a New York court to give evidence over the maintenance dispute 

However that weekend he was seen walking hand in hand in London with his new girlfriend, Debbie Gwyther.

A judge fined Mr Gallagher $5,000 and he will likely be reprimanded again if he fails to show up at his deposition next month said Mr Garr, whose previous clients include Rupert Murdoch.Garr said: 'I assume he will come over. 

'The judge will sanction him again if he doesn't come. To not come over would be foolish.'

Garr said that he believed a deal was not far off and hoped it would emerge in the coming months.

All that remains are 'nitpicking issues' like how the ensure Gallagher pays and what to do if he stops paying.

The main problem however 'seems to be the accountants'.

Referring to Gallagher's divorce lawyer, Garr said: 'I think the cause is that everything is going through the accountants and Fiona Shackleton's office'

Trying to explain why there was no deal with Gallagher, he said: 'It might be for want of a lack of a better word, a lack of focus.

'If you have lengthy financial matters in if there's a child support case it's far more taxing than the child support issue which is basically coming to a number and how it's going to be paid.'

Gallagher, 42, had Gemma with Ghorbani, 40, in 2013 after she profiled him for the New York Times.

Since then the two have been slogging it out in the courts about child support.

Backing: Liza Ghorbani's father Danny said that Liam Gallagher had repeatedly 'failed to do the right thing' by his granddaughter as he spoke out in her support

Ghorbani had filed a $3 million lawsuit against Mr Gallagher at the Manhattan Family Court but after the case was dismissed she refiled in the Manhattan Supreme Court.

Gallagher is currently paying her $5,000 a month until a final decision about child maintenance can be agreed.

arr said that unless a deal is reached then the monthly payment could be reviewed every three years, and Mr Gallagher could end up being the loser.

New York child custody laws state that Gallagher could be forced to pay more if his income goes up by 15 per cent in that time, not to mention the inconvenience of regular renegotiation.

Garr said: 'Liam's band [Oasis] has disbanded. Let's say he and his brother work it out and get back together.

'If they did do they would make a zillion dollars. When [bands] don't perform in years and they go back on tour they make a fortune.

'Why would someone subject themselves to coming back [to New York] every three years?

'When you do an agreement it's done. That's it.'

Gallagher is currently fighting a war on two fronts as the financial arrangements from his divorce to ex-wife Nicole Appleton, with whom he has a son, Gene, 13, have not been resolved.

Until then his case against Ghorbani cannot be dealt with, he claims.Gallagher also has a daughter Molly, 16, and son Lennon, 15, from previous relationships.

In his attack on Gallagher, Ghorbani, a retired housing executive who lives in Washington, said that he could 'no longer maintain my silence'.

He said: 'Mr Gallagher has been given every opportunity to do the right thing by my granddaughter. He has had plenty of time to do so voluntarily but unfortunately he's failed.

'Instead, Mr Gallagher's adviser continues to spread misinformation, blaming our side for the lack of settlement while knowing full well that they are the ones who are continually delaying.'
