Homebuyers are being told to come clean about their spending on haircuts, bikini waxes, toiletries and the cost of feeding their pets - or risk being turned down for a mortgage.

Prying banks have started asking increasingly invasive questions of potential borrowers, quizzing them about their bills in every aspect of their lives.

Among the questions being asked are how much borrowers spend on personal grooming, dry cleaning, glasses, cleaning products and the size of their mobile phone bills.

Quiz: Potential homebuyers are being asked increasingly invasive questions

Many of Britain’s biggest banks already demand applicants give details of their monthly spending.

But experts say the questions are likely to become even more probing ahead of tough new rules to be introduced by consumer watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority in April.

Any applicant deemed to be extravagant will be penalised and in extreme cases refused a loan.

Last week, lender Kensington Mortgages unveiled the most detailed list spending questionnaire so far. It has 43 questions about borrowers’ spending.

They face having to comb through their bank statements to tot up splurges on meals out, visits to the dentist or the amount they fork out on contact lenses.

On top of food and clothing costs, potential borrowers also have to give details of the spending on their car’s annual MOT and reveal how much they typically pay to park their vehicle.

They must also detail how much they set aside to cover personal grooming.

Implications: Requests for as mortgage could be judged on how much you spend on pet food

This could include the cost of trips to a hairdresser or regular visits to a bikini waxing salon. Extras such as cinema or theatre trips are also weighed up by the lender.

Banks will then check these spending habits against their monthly statements to check their spending habits.

Risky behaviour? A trip to the cinema could determine whether or not you can buy your dream home

So if a bank sees you make regular visits to a beauty parlour, waxing salon or hairdresser, it could restrict the amount it lends you.

Paula Higgins, chief executive of campaign group the Homeowners Alliance, said: ‘This is outrageous. It is like treating people like children who have no control over their spending.

‘Banks and building societies already have access to our credit records in order to decide how much to lend to us.

‘I really don’t see what they have to gain by finding out how many chocolate bars someone eats a month or how much they spend on colouring their hair. It could also spark quite a few rows between couples who have tried to keep the full details of their spending private.’

Sarah Pennells, founder of moneysaving website Savvy Woman, said: ‘I can’t see any circumstances where a mortgage company would need to break down your spending in such detail.

‘Why on earth would they need to know you spend more on trips to the cinema than on highlights?’

Experts say big banks and building societies are racing to produce their own detailed questionnaires before the new lending rules kick in.

Virgin Money is asking mortgage applicants to describe their spending in dozens of areas.

These include the cost of their pooch but also phone and internet bills and spending on food and drink.

Two years ago the Mail revealed how Santander sparked outrage after demanding customers tell it how much they spend on celebrations such as birthdays and religious festivals.

Mortgage brokers say an increasing trend is for banks to grill borrowers about their spending on their pets, including vets bills. insurance premiums and trips to the grooming parlour.

Gym contracts and holidays have also come under the spotlight.

David Hollingworth, associate director of mortgage broker London and Country said: ‘The danger is that firms are asking for too much detail and people just won’t know what they spend.

‘For example, you may have a rough idea about what your car costs in petrol and insurance - but there are other costs too.

Credit: Critics have said that banks already have access to enough information to judge whether people should be lent money

‘There is no problem with the gist of the rules - but when you ask for too much detail it’s unwieldy for customers.

‘If you’re thinking about getting a mortgage you need to think about exactly where you spend your money.’

In April, the Financial Conduct Authority will bring in new rules based on its Mortgage Market Review.

These will mean banks and building societies are fully responsible for checking a borrower can properly afford a mortgage before giving them the cash.

If they are deemed to be lending irresponsibly they face big fines.

And they will also have to give borrowers’ finances a stress test, to ensure they can cope with a rise in repayments caused by an increase in mortgage rates.

Experts fear other banks will also soon by toughening their rules.

Aaron Strutt, product manager at mortgage broker Trinity Financial, says: ‘It stands to reason that if one mortgage company does this, then others will be hot on their heels.

‘Lenders are likely to ask even more detailed questions over the next few months as the new rules kick in.’

Alex Hammond, a spokesman for Kensington Mortgages says: ‘We are one of the first lenders to communicate what we are looking for in borrowers under the mortgage market review.

'We will not ask these questions in every case but on occasion we will ask for extra detail in terms of an applicant’s income and expenditure.’
