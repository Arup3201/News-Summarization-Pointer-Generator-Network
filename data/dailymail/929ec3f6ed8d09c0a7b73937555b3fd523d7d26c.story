The Romney campaign has accused Barack Obama of being a serial liar and the President’s aides hit back by suggesting the Republican candidate might have committed a felony as the 2012 election reached new heights of rancour.

After weeks of Republicans urging Mr Romney to hit back hard at attacks on his record at Bain Capital, his campaign released a new television ad entitled ‘No Evidence’ accusing Mr Obama of deceit in claiming that the former Massachusetts governor shipped jobs overseas while heading the venture capital firm.

The ad, which will run in several battleground states, asks voters: ‘When a president doesn't tell the truth, how can we trust him to lead?’ The press release which accompanied the ad in an email to journalists also referred to Mr Obama's ‘lies and exaggerations’.

But Mr Romney found himself on the defensive over a Boston Globe article citing federal documents filed by Bain Capital that conflicted with the presumptive Republican nominee’s statements about when he left Bain Capital.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in February 2001, Bain Capital listed Mr Romney as the company's ‘sole shareholder, sole director, chief executive officer and president’. It said Mr Romney's ‘principal occupation’ was as Bain's managing director.

Mr Romney's campaign, backed up by a number of independent fact checkers, has repeatedly said Mr Romney had almost nothing to do with the company's operations after February 1999, when he began work on the imperilled 2002 Winter Olympic Games.

Andrea Saul, Mr Romney’s spokeswoman, said that her boss ‘left Bain Capital in February of 1999 to run the Olympics, and had no input on investments or management of companies after that point’.

The significance of the period from 1999 to 2001 is that it covers the time when Bain oversaw investments that either sent jobs abroad or filed for bankruptcy. It's also when Mr Romney stated in federal disclosure forms that he was not active in Bain Capital.

For example, in late 1999, Bain-controlled Steam International set up overseas call centres, and a subsidiary moved jobs from California to Mexico. The following year, the Ampad company declared bankruptcy. In 2001, the steel maker GS Industries also fell to bankruptcy as Bain made $58.4million from its investment.

Republicans fear that the relentless attacks on Mr Romney, who is worth more than $250million, over his time at Bain Capital, his failure to release tax returns, his investments in Swiss bank accounts, Bermuda and the Caymans are defining him as an out-of-touch plutocrat.

The two presidential campaigns dispute how many American jobs were affected but the Romney campaign's line all along has been that it is irrelevant because Mr Romney wasn't involved in the company’s decisions for that period.

Stephanie Cutter, Mr Obama's deputy campaign manager, said that Mr Romney may have committed a felony if he misrepresented his role at Bain on the SEC documents. And if he was running Bain after 1999, Ms Cutter said, Mr Romney hasn't been truthful with the public.

‘If that's the case, if he was lying to the American people, then that's a real character and trust issue,’ she said.

Matt Rhoades, Mr Romney’s campaign manager, issued a blistering statement in response.

‘President Obama's campaign hit a new low today when one of its senior advisers made a reckless and unsubstantiated charge to reporters about Mitt Romney that was so over the top that it calls into question the integrity of their entire campaign,’ he said.

‘President Obama ought to apologize for the out-of-control behaviour of his staff, which demeans the office he holds. Campaigns are supposed to be hard fought, but statements like those made by Stephanie Cutter belittle the process and the candidate on whose behalf she works.’
