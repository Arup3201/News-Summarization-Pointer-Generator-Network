Fascinating maps have emerged that show the evolution of the London Underground from the early chaotic diagrams to the modern, familiar ones commuters use today.

They are an incredible record not only of the expanding tube system beneath the capital’s streets, but also the transformation in how the railway was depicted.

The maps, all duplicates produced at the same time as the originals, will go on sale in London this week and are expected to fetch thousands of pounds per item.

Look familiar? This map, dated from as far back as 1919 bares little resemblance to the modern day London Underground maps

Leaps and bounds: Seven years later, in 1926, this map by Reginald Percy Gossop has changed drastically from its 1919 counterpart

The major change came to the mapping of the network in 1933 when 
engineer Harry Beck drew his own map as a diagrammatic representation of
the subterranean system.

He cleverly realised that commuters did not need to know the exact route the trains took, just the order of the stops.

This is the one we are familiar with today and was what inspired underground network maps across the world.

The examples coming up for sale tomorrow are duplicates owned by the London Transport Museum.

The Underground maps begin in 1919 with one titled “Map of Underground including the Watford (L&N WR) Section”.

This uses just two colours - red and black - to show the lines of the railway and their true, meandering routes.

A 1926 version shows the tubes on the same map as the River Thames and the road network, and the colour yellow has been added to one line.Already in the 1920s Londoners were fascinated by the cartography depicting the city as is shown by a quirky map from 1928.

On it, the tube is superimposed on an 18th century map of the capital.

Ever evolving: This 1928 map by F. H. Stingemore is expected to sell for more than £2,000 and has reverted to a more familiar colour scheme

All Ways To The River: This curiously titled map by Charles Burton was produced in 1932 and even has pictures of boats on the Thames

Revert to type: F. H. Stingemore was back on the case in 1933, developing a similar map to his 1928 version

A Latin couplet at the bottom of the 1928 Underground Map upon the 1761 map states: 'This old map of London teaches you how many Underground roads there are today.'

Then in 1933 Mr Beck came up with his version that he completed in his own time and initially his Underground bosses were sceptical.

Sophie Churcher from Christie’s, which is selling the maps, said: “The London Underground Museum has a big archive and is selling some of its duplicate posters.

'This is to raise money for new acquisitions and conserve its existing stock.

'Among the collection are a series of London UNderground maps and through them you can see the network growing and growing.

'At first the maps followed the actual routes the trains took and they became more complicated as more track was laid.

'Then in 1933 Henry Beck revolutionised the process by coming up with the diagrammatic representation of the Underground.

Iconic: Harry Beck's 1933 map is remarkably similar to the version commuters use today

A similar shape: This 1934 Underground map, titled Central Area Map, started to take on a recognisable form

Getting there: Harry Beck's maps were a revolution after he came up with the diagrammatic representation that is used as today's model. The above was produced in 1937

'The different colours were already being used but his map is the one we are now familiar with.

'Beck was an engineer and draughtsman who worked on the Underground but at first his bosses were sceptical about the idea.

'But it clearly worked and influenced Underground maps around the world.

'The collection is also interesting because some of the maps include proposed routes that were never completed, such as a line to Muswell Hill.

'There is lots of cross appeal for these posters which were printed on surprisingly thin paper.

'They were made to be put up on the Underground, but were clearly expected to be replaced regularly.'

The maps go through to the early 1940s when the Underground was utilised by Londoners escaping the Blitz.

They are expected to sell for several thousand pounds each at the sale in London.

Astounding: Beck's 1938 version looks a far cry from the earlier ones

Still going: Ten years later, in 1948, Beck produced this map which possesses a striking resemblance to the present day's

Where we are now: Today's map looks extremely similar to those produced by Beck 80 years ago

As a solution to solve the problems of increased traffic congestion, the 1855 Act of Parliament was passed giving a green light to the construction of an underground rail network between Paddington and Farringdon Street via King’s Cross. It was to be named the Metropolitan Railway.

The railway finally opened in 1863 and the following year the Hammersmith and City Railway opened.

The underground railways rapidly expanded and eventually incorporated New Cross on the East London Railway and Whitechapel and Hounslow and Wimbledon on the District.

The Metropolitan expanded into the north-east of the city, creating a new suburb dubbed ‘Metro-land’ in the process which included Chesham, Watford and Harrow.

With the advancement of digging technologies, by the late 19th century the first tube lines were being created, and in 1890 the City and South London Railway, which now comprises of part of the Northern line, was opened.

In 1900 the Central London Railway – now known as the Central line – was opened, which spanned from Bank to Shepherd’s Bush.

Three years later the various privately owned railways merged into a London Passenger Transport Board, known as London Transport.  Harry Beck also drew his first Underground map in the current style in 1933.

In 1948, the Labour government – along with the four mainline railway companies – nationalised the ever-expanding network, becoming the London Regional Transport, which was eventually replaced by Transport for London in 2000.
