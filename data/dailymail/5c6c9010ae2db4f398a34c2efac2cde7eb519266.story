A man had an unfortunate experience when a routine trip to a public toilet in Ghana turned nasty.Â 

Kwabena Nkrumah, 34, was sitting on the loo in the Ashanti region when he felt a sharp pain on the tip of his manhood.

A snake had emerged from below and bit him on his penis.

According to  ghanaweb.com, when he looked into the toilet Mr Nkrumah nearly collapsed when he realised the snake was about to pounce on him again.

The porter screamed for help but that caused panic and fear among other people using the public lavatories.

Mr Nkrumah was taken to hospital after he started shivering and feeling dizzy but has since been discharged.

Speaking on Kessben FMs Breaking News programme, Mr Nkrumah said he initially thought the pain was normal until he saw the black snake lying just beneath him.
