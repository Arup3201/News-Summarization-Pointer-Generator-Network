The sailor who had to be rescued by the Navy along with his family during their trip across the Pacific will be grilled by his own mother upon his return, MailOnline can reveal.

Eric Kaufman will be questioned by mother Nancy Kopp when he gets back to dry and and she will say to him: ‘Are you done now?’

Nancy said that it might be time for Eric to rethink his adventurous lifestyle given that he has a wife and daughters Lyra, one, and Cora, three, who were on the trip.

Safety: Rescuers plucked Eric and Charlotte Kaufman and their daughters, Cora, 3, and Lyra, 1, from a sailboat in the Pacific Ocean on Sunday and transferred them to a U.S. Navy frigate that will take them back to California, the U.S Coast Guard said

Grilling: Eric faces some tough questions from his mother on his return. She hopes his adventuring days are over. But his wife's sister said she wouldn't be surprised if they took off again

However, the sister of Eric’s wife Charlotte said that she believes they will probably go to sea again despite their disastrous voyage.

Sariah Kay English said that she ‘wouldn’t be surprised’ if the family embarked on another odyssey and that they are ‘not embarrassed’ about the rescue.

Eric, 35, and Charlotte, 34, were saved 900 miles off the California coast on Thursday when Lyra developed a fever and a rash. Their 36-foot sailboat Rebel Heart also lost steering and communication abilities.

The California Air National Guard's 129th Rescue Wing flew a plane out to them and four pararescuers parachuted into the water where they used an inflatable life raft to get to them.

The USS Vandegrift was then diverted from routine exercises to pick them up and they are now bound for their home town of San Diego, California later this week.

Lyra’s fever is now under control and she is in a stable condition though she will be taken to hospital as a precaution.

Nancy said that she was supportive of Eric’s actions and that what happened was a ‘worst case scenario’, though obviously the family are still alive.

She accepted that she did not expect Eric to ‘sit on a couch your whole life’ but that ‘as a mother...these are things you worry about’.

She said: ‘My first question to Eric will be: ‘Did you have a great adventure?’ My second will be: ‘Are you done now?’

Rescue mission: Air National Guardsmen parachuted into the Pacific on Thursday evening to give medical aid to one-year-old Lyra

'First, we would like to express how grateful we are to the men and women of the Coast Guard, California Air National Guard and Navy who rescued our family, especially the pararescuemen and crew of USS Vandegrift.

We are very thankful to be safe and well. We also appreciate all the concern, thoughts and prayers of everyone back home for the health of our daughter Lyra. She is doing well now, and her medical condition continues to improve.'We understand there are those who question our decision to sail with our family, but please know that this is how our family has lived for seven years, and when we departed on this journey more than a year ago, we were then and remain today confident that we prepared as well as any sailing crew could.

The ocean is one of the greatest forces of nature, and it always has the potential to overcome those who live on or near it.

We are proud of our choices and our preparation, and while we are disappointed that we lost our sailboat and our home, we remain grateful for those who came to our aid and those family and friends who continue to encourage and support us. Thank you.'

Nancy, 68, added: ‘I first heard about this on Saturday morning when a friend called me up and said: ‘Get ready for this’. We almost passed away on the spot.

‘As a mother you can’t stop them, you can’t try. What am I going to do? Take away his (Eric’s) ice-cream?

‘It’s unfortunate but what can you do about it? I’m sorry it happened and I’m sorry for the expense’.

Eric’s step-father Lou, 78, added that he thought that sailing would have been a ‘fantastic education’ for Eric’s children and that the trip had been planned for years.

He said: ‘These people who say they should not have done that (the trip) - why not? Why shouldn’t a person live his life to the fullest and do what they can do?’

Speaking to MailOnline Sariah, who has spoken to Charlotte as she sails back on the Vandegrift, said that her sibling feels that they ‘did everything right’.

She said: ‘It’s just one of those things; people sail all the time around the world, they were just on the ship where it went wrong.

‘I would not be surprised if in the future there is another sailing trip, but that’s their choice.’

Sariah said that the trip was ‘not something that I would ever do’ but that Eric’s background in the Navy and their planning had reassured her.

The couple’s main concern now is the fate of the Rebel Heart, which was sunk by the Navy as it was taking on water.

Sariah said: ‘They are in shock about losing their boat. It was their home for six years. It’s the equivalent of somebody watching their house burn down.’

Sick bay: Charlotte and Lyra, who had a rash all over. It is believed she had a relapse of salmonella poisoning - which she had suffered from before they left

Day One  I can see the magic of being out to sea, but I can’t really taste it. Our children keep us too grounded to enjoy the esoterics of salty breezes, gigantic swells undulating around your boat like an erotic hula dancer, and a night sky dancing with laser beams of brilliance.Day Two Our foresail, stay sail, and main sail, hold fast, all strong and white, like our painted wooden mast, and I can feel their excitement to be used like this again; they were made for blue-water sailing, and apparently, so were we.Day Four Today started out sh**** too. It is so hard to keep a positive outlook at sea when you feel awful.Day Six I can’t possibly describe the range of emotions I have felt so far: anger, joy, sickness, exhaustion, exhilaration, wonder, awe, contentment, peace.Day Eight I think this may be the stupidest thing we have ever done ... [but] not everyone gets to realize their dreams in life.Day Eleven When I woke up this morning my back muscles were tight from the constant rocking you can’t escape at night.Day Thirteen Thirteen days at sea ... We are in good spirits, as good as you can be, considering.Three days later the family contacted the Coast Guard for help

Eric and Charlotte’s odyssey began when they left San Diego in 2012 and went to Puerto Vallarta in Mexico to deliver Lyra.

They had to wait another year for good weather to cross the Pacific.

Critics have not been quite so charitable, however, and pointed out that Lyra was sick with salmonella just a week before her parents set sail on their trans-Pacific journey.

A doctor had given her a clean bill of health but when the salmonella returned they had to call for help because the antibiotics they were using had no effect.

The Navy and the Coast Guard have declined to reveal the cost of the whole rescue operation, which will be almost a week long once finished.

Eric and Charlotte will speak to the media upon their return but for now have released a statement which they sent via the captain of the Vandegrift.

It read: ‘We are proud of our choices and our preparation, and while we are disappointed that we lost our sailboat and our home, we remain grateful for those who came to our aid and those family and friends who continue to encourage and support us’.

Critics called the family ‘reckless’ and said that they should have put their children first.

Captain Alec Fraser, the former captain of the USS O’Brien and the USS Cape St George, told MailOnline: ‘My opinion is that that exercised poor judgement and that having to call for help could cause other ships to put themselves in danger.

‘They may be able to sail across the Pacific, but I would call into question their judgement.’

Captain Fraser added that if it was his ship that was responding to the emergency call and he found out what happened he would be ‘disgusted’ at the couple.

Rough seas: Eric and Charlotte have faced criticism over their trip - not least from their family. But they have defended their actions

Eric and Charlotte are unlikely to have to pay for the rescue as the Coast Guard does not charge for search and rescue operations.

Whilest the Navy has not revealed how much the operation cost, given the distances and the resources involved it will be hundreds of thousands of dollars.
