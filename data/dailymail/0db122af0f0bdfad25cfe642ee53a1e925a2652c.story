The
 News of the World hacked phones belonging to Kate Middleton, Prince 
William and Prince Harry more than 200 times, revealing intimate details
 about their private lives.

Personal
 messages left by the Duke of Cambridge for his ‘babykins’ future wife 
also revealed how he was almost shot during an Army exercise.

The
 future king also ribbed his brother for being 'ginger' in a message 
left on his phone where he adopted a high-pitched voice and pretended to
 be Harry's then girlfriend Chelsy Davy.

Intercepted: Prince William and his future wife Kate Middleton were both hacked habitually while he was at Sandhurst in 2006, with the NotW printing a series of exclusives using intimate information about their relationship

The
 habitual hacking led to a number of exclusives for the tabloid, 
including one claiming that Harry had asked an aide to help him cheat in
 his Sandhurst exams.

William
 was also revealed as a keen 'beagler' - a form of hunting where rabbits
 and hares are chased by packs of the dogs - and would would always call
 Kate 'baby' and 'darling'.

Clive Goodman exposed a joke by Prince William after hacking into Prince Harry's voicemail messages, the court heard.

The
 jury were read a transcript of a tape recovered in 2006 apparently left
 on Prince Harry's phone pretending to be girlfriend Chelsy Davy 
(pictured together above).

In it, he was dubbed a 'big, hairy fat ginger', and told 'you really are quite ugly for a ginger', the court heard.

The
 jokey message, delivered in a high pitched voice with a South African 
accent, was attributed to Prince William in one of Goodman's stories 
printed on April 9,, 2006

The
 message said: 'Hi its Chelsy here, I just want to say I miss you so 
much, and I think you're the most - best looking ginger I've ever seen.

'Although you really are quite ugly for a ginger, I hope you're having a lovely time, I really miss you.

'It's lovely out here in Africa and hopefully I'll see you very soon, you big hairy fat ginger, anyway, speak to you later.'

Among
 the details of voicemails discovered by detectives at the home of 
private investigator Glenn Mulcaire was another call from William in 
which he said: ‘My head’s all right. I’ve just picked up your message. 
Oh, my little babykins! I hope you are all right.

‘I
 just tried ringing you but I do not think you would pick it up because 
it is 5.35am in the morning so it is probably not a very good time to 
ring you. I hope you are all right.’

In
 another message William says: ‘Hello baby, it’s me. Sorry I did not 
ring you earlier and tell you what I was doing. Been a bit of a 
nightmare day. I think I would just about be finished in a minute.

‘It
 has just gone six but I don’t think I will be able to leave here till 
about seven. I have got stuff here to do, bits and pieces, but I should 
be able to leave at about seven at the least. Crack on with what you 
have got to do and don’t worry about me. I will give you a buzz later.

Prosecutor 
Andrew Edis QC read the Old Bailey transcripts of the voice recordings –
 made in 2006 – which were discovered by detectives investigating 
hacking allegations. In one, William started by saying: ‘Hi baby’, 
adding: ‘Had a busy day today again.

‘I’ve
 been running around the woods of Aldershot chasing shadows and getting 
terribly lost, and I walked into some other regiment’s ambush, which was
 slightly embarrassing because I nearly got shot. Not by live rounds but
 by blank rounds, which would be very embarrassing though.

‘Um,
 er, yeah, I’m off on exercise tomorrow morning, just for the day, and 
then I’m back on Saturday first thing, erm, so I probably won’t be able 
to speak to you tomorrow night.’

He
 then told her he might send her ‘a cheeky text message’ because he 
might have his phone with him, before signing off: ‘All right, baby, 
lots of love, um, speak to you soon. Bye bye.’

In another call, William talks of wanting to go on a drag hunt with beagles: 
‘Hi honey, it’s me. I’m back in the small land of Sandhurst. A couple of
 pretty nasty days on exercise. Decided to just enjoy them. I am feeling
 a bit s***** at the moment but hope you are OK. Lovely to speak to 
you...

‘You are probably 
very busy working but if there is any chance you are free, maybe later 
this afternoon or evening, I might be able to get out. I am going to try
 and go out beagling again and then come to you afterwards.

‘So
 if you are around at home this evening I would love to see you. Let me 
know. Give me a text or ring back. I am around about the rest of the 
day.’

Kate Middleton was 
hacked the most, 155 times including at least once on Christmas Day 2005
 - almost six years before she married. William was hacked 35 times and 
Harry's nine times.

NotW
 editor Clive Goodman admitted Kate was targeted because she 'was a 
figure of increasing importance around the Royal Family' and was already
 'settling down' with the heir to the throne.

Key document: This list was found in the home of hacker Mulcaire, and Kate Middleton can clearly be seen written down along with other famous people. Boris Johnson was on the list but has been scrubbed out by the Crown Prosecution Service

Her name also appeared on a list
 kept by the paper's £100,000-a-year hacker Glenn Mulcaire, scribbled on
 lined paper alongside Boris Johnson, Max Clifford and Sven-Goran 
Eriksson.

Exclusive: The News of the World ran a story claiming Prince Harry asked for help with coursework while at Sandhurst, pictured, which was 'based entirely on a voicemail', the court heard

Prince
 Harry’s voicemail was also intercepted, the phone-hacking trial was 
told, but several stories also came from the hacking of his aides or 
associates.

A message pleading for help with an essay was left on the mobile 
phone of his private secretary, Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton. In a transcript
 read to the court, the Prince is heard asking the former SAS major for 
help in writing an essay about the Iranian Embassy siege in London in 
1980.

He said: ‘I just need some information. I
 have got most of the stuff but if you have got any extra information or
 websites that you knew of, please, please, please email it me or text 
me but I’ll try to ring you again later.’

A hacked Lowther-Pinkerton voicemail also revealed Prince William was booted out of an Army party for 
‘braying Hooray Henry’ antics in front of horrified guests, the court 
heard.

Goodman also said Kate Middleton
 shunned the party and did not get on with Harry’s then-girlfriend 
Chelsy Davy.

Prosecutor 
Andrew Edis QC introduced the email alongside a hacked message recovered
 by police from royal aide Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton left by Sandhurst 
commandant Major General Andrew Ritchie referring to an ‘incident at the
 ball’.

Goodman wrote: 
'William and his group were massively drunk and upsetting other guests 
with their braying Hooray Henry antics. One of his friends was strutting
 around the hall pretending to be a brigadier… William himself was sent 
upstairs to bed before the ball ended.'

A story 
containing large parts of Goodman’s claims appeared on April 16, 2006, 
under the headline ‘So silly Willy’, the court heard.

Former Sun editor Rebekah Brooks was accused of approving an illegal £4,000 payment for 
the picture of the Prince posing as a Bond girl in a green bikini.

The
 45-year-old was told the exclusive picture came from a reporter’s ‘best
 contact at Sandhurst’ who wanted the cash to pay for his wife to go on a
 course, it is alleged.

The
 embarrassing photo was taken at a 007-themed party held in the cricket 
pavilion of the military academy, but was never published.

Kate Middleton also attended the fancy-dress party and was said to have worn a wetsuit.

A reporter sent an email saying the picture belonged to Prince William’s 
direct platoon commander where the Royal was training in 2006, the court
 heard.

When Brooks was asked by email: ‘What do you think boss?’, she replied ten minutes later saying: ‘OK’.

The
 court was shown paperwork from The Sun showing a £4,000 payment 
was made on June 16, 2006, with the reference: ‘Prince William bikini 
exclusive’.

But a story 
linked to this alleged payment did not appear until September 9, 2006, 
accompanied with a crude mock-up of the Prince’s face on a man’s bikini 
clad body.

The story read: 
‘Prince William caused a stir at a Sandhurst 007 bash by dressing as a 
Bond girl’ and also revealed his then-girlfriend Kate Middleton attended
 the party dressed in a wetsuit as James Bond and brandishing a toy gun.
