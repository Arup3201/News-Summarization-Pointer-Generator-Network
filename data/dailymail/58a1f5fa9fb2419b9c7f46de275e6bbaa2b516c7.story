The fire at his Malibu house was not minor.

Brosnan, who was home with  Smith and two of his sons at the time, Dylan and Paris, could be seen distraught as he spoke on his phone while firefighters put out the blaze.

TMZ report that Brosnan said in his 911 call 'I've got to go now in case I get blown up.'

Investigators stayed on the scene at the 13,000 square-foot residence for hours after the blaze was put out as they tried to determine what the cause was.

One neighbor, Andy Stern, claimed; 'Their last house totally burned down several years ago, then it took them several years to build this house.'

Keely wore a low-cut black tank top, which she coupled with a coordinating, fitted black skirt and a large straw hat.
