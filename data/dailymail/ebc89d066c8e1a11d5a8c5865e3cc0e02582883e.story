Taxpayers are forking out £2,000 a day for David Cameron’s grace-and-favour country retreat, it emerged today.

The Prime Minister has access to Chequers – a sprawling Buckinghamshire mansion just an hour and a half from Downing Street – as a perk of the job.

The mansion has been the weekend home of successive Prime Ministers since 1921. But the eye-watering cost of running the country escape as sparked calls for a review of how it is run.

Mr Cameron regularly uses the retreat to relax as well as to entertain foreign dignitaries and Tory MPs.

Figures released to the Sun on Sunday show it is now setting back taxpayers £700,000 a year.

The huge sum — nearly four times the average cost of a family home — goes on staff and maintenance.

The scale of the bill has sparked calls for a crackdown on its use — or even opening up the 16th-century Buckinghamshire pile to the public like Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle.

Andy Silvester, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: “It should never be used for donor dinners and political ends.

“How about opening it to the public for a couple of months a year so taxpayers can see what they’re paying for?”

Mr Cameron showed the Queen around Chequers in February this year. The mansion has its own tennis court, which the Prime Minister is known to enjoy using

The Cabinet Office handed £2.165million grant-in-aid to the Chequers Trust — which runs the estate — in the first three years Mr Cameron was in office.

A Downing Street source said yesterday: “The cost of running it has come down under the Conservatives.”

Mr Cameron enjoys entertaining political rivals, friends and even foreign leaders at the Buckinghamshire estate.

But it emerged earlier this month that Boris Johnson, the London mayor, has turned down five separate invitations to stay with Mr Cameron at Chequers, it has emerged.

Mr Cameron repeatedly extended his hospitality to the London Mayor, his wife Marina and their four children in the two and a half years since he was elected, but was turned down each time on the grounds that Mr Johnson was "too busy".

A source close to the Mayor told the Sun that the real reason he had declined the invitations was because he was not a fan of the Prime Minister, who he has known since the pair attended Eton College together in the 1980s.

A Downing Street source denied that there were serious tensions between the two men, saying: “David and Boris are actually quite close. Boris has a busy diary too, and the PM understands that.”
