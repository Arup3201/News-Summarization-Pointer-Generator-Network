Goodbye Britain: Actress Gwyneth Paltrow is to move her family to Los Angeles for at least two years to be closer to her mother and brother

She has lived in London for a decade and calls it her ‘adopted home’, but Oscar-winner Gwyneth Paltrow is moving her family back to Los Angeles.

The 40-year-old actress and her rock-star husband Chris Martin of Coldplay plan to make LA their home for at least the next two years.

The family will move in time for their children Apple, nine, and Moses, seven, to start the school term in September.

A source said: ‘Gwyneth has loved living in London but America will always be home and she wants to be closer to her family.

'Her mother and brother live in California and she plans to spend the next couple of years in Los Angeles while her children are young enough for their education not to be affected.

‘She misses her family terribly and now is the time to move.

'Her children have English accents and once they start senior school Gwyneth says the family will likely return to the UK because she believes that the English education system is second to none.’

Rumours have been rife for months that the family was planning to move back to California after they forked out £6.6 million on an opulent new home in a private Hollywood Hills estate.

The 8,000 square-foot house in the exclusive Brentwood area is the most expensive in the couple’s property empire which includes their £4.6 million home in North London, a £3.2 million penthouse flat in New York and a £3.4 million house in the Hamptons near New York.

Designed by renowned US architect Windsor Smith the home has six bedrooms, eight bathrooms and a separate stable block.

Paltrow, famed for her eco-friendly ways, even had an entrance hall made with stones recovered from a Peruvian schoolhouse.

Friends say Gwyneth longs to spend more time with her 70-year-old widowed mother Blythe Danner and her director brother Jake as well as friends like godfather Steven Spielberg: ‘Gwyneth misses her family terribly and while she has grown to love London and her children have English accents, now is the time to move.

'The kids have said goodbye to their school friends and they are having a final European holiday before the big move.’

Moving? Gwyneth and husband Chris Martin (pictured) already own properties in Los Angeles and New York as well as London.
