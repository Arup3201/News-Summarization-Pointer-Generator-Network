Four plants in China that produce treats for American-based companies refused to let FDA investigators take samples for analysis, a new report claims.

The Food and Drug Administration has received thousands of complaints from pet owners saying the tainted treats led to the deaths of their beloved animals.

But Chinese government officials would only let FDA workers take samples if they allowed the treats to be tested by Chinese laboratories, sending the investigators back empty-handed.

Tainted treats: Waggin' Train, left, owned by Nestle Purina but manufactured in China, as well as Canyon Creek Ranch Chicken Tenders, have been accused of causing more than 2,000 pet illnesses and deaths in the U.S.

NBC News obtained a copy of the records, citing FDA official Dennis Doupnik, who confirmed that no samples were collected during the visit in April.

The four plants in China - Gambol Pet Products Co. Ltd.; Shandong Honva Food Co. Ltd.; and Shandong Petswell Food Co. Ltd, as well as and Jinan Uniwell Pet Food Co. Ltd., all produce treats for Nestle Purina PetCare Co.

Among the treats made are the popular Waggin’ Train jerky.

NBC News, citing the FDA report, said that none of the factories performed any routine tests on the raw materials.

More than 2,000 reports have been sent to the FDA of dog treats made in China that have resulted in illness or death of a pet, the news outlet said.

However, spokesperson for Nestle Purina assured NBC News that the FDA’s evidence is unfounded. ‘There was no attempt by Nestle Purina for the Chinese facilities to restrict sample collection,’ Keith Schopp said.

He added that the treats remain safe for pets' consumption.

Indeed, in the past five years, the FDA has been unable to find significant contamination levels in dog treats made in China and sold in the States.

Fatality: Bella, a 2-year-old pug, died after her owner said she ate the Waggin' Train chicken jerky treat

Kidney failure: Ginger, a 14-year-old dog, died from the disease though it is unclear whether that was a direct result of the chicken jerky treats

Earlier this year, the FDA cited Waggin' Train, Canyon Creek Ranch jerky treats and Milo's Kitchen Home-style Dog Treats in several cases of illness.

But FDA officials warn that repeated tests have not shown a definitive tie to the three dog treat brands.

'No specific products have been recalled because a definitive cause has not been determined,' FDA officials said in a statement.

Nestle Purina and Del Monte, makers of the three cited dog treats, insist that their products are safe.

A series of complaints from dog owners and veterinarians suggest jerky treats made in China are responsible for a series of dog illnesses, including kidney failure, liver disease and Fanconi syndrome, which can lead to death in severe cases.

Recent complaints have been filed by dog owners across the United States.

'We still invite owners and veterinarians to submit complaints and samples,' Siobhan DeLancey, an FDA spokeswoman, told MSNBC.

'The more information we have, the more likely we can find a link.'

Bella, a 2-year-old pug, is one of the fatalities thought to have been caused by the Waggin' Train chicken jerky treats.

Another, 14-year-old Ginger, died from kidney failure and her owners filed a complaint against one of the dog treat companies.
