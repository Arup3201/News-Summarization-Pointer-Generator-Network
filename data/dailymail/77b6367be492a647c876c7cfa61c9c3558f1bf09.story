Sean Dyche celebrates two years in charge of a Burnley side dented but not broken by their winless start to life back in the Barclays Premier League.

The Clarets boss, who took over on October 30, 2012 with the side 13th in the Championship, needs no reminding that Burnley are the only club in the top four tiers of English football without a victory.

Breaking that sequence does not get any easier, with a trip to the Emirates to face Arsenal to come on Saturday.

Sean Dyche's said his side are using criticism as a motivation, Burnley are yet to win in the league this season

Burnley are already being talked about in the context of worst ever Premier League seasons.

No team has ever failed to win a game during a campaign, although Derby only managed one in 2007-08, while QPR went 16 games without a victory at the start of the 2012-13 season.

Not that Dyche is concerned by what has gone before, and he is not shying away from the reality of the situation.

'Whether it hurts or not is irrelevant,' he said. 'The fact is it's a fact. What it does is gives you the added motivation to get wins.

'The only thing I ever guaranteed when I came here was that I'd have a group of motivated people giving everything they can, and that's exactly what we've still got.

Burnley have endured a torrid start to the season, and lost 3-1 to Everton in their last outing

'Now we've got to give even more, because that's what you've got to do to win matches in the Premier League.

'I'm used to winning and this group's used to winning, so that's been something we have to get our head around and allow the players the freedom to play to move forward.

'I've been down this road before. I've had a spell here when we didn't win games, I've been at Watford when we didn't win games.

'It's very rare that managers have it comfortable for year after year. Even Arsene Wenger was questioned after the first game last season.

'I'm learning plenty from it, that's for sure. It affects me in that my instinct is to win, and it has been since I was a little kid. That's the bit that dents you, but it doesn't break you.

'It's not about proving anyone wrong, it's about proving ourselves right.'

Just as Dyche does not subscribe to the doom-laden predictions for his club, he also does not read anything into those criticising Arsenal's start to the season.

The Gunners have won only once at home in the league, on the opening day against Crystal Palace, and needed a late goal to draw with Hull two weeks ago.

'We really look at ourselves,' said Dyche, whose side held Manchester United to a draw at Turf Moor in August.

'It's another fantastic challenge, particularly away from home. Arsenal have changed massively over the years to what they are now from when I was playing, they're a completely different animal and recognised in a worldwide market.

'We've had some huge clubs already, mainly at home, and this is one of the super powers away from home.'
