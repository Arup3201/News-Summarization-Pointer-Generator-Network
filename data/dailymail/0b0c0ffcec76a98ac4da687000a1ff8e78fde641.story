The heads of Gladiators brutally killed for the amusement of Roman audiences may have been fed to dogs, it has been revealed.

Skulls discovered within the boundaries of ancient London a quarter of a century ago are now believed to be those of gladiators - and the first results from the analysis of them has uncovered shocking new details.

'It is not a pretty picture,' Rebecca Redfern, from the centre for human bioarchaeology at the museum of London, said.

Skulls discovered within the boundaries of ancient London a quarter of a century ago are now believed to be those belonging to gladiators, brutally killed for the amusement of Roman audiences. This skull shows sharp force injuries

'At least one of the skulls shows evidence of being chewed at by dogs, so it was still fleshed when it was lying in the open.'

The first analysis of the haul of 39 skulls, discovered beneath the site of the Guildhall in the City of London, was published this week.

'Examination of the sample using techniques employed by forensic anthropology and entomology found that some of the material had been deposited in open waterlogged pits,' the report says.

'The majority of the sample was adult males who had evidence for multiple peri-mortem blunt- and sharp- force injuries; many also had healed injuries, suggesting that violence was a common feature of their life.'

They were discovered in 1988 and were believed to have originated from human remains washed out of burial sites by the Walbrook, one of the area’s lost rivers.

But now after 25 years in storage, the remains have been re-examined by an historian from the Museum of London, who believes they are the first evidence of gladiators in London.

Studies have revealed that most of the skulls show signs of injury before death  - despite them dying during peace time.

Rebecca Redfern, of the museum's Centre for Human Bioarchaeology, now believes that the skulls are either the result of sacrificial headhunting, or the remains of gladiators, killed for sport.

Some of the heads had been decapitated and one of the haul had part of its jawbone sliced off - almost all had been the victims of violence - The Independent reports.

'The level of violence here exceeds the level needed to kill someone', Dr Redfern said, adding that they showed 'lethal, multiple blows to the head' alongside healed injuries consistent with a brutal life.

The full findings of her research will be published this week in the Journal of Archaeological Science.

The skulls were discovered in a pit beneath what is now a Waterstones bookshop - at 52 - 63 London Wall - which was excavated in 1988.

The area was an industrial one in Roman times known as the Upper Walbrook Valley.

Although historians have known about the existence of an amphitheatre at the site for many years, Dr Redfern said it was the first time physical evidence of gladiators had been found in London. 

She said: 'It’s utterly, utterly amazing. We don’t have evidence for this type of thing in Roman London.

She added: 'There is no primary source evidence for gladiators in London... There is a gladiator tombstone, but we think it was brought to Britain (from Europe no earlier than the 17th century).

The Times reports that the remains were thrown into the pits between 120 and 160 AD - which was peace time in Roman Britain.

Dr Redfern said the bones were not supposed to have been in the pits at all as this was within the walls of the City - where corpses were not supposed to have been buried.

In August construction workers in London made an 'unexpected and fascinating discovery' during work on the city's billion pound Crossrail project.

Around
 20 Roman skulls were unearthed by tunnellers working beneath 
Liverpool Street Station, where the historic River Walbrook flows.

Another haul of skulls and pottery was recently found below the site of the historic Bedlam burial ground. Bedlam hospital was a psychiatric asylum and patients who died while at the hospital were buried in a cemetery first established in the 16th century

Working
 under the direction of Crossrail's archaeologists, the construction 
workers carefully removed the human skulls and Roman pottery.

They were found buried in clusters in the sediment of the historic tributary.

For
 safety reasons the archaeologists had to leave the work to the 
tunnellers as the skulls were buried as deep as six metres below ground.

The cross-London scheme has already led 
to a number of exciting discoveries, including around 4,000 skeletons 
found buried in the Eldon Street area.

The River Walbrook formed from 
tributaries coming from Shoreditch, Barbican and merging in the Finsbury
 Circus area of Central London.

It
 flows through the middle of the City of London beneath the Bank of 
England and joins the Thames between Southwark and Cannon Street 
Bridges.

It is believed to 
be named after a brook that ran through the London Wall, built by the 
Romans around London to protect the city.

Romans
 built the Temple of Mithras, which worshipped the ancient religion of 
Mithraism, on the banks of the Walbrook in the 3rd century AD.This 
temple was found during construction work in the 1950's.

Following the invasion of
 the Anglo-Saxons in the 6th century, Britons were forced to live on the
 east bank of the Walbrook, while the Saxons lived on the west.

The
 Walbrook began being covered by buildings in 1440 and it now runs 
entirely underground, running parallel to a street called Walbrook.

These skeletons will be carefully removed 
during major archaeological excavations this year.

The discovery of the skulls and pottery was made below the site of the historic Bedlam burial ground.

Bedlam
 hospital was a psychiatric asylum and patients who died while at the 
hospital were buried in a cemetery first established in the 16th 
century.

Historically, Roman skulls have been found along the Thames tributary Walbrook during various excavations in the region. 

This
 led to speculation the skulls found were heads decapitated by Queen 
Boudicca's army during the rebellion against Roman occupation in the 1st
 century AD.
