Scientists believe that all human life started in Africa six million years ago.

But the evolutionary mystery of how monkeys arrived in South America has baffled them for years, however, this mystery may finally have been solved.

New fossil evidence collected by curators at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles, California suggests that the monkeys may have managed to journey across the Atlantic from Africa by sea.

Different species: Brown Capuchin Monkey's (Sapajus libidinosus) are seen on a tree on the banks of the Paraguay river, in Caceres, Brazil,  at the gateway to the Pantanal

Discovery: The origins of just how South American monkeys arrived in South America, including these woolly monkeys in the Amazon in Brazil, may finally have been uncovered

The revealing fossils were discovered along a riverbank in the east Peruvian Amazon in 2010 near a notoriously challenging place for researchers to work.

In 2012, Ken Campbell, a curator at the museum took a closer look at the fossils and soon realized that they belonged to a primitive monkey similar to ones found in Africa. 

He discovered that the fossils also showed that the monkeys arrived on the continent at least 36 million years ago. Previous fossil records dated the monkey's arrival back at just 26 million years.

Campbell told Fox News.com:  'The Amazon is a bit of a difficult place to work because there are no outcrops to speak of because they're all covered by forest. 

'And so the only outcrops that one finds are along riverbanks, and that means that you can only look for fossils during the dry season, when the rivers are at their lowest point.' 

Campbell said: 'One of the teeth [we found] is very, very similar to a fossil tooth from Africa.

'In paleontology, when the specimens that you have look very similar then that's a general indication of comparable ancestry. 

'So the fact that these two teeth are very similar suggests - not prove, but suggests - that there might be a relationship between them.'

According to researchers the types of fossils found in South America show that it has always been home to many different  animals. 

Yet, just how monkeys arrived on the island nation has been shrouded in mystery.  

Campbell said: 'The general hypothesis is that - first of all, these monkeys were very small. They're about the size of a small squirrel with a long tail. 

'So they're very small and as a consequence their food and water requirements would be much less than if they were very large. 

'So the general hypothesis is that there were monkeys on a river bank. During flood season, trees get swept into the river and carried out to the ocean. 

'As vegetation rafts, [the trees are] carried across on the Atlantic based on wind and current directions. 

'This remains a hypothesis- there's no proof yet, although the similarities between the monkeys suggests that it did happen.'  

'Finding primates was a possibility, but they are very rare and very small. So in the end, it was a surprise.'
