When workmen botched the job of building her new home and left her £160,000 out of pocket, Carol Sullivan knew exactly what to do.

The 50-year-old lawyer went on a bricklaying course – and then built the house herself.

She said she had no choice but to learn the construction skills after losing the money she had saved to transform her bungalow into a luxury home.

The rogue tradesmen bungled the 
building of the foundations and exterior walls for the new house, 
leaving a shell that had to be demolished for safety reasons.

Mrs
 Sullivan tried to get her money back through the courts, but the 
builders disappeared with nothing in their bank account.

Devastated but 
undeterred, she enrolled on a week-long £250 bricklaying course and set 
about building the house from scratch.

She
 went on to learn the basics of plumbing and carpentry on similar 
courses. A year to the day after she began work she moved into the 
detached four-bedroom house, now said to be worth £1million.

The 
property in Kempshott, near Basingstoke, Hampshire, cost her £180,000 to
 build on top of the money she had already lost.

Mrs
 Sullivan said that all had appeared to be going well with the original 
building work until a cold snap of weather.

‘To my horror the mortar 
started to fall out of the new walls,’ she said. ‘The builders said 
there was nothing wrong.’

Troubles: Torrential rain battered the building project before Mrs Sullivan could get a roof on the home - flooding the ground floor

But
 a test by the Institute of Builders showed the workmen had used only 
one shovel of mortar for every 19 shovels of sand – a normal ratio would
 be four or five to one.

Mrs
 Sullivan said: ‘I was totally gutted and ordered the builders to leave 
the site immediately. I got the foundations checked and they too weren’t
 sufficient.

'Because the house was unsafe I had no choice but to 
completely knock it down.

‘I
 didn’t do anything with the site for a while and then one day I said to
 my husband, Viv, “Can it really be that hard to lay bricks?”

'I found a 
week-long course that started the following Monday for £250. Viv was 
very supportive and came with me.

‘Normally
 these courses teach you to build a garden wall, an arch and a chimney 
breast. I said to the tutors that I’d like to learn how to build a 
house. I knew it would be a huge challenge but I didn’t have any other 
choice.’

She put her job as a
 divorce lawyer on hold to get up at 6am and spend the day laying bricks
 from Monday to Friday, with Mr Sullivan, 58, helping her at weekends.

Determined: Cowboy builders left the lawyer, 50, without a home but she turned adversity into triumph by learning the skills to build the house herself

 ‘A
 year to the day since I started we moved in,’ she said. ‘At that point 
the house was just a shell. I did everything from the plumbing to the 
electrics to the carpentry.

'The only things I couldn’t do was the 
roofing, levelling the concrete and the plaster work.

‘I’m over the moon. I could have chucked it all in but I stuck at it and have the house of my dreams.’
