Chelsea striker Didier Drogba believes the 'winning spirit is coming' for the Blues squad following Tuesday's 6-0 win over Maribor.

Jose Mourinho's side ran riot at Stamford Bridge against the Slovenian champions as Drogba scored his first goal for the club since returning to west London in the summer from the penalty spot.

The frontman believes the current Chelsea squad is packed with quality and told ITV after the victory: 'The winning spirit is coming. The desire to score goals together as a team is good.

'We have a lot more quality than in previous Chelsea teams I played with. The team is younger but there is still room for improvement.' 

Drogba - who doubled Chelsea's lead after requesting usual penalty taker Eden Hazard step aside - was desperate to get off the mark.

'I have to be honest I wanted to score. I asked (Hazard) and he said yes.

'This is the spirit we have in this team. We share goals and they help with my confidence,' laughed the 36-year-old.

While Chelsea boss manager Mourinho wasn't initially impressed with Hazard's decision to accept Drogba's request, the Portuguese admitted it was good to see the striker complete 75 minutes after coming on for the injured Loic Remy.

With Diego Costa and Remy expected to miss Sunday's trip to Manchester United, Mourinho may have to turn to Drogba.

Asked if he expected to play at Old Trafford, Drogba replied: 'I don't know, the manager will decide. I'm available for the team as always. 

Loic Remy's injury could pose a serious problem for Chelsea, who travel to Manchester United next Sunday
