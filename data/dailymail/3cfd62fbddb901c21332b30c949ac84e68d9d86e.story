Trade union influence on Labour has turned the party into a ‘Monty Python parody of the Soviet Union’, Nick Clegg claimed yesterday.

The Deputy Prime Minister said something ‘seriously dodgy’ had  happened in the safe Labour seat  of Falkirk, where the Unite union  is accused of trying to fix the selection of the new parliamentary candidate.

Ed Miliband has refused to reopen an abandoned internal inquiry into Falkirk, despite the emergence of fresh evidence of wrongdoing, which is now being investigated  by the police.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said Labour leader Ed Miliband had to 'come clean' about what had happened in Falkirk

Mr Clegg said it was time for the Labour leader to ‘come clean’.

‘It’s like some sort of Monty Python parody of the Soviet Union,’ he said on Call Clegg, his weekly phone-in on LBC radio.

‘The Labour Party leadership appear to be puppets on a string run by these trade union bosses.

‘Something seriously dodgy clearly happened in Falkirk. It really is time for the Labour Party leadership to come clean.’

Unite is alleged to have signed up people in Falkirk to the Labour Party without their knowledge in a bid to fix the outcome of the selection.

The union, Labour’s biggest donor, has furiously denied any wrongdoing.

The Falkirk row centres on claims the Unite union tried to influence the selection of Labour's candidate in the Scottish town.

Karie Murphy is an old friend of Unite boss Len McCluskey, and was the union's preferred choice.

There are claims that Unite signed up people to become Labour members in the seat in the hope of influencing the result, without their knowledge.

The Labour constituency chairman is Stephen Deans, the Unite official at the centre of a dispute which nearly closed the Grangemouth oil refinery.

Mr Deans and Ms Murphy were suspended from the party after Labour called in the police, but were reinstated in September after a Labour investigation concluded without finding evidence of wrong-doing.

Since then whistleblowers have denied claims they withdrew their evidence and demanded action.

But Mr Miliband has refused to reopen the inquiry.

It
follows the publication of emails from constituency chairman Stephen 
Deans which opponents claimed raised fresh questions about alleged 
attempts to rig the vote in favour of a candidate backed by the Unite 
union.

Union official Mr 
Deans and Unite's favoured candidate, Karie Murphy, were reinstated in 
September after a Labour investigation concluded without finding 
evidence of wrong-doing.

Mr
Miliband has refused to publish the inquiry's report amid questions 
over its key finding that allegations of members being recruited without
their knowledge had been withdrawn.

To add to the row, yesterday another former candidate for the Falkirk nomination, Gregor Poynton, told The Guardian that he had paid for 11 members to join the Falkirk constituency party with a single cheque of £137 last July, adding: ‘I believe that I have at all times acted within the rules.’

It emerged this week that Unite handed Labour almost £800,000 after Mr Miliband dropped his inquiry into claims it had been involved in vote-rigging.

Official figures revealed that Unite donated £777,740 a fortnight after the Labour leader reinstated Mr Deans and Ms Murphy who had been suspended.

The huge cheque was almost a quarter of the £3.1million donated to the party in the third quarter of this year.
