The 37-year-old man who ran away with a 15-year-old girl has been charged with sex abuse and faces life in prison, it was revealed today.

Robert Messer befriended teenager Emily Lalinksy's mother, Lisa Schwartz, through their church in Plymouth Township, Michigan and had known the 15-year-old since she was a little girl.

Today Lieutenant Cal Lauria told MailOnline: 'He has been charged on six counts. Count one, Criminal Sexual Conduct in the first degree, which carries life imprisonment.

'Counts two through five, Criminal Sexual Conduct in the third degree, each count carrying a 15 year penalty and Count six Accosting a Minor which carries a four years.'

Besotted: Messer posted this picture of Emily on Instagram boasting 'Looks like someone knows a secret'. He is now facing six charges, the most severe of which carries a life sentence

Warning signs: Messer posted this montage on his Flickr page clearly setting out how smitten he was

Secret: Messer posted this picture of Emily on his Instagram account under #agapetos, which means 'beloved' in Greek

The Lieutenant said the charges
reflected the true severity of the crime and Messer's alleged betrayal of the 
family. 

Emily's mother, stepfather, Neil Schwartz, and five siblings 
were thrown into a panic of fear and uncertainty from the moment she 
went missing on Sunday morning to the moment of her discovery in a field
in Michigan on Tuesday afternoon.

Both she and Messer were badly 
dehydrated and taken to separate hospitals where they received treatment
for this and for 'superficial self-inflicted wounds.'

Emily remained in hospital 
yesterday but Messer was taken into police custody and is now in Wayne 
County Jail. Bail has been set at $2million.

Lieutenant Lauria said: 'The public need to know this guy groomed her for years. She's in love with the guy. It's very sad.'

Yesterday he said he was not authorized to comment on whether the wrist wounds found on both Emily and Messer were part of a suicide pact formed between the couple.

Emily's mother is still reeling from the shocking disappearance on Sunday - completely unaware just how close the Messer, a family friend, had apparently got to her daughter. 

But a search online shows that Messer at least was becoming increasingly brazen in his show of devotion. On his Instagram account two months ago he posted a picture of Emily with the caption: 'Looks like someone knows a secret'.

Found: Emily Lalinksy, pictured with Robert Messer, is staying in hospital for longer after they were found suffering from identical 'self-inflicted' wrist wounds

And alongside a picture of Emily posted three weeks ago in his account he wrote ‘agapetos’ a Greek word for ‘beloved.’

And
on his Flickr page he produced a montage of pictures of Emily with the 
worrying caption: 'We have known each other for many days... but every 
day with you has been a great day'.

On Tuesday Emily’s family spoke of their relief and delight that the teenager had been found.

Asked
by text whether she was pleased to have her daughter home, Emily’s 
mother, Lisa Schwartz replied simply: ‘You betcha.’ She summed up the 
ordeal as ‘every parent’s nightmare.’ 

Emily and Messer were found in a field in Washtenaw County, near 7 Mile and Chubbs Road in Northville. 

Their discovery brought to an end a search that began when Emily vanished from her home in Plymouth Township five days ago.

During that time police had feared for her safety. Emily's mother had made public appeals for her safe return on television, during which she admitted: ‘I think once Bob realizes what he has done he might hurt himself and I don’t know where that would leave her.’

Speaking yesterday from the family home in a quiet Plymouth neighborhood Lisa’s husband, Neil said: ‘Lisa’s priority now is Emily and looking after her.’

Distress: Emily's mother, Lisa, and her new husband, Neil Schwartz, are delighted she is back home.

Explanation: They left behind a letter explaining why they had run away and apologizing to their families

Desperate search: Police had been appealing to the public for help and received a number of tips that may have led them to the couple's hiding place

Both
Messer and the teenager left notes professing their love for each 
other, with Emily asking her mother to try not to blame herself.

Messer, recently divorced and father to a son, wrote: ‘We are in love and cannot be apart from each other.

‘This is sad to us but our love, though we’ve had to keep it a secret, has been the best part of our lives. Please be happy for us.’

In a heartfelt note to her mother, Emily wrote: ‘You are an amazing and wonderful mother and person. I’m so sorry I hurt you and if there was any other way we would’ve done it.

‘Try not to be sad and don’t blame yourself, nothing could be done.’

Messer had become a friend of Emily’s mother when they met at church. ‘I trusted him,’ Schwartz told ABC7 at the height of her search for her daughter.

‘My whole family trusted him. My daughter trusted him. Bob was always like a brother to me.

‘Emily doesn’t have a dad, so she always looked up to Bob as a dad, as a father figure. They’re both very introverted. They both love photography and they both love hiking.’

She said that far from feeling concern at Messer’s involvement in her teenage daughter’s life she had been grateful for the time he spent with her.

She said: ‘With me having so many kids I could not just take her and do things with her, so he was like, “I’ll take her to Ann Arbor, I’ll take her to the Botanical Gardens.’
