The blood and gore of the Syrian war zone has not stopped one rebel’s striking, photogenic appearance becoming an online sensation.

If anything, the nonchalant stride and sculpted physique of this Syrian freedom fighter seems even more astonishing considering the worsening conflict raging around him and across the country.

The photo of an unidentified fighter, complete with RPG casually resting on his shoulder, taken by Khalil Hamra near Idlib in Syria on June 15 has gone viral in an internet meme.

Fans have captioned: ‘Doesn't need an RPG...to knock your socks off.’

Another reads: ‘The most deadly missile in Syria… is not the one on my shoulder.’

Appreciative captioning: Fans find the lighter side of civil war, writing comedic captions for the rebel's photo

The ‘ridiculously photogenic’ Syrian soldier is now rivalling other viral photo memes such as Zeddie Little, the marathon runner from South Carolina and a bounding orange puppy that captured the hearts of an online audience worldwide.

While the U.N. accuses rebels and government forces of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity, people have found a lighter side to the conflict thanks to a good-looking rebel with a close-cropped hair cut, steely eyes and a saunter through the war zone.

How does he do it? Fans have commented on his surprisingly clean cut and chiseled features asking 'how can he be in the middle of a civil war and have hair like that?'

On Reddit Pics one user commented: 'Seriously, how can he be in the middle of a civil war and have hair like that?'

Another wrote: 'Sometimes you just need to look good. If you're going to face death, might as well look snappy as hell.'

Mr Little, 25, received international attention after a photograph of him while running in the 10km Cooper Bridge run in Charleston became an instant internet meme.
