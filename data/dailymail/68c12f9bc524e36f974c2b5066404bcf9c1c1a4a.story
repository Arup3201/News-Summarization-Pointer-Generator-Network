She's no stranger to running headlong into trouble, and it seems for Sally Bercow that her next venture will be no different.

The wife of House of Commons Speaker John Bercow has been pictured falling face first into snow while training for the new series of reality television show, The Jump.

The mother-of-three can be seen grimacing and flailing as she careers down the run at a North London ski school, before tumbling over on the slope.

As part of the series, hosted by Davina McCall and Alex Brooker, she will compete alongside 12 other celebrities in a range of winter sports including skeleton racing, bobsledding, speed skating and skiing.

Her appearance on the Channel 4 programme, which begins in January, may trouble her MP husband who has been humiliated by her previous gaffes in the media.

The 45-year-old faced legal action in 2012 after mistakenly linking Lord McAlpine to allegations of sex offences on Twitter.

And following her brief stint on Celebrity Big Brother in 2011, the Speaker was left red-faced after Mrs Bercow described their ‘spicy’ sex life.

She was the first contestant voted out by the public in Big Brother, but maintained that she stood by her appearance and was ‘very proud’ after raising £100,000 for AaA, the autism charity of which she and her husband are parent patrons.

Anyone fancy a holiday? The mother-of-three takes a break

One of their three children, seven-year-old son Oliver, is autistic.

Also set to appear on The Jump, which will be filmed in Innsbruck, Austria, is 36-year-old retired England rugby player, Mike Tindall, husband of Zara Phillips. 

It is believed the Yorkshire-born centre had to get permission from the Queen to take part.

Strictly Come Dancing star Ola Jordan had also been due to take part in the series, but broke her leg during training, meaning she missed the Strictly finale and will be unable to participate in the Channel 4 show.
