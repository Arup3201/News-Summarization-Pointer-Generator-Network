Women cyclists should have slow lanes to ‘pootle along’ in to stop them being intimidated by lycra-clad men tearing through towns and cities, a former Labour minister has claimed.

Meg Hillier said women do not want the ‘muck sweat’ of cycling and fear they will fall off their bike when other cyclists are ‘whizzing past you’.

Each year women cycle around 20 miles each, compared to 80 miles for men, latest figures show.

Women struggle to know what to wear when cycling to work and are put off by people lycra speeding past them, Labour MP Meg Hillier suggested

Ms Hillier, a Home Office minister in Gordon Brown’s government, called for roads to be redesigned to encourage more women to cycle.

She suggested there should be ‘a fast and a slow lane’ to separate the hardcore speed freaks from those who find the extreme pace ‘quite scary’.

The MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch also called for ‘cycling friendly fashion’.

New cycling data from the Department for Transport show marked differences between the sexes.

Women in their twenties are most likely to cycle, covering 53miles every year, but still well behind the 84 miles covered by men of the same age.

Forty-something men cyclist most, racking up 161miles compared to just 24miles for women aged 40-49.

Ms Hillier told the Telegraph: ‘One of the big things is also that women don’t want the “muck sweat” of cycling. There are some fashion designers around Hackney and east London now which are designing cycling friendly fashion, but not enough yet.

‘Men arrive at work in flat shoes and a suit if you are going to an office job and so it is easier to turn up on a bike – for a women there is the worry of wearing a skirt, or a dress, maybe high heels, then you have to think about something else to wear on your bike, how to carry your work clothes. Although there are plenty of women who hop on and go.’

She said cycle planners had to consider how to mark cycling ‘a normal thing’.

‘I think Hackney has tried to pioneer that where you can cycle down a normal road, and you are not forced down rat runs and with the lycra-clad mad cyclists.

‘It can be quite scary with all these people whizzing past you and you are afraid you are going to fall over.

‘When cycling is planned ideally, you have a fast and a slow lane, so those that want to pootle along at a normal pace can do so.’

In the last decade the number of miles cycled by men has soared from 57 to 80miles, a 40 per cent rise.

But among women it has risen from 18 to 20, an increase of only 11 per cent.

Among the under-60s, women walk further than men. Overall, men of all ages walk 80 miles a year to women’s 193miles.
