A Sainsbury's poster urging staff to encourage customers to spend more money in the supermarket was accidentally placed on the front window of a store, making it visible to passers-by.

The sign - which urged staff to try to make shoppers ‘spend an additional 50p during each shopping trip’ - was spotted by TV freelancer Chris Dodd outside the store in Stratford, east London.

He posted a photograph of the sign on Twitter and it has since been retweeted more than 2,500 times, with Sainsbury's confirming that the poster was ‘intended for colleague areas in the store’.

The sign - with pictures of a purse and 50p coin - said: ‘Fifty pence challenge: Let’s encourage every customer to spend an additional 50p during each shopping trip between now and the year-end.’

Mr Dodd tweeted Sainsbury's last night, saying: ‘Not sure this is supposed to be in your window’, before an employee replied: ‘Yeah, I don't think so either. Which store was this? I'll give them a call.’

But responding to the worker - who identified himself as ‘Ross’ - Mr Dodd then said: ‘Oh I'm not sure about that, Ross... I kinda (sic) like that they're giving folks a heads up!’

Ross replied: ‘Understood. I'd really appreciate you letting me know which store though.’

Mr Dodd, enjoying the discussion, went on to ask Ross a further question and decided to create his own hashtag: ‘How are staff supposed to encourage the extra 50p spend? #50pChallenge.’

But Ross replied: ‘This is clearly a poster meant for staff areas. I'd really like to make sure it gets to where it should be.’

This morning, following the picture going viral on Twtitter, Mr Dodd said: 'Astonished by all the RT's (retweets) of #50pChallenge - I think I now qualify to go on Celeb Big Brother - so that's a bonus.'

A Sainsbury’s spokesman told MailOnline today: ‘We often use posters to make store targets fun and achievable for our colleagues.

‘They are intended for colleague areas in the store, but this one was mistakenly put on public display.’
