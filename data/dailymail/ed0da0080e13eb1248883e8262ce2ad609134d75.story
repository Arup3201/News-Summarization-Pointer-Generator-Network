At the age of 18 he was mistaken for a baby and labelled a circus freak, but 3ft tall Azad Singh has achieved his dreams of becoming a teacher - the world's smallest to be precise.

Mr Singh has a rare genetic disorder which meant he stopped growing at the age of five and at the age of 22 is trapped in a child's body.

He teaches computer skills at an all-girls school in Haryana, India, where his teenage students tower over him.

A rare hormone disorder stopped Azad Singh from growing at the age of five and now he wears children's clothes

Pupils aged 12 call their teacher Azad Singh 'Chotu' meaning 'Little Sir' because he is just 3ft tall

To address his pupils, Mr Singh stands on a table so that he is high enough to reach the whiteboard.

Because he measures just 3ft tall and weighs 2st 13lbs his pupils affectionately call him 'Chotu' which means 'Little Sir'.

Mr Singh, who earns 10,000 rupees a month (Â£120) and has to wear clothes designed for seven-year-olds says the nickname doesn't bother him.

'I don't mind, I've achieved what I always wanted. People treat me differently now I have a job - with some respect,' he told The Sun.

At the age of 18 a train guard embarrassed Mr Sing by mistaking him for a baby. At school he was bullied because of his size, and became so terrified by threats that he would be kidnapped by a circus he was afraid to go out.

But he said the childhood taunts were character building and led him to where he is today. Mr Singh added: 'Bullies have made me strive hard to achieve my goals.'

His 19-year-old sister, Laxmi, also has the same disorder, but their parents could not afford the hormone injections necessary to encourage growth.

His youngest sister Suman is 15 and attends the secondary school where he teaches in Gurgaon, Badshapur and drives him to work every day on her moped.

She said: 'He has made me very proud.'

Mr Singh's mother Parvati, 52, said: 'He has finally found happiness.'
