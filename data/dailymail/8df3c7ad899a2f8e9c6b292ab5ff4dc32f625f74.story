A builder today unveiled Britain's most luxurious treehouse, which cost £60,000 to make and comes complete with log burner, 60-inch plasma TV and even a hot tub.

Chris Whalley created the incredible hideaway in Blean, Kent, over seven months, crafting it almost entirely from driftwood gathered from a nearby beach.

The holiday home has plumbing and electricity and comes with all the creature comforts of a five-star hotel, with a rustic decor that works in harmony with its natural setting.

Reaching for the sky: Chris Whalley with his luxury Treehouse Hideaway, which he has spent £60,000 on building over seven months

Rustic look: The businessman used scrap wood 
from a builders' merchants and driftwood from Whitstable beach to 
construct the home

Stylish living: The cabin promises the finest Egyptian cotton linen, Waters and Noble bathrobes and towels and top of the range kitchen crockery

Handcrafted: Some pieces of furniture in the house are worth more than £1,500 each

Bathing in style: An elevated hot tub backs up Mr Walley's claim that this is the most deluxe treehouse in Britain

Entrancing: The jacuzzi is the ultimate luxury additions to the magical space

The impressive construction sits a staggering 20ft above the ground, making it the tallest habitable tre house in Britain - and the most deluxe.

Talented Mr Whalley, who runs a holiday letting business, started designing his high-tech treehouse on a computer in March this year.

To keep costs down, he used scraps of wood from a builders' merchant and piles of driftwood collected from nearby Whitstable beach.

He built the cabin largely without the help of any scaffolding, by shimmying up and down the tree with ropes.

Mr Whalley and wife Michelle, 48, who have six children, also salvaged enough scrap materials to build cupboards, a table and bed.

The finished product now proudly sits around a 25ft red cedar tree among the holiday log cabins Mr and Mrs Whalley built six years ago.

Stunning view: The hideaway is the tallest habitable treehouse in Britain at 20ft from the ground

Resourceful: The grandfather of four shimmied up and down ropes to build the luxury getaway from builders' scrap wood and driftwood from Whitstable beach

Inspired: The businessman came up with the idea when a little girl staying in one of his log cabins tried to climb a tree

Almost every feature in the house, including the tree trunk sink and the concrete wood-effect kitchen worktop are one of a kind bespoke items worth more than £1,500.

The cabin promises the finest Egyptian cotton linen, Waters and Noble bath robes and towels and top of the range kitchen crockery.

The grandfather of four revealed he was inspired to build the luxury home after a little girl on holiday in one of his lets nagged him for a tree house.

He said: 'One night me and Michelle were staying in the log cabin, and sat in the hot tub with a glass of wine and I said "I'm bored" - I needed something to do.

'I said I wanted to build a treehouse at the top of the garden and that was it.

'I built it from scratch. It was a bit ambitious and I'm glad it's over - it's half-killed me.

'There are several treehouses in Britain, but none that are habitable.

'People often have to go abroad to France if they want to stay in one. We have had nothing but good responses so far.'

Mr Whalley first had the idea for his tree house two years ago when a family with young children came to stay in one of his log cabins.

One of the young girls was trying to climb the tree and Mr Whalley told her it wasn't safe, but if she came back next year he would build her a treehouse.

Last year, the holidaymakers returned to the log cabin and it had a children's treehouse for their youngsters to play in.

Inspired, Mr Whalley then decided he could do more with the sturdy tree and started his luxury project.

The couple's dreams were almost dashed before they got off the ground after Blean Parish Council received several complaints and objections.

But the couple took the objections on board before the application was sent to Canterbury City Council planning committee.

The couple were then given the go ahead for their luxury holiday let in October 2011 and began building in March 2012.

The treehouse, which overlooks animal enclosures at Druidstone Wildlife park near Canterbury was completed in October.

Mr Whalley said: 'Everyone who returned to the site said they loved the children's tree house and it was a pity that they couldn't stay in there.

Bookings are now taking being taken with customers from as far away as Australia and the U.S. branching out for the added luxury.

The treehouse, is available for between £150 and £200 a night, has already scored an impressive five-star score on its TripAdvisor reviews.
