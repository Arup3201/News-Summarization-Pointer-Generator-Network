Bids: Dan Allam with the leftover sprouts that sold on eBay for £100

A magician who sold two leftover Brussels sprouts from his Christmas dinner on eBay raised £100 for charity.

Dan Allam, 21, decided to put the sprouts on the auction site after finishing the rest of his meal on Christmas Day, to prove his claim in a family debate that you could find a buyer for 'anything' on it.

But he was stunned when, after uploading a photo of the sprouts, he began receiving dozens of messages from prospective buyers.

The organic sprouts, handpicked from Dan’s garden in Ledbury, Herefordshire, on Christmas Eve, have been kept fresh in iced water.

Some 22 bidders pledged cash for the sprouts and more than 850 eBay sellers keeping tabs on the auction.

The winning bid was £99.99 and will be donated to the Make A Wish Foundation, which grants wishes to children and young people fighting life-threatening conditions.

Mr Allam said he came up with the idea at Christmas lunch with his parents Nigel, 47, Michele, 44, sister Tori, 22 and grandfather John Allam, 89.

He said: ‘It is my grandfather’s tradition to wait until after lunch before opening the presents and we always discuss what we think we have during the meal.

‘My sister admitted she had sold a hideous jumper she had received on eBay and I said, "Well, you can sell anything on there these days."

‘Then I looked down at my plate and there were these two unwanted sprouts left. I got my phone out and took a picture of them, before uploading it to eBay.

‘Within an hour I had received 15 emails and then it just escalated. I thought I would only raise £1 but the bids are now at £100. It is great for the charity.’

Mr Allam has received poems and messages of support as well as questions about how the sprouts will taste and whether they are suitable for vegetarians.

He has even measured the sprouts after questioning from eBay users. The larger has a diameter of 2.27cm while the smaller has one of 1.92cm.

Dan, who has the username majik_dan on eBay, added: ‘It is one of the most bizarre things I have ever done.’
