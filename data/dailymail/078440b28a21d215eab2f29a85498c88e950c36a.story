A Maine nurse who successfully fought the state's quarantine for health care workers who have treated Ebola patients today claimed the guidelines were driven by an 'abundance of politics'.

Speaking on NBC News' 'Meet The Press', Kaci Hickox, who tested negative for the deadly virus earlier this week, condemned New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's policy toward such workers.

'When Christie stated it was an abundance of caution, which is his reasoning for putting health care workers in a sort of quarantine for three weeks, it was really an abundance of politics,' she said.

The 33- year-old, who lives in Fort Kent with her boyfriend, Ted Wilbur, added: 'And I think all of the scientific and medical and public health community agrees with me on that statement.

'We know a lot about Ebola. We know that it's not transmitted from someone who is asymptomatic, as I am and many other aid workers will be when they return.'

However, in a separate interview, Miss Hickox said she will respect the wishes of Fort Kent locals and avoid going into the town until November 10, the end of the disease's 21-day incubation period.

Miss Hickox was placed in an isolation tent in New Jersey a week ago after returning from treating critically-ill Ebola victims in Sierra Leone, West Africa.

She was eventually allowed to leave for Maine, where she was placed under what authorities called a 'voluntary quarantine' for three weeks.

But in subsequent days, Miss Hickox went against the guidelines by going cycling with Mr Wilbur and having a pepperoni and mushroom pizza delivered to their home.

Her defiance of the quarantine drove the Governor of Maine, Paul LePage, to threaten to arrest the nurse, telling members of the press: 'I don't want her within three feet of anyone.'

Governor: Speaking on NBC News' 'Meet The Press', the 33-year-old, who tested negative for Ebola earlier this week, condemned New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's (pictured) policy toward returning health workers

Last Thursday, Miss Hickox was ordered by Charles LaVerdiere, chief judge of Maine District Court, to remain at least three feet from anyone, avoid public places and stay in Fort Kent for 24 hours.

The legal action was dubbed the nation's biggest test case yet in the struggle to balance public health and fear of Ebola against personal freedom.

But one day later, Judge LaVerdiere lifted the restrictions, ruling that Miss Hickox can venture wherever she pleases because she has no symptoms of Ebola and is therefore not contagious.

However, she must undergo daily monitoring of her health, notify health authorities if she travels and inform officials if she develops any symptoms, including vomiting, a rash and bleeding from the eyes.

Defiance: After returning to Maine, Miss Hickox was placed under what authorities called a 'voluntary quarantine' for 21 days, the disease's incubation period. But in subsequent days, she went against the guidelines by going cycling with her boyfriend, Ted Wilbur, and having a  pizza delivered to their home

Since her return to America last week, Miss Hickox, has maintained the quarantine violates her human rights, claiming she poses no risk to the public.

After arriving home from the one-hour bike ride last Thursday, she said: 'There is no court action against me. There is nothing to stop me from going for a bike ride in my home town.'

The strict quarantines for returning health care workers, implemented by states like Maine as well as the U.S. Army, are going above and beyond the CDC guidelines. 

Mr Christie has defended his decision to impose a mandatory three-week quarantine in New Jersey, saying that counting on a voluntary system may or may not work and that protecting health and safety is the government's job.

Joyful: The nurse said she had no option but to challenge how medical professionals were being treated

However, in her later interview, Miss Hickox today said she had no option but to challenge how medical professionals were being treated.

She told the Maine Sunday Telegram she was fighting for the rights of other U.S. medical workers who are trying to bring the deadly outbreak under control in West Africa. 

'I hope in six months aid workers returning back can be unnoticed,' she told the newspaper. 'They won't be in the media like I was, I hope. 

'And they can walk into a grocery store and maybe no one even knows they were working in a country with Ebola, but one day I hope everyone can know and still smile at them in the grocery store. I know that won't happen today.'

Threat: Miss Hickox's defiance of her quarantine drove the Governor of Maine, Paul LePage (pictured), to threaten to arrest the nurse, telling members of the press: 'I don't want her within three feet of anyone'

She added that she will refrain from venturing out into her hometown until November 10 out of respect for the area's other 4,000 residents.

'I didn't mean to bring this media storm onto this community, either, but I think unfortunately sometimes, especially when up against governors, you don't always have an option,' she said. 

 Hickox, originally from Rio Vista, Texas, worked in Indonesia, Burma, the Darfur region of Sudan and Nigeria, before returning to the U.S. to earn masters' degrees in public health and nursing.

She went to Sierra Leone this summer with Doctors Without Borders when the Ebola outbreak erupted.

She told the paper that she didn't count the number of people who died, only the number of survivors: 39 during her time. But she still remembers the victims.

On her last night in the country, she treated a little girl who didn't survive.

'I don't remember her exact age. I think she was 10, but to watch a 10-year-old die alone, in a tent and know there wasn't anything you could do, it's hard,' she said.

President Barack Obama, the nation's top infectious-disease expert and humanitarian groups have warned that overly restrictive measures could cripple the fight against the disease at its source.

They claim such measures could discourage volunteers like Miss Hickox from going to West Africa, where the outbreak has sickened more than 13,000 people and killed nearly 5,000 of them.

'These kinds of restrictions could dissuade hundreds, if not thousands, of skilled volunteers from helping stop Ebola's spread, which is in the national interest of every one of our countries,' Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Thursday in Brussels.

U.S. public concern about Ebola is high, even though only one person in the country is currently being treated for it, a New York doctor, Craig Spencer, who cared for patients in West Africa.

Spencer, 33, was in a stable condition - upgraded from serious - on Saturday, New York's Bellevue Hospital said.
