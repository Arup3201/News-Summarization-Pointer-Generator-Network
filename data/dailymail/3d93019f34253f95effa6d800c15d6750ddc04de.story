An elderly driver backed into his wife, then ran over himself when he scrambled out to help her.

George
 Yada, 87, and his 80-year-old wife Setsuko were killed on their 
own driveway in the El Cerrito neighbourhood of San Diego, California.

The
 San Diego County Medical Examiner said Mrs Yada was hit by her 
husband's pickup truck as he tried to park it outside their home.

Panicking, Mr Yada fell 
out of the truck as he rushed to see if his wife was okay. The truck was
 still moving and it rolled over Mr Yada, pinning him against their 
house.

Paramedics declared Mrs Yada dead at the scene. Mr Yada was taken to hospital, but was pronounced dead soon after.

Steve Hashiguchi, the couple's nephew, choked back tears as he told NBC San Diego the couple were like his 'second parents'.

Mr
 Yada, a dementia sufferer, had been trying to reposition his truck 
which was caught on a kerb outside his West Overlook home just after 9pm
 on Sunday.

'My uncle, who was really too old to be driving decided he was going to back the pickup into the driveway,' said Mr Hasiguchi.

'And it seems that my aunt was standing beside him with the driver's door open, trying to get him out of the car.'

The
 truck popped the kerb suddenly, slamming into Mrs Yada. Mr Yada leapt 
out to help, but he was caught beneath its wheels as it rolled 
backwards.

The couple had 
been married for 45 years. Yesterday, neighbours placed flowers on the 
car that killed them, which is still sitting on their driveway.
