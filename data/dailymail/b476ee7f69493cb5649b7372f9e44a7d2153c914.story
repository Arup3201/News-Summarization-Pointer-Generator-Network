This is the moment when a father 
thought he was seeing his son die as a hot air balloon burst into flames
after hitting 132,000-volt power cables.

Watching from another balloon, Martin Griffiths feared the worst as 18-year-old Adam drifted into the overhead lines.

As he landed in a nearby field, Mr Griffiths, 42, heard bolts of electricity blasting through the canopy of his son’s craft.

Hit: This is the dramatic moment the balloon crashed into the cables and was set alight, caught on camera by bystander Rachel Smith at about 6pm on Sunday

Drama: Three teenagers were left suspended 15 metres above the ground as they waited for the overhead cables to be turned off

Then the small basket under the balloon containing Adam and his two companions was set ablaze by showers of sparks.

Convinced that Adam had been killed, Mr Griffiths sprinted back to the scene.

He added: ‘I had landed a couple of 
fields along when I heard the bang. I thought Adam was dead. The basket 
was on fire and he was stuck in the cables.’

As the passengers, Colin Giggle and a 
girl aged 16 who has not been named, cowered in the bottom of the 
9ft-square basket, Adam doused the flames with a fire extinguisher. Adam
was unhurt, Mr Giggle suffered a burned shoulder and the teenager’s 
hair was singed.

Terrifying accident: Pilot Adam Griffiths, 18, suffered burns when he and two teenage passengers crashed into an electricity pylon, absorbing 132,000 volts

Then, after their brush with death, 
the passengers – who had not been in a hot air balloon before – and 
their pilot played I-spy as they dangled 45ft off the ground for five 
hours waiting for the power to be switched off so they could be brought 
down by rescue teams.

Mr Giggle, 52, said they had to ‘curl 
up like hedgehogs’ as they smashed into the wires, adding: ‘It was like 
being inside a firework. There were a lot of sparks.

‘This sort of thing kills people – we were very lucky to walk away from the scene.

‘As we dropped below the wires we were
waiting for contact, thinking it would cause a spark. When the wires 
twanged on the basket we did think, “This will hurt”.

‘The experience definitely used up one of my nine lives.’

Adam and his father were in two of six
balloons that had taken off together from a field at Riseley, 
Bedfordshire, on Sunday afternoon. They had travelled about ten miles 
when a gust blew Adam into pylons near Bozeat, Northamptonshire, just 
before 6pm.

Adam, from Rushden, Northamptonshire, said: ‘I did panic after hitting the wires.

‘There was quite a bang when we hit the power lines, and then I saw there was a fire in the basket.

‘It is all a bit of a blur really, but it was scary.

‘You go through all these things in 
your training but it still doesn’t come into play until it actually 
happens.’ And he added: ‘It won’t put me off flying balloons. I’ve been 
doing it since I was a baby.’

Rescue: Emergency services had to wait until 11pm for the power to be turned off so they could get to the hot air balloon

Mr Giggle, himself an amateur 
aeroplane pilot, said the waistcoat he had been wearing was ‘full of 
holes on the back’ from where he was hit by ‘little gobbets of fire’.

He added that the trio passed the time
with games as they waited for rescue. The marketing data manager said: 
‘We played I-spy. But after we had “g” for “grass” and “p” for “pylon” 
we didn’t have many more ideas.

‘The wind picked up and the basket was
moving to and fro, but there was nothing we could do. We did get very 
cold, but you just cope.’

When they were rescued at 11pm, each of them was harnessed to a fireman who abseiled down the pylon.

Hanging: The three passengers had to put out a fire started on impact with the pylon

Danger: Pilot Adam Griffiths and two others were forced to cower in the basket for five hours while waiting for the electricity to be turned off

The incident is being investigated by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch.

However, Mr Griffiths believes a sudden change in wind direction caused the ‘freak accident’.

He said the £25,000 Cameron N-77 
balloon had been destroyed in the accident, but added: ‘I’m just so glad
Adam’s all right. It could have been so much worse.’

Despite his ordeal, Mr Giggle is 
determined to have another flight, joking: ‘I will be going up in a 
balloon again as I want to experience a normal landing.’

Blocked: Police diverted traffic away from the scene as the trio were trapped above ground for five hours
