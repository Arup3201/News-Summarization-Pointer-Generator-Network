A mother and father, one of whom inflicted 'extremely distressing' injuries on their newborn baby, have walked free from court, because it cannot be proved which of them was responsible.

Either Craig Howse or Toni Wilkinson, both 27, left their son with a fractured skull, fractured ribs and other disturbing injuries when he was just three weeks old.

The two, both from Newburn, Newcastle, admitted a cruelty charge on the basis of not getting earlier medical treatment for one of the injuries.

Either Toni Wilkinson or Craig Howse, both 27, from Newburn, Newcastle, inflicted horrific injuries on their three-week old child - but neither can be sentenced for the crime because prosecutors cannot be sure which one is responsible

But Newcastle Crown Court heard it could not be proved which one inflicted the injuries - and he could not sentence either parent for the injuries, purely on the basis that someone 'ought to pay'.

Sentencing the pair, Judge Robert Adams said he hoped the perpetrator felt 'shame and regret' which was 'deeply felt and long term'.

For the cruelty charge, he sentenced them both to a four-month jail term, suspended for 18 months, but said it would not be in the 'public interest' to send them to jail.

The court heard the baby was found with a catalogue of injuries on March 21 by medics last year.

The
 little boy had a tear to the flesh in his mouth and skull and rib 
fractures, possibly caused when he was squeezed and or dropped.

The judge said: 'The photographs of the injuries suffered by the child and the description of the non-accidental injuries are extremely distressing and would be extremely distressing to anyone.

'Neither of you are to be sentenced for causing or inflicting any injury nor allowing any injury to occur.

'The perpetrator knows who he or she is and I hope that shame and regret in that person, whoever that person is, is deeply felt and long term.

'I cannot sentence either of you on the basis someone ought to pay for those terrible, non-accidental injuries.'

The judge made it clear that one of the pair was responsible for the injuries to the boy.

He said: 'Both of you are the parents of the boy, who at three weeks of age had sustained a number of inflicted injuries at the hands of one or other of you.

'He suffered serious physical harm while in the care of the pair of you. The prosecution cannot say which of you two inflicted any injuries or even that many of the injuries would have been evident to the non-perpetrator parent.

'Whatever people’s views about the injuries suffered are concerned, which are clearly extremely unpleasant, you are to be sentenced only for failure to seek medical attention at an appropriate time in respect of a single injury, without knowledge of how the injury occurred.'

'The perpetrator knows who he or she is 
and I hope that shame and regret in that person, whoever that person is,
 is deeply felt and long term'

Judge Robert Adams

The judge said the prison sentences could be suspended because there was 'absolutely no public interest' in sending either defendant to custody for a short time.

Judge Adams added: 'The time you actually served would be extremely short and no doubt would be extremely difficult for both of you, in the light of the type of offences for which you fall to be sentenced.'

The judge said that at the forefront of his mind while passing sentence was the 'burden and standard of proof' required in criminal cases.

During the case, prosecutor Miss Clemitson told the court: 'He was three weeks of age and had, by that stage, sustained a number of inflicted injuries at the hands of one or other of these two defendants.

'He suffered serious physical harm while in the care of his parents between the three week period between birth and admission to hospital on March 21 last year.'

Tom Finch, for Howse, said: 'He has shown remorse.'

Anne Richardson, for Wilkinson, said: 'She has been devastated by the proceedings. Just hearing the word cruelty put her in floods of tears.'
