Bahrain deported a U.S. citizen working as a teacher in the gulf kingdom over what it described Saturday as her 'radical' writings online as the government cracks down on dissent in the country.

Erin Kilbride, of Portland, Maine, left the kingdom and was to arrive back in the U.S. later Saturday, officials at the Bahrain Center for Human Rights said.

The Georgetown University graduate recently wrote an editorial criticizing the Bahraini leadership that was posted to Muftah.org, a news website, on July 8.

The editorial accused Bahrain's King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa of being 
hypocritical for supporting the recent overthrow of Egyptian President 
Mohammed Morsi while cracking down on political dissenters within his own 
borders, the Portland Press Herald reported.

Bahrain's Ministry of State for Communications said it had received complaints about Kilbride

'Bahrain's own king 
has been at the helm of a two-and-a-half-year crackdown on protesters in
the island nation, a movement led by Bahrain's majority Shiite 
population,' she wrote. 'The modus operandi in Bahrain has been less 
about affirming the 'aspirations of the people' than about silencing 
popular demands via imprisonment of activists and strict bans on rallies
calling for political reforms and equal rights.'

In a statement Saturday, Bahrain's 
Ministry of State for Communications said it had received complaints 
about Kilbride, who is in her mid-20s. The ministry said an 
investigation found that Kilbride worked 'illegally as an unaccredited 
journalist' in violation of her visa.

Kilbride was 'using Twitter and a number
of websites to publish articles on Bahrain that were deemed to incite 
hatred against the government and members of the royal family,' the 
ministry said. It did not offer specifics about what she wrote, though 
it did say she wrote for the Bahrain Center for Human Rights.

The ministry also said her landlord apparently reported Kilbride for having a flag of Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim political party and militant group in Lebanon. The official Twitter feed of Bahrain's Minister of State Communications, Fawaz Al Khalifa, posted images Saturday that it described as a yellow Hezbollah flag in Kilbride's bedroom.

Kilbride did not return requests for comment Monday.

Her LinkedIn profile shows she has 
worked for a number of human rights organizations, including Ayenda 
Foundation, which promotes the rights of women and children in 
Afghanistan.

Bahrain, home to the U.S. Navy's 5th fleet, has faced months of unrest between the Sunni-led monarchy and its majority Shiite population. Bahrain's king, who has 12 children with four wives has been in power since 2002.

The government has started a crackdown on dissent, including the parliament approving tougher measures against so-called 'terrorists' that give authorities greater ability to strip citizenship from people convicted of violence.

On Friday, British Airways barred Maryam al-Khawaja, the acting president of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, from boarding a direct London-to-Bahrain flight over what a spokesman described as a request from the government. Al-Khawaja is the daughter of jailed activist Abdulhadi al-Khawaja.
