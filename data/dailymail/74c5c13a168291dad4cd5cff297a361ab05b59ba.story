A British baby has been taken into emergency care in Portugal as police probe claims her parents were ‘drunk and disorderly’.

The pair allegedly threw their 14-month-old girl into a hotel swimming pool in front of horrified holidaymakers at their Algarve resort.

The mother was also seen staggering around with the little girl in her arms on the eighth-floor balcony of their hotel room, it was claimed.

The couple were staying at four-star Hotel Paraiso (pictured) in Albuferia when staff called police after they allegedly threw their 14-month-old baby daughter in the swimming pool

Police were called by concerned hotel staff, and they discovered unexplained bruises on the child’s body, according to local reports.

Yesterday prosecutors were questioning the couple while their baby was being cared for at a children’s hospital in the regional capital Faro.

The latest drama unfolded on Sunday evening at the four-star Hotel Paraíso, which describes itself as ‘one of the most charismatic and well-known hotels on the Algarve’.

A police spokesman said: ‘We were called to a tourist resort where a foreign couple were drunk with a baby child and causing a disturbance.’

Last night a hotel worker claimed: ‘The couple were drunk and the child was thrown into the pool and was in danger. She was taken to hospital.’

Newspaper Jornal de Notícias claimed the mother was drunk with her baby on the balcony of the family’s eighth-floor room.

A witness told the paper: ‘It was a tremendous fright, seeing the mum bumping into the walls with the baby in her arms, falling to the ground, getting up and falling again.

‘I thought the little girl would fall over the balcony.’

The girl was taken into the care of social services in the regional capital of Faro, while her parents were questioned by police in Albuferia

Portuguese newspaper Diario de Noticias claimed: ‘The couple threw the baby into the pool, causing enormous concern to hotel guests having dinner nearby.’

When police were called, the father allegedly ‘tried to fight’ with officers, according to local reports.

The couple were not arrested, but face two separate investigations, one by the Albufeira Judicial Court into the alleged behaviour of the father, and the other by the Family Court in Portimão to determine the welfare of the baby.

A hospital spokesman said later that the little girl was fine, with ‘no health problems’.

Yesterday, after being interviewed at Albufeira Court, her parents were allowed to visit their daughter in the hospital.

They had been coming to the end of a week-long holiday, but will now need the permission of the family court before being allowed to return to the UK.

They are believed to be from Belfast in Northern Ireland.

Initial reports in the Portuguese media that the baby had been ‘doped’ with sedatives were later dismissed when tests on the baby proved negative.

Last night the Foreign Office said: ‘We are aware of an incident involving a British couple and we are providing consular assistance.’
