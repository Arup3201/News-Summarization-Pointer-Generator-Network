A New York University professor who posted a message on Twitter suggesting that obese PhD students are not capable of completing the program has backtracked and claimed that his tweet was part of a research project.

Geoffrey Miller, who specializes in evolutionary psychology, tweeted on Sunday: 'Dear obese PhD applicants: If you don't 
have the willpower to stop eating carbs, you won't have the willpower to
 do a dissertation. #truth.'

It is understood that he will keep his job as a visiting professor at NYU's Stern School of Business.

Academic slip-up: Visiting NYU professor Geoffrey Miller caused outrage when he tweeted this message last month

Crass: The professor, who has tenure at the University of New Mexico, quickly apologized for his remarks

However, according to nymag.com, Miller's future may be uncertain at the University of New Mexico where he is a tenured professor. He reportedly claimed to his boss that the tweet was 'part of a research project'.

Professor Miller quickly deleted the message on Sunday after a 
backlash from students and professors alike.

Jay Rosen, who teaches journalism at the New York school, wrote: 'Astonishing fat-shaming tweet, since deleted, from an academic, @matingmind. The mind boggles.'

Miller's transgression brought into question the academic's impartiality when it came to picking students for highly competitive PhD programs.

Dr Jason DeCaro, a former PhD student who is now a biological anthropologist in Alabama, tweeted: 'Dear rejected UNM psychology applicants: save now-deleted tweet for potential lawsuit. Jerk.'

Miller posted a hasty apology: 'My sincere apologies to all for that idiotic, impulsive, and badly judged tweet. It does not reflect my true views, values, or standards.'

It was quickly followed by the 
remark: 'Obviously my previous tweet does not represent the selection 
policies of any university, or my own selection.'

MailOnline was awaiting a response from Professor Miller as to what criteria he uses to select PhD students.

Miller, who is a tenured professor at the University of New Mexico, has joined NYU's Stern School of Business for eight months until this August.

He has been published in a wide range of international academic publications and conducted research at the London School of Economics, the Max Planck Institute for Psychological Research in Munich, Germany and UCLA.

All apologies: The academic quickly retracted his offensive remark on June 2
