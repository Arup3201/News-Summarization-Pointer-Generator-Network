A formerly conjoined twin who was surgically separated from her sister in April has died.

A'zhari Jones died on Sunday night just days after celebrating her first birthday with her twin sister A'zhiah.

Doctors had been optimistic about the twins' chances after separation.

'At this point we don’t anticipate 
any future operations or need for any long term medications,' he 
said in a statement in April.

'I see the girls living full happy lives as individuals.'

A'zhari and A'zhiah Jones were
born connected at the chest with a shared a liver and pericardium - the
fluid-filled sac around the heart and major blood vessels.

They
underwent the first phase of their separation surgery in October, but 
due to ill-health the final part of the complex procedure was postponed 
until April. 

Joined: Ms Nachell was 12 weeks pregnant when she learned she was expecting twins and a week later scans revealed that the fetuses were conjoined

Team effort: More than 40 surgeons and pediatric specialists participated in the 14-hour surgery to separate the twins

The pair made a full recovery from 
the 14-hour treatment and doctors said there should be no need for 
future intervention or long-term medication.

The girls were born on October 10, 2012, through a planned cesarean section to Nachell Jones and Carlos Lawrence, of Franklin, Virginia. They weighed a combined 10 pounds.

Ms Nachell was 12 weeks 
pregnant when she learned she was expecting twins and a week later scans revealed that the fetuses were conjoined. 

In April, a team of 40 specialists and staff members led by Dr Lanning completed the final operation in the separation process.

Recovery: Doctors expected the twins to fully recover from their surgery, but tragically one has died

It was the second separation of conjoined twins performed at the Children’s Hospital of Richmond.

In November 2011, Dr Lanning and a large 
team of specialists successfully separated 19-month-old conjoined twins,
Maria and Teresa Tapia of the Dominican Republic, in a complex 20-hour 
procedure.

According to Dr Lanning, while phased-separation surgeries of twins conjoined at the head or hips have been successful, there are no published reports of successful, phased-separation surgeries of those sharing vital organs and conjoined at the abdomen and heart like the Jones girls.

It is as yet unknown whether the death of A'zhari Jones was caused by complications from the separation surgery.
