Oscar Wilde may have said ‘I can resist everything except temptation,' but he didn't have a smart safe to help him.

The cylindrical device, called kSafe, keeps various forms of temptation locked away - whether it is fattening cookies, cigarettes or a time-consuming games controller.

And the only way to unlock it is to reach pre-determined fitness goals, such as walking a set number of steps in a day.

No more temptation: The cylindrical device, called kSafe, locks up a form of temptation - whether it is fattening cookies, cigarettes or a time-consuming games controller (pictured)

The San Diego-based start-up behind the device said on its Kickstarter site: ‘kSafe is part of a research proven system that turns temptation into motivation, so you always achieve your goals.’

Users place an object of temptation into the safe and then set a goal using the accompanying app.

There are three types of goals to choose from including activity goals, location goals and time goals.

For example, for an activity goal, users could set the safe to unlock once they have taken a certain number of steps or burned enough calories, while a location goal may help motivate students.

Users will place temptation into the kSafe, whether that is a bar of chocolate or iPad, for example.

They will then set a goal using the smartphone app and lock the kSafe. 

There are three different types of choose from and the level of difficulty can be set - but not lessened once the safe has been locked.

The kSafe will only unlock once a user has reached their goal. 

Users will be able to follow their progress on a light-up button and app.

‘Set kSafe to only unlock once you've arrived and checked-in to a location, like a gym or library,' the company said.

The safe will be able to be instructed to open on certain days or at certain times, which the firm added can be used to break bad habits, such as snacking between meal times.

It claimed the safe ‘crams years of willpower and behavioural research from MIT, Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and Princeton in to a fun, effective, and easy to use product.’

It uses pre-commitment, an example of which is moving an alarm clock out of reach so the user can’t reach the snooze button, to make people commit to a smart choice, knowing that they'll probably be tempted later.

The device also capitalises on the idea of reward substitution, much like at school when a person may have worked hard on homework to earn going to a party.

‘Even though making your boss happy or acing a test has more long term benefits, it's wanting that beer with our friends that motivates us to finish,' the company wrote.

Motivational: Users will be able to view their progress in meeting their goal on the light-up ‘button dial’ on the top of the kSafe (pictured) or via the app

Compact: The safe can also be used in a conventional way using a password code to keep items safe, or off-limits to children, for example. This diagram shows its dimensions

‘Both of these concepts have been thoroughly researched and tested and they are consistently shown to improve our chances of reaching our goals.'

Users will be able to view their progress in meeting their goal on the light-up ‘button dial’ on the top of the safe or via the app. When they achieve their goal, the safe will pop open.

The company said: ‘kSafe won’t open until you’ve reached your goal. No overrides!’

The safe could also be used in a conventional way using a password code to keep items safe or off-limits to children, for example.

As well as allowing users to check their progress, the app will let them raise the bar if they are feeling particularly motivated to burn extra calories or study into the night.

But it won’t let users get away with making their challenge easier.

The device is available in three colours: black, white and transparent, and can be pre-ordered via Kickstarter for $89 (£60) with an estimated delivery date of November.
