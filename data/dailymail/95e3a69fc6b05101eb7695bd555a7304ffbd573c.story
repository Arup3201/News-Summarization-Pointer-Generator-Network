Charged: Kevin C. Matthews, pictured, is accused of sexually abusing a 3-year-old boy on a plane

Federal prosecutors in Utah have charged a man accused of sexually abusing a sleeping 3-year-old boy on a plane.

Investigators say in court documents filed Tuesday that the child was seated next to Kevin C. Matthews on the flight from Chicago to San Diego with a layover in Salt Lake City.

Charging documents say that the boy's mother was concerned about being seated across the aisle from her son Monday.

However, their family was flying standby and Matthews appeared to be friendly, according to the documents.

Prosecutors say other passengers saw Matthews touch the child inappropriately after the boy fell asleep and reported the groping to flight attendants, who moved the child to his mother's lap.

The Deseret News reported that Matthews is 48 and from Illinois.

He is facing an abusive sexual contact charge over the alleged incident on the Delta flight, according to the newspaper.

In an affidavit obtained by the Deseret News, a FBI agent said Matthews said he'd drank several glasses of wine, but denied being drunk.

Matthews also reportedly denied touching the child's groin with his hand.

Matthews told the agent 'it was possible that he touched (the boy), but if he did touch (him), it was an accident,' according to the affidavit.

Defense attorney Susanne Gustin did not immediately return a message seeking comment.
