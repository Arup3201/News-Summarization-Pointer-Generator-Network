A student suffers from a rare condition which means she spends up to six hours a day picking at her face until it bleeds.

Samantha Wake, 20, has dermatillomania - and dozens of scars across her face as a result.

She said: ‘Sometimes I actually look like I’ve been in a car crash.

Samantha Wake, 20, has permanent scarring on her face as a result of a rare condition which means she compulsively picks at her skin until it is raw and bleeding

‘People ask me what on earth has happened to my face. The truth is I’ve done this to myself and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to stop doing it. 

‘It’s a very real condition with very real consequences.’

Now, Ms Wake is revealing the full extent of her scarring for the first time to encourage doctors to learn more about the condition - and help sufferers know they aren’t alone.

When she first developed symptoms, Ms Wake felt she wasn’t taken seriously by doctors.

However, dermatillomania is thought to affect as many as one in 500 people in the UK and the vast majority are women.

It can affect all ages but most people with dermatillomania are between 15 and 30 years old.

Ms Wake will have scars for the rest of her life that will only get worse if she is unable to stop.

And her temptation to repeat the cycle every day is so strong that she wishes her main trigger point - the mirror - never existed.

Dermatillomania - or compulsive skin picking - is an impulse control disorder characterised by the uncontrollable desire to pick at one's skin.

Some sufferers have the condition so severely they pick at their skin until it is damaged.

Sufferers usually start by picking at their face before moving on to other parts of the body.

The condition is often categorised as an obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).

It can lead to bleeding, bruising and infections.

CSP will often be carried out after the individual has experienced a high level of tension which has caused an urge to carry out the behaviour.

The skin picking is often accompanied by a feeling of relief or even pleasure due to the reduction in anxiety levels.

However, once the damage has been done, those affected will often be left with a feeling of depression or hopelessness.

Although the damage that is caused can be very severe, the gratification experienced can lead the individual to carry out CSP again and again.

Treatment usually involves counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy.

If she detects even a minor blemish she will enter a trance-like state where she picks away for hours on end – sometimes even causing her to miss her animal management classes at Walford College.

‘It’s like my mind isn’t linked to my body,’ explained Ms Wake, from Telford, Shropshire.

‘If I detect even the tiniest flaw in my skin I will obsessively pick at it until I can’t feel any sign of it.

‘Unfortunately I’m always left with a much bigger mark - like a graze the size of a penny.

‘I know my face is covered in scars but I can’t tell the extent of it because there are so many scabs. My nose will be the worst and I have a dent in my left cheek.

‘Mornings and evenings are the worst. The first thing I do when I wake up is look in the mirror. If I let myself start picking I can’t think of anything else.

‘Hours can pass and I will miss my morning classes at college. At night I’ll leave my boyfriend on the settee watching a film while I disappear into the bathroom only to return raw and covered in sores. I’m trying my best to keep it under control but every day is a battle.’

The ritual is having a damaging impact on Ms Wake’s emotional health too, as afterwards she can be left feeling guilty and depressed.

And that in turn means she is ashamed to be seen in public and often shies away from going out.

She said: ‘I usually wear a thick layer of makeup when I leave the house but it doesn’t cover everything. When I talk to people I can see them looking at the marks instead of my eyes.

‘People ask me what’s wrong and I’m pretty honest about it now. I used to be embarrassed but now I see this is who I am. It is having a big impact though.

‘It’s made worse by anxiety and stress. If I’ve got a big event coming up like a holiday or a night out with friends I will desperately want my skin to be clear - but the pressure of that will make me pick more. So now I just don’t go out as much.’

The condition, related to obsessive compulsive disorder, is thought to be caused by anxiety and has similar traits to trichotillomania - where sufferers pull out their hair to calm their nerves.

Ms Wake says doctors did not initially take her seriously when she told them about her condition

Ms Wake first started picking at her face at the age of 14 when she developed some minor acne.

She said: ‘Even then I would pick obsessively at my spots but it was more like normal teenage picking. I went on tablets and the acne cleared up by the time I was 16, but the picking continued.

‘It got worse and worse and finally when I was 18 I decided to see a doctor. I felt like a freak.

‘At first no one would take me seriously. I remember leaving one appointment feeling so alone - like I must be the only person in the world doing this.

Ms Wake (pictured as a child) has had cognitive behavioural therapy but it did not cure her of the condition

‘It was only when my mum got involved that I was sent to have cognitive behavioural therapy. It helped me recognise some of the triggers and we talked about ways I could control my urges, like distracting myself by playing a game on my phone. My worst trigger is simply looking in the mirror. I wish mirrors didn’t exist.’

Some people with dermatillomania feel the urge to pick at their legs or arms, but Ms Wake’s focus has always been her face.

She said: ‘For me, my focal point is my nose. For about two years now my nose hasn’t healed. It will scab over and I will pull that off.

‘I’ve been given ointment and tablets to stave off skin infections.’

Ms Wake, who plans to one day work at a zoo, added: ‘I want other people like me to know they aren’t alone. I’ve recently connected with other sufferers on the internet and it feels amazing to know there are people out there like me.

‘I want people to realise this condition is real and I’m not just some person with horrible spots or some skin disease.

‘And I hope more effort is put into researching the condition so maybe one day there will be a cure, or at least doctors have more understanding about it.

‘But I’ve decided I won’t let it beat me. I have a really supportive family and a lovely boyfriend. I will keep a smile on my face and try harder every day to pick a bit less.’
