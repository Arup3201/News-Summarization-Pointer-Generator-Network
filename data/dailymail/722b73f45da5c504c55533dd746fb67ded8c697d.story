Neil Armstrong famously took 'one small step for man' to become the first human on the moon in 1969.

Now a series of Nasa documents reveal the astronaut's first steps were sketched out ahead of the historic Apollo 11 mission.

The drawings of how Armstrong, who died last weekend aged 82, would look during his two-and-a-half hour moon walk are 
among an enormous collection of Nasa memorabilia to go under the hammer 
next week.

Moon walk: A drawing from the Apollo 11 press kit showing how Neil Armstrong would look landing on the moon is just one of a haul of Nasa memorabilia up for auction

...And how he really looked: A cutting of the Buffalo Evening News' front page featuring pictures of Armstrong's first steps on the moon is also part of the collection

Space outfit: The press were also given detailed diagrams of what the astronauts would be wearing, left, and doing while on the moon, right

They were originally given to journalists in April 1969 ahead of the
mission in July of that year, but found their way into the hands of a 
British collector who has spent a lifetime amassing the impressive haul.

Now the collection, offered up for sale before Armstrong died, is expected to fetch a minimum of £10,000.

Other diagrams in the haul show how the Lunar Module would 
separate from the Command Module and how it would land.

Autographed: A photograph of Buzz Aldrin standing by the U.S. flag on the moon, signed by the astronaut is also part of the haul

Signed memories: The collection also includes signed photographs of Helen Sharman, left, the first British astronaut in space and Armstrong, right, the first man on the moon

Pin-tastic: The unnamed British collector wrote to Nasa in order to acquire many of the things in their collection, including this haul of badges

How it works: Other diagrams in the collection show how the Lunar Module would separate from the Command Module and how it would land

On a mission: The detailed black and white drawings in the press book also showed how the astronauts would collect samples and use their TV camera

Typed menus, meanwhile, reveal what Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins would have eaten during their lunar mission.

On a typical day breakfast was a fruit cocktail, 
sausage patties, bread cubes, cocoa and a grapefruit drink, while 
lunch was a frankfurter, apple sauce, chocolate pudding and orange 
grapefruit drink.

For 
dinner the astronauts tucked into spaghetti with meat sauce, pork and 
scalloped potatoes, pineapple fruitcake and grape punch.

That's dinner sorted: Menus revealing the typical meals the astronauts would be eating are also included in the collection

Treats: Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins tucked into banana and butterscotch pudding, cheese cracker cubes, BBQ beef bits and date fruitcake during the Apollo 11 mission

Other items in the collection include 
pieces of meteorites, moon dust paintings and a tape log featuring the 
doomed 1970 Apollo 13 mission.

The collection also includes official Nasa diagrams of space rockets, signed books and posters by Armstrong 
and other astronauts, official Nasa badges, models of space aircraft and
even the actual orange juice container chemist 
Helen Sharman drank from when she became the first Briton in space in 1991.

No sleeping in space: A model of the Lunar Module complete with toy astronaut is part of the enormous collection

Space men: Other models in the collection include astronauts in space suits and their crafts

Rock solid: The collector even had bits of meteorites, left, and a copy of First On The Moon, right, signed by Neil Armstrong who also wrote 'best of luck'

A lifetime's work: The collector, a lecturer in astronomy and aeronautics and fellow of the Royal Astronautics Society and British Interplanetary Society, collected the pieces from the late 1960s when he was a schoolboy

The 
collector, a lecturer in astronomy and aeronautics and a fellow of the 
Royal Astronautics Society and the British Interplanetary Society, collected the pieces from the late 1960s when he was a schoolboy.

It 
is believed he amassed the haul by contacting Nasa directly after being unable to find the items on sale in the UK.

Ian Crawford, sales room 
manager at Frank Marshall auctioneers in Knutsford said: 'The collection
has everything anyone could ever imagine as regards the space race.

Houston, we have a problem: The collection also boasts recordings from all the shuttle launches from 1965 to 1989, including the doomed 1970 Apollo 13 mission

Essential piece of kit: The Saturn 5 Interstage Cable from the Saturn 5 Rocket launched many Apollo Missions and connected the section between rocket and shuttle during take off

Lunar timepiece: A wrist watch with Moon Dust incrusted into its face is also up for auction

Fancy a drink? This is reportedly the orange juice container first British astronaut in space Helen Sharman drank out of

What a collection: Sales room manager Ian Crawford (pictured) at Frank Marshall auctioneers in Knutsford said: 'The collection has everything anyone could ever imagine as regards the space race'

'There
are bits of space craft, bits of meteors, signed pictures of astronauts,
it’s a really varied collection. The owner called in and asked us if we
could go out and inspect it all. It was so large we couldn’t do it all 
in one go.

'So we’ve made around five or six trips in total. He lives
in a bungalow, and all of it was on display so he’ll have space now. 
Some of it is quite rare and hard to value, while some have quite a 
historical reference.

'Most of it will make what it makes, but some of it we really can’t put a price on it.'

The will be held on September 4.
