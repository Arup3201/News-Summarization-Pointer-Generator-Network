Mystery man: But who is he?

Police investigating the theft of a laptop and two mobiles from a 59-year-old woman in April have reopened the case after her granddaughter started receiving photographs from one of the phones.

The gadgets were stolen in April from a house in Leytonstone, east London, and police initially closed the case without finding any solution.

Then the pictures starting arriving on the woman’s granddaughter’s phone via the communication application whatsapp whereby users can exchange text messages, photographs and videos free of charge.

No one knows who the mystery man is, if he has any connection to the thefts or if he has unwittingly bought the phone not knowing it was stolen.

The police detective work continues to try to find the stolen items, and to discover the identity of the man in the photographs.

WhatsApp allows smart phone users to text messages, photographs and videos free of charge to other users
