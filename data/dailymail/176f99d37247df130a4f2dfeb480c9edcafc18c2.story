The woman at the forefront of the design of Amir Khan's 24 carat gold shorts - the most expensive in sporting history - has detailed the process behind them ahead of the 28-year-old's world title bout against Devon Alexander on Saturday night.

Earlier this week it was revealed that Khan would be wearing the unique piece of clothing, worth around £30,000, when fighting against Alexander at the MGM Grand Garden in Las Vegas.

Sophie Whittam, designer of the shorts and creator of Fight Label, spoke in detail about the thinking behind the development of the shorts.

The 28-year-old will wear shorts worth an estimated £20,000-£30,000 for the fight with the American

The trunks, made specially for the fight, have genuine 24 carat gold thread woven into the waistband 

Sophie Whittam speaks to Sportsmail about the thinking behind Amir Khan's 24 carat gold shorts

'We weren't originally planning to do the 24 carat gold shorts, but then we had a very exciting opportunity with a new company called 24KT,' she told Sportsmail.

'They have a thousand exclusive members who can order any kind of clothing they wish, which can then be customised with 24 carat gold.

'Amir is one of their members so we then got talking and it was agreed we could use the 24 carat gold to make the waistband for his shorts.

'The outside of the shorts are covered in lamb nappa leather with crocodile trim, and then the lining is 100 per cent silk, so you have to combine all those materials  through different machines - so it was a jigsaw to put them all together.

'But I want every fighter to be unique and have unusual fabrics - so it was worth it.

Whittam, designer and creator of Fight Label,  spoke passionately about the process behind the shorts

'We started about four months ago on the training kit and then we were brainstorming ideas before putting pen to paper.

'It's probably been a four to six week period process to piece it all together and finalising all the designs for the fight night shorts.

'It's been a really exciting process working with Amir. At Fight Label I want to create people's dream shorts and make them a reality to wear. When you look good you feel good, and then you fight better too.

'Whether or not we had the material from 24KT we still strive to make unusual, unique fabrics and there's so many more different styles and trends to explore  - that's why I'm in this business.'

Despite her latest accomplishments Whittam is not standing still, and is already thinking of fresh plans for the future when she returns to the UK after this weekend's fight, admitting she'd relish the opportunity to work with Floyd Mayweather.

She added: 'Because of the rate we're rapidly expanding the immediate plan is to hire more staff when we get back.

'I'd love to do a pair for Floyd (Mayweather), as I think we could go really flamboyant, after judging by what he's worn at his previous fights at the MGM. 

'So one day it'd be nice for Fight Label to be up there in and amongst the Mayweather fame.'
