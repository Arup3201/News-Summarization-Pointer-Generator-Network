Michael O'Brien pocketed funeral charity donations to help balance the books of his struggling business

An undertaker pocketed funeral charity donations to help balance the books of his struggling business.

Michael O'Brien admitted keeping around £1,500 in donations while in charge at Murray's Funeral Directors in Dukinfield, Greater Manchester.

He said he had 'given into temptation' and stolen some of the cash as he struggled to balance the books after taking over the the firm from his father.

But the scale of his deceit 
unravelled when police were called and discovered a series of diligent 
notes detailing donations which hadn't been passed on.

It
 was found O'Brien had kept £800 intended for British Heart Foundation, 
£495 for MacMillan Cancer Support and £190 for Tameside General 
Hospital.

Human ashes were also seized as police raided the premises in October last year.

O'Brien,
 59, of Hyde, pleaded guilty to three counts
 of fraud by false representation between January 2010 and February 2013
 at Tameside Magistrates Court.

Defending, Steven Higgins said the fraud had been 'unsophisticated' and O'Brien had intended to replace the money.

He said: ‘He hasn't benefited to that amount as a large proportion of what the charities failed to receive is in the form of cheques that were still sitting in Mr O'Brien's safe.

‘This is a question of mismanagement rather than dishonesty but he was advised to plead guilty as there was cash removed.

Police and council officials also removed documents during the investigation last year, which was triggered by a string of complaints

‘He inherited the business from his father very much in debt. He accepts cash was available in his safe and it became a temptation in order to keep the business afloat.’

Police found a large number of financial paperwork, cheques and empty envelopes when they searched the premises.

For the prosecution, Matthew Curtis said: ‘He kept a meticulous account of his paperwork and that assisted the police in detailing the donations not passed on.’

O'Brien will be sentenced at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court on April 17.
