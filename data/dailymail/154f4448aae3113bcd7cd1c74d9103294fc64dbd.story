An Idaho family is suing a football helmet maker and the school district after their son suffered a traumatic brain injury during a football game.

Parents, Robert Clark II and Julie Clark, filed the lawsuit in September on behalf of their son, Robert ‘Bobby’ Norman Clark III, according to KTVB.com.

Lawsuit: The Clark family are suing the helmet maker, Riddell

The lawsuit names the West Bonner County School District and the helmet maker, Riddell.

It claims that Bobby was injured on September 30, 2011, while he was playing the position of lineman for the Priest River Lamanna High School Spartans.

The lawsuit, first reported by the Bonner County Daily Bee, says the teenager was briefly removed from the game, but then put back in by unidentified coaches.

After two plays he collapsed.

According to the suit, Bobby Clark suffered a ‘permanent and irreversible’ disability.

A photographer at the game managed to snap photographs of Bobby just moments before he was hurt.

A football game was organised at another school an hour away from Priest River to raise funds to donate to Bobby. The crowd was seen cheering and chanting in unison: 'We love Bobby'.
