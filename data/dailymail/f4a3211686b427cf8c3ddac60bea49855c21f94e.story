Edinson Cavani scored twice and Zlatan Ibrahimovic got his first club goal for nearly three months as Paris Saint-Germain overcame a second-half wobble to beat Ajax 3-1 in the Champions League.

PSG stay one point ahead of Barcelona in Group F before they meet at the Nou Camp in two weeks' time. Both teams had already qualified before Tuesday's games.

After Cavani scored for the third successive European game in the 33rd minute, Davy Klaassen leveled with a powerful header midway through the second half.

With Ajax gaining in confidence, PSG weathered a spell of pressure before Ibrahimovic soothed the nerves with an expertly-taken goal in the 78th.

Five minutes later, Cavani profited from a poor back pass to round Netherlands goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen and slot home.

PSG did not test Ajax's defense until midway through the first half, when Ibrahimovic released Ezequiel Lavezzi with down the right and the Argentina winger's shot was kicked away by Cillessen.

Ibrahimovic then headed over from six yards (meters) following a corner, but PSG's pressure finally told when Lavezzi went clean through and unselfishly squared the ball to Cavani, who rolled it into the empty net.

Ibrahimovic has only recently returned after nearly two months out with a heel injury and his enthusiasm to be back playing again got the better of him at times. Late in the first half, he was shown a yellow card for a thudding late challenge on Thulani Serero that sent the midfielder flying up in the air.

Just like in the away game in September, which finished 1-1, PSG was in control for the first hour before an alarming dip in concentration.

Ajax's equalizer came after a neat passing move.

PSG's players just sat back and watched as Ajax put a few passes together in midfield, before spreading the ball left. Given time to look up, and under no pressure, 19-year-old winger Ricardo Kishna whipped in a perfect cross and Klaassen's header flashed past goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu.

Ajax pushed forward and midfielder Lasse Schone clipped a free kick just over.

A minute later, Ibrahimovic showed just why defenders should never lose sight of him.

Collecting a bouncing pass from Javier Pastore on the right of the penalty area, the imposing Sweden forward cushioned it brilliantly and then arched his body to plant a diagonal shot into the bottom corner.

He had not scored for PSG since a hat trick against Saint-Etienne on Aug. 31.

Cavani's second goal was much simpler, as he ran onto a misjudged pass from Ajax midfielder Niki Zimling and finished confidently.

In the end it was a subdued and comfortable end to what was shaping up as a fiery encounter, at least in the stands.

After nearly 100 Ajax supporters were arrested in Paris the night before there was a strong police presence to prevent potential trouble between fans before the game.

Police say 95 fans, who were all Dutch, were arrested and detained on Monday night because they were armed, and had not been allowed to travel to the game.

PSG hooligans have a history of violence with their Dutch counterparts and police feared they would arrange fights before kick-off late Tuesday.

About three hours before the game, a group of Ajax fans was seen gathered in a small street near Saint-Michel square in Paris' historical centre surrounded by a group of riot police.

Another squad of riot police blocked off the other end of the street near to where a group of PSG supporters was gathering.

Police also surrounded the metro station at Odeon, which fans traditionally use to travel to the Parc des Princes stadium.

Six years ago, thugs from PSG and Dutch club FC Twente had clashed on the same street off Saint-Michel square hours before a UEFA Cup match, and last season hooligans from PSG and Bayer Leverkusen clashed on the platform at Odeon station.

Only 850 Ajax fans have been authorized to travel to the French capital under supervision of police forces. Police said the 95 fans arrested in downtown Paris were armed with iron sticks and knuckledusters, with ski masks later found in the bars where they were gathered.

Of those arrested Monday night, police released 41 supporters overnight while 54 remained in custody on Tuesday.
