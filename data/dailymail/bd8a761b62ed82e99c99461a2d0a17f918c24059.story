Five successful plus-size models who lost their representation when their mainstream agency, Ford Models, closed down its 'Ford +' division in 2013, have formed their own coalition.

The stunning New York-based models launched ALDA last year, describing themselves as 'a group of women aiming to represent beauty in all sizes' and have now appeared together in feminist culture magazine Bust's February issue.

'Some people are meant to be a size negative zero and some people are meant to be a size 16', says Danielle Redman, herself a U.S. size 12, who models a range of sportswear along with fellow ALDA members Ashley Graham, Marquita Pring, Inga Eiriksdottir and Julie Henderson.

All five ALDA models broke convention last January when they approached IMG Models in New York together and were later signed by the prestigious agency for its main board.

IMG's managing director Ivan Bart announced that the agency was on a mission to 'defy the typical stereotypes that have existed in the modeling industry for the past few decades.'

Ashley Graham, a 28-year-old Nebraska beauty with her own line of plus-size lingerie, told Bust: 'I've been called a plus-size model for 15 years.

'I don't have any shame with it, I don't really care... at the end of the day, I know who I am. I am Ashley Graham, and I am a model - I am not just a plus-size model.'

Nonsensical: Ms Eiriksdottir (pictured) doesn't see why there should be a gap between 'a curvier model and a straight-size model'

Icelandic stunner Inga Eiriksdottir, 30, made the switch from mainstream modeling, when she was a size 4, to the plus-size category several years ago.

'I never really understood that gap between being a curvier model and a straight-size model. It didn't really make any sense to me,' she says.

Julie Henderson, who fluctuates between a  size 12 and 14, told the publication: 'Fashion dictates so many things in our lives, and little girls grow up thinking that this is what beauty is.

'What ALDA does is say, "Listen, every woman is beautiful".'

Sisterhood: According to Ms Henderson (pictured), 'Together, we're going to change the world'

Marquita Pring, 24, also between a size 12 and 14, states: 'I think we're taking the industry by storm.'

Ms Henderson agrees. 'Together,' she says, 'we're going to change the world.'
