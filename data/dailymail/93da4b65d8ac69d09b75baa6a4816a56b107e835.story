England captain Steven Gerrard was prevented from playing his own game due to the defensive efforts of forward Edinson Cavani, according to Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez.

Roy Hodgson's men succumbed to a 2-1 defeat at the hands of La Celeste thanks to a Luis Suarez brace to leave them on the brink of elimination from Group D at the World Cup.

And Tabarez is convinced that Cavani's display was 'key' to Uruguay's victory over 'a wonderful team' as he shutdown the supply line which England talisman Gerrard usually provides.

Tabarez said: 'England doesn’t have weaknesses, they are very strong, have incredible midfield and have four strikers who are all goalscorers.

'But we played very well and Cavani played a very important role to counter that. Gerrard couldn’t play his game because Cavani was stopping him, so today they had more difficulties than normal.

'I think that was the key to the game. England are a wonderful team and are dangerous opponents, that’s why we’re so pleased to have won.'

Uruguay were dreadful in their first match and surprisingly lost 3-1 to Costa Rica, but Tabarez saw a vast important from his side against England.

The 67-year-old coach was also delighted that his team finally ended their 15-match winless record against European sides, but insists his team still have work to do to qualify for the last-16.

He said: 'If this was a movie, people probably couldn’t have wished for a better result.

'We have been able to beat a European team after a long, long time. Many people said we wouldn’t be able to do so.

'Both goals were scored by Luis Suarez, a player who was injured a month ago and had to go through surgery.

'We are not qualified yet for the next stage. However, we are happy we get some fresh air.'

The Uruguay coach was unsurprisingly full of praise for two-goal hero Suarez.

Tabarez said of the Liverpool striker: ‘In Uruguay the law says that if you've been in hospital, you need to leave the hospital in a wheelchair. But he could walk weeks ago, otherwise he couldn't have played today.

'His team-mates really love him. We all love him. He's a wonderful person and a very important player for our team. We admire him.

'We're very proud and happy having him here, and happy for his wife as well who has been with him all the time.

'Very thankful and very happy because people from the medical team have supported him from the beginning.

'Dr Pan said he would play in the World 
Cup. But we have respected him and his recovery.

'We decided we'd wait 
and see how he felt. He has trained well and played in a way that was 
really positive for our team today.

'We said "don't worry if things don't
 go well from the beginning at first", but I really trust him.

'And I 
know what he can do close to the goal. We're really happy. Luis and his 
family are really happy.'
