Sussex Arms landlord Paul Charalambous (pictured) was fined £70,000 after admitting negligence appeared in court today

A woman suffered a fractured spine when an eight and a half stone plant pot fell on her head as she enjoyed a drink outside a pub.

Margaret Jackson, 49, was outside the Sussex Arms near Paddington, west London, when the 54kg (120lb) planter dropped 10ft off the wall.

The painter and decorator suffered severe head injuries and spent two and a half months in hospital.

She was left with a fractured spine and broken ribs following the incident on October 3, 2010.

Mrs Jackson is now on the mend but prosecutor Adrian Chaplin said at Southwark Crown Court: 'She is unlikely to ever be able to return to her former work.'

Polynikis Charalambous, 34, who owns the pub, admitted negligence for failing to ensure punters were not exposed to risk.

He and his company were fined a total of £70,000.

Southwark Crown Court heard the planter was on the first-floor windowsill of the gastro pub.

But a guest who was staying in the hotel upstairs opened the window further than he should have been able to dislodging the pot, causing it to crash to the ground.

Mr Chaplain said: 'It weighed 54 kilos (8.5 stone) and fell 2.7m.

'It struck Margaret Jackson who was sitting underneath enjoying a drink.

'There was awning above so anyone sitting underneath would have been completely unaware of what was above them.

'It was just a bolt from the blue.'

The court heard the planter, which had an artificial tree in it, was weighed down with sand and concrete so it did not buckle in the wind.

Mr Charalambous, who runs the pub and
the Stylotel Hotel above with his family, thought it was 'unthinkable' 
anything like this could ever happen.

Matthew Kerruish-Jones, defending, said the company director had since undertaken numerous health and safety training.

He added: 'He and his family are truly sorry about this tragic accident leading to Mrs Jackson's tragic injuries.

'They were horrified and surprised by the circumstances.

'This was a combination of poor judgement and lack of appreciation to what the risks could be which inevitably lead to this dreadful accident.'

A judge heard it was a 'cruel irony' that had the windows been changed in 2009, without which the incident would never have occurred.

Sentencing Mr Charalambous, Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith said: 'I have to begin with Margaret Jackson, whose life has been so dramatically and sadly altered by what happened that day.

'One moment she was sitting and drinking with her friends, the next she suffered serious and potentially fatal injuries.

'She spent two and a half months in hospital and now finds herself unable to live the life she enjoyed.

'That planter, for three years, had been sitting in a position which carried a very forseeable risk of injury and death.

'This should have been prevented. Had the defendant had better training I have no doubt he would have appreciated this accident could have taken place.'

Mr Charalambous was personally fined £15,000 while his company will have to pay £55,000.

They must also pay the prosecution costs of £26,500.

Since the accident all planters from the pub have been removed.

The Charalambous family have also been paying for Mrs Jackson's rehabilitative care through their insurers.

James Armitage, of Westminster City Council, said: ‘This was a very serious case and the level of the fines handed down by the Court shows how seriously the Judge took the matter.

‘We hope it will serve to demonstrate the dangers of disregarding health and safety and planning law and the devastating affect it can have on people’s lives.

‘In this case, glaring neglect of health and safety responsibilities coupled with the director’s decision to ignore clear orders to change the windows have resulted in a woman’s life being changed forever.

‘If a retractable canopy had not broken the fall of the planter we could easily have been talking about a fatality.’
