New Ferrari chairman Sergio Marchionne claims the marque is ready to 'kick some ass' and take risks in order to return to the front in Formula One.

In taking over from former chairman Luca Di Montezemolo this week, Marchionne has come out all guns blazing and made clear Ferrari's continued lack of success is unacceptable.

The current campaign is the sixth in succession for Ferrari without a trophy to show for their efforts and considerable spend.

The day after Di Montezemolo confirmed star driver Fernando Alonso would be leaving Ferrari at the end of this season, Marchionne is ready to get tough.

'We've got to kick some ass and we've got to do it quickly,' said Marchionne, speaking to Autocar.

'It takes what it takes. We might screw up, but we've got nothing to lose, right? Let's risk something.'

It was Ferrari's abysmal performance in the Italian Grand Prix at Monza in early September that brought the team's situation home to roost for Marchionne.

'I keep getting reminded racing is not a science, that a number of factors influence performance,' said Marchionne.

'And then I go to Monza and see the first six cars are not Ferrari or powered by a Ferrari engine, and my blood pressure just popped.

'A non-winning Ferrari on the Formula One track is not Ferrari. I can live with periods of bad luck, but it cannot become a structural element of the brand.'
