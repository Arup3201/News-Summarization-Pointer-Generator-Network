A popular television satirist is being investigated for allegedly insulting the Egyptian president as Islamist lawyers continue to bring cases against outspoken media personalities in the country.

TV host Bassem Youssef is accused of insulting President Mohammed Morsi by putting the Islamist leader's image on a pillow and parodying his speeches.

Youssef, a doctor, catapulted to fame 
when his video blogs mocking politics received hundreds of thousands of 
hits shortly after the 2011 uprising that toppled longtime leader 
Mubarak.

Satire: Youssef has mocked President Mohammed Morsi, pictured, and ultraconservative clerics on his video blogs

Youssef's program is modeled after Jon Stewart's 'The Daily Show', where he has appeared as a guest.

Unlike other local TV presenters, 
Youssef uses satire to mock fiery comments made by ultraconservative 
clerics and politicians, garnering him a legion of fans among the 
country's revolutionaries and liberals.

Among his most popular clips are the ones where he pokes fun at the president's speeches and decisions.

While holding a red, furry pillow with Morsi's picture on it, Youssef satirizes Morsi's style of speech.

'The president understands us. He 
understands us better than we understand ourselves,' Youssef says in a 
clip. 'He tells us things we never knew,' he adds, before going to wordy
clips of Morsi going into detail about the day of the week and other 
basic facts.

'It's October 6! Tell us when it's Christmas!' Youssef shouts to the camera as the audience erupts in laughter and applause.

In another clip filmed shortly after Morsi issued power-grabbing decrees that placed 
him above judicial oversight, Youssef asks whether 
Egyptians created a revolution to remove a dictator and bring in another
one.

Youssef, 38, is one of Egypt's most 
popular TV presenters with 1.4 million fans on Facebook and nearly 
850,000 followers on Twitter, just shy of the president's number of 
followers.

The case against Youssef comes as opposition media and independent journalists grow increasingly worried about press freedoms under a new constitution widely supported by Morsi and his Islamist allies.

Other cases have been brought against media personalities who have criticizsd the president since Morsi's victory in the country's first free presidential election last summer. Some of the cases have ended with charges being dropped. Morsi's office maintains that the president has nothing to do with legal procedures against media critics.

A local committee of journalists and editors has called for stronger guarantees of press freedoms and a rejection of the current constitution, fearing it allows for jailing journalists under broadly-worded articles regarding media offenses.

Authorities ordered the closure of TV station 'Al-Fareen' last summer after bringing its owner, Tawfiq Okasha, to trial for scathing attacks against Morsi and his Brotherhood group.

Okasha had emerged as one of the most popular TV personalities of post-Hosni Mubarak Egypt by railing against the uprising that toppled Mubarak's 29-year rule in February 2011.

Another prominent case involved the editor of a prominent opposition newspaper, al-Dustour, who has since stepped down. He went on trial briefly for 'spreading lies' and fabricating news.

This latest case against a media personality comes as police today said they arrested a suspect in a shooting that seriously wounded a protester in Cairo's central Tahrir Square, where an open-ended sit-in protesting the Morsi regime is taking place.

According to witnesses, before dawn on Monday, gunmen shot and wounded 19-year-old Muhanad Samir, who has said he was jailed and tortured under Egypt's former ruling military council after he witnessed the killing of another activist. Lawyers say the attacked appeared to target Samir, who is battling for his life with pellets embedded in his head.

Security officials dismiss allegations Samir was the victim of a political assassination. They said they arrested the owner of a cafe in downtown Cairo who told police that he fired on the square after people manning makeshift checkpoints there searched his car and shot at him. The officials spoke anonymously in line with regulations.
