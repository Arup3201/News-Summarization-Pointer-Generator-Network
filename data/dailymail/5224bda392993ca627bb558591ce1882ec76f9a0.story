A Sunday school teacher who killed another man in a road rage brawl last year faces only one year in jail after an autopsy revealed he died because of a problem with a popular anti-stroke drug.

Librado Cena, 58, killed William O’Brien with a single punch to the head last April after the two men fought in a Fairfax City mall parking lot because the 63-year-old honked at him too many times.

Cena remarkably faces only 12 months in prison on a misdemeanor assault and battery charge in a trial set to start Monday after initially facing life because an autopsy revealed the unstoppable bleeding – not the punch – caused O’Brien’s death.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

On trial: Librado Cena faces on year in prison after it was discovered Pradaxa was to blame for William O'Brien's death, not his punch

The bleeding on the brain caused by the punch was allowed to continue unabated because O’Brien taking Pradaxa prevented it from clotting, he died about one hour later.

Mall surveillance video released to the Washington Post by local police shows Cena running up to O’Brien from behind. The two men then face each other and square off.

They trade blows, shove each other and go their separate ways – O’Brien to Best Buy and Cena drives off.

O’Brien initially was fine, similar to ski accident victims who hit their heads but initially feel fine before collapsing unconscious.

Doctors refer to the brief time before realizing how grave their head injuries are as the lucid interval, it doesn’t last long.

He was able to make it home after buying a router, according to the Post, but had already begun experiencing severe head pain.

Where the fight occurred: Cena and O'Brien traded punches in this Fairfax City mall parking lot, O'Brien went to the Best Buy before collapsing only an hour later

‘I have a headache that, it’s about to make my head blow off,’ he said in a 911 call an hour later, according to the Post.

O’Brien collapsed on his floor and was unconscious before paramedics arrived.

Authorities
 charged Cena with aggravated malicious wounding as O’Brien lie in a 
coma in a local hospital. He would have faced life in prison if 
convicted of the felony.

That changed after an autopsy revealed O’Brien’s Pradaxa, not Cena punch, is what killed him.

Doctors
 are aware of the problem, but an expert told the Post of their 
inability to stop the blood from flowing into the cranium and squeezing 
the brain.

‘We don’t have a good way to control it,’ said Richard Schmidt, a University of Utah School of Medicine professor who co-authored a paper on the topic.

A spokesperson for Boehringer-Ingelheim, the Germany-based manufacturer of Pradaxa, did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.

Prosecutors were unable to figure out which charges to level against Cena, but a grand jury settled on misdemeanour assault.

O’Brien’s family claimed to the paper his attacker was getting off with only a slap on the wrist.

The brief encounter dramatically changed the lives of both families when O’Brien finally succumbed to his injuries.

The culprit: Blood thinning anti-stroke drug Pradaxa has been blamed for O'Brien's death because it allowed blow to flow unabated into his cranium

Cena lost his job as the religious director of the local church, his wife told the paper. He has been out of work since.

‘Lee has been made to look like a monster,’ Janice Cena lamented  ‘Through this whole thing, we have been praying for truth and justice . . . that is all we ask.’

His daughter dropped out of school and is mired in depression. The Cenas are near insolvency while struggling to get by on one income and paying mounting legal bills.

Librado Cena declined to talk to the paper, but issued the following statement:

'The events of the past 9 months have been very difficult for me and my family. I know that Mr. O’Brien’s family has suffered tremendously as well and my wife and I are deeply sorry for their loss.

'We have prayed for Mr. O’Brien and his family and we will continue to pray for them.’
