To head off unwanted advances, women should avoid an 'upward inflection' when speaking, learn to accept compliments gracefully and imagine their grandmother was in the room during interaction with male colleagues.

This advice doesn't come from the pages of a 50s etiquette guide, but courtesy of an employee education and training service used by companies such as Groupon, Google, Eventbrite and Ask.com.

The service responsible, Jhanaeducation.com, recently published the article, entitled: 'What if a male colleague gets the wrong idea?'

An employee education and training service used by the likes of Groupon and Google has published an article instructing women on how not to lead men on in the workplace

And it's enraged some women. Writing on Jezebel, Erin Gloria Ryan, who spotted the feature, said: 'The problem with the piece - besides the fact that it treats its target audience like actual sex idiots - is that it once again implies that women are responsible for how men behave and what men think.'

Tips include avoiding 'revealing clothing' and the manual states: 'If you’re touchy-feely or flirtatious by nature, you might want to dial it back around him and any guys from whom you sense discomfort.'

 'If you’d feel embarrassed saying or doing whatever you’re about to say or do in front of Grandma, don’t go there'

The article discusses how the way women dress can affect their position in the workplace: 'In a perfect world, women would feel
free to dress however they want without being stigmatized for it.'

'Know that revealing clothing and certain verbal tics, such as ending 
statements with an upward inflection in your voice or struggling to 
accept a compliment, can affect others’ ability to take you seriously.'

And apparently the greatest weapon a woman has against inadvertent flirting is her grandmother: 'Don’t say or do anything you wouldn’t say or do in the presence of 
your grandmother. If you sense that you could start unconsciously 
flirting (you’re human, and sometimes it happens), imagine that your 
grandmother is in the room.

'If you’d feel embarrassed saying or doing whatever you’re about to say or do in front of Grandma, don’t go there.'

And it even provides tips for when the male in question doesn't quite get the hint. 'If he still doesn't get the message, socialize in groups, especially after hours and outside the office.

The article states that revealing clothing can affect others' ability to take you seriously

'There's a greater chance that the guy will misinterpret your behaviour in 1-on-1 situations that happen outside the office.

'Leave when everyone else does. And try to avoid letting him pick up the tab.'

The manual instructs women to use their 'creep-o-meter' to determine whether the man is getting the wrong message.

'Always
pay attention to your creep-o-meeter. Every woman has one. If you get 
even a faint whiff of creepiness off of the guy or anyone else at work, 
ask yourself if it's really worth trying to know the person. In most 
cases, it isn't.'

It 
concludes with: 'Still confused? You should be. This is a confusing 
topic with a long, confusing history' and then directs women to further 
reading material to help them 'delve deeper' into the topic.

Website Jezebel's thoughts on the subject were, however, more clear cut: 'Unsurprisingly,
a male equivalent (How Not to Act All Skanky In Your Tie And Your 
Business Clothes) doesn't seem to exist... Men are not advised to keep 
their clavicles under wraps, lest their lady colleagues be driven mad 
with lust.'

Rob Cahill, CEO and co-founder of Jhana Education told MailOnline: 'We did not intend to offend or blame anyone with our recent article on gender relations in the workplace.

'Based on the thoughtful feedback we received, we are re-thinking our approach to this topic.'
