A chilling audio recording of a phone call likely made by Newtown killer Adam Lanza to a radio show a year before his deadly rampage gives a terrifying look inside the 20-year-old's sick mind.

Lanza apparently spoke on Oregon college radio show Anarchy Radio on December 11, 2011 and compared a chimpanzee that famously tore off the face a Connecticut woman to a human mass killer.

'I just... don't think it would be such a stretch to say that he very well could have been a teenage mall shooter or something like that,' he said about Travis the chimp in a recording, which was first reported by Sandy Hook Lighthouse.

Although he disguised his voice and used the name Greg, friends said the recording sounds just like the killer. And online discussions by an internet forum user called Smiggles - a name known to be used by Lanza - also nod at the eerie call being made by him.

'Travis wasn’t an untamed monster at all': Sandy Hook killer Adam Lanza (right) professed a bizarre affinity with Connecticut chimpanzee Travis (left), who tore off a woman's face in 2009, as he called a radio show

Lanza spoke for some seven minutes in a
 soft voice to host John Zerzan, whose fringe worldviews 
somehow kept him from seeing just how bizarre and frightening Lanza's 
statements truly were.

He spoke about Travis the chimp, who made headlines in 2009 
after ripping off the face and arm of a Connecticut 
woman named Charla Nash. She would later receive a face transplant.

'His 
attack can be seen entirely parallel to the attacks and random acts of 
violence that you bring up on your show every week, committed by humans,
 which the mainstream also has no explanation,' Lanza said.

'Travis wasn’t an untamed monster at all,' caller 'Greg' said. 'Um, he wasn’t just feigning domestication, he was civilized. Um, he was able to integrate into society.

Violent: Travis's attack left Charla Nash 
horribly disfigured (right), though the radio caller - believed to be 
Adam Lanza - says the animal was just misunderstood by society

Chilling: Anarchy Radio host John Zerzan, pictured, said he did not find anything alarming about the call

'[Travis] didn't really act any differently than a human child would and the people who would use that as an indictment against having chimps live as humans do wouldn't apply the same thing to humans so it's just kind of irrelevant.'

Zerzan, 70, of Eugene, Oregon remembers the call but somehow found nothing alarming about it.

'There's nothing there indicating he was considering something so heinous and inconceivable,' Zerzan told The New York Daily News.

'It was a year before Sandy Hook, so no one has any idea what he was thinking a year before…I don't see how anyone could have guessed that with what was said.'

Connecticut authorities would not confirm that the recordings were of Lanza. But a trail of internet forum comments and evidence collected in the sprawling investigation strongly suggest it was.

Evidence: In this digital evidence report, Lanza's forum name is listed as 'Smiggles' - the same user who commented about speaking on the radio show

Red flags: Lanza regularly shared messages on the forum, including this about feeling schizophrenic

Confirmed: Kyle Kromberg (pictured), who went to school with Lanza, said the voice is definitely his

A
 public safety investigation report on Lanza's shooting spree - which left 20 students 
and six teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary dead - 
indicates Lanza was known to use the alias Smiggles on internet forums.

On
 the discussion board Shocked Beyond Belief, user Smiggles wrote about 
Zerzan just before the call believed to be from Lanza was made.

'I should call in on John Zerzan's radio program about Travis,' Smiggles wrote. 'I'm
 really surprised that I haven’t been able to find anything he’s written
 or said about the incident, considering how often he brings up random 
acts of violence. It seems like Travis would be a 
poster-chimp of his philosophy.'

Smiggles also posted about the call the next day.

'It didn’t go as horribly as I 
anticipated. I wish that I hadn’t spoken nonstop about Travis for so 
long, but I didn’t want to seem crazy by randomly bringing up a 
chimpanzee for unknown reasons,' Smiggles wrote.

Killer: Adam Lanza shot himself dead after his deadly rampage on December 14, 2012 in Newtown

Just a year before: The call was made December 11, 2011, almost a year to the day that Lanza went on his armed rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary in the most shocking mass shooting in American memory

In another post on the same site, he wrote: 'Well, I feel schizophrenic.'

In
 addition to the internet evidence trail, friends and associates of 
Lanza's have also confirmed the recordings are of the killer.

'As soon as he opened his mouth (in the audio clip), I knew it was him,' Kyle Kromberg, 21, told the Daily News.

Kromberg
 attended high school with Lanza for years and spoke to him each day. 
Another friend confirmed the recording was of Lanza, as well.

'Yes, I think it’s him,' said the unidentified friend. 'It does sound like something he would say. But he is talking funny.'
