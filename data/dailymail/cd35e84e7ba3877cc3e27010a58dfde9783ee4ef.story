Angel di Maria's imminent move to Manchester United is a step closer after he passed a medical ahead of his £59.7million plus add ons deal from Real Madrid.

The deal, which would be a British transfer fee record, would see Di Maria earn £200,000-a-week wages over a five-year contract. 

The scale of the extra fees due from United will depend on the 26-year-old's performances and the prospect of him winning the Ballon D'Or award.

International pedigree: Di Maria was part of Argentina's 2014 World Cup squad that were finalists

The Argentina star flew to Manchester on Monday ahead of the move to England and  his agent Jorge Mendes was spotted with Red Devils boss Louis van Gaal on Tuesday afternoon.

Van Gaal was all smiles with Mendes as the pair drove to United's Aon Training Complex as they look to finalise the deal to bring Di Maria to the club. 

Di Maria will join up with his new United team-mates at training on Thursday and the club hope to formalise his work permit and registration by noon on Friday if he is to figure against Burnley on Saturday. 

Di Maria's arrival would provide a boost to the club after a poor start to the season.

Van Gaal's side have only picked up one point from a possible six after losing their Premier League opener 2-1 at Swansea and drawing 1-1 at Sunderland on Sunday.
