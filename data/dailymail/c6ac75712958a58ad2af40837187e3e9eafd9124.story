Google announced yesterday the purchase of Boston Dynamics, a company that builds military robots - though no one knows what the search engine has planned for the cyborgs.

This was the eighth robotics acquisition in the past sixth months. The initiative is headed by Andy Rubin, the executive responsible for leading development on the Android smartphone, who says the project is a 'moonshot' and that product development is still several years away.

Up until their purchase by Google, Boston Dynamics was making research robots for the Defense Adanvanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the U.S. government agency responsibly for developing new military technologies.

Google would not say how much they paid for the company and will not be releasing financial information. They said the company will fulfill all current government contracts, but that Google will not be taking on any more military work.

Boston Dynamics was founded in Waltham, Massachusetts by ex-MIT professor  Dr Marc Raibert in 1992.

Since then, they have been developing
 animal-like robots that can travel faster than the fastest human, and 
even cover difficult terrains like snowy hills and icy roads.

Fast one: WildCat is another of Boston Dynamics' super fast robots. WildCat isn't as fast as Cheetah, but can cover a variety of terrains

While most of their work has been done for the U.S. government, Dr Daibert told the New York Times that he does not consider his company to be a military contractor and they are simply trying to advance robotics technology.

One of the projects they're currently working on for DARPA is the creation of a robot that can  operate in a natural disaster, like the nuclear power plant meltown in Fukushima, Japan.

'Competitions like the DARPA Robotics Challenge stretch particpants to solve problems that matter and we hope to learn from the team's insight around disaster relief,' Mr Rubin said in a statement released by Google.

And the company has been pretty transparent on what they're developing. They even have their own YouTube account where they show off what their robots can do.

A robot named 'Cheetah' was designed for maximum speed, and was filmed running on a treadmill at speeds up to 29mph which is one mph faster than the world's fastest man - Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt. That beat the previous record of 13.1 set by a robot in 1999.

Boston Dynamic's other robots aren't as fast but are designed to cover more treacherous terrain. Their collection includes both two- and four-legged robots that can climb walls and trees.

A robot named 'WildCat' was designed to run fast on all types of terrain and was filmed galloping in a parking lot.

The robot named Big Dog can climb a steep incline even in the snow, and is able to balance itself on slippery ice.

Dr Raibert is the so-called 'father of walking robots' in the U.S. and started the Leg Lab at Carnegie Mellon University in 1980 to explore walking machines.

He brought the lab to MIT before leaving academia to start engineering work for the miliatary and Sony.

'I am very excited by Andy and Google's ability to think very, very big, with the resources to make it happen,' he said.
