A woman from southern California has been arrested after her boyfriend's two-year-old daughter suffered a seizure and died after eating chilli powder.

Amanda Sorensen, 21, of Apple Valley, was taken into custody on Monday for allegedly feeding the chilli to the child as punishment.

Authorities confirmed Sorensen had been arrested on suspicion of child abuse resulting in death.

Police were called to the family home in the Apple Valley at 4.16pm on Sunday where they found the girl, who was the daughter of Sorensen's boyfriend.

The toddler, whose name has not been released, was rushed to a nearby hospital where she was pronounced dead.

An investigation is ongoing, a sheriff’s spokeswoman told KTLA, and an autopsy will be carried out to determine the exact cause of death.

Jodi Miller told the New York Daily News: 'We responded to a report of a child suffering a seizure. We did not comment as to anything that may have occurred as part of the ongoing investigation.'

Chilli's main ingredient Capsaicin is an irritant in humans and other mammals, causing a burning sensation in the tissues with which it comes into contact.

Airway resistance increases following inhalation of capsaicin in both mild asthmatics and non-asthmatic people.

Capsaicin can be fatal in large quantities. Symptoms of overdose include difficulty breathing, convulsions, and changes in skin colour.

If a baby ingests chilli powder it can swell the airways and cause them to stop breathing.

Neighbors told NBC San Diego that 
they didn't notice anything unusual about the house and would see 
several children from toddlers to teenagers entering and leaving the 
home.

'I would give them the benefit of the
 doubt,' neighbor Patricia Amado said. 'I can't imagine a parent 
purposely doing something like that to a young child.'

Sorensen is being held at the West Valley Detention Centeron on $500,000 bail and is due in court on Wednesday.
