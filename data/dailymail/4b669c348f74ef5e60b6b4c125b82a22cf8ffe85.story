Around 20,000 mothers with young children have begun ‘direct selling’ jobs over the last year, with many saying they needed to earn money after the loss of their child benefit.

The Direct Selling Association said it has witnessed a 20 per cent jump in the number of working mothers over the last year, to a total of around 120,000.

The work has been taken with companies such as Avon, Amway, Betterware and Kleeneze which sell to people directly, rather than using a shop.

Following a cut in child benefit more mothers are taking to direct selling as a way maintain their lifestyles

For example, mothers might hold parties to sell the products, and receive a commission depending on how much they manage to sell. Others use catalogues or door-to-door selling.

When asked why they had decided to take the jobs, many said they urgently needed extra money to cope with the rising cost of living, made worse by the loss of child benefit.

New rules, which came into effect in January, mean couples no longer receive child benefit if one of them earns more than £60,000, and it begins to be cut once their salary is over £50,000.

Even for families who continue to receive the benefit, it has been frozen since 2010 at £20.30 per week for the first child and £13.40 for each subsequent child.

Andy Smith, general manager of Amway UK, which makes everything from cosmetics to washing powder, said: ‘The recent changes to child benefit have affected thousands of mums, while the rising cost of living continues to impact on families all over the county.

‘Families are under increasing pressure at the moment.

‘We are continuing to see mums being attracted to direct selling as an alternative, and flexible way to generate an income in these difficult times.’

A total 120,000 mothers are now using direct selling as a way of boosting stretched home budgets

Direct selling is highly attractive to women, who represent around three-quarters of its workforce, because they can control when they work.

Many choose to work only while their children are at school, or only in the evenings when their children are asleep, allowing them to avoid the crippling cost of paying for childcare.

Lynda Mills, director of the Direct Selling Association, said: ‘Parents are often faced with an impossible choice.

‘They can return to work, often under difficult circumstances and face astronomical childcare costs, or they can stay at home resulting in no income.’

Official figures from the Office for National Statistics show how the number of working women is rising rapidly.

More than seven in ten mothers who are married or living with a partner are working, the highest percentage since records began.

Over the last two years, around 200,000 women who are married or living with a partner and have young children have joined the workforce.

This was larger than the total increase in working mothers which took place during the previous 15 years, according to the figures from the ONS.

Mothers can find an office job difficult after childbirth and relish the flexibility of door-to-door sales

The Direct Selling Association said many mothers turn to direct selling due to the problems that they face after returning from maternity leave.

Many find flexible or part-time work is not available, or can only find part-time work which is badly paid and far below their skill level.

Many do go back to their job but find it is entirely incompatible with family life due to the rigidity of the hours that they are required to work, forcing them to miss important events, such as their children’s nativity play or sports day.

Dame Stella Rimington, former director general of MI5 highlighted this problem for mothers this week.

She said: ‘I had so many moments where I would worry about being late for the sports day or late for the meeting because I was at sports day.

‘It was perpetual really - you take a day off because your child is in the school play and then some drama will happen at the office.

‘I still had to go home and explain to my child why I didn’t make it.

‘There were a number of things I missed - I wish I could go back too. When they were growing up I relied hugely on nannies and grannies.’
