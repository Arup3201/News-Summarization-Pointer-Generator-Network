To keep a marriage secret for six days in the world of celebrity is no mean feat, but to keep it secret for six years is something else altogether. 

But that's exactly what Russian businessman Roman Abramovich, 48, and his magazine editor wife Dasha Zhukova, 33, managed to do as it was only revealed yesterday that the pair wed many years ago. 

Indeed, it was only in a recent article in The Wall Street Journal that the detail of their relationship was let slip.

The Wall Street Journal revealed that Roman Abramovich has been married to his 'girlfriend' Dasha Zhukova

The publication referred to the couple saying that they, 'met in 2005 and were married a few years later.' 

It has been reported that Russian-American Dasha gave her permission for the article to run the details but did not give any more information about when exactly she and the Chelsea FC owner  wed.

So who is the woman who managed to tame one of the world's richest businessmen? 

Born in Moscow,  to an scientist mother and oil trader father, Darya or 'Dasha' moved to US with her mother at the age of 10 when her parents split up.

No trophy wife, Dasha attended the University of California, Santa Barbara, and graduated with honours with degrees in Slavic Studies and Literature.

Dasha met Roman in 2005 when he was married to his second wife Irina Vyacheslavovna Malandina, reportedly at a New Year party organised by her oil magnate father. 

She was dating former Russian tennis star Marat Safin at the time.

The power couple became officially linked in 2007 after Roman had divorced. 

In February 2009 Dasha, who previously owned her own fashion label Kova & T, was made editor of avant garde fashion magazine, POP.

However, she got everyone talking when she sensationally quit after just three issues.

Then in 2014 she caused uproar by posing for a photograph, in which the chair she sat in was formed from a black female mannequin, in online fashion publication Buro 24/7.

Both Dasha and the publication were accused of racism and she later released a statement saying: 'This photograph, which has been published completely out of context, is of an art work intended specifically as a commentary on gender and racial politics.

'I utterly abhor racism and would like to apologize to those offended by my participation in this shoot.'

A popular socialite, Dasha has regularly been seen out and about with some of society and fashion's finest.  

She now runs her own magazine Garage - as well as an arts centre in Russia - which is part-funded by her husband.

Dasha is also mother to two children by Abramovich, a son named Aaron and a daughter named Leah.

The couple own homes in London, Moscow, Colorado, the Caribbean and the South of France and Roman also owns some of the world's biggest yachts.  

Dasha isn't Roman's first wife, in fact the owner of Chelsea Football club has actually been married twice before and has seven children...

Wife number 1: Olga Yurevna Lysova (1987-1990)

Little is known about Roman's first wife Olga. The couple married in 1987 but were divorced just three years later in 1990. They did not have any children together. 

In 1988 the couple set up a market stall selling dolls  - a business which she described has having bought the couple success almost immediately.

And it was a wedding present from Olga's parents that would help him to make his first investment. They gifted the newlyweds 2,000 rubles - around £1,000 at the time - which he invested and managed to double and then triple the cash within a year.

Roman and his second wife Irina married in 1991 and split in  2007  amid reports that he was dating Dasha

Wife number 2: Irina Vyacheslavovna Malandina (1991-2007)

Just a year after his divorce from Olga, Roman married air-stewardess Irina Vyacheslavovna Malandina in 1991. 

The couple had five children: Arkadiy, Ilya, Arina, Sofia and Anna but subsequently divorced in 2007 as it was reported in 2006 that Roman already had a close friendship with Dasha, who was then  25.

Much speculation followed as to how much their divorce settlement would be worth with it eventually being reported that Irina had been awarded £155million - the largest settlement in the world.
