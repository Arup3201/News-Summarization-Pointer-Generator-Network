A four-year-old boy had his leg amputated after he was severely injured in an attack by his father's police dog.

Hunter Mastaler, as named in local reports, had his left leg amputated a few inches below the knee following damage to the arteries and veins, and will receive a prosthetic leg.

The attack occurred at the family's home in Hesperia, California last Sunday afternoon involving police take-home K9 Jango - the dog handled for two years by the child's father, Michael Mastaler, an officer for the Rialto Police Department.

Neighbors said they heard the boy screaming when the attack happened on February 8 around 4.30pm.

Mr Mastaler had been away for two days when he returned home and let six-year-old Jango out of his kennel, and into the backyard before going upstairs, according to the Victorville Daily Press.

While he was in the shower, Hunter, who was left watching TV and playing games, wandered into the backyard after somehow making his way through the sliding glass door, and was attacked by the Belgian Malinois.

The boy's mother had been out running errands and he was looking for her when he made his way outside, according to Police Captain Randy DeAnda.

When neighbors heard screaming coming from the Mastalers' backyard, one broke through the wooden fence and another pulled Hunter from the dog's mouth.

Shannon Houlemard, whose husband Jeff, broke down the fence said they ran over after her sons heard screaming from down the road.

When neighbors heard screaming coming from the Mastalers' backyard, one broke through the wooden fence and another pulled Hunter from the dog's mouth. One neighbor said he kicked the dog but it would not let go so he had to pull the animal's mouth open

She said: 'There was a neighbor over there first who was just trying to hit the dog over the fence with a pole or something, but my husband knocked the fence over, and another kid who is a freshman in high school actually pulled (the boy) from the dog's mouth.'

During Mr Houlemard's attempts to break down the fence he said he gave it his all.

'I hit (the fence) with all I had, fell and busted my shoulder, but I ran right through it,' he said. 'I kicked the dog, but it still didn't let him go, so I whipped him around and pulled the (dog's) mouth open. 

'(A neighborhood teen) pulled the boy out of the dog's mouth. (The boy's leg) was already facing the wrong direction. The attack was probably going on for at least two minutes before he was pulled out. It was so traumatic.'

Anthony, 14, who pulled Hunter from Jango's mouth said he was not scared, according to CBS Los Angeles.

He said: 'It was more of his life, you know, he’s a little boy. He has more to live.'

Jango will not be returning to the family's home (pictured above) and has been placed with Hesperia Animal Control in a ten-day quarantine

After neighbors banged on windows and rang the doorbell to alert Mr Mastaler, he eventually came out and got Jango under control before placing him in his cage.

As they waited for the ambulance to arrive at the scene, the Houlemards waited with Hunter, sang the alphabet and counted to keep him alert. 

Mr Houlemard said he did not believe the incident happened as a result of negligence.

'(Mastaler) was hitting himself in the head, (saying), 'What the hell?' Like he had no idea how it happened,' he said. 'He was beating himself up over it and I was just telling him to help his son, and talk to him.'

The young boy was airlifted to Loma Linda University Medical Center where he has received treatment since last Sunday. 

The results following the police department's investigation will determine the the dog's fate

According to Police Captain Randy DeAnda, he said that the department thinks the bite was 'accidental' and that it was a very 'tragic accident'

A GoFundMe page, which has named Hunter and the Mastaler family, has said that Hunter's recovery will continue even once he leaves hospital. 

Jango will not be returning to the family's home and has been placed with Hesperia Animal Control in a ten-day quarantine.

The results following the police department's investigation will determine the the dog's fate.

DeAnda said that it is common procedure for police dogs to live with their handlers, and that under supervision of the handler, the dogs do bond with families.

He said that the department thinks the bite was 'accidental' and that it was a very 'tragic accident'. 

Hunter's Relief Fund has already received $3,550 in donations since it was created today.
