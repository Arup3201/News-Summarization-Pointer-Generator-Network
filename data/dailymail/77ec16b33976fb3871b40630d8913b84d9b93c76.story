Dozens of wives of North Korean servicemen have been pictured weeping with uncontrollable joy after meeting the county's despotic leader Kim Jong-un.

A group photograph released by the state-run Korean Central News Agency showed Kim looking measurably calm while surrounded by row upon row of brightly dressed women who appear unable to control their emotions in his presence.

Although there are scores of women in the photograph, which was taken after a meeting with the families of 'Exemplary' servicemen - a rank within the North Korean military - almost every one of them appears overwhelmed, with tears flooding down their cheeks and tissues pressed against their faces.

The highly-choreographed image was taken at an event titled 'The Second Meeting of KPA Exemplary Servicemen's Families'. Although the state-run Korean Central News Agency did not date the photograph, in is believed to have been taken in recent days.

Other photographs of the official visit show Kim posing with young children who are dressed in full military uniform, and giving a speech in an auditorium packed to the rafters with huge crowds of women who applaud him wildly. 

Throughout the visit, Kim was flanked by members of the North Korean military wearing Khaki uniform and their distinctive oversized peaked caps.

However before and after his speech in the huge meeting hall, Kim was seated on an elevated top table alongside his wife, whose official title is Comrade Ri Sol-ju. 

Very little information about Ri Sol-ju has appeared in official North Korean sources, but she is known to have attended a number of public functions alongside the 31-year-old North Korean dictator, and is often spotted wearing black trouser suits made by the fashion house Chanel.

She is believed to be aged between 25 and 29 and her professor father and gynecological nurse mother are considered members of the country's political elite. Ri Sol-ju, which may well be a pseudonym, is understood to have married Kim in 2009 and the couple have at least one child together.

Images of Kim's state visit come after North Korean officials denied accusations they are behind the recent hacking raids on Sony Pictures that has seen a cache of confidential documents leaked from the company's archive about celebrities' private lives.

The latest cache of confidential documents leaked from Sony's archives includes the assumed names actors and actresses use to check into hotels and book car services.

Daniel Craig, Natalie Portman, Ice Cube and Jessica Alba will all be forced to switch their pseudonyms after their details were published online by the so-called Guardians Of Peace hacker group.

North Korean officials denied being the hacks, despite increasing evidence apparently linking the pariah state to them and an official statement branding the privacy invasions a 'righteous deed.

A theory has been put forward suggesting North Korean hackers targeted Sony Pictures out of anger at the release of a film called The Interview.

The movie stars James Franco and Seth Rogen as TV reporters hired by the CIA to assassinate Kim Jong Un. 

Yesterday a missive apparently posted by the hackers on code-sharing site GitHubGist demanded Sony 'stop immediately showing the movie of terrorism which can break the regional peace and cause the war!'

Investigators have traced the hacking attacks  back to the St. Regis Bangkok hotel - a five-star resort in Thailand's capital. 

Authorities are not sure whether the hackers stayed as guests at the hotel, simply used the wifi in the lobby, or routed the traffic through the hotel.
