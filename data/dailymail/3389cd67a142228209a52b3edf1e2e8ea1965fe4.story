Members of the public are being asked to design the 'tails' side of the new £1 coin in a nationwide art competition.

Chancellor George Osborne said the design will be 'in millions of people's pockets and purses' when the coin is launched in 2017.

The new coin will be the same shape as the 12-sided threepenny or 'thrupenny' bit, which was in circulation until 1971, and officials say designers claim the new coin will be the hardest to copy in the world.

Ministers say urgent action is needed to combat the number of counterfeits in circulation.

The Royal Mint estimates that an astonishing 45million £1 coins – 3 per cent of the total – are fake.

The figure is as high as 6 per cent in some parts of the UK and two million counterfeits are removed from circulation every year.

The competition to design the 'tails' side of the coin is open to anyone, irrespective of how old they are or where they are from, the Treasury said. All entries must be submitted by October 30.

Entrants are being asked to 'show what Britain or 'Britishness' means, drawing on all of the qualities and quirks that make our nation unique'.

Mr Osborne said: 'Today we're asking people across the UK to help us design the new £1 coin.

Chancellor George Osborne said he wanted the design to capture Britishness

'Think about your favourite landmark, or a great British achievement or a symbol from our Islands' Story. 

'The winning design will be in millions of people's pockets and purses. It'll be heads you win; tails, it's your design.'

The £1 coin has been in use since 1983 – much longer than the normal life cycle for legal tender of its value – and 1.5billion were in circulation as of March 2013. 

The outdated technology used to make the coin leaves it vulnerable to sophisticated counterfeiters.

Its replacement will be roughly the same size with security features including bi-metallic construction, the 12-sided design and the use of iSIS – integrated Secure Identification System. This means an additive is built into coins which can be authenticated by high-speed scanners.

The technology will allow vending machines to spot fakes much more easily.

The competition is open to anyone who wishes to enter, irrespective of how old they are or where they are from, the Treasury said. All entries must be submitted by October 30.

According to the rules of the competition, the denomination 'one pound' must appear as part of the overall design but it is left up to the designer precisely where this is placed.

Designs must not include a recognisable likeness of a known person, whether living or dead and designs must be the entrant's own work.

Artworks can be submitted in pencil, ink, paint or using computer drawing or design software, but three dimensional entries cannot be entered. All designs need to be presented on a template which can be downloaded from the Royal Mail's website.

People can enter more than one design if they wish, provided the entry is completed on the template, alongside a unique reference code which will be used to track the entry.

Giving tips to inspire competition entrants on its website, the Mint says designs should 'symbolise the UK in a clear and unambiguous way'.

It says: 'Whatever you choose as your inspiration, it must be readily understood to represent Britain.

'Think of symbols, heraldry, words, aspects of the natural world, man-made structures such as buildings and monuments, British achievements, whether social, political or cultural, and British institutions.'
