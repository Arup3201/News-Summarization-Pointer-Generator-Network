Sci-fi fantasy figure: Guitarist Cory Smoot as his stage character Flattus Maximus

'Talented': GWAR star Cory Smoot who had been with the band nine years

Lead singer Dave Brockie, known 
as 'Oderus Urungus,' said in a statement: 'It is with a sense of profound loss that  GWAR must announce the passing of their long-time guitarist and beloved friend Cory Smoot, also known to thousands 
of metal fans worldwide as Flattus Maximus,'

'At this point we are just
 dealing with the loss of our dear friend and brother.

'Please give your thoughts and your prayers to Cory, his family, and all the people that love him.'

He described Smoot 'one of the most talented guitar players in metal today.'The GWAR bus was close to the Canadian border when the shock discovery was made.

The metal musicians, who dress up in 
alien costumes and spew fake blood and goo on fans, are on a
 six-week North American tour, which features three other bands - Every 
Time I Die, Ghoul and Warbeast.

They are  known for lampooning well known figures including Sarah Palin, Lady Gaga and Paris Hilton and singing vulgar lyrics.

Band manager Jack Flanagan said there were no details on funeral arrangements, but GWAR will still perform today at Edmonton Event Centre despite the tragedy.

Cory Smoot joined GWAR in 2002 and was the fifth guitarist to play the character of 'Flattus Maximus'.

He is known as the one 'True Flattus' being the person who portrayed the character for the longest time.

With his red face, white dreadlocks, dinosaur-head shoulder pads and reptile feet, he became a legend among metal fans.

His talent as a producer came in handy as he loaned his skills to the recording of the band's albums War Party, Beyond Hell, Lust in Space (where he did lead vocals on the track 'Release the Flies', and the bands latest album Bloody Pit of Horror.

Before GWAR, Smoot previously played with such acts as Misguided and Locus Factor and still played with Mensrea and his own solo project called the Cory Smoot Experiment.

The band was founded by Brockie in Virginia in 1984. It has released 13 studio albums and EPs.
