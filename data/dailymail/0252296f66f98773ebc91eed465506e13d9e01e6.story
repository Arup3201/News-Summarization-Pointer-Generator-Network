Pain: Rock fan Robert McIndoe killed himself after getting unbearable tinnitus from a rock concert

A heavy metal fan died after stabbing himself because of the debilitating tinnitus he developed from a rock concert, an inquest heard today.

Father-of-two Robert McIndoe, 52, battled to get treatment for the ringing in his ears as his life became a living hell for three months after he went to watch Grammy award winning ‘supergroup’ Them Crooked Vultures featuring Nirvana’s Dave Grohl, Led Zeppelin’s John Paul Jones and Josh Homme from Queens of the Stone Age.

The ringing noise left Mr McIndoe unable to sleep, considering making himself deaf, and wishing he was dead - but several times he was turned away by doctors who failed to communicate, assess him properly or realise the extent of his desperation, Southwark Coroner’s Court was told.

Southwark Coroner Dr Andrew Harris recorded an open verdict after he said he could not be sure he intended to take his own life, but he added: 'There clearly were failings in his care.

'The fact that this man repeatedly requested referrals and walked across London from hospital to hospital, paid for private consultation, was seen by the ear nose and throat (ENT) specialist and a clinical psychologist, but had not started three months after damage to his ears is a shameful reflection professional communication and access to services in the NHS.'

Amateur actor Mr McIndoe had been to see Them Crooked Vultures at Brixton Academy in south London last July and woke up with ringing in his ears.

Dr Harris added: 'He had been exposed to loud music in the past, but this time the tinnitus occurred and persisted.'

Mr McIndoe, a management consultant and a keen guitarist, visited his GP surgery three times for his 'unremitting tinnitus' and was referred to see an ear, nose and throat specialist at King’s College Hospital in south London, the hearing was told.

However, there were no specialists available and he was sent to St Thomas’s Hospital in south London instead where he was turned away before getting an urgent appointment at the Royal London.

Less than a fortnight before his death he attended A&E at Lewisham Hospital where he was given sleeping tablets and a doctor promised to fax his GP the following day to arrange for an appointment.

But when he visited the GP no and note had arrived, he told him he was 'feeling suicidal due to the tinnitus adversely affecting his life and his marriage.'

Mr McIndoe's wife Shirley McIndoe said: 'He was desperate that it was never going to change - he didn’t know if he could live like this.'

The day after the appointment, on October 19th, 2010, Mr McIndoe left a suicide note and took an overdose at the family home in Sydenham, south-east London but the attempt to kill himself failed and he was hospitalised.

He told a psychiatrist he would rather be 'deaf of dead'.

Dr Harris said: 'He said that what he wanted most of all was to go to sleep and not wake up, he wanted to die to stop the sound of the tinnitus.'

Mr McIndoe was released on October 22nd, 2010, and had seemed more positive, wanting treatment, but seven days later on October 29th he stabbed himself several times.

A family member who he had text to say 'remember old friends, think carefully before making decisions, and always think of the consequences' had gone to check on him when they found his naked bloodied body. He never started his combined ENT and cognitive behavioural therapy.

Derek Nicoll, head of clinical pathways at South London and Maudsley NHS Trust, admitted that there had been problems in the care - particularly in supervision and communication between the different agencies who treated him.

He said that audits of the service and new procedures had been put in place to ensure that the failures never occurred again.

The inquest heard that Mr McIndoe had also tried alternative therapies, including acupuncture, and even considered permanently deafening himself by having his auditory nerve cut.

Conor Dufficy, representing the family of the amateur actor, suggested that the coroner should find there had been neglect.

Mr Dufficy said: 'He had been suffering for some time from tinnitus and severe depression and overall the care and communication he received from various mental health bodies involved failed him and therefore may have contributed to his death.'

However, Dr Harris said that there was no evidence the failings caused his death and as the failings were individual and had been addressed he could make no recommendations for change.
