A door malfunction on an armored truck sent money flying everywhere on Interstate 270, prompting drivers to jump out of their cars and grab bundles of cash.

The incident happened shortly before 8 a.m. on Friday morning on the northbound lanes of I-270 near Route 80, in Urbana, Maryland, but it is not known how much money was lost.

The driver  had been driving in the far left lane of the interstate when a lock on a door of the Ford E-350 van malfunctioned and a huge bag of cash fell out, sending bills flying everywhere.

Eyewitnesses saw drivers abruptly stop their cars, jump out of their vehicles, and put their hands in the air to grab the notes, police said. 

Soon, so many drivers had stopped their vehicles  that they practically shut down the northbound lanes of the road.

However, no one was injured during the incident.

The armored truck is owned by Canada-based GardaWorld.

Police said the shocked truck driver pulled over to the shoulder and saw multiple vehicles had also stopped, with drivers picking up the money according to The Washington Post.

But when a fire department official arrived at the scene, drivers fled onto Route 80 with money, police said.

Return the cash: MD State police thanked one honest person for returning some of the money found

Greg Shipley, a spokesman with the state police said that when police officers arrived, there was practically no cash left.

He told The Washington Post: ‘By the time he gets over, cash is floating through the air.' 

‘Most, if not all the vehicles suddenly stopped with people’s hands raised in the air.’

‘Traffic came to a stop when all the motorists stopped to pick up the cash,’ he said. 

‘The cash was so quickly picked up by numerous motorists.’

Maryland State Police, assisted by a K-9 dog team, recovered just over $200 from the scene. 

Authorities have issued a warning to the drivers who grabbed the cash, urging them to turn in the money at Maryland State Police's Frederick barrack.

Police tweeted a 'thank you' to one honest motorist who did, in fact, turn in some of the money that he found on the I-270. 

However, those who don't return the cash could face theft charges if police learn their identities, authorities said.
