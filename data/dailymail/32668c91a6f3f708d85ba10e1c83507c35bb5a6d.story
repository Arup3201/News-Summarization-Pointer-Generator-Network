Power shift: German chancellor Angela Merkel raised the prospect of curbing Brussels' influence

Angela Merkel will back David Cameron’s call for the repatriation of powers from  Brussels to Westminster.

The German Chancellor yesterday announced she wants to encourage talks on whether the European Union should ‘give something back’ to member states this autumn.

In a major boost for the Prime Minister, Mrs Merkel said: ‘We don’t have to do everything in Brussels.’

She signalled that she wants negotiations to begin after next month’s German general election.

Mr Cameron has said he will renegotiate the UK’s relationship with Brussels before holding an in-out referendum in 2017.

The Mail can reveal that Mrs Merkel has privately signalled to Tory Eurosceptics that she wants to do a deal to help Mr Cameron to help him get what he wants so that Britain stays in the EU.

Senior sources say she has assured Mr Cameron of her support as long as he does not force her to ‘choose between Britain and Europe’.

Mrs Merkel has opened a secret back channel to Tory MPs who are working with the Foreign Office to draw up a list of demands for the renegotiation.

She sent an envoy from her Christian Democrat party to talk to members of the 100-strong Fresh Start group of MPs – and he promised to support the UK as long as their proposals do not involve changing EU treaties.

Fresh Start, which includes influential backbenchers Andrea Leadsom, Dominic Raab and George Eustice, has visited Berlin and is planning further trips to European capitals to pave the way for renegotiation.

A senior member said: ‘Angela Merkel 
sent an envoy from her party to speak to Fresh Start. We were given the 
explicit message that she had seen what we were proposing and could 
support it.’

A source in Berlin said while they 
were not in favour of ‘re-opening existing treaties’ they were in favour
of handing back power from Brussels to national and regional 
government.

In an interview yesterday Mrs Merkel 
made clear that EU regulation has gone too far and that small numbers of
member states ought to be able to do deals together, without the need 
for the whole EU to sign up.

On German TV, she said: ‘I believe 
that in Europe at the moment we have to take care to coordinate our 
competiveness more closely. (But) we don’t have to do everything in 
Brussels.
‘We can also consider whether we can give something back.’

Mrs Leadsom said: ‘It’s no surprise 
that Andrea Merkel backs repatriation. The Fresh Start trip to Berlin, 
and meetings with German officials in London made clear that they see 
keeping Britain in the EU as a top priority.

‘They also see EU competitiveness as vital and recognise that  it has made itself too cumbersome.’
Among the ideas being  proposed by Fresh Start is an emergency brake on 
future EU legislation that affects the City and a scaling back of the 
EU’s powers over employment and social legislation.

Sources suggest Britain could secure a
partial or complete opt-out from the Working Time Directive as the 
price for supporting further harmonisation of the Eurozone economies.
