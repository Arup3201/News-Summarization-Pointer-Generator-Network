Elizabeth Hurley’s wedding to Shane Warne is back on after their temporary split – which The Mail on Sunday  can reveal was sparked by the discovery of a mysterious mobile phone among the  ex-cricketer’s luggage.

A source revealed that Liz, 48, was hurt and angry after she found the mobile as Shane was packing for a trip to his native Australia.

It is understood to have contained intimate text messages.

Back on: Elizabeth Hurley and Shane Warne's wedding is going ahead after their tenporary split, which was caused by intimate messages found on the Australian cricketer's mobile phone

The source explained: ‘The row between them was a bad one after Elizabeth came across a mobile phone.

‘When she took a look there were things which made her a bit suspicious – including some text messages to people she didn’t know.

‘But everything has been glossed over now – Elizabeth has forgiven him. They’re  very happy as a couple and desperate to make things work.’

Split: Warne, pictured arriving at for Nutcracker on Ice at The London Palladium in London last week, landed in hot water when Liz, 48 found the phone while he was packing for a trip to Australia

Sources close to the couple say they are keen to get the plans for the big day finalised as soon as possible.

The pair broke up in September, two years after they got engaged, with reports blaming their hectic schedules and long periods apart.

There were also claims that Shane, 44, may have grown close to his ex-wife Simone, 43, which were furiously denied.

Forgiven: Liz, pictured going to the same performance, has now glossed over the relationship issues and the couple are 'desperate to make things work'

Simone, the mother of Shane’s three children, said she is happy with her new boyfriend and insisted: ‘There are definitely no feelings there. Shane and I gave it a good shot and we’re much better the way things are as friends.’

Shane is no stranger to phone controversy. In 2000 an erotic text message scandal cost him his vice-captaincy of the Australian team. In 2006 pictures were published of the spin-bowler with two models, along with explicit messages he allegedly sent to them.

And a year later Simone left Shane in England and returned to Australia after he sent her a text meant for another woman.

Representatives for Shane and Liz’s declined to respond to the new claims yesterday.
