A huge online search is underway to find the owner of a missing wedding ring found in a Premier League car park in 2012.

An army of 100,000 people have now joined the hunt, ahead of the owner's 25-year wedding anniversary next year.

The search, led by Sunderland fan Clare Owens, began after the latter found the engraved ring in the club car park at the Stadium of Light.

The ring has engraving on the inside showing that the couple's 25-year anniversary is next June

The Black Cats were playing host to Norwich City in the fixture on February 1, 2012, and it is unclear whether the ring belongs to a supporter of the home or away side.

There has been a huge response since the incident, and now over 100 countries are involved in the search for the ring.

Next year will mark the 25th wedding anniversary of the unknown couple, shown by the engraving on the inside of the jewellery. 

The inscription, 'AJ á SC 16-06-1990' is the only clue to revealing the owner, but nobody has come forward to claim it as their own. 

The search is now being ramped up to find the missing owner ahead of their big anniversary date
