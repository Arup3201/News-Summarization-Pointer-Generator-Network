A video maker from Peterborough captured some incredibly eerie footage of a disused RAF station in Upwood.

Daniel Munns, a Lincoln University graduate, travelled to the Cambridgeshire station with a Phantom 2 DJI drone and a GoPro camera.

He was drawn to the location because he was bored of filming the fields around where he lives and after purchasing a drone believed the station would be an interesting place in which to capture some unique footage.

Helped by his friend Sean Young, who drove the pair to the location, Daniel squeezed through a hole in a fence and spent an hour filming and an additional nine hours editing once home.

Looking back on the project, Daniel, who was merely testing out his new equipment on the day, admitted he was ecstatic with the final product.

He said: ‘It had been a bit trial and error at first as I don’t have a monitor for the drone so I was flying blind.

‘I was just holding certain shots and hoping they would come out okay. When I got back and saw the outcome though I was buzzing.

After squeezing through a fence, Daniel captured some truly atmospheric footage of the abandoned RAF base

'I knew for sure that the drone had been a good purchase.’

The video itself is both chilling and mesmerising and captures the abandonment of the place in all its eerie glory.

Opening on a shot of tall trees, the footage fades into a birds-eye view of the abandoned RAF station.

Unsettling music accompanies the clip throughout as the drone moves slowly around the area capturing it entirely.

Footage of the buildings up-close show the extent of the deterioration that has taken place since the base was closed

Daniel was only testing his GoPro camera and drone but was ecstatic with the final outcome nevertheless

Royal Air Force Station Upwood is a former  non-flying station.

It was under the control of the United States Air Force from 1981, and one of three RAF stations in Cambridgeshire used by the United States Air Forces in Europe.

In 1994 the station was closed by the Ministry of Defence and most of it was vacated with the land and buildings being sold off to civil ownership.

Daniel explained that the size of the abandoned place was overwhelming and that this helped influence his decision to depict it in a spooky way.

He said: ‘It was eerie being in there so it only felt right to edit it in the way that I did.’

The drone then stalks a man (Daniel’s friend Sean) walking through the isolated landscape before ascending over his head.

The footage then fades into arguably the best shot of the piece – a vantage point that captures the sun breaking through miserable clouds, and the trees appearing as silhouettes.

Featured in the film is Daniel's friend Sean, whose presence adds another spooky element to the piece

Also featured in the shot is the building’s darkened, empty windows as well as a row of them in the distance that appear to look like a series of letters.

Faster footage of the buildings follow and a close-up shot of one of the entrances show the depreciation that has taken place.

Sean again features – standing in one of the windows – giving the piece another strange and spooky element.

Daniel admitted however that his intention had been to use someone dressed in military uniform so as to provide an even ghostlier edge, but stated that he does intend to do a follow up piece at a later date.

Daniel took a total of nine hours to edit the footage of the station after filming it for an hour with a drone

‘I felt I could have done a lot better if I had planned it,’ he said. ‘But for test footage I was chuffed to bits with it.’ 

Daniel studied Media Production at university, with a focus on film and TV, script writing and film production.

He has recently started a media company called ShotSightMedia, where he uploads videos of his work.
