Police in Michigan have released a surveillance video of a vehicle that may have been driven by a suspect in the disappearance of a mother who vanished as she worked the night shift at a gas station.

Jessica Heeringa, 25, who has a three-year-old son, was finishing her shift at an Exxon gas station in North Shores on Friday night when she apparently disappeared, leaving her purse and car behind.

The video, shot from the nearby Old Homestead Tavern, shows a minivan that witnesses told police had been in the area around the same time that Ms Heeringa went missing.

Norton Shores Police Chief Dan Shaw 
admits that the video leaves much to be desired in terms of hard-hitting evidence, 
but they're hopeful that releasing it could help unlock the 
mystery.

Appeal for information: Police and the family of Jessica Heeringa, 25, are appealing for information after she disappeared from a gas station in Michigan on Friday night

Mystery: This bar surveillance video shows a Chrysler Town & Country minivan that is believed to have been at the gas station around the time of Jessica Heeringa's disappearance

Chief Shaw told WOOD-TV:
'I wish I had the technology like you see on TV where you can blow it 
up and I can see the driver inside, but that doesnâ€™t exist for me.'

He told the station that the vehicle appears to match the Town & Country minivan seen by witnesses in the area prior to Ms Heeringa's disappearance.

Wanted for questioning: On Tuesday, police released a sketch of the suspect that they believe was driving the minivan

Authorities are now looking to question its driver, described as a 'heavyset' white male, between 30 and 40 years old.

Later on Tuesday, police released a sketch of the suspect.

Police suspect that she may have been familiar with her abductor.'

'There is no sign of a struggle in the store, so it's possible she knew who the person was as a customer or as an acquaintance,' Chief Shaw told ABCNews.

Authorities were alerted on Friday night when a worried customer called about the unattended gas station at 11:15pm.

That customer, Craig Harpster, said he came to the gas station like he normally does after work, and noticed that no one was there.

After looking around and finding no one, he told WOOD-TV that he had a 'gut feeling that something bad had happened' and called police.

Mr Harpster's 911 call was also released by authorities over the weekend.

In the call, he tells the dispatcher:
'There's nobody here. Um... it wouldn't allow me to pump gas. I just 
walked inside, there's nobody. There's a car here. There's another car 
out front. But it's just very suspicious why there's nobody here.'

Vanished: The mother-of-one disappeared from this gas station and police are now treating the case as an abduction

Ms Heeringa made her last sale at 11pm.

The missing girl's family made a
heartfelt plea for information on Sunday as police reclassified her 
disappearance as an abduction.

In
a press conference on Sunday morning, Chief Shaw said officers were 
treating the case as abduction after examining evidence at the scene.

No money was stolen from the gas station and it appeared that Ms Heeringa had left cleaning supplies on the counter.

Police described Heeringa as a white female, 5'1 tall, approximately 110 lbs., with blonde shoulder length hair, and blue eyes.

Help: Police described Heeringa as a white female, 5'1 tall, approximately 110 lbs., blond shoulder length hair, and blue eyes

Jessica is also known to wear wire rim glasses. She may be wearing a blue collared shirt saying 'Sternberg Exxon.'

The gas station has no surveillance cameras so police are relying on public information for help in the investigation.

'I'm sure she was abducted,' Ms Heeringa's mother told Michigan Live. '[There was] no struggle. She was cleaning a machine, she left her car keys, [and] no money was taken from the gas station.'

The
anguished family were praying for Jessica's safe return. 'She's loved 
by everyone,' her mother said. 'She has a 3-year-old boy who is missing 
his mom and wants her back.'

Derek Antol, a regular customer at the station, told Michigan Live, that he was 'dumbfounded' by the incident.

'I didn't know her, I didn't even know her name until this,' Antol said. 'But she was always very sweet, friendly gal.'

Antol said he is offering a reward of $500 for tips that lead to an arrest. 'I would hope if it was my kid people would show up here to support me,' he added. 'I am very surprised that people aren't here.'
