Two people are dead and one remains hospitalized in Kentucky, after a man who discovered his wife was cheating rammed into her new boyfriend's truck, shot the man and his estranged wife and then turned the gun on himself.

Police in the tiny town of Dry Ridge say that Shaun Hiles, 35, ambushed wife Nicole, 33, when she arrived in a house with another man, 32-year-old Larry Whiteker, about 11pm on Monday.

As they tried to flee, Shaun chased them down a country road and rammed his SUV into the back of Whiteker's pick-up truck, causing it to spin sideways.

Police in Kentucky say that Shaun Hiles rammed into the car driven by his wife Nicole's new boyfriend, Larry Whiteker, and shot them both dead once the cars stopped spinning

Shaun pulled out a handgun and shot Nicole to death, police say.

He got out of the car with another weapon, a rifle, and fired several rounds on Whiteker, killing him.

Shaun
 then shot himself on the stomach and chest, but was still alive when 
cops arrived at the scene. He was airlifted to the University of 
Cincinnati Hospital and listed in critical condition, according to WLWT.

Sheriff 
Chuck Dills, of Grant County, said Nicole had visited him earlier in the
 same day and asked for an emergency restraining order because Shaun was
 'bothering her,' WXIX reported. A judge was expected to have signed the order the same night the shooting took place.

Spurned: On Facebook, Shaun Hiles posted grim warnings about what he expected out of separating his wife Nicole

'They'd 
been separated — she had been trying to away from him,' said Dills, 
whose deputies had been to the Hiles' home on several domestic calls 
before, to WKRC.

'He was chasing after them due to the fact that his wife was with someone else,' he told local stations.

Earlier the day of the shooting, Nicole Hiles asked Sheriff Chuck Dills for an emergency protective order because her husband had been 'bothering her.'

On Facebook, Shaun posted several times about discovering his wife's infidelity — and gave out grim warnings about what might come next.

'The moment when you check your cell phone bills and you catch your wife cheating on you priceless,' posted on Thursday.

Then next day, he wrote, 'The war has began!!!!!!! [sic]'

If he survives, Shaun is expected to be charged with two counts of murder.
