India want the West Indies to pay nearly $42million (£26.2m) compensation for pulling out of their tour in October, it is claimed.

A dispute over players’ contracts resulted in the West Indies going home with an ODI, a Twenty20 and three Tests still to play.

In a letter to the West Indies Cricket Board, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is reputed to have said, that as a result of the action: ‘The BCCI is faced with huge revenue losses, a loss of reputation and is at risk of losing valuable commercial partners.

‘The consequences of cancellation of a committed home Tour during the biggest festival season Diwali is a monumental disaster for the BCCI.

‘Pending resolutions of all disputes the BCCI suspends all bilateral cricketing relations with the WICB.’
