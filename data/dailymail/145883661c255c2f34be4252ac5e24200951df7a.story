When he set up a website for history buffs, Mick Twomey probably expected to make new friends.

Instead he attracted a knife-wielding stalker who waged an extraordinary five-year hate campaign against him.

Dennis Gooding, 66, published Mr Twomey’s personal details online and even confronted his girlfriend at her workplace.

Last night the affluent former businessman began a one-year prison sentence after ‘obsessively’ targeting his victim despite a series of arrests.

The abuse culminated when Gooding uploaded a photograph of himself snarling and brandishing a large blade at his throat.

Mr Twomey, 63, was left so terrified by the ordeal that he sought counselling, and eventually fled the market town of Long Eaton, Derbyshire, to escape Gooding.

The retired crime scene investigator manages Nottstalgia.com, a genealogy and history website which has attracted thousands of members from across the world. He banned Gooding from the site after he left abusive and derogatory comments in 2009.

Gooding then began to bombard Mr Twomey with threatening messages, and even posted his car registration and telephone numbers online. The stalker also posted pictures of his victim’s face superimposed on a body dressed in Nazi uniform, and confronted his partner at her workplace.

Mr Twomey initially struggled to get colleagues from his old force, Derbyshire Police, to investigate. They eventually arrested Gooding twice but he escaped prosecution under ‘restorative justice’ procedures, which saw him simply apologise for his actions.

In 2011, after an inquiry by a neighbouring force, Gooding was convicted of harassment and given a 12-month conditional discharge and two-year restraining order.

Derby Crown Court jailed Gooding for one year and banned him from contacting Mr Twomey indefinitely 

It had little effect, and Derby Crown Court heard that the next year Mr Twomey moved house. A year later, Gooding was arrested after posting the dagger photo online and trying to arrange to meet Mr Twomey using a fake name. Under the picture he had written: ‘This could do some damage in the wrong hands … I’ll keep it, one never knows when it will come in handy.’

Mr Twomey said yesterday: ‘This has had a drastic effect on my life.

‘We fear he knows where we live [now] and will come after us again when he is out of prison.’ 

Gooding, who admitted breaching a restraining order and stalking, was banned from contacting Mr Twomey and his partner indefinitely.

PC Keeley Mansell, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: ‘There is still a limited awareness of stalking even though the problem is increasing with the use of social media.

‘Many people do not fully understand how frightening it is when it is happening to you.’

Mr Twomey added he was grateful to Jennifer Perry from the Digital-Trust, an organisation which assists those who are abused or tormented by others using digital technology.
