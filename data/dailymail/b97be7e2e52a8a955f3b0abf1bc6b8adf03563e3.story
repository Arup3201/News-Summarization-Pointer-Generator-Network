People in Scotland are more worried about independence than the rest of the UK, a new poll reveals.

More than half of Scots plan to vote No in September’s referendum, with just a third ready to support going it alone.

But more Scots fear independence will weaken the pound, damage the economy and lead to spending cuts than voters in England and Wales. Half of Scots say a Yes vote would have a negative impact on them personally.

The new IpsosMori poll shows 57 per cent of people plan to vote No in the referendum, unchanged since September while support for the Yes campaign is down two points to 32 per cent

Men are much more likely to support independence than women, sparking warnings from the SNP that wooing the female vote is the biggest challenge ahead of September's referendum

Support for independence was highest among 25-34-year-olds (45 per cent) and lowest among the over-55s (28 per cent)

The survey also revealed stark differences in the views of voters depending on where they lived

First Minister Alex Salmond will use a major speech today to try to rescue his dream of independence.

He will claim Conservative Chancellor George Osborne made a ‘monumental error’ by ruling out allowing an independent Scotland to keep the pound.

However, polls show the co-ordinated warning from the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems in Westminster that a currency union would be blocked has not triggered the backlash in Scotland which Mr Salmond had hoped for.

A new IpsosMori poll shows 57 per cent of people plan to vote No in the referendum, unchanged since September. Only 32 per cent say they will vote Yes, down two points in five months.

Mark Diffley, director at Ipsos MORI Scotland said the ‘No’ campaign appears to retain a healthy lead.

‘The important recent debate over currency appears not to have shifted committed voters from their positions while undecided voters appear a little more inclined to vote ‘No’ as a result.

‘Having said that overall support for a ‘No’ vote has not changed since December. We are now into the final 200 days before the referendum takes place and both sides will be stepping up their efforts to win over those who yet to decide how they vote. Time will tell whether this has significant impact on public attitudes.’

Scots are far more fearful about the impact of independence on the pound

Independence would damage relations between Edinburgh at the rest of the UK

The UK's position on the world stage would be diminished if Scotland goes it alone

Almost half of Scots fear more spending cuts in Scotland in the event of a Yes vote, compared to a quarter of people in England and Wales who fear the impact on spending south of the border

Almost half of Scots think independence will have a negative affect on them personally

More than half of voters across the UK fear independence will have a negative impact on the Scottish economy

Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond will use a speech tonight to claim Conservative Chancellor George Osborne made a ‘monumental error’ by ruling out allowing an independent Scotland to keep the pound.

Additional polling reveals the growing anxieties among Scots about the impact of independence on their lives.

More than half – 52 per cent – of people in Scotland fear a yes vote would weaken the pound, compared to only 32 per of people in England and Wales, the Guardian reported.

On spending, 49 per cent of Scots fear independence would trigger cuts in Scotland, while only 24 per cent in England and Wales predict more austerity south of the border.

Almost two thirds of Scots (63 per cent) fear that independence would lead to a worsening relationship between Edinburgh and the rest of the UK. Only 50 per cent of voters in England and Wales feel the same.

Nicola Sturgeon, Deputy First Minister, warned winning over women voters is the biggest challenge facing independence campaigners

Mr Salmond will use his speech today to accuse Mr Osborne's of ‘dive bombing’ Scotland with threats over the currency and the economy.

In a lecture hosted by the New Statesman in London tonight he is expected to say: ‘In the last three weeks people in Scotland have seen an array of approaches from the UK Government - what they apparently call their Dambusters strategy. We were love-bombed from a distance by David Cameron, then dive-bombed at close range by George Osborne.

‘I believe George Osborne's speech on sterling three weeks ago, his sermon on the pound, will come to be seen as a monumental error.

‘It encapsulates the diktats from on high which are not the strength of the Westminster elite, but rather their fundamental weakness.

‘In contrast, we will seek to engage with the people of England on the case for progressive reform.’

However, Mr Salmond’s deputy Nicola Sturgeon has warned that winning over women voters is the biggest challenge facing independence campaigners ahead of the referendum.

The Deputy First Minister said that women take a far more pragmatic approach to the issues and conceded that the SNP had yet to convince the majority to back separation.

In a keynote speech, she said that women needed to be convinced that independence would make them better off but admitted that the argument had yet to be won.

The scale of the Yes campaign's task was starkly illustrated by the IpsosMori poll which showed that only 27 per cent of women back independence, compared to 38 per cent of men.

The survey also revealed that 59 per cent of women oppose independence, leaving Mr Salmond a major task with just over six months until the referendum.

Support for independence was highest among 25-34-year-olds (45 per cent) and lowest among the over-55s (28 per cent).

The survey also revealed stark differences in the views of voters depending on where they lived.

Among those living in the most deprived areas, 47 per cent backed independence, with 41 per cent against.

But in the least deprived areas, only 20 per cent would vote Yes while 71 per cent would vote No.
