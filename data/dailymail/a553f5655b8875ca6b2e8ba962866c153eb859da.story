It is one of the world's most renowned dinosaur fossil sites.

But on this occasion, visitors to Canada's Dinosaur Provincial Park were gripped by an entirely different phenomenon.

Instead, US-based photographer Andy Best and his friend Chad Kendrick unexpectedly found themselves enjoying unrivalled views of the spectacular Northern Lights dancing across the night sky. 

US-based photographer and cinematographer Andy Best and his friend Chad Kendrick travelled to Dinosaur Provincial Park in Alberta, Canada, where they shot the Northern Lights

Mr Best, from Shelley in Idaho, USA, had been on an assignment to photograph the park for travel company Travel Alberta earlier this month.

The pair had spent two weeks photographing Canada's scenery.

But the men were shocked when the famously unpredictable Northern Lights made a sudden and unexpected appearance.

The pair quickly raced to photograph the scene playing out above them, which is often regarded as one of the world's most striking natural phenomena. 

Mr Best said: ‘It was a moment I'll never forget - I sat in the dark, staring out at the final glow of the sunset.

‘Having just finished backing up footage from the day, I looked up at a massive glow in the sky.

‘I ran over to Chad and screamed “The Northern Lights” - we tossed everything in our jeeps and ran full speed into the Badlands, not really knowing when it might end.

‘Luckily, it went all night and I got to experience my first Northern Lights.’

The scientific term for the Lights is the aurora borealis. They can only be seen between September and March each year

Displays of the Northern Lights are notoriously unpredictable and cannot be forecast in advance

In addition to the absence of the Northern Lights appearing, visibility can often be reduced by cloud cover and light pollution from nearby towns

Displays of the Northern Lights occur when solar particles enter the Earth’s atmosphere and on impact emit burning gases that produce green, yellow and blue-coloured lights

Displays of the Northern Lights, whose scientific name is aurora borealis, occur when solar particles enter the Earth’s atmosphere.

On impact they emit burning gases that produce green, yellow and blue-coloured lights.

However, they are notoriously unpredictable and cannot be forecast in advance. 

The traditional places for optimum Northern Lights viewings are the northern reaches of Scandinavia, Finland, Iceland, Canada and Alaska.

The Lights themselves can only be seen between September and March each year. 

In addition to the absence of the Northern Lights appearing, visibility can often be reduced by cloud cover and light pollution from nearby towns. 

The Dinosaur Provincial Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site which is noted for its striking badland landscape - a type of dry terrain characterised by steep slopes and minimal vegetation

Mr Best now lives in Portland, Oregon and specialises in sport and outdoor photography.

The Dinosaur Provincial Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site which is noted for its striking badland landscape - a type of dry terrain characterised by steep slopes and minimal vegetation.

The canyons, ravines and gullies makes the landscape difficult to navigate.

The park is well known for being one of the richest dinosaur fossil sites in the world. 

Forty dinosaur species have been discovered at the park and more than 500 specimens have been removed and exhibited in museums around the globe. 

He added: ‘I'm a third generation photographer that's been making movies since before I can remember.

‘I grew up playing sports and spending as much time as possible in the outdoors. 

'After years creating relationships and grinding, I’ve been able to connect with various brands in the industry that support my endeavors.

‘I believe in life, love and the pursuit of adventure. It’s important to stay centered, but dream big.

‘I find passion in the people and world around me.

'It’s in my core to work hard and love others. Simple fact: life gives you what you put into it.

‘I’ve had the great opportunity to work with several brands this year. I put 30,000 miles on my Jeep working on travel campaigns.

‘From Goal Zero, Gerber Outdoors, Toyota, to Travel Alberta, and various other travel brands, it’s been a very productive year. 

'I’m excited for the future. 2015 is filled with several missions that I can’t wait for. So much more to come!’
