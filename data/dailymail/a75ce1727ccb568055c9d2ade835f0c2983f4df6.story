Tony Pulis has backed Graham Dorrans to fire Norwich into the Premier League.

The Scottish international, 27, joined the Championship side on Wednesday in an initial loan move which will turn permanent at a £3million cost in the summer.

Dorrans, who joined West Brom from Livingston in 2008, is expected to play a key part in Norwich manager Alex Neil's push for promotion.

The Scottish international has been a bit-part player for the Baggies and was looking for first team football

Pulis said: 'Graham has been a great servant to this football club over seven years. The club paid a couple hundred thousand for him.

'I only worked with him for a short period of time and found him to be a very very good lad and also a very good professional.

'Norwich have got a good player and I’m sure he’ll help them get where they want to go, whether that is the play-offs or automatically prompted. Graham will certainly be an asset. Everything he did around the place was first class.’
