They are no strangers to an old fashioned feud, with plenty of experience from their own constant onscreen bickering.

So the cast of The Only Way is Essex knew exactly how to issue a low blow to their current nemesis, footballer Joey Barton, during an ongoing war of words on Twitter.

Taking a break from recording their Christmas charity single in London this afternoon, the cast posed for a rude photo mocking the 29-year-old sportsman.

'Jel Joey': The cast of TOWIE mocked footballer Joey Barton today by posting this picture on Twitter

While the reality stars are almost always engaged in some argument at any one time within their group, they banded together yesterday to take on the footballer after he launched a scathing attack on them.

The cast, including Joey Essex, Lydia Bright, Sam and Billie Faiers, Chloe Sims and Maria Fowler, held their pinky fingers up for the camera.

Mario Falcone went one further, gesturing with his middle finger, while Nanny Pat held a sign that read 'Jel (slang for jealous) Joey Barton.' Members of the group then posted the snap on Twitter.

Boys will be boys: Barton took a break from the feud he sparked on Twitter on Monday night to go paintballing

The move only reignited Barton's rant last night, with the QPR player targeting other celebrities and fans who waded into the fight to support the TOWIE gang.

'Isnt it quite obsurd (sic) that all these z-listers stick up for each other regardless of the show their on? Must think it'll get them a Daz advert,' he wrote.

After lashing out at a number of Twitter users, he ended his tirade with: 'Right people time to leave u. Take the high ground, there's a Z-list lynch mob outside burning pitchfolks with Asda t shirts on.'

Charity single: The cast spent the day recording a cover of Last Christmas

Meanwhile, the TOWIE cast got back to work on their charity single, filming the video in a West London studio.

James 'Arg' Argent announced the news on Twitter. He wrote yesterday: 'The Only Way Is Essex Have officially recorded a Charity Xmas Single covering Wham's “Last Christmas”! Gona be so funny #Towie4XmasNo1 !!!!!'

The reality stars were dressed up in red, white and gold to perform the hit song, with crooner Argent as their leader.

Break: Gemma Collins and Chloe Sims were spotted dressed to the nines outside the studio during a break from recording the single

Long day: Joey was seen arriving at the studios in casual wear, while co-star Mario Falcone was pictured leaving hours later

They weren't letting the attack from Barton dampen their holiday spirit as they belted out the hit song, which will be released on the charts in time for Christmas.

The war of words began last night shortly after Barton attended the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 launch party along with several members of the TOWIE gang.

Rather than keep to himself and enjoy a night off from the day job, Barton, who doesn't exactly have the best reputation himself, launched a barrage of digs in their direction.

Party season: Frankie Essex wore a red satin frock and leopard heels, while Nanny Pat was lovely as ever in a white dress

But, rather cowardly, he didn't 
actually put them down to their face - but decided to rant about them on
his Twitter page instead.

He
started by noting that his fellow guests were a bunch of 'strange 
z-list celebs' and added: 'Just for the record the TOWIE helmets were 
there, all of them together. FREAKS.'

But TOWIE's James 'Arg' Argent was having 
none of it and responded: 'Only person there that everyone looked down 
on is u. Should we beat our TOWIE cast mates up & go down for you to
like us!? Mug!'

Barton replied: 'Leave it u stonehenge teeth. Cheeky man giving it bigguns, leave it large undies.'

Uncalled for:  Barton attended the launch of Call of Duty: MW3 in London last night where he saw the TOWIE stars, including James 'Arg' Argent, which sparked his scathing Twitter attack

Arg's best friend and fellow TOWIE star Mark Wright wasn't at the computer game launch as he had dinner plans with his family.

But that didn't stop him getting involved as he took to his Twitter page to defend his friend and put Barton in his place.

He wrote: 'Joey where can I get ur hair cut ? Also u no that arg wants he's teeth done so thanks 4 watching the show!!'

Barton replied: 'Same place u get them speedo's. Ur sister still collecting footballers like panini stickers???'

Didn't want to say it to their face? Barton's Twitter feed shows some of the insults directed at Argent and Wright

Online rant: Barton's digs continued long after Wright, Essex and Argent signed off

Mark laughed it off and wrote, 'Is 
that all you got haha. Good night silly nuts', but Barton got angry and 
decided to insult Mark's grandmother instead, telling him: 'Nanny pat 
same knashers as that white horse u rode in on.'

Still
determined not to rise to it, Mark concluded: 'Haha u even know the 
white horse I rode in on. U must b watching. @joey7barton #TOWIE no1 
fan! Last message I waste on u, u complete lunch.'

Joey Essex also decided to tell Barton off and wrote on his Twitter page, 'Go to bed mate, it's 1 in the morning', but Barton told him: 'Don't u start. Go and tell that bird u love her and get a massive "nice guy" jog on.'

Fighting back: Wright wasn't going to let Barton insult his friends and family - but also rose above it by trying to laugh it off

Mark and Joey then signed off the row
and refused to get drawn into it further but Barton would not let it 
lie and carried on making nasty remarks about the cast and the show.

He
wrote: 'TOWIE firm don't mess with big boys, u and ur shallow, fake, 
pretentious lifestyles. In a year u'll be opening sh***y poundshops if 
ur lucky.

'FYI- TOWIE retards....."Pretentious" google it if ur struggling......Off to bed, keep me updated people with the TOWIE blerts, all thats wrong with the world that mob, I'll take great pleasure in abusing them.'

You tell him, Arg! The crooner tried to put Barton in his place on his Twitter page

Award-winning: Arg points out that TOWIE has won a prestigious gong

One step further: Arg then posted a picture poking fun at Barton's hairstyle

Arg couldn't resist one last attempt to shut Barton up before signing off and wrote: 'Someone looks like they've watched the 
show more then we have! Night #TOWIE fans! Wanna put us down? All we 
need to say is one word.. BAFTA!'

But that wound Barton up even further, 
and he added: 'Told u to leave didn't I, right fatty now ur fair game. 
Can't believe ur giving it with them teeth like a burnt down fence.

'I actually despise the whole of that 
firm, mentally deficient, turn up at the opening of an envelope, fame 
hungry, prized b*** bags.'

He wouldn't let it lie: Barton kept digging at the TOWIE gang long after he left the party

Barton, who has been described as one of the dirtiest players in the Premiership, has twice been convicted of violence, the first in May 2008 when he was sentenced to six months' imprisonment for common assault and affray after he was caught on CCTV in Liverpool knocking a man to the ground before straddling him and punching him four or five times as his cousin threw food at the victim.

Minutes later Barton attacked a 16-year-old boy and left him with broken teeth and served 77 days of the prison term.

In July 2008, he was given a four month suspended sentence after he pleaded guilty to a violent attack on Manchester City teammate Ousmane Dabo during a row at the club's training ground.

This effectively finished his career at the club where, four years earlier, he stubbed a lit cigar out on the eye of teammate and youth player Jamie Tandy and was fined six weeks wages, which amounted to about £60,000.

Thug: Barton is known for his violent outbursts on the pitch too and is seen here squaring up to Arsenal's Gervinho during one of his last games for Newcastle before he moved to QPR this summer
