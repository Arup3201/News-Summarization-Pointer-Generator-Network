A mother-of-one says she is 'devastated' as a new roundabout has permanently blocked access to her new £20,000 driveway.

Ksenia Martin says she knew about the £150 million project to widen the A453 outside her home in Clifton, Nottinghamshire, but says she did not realise that the planned roundabout would block her drive permanently.

Retired Mrs Martin, who spent £20,000 landscaping and re-paving her garden and driveway, says she has been left devastated by the news.

The £150 million roundabout blocks Mrs Martin's brand new driveway - she now has to park around the corner

Mrs Martin has repeatedly tried to sell the house but says she has found no buyers because of the development of the roundabout just yards from her front door.

She says she was not aware of the plans before she bought the house, and says the solicitor did not flag them up to her.

She says she would never have bought the house  - or spent the money renovating the driveway if she had known.

She said: 'I'm devastated - I've spent a lot of money on the driveway, having it re-paved and also having six-foot gates put up.

'There was a leaflet shoved through the door telling me I wouldn't be able to park on my drive because of the building works.

'I got in touch with the number on the leaflet to see how long the road would be shut for and was told I wouldn't be able to use my driveway again.'

The Highways Agency says it has provided a small parking area which Mrs Martin has a permit to use but it is 200 yards away from her front door.

As a result, the retired housing scheme manager says she feels isolated and vulnerable.

Mrs Martin said: 'Since the work started nobody comes to visit me - family and friends just can't get near the house without a permit.

'Because I can't carry more than two or three bags from the car to the house I'm having to do three trips to the shops instead of one.

'What I'm most concerned about though is if I fall ill or there's a fire.

'An ambulance or fire engine couldn't get close enough to the house and I'd have to be dragged through the street.'

Even once the roadworks are completed, the entrance to her house will not be accessible and she will have to continue parking around the corner.

Her home is part of a two-house mini cul-de-sac and the entrance will be permanently closed from now on.

Mrs Martin, who bought the house for  £107,000 in June 2011, put her home up for sale in April to try and get away.

Four days after advertising her home for £130,000 it sold, but because of the development of the roundabout the sale fell through and she has been unable to find a buyer since.

She said: 'I've had another eight viewings but once they took one look at the roadworks they turned round.

'I was just wasting my time, so I gave up. I would move house tomorrow if I could.'

Mrs Martin says she has not received any compensation.

Daughter Lisa Eden, 36, who lives further down Farnborough Road, said: 'It's very frustrating.

The 36-year-old said: 'I don't live that far away but if I'm on my way back from somewhere in the car, I can't just pop into my mum's.

'It's also been very upsetting for me to see how distressed my mum has been.

'She feels very isolated and she definitely doesn't get as many visitors anymore.'

A spokesman for the Highways Agency said: 'The Highways Agency sympathises with Mrs Martin's predicament. We have worked with her to try and find a potential solution.

'We've explored the possibility, with Nottingham City Council, of whether a new access to the driveway could be provided from the side of the house but this was not possible.

Mrs Martin spent £20,000 landscaping and re-paving her garden and driveway - but will not be able to use them

'A car park for residents has been provided next to Mrs Martin's house, which she now uses.

'As with any scheme, it is standard practice for the Highways Agency to engage with stakeholders on plans and carry out a thorough public consultation before plans are finalised.

'Plans were in place when Mrs Martin purchased the property and local searches and plans indicated the impact the A453 scheme would have had on the property.'
