A man with one arm has been told he cannot have a disabled parking permit - unless he loses another limb.

Roy Sowerby, 58, was refused a blue badge for his vehicle by Middlesbrough Council 'because he has two legs'.

The father-of-five has been registered as disabled since losing an arm after it was crushed in an industrial accident 11 years ago.

'Not disabled enough': Roy Sowerby, 58, was told by Middlesbrough Council that he would need to lose another limb to qualify for a Blue Badge parking permit 

He has used a Blue Badge permit for his car for the last three years but when he recently went to renew it, he was told he no longer qualified.

Mr Sowerby, from Middlesbrough, finds pushing a shopping trolley extremely challenging and claims he needs to park closer to the supermarket to make it easier.

He said: 'I'd like the council to tell me how I am not disabled. They said if I lost another arm or a leg then I would qualify for one.

'So do I have to cut off my legs or my arm or my head to qualify for one? 

'They said I can't have one because I can carry a bag but I can't carry anything bulky or heavy or big.'

The Blue Badge scheme allows drivers to park in spaces closer to their destination and is recognised in most European countries.

Outraged: The father-of-five is appalled that he is not able to renew the disabled parking permit after three years of using it

Middlesbrough Council said Mr Sowerby is no longer eligible under new rules drawn up in 2012 by the Department for Transport (DfT).

The authority said Blue Badges are issued for three years and applications for permits are 'required to undergo independent assessment to determine their eligibility'.

A spokesman said: 'Those applying for a discretionary Blue Badge must have a severe disability in both arms or a permanent and substantial disability that causes inability to walk or very considerable difficulty in walking.'

'The criteria for eligibility in the first instance are that the applicant has a severe disability in both arms, regularly drives an adapted or non-adapted motor vehicle regularly, and also considerable difficulty in operating parking meters.

New rules: Middlesbrough Council claim new rules introduced in 2010 require 'a severe disability in both arms or a permanent and substantial disability that causes inability to walk or very considerable difficulty in walking'

'To qualify for a Blue Badge all three criteria must be met. The DfT state that "in no circumstances should anyone who does not satisfy all three of the conditions set out above receive a badge".

'The guidance adds that "in particular, a badge should not be issued to a person who travels solely as a passenger or a person who has difficulty carrying parcels, shopping or other heavy objects such as luggage".'

In 2010, a woman with one leg was also told she was 'not disabled enough' to claim a blue badge, because she could walk with difficulty for more than 30 yards.

Julia Pearson, from Worcestershire, said at the time: 'It's made me feel pretty sick with it all, and it has upset me. I don't know what to do now.'
