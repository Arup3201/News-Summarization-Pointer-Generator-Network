Not so long ago, Tom Inskip was cruising along the freeway in California in a flashy convertible sports car. 

Nothing out of the ordinary about that, you might think. Except for one revealing detail: he was stark naked, his modesty preserved only by the steering wheel.

How do we know this? Because a picture of him in the nude subsequently appeared on a Facebook page. Perhaps, then, we should not be too surprised to learn, then, that ‘Skippy’ — as he is known to his friends — featured prominently in recent scandalous events in Las Vegas involving Prince Harry.

Harry's 'wingman': Tom Inskip, right, seems to feature prominently in Prince Harry's recent scandals as seen here in a swimming pool in Las Vegas

Last August Tom Inskip and Prince Harry were photographed partying on the island of Hvar, off the coast of Croatia, where the prince jumped into a pool fully-clothed

For Skippy is Harry’s best friend. Where Harry goes, ‘Skippy’ is usually not far behind. And vice-versa. 

He is often called Harry’s ‘wingman’. It is a misleading description. A ‘wingman’, in flying terms (Harry is a an Apache helicopter pilot), is a pilot who protects his colleague on dangerous missions by watching his back.

But Inskip seems often to perform the opposite role, enthusiastically accompanying, if not leading, his friend into trouble.

He was with Harry on his ill-fated trip to Croatia in August last year, when they got drunk on vodka, whisky, beer and tequila, and were photographed jumping into a pool fully-clothed at a nightclub on the party island of Hvar.

He was with him on a skiing trip to Verbier in November when they amused themselves by childishly hurling snowballs at unsuspecting passers-by from a balcony. 

He was with him at a party in 2010 when Harry was seen inhaling ‘hippy crack’ — otherwise known as nitrous oxide or laughing gas — a recreational drug which, although perfectly legal, has been associated with a number of fatalities.

And, of course, Skippy ‘Inskip’ — who at 25 is two years Harry’s junior — was in the thick of the action in downtown Vegas. 

He may not have appeared in those embarrassing shots of Harry playing ‘strip billiards’ in Room 2401 at the Encore Wynn Hotel. But he was undoubtedly there — off camera — with other members of Harry’s entourage, of which more in a moment.

Inskip, in between falling out of this or that nightclub in various parts of the world with Prince Harry, works in the City. His father is Owen Inskip, a field-master of Prince Charles’s favourite hunt, The Beaufort, who has made a fortune over the years from a number of businesses, including ‘managing’ thousands of council homes for local authorities and upmarket estates.

The family’s nine-bedroom country pile, Alderley Farm, near Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire, was sold for more than £7 million in 2007. 

‘Skippy’ and sister Victoria — ‘Tor’ to her friends — have known Princes William and Harry since childhood. The Inskips were regulars at Club H, the ‘nightclub’ William and Harry set up in the basement of Highgrove.

Victoria has been a fundraiser for Sentebale, the African charity set up by Prince Harry (ironically, it was holding a fund-raising event in California while he was ‘letting off steam’ in Vegas).

Her brother attended Eton with Harry and co-owns a race horse with him called Usain Colt. He is credited with organising Prince William’s stag party before his wedding to Kate Middleton. 

Earlier this year, Inskip was said to be dating flame-haired literary agent the Hon Lara Hughes-Young, 24, daughter of Lord St Helens. The couple recently jetted out to South Africa — without Harry — to stay with Harry’s ex-girlfriend, Chelsy Davy. 

It was a rare excursion without the Prince because, for the most part, Harry and Tom are inseparable. The following episode perhaps illustrates this.

Back in the days when scandal arrived at breakfast with the News of the World, the paper ran a front page ‘exclusive’ about Prince Harry. 

The gist of it was that he had a one-night stand with a foreign  student on a trip to the Swiss skiing resort of Klosters. The ‘revelation’ seems tame by comparison with recent events in Vegas.

Afterwards, however, sources discreetly suggested it was ‘Skippy’, not Harry, who had bedded the girl. So much for being his ‘wingman’.

Tom Inskip is also believed to have 
been in the group that accompanied Harry on a less well-publicised trip 
to Las Vegas late last year after a week of military training in 
California. The royal ‘hangover crew’ spent three days partying and 
gambling in Vegas. 

Needless
to say, it was Harry who appeared on the gossip websites. Photographic 
evidence of him flirting with a nightclub waitress was posted on the 
internet.

Then, as now, 
Harry and his pals stayed at the Encore Wynn Hotel, a gleaming back 
edifice in the heart of the Strip which houses four miles of bars, 
gambling halls, pole- dancing clubs and neon lights. 

Little wonder Vegas is also a favourite destination for many of our Premiership football stars.

So who else is in Harry’s drinking and partying gang?

Arthur Landon is certainly one of them. Landon, 30, inherited more than £200 million on the death of his father in 2007. Brigadier Tim Landon, an adventurer and arms dealer in oil-rich Oman, was known in life as the ‘White Sultan’.

Before flying to Vegas, Landon, Skippy and Burberry model Cressida Bonas, Harry’s most recent girlfriend, joined him for an equally wild tequilla-fuelled week on Richard Branson’s private island of Necker in the British Virgin Islands.

They certainly didn’t hold back during the 27th birthday celebrations of the tycoon’s son, Sam Branson.

Mr Landon offered friends a look inside his suitcase as he packed for the trip, which included Captain  Britannia and storm-trooper costumes, a gas mask and what appeared to be a purple bong — a device that can be used for smoking drugs. 

The contents were photographed and posted online. The accompanying caption read: ‘2x flip flops, 3x board shorts, 8x fancy dress outfits, 1x toothbrush, 10x awesomeness. Then he wrote: ‘Let the good times roll, let me roll, let me roll!!!’ 

Three days later, Ampleforth- educated Mr Landon posted another picture on Facebook of one of their group, who was wearing a pair of Bermuda shorts similar to those worn in Vegas by Prince Harry, apparently passed out in the sand, captioned: ‘The perfect start.’

Meanwhile, Miss Bonas provided an insight into the group’s riotous holiday, uploading a picture of  herself wearing a bright yellow bikini top and neon pink shorts, and matching pink wig.

Some members of the group, including Miss Bonas, returned to London. But a handful, including Skippy, Landon and Adam Bidwell, went with Prince Harry to ‘Sin City’. 

Keen Rugby player Bidwell was photographed in the Jacuzzi at the MGM Grand hotel with the Prince the following day and is a close pal of Harry’s one-time rumoured love interest, TV presenter Natalie Pinkham. He went to Natalie’s wedding in Portugal recently, which was also attended by Princess Eugenie and Zara Phillips.

Hours after Harry’s entourage arrived on Friday last week, they were to be found in the aptly-named Surrender nightclub — part of the Encore Wynn resort where they were staying, and where they invited a group of girls they met back to the ‘royal’ suite on the 63rd floor.

At the centre of proceedings, of course, was Prince Harry. Or should we call him ‘Harry Prince’? That is the name he jokingly used, by all accounts, during his now notorious 72 hours in Las Vegas.

The pictures revealing what had taken place appeared on TMZ, the American showbiz gossip website, which has now made a video poking fun at Prince Harry and the Queen, who is depicted in cartoon form chastising her grandson.

‘Poor show,’ her caricature screams, before ordering Harry to ‘apologise to the kingdom.’ It would be difficult to imagine a more embarrassing — or avoidable — fiasco in Her Majesty’s Diamond Jubilee year in which Prince Harry, who will shortly celebrate his 28th birthday, represented the Royal Family at the Olympics closing ceremony just a fortnight ago.

Speaking for the first time about the Vegas trip, Landon insisted none of Harry’s friends would have taken the photographs. 

‘I obviously think it is really despicable that someone would accept Prince Harry’s hospitality and then take these pictures,’ he said. ‘I know it has put a real dampener on everybody on that holiday.

‘Some people have been hinting it was one of his friends who took the pictures. But this is absolutely not true. None of his friends would ever do that. We are really careful.’

Either way, the game of ‘strip billiards’, was the prelude to non-stop drinking, flirting, and partying in which Harry’s friends attended two decadent pool parties, downed cocktails as they watched go-go dancers in skimpy bikinis gyrate around stripper poles, played dice game craps in the casinos and ran up a £30,000 tab in the process. 

Perhaps the only welcome news is that it didn’t cost taxpayers back in Britain a penny. The drinks, as they say, were on the house, courtesy of billionaire Steve Wynn, who owns the hotel.

Last Sunday morning, Harry could be spotted in the one of the lobby bars nursing three Bloody Marys. By his side, as ever, was Tom ‘Skippy’ Inskip. He is Prince Harry’s ‘wingman’, after all.
