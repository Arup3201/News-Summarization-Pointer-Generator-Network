Liverpool have had a £16million bid accepted by AC Milan for Italy striker Mario Balotelli.

Balotelli has been offered £90,000-a-week to move to Anfield and the transfer is nearly complete after a 'positive' first meeting on Thursday evening. The player's representatives will meet with Reds executives on Friday morning to thrash out a deal. 

Brendan Rodgers had said Liverpool would categorically not be signing the errant Italy striker last month, but has had a change of heart.

Balotelli earlier told Sky Italia: 'This will be my last day at Milanello.'

Later, he left Milanello training complex in a red Ferrari. He had lunch after training and stopped to tell reporters: 'Nothing is decided yet nothing is black and white.'

Former Liverpool striker Michael Owen posted on Sportslobster: 'Going to be great fun having Balotelli back in the Premier League. There is no doubt about his talent and I'm sure Brendan Rodgers will make sure he behaves having witnessed the problems (Luis) Suarez inflicted on the club. If that's the case, £16m looks good value.'

Samuel Eto'o is still an option for Liverpool should the Balotelli deal fall through, for any reason.

Balotelli has to be registered by noon on Friday if he is to figure for Liverpool against former club Manchester City on Monday.

It would be a sensational return to the Premier League for the 24-year-old, who left City in 2013.

Balotelli has been involved in a series of scrapes during his career to date, especially during his time in the Premier League. 

Striker: Balotelli scored 30 goals in 80 games for City before moving back to Italy

Flashpoint: Balotelli had a number of run-ins during his explosive relationship with Roberto Mancini

On the field, he was sent off for Manchester City against Arsenal in 2012 in a defeat that almost derailed their title charge.

And off the pitch, there was the notorious incident when Balotelli set off fireworks in his house, leading to him revealing the famous 'Why Always Me?' T-shirt when he scored in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford in 2011.

He also had a set-to with City manager Roberto Mancini on the training ground, and a scrap with Jerome Boateng.

The striker's agent Mino Raiola flew to England on Wednesday to try to thrash out a deal.

Since returning to Italy, he has scored 30 goals in 54 games, the same amount he scored for City in 80 games. 

And it is easy to forget that he has already won four titles in two countries, a Champions League and the FA Cup and Coppa Italia by the age of 24.
