Paul Murray admits the new Rangers regime is still waiting to see whether Mike Ashley will send two of his men onto the board.

The Ibrox interim chairman confirmed the terms of the initial £5million loan taken from Sports Direct by the previous hierarchy means Ashley retains the right to appoint directors.

Murray insists Rangers now have no need for any further money from the Newcastle United owner, having this week instead secured a £1.5m loan from the Three Bears consortium to cover short-term needs.

However, he hopes to have talks with Ashley once a wider review of existing commercial deals with Sports Direct – who own 75 per cent of the club’s retail subsidiary – is complete.

‘We’ve had no discussions with Mike Ashley or Sports Direct so far but, as we have said before, we are happy to engage with them and feel we should do,’ Murray told Rangers TV.

‘They are an eight per cent shareholder and have financial arrangements with the club. We need to have that conversation pretty soon, but as yet we’ve had no discussions with them.

‘Mike Ashley does have the right to nominate two board members. It would be to the main public company, the International Football Club, and he has got rights under the first £5m loan to do that.

‘He’s showed no intention of doing it so far but he has the right to do it if he wants to - and we’d have to address that if and when he chooses to do that.

‘I think, as Dave King was saying, one of the big information-gathering exercises was to look at the whole relationship between Sports Direct and the club.

‘There are a lot of relationships and there is a lot of documentation to go with those and we have spent the last three weeks looking at all of that.

‘We haven’t finished that review yet. I think once we have done that we will sit down, hopefully with Sports Direct and Mike Ashley, and try and agree a way forward.’

King has held off from becoming a director but intends to step into the chairman’s role providing he passes the SFA’s 'fit and proper’ person test.

‘The processes regarding both mine and Dave’s fit and proper persons test are pretty advanced,’ added Murray.

‘We have said, and we will honour the fact, that we want to rebuild the relationship with all the governing bodies and we have to respect their processes and procedures.’

Murray also insisted he wants to help build a ‘modern Rangers upon traditional foundations’.

He said: ‘People have spoken about having Rangers men on the board and getting back to a Rangers way of doing things but I think we also need to be a bit more forward-thinking.

‘I am looking a lot at this moment at the structure of various clubs and trying to get a sense of what would work at Rangers because there are different structures around Europe and even in Britain.

‘For example, the structure at Barcelona might not be appropriate for the structure at Rangers and we need to look at that kind of thing.’
