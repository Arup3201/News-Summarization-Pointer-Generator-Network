This is the shocking moment that a voyeur was caught spying on his female housemate as she watched television in the early hours of the morning.

A neighbour living opposite the Liverpool student house took these photos as the man lay outside the first-floor bedroom of 22-year-old Sam Walton.

The man, who was performing a sex act on himself while looking at Miss Walton, had climbed on to the roof in order to reach his position at her window.

He only moved when the neighbour shouted at him and disturbed him.

But the voyeur climbed back up just five minutes later and continued performing the sex act.

Concerned for Miss Walton, the neighbour's mother went over to the  house to warn the drama student what was happening.

Miss Walton was horrified to discover that she was sharing a house with the man, a foreign student, who was later recognised by the neighbours.

But despite phoning the police and giving them this set of photographs, the suspect was never charged and was allowed to return to his home country unpunished.

Miss Walton said police told her he was not being prosecuted because of a lack of evidence.

She said: 'The pictures is just haunting. I was just sitting there watching Breaking Bad in my pyjamas and while I heard a noise I didn't think anything of it.

'About 45 minutes I heard a knock at the door, and I answered and there was a middle-aged woman I didn't recognise.

'She asked if I was the girl who lived in the back bedroom on the first floor.

'I told her yes, and she said "My son has just woken me. There has been a man sitting on the roof outside your bedroom window."

'I freaked out. I was afraid whoever was out there might have climbed in through my open window while I answered the door, so I asked the lady to come up with me while I closed it.

'I also noticed footprints on the roof near my window. I arranged a house meeting, and naturally they were worried.

'When I saw the picture and saw how close he was, it made me think he had done it before.'

Miss Walton's boyfriend and parents urged her to immediately leave the student accommodation in Liverpool after the incident in April but she stayed, determined to catch the person responsible.

A few days later her neighbour's son went to check on her and recognised the man in the kitchen where he was sharing the house with Sam and three other students.

Miss Walton noticed that the markings on his distinctive trainers matched the footprints on her roof.

She added: 'He pulled me aside and told me he was 100 per cent sure that I was living with the guy that had done it because he recognised him when we were in the kitchen.'

Miss Walton then phoned the police but said it took them two days to take a statement.

She said the man - a foreign student - was arrested on suspicion of voyeurism but was released and allowed to return to his home country after 24 hours in custody.

She was later told the investigation was dropped because there wasn't enough evidence.

Speaking to student newspaper The Tab, Miss Walton said: 'Unfortunately, as you can see, the pictures weren't the best quality but you can see how close the man was.

Distinctive: Miss Walton, who continued to live in the house after the incident, said that the patterns on the soles of her flatmate's shoes matched the footprints she found on the roof outside her bedroom, pictured

'When they arrived the policewoman told me that, based on the statements and evidence we'd given, they felt they had enough to make an arrest.

'When they came to arrest him, they found clothes matching the descriptions and those seen in the photos.

'The whole situation was hellish, and now this pervert's got off scot-free. There are clearly some real weirdos out there, and what is worse is that the police didn't seem to care.

'Would they have waited until a violent crime had taken place before pursuing a conviction?'

Miss Walton, who is still living in Liverpool, added: 'This whole experience has certainly taught me a lesson.

'Don't take it for granted that people know what acceptable behaviour is and what is not.

'If nothing else, I'm now much more conscious of my personal safety, even of just keeping my blinds drawn all the time.

'I'm also a lot more wary of people, even those who at first seem OK.'

The alleged voyeur has since returned to the continent and did not respond to a request for comment.Â
