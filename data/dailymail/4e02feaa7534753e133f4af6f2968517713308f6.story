CCTV images released today show the moment a murderer withdrew cash from a millionaire's bank account months after he killed her in her flat in Marylebone, central London.

Rakesh Bhayani, of Wembley, north west London, was found guilty of murdering Carole Waugh at the Old Bailey.

He had admitted perverting the course of justice by concealing the death and also conspiracy to defraud.

Co-accused Nicholas Kutner, 48, Kentish Town, north west London, was found not guilty of murder, but guilty of perverting the course of justice by concealing the death. He had already admitted conspiracy to defraud.

A third defendant, Elie Khoury, 40, of Paddington, central London, was found not guilty of conspiracy to defraud.

Bhayani, 41, and Kutner, 48, were accused of killing Ms Waugh, who was described as a lonely woman who worked as an amateur escort.

Bhayani was Ms Waugh's 'boyfriend' who she met online and lent £40,000 to - but instead of repaying her he stabbed her to death.

The jury at the Old Bailey heard claims that they were professional conmen with gambling habits who killed the millionaire in April last year then went on to steal large sums of her money.

Miss Waugh sought excitement in sex with strangers and fabricating stories that hid the truth about her life, the jury heard.

After working in Libya she returned to the UK and began advertising herself on at least nine different dating websites.

Using the pseudonyms Sarah and 
'poshtottyfun', she described herself as 'not a professional but with 
girlfriend experience interested in lots of good clean adult fun.'

Dozens of men who responded to the adverts arrived at her flat to find her waiting at her door dressed only in a dressing gown.

Although many paid her between £100 and £200 for sex and never saw her again, she occasionally refused payment.

In some cases the men became long-term boyfriends. One of them would be Bhayani.

Her mistake was to trust Bhayani enough to lend him £40,000 after he showed her a bag full of 150,000 counterfeit Euros.

Bhayani's determination to avoid 
paying back the debt would eventually lead to him killing her and taking
over her identity to plunder her assets. 

'Mesmerising and beguiling' Bhayani 
even got Miss Waugh to visit him in prison and lent him cash for 
'treatment' for his gambling addiction.

She
had previously loaned him smaller sums after he told her he could 
double it in a betting opportunity - and he had always delivered.

He was setting her up to borrow a large sum he could never hope to repay - but Miss Waugh trusted him.

Millionairess Carole Waugh was stabbed to death in her flat and her body hidden in the boot of a car

Ms Waugh, 49, was stabbed in the neck in her flat in Marylebone, central London. The court heard her body was placed in a bag, which was carried to a car.

The vehicle was initially stored in a central London car park, then left in a rented garage in New Malden, south London.

By the time her body was found on 2 August her bank accounts had been stripped and her house put on the market.

Ms Waugh was a self-made millionaire who boasted of her connections with Colonel Gaddafi - but despite her claims of a colourful, was a doting aunt and daughter.

The millionairess was determined to make her fortune in London and moved there when she was 22.

Although
she revealed little of her work and life in the capital, her family 
believed she was mainly temping as an office worker.

By 1998 she had made enough money to buy the flat in Marylebone, west London, which is today worth more than £650,000.

Miss
Waugh spent the next ten years in Tripoli in Libya working as a payroll
clerk for Veba Oil on a tax-free salary of £25,000 a year and earned a 
reputation as a private woman who preferred to stay out late at night 
with the locals rather than her work colleagues.

The crime scene in New Malden, south west London where Miss Waugh's body was discovered

She
returned home when the political situation started to deteriorate and 
later wrote a letter to her boss Stuart Anderson claiming that she had 
been threatened by a senior figure in the government and feared for her 
life.

Ms Waugh made enough money to pay off 
her flat's mortgage and she could easily have got an ordinary job - but decided 
to mix business with pleasure, and began advertising herself on dating 
websites.

But her colourful personal life never
prevented her from regularly returning north to see her family 
including a niece she doted on and speaking to her mother every other 
day by phone.

At the time of her death they were talking about the arrangements for her 50th birthday celebration in June 2012.

Her
brother, acting on his mother's concerns about the lack of contact, 
first contacted police in late April and made a formal missing persons 
report at Penrith, Cumbria, on 7 May 2012.

But it was only when he discovered her bank account was empty that he knew for sure something was terribly wrong.

A court heard that before her death 
Ms Waugh boasted of being 'set up for life' thanks to her friendship 
with Colonel Gaddafi and his family in Libya.

Referring to her claims of friendship with Gaddafi, Mr Waugh added: 'The stories were embroidered and exaggerated to give an impression she was more successful than she was and happier than she was.'

She
told family and friends how she worked at a merchant bank and rubbed 
shoulders with Foreign Secretary William Hague and his staff.

As
well as constant namedropping, Ms Waugh was also not afraid to show off
her prized Cartier jewellery and expensive luxury cars.

But
in fact she was a spendthrift who hid £5,000 in cash in an airing 
cupboard at her flat, kept £50,000 in the bank, invested in shares and 
lived on the proceeds of the escort work she advertised on casual sex 
websites.

She proudly told her family how she 
discovered a vintage Chanel handbag worth hundreds of pounds being sold 
for £5 at a charity shop - and promptly haggled the price down to £3.50.

'That is instructive of how careful she was with money,' her brother Christopher Waugh told the court.

The millionairess was born in Haswell
in County Durham on 20 June, 1962 and was brought up by her mother 
after her father Stephen died when she was young.

She
joined the civil service after leaving Shotton Hall comprehensive 
school but at 22 decided to leave the area and seek her fortune in 
London.

'She was 
determined to make her own way in the City of London,' said Mr Waugh, 
who revealed that Carole had carefully erased any trace of her northeast
accent by the time of her death.

Miss Waugh, who always wore a wedding
ring and went jogging every night, told her family in around 2011 she 
had a wealthy fiance called 'Earl' who had connections to Brentford 
football club and lived in south London.

She later explained that the wedding had been called off after his mother died.

Other
boyfriends included a deep sea diver called Peter and a mystery man who
drove an Audi TT and was known only as 'The Boy Wonder'.

Bhayani was a professional conman who was always pretending to be someone else in a life-long career as a 'grifter.'

His own QC described him as 'a huge show off.'

He has made 14 court appearances for 95 separate offences and has tried so many scams in betting shops he was once banned from every Ladbrokes in the country.

He was released from this sentence just six weeks before Carole Waugh died.

Bhayani has a daughter and had desperately tried to keep his marriage together by pretending to his wife he was seeking help for his gambling addiction.

He would get Kutner to pose as his case worker who would collect him from his home for 'treatment' and phone up his wife to give her regular progress reports. 

Kutner specialises in buying jewellery through fraud and selling it on. He has made 13 court appearances for 97 offences, beginning in 1986.

He was posed as a wine merchant to fraudulently buy fine vintages which were quickly converted into cash.

Kutner was not averse to preying on family and friends - in July 2007 he was asked to house sit for a former girlfriend and ransacked her home.

He was involved with another woman and stole her cashpoint card to remove £400.

She finished with him but began seeing him again and he bought her a diamond engagement ring and pendant.

He told her the ring's clasp was loose and pawned it for gambling money.

Miss Waugh had set up a monthly direct debit of around £20 with the National Lottery in the hope of hitting the jackpot but in July a letter arrived to say that it had not been paid.

Brother Christopher, a branch manager at Barclays, asked permission to check the state of her accounts but was refused by his bosses on the grounds that it would breach the Data Protection Act.

Her family have always insisted that Miss Waugh would never have agreed to hand over they keys to her assets to a fraudster without a fight.

Mother Margaret Waugh told the court: 'If she bought something she would always say how much it was. Carole has always been obsessed about money and possessive over her own items.'

Mr Justice Wilkie deferred sentencing until tomorrow for Bhayani and Kutner to allow for Ms Waugh's family to attend.

'I am particularly aware that the family of Carole Waugh are not in attendance today and that it should be desirable that they should be present,' he told the court.

'I have in mind that I should proceed to sentence tomorrow when they will be here and therefore able to hear what is said. I know that they are coming from a long way distant.'
