A photographer has used his seven-year-old daughter's Lego to recreate the works of street artist Banksy.

Jeff Friesen has recreated many of the mysterious street artist's iconic works from the plastic bricks.

The 42-year-old from Halifax, Canada, used his daughter June's Lego to complete the project he calls Bricksy.

Friesen has recreated many of the street artist's iconic works like Peel Ficton which Friesen calls Banana Pulp

Banksy's 2007 Peel Fiction piece, which was an adaptation of a scene from Quentin Tarantino's 1994-cult-classic, Pulp Fiction, showed Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta pointing bananas instead of guns

Highlights include tongue-in-cheek versions of Balloon Girl, Banana Pulp and Bouquet Thrower - all with Jeff's own funny captions and embellishments.

He said: 'The work makes an unexpected connection between Banksy's street art and Lego bricks. 'There is something compelling about gritty street scenes rendered in clean, modernist Lego bricks.

'For many Bricksy scenes I hope to give viewers an extended story for Banksy's work, often infused with sideways humour. 

'The iconic bouquet thrower, for example, is revealed to be throwing flowers to his girlfriend in a tale of forbidden love - she happens to be a police officer.'

Banksy's Girl With Balloon was one his most talked about pieces of his career - here is Jeff Friesen's adaptation

The original work by Banksy depicts a young girl losing a heart-shaped balloon to the wind

Sweep It Under The Carpet by Banksy first appeared in Chalk Farm, London. Many were quick to claim that this piece was a statement against the government's reluctance to tackle issues

Kissing Coppers: The police are enthusiastic supporters of stop-and-frisk policies

Banksy's Kissing Coppers piece dates back to 2004 when it appeared on the Prince Albert Pub in Brighton, England. The piece depicts two male policemen engaging in a passionate kiss

Each scene takes Jeff about a day including Lego building and photography. He says he typically takes five or six versions of each scene.

He said: 'A lot of time is spent looking for Lego parts, as my daughter has access to the same brick collection, which are technically hers.

'It is challenging to make gritty street scenes in clean, modernist Lego bricks, though there is a fun irony to it. I also wanted to do more than a straightforward recreation of Banksy's work, not always successfully. 

'For example, in The Mother of Anarchy the scene is zoomed out from Banksy's original and includes the surrounding trashed buildings and riot police.'

'I think of Banksy as a culture-shifting phenomenon...not just for his artwork but for his wit and his toying with the art world. Even his critics cannot deny a before-Banksy and after-Banksy moment.'

The Mother of Anarchy: Raising a well-presented anarchist has never been easier in these tumultuous times

Bouquet Thrower: Friesen's take on Flower Thrower shows a strong-arm flower deliverer specialising in tragically forbidden love

Flower Thrower: The subject, who appears to be involved in a riot, wears a handkerchief and backwards cap and is depicted armed with a bouquet of flowers instead of a Molotov cocktail

Unique: Jeff Friesen's Like a Rat on a Wire is his version of Banksy's Tightrope Rat

Paleo Diet: Follow your instincts - devour sugar, carbs, and mystery meat whenever you come across them

Painted House is a take on Banksy's Crayola House which appeared in LA in 2011

Jeff Friesen's version of Choose Your Weapon. The title suggests that the subject's weapon of choice is man's best friend

The piece, often mislabeled, was not a Banksy/Keith Haring collaboration as the latter passed away in 1990

Force 5 Fridge: Friesen's version suggests their is a surreal storm approaching

Deep Sea Diners: Friesen said he wanted to do more than just simply recreate Banksy's original and some include buildings and other characters in the background

Urban Cowboy: Breaking in a spirited stack of bricks can be backbreaking

Skeleton Keys: Fuchsia transportation provides an extra bit of shock value for the discriminating undead

Eye-catching: The Skeleton Car is in Brick Lane, East London and appeared in 2007

Photo Opportunity: There's got to be an angle of Big Ben the world hasn't seen, though it's not for lack of trying

Keep It Real: Say yes to your inner monkey Jeff Friesen says with this adaptation

Old Skool: You never really know who your future self is going to be. It's probably better that way

Thug for Life: This piece of art shows a group of pensioners with baseball caps and a ghetto blaster

Monkey Business: Laugh now, but you're paying thousands of pounds a year for burnt coffee
