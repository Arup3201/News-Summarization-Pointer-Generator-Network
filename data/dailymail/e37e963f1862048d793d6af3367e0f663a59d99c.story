Police are hunting thieves who stole one of Britain's rarest and most valuable puppies worth a whopping £16,000 - because it's purple.

The cute eight-week old British bulldog puppy called Lila is so valuable because of her lilac colouring.

Officers say it was snatched from his breeder by a man who was pretending to buy the puppy.

The black man with short afro hair grabbed the pup when the specialist breeder's back was turned and ran out of the home - knocking a female relative to the ground.

He then jumped in a waiting car and his white male accomplice drove off at speed, almost hitting another member of the family outside the home in Tadworth, Surrey.

The incident happened at around 8pm on Saturday and now Surrey Police are asking anybody with any information to come forward.

The man who took the dog is described as around 5ft 10ins, of medium build, and had one of his top teeth missing.

Investigating officer Detective Constable Eloise Lock said: 'This was a nasty incident which has left the dog breeder and her family distressed.

'The puppy is extremely distinguishable and rare because of its colour. We are hoping because of that the public can help us reunite it with the owner.

'Anyone who may have been offered the puppy or knows anything about where it might have been sold is urged to get in touch with us.'

Lilac-coloured British bulldogs are so valuable because of their rarity, but they are not recognised by the Kennel Club as an official colour, so are not often used for dog shows.

A spokesperson for the British Bulldog Club said: 'Everything has a worth to someone, and if the breeder thinks their lilac puppy is worth £16,000 then that's what it's worth.

'Lilac-coloured bulldogs are more suitable to be pets rather than show dogs, because the Kennel Club do not recognise their colour as standard.'

Pedigree British bulldog pups usually sell for around £2,000, but the 'lilac' ones are much more expensive as they are seen as more desirable.

Lila, who has been microchipped, is believed to be one of the only lilac pedigree bulldogs in Britain - leading to her huge price tag.

Other rare breeds of puppy at the dog breeder's home are up for sale from £600 to over £2,000

The breeder, who asked not to be named, said: 'She is worth from around £10,000 to £16,000. I don't sell my puppies to other breeders, only as pets.

'The ironic thing is that I hadn't even discussed money with the man, who said his name was James. The second I turned my back, he just grabbed her and ran off, barging past my daughter and niece.'

Lila is one of a litter of four, specially bred from selected stock to produce gorgeous, lilac-coloured puppies.

Her owner also breeds French bulldogs and Shar Pei pups, as well as British bulldogs like Lila.

To secure other litters, she has now installed CCTV cameras outside her home, and is launching an online campaign to try to find her stolen pup.
