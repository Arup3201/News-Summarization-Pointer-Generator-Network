'Staggering hypocrisy': Unite general secretary Len McCluskey, pictured, has condemned zero-hour contracts

Labour's union paymasters faced accusations of hypocrisy last night after it was revealed that they use tutors employed on controversial ‘zero-hours’ contracts.

Unite, Britain’s biggest trade union, has led a campaign against bosses who take on staff without guaranteeing how many hours they will work, or how much they will be paid.

General secretary ‘Red’ Len McCluskey has claimed the ‘pernicious practice’ is blighting Britain and ‘the Government’s refusal to address the growing scandal is creating a growing sub-class of insecure and low-paid employment’.

Labour leader Ed Miliband, whose party has received £12 million in donations from the Left-wing organisation since the Election, has also claimed that workers on zero-hours contracts are being exploited.

But today it can be revealed that Unite’s own union reps are being taught by academics employed by further education colleges on zero-hours contracts.

A leaked report presented to bosses admits the practice is going on, and could be ‘problematic’ given the union’s opposition to deals that are said to leave staff with little job security, no pension or holiday pay.

Last night Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps criticised the  union over its ‘staggering  hypocrisy’. He said: ‘Len McCluskey spent the summer shamelessly grandstanding about zero-hours contracts, yet Unite reps are being trained in colleges using these contracts.

‘Rank-and-file union members will be appalled to discover their union not only teaches lessons in intimidation, but that Unite’s leadership preaches against the use of zero-hour contracts while using them.’

The unpublished report, Education Inquiry For Unite, presented to its executive council earlier this year, describes how the union has tried to cut costs on courses and states: ‘There were savings to be made when tutors who were only irregularly required were now on zero-hours contracts.

‘It was recognised that such changes had been challenging though, given trade union perspectives on zero-hours contracts more generally.’

Unite insisted it did not directly employ the tutors, who work for colleges and who give short courses to union reps in how to campaign more effectively. A spokesman said: ‘Unite is not a zero-hours employer.

‘That view will have been made clear to the colleges, but we cannot be answerable for their employment practices.’
