With its round bed draped with gauze curtains, pink decor and dim lighting, this room resembles a hotel hideaway frequented by amorous couples.

In fact the suite is located inside a hospital in China, which has opened a dedicated 'sex room' in a bid to help would-be parents who are struggling to conceive.

The Wuhan Songziniao Hospital even has porn and saucy outfits available on request for patients making use of the facility, which is decorated with erotic art and equipped with an array of sex toys.

Setting the mood: The dimly-lit room in the hospital in Hubei province is designed to encourage pregnancy by 'inspiring sexual passion' in fertility patients

Love nest: Fertility-challenged couples hoping to make use of the new facility inside the hospital must pay 880 Yuan per night for the privilege

The hospital in China's Hubei province said the room has been designed to 'encourage pregnancy by inspiring sexual passion in the patients'.

The ward is also furnished with a plush sofa and flat-screen TV should couples wish to take advantage of a DVD offering advice and tips, or to watch a selection from the library of porn films on offer at the facility.

For patients still struggling to get in the mood, nurse and air hostess outfits are available on request.

Experts are also on hand to provide tips on boosting the chances of conceiving, the hospital said.

But all this encouragement comes at a price - couples wishing to make use of the facility must pay 880 yuan - or Â£88 - per night for the privilege.
