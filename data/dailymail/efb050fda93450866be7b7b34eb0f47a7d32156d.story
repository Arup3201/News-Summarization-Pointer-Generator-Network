The Irish challenge for next week’s £1million Crabbie’s Grand National looks like being eight strong after trainer Robbie Hennessy confirmed Rubi Light a definite runner.

The grade one winner over two and a half miles schooled over Aintree-style fences on Saturday under big race jockey Andrew Lynch.

Rubi Light had the option of running Friday’s shorter Topham Chase but Hennessy said: ‘He is going to run. There is only one National. One of his runs over three miles was when he was second in the Lexus Chase to Synchronised and he went on to win the Gold Cup that season.

‘Rubi Light is not as fast as he used to be but his jumping has been fantastic this year and he is in great form.’

The Irish challenge also includes Jim Culloty’s Lord Windermere (Robbie McNamara) and Spring Heeled (Nick Scholfield), Willie Mullins-trained Ballycasey (Ruby Walsh), Mouse Morris’s First Lieutenant (Nina Carberry) and Gordon Elliott’s Cause Of Causes (Paul Carberry).

On Saturday Maurice Phelan confirmed Portrait King (Davy Condon) an intended starter while Peter Fahey said Owega Star (Robert Power) also runs.

Meanwhile, Richie McLernon has been confirmed for the mount on Emma Lavelle’s Court By Surprise while condition jockey Sean Bowen has a chance to pick up the one steeplechase win he still requires to be qualified to partner Paul Nicholls-trained Mon Parrain at Aintree when he rides Virak in the 888sport.com Handicap Chase at Haydock on Sunday afternoon.

But Nicholls denied he had deliberately identified the opportunity to put Bowen up.

The trainer said: ‘I am not thinking about the Grand National, just that Virak has top weight and I am taking five pounds off.

The Irish challenge also includes Jim Culloty’s Spring Heeled who will be ridden by Nick Scholfield

‘He is not over big and we thought it was ideal to claim off him.

‘I also have something that Sean could ride on Monday and we will try to get him the winner he needs but if it doesn’t happen, it doesn’t happen.’

Joseph O’Brien, who is battling to reduce his weight so he can continue to ride regularly on the Flat, has his first rides on the level at Cork on Sunday afternoon.

He rides East India (9st 6lb) and Hans Holbein (9st 5lb) for his father Aidan.
