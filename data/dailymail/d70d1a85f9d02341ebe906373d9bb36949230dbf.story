Rail passengers have been warned to expect major disruption to train services around the country over the Easter holidays as the getaway begins.

Some main London stations will even be closed due to a huge programme of planned engineering work leading to delays, cancellations and replacement buses.

Rail bosses insist that Bank Holidays are the best time to carry out engineering work as fewer people travel than at peak commuter times. But critics say it wrecks holiday plans and drives people into their  cars.

The bad news comes as Easter holidays have begun for millions of schoolchildren.

Mark Tanzer, chief executive of travel organisation Abta, said: ‘It is start of the Easter spring school holidays and we estimate that more than a million British holidaymakers are set to head overseas over this weekend.

‘Spain is the UK’s favourite foreign holiday destination over the weekend, with the Canary and Balearic islands (including Majorca and Ibiza) the most popular areas. Turkey and Tunisia have also sold well.’

He said Florida was the most popular long-haul destination, with the top five city destinations being Paris, Dublin, Amsterdam, Rome and New York.

Mr Tanzer said: 'Bookings for UK breaks are healthy, with many customers travelling to traditional seaside resorts, national parks and holiday camps.’
