The elevator which crushed a woman to death had maintenance work shortly before she was killed, authorities said today.

Suzanne Hart, 41, of Brooklyn, New York, 
was killed on Wednesday in a freak accident when the elevator 
malfunctioned at the Manhattan offices of ad agency Y&R.

Ms Hart was caught as the doors were closing and got dragged as it shot up, crushing her to death between floors of the Madison Avenue building.

Tony Sclafani, a spokesman for the city Department of Buildings, told the New York Post: 'This work has now become the focus of our investigation.'

Investigators said they would look closely at work done by the contracting company, Transel, who has worked on elevators at dozens of buildings in New York including the Plaza Hotel and Intrepid-Sea Air Space Museum at Pier 86.

The Madison Avenue building where Ms Hart was killed remained closed today.

Her boyfriend Chris Dickson told the New York Times: ‘She’s a beautiful person, and I don’t have words for this. I loved her.’

He also told the New York Daily News that they were together for more than five years, adding: 'She was the bright spot in my life'.

‘No father could have ever been more 
proud of her,’ her father Alex Hart, who has flown north from his home 
in Florida to New York, told the New York Times.

‘She was a fantastic young woman,’ he 
told the New York Post. ‘I’m grateful for every day I had with her. I’m 
just sorry it happened so soon - I miss her.’

Two other people who got on just 
before looked on in horror as Ms Hart was killed – and they were rescued
and taken to hospital for trauma.

The lift jammed between the first and 
second floors but nobody was physically injured apart from Ms Hart, a 
director of business development.

Ms Hart was stepping onto the elevator when her foot became caught in the gap between the elevator car and the lobby floor.

Safety officials say the car then rose
abruptly with its doors still open, pulling her along, inside the 
26-storey office near Grand Central Terminal.

The building has been the long-time 
home of Ms Hart's company, the advertising agency Y&R, formerly 
known as Young & Rubicam.

Investigators are trying to determine 
what went wrong. Safety mechanisms should prevent elevators from moving 
while their doors are open.

A buildings department spokesman said the elevator was inspected in June and no safety issues were found then.

The last time the elevator received a violation for a safety hazard was in 2003, and the condition was corrected, he said.

The elevator is one of 13 in the tower
and was taken out of use. Y&R announced days ago that it plans to 
vacate the building for a new base.

Ms Hart, originally from California, 
had worked at the agency - which represents Campbell Soup, Land Rover 
and Xerox - since June 2007.

She was in charge of helping to drum 
up new business and prepare pitches for new clients and was described as
a 'crazy hard worker' by colleagues.

'I was going up in the elevator. I heard a loud crash, then I heard the alarm. I didn’t know what the hell was going on'

'Most people who worked with her would
tell you that she was one of the nicest people around,’ one colleague 
told the New York Daily News.

Art director Lee Tripe told the New York Daily News he was riding in another elevator when the accident occurred.

The building's elevators have received
many safety violation citations over the years. The complaints were all
dismissed by the city buildings department.

Chris Dickson

There are around 60,000 elevators in 
the city, which caused 53 accidents last year - three of which were 
fatal, reported the New York Times.

Former Y&R director of client 
services Chad Kawalec told the New York Times that the elevators at the 
building were old and creaky.

‘They weren’t the kind of elevators that you stuck your hand in to catch the doors because they wouldn’t stop,’ he said.
