Her mysterious disappearance has gripped the nation for the last 12 days.

Since 10 month old Lisa Irwin vanished from her crib at her parents' Kansas City home October 4 the family have been growing increasingly desperate for new leads.

Now the cousin of the missing baby has made a heart-felt plea for her return, saying he would gladly give his own life in exchange.

'I'd gladly give my life to bring Lisa home safely,' Mike Lerette told Good Morning America. 'We're hanging in there. Please, please, please keep praying.'

Yesterday the family decided to reveal home videos of the baby aged only three months to spread her image in a fresh attempt to help find her.

At the same time a mystery donor offered a $100,000 reward was put up for her return or the conviction of anyone involved in her going missing.

Missing: Her parents say she disappeared from her crib overnight as her mother and two brothers slept

Deborah Bradley and Jeremy Irwin say their daughter went missing early on October 4, when she was 10 months old. Authorities have searched for her but still have no suspects or major leads.

Her parents say she disappeared from her crib overnight as her mother and two brothers slept.

In the latest videos released Friday, the baby is shown making happy sounds, eating and playing in a walker while her mother coos to her, calling her ‘Pumpkin Pie’.

Police have been sweeping woodland in a desperate attempt to find any clues relating to her disappearance.

A mystery man recorded shopping for alcohol 
and baby wipes with her mother hours just five hours before her daughter
was last seen was revealed this week to be her uncle.

Baby Lisa: Deborah Bradley said that she put her daughter in her crib October 4

Ms Bradley claims she put Lisa to bed at 10:30pm October 4.

When Mr Irwin checked on the child 
when he got home from work, however, the baby was gone, and she was 
reported missing by her parents early on Tuesday.

Her parents claimed someone must have 
crept into their home while the child's mother and brothers slept and 
snatched the baby girl, saying that the front window had been tampered 
with.

Hunt: Lisa Irwin's parents Jeremy Irwin and Deborah Bradley are now working with a private investigator

Bill Stanton, a New York-based security 
consultant for television networks, said that the reward to help find 
her was coming from anonymous sources.

Mr Stanton who is known in New York as 'Wild Bill' has said he would be working on the 
case for an undetermined amount of time and that he was 'hopeful this 
child is safe and alive’.

It is thought his services have been 
paid for by a wealthy family. Police said he has no access to 
investigative files and will only be able to look at ‘anything the 
general public has access to’.

Search: Private investigator Bill Stanton has been hired to work with Baby Lisa's family
