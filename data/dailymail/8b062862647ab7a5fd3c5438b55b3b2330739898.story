Christmas came early for the chimpanzees at Taronga Zoo as they were treated to some gift-wrapped presents in their exhibit.

The chimps were quick to pounce on the festive-themed enrichment items prepared by the zoo keepers, showing off their natural foraging skills to unwrap their delicious goodies inside.

Like many youngsters at Christmas time who love to play with bubble wrap, a 15-month-old chimpanzee named 'Fumo' seemed just as happy playing with the cardboard box packaging.

'Christmas is always an exciting time for us, so we like to share that joy with the animals,' senior primate keeper, Lou Grossfeldt said.

'The Chimpanzees received some extra treats today, with some brightly-coloured boxes full of special treats and shredded paper to encourage them to have a bit of a forage.

'These enrichment activities provide important mental and physical stimulation for our animals, providing them with opportunities to show off the skills they have developed to be successful survivors in the wild.'

Taronga’s Goodfellow’s Tree Kangaroos also received a surprised gift from a Secret Conservation Santa in the form of a Christmas wreath decorated with their favourite fruits and flowers.

‘Kwikila’ and her young joey ‘Nupela’ demonstrated their amazing climbing skills to retrieve the tasty treats from the tree top.

Zoo keepers also spread some Christmas cheer at Taronga’s Cotton-top Tamarin exhibit.

And some Christmas bon bons caused a stir among the tiny primates, who were quick to tear their presents open and grab the mealworms and maggots concealed within.
