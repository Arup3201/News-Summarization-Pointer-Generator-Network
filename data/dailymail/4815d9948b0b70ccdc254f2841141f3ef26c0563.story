Daniel Ricciardo is smiling. He’s always smiling, but today he has a greater reason than already emerging as the virtuoso performer from this Formula One season, to be happy. It was his birthday.

Ricciardo, the only driver outside of Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, to win a grand prix this season, has reached the grand old age of 25.

So, does he have anything planned to celebrate hitting a quarter of a century? ‘No. Not really,’ the Australian says. ‘Perhaps, I’ll get a haircut.’

It’s an answer which may have James Hunt, the 1976 World Champion, whose notoriety for his frivolous conduct away from the track was arguably greater than his displays in a race car, turning in his grave.

But Ricciardo, who moved to England to pursue his motor racing career six years ago, insists his partying days are all but a distant memory.

‘I guess when I first came here I was probably 19-years-old, and there was a pretty big group of young kids here who we used to boogie with,’ he says. ‘But my boogie days are over.’

On track, and Ricciardo has played the role of party-pooper at Red Bull this season; expected to be second fiddle to four-times World Champion Sebastian Vettel, following his promotion from the team’s junior outfit Toro Rosso, the Australian has upset the odds.

Not only is he ahead of his more established team-mate in the drivers’ championship by 23 points, he has also qualified in front of the German six times from the opening eight races.

Indeed, of the four grands prix they have both finished in China, Bahrain, Spain, and Canada - where Ricciardo claimed his maiden grand prix win after passing Rosberg in the most dramatic of finales - he has finished ahead of Vettel on each occasion.

‘Coming into a World Championship-winning team you try not to be like that kid on the first day at school, you ease into it,’ Ricciardo explains. ‘But now I feel like I can be who I am and I don’t have to be someone different.

‘Obviously you want to win as soon as you can and to have already done it in the first part of the year was good. I’ve had a lot of great results already this year which has done a lot for me confidence wise, and that just topped it off.’

Unlike his predecessor Mark Webber, who endured a tulmutuous four-year partnership alongside Vettel at Red Bull, Ricciardo enjoys a healthy relationship with the reigning World Champion.‘We do get along outside the car and I think we’ve really handled the year well,’ Ricciardo said.

‘Although in the car it is different. No-one is even close to being a friend when they get in the car.’

Upon his switch to Red Bull, Ricciardo made a deliberate attempt to raise his professionalism, admitting he couldn’t have joined the team and acted ‘like a clown’.

But the Australian, eight races into his Red Bull career, admits he still enjoys playing practical jokes away from the cockpit, despite the last laugh usually falling on him.

‘They play jokes on me,’ he says, referring to his team of mechanics. ‘On Sunday mornings, I get in the car and I do a few things in the cockpit. I have to take my shoes off to get in the car. But they glued my shoes together on the floor. I put my feet in the shoes, went to walk off, and nearly face planted. But I’ll get them back, I’m just being patient.’

Ahead of this weekend’s British Grand Prix, Ricciardo is a whopping 83 points adrift of championship leader Rosberg. But does he expect the German, who holds the equivalent of a race victory over Hamilton to win the title?

‘It will all come down to who has got the clearest mind, and who is thinking the straightest on a Sunday,’ he says.

‘Both Nico and Lewis are very evenly paced. Nico has had more luck in terms of reliability, but I think that will all even itself out over the course of the year and if it does it will be the smartest driver who wins. Who that is I don’t know. Nico is a bit more stable and consistent but Lewis, on his day, can be very strong, and if he has more of those days than Nico, then I think that might be enough.’
