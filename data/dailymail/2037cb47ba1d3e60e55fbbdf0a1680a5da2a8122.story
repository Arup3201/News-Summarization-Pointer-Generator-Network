A former Tory foreign minister was rebuked by her party chairman after comparing the deaths of four people in a synagogue in Israel to protests at the Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem.

Baroness Warsi, who resigned in August over the government’s policy on Gaza, tweeted: ‘Israeli extremists storm Al Aqsa & intimidate worshippers – Palestinian extremists storm synagogue & kill 4 worshippers.’

Her comments sparked claims that she was comparing protests at a mosque to the murderous attack by two Palestinians armed with a gun and axe.

A British-born father and three American citizens were killed in the attack by Palestinian terrorists.

They were slaughtered in a dawn attack by two cousins who screamed 'god is great' as they attacked at random.

Victim Rabbi Avraham Shmuel Goldberg, described as a 'pillar of the community', was born in Liverpool and held a dual British-Israeli passport.

Mr Goldberg, 68, is a grandfather who lived in Golders Green in London before moving to Israel and was a regular visitor to the synagogue. 

The others killed in the attack have been named as Rabbi Moshe Twersky, Rabbi Arieh Kopinsky, 43, and Rabbi Calman Levine, who were all dual US-Israeli nationals. The two terrorists were shot dead after the attack by police.

Thousands of people attended a funeral for Twersky at the Torat Moshe yeshiva in Sanhedria early this afternoon, which was closely followed by a joint funeral for Kupinsky, Levine and Goldberg before sundown - the latter held outside the synagogue where the attack occurred.

Baroness Warsi posted the comments on Twitter at 10.16am. SHe asked another user: 'r u suggesting there is NO link (nt justification) between murders in the synagogue & the weeks of intimidation & attacks.' 

Grant Shapps responded on Twitter ‘to be clear’ that the Conservative peer ‘speaks for herself, not the party’. He said: ‘Our prayers are with families of those murdered. No justification for terrorism’.

Baroness Warsi replied to insist she was calling for ‘justice for all’ rather than ‘hypocrisy’.

‘Both Palestinian & Israeli lives have been lost in recent weeks at the hands of extremists,’ she wrote. 

‘Both David_Cameron & Ed_Miliband say a Palestinian life is equal to an Israeli life so let's ALL condemn the killing on BOTH sides.’

She also asked one commenter whether they believed there was no link between the murders at the synagogue and weeks of protest at the Al Aqsa mosque.

The Al Aqsa mosque, on Temple Mount in the heart of the Old City of Jerusalem, is one of the holiest sites for Muslims. Temple Mount is also considered by many to be the holiest place in Judaism, although traditionally the Jews worshipped outside the walled area itself – at the Western Wall.

In recent months, some Jews have visited Temple Mount itself, which has beentem fiercely resisted by Muslims worshipping at the site.

Jews have had to be protected by armed guards as they tour the site, with some people believing the visits are deliberately aggravating the situation.

Later, Baroness Warsi wrote on the Huffington Post UK website: ‘These murders must be condemned. I condemn them, as I have loudly condemned previous instances of Palestinian violence against civilians.’

But she said: ‘My successor as Conservative Party chairman, Grant Shapps, is only too willing to criticise Palestinian terror while refusing to vote in favour of a Palestinian state in parliament, and give young Palestinians hope and dignity.

‘Remember: the indisputable lesson of modern Middle East history is that violence breeds violence.’

 An earlier version of this article referred to the Temple Mount as 'a holy site for Jews.' We amended this to state that it is considered by many to be the holiest place in Judaism.
