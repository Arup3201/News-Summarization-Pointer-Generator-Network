A killer prisoner has posted selfies from behind bars boasting of his easy life drinking, taking drugs and playing computer games in prison onto Facebook.

Dale Done posted the half naked pictures onto the social networking site from a smuggled phone, which he used to brag about his life playing the Playstation.

He was jailed for eight years in 2009 after he admitted causing the death of his best friend Daniel Harding, 17, after he crashed a stolen car in Liverpool.

After three years he was released on parole, but breached his licence conditions and was jailed again.

His victim's family told the Sun that they were devastated to see him on Facebook.

Daniel's mother Julie, 47, said that her son's killer even popped up in the 'people you may know' section of her own profile.

She said: 'I felt sick. He's supposed to be being punished, and that involves zero contact with the outside world.'

In one post Done said: 'Goin to get rotton agen today haha.' 'Rotton', or rotten, is slang for getting drunk.

The account has since been shut down and the phone has now been confiscated.

Prisoners are banned from updating their Facebook accounts while serving their sentence or asking others to do so from outside prison.

The Ministry of Justice has warned any inmates who are caught breaking the rules will be 'stripped of privileges' and the matter 'referred to the police'.

Figures released following a Freedom of Information request last year revealed the number of detected active accounts which had been deleted had jumped from 49 in 2012 to 93 up to by the end of November.

While numbers had risen over 2013, the figure has in fact dropped dramatically from 2010 and 2011, when 203 and 204 active accounts were deleted.

It means a total of 549 prisoners' Facebook accounts have been detected as being active and deleted since 2010 in the latest full figures.
