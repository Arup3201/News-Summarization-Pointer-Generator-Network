A majority of Germans do not trust European Union institutions according to a poll showing a shift to greater Euroscepticism in Europe’s largest economy.

The YouGov Deutschland survey also showed a majority of Germans believe a British exit from the EU would be bad for both Germany and the EU.

Nearly two in three Germans polled said Germany and Britain could be strong allies in reforming the EU, though France is still viewed as Germany’s most important ally.

David Cameron, who has pledged to hold a referendum on Britain’s continued EU membership by 2017, is the most trusted foreign EU leader among Germans, four points ahead of French President Francois Hollande.

Fewer than one in three Germans trust the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, and the European Parliament fared only slightly better, said the poll, which interviewed 1,010 adults last month.

Half of those surveyed said they backed efforts by some EU politicians, who include Cameron, to repatriate powers from the European level, while 26 percent were opposed.

A majority of Germans wanted to cut Berlin’s contribution to the EU budget and thought farm and regional aid subsidies - the two largest budget items - should be dealt with at the national level.

'Though Germany will remain wedded to 
Europe, once the question of EU powers is boiled down to specific 
policies, there is widespread support among German public opinion for 
the return of powers from Brussels to member states,' said Nina Schick, 
an analyst at the Open Europe think-tank which published the poll.

The findings chime with a previous 
YouGov poll published on September 3 that underlined German weariness 
with bailing out ailing euro zone members after three years of debt 
crisis, and confirmed a loss of appetite for 'more Europe' in Germany, 
which has traditionally backed closer EU integration.

Reform: After three years of bailing out broken economies, the Germans are increasingly tired of the EU

A new anti-euro party, the Alternative fuer Deutschland (AfD), could break the five per cent barrier to enter parliament after the election on Sunday, though opinion polls show a strong majority of Germans continue to back the common currency.

Chancellor Angela Merkel is tipped to win Germany’s election on Sunday, though it is unclear who will join her conservatives in the next coalition government.

Merkel, who has backed off from her earlier calls for 'more Europe', has forged a good working relationship with Cameron and has refrained from criticising his push for looser British ties to the EU.
