The debt-ridden Greek government is hoping to raise desperately needed funds by selling the former London home of the country's consul general.

Boasting one of London's most exclusive addresses it hoped the sprawling double-fronted property in Holland Park, Notting Hill, could generate up to £26million if it is sold.

Local estate agent Marsh and Partons said similar properties fetched rents of £25,000 a week, while Richard Branson's neighbouring property went on the market for £17million last year.

The sprawling 115-year-old stucco-fronted building is one of a number of government-owned assets to have been earmarked for sale in coming weeks as the state attempts to reduce its huge national debt.

Upmarket estate agents are currently being considered to sell the 10,000sq ft property which is located in the second most expensive part of the UK.

Other properties going on the market include the former royal estate in Tatoi, situated on the outskirts of Athens which comes with 40 outbuildings, stables, a swimming pool and several royal graves.

A selection of Rolls Royces and other 
items which formerly belonged to exiled king Constantine still sit on 
the driveway of Tatoi Palace.

For the right price the Acropolis, the ancient citadel located on a high rocky outcrop above Athens, will be made available for the first time to film and camera crews.

Offices in Belgrade and Brussels have also been highlighted as potential money spinners as have smaller property in Llubljana and land in Cyprus.

Large parts of Greek Islands such as Corfu, Rhodes and Mykonos are also set to be sold to the highest bidder as are marinas, airports and roads.

The state-owned gas company, post office and lottery were also pinpointed for sale yesterday.

Foreign ministry spokesman Gregory Dalevekouras, said: 'There is a decision to lease and sell properties that for various reasons are not being used,' It was reported in the Guardian.

The news came the day after Athens' finance minister delivered more bad news to the long-suffering population when he announced that national income was expected to fall by 25 per cent by 2014.

On the island of Corfu Government officials have revealed in March that a tender has been launched for the exploitation of a large seaside plot

Earlier this month the government said it had identified 40 uninhabited islands which it hoped to lease out for the development of 'tourism ventures'

The 
Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund said it was seeking to sell the 
'right of surface' for the 120-acre, forested property at Kassiopi for 
up to 100 years.

Greece has committed to raise £15billion of by 2015 but with the debt still at 166 per cent of GDP such a target is a tall order.

For many Greeks yesterday's announcement is the latest blow in a humiliating process that has seen poverty and unemployment hit record levels.

However, minister of development Kostis Hadzidakis said: 'desperate times call for desperate measures. We are in a war situation and we are all in civilian clothes.'
