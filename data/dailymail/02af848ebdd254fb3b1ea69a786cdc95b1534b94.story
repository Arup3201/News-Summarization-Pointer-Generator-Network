If only all math classes were like this.

A teacher at an evangelical Christian university in California has played an impressive prank on his students that left them gasping with amazement.

With help from a media undergraduate, mathematics lecturer Matthew Weathers, of Biola University in La Mirada, Los Angeles, put on a 'live' show on complex numbers using a projector.

It showed him and another teacher interacting in a hilarious - but educational - routine for April Fool's Day 2011.

After posting the video on YouTube, he said: 'Yesterday afternoon I did another video trick for my Nature of Math class at Biola University.

'What's the difference between the real and the imaginary? Can an imaginary person (like a person in a YouTube video) do something outside the confines of a video box?

'Thanks again to Andrew Staver who did most of the work on this video. He's graduating this semester with a degree in Film Production from the Cinema and Media Arts department.'

And he's gone: The 'imaginary' teacher reaches out of the internet browser during his presentation
