A man who drunkenly smashed car wing mirrors was murdered by a passer-by because he refused to apologise, a jury heard.

Robert Alderman has been accused of battering petty vandal Paul Scott to the ground and then dancing around him ‘like Muhammad Ali’.

A court heard that Mr Scott, 43, was walking home from a night out in February with his family when he started damaging the cars.

Tragedy: Paul Scott, 43, was allegedly murdered after he drunkenly smashed car wing mirrors

Alderman, 22, had been to a nightclub nearby in Gillingham, Kent, when he saw what Mr Scott had done and approached him.

Accused: Robert Alderman, 22, is alleged to have murdered petty vandal Mr Scott in Gillingham, Kent

It is alleged that he repeatedly punched, kicked and stamped on his victim before demanding: 'Say sorry and I will stop hitting you.'

The court heard that 20-stone Mr Scott was left covered in blood after the attack and barely able to walk but was sent home after being treated by medics.

But his right leg had been broken and he died four days later from a pulmonary embolism - a blood clot in a main artery in the lung.

His brother, Gary Chaplin, told Maidstone Crown Court that at one point his brother was on his knees ‘being used as a punch bag’.

He said: ‘He was so fast it was impossible to known how many punches.

‘It was like something out of a horror film, to be honest.’

Alderman, of Gillingham, denies murder and an alternative charge of manslaughter.

He admits affray and assaulting Mr Chaplin.

The trial continues.
