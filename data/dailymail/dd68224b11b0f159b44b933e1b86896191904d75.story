Monaco have admitted that they wanted to keep James Rodriguez, in the wake of his £60m move to Real Madrid.

The World Cup Golden Boot winner has signed a six-year deal with the Spanish giants, but Monaco CEO Vadim Vasilyev has admitted that the club were reluctant to sell the 23-year-old.

'Monaco
 are proud to have helped James Rodriguez reveal his talent to the world
 as he notably made his mark on the 2014 World Cup in Brazil winning the
 Golden Boot,' he told the official club website.VIDEO Scroll down to see James Rodriguez arrive at Real Madrid for a medical

Rodriguez only joined the club from Porto last summer, and went on to score nine goals in 34 games as Monaco finished second in Ligue 1.

Vasilyev added: 'James is a fantastic player who achieved great things with Monaco and the club had no intention to sell the player.

'However the time came when the solution of a transfer was considered to be the most beneficial solution for all parties.'
