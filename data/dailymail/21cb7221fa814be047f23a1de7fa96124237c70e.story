If you're still reeling from the sight of Cheryl Cole's 'cheek art', look away now.

The star, who recently had both buttocks and her back tattooed with flowers, was nothing on these inked-up specimens, who have chosen to decorate their heads with an array of bizarre designs.

From a topless angel emerging from between pigtails to a full English breakfast slathered all over one chap's bald bonce, it seems nothing is too weird - or too painful-looking - for true body art aficionados.

And while a study by the University of St
Andrews reveals today that managers are less likely to employ someone 
if they have a tattoo, there are clearly some who want to have 
their tatts as in-your-face as possible.

The Metropolitan Police has recently banned its officers from getting visible tattoos, according to the BBC, with Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe saying they 'damage the professional image of the police'.

Even so, one in five people in Britain has a tattoo of some kind - although most of them are a little less noticeable than this hair-splitting selection.

And among 19- to 44-year-olds, that figure rises to 29 per cent - for both men and women.

The number of celebrities sporting tattoos is said to have boosted the trend in body art, with Cheryl Cole's derriere design being just one of many from stars who choose to decorate themselves.

A few days ago, David Beckham stripped down to his swimming shorts on the beach - flashing a brand new design on the right side of his chest that brought his tattoo collection up to a whopping total of 33.

TV presenter Ferne Cotton recently said she regretted 'one or two' of her tattoos - then made a quick U-turn in an interview today with Cosmopolitan, saying she has stopped caring what other people think about her and her tattoos.

'I don't give a c*** what people think anymore. I don't care if people say they don't like my tattoos,' she said. 'They are all a part of who I am.'

Even in these trying economic times, the tattoo industry is booming, with the number of tattoo parlours in the UK rising from around 300 in the early 2000s to more than 1,500 today.

And the trend isn't entirely new either - Winston Churchill's mother Jennie had a small snake on her wrist, while King George V, before he was crowned, had a dragon inked on his arm during a visit to Japan in 1882.

The instrument used to create the designs today - the twin-coil electromagnetic tattoo needle - was patented in 1891.

And tattoos go back to ancient times, with Otzi the Iceman - a prehistoric man discovered in Austria who lived 5,300 years ago - having marks of 57 tattoos on his body.

But none of Otzi's tatts - mostly dots and lines - quite match up to these skull sketches.
