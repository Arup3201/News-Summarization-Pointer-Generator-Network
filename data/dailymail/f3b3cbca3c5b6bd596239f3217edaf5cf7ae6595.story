Callum Greenaway's letters of apology earned him a slashed prison sentence

A serial thief who admitted more than 70 burglaries had his sentence halved after he wrote letters to his victims claiming drugs forced him to steal.

Callum Greenaway, 26, stole £200,000 worth of goods from homes and businesses in a spate of burglaries described by a judge as ‘immense’.

But he escaped the typical five-year sentence for his crimes after writing apologies to those he  burgled, telling them it was ‘nothing personal’.

Last night one of his victims said she was unimpressed with the apology, and it did nothing to help ease the upset of losing treasured family jewellery.

Greenaway, a career criminal with a 12-year history of offending, faced up to his latest crimewave after he was charged with stealing jewellery during three break-ins at homes in Leigh-on-Sea in Essex.

He admitted a further four commercial burglaries, 47 house burglaries and 12 attempted house burglaries in Essex, as well as seven burglaries in Suffolk.

The court heard how Greenaway’s previous offences included being drunk and disorderly, dishonesty, possession of drugs, and assaulting a police officer.

He previously served three years in a young offenders institution for robbery and in 2008 received a suspended sentence for burglary and handling stolen goods.

But during sentencing, Maria Dineen said her client was clean from drugs and should be given credit for showing remorse.

In one of the letters to victims read out in court, Greenaway wrote: ‘I burgled your house because I was abusing drugs. I had no concept of remorse.

‘I only cared about one thing at the time and that’s me and getting money for drugs. I hope this letter gives you closure. I hope you realise there was nothing personal about the offence; I did not target you or your family.’

Greenaway had originally been charged with three burglaries in nearby Leigh-on-Sea, before admitting to a host of other crimes

Judge John Lodge, at Southend Crown 
Court, said Greenaway had ‘embarked on a catalogue of house burglaries 
of an immense nature’.

Judge Lodge said the scale of Greenaway's crimes was 'immense'

He said the starting point for sentencing would 
normally be five years’ custody, but because Greenaway pleaded guilty 
and tried to ‘wipe the slate clean’ he would cut this to two-and-a-half 
years.

One of Greenaway’s victims last night said she did not believe he had turned over a new leaf.

The woman, who did not wish to be 
named, added that Greenaway had done nothing to help trace jewellery 
belonging to her mother and grandfather that he took from her 
four-bedroom detached home in Leigh-on-Sea.

She said: ‘I don’t think that (the 
letter) will help because I don’t have much faith it’s going to make a 
difference. I feel quite cynical.’

Last November, Greenaway stole 
jewellery belonging to her mother, who died months earlier, and a  
signet ring that belonged to her grandfather, who was killed in the 
First World War.

She said: ‘At the time, I thought I’d
really like to talk to him and see if he realises the upset he’s 
caused. These people look at a home like mine and think “big house means
lots of money”, but that’s not always the case.’
