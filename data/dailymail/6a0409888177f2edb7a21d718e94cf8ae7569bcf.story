On the front line at 13: Stories about Private Sidney Lewis appeared in newspapers at the time but were not corroborated until now

A 13-year-old boy who ran away to join up fought on the front line in the First World War until his mother sent his birth certificate to the War Office and pleaded that he should be sent home.

Sidney Lewis, who has been recognised as Britain's youngest soldier to serve in the Great War, enlisted with the East Surrey Regiment in August 1915, five months after his 12th birthday, and was fighting on the Somme by the age of 13.

But within weeks he was ordered home to his mother, Fanny Lewis, in Tooting, south London, after she told officials he was too young to fight and should be sent back.

Stories about the child fighting on the frontline were printed in papers at the time, but they were never corroborated until now.

This weekend the Imperial War Museum in London declared Private Lewis the youngest authenticated fighting soldier after examining papers provided by his only son, Colin.

The bundle included Sidney's birth certificate and letters from the War Office to his mother promising he would be sent home immediately.

One telegram sent to Sidney's mother Fanny from the officer in charge of records at the Machine Gun Corps on 24 August 1916 read: 'Madam, your application on behalf of your son, and birth certificate, have been forwarded here by the War Office.

'I have to inform you that action has been taken and the lad will be discharged with all possible speed.'

And a letter sent to Mrs Lewis the day before from the War Office's director of recruiting said: 'With reference to your letter relative to your son, Private SG Lewis, Machine Gun Corps, I am directed to inform you that telegraphic instructions have been issued that he is to be at once with drawn from the firing line and sent home for discharge.

'On arrival in this country he will be discharged from the Army forthwith.'

It is believed Sidney, who is said to have had the physique of an older man, tricked enlisting officers into letting him sign up.  He underwent six months of training before being sent to France to fight.

He was awarded the Victory Medal and 
the British War Medal for his service in the Great War, in which he was 
deployed to France with the 106th Machine Gun Company and saw active 
service including six weeks fighting in the Battle of Somme.

Sidney's son Colin Lewis told the Sunday Times that Sidney's mother 'ruled the roost at home'.

He said: 'He told me he fought in the Battle of the Somme but I thought he was telling fibs because he was so  young.'

The War Office wrote to Mrs Lewis to say her son would be 'at once withdrawn from the firing line'

Anthony Richards, of the Imperial War Museum (IWM), said: 'This is certainly the youngest First World War soldier that we hold documents for in IWM’s archives.

'His story is quite phenomenal; not 
only did he enlist at the age of 12 and fight on the Somme at the age of
 13, but he returned to service at the end of the First World War and 
worked in bomb disposal during the Second World War.

'He was obviously a very tenacious man and undeterred by his early experiences.'

Sidney, one of eight children whose father was a hospital nurse, was among thousands of boys 
thought to have tricked enlisting officers into letting them sign up, 
but the youngest known to have done so.

Sidney Lewis' birth certificate shows he was born in March 1903 and thus was only 12 when he enlisted

Author Richard van Emden, who wrote Boy Soliders Of The Great War, said Sidney signed up in the summer holidays of 1915, at a time when many boys signed up, unaware of how bloody it the war would be.  Few, however, saw active combat.

Sidney fought in the Battle of 
Delville Wood, scene of some of the most ferocious fighting in the 
Battle of the Somme, which left around 500,000 men wounded or killed.  
It was after six weeks at the frontline that he was plucked from the 
trenches and sent home to his mother.

His brother-in-law Sidney Bardell, 94, said: 'I'm told he more or less ran away from home to enlist.'

But he could not explain why it took Sidney's mother a year to contact the War Office.

Despite being sent home, the irrepressible Sidney went on to re-enlist in 1918 and served in Austria with the army of occupation after the Armistice.  He later joined the police force and worked in bomb disposal during the Second World War.

His son said his father was 'a forthright fellow' who continued to ignore authority throughout his life until he died at the age of 63 in 1969.

Pte Lewis' story will be one of thousands told in a new IWM website, Lives Of The First World War, which will tell the story of those who served at home and abroad. The website will go live in February.
