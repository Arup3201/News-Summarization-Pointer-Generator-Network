Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham has blasted the privatisation as 'cost-cutting at its crudest'

Thousands have been forced to wait more than two hours to get to hospital after an ambulance service was taken over by a private bus company to cut costs.

The controversial privatisation has seen Arriva Transport Solutions receive more than 400 complaints in just six months of running the fleet in Greater Manchester - more than double the original service.

And one grieving daughter blames the service for the death of her mother - who died of a heart attack after waiting more than two hours before resorting to a taxi.

The conflict is the latest in a series of attacks on privatisation deals across the country, which was branded 'cost-cutting at its crudest'.

The contract, which Arriva won after undercutting the North West Ambulance Service by £3.5million, stipulates 80 per cent of patients should be collected within 60 minutes, and 90 per cent within 90 minutes.

This year, Arriva Passengers Ltd also took over South West Ambulance Services Trust in Gloucestershire.

The nation's largest private ambulance firm, Medical Services Ltd, a Danish company, operates in London, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and North West England.

It is a lucrative business as the company's accounts show a turnover of £29m, gross profits of £7m, and operating profits of £577,000 since the takeover.

A Freedom of Information request shows that 8,460 patients waited for more than two hours for Arriva to pick them up between April and September.

Since April 1, almost 250 complained they waited more than 90 minutes for the 'Ambuline' service, while 70 did not receive transport at all.

Others blasted the newly-privatised service for lack of information, poor medical care, and the drivers' attitudes.

Further freedom of Information requests, submitted by Labour, revealed increases on spending by three English ambulance services on private contractors in the last two years.

The biggest rise in spending was in London which saw a tenfold increase in the amount spent increase from £400,000 in 2010/11 to £4.2million in 2012/13.

South East Coast Ambulance service spent £7.3million up from £1.9million in 2010/11 while in Yorkshire the spend on private contractors went up from £500,000 to £1.8million.

Arriva Transport Solutions was appointed to provide non-emergency medical journeys across the region from April.

Any patient that calls 999 with a condition that is not life-threatening or desperately urgent is told to expect an Ambuline service.

It undercut the North West Ambulance Service (NWAS), an NHS trust, by £3.5million to secure the deal.

Figures,
 obtained using Freedom of Information laws, show Arriva received 411 
complaints in its first six months of running the service in Greater 
Manchester.

Complaints 
peaked at almost 150 in April, dropping to 89 in May, 58 in June, 51 in 
July, 45 in August, 21 in September, and 32 in October.

Lucy Powell, MP for Manchester Central, said: 'Because of the decision to put profit ahead of patients, hundreds of people are not getting the treatment they deserve.

'Arriva owes all those affected an apology and if the service is not urgently improved, then it should lose its contract.'

A spokesman for Blackpool Clinical Commissioning Group, which awards contracts for ambulance transport in the north west, said bosses are ‘happy’ with how the Arriva contract is going.

One patient's family slammed their service as a shambles after a series of delays taking her to hospital.

Annette Connelly, 56, suffered a heart attack in March - which her daughter, Caroline, partly blames on the stress caused by poor service.

Mrs Connelly, a diabetic, had been travelling from her home on in Manchester to have kidney dialysis at Manchester Royal Infirmary.

On five out of six occasions in the first week, the company or the hospital ordered her a taxi because drivers were not available - while she was twice left for more than two hours with other frail patients because Arriva hadn't turned up.

On April 4, Mrs Connelly was taken to hospital by ambulance after suffering a diabetic fit shortly after arriving home hours late.

Days later she was admitted to hospital after suffering a heart attack - before passing away there after a second heart attack on April 17.

Caroline, 28, blames Arriva for the ordeal.

She said: 'I think that it was the beginning of the end. It's not that my mum wasn't ill before, but if it wasn't for Arriva and them setting off that catalogue of events, I believe there would be a chance that she would still be here today.'

ATSL (Arriva Transport Solutions) has apologised to Mrs Connelly's family - and said it has investigated and addressed teething problems experienced in the early part of the contract.

Dennis Hajdukiewicz, head of Greater Manchester for ATSL, said: 'I offer my sincere condolences to Ms Connelly and her family at this very difficult time.

'Ensuring that we deliver a safe and reliable service to our patients is our highest priority and as such I am very sorry to hear about Mrs Connelly's experiences. We have undertaken a full investigation to find out exactly how and why Mrs Connelly experienced such unacceptable delays, so that we can identify any actions that we need to take, to help avoid a repeat of this in the future.

'We are committed to ensuring that patients across Greater Manchester receive the very highest quality non-emergency patient transport service.'

'We have been liaising with Ms Connelly regarding our investigation, and will provide the full findings and any resulting actions, in writing to her, as she has requested.'

Attacking the private deals across the UK as 'cost-cutting at
 its crudest', shadow health secretary Andy Burnham blasted Jeremy Hunt 
for putting patient safety at risk.

He
 said: 'It is proof that the Coalition sees no limits on privatisation 
in the NHS. They are driving the private sector into the public core of 
the NHS, offering up essential emergency provision to the lowest bidder.

'Whistleblowers
 have contacted Labour with concerns that even the most serious 999 
calls are being handled by private ambulances without properly trained 
staff and equipment.

'This
 is cost-cutting privatisation at its crudest, with a real risk that 
patient safety will be compromised. Jeremy Hunt must provide urgent 
assurances about the quality and safety of these private services.'

Earlier this year, the Care Quality 
Commission blasted Arriva's poor staff training, staff shortages and 
failing to keep records of whether vehicles were properly cleaned to 
avoid infection.
