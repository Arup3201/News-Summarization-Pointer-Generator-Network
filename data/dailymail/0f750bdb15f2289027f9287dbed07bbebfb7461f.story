Victim: Islan Nettles, 21, slipped into a coma after being attacked on Thursday. She died five days later

A transgender woman in New York has died after being beaten by a group of men who attacked her and yelled gay slurs.

The victim, 21-year-old Islan Nettles, died Thursday in a Harlem hospital when she was taken off life support five days following the attack.

The attacker, a 20-year-old man named Paris Wilson, was arrested for assault but now that the victim has died he may face murder charges.

The attack on Nettles was the latest in a spate of bias incidents this year in New York and a total of 68 have been reported so far this year, showing a significant increase from the 54 that were reported in all of last year.

Nettles and a friend, another transgender woman, were out Saturday evening in Harlem when they ran into a group of men and one pounced, punching Nettles in the face, police said.

The New York Post reports that the attack took place after Wilson began flirting with Nettles, before he realized she was transgendered.

Once that became clear, his friends started teasing him and he proceeded to attack her.

Hate crime: A witness told police that the attackers yelled gay slurs at Nettles, who was walking down a street in Harlem with other transgender women

After the attack, Nettles was hospitalized, slipped into a coma and later died.

The
 witness eventually told detectives about the anti-gay remarks- after 
initially leaving them out of the criminal report- and the hate crimes 
task force took over the investigation.

Detectives are looking whether the suspect had propositioned Nettles.

Upgraded charges are possible following the medical examiner's ruling, police said.

Nettle's sister, Elana, said in an interview Friday that she and her mother were coping well so far but did not comment further.

The bias attacks this year range from yelled slurs to the May killing of a 32-year-old gay man in Greenwich Village. Police stepped up patrols this summer in response.

In May, police said Mark Carson, 32, was first taunted with homophobic slurs, then shot in the head in Greenwich Village, not far from the site of 1969 riots that helped give rise to the gay rights movement.

A suspect was arrested on a charge of murder as a hate crime. The killing, and other bias attacks, sparked a summer protest attended by thousands.

Too late: Nettles was in a coma at Harlem Hospital for five days before she died on Thursday

Some of the other bias incidents this summer included an assault last week where two men were attacked in Chelsea.

Christine Quinn, the city's first openly gay City Council speaker and a mayoral candidate, denounced the most recent attack.

'An attack against one person, or one community, is an assault against all New Yorkers,' she said in a joint statement with other council members.

'We ask all New Yorkers to come together, to embrace our differences and to denounce hate violence.'
