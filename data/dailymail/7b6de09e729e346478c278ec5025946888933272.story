This is the dramatic moment that a Syrian fighter jet was shot down by an Israeli missile.

Israel said that the jet - identified as a Russian-made Sukhoi Su-24 - had crossed the battle
lines of Syria's civil war and flew over its Golan
Heights territory, perhaps by accident.

The incident coincided with but did not appear to be
directly related to air strikes the United States and Gulf Arab
allies mounted on Islamic State strongholds in Syria.

But it presented another challenge to Israel's oft-stateddesire to stay on the sidelines of a conflict on its northerndoorstep, in which al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front rebels took overa border crossing on the Golan last month.

The Israeli military said its U.S.-made Patriot missile air
defence system shot down a Syrian Russian-built Sukhoi fighter
plane that had 'infiltrated Israeli airspace' over the
territory, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.

It was the first time in three decades that Israel had
downed a Syrian warplane.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which tracks
violence in the civil war, said the warplane had been bombing
areas outside Quneitra, a Syrian town near the Israeli-held side
of the frontier, at the time it was shot down. It said the pilot
had bailed out.

Syria described the downing of the aircraft as an act of
aggression.

Israeli Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon, commenting on the
incident, said Israel 'will not allow any element - neither a
state nor a terrorist group - to threaten our security and
violate our sovereignty'.

Israeli military sources said the plane apparently crossed
by accident into Israeli-controlled airspace.

In his statement, Yaalon also seemed to raise that
possibility, saying Israel would respond strongly to perceived
threats 'whether they stemmed from a mistake or were
deliberate'.

Israel has fired into Syrian territory on numerous occasions
in response to shelling on the Golan that the military has said
was largely spillover from fighting between rebels and the
Syrian Army.

An Israeli Patriot missile destroyed a Syrian drone over the
Golan on August 31.

Israel last downed a manned Syrian aircraft in
1985, when Israeli fighters on a surveillance mission over
Lebanon destroyed two Syrian MiG-23s that approached them.

The downing of the jet came as Israeli soldiers killed two Palestinians suspected of the abduction and murder of three Israeli teens - the crisis that spiralled into a seven-week assault on Gaza.

Security forces had spent months hunting Marwan Kawasme and Amar Abu Aysha, militants in their 30s from the Hebron area, after naming them as the killers of the Israeli teens.
