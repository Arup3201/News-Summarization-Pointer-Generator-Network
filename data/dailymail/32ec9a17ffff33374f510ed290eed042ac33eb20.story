Last year it was the enduring friendship of a hare and a bear that melted our hearts.

Twelve months on, John Lewis hopes the bond between a boy and a penguin will similarly capture the public’s imagination.

This year’s two-minute festive commercial tells the story of seven-year-old Sam, played by actor Rhys Edwards from Hertfordshire, and his friend Monty.

This year's John Lewis Christmas ad tells the story of seven-year-old Sam, left, and his penguin friend Monty 

During the commercial, the boy eventually realises that Monty is longing for a penguin companion of his own

The boy gradually realises Monty is longing for a penguin companion. And so on Christmas morning Sam surprises Monty with the gift of a new penguin friend named Mabel.

The soundtrack is John Lennon’s song Real Love, performed by Tom Odell.

The company has spent £1million creating the ad, while £7million will be spent on the marketing campaign.

Ever since 2009, the chain’s commercials have proved to be the most popular of all those offered by retailers at Christmas.

All have managed to deliver an emotional and powerful story, generating a buzz on social media with many viewers happy to admit they have been reduced to tears.

More importantly, their popularity has been central to boosting sales growth at the retail giant which has been the envy of the high street.

The ad concludes with Sam surprising Monty on Christmas morning with the gift of a new penguin friend called Mabel 

The record of success means there is huge pressure on the company, its advertising agency and the commercial’s director to ensure John Lewis remains at number one.

Last year, John Lewis relied on traditional Disney animation techniques to create the story of the bear and the hare.

The success of the recent John Lewis Christmas commercials has been heavily founded on the soundtrack songs designed to pluck at the heart strings.

In 2009, the soundtrack to images of children morphing into adults as they unwrapped their presents was a version of the Guns N’ Roses song Sweet Child O’ Mine, recorded by the Swedish folk band, Taken By Trees.

Other successful choices included a version of The Smiths ‘Please, Please, Please let me get what I want’.

Two years ago, the commercial featured a snowman’s determined trek to find his loved one a perfect gift to a version of The Power of Love by young English singer, Gabrielle Aplin. And last year, Lily Allen reached number one with her take on Keane’s hit ‘Somewhere Only We Know’.

This year, the company is turning to John Lennon and the track Real Love, which will be performed by Tom Odell under the slogan ‘Give Someone The Christmas They’ve Been Dreaming Of’.

The ad launches on the retailer’s social media channels today and will screen on television tomorrow during the first advert break in Gogglebox on Channel 4.

John Lewis marketing director Craig Inglis said: ‘At John Lewis, this time of year is all about helping our customers create their dream Christmas.

The soundtrack to the commercial is the John Lennon track Real People, which is performed by Tom Odell 

‘We hope this uplifting tale of Sam’s love for his friend Monty will remind people of the magic of Christmas through a child’s eyes and inspire them to think how they can make the festive season extra special for their friends and loved ones.’

John Lewis stores will selling themed merchandise around the marketing campaign and creating spaces in its stores called Monty’s Den, which feature ‘technology firsts’ such as Monty’s Magical Toy Machine and Monty’s Goggles that use Microsoft technology and Google Cardboard to allow children to enter a virtual world and interact with the characters.

Merchandise includes a children’s book called Monty’s Christmas, where a proportion of the proceeds will go to Barnardo’s, plus stuffed toys, an umbrella and pyjamas.
