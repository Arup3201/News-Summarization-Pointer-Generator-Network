US drugs giant Pfizer took £67million more from the UK Government than it paid in tax over a three-year period.

The firm shelled out £118million in corporation tax between 2010 and 2012 – but received a whopping £184million in tax credits.

The rebate comes despite it making almost £5billion in sales from its British operations over the period.

The figures, revealed in documents filed at Companies House, come as the multinational was criticised for building up £43billion in tax havens across the world.

Data for the most recent trading period show that the US group's main British arm, Pfizer Limited, received a tax credit of £184.8million in 2011 after racking up losses of £759.7million.

It paid £5.4million into public coffers the year after. The rebate also dwarfs the tax paid by Pfizer's 22 other UK subsidiaries over the three-year period.

One, PowderMed Limited, received a tax credit of £703,000 in 2010 after significant losses. But it gave the Treasury just £8,000 in 2011, and £82,000 the following year.

A further division, John Wyeth & Brother Limited, made profits of £56.5million in 2012, but paid tax of only £3.5million – a rate of only 6 per cent. Meridian Medical Technologies Limited's tax bill was zero in 2010, even though it made a profit of £3,778.

Together, Pfizer's UK divisions made combined profits of £266million in 2012 but paid only £31million in tax – a rate of just 11.7 per cent.

The US company has already admitted that moving its tax base out of the US is 'one of the key drivers' of its £63billion plans to buy British drugs giant AstraZeneca. The group has almost 200 offices registered in tax havens across the world where it has an estimated £43billion nestled away.

Some 40 per cent of its subsidiaries are based in offshore shelters or low tax regimes such as the Cayman Islands, the Netherlands, Jersey and the US state of Delaware – a highly controversial tax shelter.

Tax accountant Richard Murphy said: 'At a time when the world needs new antibiotics, Pfizer is investing in tax avoidance.'

Pfizer said it pays its 'fair share' of taxes wherever it does business. A spokesman added that because of restructuring and investment costs, Pfizer generated losses in the UK in 2011.
