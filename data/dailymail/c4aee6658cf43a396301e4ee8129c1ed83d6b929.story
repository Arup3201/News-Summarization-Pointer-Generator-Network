John Terry took to Instagram to post a nostalgic photo of his youth club, Senrab FC.

Terry shared the picture to his 158,400 followers of him holding a silver trophy alongside his victorious team-mates, alongside the caption: 'What a team this was back in the day'.

The Chelsea captain is alongside the likes of Ledley King, Bobby Zamora and Jlloyd Samuel, all of whom have enjoyed successful Premiers League.

The Forest Gate based club had to be bailed out by Terry back in 2011 after a desperate financial struggle almost saw them slip from existence. Upon making a donation to save the club, the defender told Sportsmail: 'I’m sure this will help secure the long-term future of the club.'

Retired Tottenham centre half Ledley King also added: 'The thought of this club folding is a worrying one. I owe Senrab a lot.'

The Sunday league outfit have also been responsible for bringing up a wealth of talent either side of Terry’s age group. England regular Sol Campbell, striker Jermain Defoe and the ever-popular Adebayo Akinfenwa all played their grassroots football there.

The club, whose name originates from the name Barnes spelt backwards, have received coaching from Chelsea legend Ray Wilkins and former Charlton boss Alan Curbishley.

Terry clearly has strong feelings for the club where, for him, it all started. This latest post shows his reflection on the very beginning of his career which has included 78 England caps.
