Arms laden with parcels, the excited guests step into the opulent hotel reception before being whisked to a 'gift room'. As the door swings open they are greeted by a sea of exquisitely wrapped presents and instructed to leave theirs inside.

Next they are ushered to a waiting area and served miniature bottles of vintage champagne. Later they will feast at beautifully decorated tables, rounding off the meal with a slice cut from a towering, five-tiered cake.

It sounds like the kind of party organised by a wealthy celebrity but hostess Mel Panther, 31, from Beckenham in Kent, is not famous. And although the cash lavished on the occasion would pay for a traditional wedding reception, in fact her guests are celebrating the imminent arrival of a baby.

Indulgent: Mel, a trainee photographer and now mum to Lonnie, nine months, began planning her baby shower as soon as she found she was pregnant and ran up a bill of £10,000

Treated like royalty: Mel at her baby shower with her friends

'Baby showers' — parties thrown before the arrival of a newborn — are increasingly common in Britain, as mums-to-be here adopt a trend from America.

Mel, a trainee photographer and now mum to Lonnie, nine months, began planning hers as soon as she found she was pregnant.

'The plan was for it to be grand, girly and very special,' she says. 'I love entertaining, so this gave me an excuse to really push the boat out.'

When baby showers first caught on here, they were low-key affairs for a few close girlfriends at their pregnant friend's home. Now the shower has become a costly social event: a recent study found that women in Britain spend £220 million attending baby showers each year.

No wonder dozens of companies now offer baby shower gift-lists online, and there are even professional baby shower planners.

There was certainly no expense spared at Mel's party, generously funded by her stock trader boyfriend Oliver, 33.

'I'm Disney-obsessed,' says Mel, 'so when I found out I was having a girl I spent hours thinking of ways to incorporate the style of individual Disney princesses into each table.'

Mel hired a professional event organiser and together they chose the venue — an 18th-century hotel costing £1,500 — selected the £500 floral arrangements and commissioned a five-tiered Oreo biscuit-flavoured cake, which set Mel back £1,300.

Extras, including bespoke invitations, a photo booth where guests could take souvenir pictures, professional photography, and initialled wooden baby block favours for the 50 guests, led to an eye-watering final bill of £10,000.

Yet Mel, who was seven months pregnant at the party, insists it was worth it. 'Every single guest was gobsmacked,' she says. 'It was surprise after surprise. It definitely had the wow factor and seeing everyone's reactions made me so proud.'

Increasingly, baby showers seem to be taking the place of weddings for unmarried expectant women.

Zerena Martells, a 31-year-old HR manager who is not married to her partner Nick, 32, admits that, in the absence of a wedding, it was an excuse for a party.

'So many of my friends got married and had big dos, and I felt I was missing out,' she says. 'I convinced Nick that I deserved a special party but thankfully he has no idea how much I spent.'

Growing trend: Baby showers started in America and are becoming increasingly popular in Britain

Zerena toured London's finest afternoon tea venues, including five-star hotels The Dorchester and The Sanderson, before eventually opting for a quirky vintage tearoom in North London.

A menu of finger sandwiches, cupcakes and scones, along with table flowers, bespoke bunting and vintage china, set her back just shy of £1,000. Extras pushed the final bill to more than £1,500.

'At the time it didn't feel over-the-top,' says Zerena, now mum to Quinn, five months. 'I kept reminding myself that I deserved it, that my baby girl deserved it. Plus, I wanted to spoil my girlfriends and my family. What better excuse than being pregnant?'

Her guests bought gifts from a wish-list she compiled at Mothercare. 'I got everything I asked for, including a Moses basket, a baby walker and a high chair,' Zerena says. In the end she received more than £2,000 worth of gifts

This may sound lavish and materialistic but it is not unusual. A recent study revealed that one woman in eight splurges £100 before attending a baby shower, so an invitation certainly doesn't guarantee a cheap day out.

Ameeta Phull, 36, from Northwood, North-West London, copied a celebrity when she began organising her baby shower last year.

After reading about the star-studded event that High School Musical actress Vanessa Hudgens arranged for her sister, the accountant resolved to give herself the same VIP treatment when she became pregnant.

'I wanted an event that was glamorous, fancy and memorable,' says the married mum of 18-month-old Sahana.

Having saved £10,000, she could afford to think big — and she had a specific theme in mind.

'Gold is my favourite thing,' she says. 'That was the look I wanted for my classy, English-themed party. When I was four months pregnant and visited Buckinghamshire Golf Club and saw its enormous gold-framed pictures, I knew it was the venue for me.'

First she hired an event planner. After drawing up a 40-strong all-female guest list, the pair worked together to choose floral arrangements, decide on the menu and order generous party bags containing home-made jam, lollypop-shaped cakes and pink sweets.

The event organiser charged £2,500, which included finishing touches such as flowers. '

Champagne afternoon tea at the golf club was £1,500 for 40 of us,' says Ameeta, 'and when you factor in extras like a professional photographer and formal, gold-printed invitations, the whole event cost around £5,000.'

Luckily, Ameeta's husband Jaspal, 36, laughed off his wife's excesses when he discovered the cost. 'A few friends commented that I'd gone way over the top,' Ameeta says. 'One actually said the do was ridiculous and that never in a million years would she have spent that much. But no one could deny it was a beautiful event.'

Certainly the baby shower, held when Ameeta was six months pregnant, made her the centre of attention. From the moment she arrived at the 18th-century manor house last February, she was given the red-carpet treatment. After sinking her stilettos into the plush crimson walkway that had been unfurled to meet her at the car door, she had her hair styled and posed for professional photographs. In the vast function room she was greeted by a mountain of perfectly wrapped gifts.

She didn't have time to unwrap them before she was enjoying a luxury afternoon tea with lashings of pink lemonade and, after that, party games. Later in the afternoon Ameeta sat down in front of her guests and, one by one over the course of an hour, opened the presents they'd brought.

'It was such a lovely experience and the gifts just kept coming,' she says. 'I got a Burberry changing bag, a high chair, Ralph Lauren baby clothes and even two pairs of tiny Ugg boots.

'My guests had ordered online using a maternity concierge company, and the staff had wrapped the gifts and delivered them to the venue. So it was lovely for everyone to be able to see what they'd bought me. I was given so much — at least £1,000 worth.'

With hindsight, does Ameeta feels she might have gone a touch overboard? 'Not at all,' she says resolutely. 'I had an unforgettable, amazing day that people still talk about. Why not spoil yourself? I have absolutely no regrets.'
