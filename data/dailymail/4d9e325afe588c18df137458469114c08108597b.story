A Massachusetts man who bought a pair of lottery tickets at a grocery shop to break a $100 bill for lunch has ended up winning $10 million.

Lottery officials announced Thursday that Richard Noll and his wife Lisa claimed the prize at lottery headquarters in Braintree this week.

He chose a one-time payment of $6.5 million before taxes.

Big winnings: Richard Noll and his wife Lisa claimed the prize at lottery headquarters in Braintree this week. Noll bought a pair of tickets at a grocery shop to break a $100 bill for lunch and ended up winning $10 million

The Revere man says he needed to break a $100 bill to get lunch at a sandwich shop, so he bought two $20 'Platinum Millions' instant tickets at Lanzilli Groceria in East Boston.

The shop gets a $50,000 bonus for selling the winning ticket.

Lottery communications director Christian Teja told Itemlive.com that Noll's post-taxes prize money will come to $4.5 million.

Noll says he wants to buy a house, make investments and take his granddaughter to Walt Disney World.  

Lottery officials said in a release 'Noll is the third $10 million "Platinum Millions" prize winner since this instant game was launched in 2013. There are two additional $10 million prizes and sixteen $1 million prizes remaining in the game.'

The Blaze pointed out that there is a one in 5,040,000 chance of winning $10 million by playing 'Platinum Millions 2013.'
