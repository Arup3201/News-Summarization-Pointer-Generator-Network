Jason Dernbach received a caution despite admitting 113 offences during a three-year crime spree

A burglar has escaped with a caution despite admitting 113 offences.

Jason Dernbach, 24, was given the soft punishment after confessing to a three-year crime spree.

At the time he was behind bars for 26 separate offences.

Surrey Police, which made the decision, says it has suspended its policy of ‘multiple cautions’.

Kevin Hurley, the newly elected police and crime commissioner for the county, said he would investigate the case.

‘It seems that if someone has admitted
113 further offences then there ought to be an additional sanction for 
this,’ he added. ‘I’ve never known a burglar who is locked up in D Wing 
break into someone’s house.’

Last January, Dernbach, from Woking, 
was jailed for four-and-a-half years at Guildford Crown Court after 
admitting six burglary charges.

He confessed to another 15 thefts and four car break-ins and these were taken into consideration as part of the sentence.

The court heard that in 2011 he stole 
more than £20,000 of games consoles, laptops and digital cameras to pay 
for his drug habit. One offence took place while he was on police bail.

Behind bars he made further admissions
to the police of 113 burglaries and car break-ins between 2005 and 
2007. Officers could have chosen to prosecute but opted instead for a 
‘retrospective caution’.

Cautions appear on a criminal’s record but do not result in any further punishment.

At the same time they allow the force 
to declare a crime ‘solved’ and improve its conviction rate. Peter 
Cuthbertson, of the Centre for Crime Prevention, a think-tank, said: 
‘Each year thousands of repeat offenders receive a caution for serious 
offences like burglary.

‘Pathetic punishments like these only 
serve to prove career criminals right when they say getting caught is 
just an occupational hazard. Cautions should be reserved for minor 
offenders.’

Official figures show nearly 28,000 offenders were handed multiple cautions in 2011.

Of those, 3,531 were cautioned three times, 820 four times, 300 five times and 23 at least ten times.

In May last year a court heard how a serial burglar who was spared prison went on to commit 22 more raids in nine months.

Jason Reed, 39 and from Bristol, was 
handed a suspended jail term despite admitting 12 burglaries and having a
previous conviction for rape, indecent assault and false imprisonment.

On release he carried out another 22 home break-ins and was finally jailed for six years after admitting 49 other crimes.

Official figures show the average burglar now has around 12 break-ins on his record – the highest number ever logged.

And of those convicted last year more than 3,000 had been found guilty at least 20 times before.

In the year to June 2012 around half 
of all burglars escaped jail –with one in three given a community 
sentence and 11 per cent a suspended jail term.

A spokesman for Surrey Police said: 
‘Cautions for a large number of offences were only given out in 
exceptional circumstances and only when a specific set of criteria had 
been applied and met.

‘The criteria would include the 
offender having already received a significant custodial sentence and 
having the support of the victims.’ He said it brought closure for some 
victims.
