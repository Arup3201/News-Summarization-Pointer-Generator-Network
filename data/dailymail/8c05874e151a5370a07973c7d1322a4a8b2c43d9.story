Photo apps such as Instagram are now the worst annoyance on Facebook - beating other people's baby photos into second place.

One fifth of Facebook users have actually deleted friends on the social network because of annoying photos.

A poll of 1671 Facebook users found that the apps, which add effects such as retro-styled film to digital photos were the worst picture annoyance on Facebook.

Too arty? Facebook users said that photos taken with apps such as Instagram were their number-one annoyance on the site - beating baby photos into second place

Celebrities such as Jamie Oliver use the app to share their images with fans

In a poll of 1671 site users, photos taken with Instagram came out as the top irritation on the site, by the percentage of those polled who said they were irked by different 'photo irritations' on Facebook.

1) Images Taken with Photo Apps such as Instagram - 61%

2) Baby Photos- 58%

3) Obviously ‘Posed’ Photos - 53%

4) Holiday Photos - 46%

5) Food Photos - 32%

Users said that the main reason they hated apps such as Instagram was the 'unnecessary photographic effects'.

A quarter of site users said they found the apps 'Gimmicky' - and three quarters had taken action to prevent annoying photographs appearing in their news feeds.

Of those who had taken action, a fifth (21%) had actually deleted friends - and 61% had hidden someone's posts.

Instagram is just one of many 
photo-editing and photo-filter suites available for smartphones, 
users give it a top rating for the ease of applying filters and the very
simple way of sharing images via sites like Facebook and Twitter.

Instangram also allows users to share images through its own sharing website, which has proved immensely popular with fans.

Many
celebrities, from Jamie Oliver to Jessica Alba, also take advantage of 
the app, with Patrick Schwarzenegger using the app in the last few days 
to share his injuries following a skiing accident.

Photo-editor Instagram is one of the biggest apps on iPhone, and now seems poised to replicate that success on Android

Rebecca Huggler, Co-Founder of MyMemory.com, which conducted the survey said,'It was really interesting to see that a photo sharing app was the top
annoyance when it came to Facebook photos.

'From the results, it seems that
people either simply think that the photo effects the filters give are
unnecessary; or the apps are just seen as ‘gimmicky.'
