Liverpool midfielder Raheem Sterling returned to the training pitch at Melwood on Tuesday after the storm over his request not to start in England's 1-0 win over Estonia because he was too tired.

Sterling was seen doing sprints and dribbling with the ball at the Anfield Club's training ground as part of a stripped-down training session along with Steven Gerrard, Mario Balotelli and Glen Johnson.

The 19-year-old later received a lift home from Liverpool and England team-mate Jordan Henderson after the session.

Roy Hodgson left Sterling out of the starting line-up for England's 1-0 win over Estonia in Euro 2016 qualifying on Sunday after the young playmaker complained of feeling tired.

Sterling has become a key player for club and country this season and his increased time on the field appears to be taking its toll on the Liverpool star.

Hodgson is expected to hold talks with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers this week regarding their shared use of Sterling - and he could be left out of the trip to QPR on Sunday if deemed too tired again.

Sterling views criticism of him for complaining of tiredness as unfair after a difficult start to the new campaign - and appeared to speak out on Twitter against his detractors.

After coming off the bench in Tallinn, Sterling was fouled for the free-kick that led to Wayne Rooney's second-half winner that secured a perfect start to England's qualifying group with three wins from three games.
