Lord Justice Leveson last night dismissed criticism that his inquiry into Press standards had been undermined by revelations of an affair between two key lawyers.

He insisted there was ‘simply no room’ for a ‘breach of confidence or other conspiracy’ as a result of the relationship between Carine Patry Hoskins, a member of his legal team, and celebrities’ barrister David Sherborne.

But the High Court judge declined to answer a series of crucial questions about the relationship, which was revealed by the Daily Mail and has raised concerns over whether it undermined the integrity of his inquiry.

Affair: Celebrities' barrister Mr Sherborne and  Mrs Patry Hoskins, a 
member of Lord Justice Leveson’s legal team,  claim their relationship 
did not start until after the inquiry

Twice-married Mr Sherborne, 44, and Miss Patry Hoskins, 40, admit going on holiday together to Santorini in August – days after months of public hearings at the inquiry ended – but claim their affair did not begin until after the Leveson report was published in November.

The couple did not tell Lord Justice Leveson or his senior counsel, Robert Jay QC, about the affair. The judge only learnt of their trip to the Greek island – during which they say they discussed ‘the possibility of a future relationship’ – when the Mail asked him to comment on it.

MPs have demanded that Lord Justice Leveson launch a full investigation, and a series of questions about who knew what and when remain to be answered.

Last night Tory MP Nick de Bois said: ‘Lord Justice Leveson gives the impression of dismissing this out of hand. I would have thought in the interests of transparency that this would have deserved a more considered and substantive response.’

Carine Patry Hoskins: Questioned more than 50 witnesses

The Daily Mail put these questions to Lord Justice Leveson and his senior counsel at the inquiry, Robert Jay QC. We await their reply.

THE AFFAIR

Mr Jay says he first learnt of a ‘personal relationship of any sort’ between David Sherborne and Carine Patry Hoskins on March 18, 2013, and later informed Lord Justice Leveson.

But their relationship has apparently been the talk of fellow lawyers for a year and the couple were regularly seen having coffee in the Delaunay brasserie, close to the Royal Courts of Justice where they sat on opposite sides of the inquiry.

1: How did Mr Jay learn of the relationship?

2: Was he aware of legal gossip surrounding the couple circulating for up to a year?

3: What was he told of the affair and when did he inform Lord Justice Leveson?

4: Why did Mr Jay decide he should inform Lord Justice Leveson that Mr Sherborne and Miss Patry

Hoskins were in a relationship when he learned about it? Was it because he recognised it might give rise to a concern that the proper conduct of the inquiry may have been affected?

THE GREEK HOLIDAY

Both Lord Justice Leveson and Mr Jay say they only learnt of the Santorini holiday last week.

But the couple flew to the Greek island in August, a few days after the public hearings at the inquiry finished and three months before the publication of the Leveson report.

5: How and on what date did they discover the couple had travelled to the Greek island?

6: Do they think that they should have been consulted by Miss Patry Hoskins about any planned trip to Santorini? If they had been, what would have been their position?

7: Have Mr Sherborne or Miss Patry Hoskins been asked to make sworn statements about their relationship and the trip to Santorini?

THE ‘WOMAN ON THE LEFT’

Lord Justice Leveson said at the weekend: ‘There is no suggestion in the facts as we understand them to be that Ms Patry Hoskins’s work for the inquiry was in any way affected by her developing relationship with Mr Sherborne.’ The judge says Miss Patry Hoskins’s role after the public hearings – where she became known on social media as ‘woman on the left’ – ended in July was merely collating facts and proof reading. But during the public hearings she questioned more than 50 witnesses, including seven of Mr Sherborne’s clients. Her role was to be scrupulously independent.

8: Have Lord Justice Leveson or Mr Jay spoken directly to Mr Sherborne or Miss Patry Hoskins about their relationship?

9: What steps have been taken to ensure Miss Patry Hoskins’s collation of facts was not tainted by her relationship with Mr Sherborne?

10: Given that interested parties’ questions for witnesses could only be put via the inquiry legal team, are Lord Justice Leveson and Mr Jay content that Miss Patry Hoskins carried out her role entirely impartially?

BEST BEHAVIOUR

This was one of the most high-profile public inquiries. Senior legal sources with experience of Leveson-style proceedings say they would have warned their legal teams to be careful.

11: At the start of the inquiry, did Lord Justice Leveson or Mr Jay issue any guidance to the inquiry’s legal team about behaviour during the proceedings?

PUBLIC PERCEPTION

Questions have been raised about the perception of the impartiality of the inquiry as a result of the disclosure of the relationship between Mr Sherborne and Miss Patry Hoskins.

12: What comment do Lord Justice Leveson and Mr Jay have on this?

Rob Wilson, parliamentary aide to 
Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, wrote to the judge at the weekend 
urging him to examine the implications of the relationship. He said: ‘In
 the interests of transparency and in maintaining public confidence in 
the complete integrity and impartiality of your inquiry, I strongly urge
 you to make inquiries and to get to the bottom of this matter without 
delay.’

The Tory MP has also asked the Bar 
Standards Board to consider whether the two barristers have breached the
 Bar’s Code of Conduct.

In his reply to Mr Wilson yesterday, 
Lord Justice Leveson said he would not comment on ‘what, if any’ action 
the Board decides to take.

Not informed: Lord Justice Leveson was not told about the affair and only learned about the couple's holidaying together in the past week

‘As for the integrity and impartiality
 of the inquiry, I know exactly what work I asked Ms Patry Hoskins to do
 after August 3 (by which time the hearings had concluded) and I have 
reminded myself of the dates and precise work she did, in fact, 
undertake in the months that followed and the material to which she had 
access,’ he said.

MP letter: Rob Wilson wants Bar Standards Board to examine whether there may have been a breach of the code of conduct

‘I need to make no further inquiry: 
she did exactly what I had requested. She had absolutely no input into 
any conclusion as to the past treatment of those affected by Press 
abuses (or indeed the relationship between the Press and the public as 
considered by Module 1 of the inquiry) or any aspect of the proposals 
made for future Press regulation. She was simply not involved in any of 
this work.’

The judge, in his third statement in 
five days about the affair, said Miss Patry Hoskins’s involvement after 
August 3 was ‘confined to the collation of facts’ concerning the 
historical relationship between the Press and politicians. ‘In that 
period, save for some proof reading in the final few days before 
publication, she did not see and was not involved in any discussions 
about the other sections of the report or, indeed, in any of my eventual
 recommendations,’ he said. ‘There was simply no room for a ‘‘breach of 
confidence or other conspiracy’’ as a result of personal relations 
between her and Mr Sherborne.’ Mr Wilson was disappointed with Lord 
Justice Leveson’s response.

He said: ‘Lord Justice Leveson seems 
to have accepted that the two barristers went on holiday “to discuss the
 possibility of a relationship” at face value. It is rather surprising 
that he seems unwilling to investigate whether anything was going on 
before this time.’ Mr Sherborne, a father of three, represented Hugh 
Grant and other phone-hacking victims at the inquiry whose public 
hearings ran from September 2011 to July 2012.

Miss Patry Hoskins, dubbed the 
‘thinking man’s Pippa Middleton’, was required to be totally independent
 when testing evidence given to the inquiry on behalf of the public. She
 questioned witnesses, including Mr Sherborne’s clients, with grievances
 against the Press, and trended on Twitter as #womanontheleft after 
being spotted by viewers who suggested she was making eyes at Mr Grant. 
She is understood to be divorcing her 45-year-old husband, QC Mark 
Hoskins.
