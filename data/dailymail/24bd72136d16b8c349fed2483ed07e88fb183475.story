Hernik raced for the KTM team. His body was found 300m from the course.

The 9,000km-long Dakar Rally runs through Argentina, Chile and Bolivia with the finish in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, on Jan. 17.

Hernik is the fifth competitor to die during racing since the rally came to South America in 2009. It started out as a gruelling and sometimes fatal race from Paris across the Sahara to the Senegalese capital Dakar.
