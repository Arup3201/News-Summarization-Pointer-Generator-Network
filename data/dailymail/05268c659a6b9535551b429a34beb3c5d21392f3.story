Investors have been treated to a Christmas bonus after more than £105billion was added to the value of Britain’s biggest companies in little over a week.

The FTSE 100 index gained another 21.44 points yesterday to close at 6598.18.

But it was not all good news as the pound fell against the US dollar, making holidays stateside more expensive for British travellers.

The FTSE has now jumped more than 400 points, or 6.7 per cent, in the last six trading sessions, adding £105.6billion to the value of blue-chip firms since early last week.

The so-called ‘Santa Rally’, when the stock prices surge in the festive period, is good news for investors and workers saving for a pension who have money tied up in the markets.

However, the FTSE is still below the 6743 it reached early this month before tumbling oil prices, the crisis in Russia, and fears over the eurozone sent it crashing to a year low.

Sterling fell below $1.55 against a resurgent US dollar for the first time since August last year – a development that will make Christmas trips to America more expensive for UK travellers.

Meanwhile stock markets in America soared to record highs last night as ‘astounding’ figures showed the United States economy growing at its fastest pace for 11 years.

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average smashed through the 18,000 mark for the first time.

In contrast, there were signs that the UK economy is slowing as the year comes to an end.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed gross domestic product – the total size of the economy – rose by a healthy 0.7 per cent between July and September.

But that was lower than the 0.8 per cent growth seen in the second quarter of the year. Output was only 2.6 per cent higher than in the same period of last year, far less than the 3 per cent increase previously reported.

The ONS report also showed the economy grew by less than expected in the previous five quarters meaning the recovery since early last year was weaker than thought. 

David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ‘The stark revision in annual growth confirms that the pace of recovery is slowing.’

But analysts said the recent slump in the price of oil – a drop from $115 a barrel in June to below $60 last night – will breathe new life into the economy in 2015 as tumbling petrol prices leave households with more money to spend.

Former Bank of England economist Rob Wood, now at Berenberg Bank, said: ‘The oil price rout is like a big tax cut for consumers, and UK consumers tend to spend extra income.

‘In our view, now is the time to be optimistic about the UK. A tax cut funded by Russia and the Middle East and falling mortgage rates should combine in a powerful cocktail that boosts UK growth next year.’

Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the Ernst & Young Item Club, said: ‘Looking ahead to 2015 the UK may experience some softening in growth.

‘However, the plunge in oil prices promises to provide the economy with renewed momentum, by improving household purchasing power and boosting global growth.

‘Overall, the chance that growth in output in 2015 could outpace 2014’s expansion cannot be ruled out.’

In the US, official figures showed the American economy grew at an annual rate of 5 per cent in the third quarter of the year – its best performance for 11 years.
