Larger women are being charged more for having their legs waxed at a beauty salon - because they use up more materials than skinnier women.

Clients at the MM Bubbles salon in London's upmarket South Kensington are being hit with a 'fat tax' of £5 if they are a size 12 or above.

Larger women, who are a size 18 or more could be charged £10 more than the standard charge for the 45 minute treatment.

'Fat tax': A London beauty salon has slapped an additional charge on women above a size 12 who have their legs waxed

According to The Sun, the price hike on the treatment, which is currently advertised at £21 due to a promotional offer, has left some women angry.

The paper tested the additional charge by sending a size 22-24 model to the salon to see whether she was charged extra.

She was charged £26 - an additional £5 to the advertised price.

The salon owner reportedly told the model, named only as Helen: 'I know maybe for you it is not very nice but I use more stuff.'

Helen told The Sun: 'Luckily, I'm okay with my size.

'But for other women worried about their weight this could really devastate them.'

Another woman, who was a size 14-16 was reportedly charged an extra £10.

The charge applies to women who are a size 12 or larger despite the average UK dress size currently being 16.

Christina Damela, one of the salon's beauty therapist, confirmed that additional charges for leg waxes are applied to larger women.
