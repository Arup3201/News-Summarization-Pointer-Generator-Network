'Prepario trotta!' exclaims Fabio, as he flicks the reins on our horse and carriage, and we are off, bouncing along a dirt track through olive trees.

We're in the heart of the Fasano countryside in Puglia, the heel of Italy. Our children Maisie, five, and Imogen, three, are holding on tight.

Fabio chuckles: 'In Italy we always like to look after the ladies!' We pass workers raking the arid earth so the olives can fall on the ground. 

Trulli, madly deeply: The conical stone house Trulli of Alberobello is touristy but cute

A three-wheel truck is laden with crates of them, and on the wind comes the scent of a bonfire burning the fallen leaves and branches. 

Puglia is defined by the olive. Not only does it have the oldest tree in Italy - more than 2,000 years old - it produces 40 per cent of the country's olives and is renowned for manufacturing the finest olive oil.

Back at the stables, Fabio introduces us to his shaggy Shetland pony, Emma, and the girls ride around the paddock.

We are staying at the Masseria Torre Maizza, a beautiful old country house turned hotel on the eastern coast.

Masseria is a Puglian term for a country house fortified against attacks in former times by Turks or pirates. The ramparts of the whitewashed Maizza have been converted into a Moroccan-style roof terrace, with idyllic views over the pool and nine-hole golf course.

The hotel has a private beach club, a short shuttle ride away, where we roam over dunes and splash in the surf.

There are beautifully preserved medieval villages to visit: we plump for the famous conical stone house Trulli of Alberobello. It's touristy, but cute.

One day we organise a cookery lesson at neighbouring Masseria Torre Coccaro, owned by the same family. We meet Cossimo the chef in the huge underground limestone cavern that was the 18th-century olive oil pressing room.

We start with bowls of flour that Caroline, my wife, and the girls take great pleasure in mixing and kneading. Imogen climbs on the ball of dough.

Pasta way to do it: Felix and family try their hand at pasta making in an 18th-century olive oil pressing room

'Have you seen that technique before?' I ask Cossimo. 'No, it's a first.'

We shape pizzas and panzerotti stuffed with tomato and mozzarella - the Puglian version of a calzone/pastry hybrid - plus a chocolate version for the children, before trying our hand at pasta.

We make the Puglian classic ear-shaped orecchiette and a taglioni that Maisie takes great pleasure in pushing through the pasta machine.

Food informs our other day out, a gastronomic bike tour. Bikes with child seats are available to borrow at the hotel. It proves as much fun as the horses.

First stop is a mozzarella farm. Giant paddles are hoisted overhead to stretch the cheese. The cheese-maker twists up mozzarella and ricotta-stuffed burrata and we dig in at the tasting table.

Next up is Masseria Maccarone to see the old stone olive press and try its famed oil. From there we pedal on to the nearby fishing village of Savelletri for a late lunch at the Pescheria.

Owned by four consecutive generations of local fishermen and serving only fish, the Pescheria may just be one of my all-time favourite restaurants. We try the carpaccio catch of the day of six different types of raw fish and prawns.

We cap lunch off with home-made ice cream at the seafront gelateria, watching the gulls circle and waves crash onto the harbour. We feel wellheeled indeed in the heel of Italy.
