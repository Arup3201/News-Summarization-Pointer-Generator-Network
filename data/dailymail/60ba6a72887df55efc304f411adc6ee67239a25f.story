The Deception Bay stand-off began just an hour after another man surrendered to police at Inala in Brisbane's south, in an unrelated siege.

Negotiators had worked since around lunchtime on Saturday to get a man allegedly armed with a machete and a hand gun to give himself up.

He eventually surrendered peacefully and was taken to hospital for assessment.

Neighbours told ABC News, they believed the man was upset after breaking up with his girlfriend.

No charges were laid.
