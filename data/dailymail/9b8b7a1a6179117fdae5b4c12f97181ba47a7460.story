Renee Olah, founder of Chance at Life Cat Rescue, who spent some of her own money try to save Quattro's Life. She and police want to honor the 14-year-old boy who scared the gang of children away

Quattro's attackers, all under the age of 10, have been suspended from school for five days and will receive counseling

The poor kitty might have died at the scene, except that two older kids -- brothers --  stepped in and chased the brutal gang away.

My brother told me they were hitting the cat, and I went over there and the cat was on the floor and couldn't breathe. He was still throwing bricks on his head and I pushed him out of the way,' one of the brothers told WABC.

One brother, 14, cared for the animal at home for two days until a teacher learned of the incident, the New York Daily News reported.

Renee Olah, founder of Hackensack-based Chance at Life Cat Rescue, took the cat  to an animal hospital for life-saving surgery.

'When I got the call, I didn’t know what to expect,' Olah told NJ.com. 'Of course, when I saw him, it was something I’ll never forget.' Olah told NJ.com.

Qauttro might have died at the scene of the attack, except that two brothers stepped in and scared the gang of children away. One of them even cared for Quattro for several days

'It is disturbing to see what this animal went through,' said Passaic County SPCA agent Luis Vasquez.

'The principal has met with the students' parents, and the students have received a five-day suspension,' Terry Corallo, a Paterson schools spokeswoman said in a statement Wednesday. 'Upon their return to school, they will receive counseling.'

Olah and police want to honor the 14-year-old who chased the gang away and cared for Quattro, WCBS reported.

A cat rescuer and police want to honor a 14-year-old boy who chased off a group of children torturing a cat in Paterson and then brought the feline home in an effort to save him.

The children responsible for the abuse 'are a horrific part of the story, but there’s also a hero,' Olah said. 'And I want to get that out so kids his age, or any age for that matter, know what to do.'
