A total of 14 people were arrested and four taken to hospital as around 30,000 revellers poured into a county town for its renowned Bonfire Night celebrations.

The streets of Lewes in East Sussex - dubbed the bonfire capital of the world - were turned into a riot of colour and noise as rival bonfire societies paraded through.

A total of 86 people were treated by South East Coast Ambulance Service and St John Ambulance, with four people needing hospital treatment. None of the injuries were believed to be serious.

East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service 
reported a quiet night, with fire crews called out to deal with six 
incidents, including an out of control bonfire.Of the 14 arrests, 
Sussex Police said two were for throwing fireworks and others were for 
being drunk and disorderly and public order offences.

Police said there were no serious incidents of violence or disorder among the crowd, and the number of arrests and injuries were on a par with last year.

Superintendent Laurence Taylor, the event's police commander, said: 'The Lewes Bonfire continues to be an incredibly popular event. At public events of this size there is always the potential for incidents of criminal activity and anti-social behaviour.'

He added:'The policing of this event involves 
months of preparation, planning and consultation with the bonfire 
societies, the other emergency services and partners with the main aim 
being to help provide a safe environment for the participants and 
spectators on the night.

'Around
 18,000 people travelled into Lewes by train and officers from both 
British Transport Police and Sussex Police were on hand to help manage 
the crowds and minimise the risk of injuries and damage to property.

'I
 would particularly like to thank the stewards who worked really hard 
along the processional route and made sure there were no crowd issues 
resulting in people being injured.'

The autumn festival has special 
meaning in the county town where bonfire societies commemorate a 
two-year martyrdom known as the Marian Persecutions.

Under
 the reign of Edward VI, Mary Tudor fell under pressure to abandon her 
Catholic views, but was able to re-enforce them when she ascended to the
 throne in 1553.

The Queen infamously ordered the burning of 288 Protestants in turn, 17 of whom were killed in Lewes.

In
 an effort to remember their demise, residents of the small town 
dress-up as Protestant martyrs in black robes and bear crucifixes while 
carrying blazing torches through the streets.

Though
 most opt for Pagan dress, other costumes can be seen at the festival 
which also features a variety of effigies to be burned.

Pirates,
 priests and Romans are among the guises of choice at this evening's 
events where scores of local residents have braved the autumn chills to 
catch a glance at some of the most eye-catching outfits.

Earlier
 this week the town's council issues warnings to spectators, advising 
them to wear protective eye and ear equipment in anticipation of the 
event's large scale.

More than 80 people required treatment by ambulance crews at last year's celebration, with seven ending up in hospital.

The date has added meaning for Bonfire Societies Lewes, while for most it remembers the treason of Guy Fawkes who attempted to blow up the House of Lords in 1605

In
 2011, eight people required treatment at the Sussex Eye Hospital. Two 
were left blind, and three now have the risk of life-ling glaucoma.

The
 event's website announced road closures ahead of tonight's festivities,
 with traffic being diverted around the outside of the town as thousands
 march through its streets.

On-street parking is also suspended in parts of the town due the event, which costs £5 to attend.

For most the celebration relates to 
the events of the November 5, 1605, when Guy Fawkes among other traitors
 attempted to blow up the House of Lords during the State Opening of 
Parliament.

Fawkes, 
alongside 14 other Catholic men, hatched the plan in a bid to kill 
Protestant King James  inside the building by planting gunpowder beneath
 its foundations.

Fawkes
 was discovered in a cellar beneath Parliament and arrested by the 
king's guards. He was tried in court and subsequently executed after 
being found guilty of high treason.

Children
 in the Devonshire village of Ottery St Mary were also taking part in a different variety of festival which involves tossing a burning barrel between them while running through village streets.

Wearing protective gloves and neck gear, the children carried the barrel on their heads for short stints throughout the village before passing it on.

The tradition predates that of Guy Fawkes, with women, men and children as young as seven taking part in the past.

The festival, which pre-dates Guy Fawkes, finds itself under increasing pressure from health and safety organisations every year

Though fire engines are on hand to step in, participants are mainly left to their own devices

One of the event's organisers said visitors are often startled when they arrive at the festival, having expected to attend a fireworks display

Having attracted crowds as large as 20,000 in the past however, some spectators are a little startled by what they see.

Andy Wade of the Ottery Tar Barrels Festival Committee said: 'A lot of the complaints we get afterwards are from people who didn't know what to expect.

'People come expecting a firework display, and don't realise what they're coming to,' he told the Telegraph.
