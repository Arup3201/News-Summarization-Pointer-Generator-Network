Starbucks has been accused of unnecessarily hiking their prices in China by the country's state-controlled media.

In a seven-minute report aired by television channel CCTV, broadcasters claimed a tall latte in Beijing is more expensive than in London, Chicago and Mumbai.

But the worldwide coffee chain dismissed the damning report, saying you cannot compare different markets.

The story on Sunday gave the price of a Beijing latte as 27 yuan ($4.42), compared with 24.25 yuan ($3.97) in London, 19.98 yuan ($3.26) in Chicago and 14.6 yuan ($2.39) in Mumbai.

It follows a stream of attacks on the Seattle-based firm from China's state-run newspaper Economic Information Daily, accusing it of 'profiteering'.

The publication's latest article on the topic was headlined: 'Starbucks can't justify high prices in China.'

Analysts say the recent outcry is partly an official response to public frustration over high prices for imported goods.

But it is one of many attacks on overseas firms, that experts warn will raise alarm in the international business community.

Beijing - 27 yuan (£2.74)

London - 24.25 yuan (£2.46)

Chicago - 19.98 yuan (£2.03)

Mumbai - 14.6 yuan (£1.48)

Earlier this year, US tech giant Apple was accused of 'unparalleled arrogance' towards Chinese customers in a barrage of attacks earlier this year by state media.

The criticism stopped after Apple CEO Tim Cook apologised.

Foreign baby food manufacturers and pharmaceutical firms have also been targeted by authorities over allegations of price-fixing and corruption over the past year.

The media focus on Starbucks was because 'most probably Starbucks is the biggest and most famous' coffee chain in China, said Kevin Yeong, managing director of the Benchmark Asia Research Group.

'For the past few months, I've been very concerned about...any foreign-owned company, because it looks like the local government is trying to do something to restrict foreign companies,' he added.

In a statement, Starbucks said that its pricing in different cities is based on a variety of factors, including infrastructure investment, real estate, currency valuation and labour costs.

'Each Starbucks market is unique and has different operating costs, so it would be inaccurate to draw conclusions about one market based on the prices in a different market,' the company said.

'We continue to be humbled by the support we have received from our customers and the relevant authorities within the Chinese government,' it added.

But on its verified account on China's hugely popular microblogging site Sina Weibo, it posted a photo of a pencil with a toy horse on its end - a visual pun on a highly offensive Chinese obscenity.

Starbucks opened its doors in China in 1999 and now has more than 1,000 stores in the country and growing.

China is likely to overtake Canada as Starbucks' second-largest market after the US next year, and it is aiming to reach 1,500 stores by 2015, according to a spokeswoman.

Analysts said price differences could be explained not only by Starbucks' varied operating costs across the globe but also by the different role the coffee chain plays in the lives of Chinese consumers.

In the US, Starbucks gets much more of its revenue from takeaway sales.

But in China most business comes from customers who take their time inside the store, noted James Roy, a senior analyst with the Shanghai-based China Market Research Group.

Other cases: Apple CEO Tim Cook also had to answer to attacks from Chinese state-run media after being accused of poor customer treatment earlier this year. Pharmaceutical firms have also been targeted

'In China, it's a different positioning and a different value proposition,' he said. 'They invest more in making these stores themselves more premium options and making more of the environments as well.'

One new location opened in Beijing last month is a glistening two-storey, 24-hour store featuring live music at the weekend.

Yeong noted that while Starbucks' prices may be cheaper outside China, they are on a par with - and in some cases, cheaper than - those of its foreign competitors within China.

Some Internet users mocked the CCTV report.

'The price of housing, cars and gasoline, Internet service and taxes in China are all more expensive than in other countries,' argued one Sina Weibo user. 'Why can't Starbucks be more expensive, too?'
