A Turkish man who beat a New York City woman to death with a rock last year has been sentenced to life in prison by a Turkish court.

Ziya Tasali, 47, was additionally sentenced by the Istanbul court on Tuesday to eight years in prison for sexual assault and theft.

Sarai Sierra, a 33-year-old married mother to two sons, was found dead on February 2, 2013 amid Istanbul's ancient city walls, days after her family reported her missing in January during a solo trip to take photographs.

Authorities said Sierra was killed by a blow to the head.

Victim: Sarai Sierra, pictured, is seen at a NYC subway stop wearing the leather jacket she was wearing on the day she died-- which police say Ziya Tasali then sold at a nearby Bazaar

Tasali, a scrap-paper collector, has been on trial for Sierra's death since September.

Sierra travelled to Istanbul alone after her friend dropped out because of financial reasons.

Tasali admitted to killing Sierra in September during the trial but denied accusations that he had sexually assaulted her, the private Dogan news agency reported.

Tasali was arrested near the Syrian border in March, and had been on the run since Sierra's body was found and was believed to be in hiding in Syria.

During the trial, Tasali described himself as a scrap-paper collector with no fixed address.

He admitted fatally hitting Sierra with a rock but disputed charges of sexual assault.

'I was sitting beneath the walls. I had sniffed paint thinner (vapors) and was high,' Dogan quoted him as telling the court in Istanbul.

'I approached her and wanted to kiss her. But she hit me with her phone between my two eyebrows. I pushed her and she fell on the ground,' he said.

Tasali said Sierra fought him back and hit him in the face with a rock, which made him 'totally lose control.' He said he then struck Sierra with a rock.

Questioned about traces of his sperm found over the victim and some of her belongings, Tasali denied rape.

A defense lawyer said he did not believe his client was 'capable of grasping the meaning and results' of his actions. Judges hearing the case at the time ordered state forensic medical experts to place Tasali under observation and report back on his mental health, the news agency said.

Sierra's husband Steven, who went to Istanbul last year during the hunt for his wife's killer, spoke to the New York Times on Tuesday about Tasali's verdict.

'I don't hold any ill will towards him,' he said. 'I've always had an inner peace that I can't really explain apart from the Lord Jesus in my life.'

'I don't know what to believe, but it doesn't matter whether [Tasali] is lying or not,' Mr Sierra also said. 'The truth is that Sarai's life was taken and that is all that matters.'

Mr Sierra remarried this year, the New York Daily News reported.
