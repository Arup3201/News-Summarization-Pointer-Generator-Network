A California man has spoken of his shock after driving home from a car wash - only to find a stranger hidden in the trunk of his vehicle.

Sal Landeros had just pulled up to his house in Montclair, San Bernardino County, with his son, Chris, and brother, Eddie, when he heard a knocking from the rear of his car.

The trio approached the vehicle's trunk and slowly opened it, unsure of what they would find. But when they spotted a pair of eyes looking out at them, they immediately slammed it shut.

Video footage, captured by Eddie, shows the trunk opening to reveal a man lying down inside it. The stranger stares at the cops for several seconds, before climbing out of the trunk.

He is then handcuffed and taken into custody. It remains unknown why the unidentified man was in the car. He is believed to have entered the vehicle at Tuzos car wash in nearby Pomona.

In reference to the stranger, he added: 'He was saying sorry a lot and he was running away from someone that needed his money, because he didn't pay up or something.

'He must have got in [the car] while they were washing it. He just closed the trunk on himself.'
