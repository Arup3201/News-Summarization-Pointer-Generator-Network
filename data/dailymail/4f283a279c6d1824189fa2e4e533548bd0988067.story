Brendan Rodgers did his best to remain cool on a stressful night, showing little emotion when Ludogorets went in front and just holding an arm aloft when Liverpool equalised through Rickie Lambert.

His mask slipped, though, when Georgi Terziev scored late on make it 2-2 and he was captured on TV saying, ‘Oh ******* hell.’

 But the Liverpool boss couldn't keep his emotions under wraps as it see-sawed to a 2-2 finish 

Liverpool not alone in Sofia 

This may have been a ‘home’ game for Ludogorets but they did not enjoy unanimous backing in the Vasil Levski Stadium.

The match was played in Sofia, 200 miles from Ludogorets’ home stadium in Razgrad, and a number of locals came to add their support to the visitors. 

As one banner read: ‘We are Liverpool - Bulgaria. We Go Again.’

Lambert’s European dream 

Rickie Lambert completed his meteoric rise by scoring his first Champions League goal.

Four years ago this week Lambert and Southampton drew 0-0 at home with Brighton in League One.

Since then he has enjoyed two promotions with the Saints, a call up to England, a move to his boyhood club Liverpool and now a goal in Europe’s top competition.

Blast from the past 

Variety can be expected when a team goes travelling in Europe but not for Liverpool where Bulgaria is concerned. 

This was their fifth visit to this part of the Eastern bloc but they have never played anywhere different to the Vasil Levski Stadium, an arena that epitomises games from another era - a vast bowl, with a running track and huge, glowing floodlights.

Kolo celebrates a near miss 

Kolo Toure could never be accused of hiding his emotions, often looking distraught after calamitous mistakes. 

The Ivorian almost conceded an own goal and bewilderingly decided to mark the moment by exchanging high-fives with the error-prone Simon Mignolet. 

To be fair, he deserved his chance after his fine display against Real Madrid.
