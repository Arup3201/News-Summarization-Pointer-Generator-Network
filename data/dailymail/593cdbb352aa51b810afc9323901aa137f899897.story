Former world heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson has given his side of the story about his tumultuous relationship with former wife actress Robin Givens.

In a new, no-holds-barred memoir, 'Undisputed Truth', Tyson writes that Givens and her mother had been 'on the prowl for a big black celebrity for Robin,' and Tyson, at the height of his fame in 1987, fit the bill.

Despite having already dated some of the world's most beautiful women including Naomi Campbell, Tyson had chronically low self-esteem.

'My social skills consisted of putting a guy in a coma,' he writes. 'So maybe Robin was just what the doctor ordered.'

Givens, a Sarah Lawrence graduate who was starring on the ABC sitcom 'Head of the Class', was well-spoken, educated and beautiful.

Just 11 months after their first date, to which Givens arrived with her mother and publicist, the pair were married. He was 22 years old.

According to Tyson, their wedding was hastily arranged because Givens, then 24, had announced that she was pregnant.

Tyson writes that Givens' mother Ruth, who he referred to as 'Ruthless,' immediately set about finding the pair a suitable mansion to settle into, at Tyson's expense.

During a close friend's funeral, Tyson received a phone call from his accountant, who told him Givens and her mother were in his office, demanding that he release $5 million so that they could purchase a New Jersey estate.

Against his accountant's advice, he gave the money, and another $10 million soon after, which he placed into a separate account for Givens and her mother.

It was at about this time, writes Tyson, that Givens, whose slender frame hadn't grown in the months since she'd become pregnant, told Tyson that she had miscarried their baby.

'She was supposedly three months pregnant when we got married,' he writes.

The pair married on February 7, 1988.

'Now it was June and she hadnâ€™t gained a pound, so the next thing I knew she was in bed and claimed she had miscarried our baby.'

That same year, Tyson and Givens gave an interview to Barbara Walters. Tyson says the interview was originally meant to be a profile on him, but Givens had pulled Walters aside and told her 'that she still didn't have the truth.'

Walters, whose journalistic interest must have been piqued, asked Givens to join her husband for the interview.

It would go down in history as one of the most uncomfortable celebrity interviews of all time.

Givens began by listing Tyson's qualities, but quickly moved on to his deficits.

He had an 'extremely volatile temper,' Givens told Walters as Tyson looks down, somewhere beyond the camera, his eyes wide with disbelief. 

'He's got a side to him that's scary,' she went on. 'Michael is intimidating, to say the least. I think there's a time when he cannot control his temper. And that's frightening to me. To my mother. To anyone around.'

'Does he hit you?' Walters asked, neither woman looking at nor speaking to Tyson who continued to stare at the floor.

'He shakes, he pushes, he swings,' responded Givens.

'Just recently I have become afraid. I mean very, very much afraid.'

Givens filed for divorce soon after the interview, but Tyson says they continued to see each other.

Tyson describes how one day he encountered a pre-fame Brad Pitt at Givens' house.

'Dude, don't strike me,' said Pitt, 'don't strike me.'

'You had to see the look on his face,' Tyson writes. 'He looked like he was ready to receive his last rites. He also looked stoned out of his gourd.'

Tyson and Givens' divorce was finalized on Valentine's Day 1989. They had never signed a prenuptial agreement and she received a reported settlement of more than $10 million.

Following the divorce, Givens received bad press and one article described her as the 'most hated woman in America.'

The pair have maintained a war of words through the media ever since.
