The steep rise in the number of 'ultra-rich' people living in San Francisco  this year, has seen the city push ahead of Los Angeles to become California's hub for multi-millionaires.

According to a report on 'America's Ultra-Wealthy Population', the number of individuals in San Francisco worth $30million or more jumped by 12 per cent to 5,460 in 2014.

In Los Angles, the figure climbed by a relatively modest four per cent from 4,945  to 5,135 ultra-high net worth individuals, leaving the city lagging slightly behind its northern neighbor.

But although California led the nation as the state with the most ultra-rich residents, neither of its metropolises could beat New York City as a hub for super-rich individuals.

With 8,655 ultra-wealthy residents - up eight per cent from a year earlier - New York City was found to be the preferred home for high net worth individuals not just in America but across the world.

Although no reason was given for San Francisco to overtake Los Angeles in terms of wealthy residents, it seems the city's booming tech industry - which appears to be turning the city into a playground for the wealthy - may hold the key.

The survey by Wealth X, working with the Swiss bank UBS, also noted that the number of ultra-rich in the United States climbed 7.6 per cent to 34,789 in the past year, with their collective wealth increasing 7.3 per cent.

In Los Angles - previously California's hub of multimillionaires - the number of ultra-high net worth individuals climbed by a relatively modest four per cent from 4,945 to 5,135 in 2014

Florida's ultra-high net worth population grew by more than 10 per cent over the past year, due to strong growth in the state's financial and real estate sectors. It now has an extra 500 individuals with a net worth of $30million or more.

Michigan also put on a good show in 2014, adding close to 200 new ultra-high net worth individuals to its population, thanks to rising confidence in the state’s economic outlook.

But the state with the fastest growing ultra-high net worth population was North Dakota, which saw the number of uber-rich residents jumping by 14.3 per cent.
