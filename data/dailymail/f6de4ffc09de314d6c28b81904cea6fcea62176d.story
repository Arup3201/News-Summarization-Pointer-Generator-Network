England may have claimed the bragging rights in Tuesday night's friendly at Celtic Park but the seniors are by no means the only Three Lions side taking on Scotland this week.

The Under 16s face the Auld Enemy on Thursday evening in their final Sky Sports Victory Shield contest of the season - and they have a chance of lifting the trophy at Yeovil's Huish Park.

So far, Steve Cooper's young charges have lost 1-0 to Wales in Bangor and beaten Northern Ireland 1-0 thanks to a goal from Ipswich Town midfielder Andre Dozzell.

Those results have left them third in the standings ahead of the final round but a win, coupled with a favourable result in the Northern Ireland vs Wales match, will deliver England the trophy for the 36th time since its inception in 1946.

However, the greatest concern for coach Cooper is to give his schoolboy team valuable exposure to international football and put on an entertaining display for what is expected to be a large crowd in Somerset.

He said: 'The players were really looking forward to meeting up for this game and relationships have already started to form which is great.

'Development is about individual talent but it is also about playing in a team. To do that we need to make sure the players bond - and they certainly are.

'We are working with 16-year-olds who are on the start of an international journey and we need to be mindful of that.

'Our expectations need to be high but they need to be appropriate. We need to concentrate on the now but have an eye on the future as well.'

With that in mind, Cooper has recalled many of the squad members for the Wales and Northern Ireland matches, but there are first call-ups for Manchester City defender Diego Lattie and Arsenal forward Reiss Nelson.

Followers of youth football will notice some familiar surnames in the squad, including Trevoh Chalobah of Chelsea, the brother of Nathaniel, who is currently out on loan at Burnley.

Joe Willock, who plays for Arsenal, is the younger brother of Chris Willock, also on the Gunners' books.

It certainly won't have escaped the notice of these 15 and 16-year-olds that England captain Wayne Rooney earned his 100th international cap in the Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia at the weekend.

But it will also be of great encouragement that Rooney was once like them, playing for England in the 2001 Victory Shield campaign and he netted his first goal in a Three Lions shirt - the first of many to come.

Rooney stands alongside the likes of Bobby Charlton, Peter Shilton, Duncan Edwards, Michael Owen and Trevor Brooking as England players who have benefited from a footballing education in this competition.

Manchester United star Rooney recalled: 'The first game we played was against Wales. I was on the bench and came on as a sub. I was disappointed because I wanted to start, I wanted to play up front, and I always remember the coach saying that I wasn’t a centre-forward – he said I was a winger. The next game he played me as centre-forward from the start and I scored against Scotland. That was a nice moment.

'I was a young lad, 15, the game was on television and was something different to what I’d been used to. All my family and friends were watching the game, so it was a big moment. Once I’d tasted that, being on TV playing football and everyone seeing what I could do, I just wanted more of it.'

Both of Thursday night's Victory Shield matches are being screened live on Sky Sports 5, with Northern Ireland vs Wales starting at 6pm and England vs Scotland at 8pm.
