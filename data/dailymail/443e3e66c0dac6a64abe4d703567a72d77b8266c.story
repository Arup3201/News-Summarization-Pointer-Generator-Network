Men are more likely to boast about their accomplishments, according to research that will come as no surprise to many women.

They are also more likely to lie to cover up their deficiencies, a new study has found.

Approximately seven in 10 men confessed to boasting about what they are good at, while half admitted they have claimed to be skilled in areas that they are not.

The survey suggests that men’s reliance on bragging comes from a greater need to boost their own confidence and one in 10 men said they do it in a bid to win the respect of others.

Psychologist Professor Cary Cooper, of Lancaster University, said men are conditioned to be more competitive than women and feel a greater need to impress.

‘The reason for men being more boastful than women stems from traditional male and female roles,’ he said.

‘In the past, men were more likely to be the main breadwinners, with a need to boast to achieve success within the competitive male dominated workplace.

‘Outside the workplace, boasting may be used by men for impressing members of the opposite sex.’

Almost half of men surveyed by thetrainline.com confessed to bragging in order to boost their confidence and 42 per cent said they have lied about their abilities to make themselves look good.

In contrast, the survey found that just 37 per cent of women have misled others about their talents, while 54 per cent said they have blown their own trumpet.

The study found that people are more likely to show off when they are younger.

Over half of 18-24 year-olds exaggerate their skills, compared to a quarter of over 55's.

The research found that men in particular struggle to admit to things they are bad at, but recognising failings is an endearing quality to others, experts said.

When others confess their weaknesses, 67 per cent of people appreciate their honesty, 41 per cent have more respect for them and 15 per cent like them more.

Confirming that a great British stereotype is true – that Britons are humble and depreciating, – most people believe themselves to be rubbish at eight things and only good at five.

It appears that Britons' main shortcomings as a nation are singing and dancing, with other half of respondents to the story admitting they have no talent in these areas.

Around two in five people say they are good at saving money and 22 per cent at planning efficient travel routes.

However, it might be fair to assume that women are better at planning day trips, as men are 27 per cent more likely to miss a train than women and 19 per cent more inclined to jump on the wrong one. They are also more likely to lose luggage and tickets.
