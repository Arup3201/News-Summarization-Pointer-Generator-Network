As well as their near-identical hats, both selected Kurt Geiger stilettos.

As they entered via the Great West Door to greet members of the congregation including the Archbishop of Canterbury, applause and cheers from the crowds were sounded.

The nation will celebrate the Diamond 
Jubilee at a service of thanksgiving today, but missing from the Queen's
 side will be the Duke of Edinburgh.

Philip is being treated in hospital for a bladder infection and will not be part of a series of events today, planned to mark the Queen's 60-year milestone.The Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, will give the sermon at the St Paul's Cathedral thanksgiving service and is expected to pay tribute to the Queen.

Prime Minister David Cameron will lead the large representation from the coalition Government and other figures will include governor generals, diplomats and foreign leaders.

After the 10.30am service, conducted by the Dean of St Paul’s, The Very Reverend Dr David Ison, the Queen will attend a reception at Mansion House while other senior royals including Charles and Camilla will attend a similar event at the Guildhall. At both events will be members of the thanksgiving congregation.

The Queen and her family will then attend a City of London Livery companies lunch at Westminster Hall - The Livery Companies of the City of 
London originated in medieval times as Guilds responsible for trade 
regulation, including checking the quality of goods, weights and 
measures and training.

Today the companies use their funds to undertake charitable and community work.

Some 700 guests representing the 
companies’ abundant trades and professions, ranging from grocers and 
gunmakers to fruiterers and fishmongers, will join for the 
tribute.

Prince William will be placed at the Engineers and Arbitrators table, while Kate will be joined by the Master Glovers and Pattenmakers.

The Worshipful Company of Pattenmakers
 was founded in the 17th century as a trade association for the makers 
of pattens - under-shoes of wood and metal which were worn strapped 
beneath the shoes to raise the wearer out of the mud on the streets.

The Company now draws its membership 
from the City of London and the Footwear industry, with its main focus 
being charitable works. The Worshipful Company of Glovers was formed in 1349 by glove makers in London to protect their craft.

Harry will be on the Fruiterers and Gardeners table. Among the vast range of participating 
Livery companies are the Worshipful Companies of Goldsmiths, Butchers, 
Innholders, Weavers, Distillers, Clockmakers and even Tax Advisers.

Guests will dine on marinated Uist 
Island salmon with Lyme Bay crab, followed by saddle of Welsh Cambrian 
Mountain lamb with braised shoulder of lamb, grilled Isle of Wight 
asparagus, Jersey Royal potatoes and an aptly named Jubilee sauce.

The 'symphony of dessert' is chocolate delice, bread and butter pudding and berry compote with Sandringham apple sauce

A Ceylon tea will also be served made 
from a bush planted by the Duke of Edinburgh during a state visit to Sri
 Lanka in 1954 in the Pedro Tea Plantation in Nuwara Eliya.

The National Children’s Orchestra of Great Britain will perform during the event while the House of Commons’ speaker John 
Bercow will say grace and the loyal toast will be proposed by the Lord 
Speaker Baroness D’Souza.

The highlight of the day will be a glittering carriage procession through the streets of Whitehall before the Queen and her family gather on Buckingham Palace's balcony to watch a flypast of Second World War aircraft and the Red Arrows.

The Prince of Wales paid a heartfelt tribute to his mother last night, following the Diamond Jubilee concert staged near Buckingham Palace.

Stood on stage with the Queen a few feet away, Charles told hundreds of thousands who had gathered to watch the star-studded event that they were 'celebrating the life and service of a very special person'.

But he added there was a disappointing element to the night.

'The only sad thing about this evening is that my father cannot be her with us because unfortunately he's taken unwell," he said.The Prince went on to say: 'And we're now celebrating the life and service of a very special person, over the last 60 years. I was three when my grandfather George VI died and suddenly, unexpectedly you and my father's lives were irrevocably changed when you were only 26.

'So as a nation this is our opportunity to thank you and my father for always being there for us. For inspiring us with your selfless duty and service and for making us proud to be British.'

Celebrities attending the concert included Brian May, who famously played the national anthem on the palace's roof during the 2002 Golden Jubilee concert, television presenters Floella Benjamin and Kirstie Allsopp, and ex-Bond Girl Barbara Bach who is married to former Beatle Ringo Starr.

Many of the hosts, who included Lenny Henry and Jimmy Carr, poked fun at the royals.

But Rob Brydon got one of the biggest laughs from the crowds when he said: 'Sixty years of reign. Sounds like a Welsh summer.'

Kylie Minogue arrived on stage dressed as a Pearly Queen, wearing a romper-style black shorts suit adorned with mother of pearl buttons. She completed the look with a black jacket that had a crown design in buttons on the back, and a peak cap.

Sir Elton John's Crocodile Rock was one of the biggest tunes of the night, with William, Harry and Beatrice singing and dancing in their seats to the 70s tune.

The palace was transformed into a row of terraced houses, via a projection, for Madness' performance from the historic building's roof.

Lead singer Suggs ended the tune Our House by changing one of the lines of the lyric and saying in a posh accent, 'In the middle of one's street'.The royals stood for the final act, Sir Paul McCartney, who ran through a string of Beatles songs including Magical Mystery Tour, All My Loving and Let It Be.

After Charles' speech there was a huge fireworks display fired from the roof of the palace.
