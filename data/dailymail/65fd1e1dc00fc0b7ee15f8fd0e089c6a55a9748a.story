A federal appeals court today overturned a controversial ruling ordering Massachusetts prison officials to provide taxpayer-funded sex-reassignment surgery for an inmate convicted of murder.

Michelle Kosilek, born Robert Kosilek, has already received hormone treatments, psychotherapy and electrolysis while serving a life sentence for strangling to death her wife, Cheryl, in 1990.

But she has continued to wage a protracted legal battle for the $20,000 full genital reconstruction treatment she says is necessary to relieve the mental anguish caused by gender-identity disorder.

While imprisoned, she has tried to commit suicide twice, as well as attempting to castrate herself.

Convicted murderer: A federal appeals court has overturned a ruling ordering Massachusetts prison officials to provide taxpayer-funded sex-reassignment surgery for convicted murderer Michelle Kosilek (pictured)

In 2012, U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf judge became the first judge in the country to order sex-reassignment surgery as a remedy for an inmate's gender-identity disorder.

Although most American courts agree that prisons must evaluate transgender inmates to determine their medical needs, most have ordered only hormone treatments and psychotherapy, not surgery.

In January, Wolf's decision was upheld by a three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. However, prison officials appealed and won a rehearing before the full appeals court.

Now, in a 3-2 ruling, the full 1st Circuit found that Kosilek failed to demonstrate officials violated the Eight Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment by not providing the surgery.

The court noted that the state's Department of Correction has already provided treatment for 65-year-old Kosilek's gender-identity disorder, including the female hormones and laser hair removal.

The court also acknowledged the department's concerns about protecting Kosilek from sexual assaults if she completes her gender transition.

She is currently housed in a male prison but hoped to be transferred to a female prison after the surgery.

'After carefully considering the community standard of medical care, the adequacy of the provided treatment, and the valid security concerns articulated by the DOC, we conclude that the district court erred and that the care provided to Kosilek by the DOC does not violate the Eighth Amendment,' Judge Juan Torruella wrote for the majority. 

However, two judges disagreed with the verdict.

In a sharply worded dissenting opinion, Judge Ojetta Rogeriee Thompson suggested that Kosilek would not have had to fight a long battle for constitutionally adequate medical care if she was not seeking 'a treatment that many see as strange or immoral'.

'Prejudice and fear of the unfamiliar have undoubtedly played a role in this matter's protraction,' Thompson wrote. The Department of Correction declined to comment immediately.

The case sparked a heated debate in Massachusetts, where Kosilek's lawsuit became fodder for radio talk shows and state lawmakers who say the state should not be forced to pay for or provide a murderer's sex-reassignment surgery.

In his ruling ordering the surgery, U.S. District Court Judge Mark Wolf found that it is the 'only adequate treatment' for Kosilek.

In 2011, the inmate told The Associated Press  that the surgery is a medical necessity.

'Everybody has the right to have their health care needs met, whether they are in prison or out on the streets,' Kosilek said.

'People in the prisons who have bad hearts, hips or knees have surgery to repair those things. My medical needs are no less important or more important than the person in the cell next to me.'

Kosilek's lawyer, Joseph Sulman, said he was disappointed in the ruling, but declined further comment because he had not yet read the full 117-page ruling.

Jennifer Levi, director of the Transgender Rights Project of the Boston-based legal group Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders, said she was appalled by the ruling.

'If somebody had a heart condition, if somebody had liver disease, if somebody had diabetes ... under the constitutional principles applied to all people who are incarcerated, that person would be entitled to essential medical care,' Levi said.

'It really is hard to understand this decision as anything other than transgender exceptionalism.'
