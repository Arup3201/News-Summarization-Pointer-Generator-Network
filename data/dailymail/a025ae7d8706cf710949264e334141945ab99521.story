Cruzeiro's Lucas Silva has admitted it would be a 'dream come true' to join Real Madrid after revealing the European champions have enquired about him.

The 21-year-old midfielder said the Spanish side have yet to make a bid but have been in contact with his agent over a possible move in the next few months.

Silva told SPorTV: 'I don't know if they are going to propose me joining them midway through or at the end of the season, whether I'll stick around for the Copa Libertadores or not.

'I don't know yet what's going to happen. However, it'd be interesting to stay for the Libertadores and then join them for pre-season.'

He added: 'It would be a dream come true.'

Silva, who played for Brazil's Under 20 team in the Toulon Tournament this year, was named the Brazilian League's player of the season after Cruzeiro were crowned champions for the second consecutive season.

His desire to stay for the Copa Libertadores, the South American equivalent of the Champions League, comes after Cruzeiro were knocked out by eventual winners San Lorenzo of Argentina at the quarter-final stage.
