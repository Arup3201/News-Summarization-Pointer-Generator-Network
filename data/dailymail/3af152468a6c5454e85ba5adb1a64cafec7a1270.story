Norman Foster has expressed his 'sadness' after his firm's controversial $350 million revamp of the New York Public Library was scrapped.

The celebrated architect's company 
Foster + Partners had been enlisted to redesign the Library's 
century-old Beaux-Arts research building on Manhatten's Fifth Avenue.

The plan had drawn widespread opposition from scholars and was the target of four lawsuits.

One critic labelled the Foster design as having 'all the elegance and distinction of a suburban mall'.

The New York Public Library has abandoned its $300 million plan to revamp its flagship midtown Manhattan building and move 1.5 million books to New Jersey

New York's new mayor Bill de Blasio also campaigned against the renovations during last year's municipal elections.

And only last week hundreds of protesters gathered outside 
the building during a meeting of trustees. But the most obvious reason 
for the U-turn is the project's increasing price tag.

Foster + Partners declined to 
comment, but Lord Foster told The New York Times: 'Obviously, I respect 
the decision of the trustees and whoever's been involved in the 
decision.

'If I have any 
kind of sadness on the thing – besides obviously not having the project 
going ahead and having spent a huge amount of passion on the project 
with colleagues – it is that the proposals have never been revealed, and
 there hasn't really been a debate by those involved, including those 
who would have benefited from an inclusive approach to the library.'

The plan involved closing and selling two midtown branch libraries.

Their functions would have been consolidated inside the main research library at 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue, which would have become a circulating library.

The New York Times, which first reported the library's about-face, said probable cost overruns were one factor in the decision.

It said a study showed the project's cost would have been significantly more than the $300 million originally budgeted.

The renovation would have involved moving 1.5 million books from stacks in the Fifth Avenue building to storage in New Jersey.

Scholars complained that moving so many books would have created hardships for researchers.

The revised plan still will involve renovating the research library, formally known as the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building, while keeping the stacks intact.

The renovation was to have been partly financed with $150 million from the city budget. That money still will go to the library but now will be used for other purposes.
