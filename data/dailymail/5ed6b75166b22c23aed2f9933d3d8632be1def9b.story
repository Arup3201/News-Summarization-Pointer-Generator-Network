The NHS is spending more than £2million a day on medication for diabetes, its own figures show.

Costs have soared 50 per cent in eight years as obesity and unhealthy lifestyles lead to more of the illness, particularly type 2 diabetes.

The latest report from the Health and Social Care Information Centre shows that 123,000 prescriptions for diabetes are handed out every day in England – some 45 million a year. This is up from 27.1million in 2005/6 when data was first collected.

The NHS spends £10billion caring for patients with diabetes, which is 10 per cent of its entire annual budget

The NHS now spends £803million a year on treatments such as insulin and pills to control blood sugar – a tenth of its entire drugs bill – compared to £514million eight years ago.

But this doesn’t include the far greater costs of the illness incurred by hospital stays, amputations and treatments for kidney failure, heart disease and strokes caused by diabetes.

Overall, the NHS spends £10billion caring for patients with diabetes, which is 10 per cent of its entire annual budget.

Simon O’Neill, of the Diabetes UK charity, said: ‘The dramatic increase in cases of type 2 diabetes which we have seen in current years is a huge factor in this spending.

‘If the Government wants to reduce this enormous cost, we need to see it intervening to ensure that the rise of cases is stemmed.’

Around 2.7million Britons have been diagnosed with the disease and 90 per cent have type 2 diabetes, which is linked to obesity.

The Department of Health said that it was putting more money and effort into preventing diabetes, and that 1.3million people had taken up a free NHS health check last year.
