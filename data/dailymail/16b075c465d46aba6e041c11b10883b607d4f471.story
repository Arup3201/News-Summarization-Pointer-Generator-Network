After sampling some of the fine wines on offer at this hotel, you may feel like your head is spinning when you return to your room.

But the reality may well be that the room is, quite literally, spinning.

The Design & Wine Hotel in the northern seaside resort of Caminha, in Portugal, has five suites raised on a platform that is connected to a rotating 18-ton pillar. 

Five suites at the Design & Wine Hotel in Caminha, Portugal, are raised by a giant pillar and rotated twice daily by 35 degrees

The rotating bedroom suites offer guests the chance of different views from their window during their stay at the Portuguese hotel

The bedrooms at the rotating Portuguese hotel are luxurious in decor, reflecting traditions of the local area

The idea is that guests can fall asleep facing the Santa Tecla mountains, and when they wake they will be treated to a Minho River view. 

But don't worry - the rooms only move 35 degrees twice a day, so you're unlikely to get any motion sickness. And all for only £67 a night.

The innovative design was the brainchild of Pedro Guimarães, who sought to bring a fresh new feel to the luxury hotel business.

There are 23 rooms in total, all except the five suites are housed in an 18th century building that oozes history and tradition.

This open space is where guests get the chance to sample some of the fine wines on offer, and maybe their heads will be spinning before they even return to their rooms!

Each bedroom is designed differently, but each has a unique style that will be hard to find at any other resort in the world

The food in the restaurant is locally sourced, and celebrates everything that is unique about Portuguese cuisine

The four-star hotel prides itself on an eco policy. The property is powered by solar panels and automatic lighting in each room conserves energy.

Guests are also encouraged to recycle.

Local culture and tradition is demonstrated in the decor throughout as well as the food and wine servings in the restaurant.

On going to sleep the guests can have a marvellous mountain view, when they wake they will be greeted by a river

The rotating suites are spacious in the extreme, offering guests the chance to get the best view possible as they spin on the pillar

The 'enoteca' is where you might like to spend most of your 'down time.'

This is a bright and airy space where guests can taste wines of all Portuguese regions, including Douro region reds and Alvarinho and Loureiro verdes. 

After this taste-sensation experience you can take home the ones you liked most.

We've all heard of counting sheep to help you sleep, well this room offers the perfect opportunity to count 'arrows' to help you nod off

Guests can also choose from a great variety of outdoor activities, such as cycling, fishing, diving and hiking. 

The Igreja Matriz (main church) and the Clock Tower are at a two minute walk. The Hotel is situated 26 miles from Vigo-Peinador Airport and 55 milesfrom Oporto- Francisco Sá Carneiro Airport.
