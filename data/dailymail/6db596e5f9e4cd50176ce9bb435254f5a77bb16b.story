Banned: Redshaw will no longer be allowed to teach after a number of 'inappropriate' emails to a 13-year-old pupil came to light

A teacher called a 13-year old pupil the 'fittest babe in the school' as he bombarded her with a succession of inappropriate messages.

Daniel Redshaw, 33, even used his wife's laptop to email the girl,  a disciplinary panel heard yesterday.

Redshaw, who taught at St Guthlac School, in Crowland, Lincolnshire, sent the girl a number of emails under a false name, using phrases 
such as 'the hottest', 'well good looking' and 'pretty plz let me 
have her number', the panel was told.

He has now been struck off the teaching register indefinitely.

The school was made aware of Redshaw's pursuit when parents of the student's friend convinced her to tell the school, after she had initially confided in their daughter.

Redshaw, who was dismissed from the school in 2009, was found guilty by the General Teaching Council's Professional Conduct Committee of 'unacceptable professional conduct' while employed as head of maths at St Guthlac School.

The panel struck him off the teaching register. It means he cannot seek to return to the classroom for at least seven years.

The panel findings say that Redshaw 'behaved in an inappropriate and unprofessional manner to a 13 year old student (identified only as Student A)' by sending her emails using the name of 'Bob Smythe' and approached and intimidated her at school.

It said that, on or around October 7, 2008, he kept her behind in class and said 'we spent so many hours together yesterday at the open evening, it was nice we should do it again.' 

On or around October 8, 2008, he asked her if she had looked at her emails and told her that he had sent emails to her under the name 'Bob Smythe'. 

Then, on or around October 10, 2008, he said to her: 'I guess I must try harder', and again asked if she had read his emails.

He again asked her about them on or around October 21, 2008, and told her that she should come up to him if she felt bored in English class because he wanted to see her.

The panel also found that he 'made inappropriate use of school computer equipment' by using it to obtain the girl's email address and send some of the emails to her.

Committee chairwoman Rosalind Burford said the committee had seen printouts of the emails which were sent to the girl including one from Redshaw's wife's laptop.

She said: 'The content of the emails is clearly inappropriate, particularly phrases such as 'will the hottest, well good looking [Student A] pretty plz let me have her number...' and '[Student A] - the fittest (!!!) babe at school'.

Finding his conduct unacceptable, she said his behaviour had seriously affected Student A and that he had not provided any evidence of insight into his failings or expression of regret. 

She said: 'We have concluded that Mr Redshaw's behaviour is incompatible with being a registered teacher.'

Afterwards, Steve Baragwanath, executive head of the Holbeach and Crowland Secondary Federation, which includes St Guthlac School, said: 'I'm glad this has been resolved. It brings closure for the family and the youngster involved.'

He said the matter had initially been reported by the girl's parents. The matter was dealt with by the school as quickly and as fully as possible.

There was an internal investigation and Redshaw was dismissed. The information was then passed to the GTC.

'Our concern was that something like this could happen at another place and we wanted to make sure that the matter was resolved properly.

'There was an internal review of the school's policies and procedures but it was not felt necessary to make any changes.'
