Max Clifford’s wife Jo is filing for  a quickie divorce at the High Court today.

She was granted a hearing within three weeks of the  disgraced PR guru being jailed for sexually abusing young girls.

Mrs Clifford, 51, who did not attend his trial and was not called as a character witness, was seen without her wedding ring as he awaited a verdict last month.

Irish-born Jo, who worked as his PA before they married four years ago, has hired £450-an-hour celebrity lawyer Raymond Tooth.

Mr Tooth, whose reputation has earned him the nickname Jaws, confirmed: ‘They are divorcing. There are no disputed matters.

‘Everything has been sorted out amicably so it’s all done.’

his court case. The 71-year-old took out a £3.5million loan on his 
London mansion in the run-up to his trial.

 Clifford’s lawyer, whose motto is ‘Don’t get even – get Tooth’, has 
represented Irina Abramovich, 46, former wife of Chelsea Football Club

star Eric Clapton’s ex, Pattie Boyd, 70.
