For years, our continental neighbours have been applauded as chic, slim and poised - all achieved seemingly without effort.

Even more infuriatingly, French women appear to be able to maintain their slender elegance through everything from pregnancy to old age.

But according to one Parisienne, getting the Gallic look isn't as effortless as it appears, with pressure to be thin causing some women to resort to extreme measures in a bid to remain slim.

What's her secret? Actress Charlotte Gainsbourg defines the glamorised perception of the French woman

Speaking to the BBC, 50-year-old Isabelle said: 'If you are fat, you will not get that job. But if you have the silhouette - chic, ultra-slim, elegant - you are more or less made.'

The Parisian art gallery director, who confesses that she's far from slim, says she enjoys being the exception to the rule - but maintains that she can only get away with it because she is self-employed.

She explains that being 'fat' makes her feel free but reveals she struggles to find clothes to fit her in French shops.

So how do the rest of the population do it? According to journalist Peggy Frey, it's all down to an intense, if hidden, regime.

Writing in Le Figaro, Frey
revealed that French women would 'rather die than reveal their 
beauty secrets'.

She also alleged that they scour hairdressers for the best colourist to give them a 'natural' looking hue, and invest in super strong anti-wrinkle creams from the tender age of 25.

She added: 'They may never talk 
about dieting, but that doesn't mean they don't watch what they eat.

'After all, you can't gorge on buttered baguettes all day and magically 
maintain a size eight figure', and revealed that almost half smoke cigarettes, known to suppress the appetite, in a bid to stay slim.

It has even been said, according to BBC reports, that the average French women feels the need to lose at least 2kg (4.4lbs) to fit in.

Cashing in on this is the French slimming industry, which is booming with diet pills packed onto pharmacy shelves and slimming tips filling the pages of glossy magazines.

And it has had a chilling impact on the psyche of French women, with Sonia Feertchak, editor-in-chief of 
L'Encyclo des Filles, a popular guide to health and beauty for teenage 
girls, concluding that French women 'daren't' grow fat.

'Some will even starve themselves because in this society to be a fat female is to be a failure,' she explained.

'Fat women are seen as stupid. Their lives must be out-of-control, they are judged ugly, weird losers.'

Sophia Thomas, a 25-year-old Briton who spent four years studying in France, added: 'Everywhere you look in Paris, there are beautiful, slim women.

'Whether it is on fashion billboards or just across the street, you can't escape that supposed perfection.

'Everybody aspires to be some sort of Coco Chanel. She was the epitome of high octane glamour with that perfect rouge pout, peachy cheeks, Breton stripes and flowing pearls.

'It's tough, especially when there are boulangeries on every corner. However, it seems that it's going to take years to shake off that glamourised view of French women, so I guess I'll be passing on that croissant and hot chocolate!'

FRENCH WOMEN DON'T GET FAT

The
 grandmaman of the 'learn from the French' genre, this purports to unlock 
the key to how, despite eating mounds of cheese and foie gras, French 
women retain their figures. Author Mireille Guiliano claims that while 
they don’t forbid themselves anything, they eat it in moderation. Rather
 than obsessing about diets, they take pleasure in staying slim while 
eating well.

WHAT FRENCH WOMEN KNOW

...is
 the importance of understanding 'the brevity of time and the immediacy 
of pleasure', writes Debra Ollivier. In other words, they’re more 
pragmatic than the rest of us.

CHIC AND SLIM

Never mind diet, it’s underwear that’s 
are key to French women’s figures, according to Anne Barone. 'Even 
French women’s lingerie helps to keep them slim,' Barone explains. ‘It’s a
constant reminder to make choices that pay off in slimness. Their 
belief in this principle is demonstrated by the fact that there are 
almost as many lingerie shops in Paris as bakeries.’

FRENCH CHILDREN DON'T THROW FOOD

French mothers 'seemed to adhere to different rules' to their English counterparts. Pamela Druckerman decided to investigate and, after interviewing dozens of French mothers, sociologists and doctors, wrote a fascinating book

FRENCH WOMEN DON'T SLEEP ALONE

Aside
 from an inbuilt knowledge of how to tie a Hermes scarf, French women 
never seem to have any problem finding a boyfriend. Yet, according to 
author Jamie Cat Callan, they don’t go on dates — instead the secret to 
finding love French-style is to adopt a ‘coterie’ of fabulous friends 
through whom you are introduced to men in a relaxed social context. Of 
course, it also helps if you’re slim and fabulous.
