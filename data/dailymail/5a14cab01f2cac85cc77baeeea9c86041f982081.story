France's focus has shifted and they are determined to return home from Brazil with the World Cup in their hands according to Bacary Sagna and Morgan Schneiderlin.

Les Bleus travelled to South America unwilling to look further than progressing from the group stages but following their early success they have their sights set on World Cup glory.

After failing to win a match during the disastrous 2010 World Cup campaign in South Africa and struggling during qualification for Brazil, the free-scoring French finally believe they have their confidence back.

Change: Free-scoring France have altered their targets from group stage progression to World Cup glory

Sagna, who completed his free transfer to Manchester City from Arsenal earlier this month, said that France will look to progress 'step by step' in the tournament and that losing to Nigeria in the last 16 would be 'a failure'.

The 31-year-old right back, quoted in L'Equipe, added: 'As players, we aspire to go as far as possible, to win the trophy.

'The World Cup will be successful only if we go to the end.

'If we do not do it then it would be a failure.

'The goal has been refined over time - it is four matches to the title and we want to do it.'

France found goals easy to come by in their first two Group E matches, beating Honduras 3-0 and Switzerland 5-2, before confirming their place as groupwinners after a 0-0 draw with Ecuador.

And Southampton midfielder Schneiderlin believes they need to keep playing in the same way to progress.

He said: 'For us, the goal is to win the World Cup otherwise it is useless to participate - but without putting unnecessary pressure on ourselves.

Attack: Schneiderlin (right) says the squad must 'build on the exciting game' they used during the group

'We will see upcoming deadlines, but the the players and staff, we say that there is something beautiful to do.

'We must build on the exciting game used during the group phases.'

When reminded that he is likely to be a substitute for the match in Brasilia on Monday, Schneiderlin was quick to outline the importance of a squad in the World Cup.

The 24-year-old said: 'I am one among the twenty-three.

'Of course I want to play, but I'm here to take the France team forward - whether I start or am on the bench.

'You cannot play twenty-three players.'
