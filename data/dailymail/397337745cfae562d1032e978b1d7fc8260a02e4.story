Detective Sgt. Patrick Messmer said a tip led to surveillance footage that showed an individual known to police who was then able to identify other people in the video. 

Cabella was bought by Callaway and Hollinger, who found that the one-year-old pit bull mix, was 'too sweet tempered to fight' according to police.

In the surveillance video, it shows four people walking to the tracks with a dog and then two adults leave, but the teens remaining behind.

Hollinger threw Cabella into the woods and fired at her before she ran back home and rested, injured, on the porch, according to investigators.

Callaway and Hollinger then retrieved her taking her back as they tied her to the train tracks where Callaway allegedly fired several shots at her, before they both left the area.

Cabella was shot twice in the neck and once in the shoulder.

During the search warrant of a home where Cabella lived prior to the shooting, evidence of dog fighting as well as two dogs with injuries consistent with dog fighting were found at the home, according to investigators.

Officers discovered the blood-spattered pup after they received three 911 calls at around 5:23 p.m. on March 4 from people reporting hearing gunshots. They heard a dog whimpering while canvassing the neighborhood, and followed the sound to nearby train tracks

They heard a dog whimpering while canvassing the neighborhood, and followed the sound to nearby train tracks. 

Once they were at the scene, responding officers freed Cabella and immediately took her to the animal hospital. 

Her injuries were so severe that it was feared that the pup's front-right leg would need to be amputated, however, veterinarians were able to save the leg.

A post on the veterinarian's Facebook page read: 'Cabella came through surgery with flying colors and four legs. The surgeon decided to pin it instead of amputation. It will be 6 to 8 weeks before we know whether she will regain full use and motion.' 

On Wedneday evening following the police announcement that Cabella's attackers had been charged, Katy Meyer, owner of the veterinary practice posted her thanks to police and gave an update on Cabella's condition.

'Justice for Cabella, now that an arrest has been made!'

'We wish to thank the the Tampa Police Department for their thorough investigation into this horrible crime. We hope the individuals reponsible will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.'

She added: 'Cabella is doing very well, her bandage was removed last night and she is already bearing a small amount of weight on her leg. Her chances of making a full recovery are improving.'

Once Cabella fully recovers, she will be spayed, vaccinated and put up for adoption.

Hollinger and Callaway are scheduled to appear in court  on April 8.
