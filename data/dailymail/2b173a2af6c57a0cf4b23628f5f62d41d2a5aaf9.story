An email scam is currently circulating that offers a tax refund and asks for the recipients bank details.

The email, which  uses the official Australian Tax Office logo in a bid to look authentic, indicates that the recipient may have a tax refund which takes you to a website using myGov logos.

The official ATO Facebook page warns: 'To look out for SMS, emails and websites that ask for your personal or financial information, such as your date of birth, address, credit card details and PIN.'

ATO has been involved in a number of scams this year: In July, scammers posing as ATO employees managed to extort money from hundreds of victims

There have been a number of ATO scams this year. In July, scammers posing as Australian Tax Office employees were using personal data to extort money from hunderds of victims across the country.

Detective Superintendent Brian Hay from the Queensland Police Fraud and Cyber Crime Group told the ABC that ATO scams are increasingly prevalent.

He advised 'don't do personal information on a public access system, an internet cafe you're not going to do you financial or taxation business on such a machine, you want to make sure it's got the latest operating system.

'For example Windows XP, it doesn't cut it any more, it's not being patched, it's insecure, so you want an up-to-date operating system.

'You want to make sure it is patched appropriately every time it can be patched, you have it patched automatically.

Detective Superintendent Brian Hay warns not to access personal information on internet cafes, and also to ensure you only only use up-to-date operating systems

'That you've got the latest anti-virus patched on a daily basis, that you run regular systems scans.

'And from a behaviour perspective you've got to be a bit more disciplined about what you surrender to the internet, so you don't post too much personal information or post any photographs on a device that has activated the geo-locator settings because that's just telling the crooks where you are.'
