Gareth Southgate has urged England’s Under-21s to accept their toughest challenge and show they can win on the biggest stage.

England were pitted against Italy, Portugal and Sweden in Group B when the draw was made for next summer’s European Championships in the Czech Republic; the other group comprises the hosts, Germany, Denmark and Serbia.

Southgate’s confidence, though, has not been dented, particularly as they qualified for the finals in style with a 4-2 aggregate victory over Croatia last month. He will get an early idea how England may fare when they play Portugal next Thursday in a friendly at Burnley.

The main objective, however, is next June and given that England were knocked out of the group stages in the last two tournaments in Israel (2013) and Denmark (2011) without winning a game, Southgate appreciates England have to change perceptions.

‘It is a cracking group, a group to get excited about,’ Southgate told Sportsmail. ‘They are really good fixtures, they are fixtures that will capture the imagination. Yes, they are difficult teams but they are bound to be if you get to this stage. It is on to the next challenge.

‘We are effectively in the quarter-finals of this competition and I have never heard of anyone having any easy time at this stage. That is the mentality that we have got to have. If we want to win the tournament, which we do, then we cannot complain about who we have got to play.

‘You have to deal with whatever is thrown in front of you. If we want to be a winning team, that is how it must be. We’ve been very good at qualifying for tournaments but we have got to take that to the next stage. Now we have got to prove that we can be very good at tournaments.’

A delegation, headed by Southgate, will begin their search today for a suitable base next summer and with the group only having a restricted amount of time between now and next June, the head coach appreciates that every second counts.

‘What is important now is that we do not waste a single minute when we get together,’ said Southgate, whose squad will also face France in Brest this month. ‘Preparation, for the group as a whole, is limited and we have got to take advantage of the time we have together.

‘I am not quite sure how the (Portugal) team we play next week will compare to the one we play next summer. They have had a few players moved up to the senior team, as have we. But it will still be interesting. It will be a good test for us.’
