Phil Jones has celebrated his 2014 by treating his family and friends to a night at Manchester restaurant 'Wings', followed by a trip on the Boogie Bus.

The Manchester United defender was spotted leaving the Chinese restaurant on Monday night, chicken wing in hand as he made his way on to the party bus.

It has been a mixed year for the 22-year-old, who has struggled with injuries in recent months. Despite this, he travelled to his first World Cup with England and, now that he is fit, looks set to play regularly for Manchester United.

He and girlfriend Kaya Hall were part of a large group celebrating on Monday, as Jones was given a night out before United travel to Stoke on New Year's Day.

The restaurant is very popular with Manchester's footballers - Radamel Falcao celebrated his £6million loan move there in September, while Gary and Phil Neville enjoyed a night at Wings with Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt recently, too.

United have impressed over the last few weeks, propelling themselves up the Premier League table after an unstable start to the season.

Louis van Gaal's side sit third in the Premier League table, having extended a three-point gap over fourth-placed Southampton.

United played their second game in 48 hours at Tottenham on Sunday, picking up a point in their final match of 2014.

Louis van Gaal, speaking after the game, insisted it was impossible for his players to recover in the time they were given but Jones insisted they should not used the same old excuses.

'I think fatigue is always going to kick in with two games in three days but it's the same for every club in the Premier League,' the 22-year-old told MUTV.

'You have to do it, we have done it, and now we look forward to the game against Stoke on Thursday. 

'We created numerous chances in the first half and perhaps should have been three or four nil up at half-time, but it wasn't to be.

'In the second half they came out and pushed us to the end. We knew that would happen, but we stayed resilient and we kept a clean sheet.'

Maybe he should lay off the chicken wings, however.
