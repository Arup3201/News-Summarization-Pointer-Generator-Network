The name is a byword for style and sophistication.

And having made their name in sharp Italian tailoring, the Daily Mail can reveal that Armani now plans to open a £100million luxury hotel in the heart of London.

The fashion house is close to snapping up Admiralty Arch, the majestic gatehouse leading from Trafalgar Square to Buckingham Palace, and plans to offer rooms from December 2015.

But a full designer makeover will be required as the Grade I listed arch, built in memory of Queen Victoria in 1912, is in disrepair – a warren of dusty, dilapidated offices.

Admiralty Arch is close to being turned into a luxury Armani hotel in London.

Armani’s bid has not been made public, but a well-placed source has revealed the deal is at an advanced stage.

It was already known that the Government has leased the landmark to developers led by Spanish entrepreneur Rafael Serrano who was behind the glitzy Bulgari Hotel in Knightsbridge.

Mr Serrano stressed that the 100-year-old building’s period features would be painstakingly preserved.

Giorgio Armani is one of the most iconic designers alive today

Armani’s involvement follows the success of its hotels in Dubai and Milan.

It is looking at sleek marble fittings for between 80 to 100 guestrooms, royal and presidential suites, with initial estimates suggesting the bedrooms will each cost £600,000 to kit out.

A restaurant and bar will be open to the public. There will be shops too, selling the luxury label’s goods. It is understood Giorgio Armani himself would design every aspect of the hotel from the bespoke furnishings to the menus.

A source said: ‘Armani has been looking for the ideal London base for some time, and this is the result of a long search. It is a closely guarded secret but the plans are at an advanced stage.’

The developers, a London-based consortium called Prime Investors Capital, are liaising with the  Government on the security implications, due to the arch’s position overlooking Whitehall. Buckingham Palace has been consulted.

The deal depends on Westminster council granting planning permission, which will take at least six months as the proposals must be scrutinised by conservation experts.

Prime Investors Capital denied they had chosen an operator for the hotel. An Armani spokesman said its involvement was ‘unfounded rumours’.

A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘The restoration project that will see Admiralty Arch turned into a publicly accessible landmark hotel is still in the early planning stage.

‘No decisions on the hotel operator have been made. Prime Investors Capital are consulting their in-house advisers on hotel operations.’
