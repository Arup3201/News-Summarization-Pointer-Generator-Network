An alleged New York bail-jumper was arrested on his Pennsylvania college campus after he posed for a news photographer and police spotted his picture in the paper.

Authorities caught up to 25-year-old Jacob Close after he took part in the Bloomsburg Press Enterprise's weekly 'Your Opinion' feature, answering a question about the controversy over the Washington Redskins' name.

‘I think they should keep the same name but change the mascot to a potato,’ Close jokingly opined.

Joke's on him: Jacob Close, 25, a suspected bail-jumper was caught after he took part in the Bloomsburg Press Enterprise's weekly 'Your Opinion' feature, making a joke about the Washington Redskins name change controversy

Wanted man: Police say the mass communications student at Bloomsburg University jumped bail in a drug and drunken-driving case in Ithaca, New York, several months ago

Mr Close, who majors in mass communications, was evidently very proud of his spud wisecrack since on June 30, he shared a link to The Press Enterprise article featuring his picture and quote, and even helpfully provided the exact page number.

Police say Close jumped bail in a drug and drunken-driving case in Ithaca, New York, several years ago. The Press Enterprise reports he was arrested Sunday at Bloomsburg University's student recreation center.

Bragging rights: The 25-year-old was so proud of his spud joke he even shared a link to the article on his Facebook page

University police knew Close was wanted for more than a month after getting word from the Ithaca city Police, but they weren't aware he was on campus for the summer until his photo was published.

Last Monday, a campus officer spotted a familiar face in the opinion column and staked out Close’s blue Honda on campus until he finally nabbed the student Sunday afternoon, CBS DC reported .

Mr Close, a native of Wellsboro, was held on $25,000 bail pending extradition to New York.
