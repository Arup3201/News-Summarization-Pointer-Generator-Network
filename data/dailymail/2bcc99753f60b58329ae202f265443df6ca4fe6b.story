She recently won the coveted top spot on Maxim's Hot 100 list of the world's most beautiful women, so what's Candice Swanepoel's secret?

The Victoria's Secret model, who isn't one to shy away from the occasional 'belfie' - that's bum selfie to anyone who has been living under a rock - has shared her beauty and fitness secrets with Vogue.

Speaking to the fashion bible about her enviable physique, she said: 'Squats are the key! It's 
definitely squats! They work for me.

So THAT's her secret! Victoria's Secret model Candice Swanepoel has revealed that squats are what keeps in her enviable physique in checkÂ 

'If I've been on holiday and I feel 
like I haven't done enough, even 10 make me feel better. You know what's
 good - if you squat and when you come back up, you squeeze really hard.
 That works.'

The South African-born model, who has fronted countless high fashion campaigns, also explained that wearing really strong sunscreen is what keeps her skin in tip-top condition.

The 25-year-old also cites Bio Oil as a vanity bag essential and explains that she slathers it on after she's been for a dip in the sea.

When it comes to make-up, the natural beauty prefers the pared-back look and only uses a slick of mascara and a pop of blusher, even opting to go bare-faced in the day.

Although
 not married, Candice has been dating Brazilian model Hermann Nicoli 
since she was 17 and as a result, she's fluent in Portuguese.

Swanepoel's modelling 
career is going from strength to strength and she can 
currently be seen draping herself over a rock, in a barely-there white 
bikini, in a shoot for Maxim's June issue.

She also recently appeared at Victoria's Secret's Bond Street store alongside marketing director Ed Razek.

There,
 they announced the 2014 fashion show will cross the pond from its 
previous home in New York City to the capital at Earls Court on December
 2.

Candice
 will take to the runway in what promises to be a spectacular show in 
front of a crowd of 2,500 in the Earls Court Exhibition Centre - no doubt ramping up the number of daily squats in preparation.
