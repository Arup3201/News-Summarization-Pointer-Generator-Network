Australian jihadist Khaled Sharrouf has warned of a terrorist attack on home soil just days after the Australian Federal Police issued a warrant for his arrest.

Sharrouf, from Sydney, escaped authorities in December by using his brother Mustafa's passport to go and fight in Syria and Iraq with al-Qaeda off-shoot Islamic State.

He said in a letter to Fairfax Media this week that he would have carried out an attack on Australia if he hadn't left when he did.

Arrest warrants were issued for Sharrouf and fellow Sydney-man Mohamed Elomar after Daily Mail Australia revealed a disturbing photo of Elomar holding up two decapitated heads for the camera in Syria.

The picture was uploaded on Twitter on Friday by convicted terrorist Sharrouf.

The 31-year-old demanded the release of 12 Muslim prisoners in the letter.

One of the men who he called for the release of was Hyde Park rioter Ahmed Elomar. Ahmed is the brother of Mohamed Elomar - the man Sharrouf is fighting with in the Middle East.

Ahmed and Mohamed used to be champion boxers in their early twenties before they became radicalised in Sydney.

Ahmed was jailed in June for two and a half years for bashing a police officer in the Hyde Park Islamic march of 2012.

Sharrouf also claimed in his letter that he toyed with the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and police while he was under surveillance.

He wrote that he had been inspired to join the jihad because of the West's 'murderous' activities.

Sharrouf previously spent time in an Australian jail for his part in a foiled plot to blow up targets in Sydney and Melbourne.

Disgusting: Mohamed Elomar, who is believed to have left Australia last year to fight in Syria, is shown holding up the decapitated heads of two men

In a sickening image that Sharrouf posted on Twitter last week, Mohamed Elomar is seen smiling - with a pair of sunglasses tucked into his shirt - as he holds up two decapitated heads by the victims' hair.

Another image, uploaded on Friday, shows the heads of alleged Syrian solders being impaled on metal railings.

Like something out of the 18th century, the heads were left on show in a sickening display that aims to cause terror and fear.

The photos were uploaded by Sharrouf, alongside disgusting tweets such as 'bucket full of heads any1 in aus want some organs please dont be shy to ask I would love to assist u with body parts [sic]'.

The convicted terrorist said he wanted to cut 'infidel throats'

He directed his tweets to people in Australia and joked about organ donation

His disturbing rant continued 'few more heads how lovely bludy amazing stuff abuhafs u keep cutting those infidel throats but the last 1 is mine! [sic]'

The tweets came as the nation's Director General of Security David Irvine revealed 'tens of people' had already returned to Australian shores from fighting alongside suspected terrorist organisations.

Speaking to media earlier this month, Attorney-General George Brandis said engagement with the Islamic community was an important strategy 'to keep Australia free from terrorism'.

'The imams who are faith leaders, who are influential and respected opinion members in their communities, are integral to our goal to saving young men - it is almost always young men - in their communities from being radicalised,' he said.

Mr Irvine added a majority of the 60 Australians they were aware of fighting with Islamic radicals were siding against the government with Al-Qaeda off-shoots.

'We have some tens of people that have already returned [from the Middle East], we have probably another 150 we're looking at here in Australia who have inclinations to support those two extremist movements,' he said.

When asked if the ones who had returned to Australia were being actively monitored, Mr Irvine said 'I'm not saying anything further'.

On July 14, Sharrouf fired off a tweet to the AFP and Australians, saying: 'you cowards I am running to my death I want martyrdom thats [sic] why I am blessed u rock spiders'.

Just half an hour earlier, he claimed 'Australia belongs to the muslims not infidels like you' as well as boasting of his evasion of police.

'u can't stop and trust me if I wanted to attack aus I could have easily,' Sharrouf said.

He also added: 'I love to slaughter [Australians] & ALLAH LOVEs when u dogs r slaughtered'.

These threatening tweets are part of a more disturbing picture of Sharrouf painted by his Twitter account.

Some of the content is so graphic that Daily Mail Australia has chosen not to publish the posts.

On July 14, Sharrouf tweeted he loved to slaughter Australians to the AFP

He said it would have been easy for him to attack Australia if he wanted
