An exhausted kestrel which found itself 25 miles out to sea hitched a ride back to shore on the shoulder of a yachtswoman.

Carol Raffe, 57, was sailing to the Suffolk coast from the Netherlands with husband Max Raffe, 55, when she felt a tapping on her neck.

She turned to her left and saw the large bird of prey - normally only found on dry land - staring back at her.

Hitching a ride: A wayward kestrel landed on a Suffolk couple's yacht in the middle of the North Sea

'Like a seasoned sailor': Having tried and failed to take flight again, the bird settled down in the cockpit

The kestrel, which they've since nicknamed Lucky, then hopped onto the deck of the  30ft Cornish pilot cutter before becoming spooked and taking off again.

But the battered bird could only circle the mast once before flopping into the water.

Fortunately it mustered enough energy to flap back on board, and sat with its new shipmates for the next four hours.

It eventually left Carol and Max as they sailed into the mouth of the river Deben, Suffolk.

It is believed the wayward animal had been blown off course by strong easterly winds.

Carol, an occupational therapist of Crowfield, Suffolk, said: 'There was nothing in sight except a nearby wind farm.

Exhausted: The bird eventually left the yacht four hours later, when it reached the river Deben

'So I was completely stunned when the bird landed my shoulder. We just could not work out how a land bird was so far out at sea.

'My shock must have made it decide to move off and it then settled among the coiled mainsheet by my side.

'We tried to give her food as she looked absolutely famished but it seemed to spook her and she took flight - weirdly landing on the water.

'As she is a land bird we became terrified that she might drown as she would have no natural swimming skills.

'But she managed to regain herself before landing on my husband’s shoulder and then settled down on the boat and stayed with us for four-and-a-half hours.

'She was like a seasoned sailor and just pottered about the boat and did seem to care about us at all.

'She must have realised we posed no threat and were her only chance of survival. The kestrel eventually left us when we reached the River Deben.

'She then flew top Ramsholt Church which overlooks the river, perhaps for a quick prayer of thanksgiving or more likely a hunt for a long awaited meal of Church mouse.'

Max, a local Scout leader and technical designer for BT, was astonished when the bird landed on his wife’s shoulder.

He said: 'I could not believe it. It is odd to see a bird of prey so far out to see but for it to land on my wife’s shoulder completely out of the blue is just incredible.

'There was a strong easterly wind at the time so we think it must have been blown out to sea from the Suffolk coat.

'It would have died if our boat was not there. You hear about these stories out at sea but you never think they will happen to you - it was really fascinating.'

Kestrels are usually found in open farm land or near uncultivated grassland.

They are a a bird of prey and tend to eat field voles, mice, shrews, moles, rats, frogs, and lizards.

The species is in decline in the UK due to the loss of food and farmland habitat.
