Former top women's football chief David Dein sent one of the e-mails which led to a sexism scandal engulfing Premier League boss Richard Scudamore, it has been claimed.

Mr Dein, a former President of Arsenal Ladies FC who has spoken out firmly for women's rights, is accused by the Daily Mirror of sending a joke about 'skinny big-t***** broads' to Mr Scudamore.

Premier League chief executive Mr Scudamore has apologised and is facing calls to quit after he forwarded the sexist email and several others to a lawyer friend.

Claims: A newspaper report accused David Dein, pictured, of sending a sexist e-mail to Richard Scudamore

The scandal erupted this week after a former temporary PA to Mr Scudamore leaked several e-mails to the Sunday Mirror.

Sports Minister Helen Grant branded the content of the e-mails 'completely unacceptable' while her Labour counterpart, Clive Efford, voiced fears the Premier League could take action against the woman who leaked the e-mails.

'There
 is a role for whistleblowers in public life and what has been published
 shows she was right to make these emails public, as this is a matter of
 public concern,' he said.

'If the league take legal action against her that would be outrageous.'

FA chairman Greg Dyke and league sponsor Barclays have voiced concerns while DLA Piper, the firm which employs Mr Scudamore's lawyer friend, has launched an investigation.

Hot water: Premier League Chairman Richard Scudamore has been in trouble for some inappropriate emails

MailOnline has contacted Mr Dein asking him to respond to the Daily Mirror's claims. The 70-year-old, who lives in north London, has not yet responded publicly.

A former vice-chairman of both Arsenal FC and the FA, Mr Dein helped create the Premier League in 1992 and opened the first ladies' youth academy to be funded by a men's Premier League club in 2000.

At the time, he said: 'It is not a publicity 
stunt. Ladies football is a serious sport within its own right.

'There 
were 90,000 at the World Cup final and there will be more and more on 
TV.'

Since then, Mr Dein has repeatedly spoken out against sexism in football.

He was the President of Arsenal Ladies FC and at one point, he said: 'It's hypocrisy for football to call itself a family game and then keep women out of the boardroom.'

Disapproving: FA chairman Greg Dyke has said that Scudamore's emails are totally inappropriate

In a statement earlier this week, Mr Scudamore said the messages were 'private emails exchanged between colleagues and friends 
of many years' that should not have been accessed by the temporary 
employee.

He accepted they were inappropriate and added: 'It was an 
error of judgment that I will not make again'.

Anger: Sports Minister Helen Grant condemned the content of the e-mails as unacceptable

An email from Scudamore sent to club chiefs just before the Sunday Mirror's publication became public this week.

In it he states the story has 'been obviously timed for our last day for it to cause maximum embarrassment to me and therefore the Premier League.

'The newspaper is asserting that some of the content is sexist and inappropriate. You will be the judge.'

That prompted football equality campaigner Edward Lord, who chairs the London FA Inclusion Advisory Group, to question Scudamore's position yesterday.

He wrote on his blog: 'This seeming refusal to accept that the content of his emails were in fact sexist and inappropriate to my mind completely undermines his public apology, and leads to only one conclusion: that it was insincere and therefore unsustainable in the court of public opinion.

'If it is that Richard Scudamore didn't believe that what he had written was wrong less than a week ago, I think that it is highly unlikely that he has come to that conclusion in any reality since. On that basis it appears to me that his position is now looking untenable.

'If Scudamore doesn't accept the heinous nature of his sexist remarks and the impact they have had, not only on women in the game, but on the perception they create of football's commitment to equality and inclusion in general, then regrettably I must reach the conclusion that he may be in the wrong job.'
