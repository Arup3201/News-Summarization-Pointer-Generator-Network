Jailed: Andrew Tahmooressi is currently cooling his heels in a Mexican jail

A Marine jailed in Mexico for bringing illegal firearms into the country insists his arrest is a mistake and that he should be allowed to go back to San Diego.

Sergeant Andrew Tahmooressi, 25, and originally from Weston, Florida, insisted to Mexican officials he landed south of the border March 31 after a wrong turn and that his guns were legally purchased and licensed in the U.S. – they jailed him anyway.

Mother Jill Tahmooressi told WBFS that her son insisted the whole thing is a misunderstanding, that he should be set free and allowed to leave the country, and she agrees.

‘I can understand why the Mexican officials needed to investigate,’ she told the station. 

‘But 72 hours later they surely had the evidence that those guns were traced, legally purchased, traced to his name, no criminal record, a Marine whose been honorably discharged.’

Her criticism came hours after finding out he was being transferred to a new jail for his own safety and days after he gave a scathing interview to the San Diego Union-Tribune.

‘I said, ‘I have three guns’ and I showed them where the guns were and they checked out the guns and I said, ‘I didn’t even mean to be in Mexico. It was a mistake for me to be here. Can I just go back to the border?’ He told the paper.

‘Five minutes later I was surrounded by like 20 military officials and police officers with guns watching me.’

The honorably discharged Marine who served two tours in Afghanistan was soon arrested for weapons smuggling, and said he then had his life threatened.

‘The people in there they started messing with me,’ he recalled. ‘They were trying to make me more scared than I already was.’

His worried mother says the combat veteran moved west to get treatment for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and that being shot at while trying to escape probably wasn’t ideal, bu that he’s remained calm under pressure.

Nearly two dozen U.S. lawmakers sent a letter this week to the Mexican government urging a quick release of the former Marine, according to The Blaze. Their plea has gone unanswered.

Dozens of people also protested Thursday in front of the Mexican consulate in Miami.

‘I can tell that he’s just being as gracious and polite as a fine Marine would be,’ she told the station.

He appears to be keeping in good spirits despite his next court hearing not being until May 28.

‘I had no intentions of smuggling my weapons,’ he said. ‘I had no intention of selling them or anything of that sort. I’m a pretty decent guy. I’m a pretty good man with good morals. I believe in God. I put my faith in God that he’ll take care of me.’

Jill Tahmooressi is for now holding out hope her son is released either before the hearing or shortly after it.
