Michael Lohan made it clear he's not a fan of his daughter's attorney before she arrived for her hearing today in Los Angeles.

But if there was any doubt as to his disdain for Mark Heller, the patriarch made it known as Lindsay Lohan accepted a plea bargain in her reckless driving case on Monday.

Objecting to the New York-attorney's presence in the middle of the hearing, Michael demanded: 'Why are you still up there?!' and launched a vitriolic attack on Heller as he left the courthouse.

Vitriol: Michael Lohan launched a verbal attack at Lindsay Lohan's lawyer, Mark Heller, as the attorney left a Los Angeles courthouse on Monday

The 52-year-old celebrity father held his own press conference after the proceedings.

But as Heller walked by he was compelled to stop what he was doing and lunged at the lawyer, accusing him of using Lindsay for publicity.

Lohan also accused Heller of owing him money and made further claims he isn't licensed to practice law in New York.

Nothing to say: Heller bowed his head as Lohan raged

Demands: Lohan claimed he has proof Heller does not have a license to practice law in New York

Heller walked by, bowing his head, and did not appear to engage with the patriarch.

The scene unfolded shortly after Lindsay  pleaded no contest Monday to reckless driving, lying to police and obstructing officers who were investigating a car accident involving the actress in Santa Monica last June.

The Liz & Dick star was on probation when her sports car crashed on Pacific Coast Highway while on her way to a film shoot.

As part of her plea deal with prosecutors, she will be required to attend 90 days in a locked rehab facility, perform 30 days of community labour and commit to 18 months of psychological therapy.

will be there Monday': Fox News legal analyst David Wohl from Orange 
County criminal law firm Wallin & Klarich stepped up with an offer 
to represent Lohan

The deal followed over two hours of talks behind closed doors in the judge's chambers between her legal team and prosecutors.

A mandatory sentence of five days in jail will be included in her rehab stay, which she will be able to complete in her native New York.

She was also found in violation of her probation in a 2011 necklace theft and sentenced to 180 days in jail. However, she will be able to avoid jail time if she complies with the conditions of her plea deal

Lohan was also ordered not to have any contact with drug users and must submit to regular drug testing.

The actress' father was present throughout the proceedings, having secured local criminal attorney David Wohl of Wallin & Klarich as alternate counsel for his daughter should she approve a change in her legal team.

'@lindsaylohan My law firm was hired by your Dad. He wants nothing but the best for you. We will be there Monday to help, if we're allowed,' Wohl tweeted on Friday.

Heller had drawn ire from a judge who questioned his knowledge of California law during a pre-trial hearing but Lindsay did not appear to have signed Wohl on as his adviser.

Heller has meanwhile been accused 
witness tampering amid claims he tried to coerce Lohan's assistant, 
Gavin Doyle, into saying he was behind the wheel during Lindsay's June car crash.

According to TMZ,
the Santa Monica City Attorney 'will be launching an 
investigation and will interview Lohan's ex-assistant Gavin Doyle 
tomorrow in the presence of police'.

Heller has denied the accusations.

Michael Lohan's tirade was only the latest act in a media circus on Monday, after Lindsay arrived 48 minutes late to the hearing.

She's late: Her appearance drew a crowd that had waited over an hour for her to show

The Liz & Dick actress skipped 
her flight on Saturday to see a band called City of the Sun at The Red 
Door club in Manhattan.

She then decided to get off her flight back to Los Angeles on Sunday night after deeming the plane too unsafe.

At the last minute she secured a flight aboard a private jet provided by a Los Angeles-based energy drink company for which she has made promotional appearances, and had to reroute to LAX to avoid being obscenely late for the hearing.

Forty-eight minutes after she was due to arrive, Lindsay finally made her entrance.

Lindsay has been under some form of probation since she was arrested twice in 2007 for driving under the influence, and her court troubles have stifled a once-promising career.

Did it save the day? Lohan tweeted this message early Monday morning as she boarded a private plane in a race to make her court appearance, although she arrived 48 minutes late

Her return to acting last year in the Lifetime movie Liz & Dick was widely panned by critics and viewers. Her upcoming film by Bret Easton Ellis, The Canyons, co-starring porn star James Deen, is yet to be released.

The Playboy cover girl will next be seen in InAPPropriate Comedy - due out on March 22 - alongside Rob Schneider, Michelle Rodriguez and Adrien Brody.

Lohan will also star in horror spoof Scary Movie 5, set for release on April 12.
