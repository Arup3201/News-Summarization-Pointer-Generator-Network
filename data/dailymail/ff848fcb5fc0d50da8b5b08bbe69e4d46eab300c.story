Arthur Sinodinos, who has been the subject of investigations by corruption watchdog ICAC, resigned as Assistant Treasurer on Friday, fuelling rumours the Prime Minister is about to reshuffle his Cabinet.

Mr Abbott has publicly stated that changes were on the cards and there are reports that the front-bench overhaul could take place as early as this weekend.

The PM's recent concession that 'there are one or two barnacles still on the ship but by Christmas they will have been dealt with' does not bode well for under fire Defence Minister David Johnston.

Last month he gained notoriety for his statement about Australian Submarine Corporation in parliament of 'you wonder why I wouldn't trust them to build a canoe?'.

The ICAC findings on Senator Arthur Sinodinos, due early next year, was seen as pivotal to the major reshuffle of the Federal Cabinet, however, the Senate officially resigned as Assistant Treasurer on Friday

Tony Abbott's flagging popularity, which sees him trailing Opposition Leader Bill Shorten by eight points as preferred PM and the Coalition's dip in voter support has a major Cabinet reshuffle on the cards

There are suggestions Tony Abbott could dump David Johnston from the defence portfolio as early as this weekend but any moves against the embattled Defence Minister could ignite tensions with Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, a known supporter of the Senator  

Pivotal to the shake-up by Tony Abbott will be two roles; the troubled portfolio of defence under the watch of Senator Johnston and the Assistant Treasurer position now relinquished by Senator Sinodinos.

A minor reshuffle of the ranks could be put in place before the new working week while a major overhaul of the senior ministry is more likely by the end of January.

Asked recently whether it was time to reshape the Coalition front-bench, Mr Abbott said 'at some stage between now and the next election, quite probably, but this is a good front-bench'.

Three weeks ago he conceded it had been a tough year at the top and famously stated 'there are one or two barnacles still on the ship but by Christmas they will have been dealt with'.

The Sydney Morning Herald reports that a source believes 'the threshold question is Arthur (Sinodinos). The PM doesn't want Arthur to be in the mix but he is'.

Mr Abbott was waiting on the outcome of the ICAC inquiry into Senator Sinodinos, which was due in January but could now be delayed. It's believed he will escape any official sanctions over the inquiry into his involvement with Australian Water Holdings.

The need, in the eyes of some senior MPs, to get Senator Sinodinos back in the fold as soon as possible was given more currency due to the pressure which has steadily built on Treasurer Joe Hockey over his stalled Budget measures.

Senator David Johnston (seated) has been under intense pressure since claiming parliament that he would trust the ASC to 'build canoes' and revelations of lavish wining and dining

But Senator Sinodinos will not return to that prominent position, after announcing his resignation effective Friday.

The newspaper also claims that Mr Abbott favours a tweak of the front-bench ahead of bigger changes nearing the end of next year, leading into the 2016 poll.

Still, any moves against the Defence Minister could ignite tensions between the PM and the Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, a known supporter of Senator Johnston.

The success of Ms Bishop, however, has led to internal calls for more women to ascend to the Coalition front-bench with Higgins MP, Kelly O'Dwyer, seen as a likely candidate for promotion.

With the opinion polls showing the Prime Minister and Coalition losing popularity fast, a reshuffle is seen as pivotal by senior Coalition members.

Mr Abbott now trails Opposition Leader Bill Shorten by 8 points as preferred prime minister, 47 to 39 and Labor holds a four point lead on two-party preferred basis, 52 per cent to 48.
