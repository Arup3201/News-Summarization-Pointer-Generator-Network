Not even losing a limb can dampen the spirits of 'Sydney's Happiest Amputee' - Mathew McHugh.

It has only been three months since the keen paraglider lost his left leg after crashing into a cliff at the headland between Monavale beach and Warriewood in the Northern Beaches.

And the good-humoured 32-year-old could not wait to capture his first night out to dinner in his wheelchair with friends on video.

Mathew McHugh, (pictured on his birthday in May), is so grateful about surviving the accident that he calls himself 'Sydney's Happiest Amputee'

Mr McHugh, (pictured in hospital with his friends on his birthday last month), captured on video his first night out since the accident three months ago, and declared: 'This is the first night of freedom in my new life.'

He had a paragliding accident on April 2 and had to have his left leg amputated so he is raising funds for his ongoing physio and for a prosthetic leg

‘This is the first night of freedom in my new life,’ a cheerful Mr McHugh says to the camera before adding; ‘Well, I get three hours of release from my rehabilitation centre.’

‘It was a great night out,’ Mr McHugh told 9 Stories. ‘It felt amazing to be out there and given a second chance, really amazing.’

Proudly taking on the title of 'Sydney's Happiest Amputee', Mr McHugh’s positive attitude is nothing short of inspirational.

‘I'm just happy to be alive,’ Mr Mchugh said. ‘I actually get more upset about being woken up at midnight for a tablet than the accident itself.’

Mr McHugh's infectious happy-go-lucky attitude has struck a chord with the public.

A fund set up to help cover the cost of his medical bills has already surpassed the $7,000 goal, prompting his family to set up a new fund to help with the ongoing costs of prosthesis.

‘This week I'm getting the first initial part of my leg, but the costs are going to be quite consistent, so any small change that someone can drop into the bucket will help,’ he said.

Mr McHugh credits his positive outlook to the ongoing support he has received not only from his family and friends, but also from the rescuers and the team at the Graythwaite Rehabilitation Centre in Ryde.

‘First thing I said to my family when I woke up was; “I'm here, oh cool, awesome”,’ Mr McHugh said.

‘Then I looked down and saw the leg and told my family “oh it'll grow back” – they thought I was being serious and that the hospital drugs must’ve gotten to me.’

‘I can't go back and change time. I've been given a second chance at life, that's the way I look at it,’ he said. ‘Sure, I've lost a bit of a leg but I've been given a second life.’

Looking ahead, Mr McHugh now plans to pay the charity forward, and hopes to one day use his message to raise funds for other amputees.

‘It's like a circle of life,’ he said. ‘I can't wait for the moment that I can walk right into the room of the people that saved me and shake their hands. That will be amazing.’
