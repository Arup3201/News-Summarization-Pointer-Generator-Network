It took 72 minutes for Radamel Falcao to get on the pitch in the Emirates Cup curtain-raiser. After six months and one World Cup were wasted to injury, Monaco’s staff and supporters probably won’t mind waiting a little longer for a goal from their £53million striker.

Their unease is more likely to centre on whether they see much more of him at all, with the Colombian reportedly close to a move to Real Madrid.

That particular saga provided the main talking point before and during a 2-2 draw that occasionally thrilled but, more often, looked rather fittingly like a pre-season friendly.

Return: Radamel Falcao featured in the second half as Monaco drew 2-2 with Valencia in the Emirates Cup

Lay off: The Colombian missed the World Cup through injury and has been linked with a move to Real Madrid

Bow: Falcao replaces Dimitar Berbatov in the 72nd minute of Monaco's draw with Valencia

Familiar faces: Ricardo Carvalho (left), who scored an own goal, and Berbatov (right) in action for Monaco

Valencia: Alvés; Barragán, Vezo, Otamendi, Cissokho; Parejo (Gil 70), Gomes (Guardado 70), Fuego; Feghouli (Piatti 46), Rodrigo (Alcacer 60), De Paul (Ibanez 60).

Goals: Carvalho (og) 37, Alcacer 70. 

Monaco: Subasic; Fabinho (Bakayoko 80), Carvalho (Raggi 70), Abdennour, Kurzawa (Elderson 60); Toulalan (Dirar 60), Moutinho, Kondogbia (Carrasco 46); Martial (Ocampos 60), Berbatov (Falcao 72), Germain.

Goals: Vezo (og) 20, Ocampos 80. 

Perhaps the biggest surprise was that the principality side in a financial bubble often looked so clueless against a Spanish club that has seen much better days.

With Falcao on the bench, the mood in a largely empty Emirates Stadium was subdued, almost as if Monaco didn’t have £40m of talent in their midfield pairing of Joao Moutinho and Geoffrey Kondogbia. Sadly for those who did turn up, Monaco initially played as if they didn’t have them, either.

For the first half an hour, before taking the lead, Monaco were ineffective.

Within eight minutes, Valencia had them rattled, Dani Parejo releasing Antonio Barragan down the right, with the full back crossing to Rodrigo de Paul, who fired over.

At the other end Dimitar Berbatov sauntered and flicked, touched and dipped. He even tracked a few runs and his backheel to find Valere Germain was typical. So was the booing each time the former Tottenham forward took possession.

Valencia had another good opportunity after quarter of an hour when Andres Gomes side-stepped Fabinho on the left and crossed to the far post. Sofiane Feghouli, a fine player in this faded club, outjumped Aymen Abdennour but his pointblank header went straight at Danijel Subasic.

On target: Paco Alcacer scores Valencia's second goal to give them the lead at the Emirates

On terms: Lucas Ocampos equalised 10 minutes from time to earn Monaco a draw

At that point Valencia were cruising; Monaco sightseeing. But with 30 minutes played Moutinho, a £22m man, made a telling contribution, delivering the corner that Abdennour glanced via a Ruben Vezo deflection beyond Aly Cissokho on the line.

The lead was harsh, but it only lasted seven minutes.

Ricardo Carvalho had the final touch, sliding and knocking into his own goal after Barragan swept in a low cross from the right.

Rodrigo, once an unremarkable loan signing at Bolton but now one of the brightest players in Valencia’s side, came close with a flick and shot early in the second half. But Valencia were soon ahead when Paco Alcacer finished from close range after Aly Cissokho crossed from the left.

Monaco levelled with 10 minutes remaining, substitute Lucas Ocampos taking position in Valencia’s half and running at Vezo. The defender offered a sight of goal and Ocampos drilled a low shot past Diego Alves from 20 yards.
