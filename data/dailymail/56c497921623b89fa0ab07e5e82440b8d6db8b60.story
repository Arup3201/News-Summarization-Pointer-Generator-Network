Liverpool may be forced to sack Brendan Rodgers if results do not improve dramatically, according to Anfield legend Steve Nicol.

Rodgers has made a point of saying that some defeats ‘can be the making’ of you but there is no doubt the criticism of his team, results and himself will be stinging him. 

Take this from Nicol, whose medals in a 13-year Anfield career include a European Cup.

‘If things don’t change then ultimately Brendan will pay the price,’ said Nicol. 

‘If this team keeps performing the way they are, I don’t think they’ll have another option. We are not even halfway through and most people don’t expect Liverpool to get into the top four.

‘You wonder where this team are going. He has tried to add to the squad to make it better. Somehow it has turned the other way.

'The team are completely rudderless. They don’t look to have any imagination going forward and defensively they look at odds. This is a desperate time for Liverpool.’

The reaction to Liverpool's elimination from the Champions League on social media and radio phone-ins saw some supporters ask for him to be removed, less than seven months after being named LMA Manager of the Year, but there is no chance owners FSG will dispense with him soon after giving him a new contract.

What they do expect, is to be back in the top four come May. If Rodgers is to achieve that, he needs to get results. Fast.
