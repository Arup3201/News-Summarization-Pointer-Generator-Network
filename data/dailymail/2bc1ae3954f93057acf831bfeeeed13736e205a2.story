A Morrisons worker has been suspended after a mother accused her of smacking her four-year-old son across the legs.

Police were called to the supermarket in Chorley, Lancashire, after the incident at lunchtime on Wednesday while the mother was out shopping.

The staff member insisted the incident was a misunderstanding and police took no action.

Outraged: Selina Johnson, with her son Max, aged four, posted about the encounter on Facebook

But a post about the encounter was circulated widely in the area on Facebook.

The message by Selina Johnson
 said: 'Today I had the worst experience any parent could have today one
 of your staff smacked my four-year-old’s legs.

'My poor little boy cried his heart out.

'I have complained to the store manager and called the police who will be taking a statement and we will be pressing charges.

'I will never set foot in on one of your stores again.'

The message was posted publicly to Morrisons, which has more than 300,000 fans on Facebook.

A spokesman for Morrisons confirmed 
the incident had taken place and that police had attended the store 
after a complaint was made.

The spokesman said: 'The member of staff in question has been suspended pending a disciplinary next week.'

But he added that after discussions with all parties, police would not be pressing charges.

A Lancashire Police spokesman said: 'It
 was reported to us but it was settled by community resolution.

happy with the outcome.

 member of staff was spoken to and said she tapped a child in a friendly
 manner but realised afterwards this may have been misjudged.
