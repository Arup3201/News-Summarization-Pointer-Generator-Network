Alastair Cook insisted he would be leading England at next year’s World Cup — despite falling for just one run as Sri Lanka clinched the one-day series in Pallekele.

Cook’s latest failure with the bat was part of a dismal 90-run defeat for England, who now trail 4-2 in this seven-match series.

He also dropped a crucial catch, putting down Kumar Sangakkara on 41. The Sri Lanka batsman went on to make a match-winning 112. 

Alastair Cook says his dropping of Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara on 41 was a 'really costly drop'

Cook takes the field for what would be a tough day at the office for the England captain in the sixth ODI

Cook, the England captain, said: ‘Days like these don’t make the job any easier. It’s tough, not scoring the runs I’d like. It’s not a great place to be as a captain. I’m a better player than I’m showing at the moment. I’ve just got to keep going.’

Cook, who averages 17 in this series and has made only one half-century in his last 21 one-day innings, was confirmed as World Cup captain a week ago and seems to be in no mood to relinquish the job.

But when coach Peter Moores was asked by Sky Sports to confirm Cook’s captaincy, he said: ‘We review everything at the end of every series. We’ve always said that.

‘We make no bones that we’re passionate to try to get our best side to go out and win a World Cup. Cook needs runs but he’s also had some great times as an England player. He’s in a tough patch but that’s something he’s working hard to get out of.’

Cook acknowledged his drop of man of the match Kumar Sangakkara was damaging as England lost the sixth one-day international against Sri Lanka in Pallekele.

Sangakkara, dropped by Cook at mid off on 41, hit a run-a-ball 112 at the Pallekele International Stadium in his last one-day international on his home ground.

It set up a 90-run success which consigns England to a series defeat with one match to play.

Cook said afterwards on Sky Sports: 'It didn't help, me dropping "Sanga" on 40 was a really costly drop

'That was a really big catch to drop at that time because we'd built up quite a lot of pressure on them.

'It was probably a 260 (run) wicket and credit to him, he made us pay for that.'  

After putting down Sangakkara, who got 112, Cook was out LBW to Sachithra Senanayake for just one

England coach Moores said: 'We felt we could draw the series level today but we've been outplayed in all departments.

'We probably bowled our best up front. Towards the end our plans have to be a bit clearer, a bit simpler. Not just bowling yorkers but matching the ball you bowl to the field you've got, although the yorker is still a great ball if you bowl it well.

'We made some errors and didn't field as well as we could have.' 

Sri Lanka captain Angelo Matthews said: 'It was a challenging wicket to bat on but 'Sanga' was amazing once again.

'Together with (Tillakaratne) Dilshan, they were brilliant and set the tone for us to launch at the end.

'The older he (Sangakkara) gets, the more runs he scores.'

Sangakkara himself added: 'It's great to have grown up in Kandy and gone to school here ... to play one of my last games here is a special feeling.

'I've had a wonderful career and it's extra special to finish off with a win.'
