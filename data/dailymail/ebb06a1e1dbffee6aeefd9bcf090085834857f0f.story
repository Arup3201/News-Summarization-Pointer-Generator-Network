Twenty years ago world leaders met for the first ever climate change summit but new figures show that since then the globe has become hotter and weather has become more weird.

Numbers show that carbon dioxide emissions are up, the global temperature has increased, sea levels are rising along with the earth's population.

The statistics come as more than 190 nations opened talks on Monday at a United Nations global warming conference in Lima, Peru.

It is hoped the summit will pave the way for an international treaty on climate change, which would follow on from the first ever Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, where leaders pledged to try and tackle climate change. 

Now data since 1983 has been analysed to show how the global climate is changing.

And Professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University Michael Oppenheimer said: 'Simply put, we are rapidly remaking the planet and beginning to suffer the consequences.'

WILD WEATHER 

The first figures show that since 1992, there have been more than 6,600 major climate, weather and water disasters worldwide, causing more than $1.6 trillion in damage and killing more than 600,000 people, according to the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters in Belgium, which tracks the world's catastrophes.

While climate-related, not all can be blamed on man-made warming or climate change.

But, extreme weather has noticeably increased over the years, says Debby Sapir, who runs the centre and its database.

From 1983 to 1992 the world averaged 147 climate, water and weather disasters each year. Over the past 10 years, that number has jumped to an average 306 a year.

In the United States, an index of climate extremes — hot and cold, wet and dry — kept by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has jumped 30 percent from 1992 to 2013, not counting hurricanes, based on 10-year averages.

Worldwide, the 10-year average for weather-related losses adjusted for inflation was $30 billion a year from 1983-92, according to insurance giant Swiss Re.

From 2004 to 2013, the cost was more than three times that on average, or $131 billion a year.

Ms Sapir and others say it would be wrong to pin all, or even most, of these increases on climate change alone.

But they note a trend of growing extremes and more disasters, and that fits with what scientists have long said about global warming.

TEMPERATURE

The average annual temperature for 2014 is on track to be 14.6 degrees Celsius, compared with 14.1 degrees Celsius in 1992

In terms of temperature, 2014 is set to be the warmest in record, with the globe breaking six monthly heat records in 2014 and 47 since 1992. The last monthly cold record set was in 1916.

The average annual temperature for 2014 is on track to be 14.6 degrees Celsius, compared with 14.1 degrees Celsius in 1992.

OCEANS 

Meanwhile, the world's oceans have risen by about three inches since 1992 and become more acidic, by about half a per cent,  thanks to chemical reactions caused by the absorption of carbon dioxide, scientists at NOAA and the University of Colorado say.

The National Snow and Ice Data Centre also report that every year, sea ice cover shrinks to a yearly minimum size in the Arctic in September — a measurement that is considered a key climate change indicator.

Data from NASA shows that sea levels have also continued to rise as a result of climate change 

From 1983 to 1992, the lowest it got on average was 2.62 million square miles. Now the 10-year average is down to 1.83 million square miles

That loss, an average 790,000 square miles since 1992, overshadows the slight gain in sea ice in Antarctica, which has seen an average gain of 110,000 square miles of sea ice over the past 22 years.

ON LAND 

Within the same time frame, the world's population has also risden from 5.46 billion in 1992 to 7.18 billion today, meaning it is a third higher.

This means more carbon pollution and more people who could be vulnerable to global warming.

By 2012, large parts of the ice cap has melted while carbon dioxide pollution has steadily increased 

And some of the biggest climate change effects on land are near the polar ice caps.

From 1992 to 2011, Greenland's ice sheet lost 3.35 trillion tons of ice, according to calculations made by scientists using measurements from NASA's GRACE satellite while Antarctica lost 1.56 trillion tons of ice over the same period.

THE AIR

At the same time, carbon dioxide pollution has increased steadily by 60 per cent from 1992 to 2013.

In 1992, the world spewed 24.9 billion tons of carbon dioxide, now it is 39.8 billion, according to the Global Carbon Project, an international consortium.

China has tripled its emissions from 3 billion tons to 11 billion tons a year but emissions from the U.S. have gone up more slowly, by about 6 percent, from 5.4 billion tons to 5.8 billion tons.

India also has tripled its emissions, from 860 million tons to 2.6 billion tons with only European countries seeing their emissions go down, from 4.5 billion tons to 3.8 billion tons.

Now scientists are warning that world leaders have caused global warming to spiral out of control despite knowing the climate was changing.

Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University said: 'Overall, what really strikes me is the missed opportunity.

'We knew by the early 1990s that global warming was coming, yet we have done essentially nothing to head off the risk. I think that future generations may be justifiably angry about this.

While Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State added: 'Greenhouse gases are rising steadily and the cause is fossil fuel burning and other human activities. The globe is warming, ice is melting and our climate is changing as a result.'
