The eerie hum of thousands of potentially deadly arrows pouring down on to the field of Agincourt is set to be recreated for the first time in six centuries.

An ambitious project is underway to allow up to 1,000 archers to recreate Henry V’s celebrated victory in northern France.

It was 598 years ago today – also a Friday – that the English king’s heavily outnumbered army defeated a French force close to the small town of Azincourt, as it is spelt in French.

But the 600th anniversary of October 25th 1415 will be a far more significant one, with historians on both sides of the Channel already suggesting ways of commemorating it.

The Agincourt Alliance, an Anglo-French re-enactment group supported by the town’s historical centre and local tourist agencies, is now proposing a ‘Big Shoot’.

The Alliance’s website reads: ‘We want to recreate an arrow storm with at least 1,000 archers,’ adding: ‘We need a minimum 1,000 archer block to try and recreate Henry V's first arrow volley made in 1415. Each archer will need a minimum 30 suitably specified arrows.’

Moment in history: There are a few reminders in Agincourt, pictured as it is today, that the fields around the village had been the scene of a pivotal battle between old foes England and France

Outnumbered but victorious: Exactly 598 years ago today, the English king's heavily outnumbered army defeated a French force near the small town of Agincourt

This means rubber blunted arrows fitted with long wooden shafts and fletched with real white feathers.

The
 Alliance adds: ‘This event will also give an opportunity to historians 
and academics alike to confirm or review their opinions of this battle, 
was the English archer as decisive as believed?’

When battle commenced at 11 a.m. on October 25, the English army was seemingly destined for annihilation. 

Numbering around 20,000, the French army was fresh, well-equipped and disciplined.

Their opponents were depleted to about 5,000 men after two months of exhausting campaigning. But it has a secret weapon: their archers.

The French were met by a furious 
bombardment of artillery from the English archers, who wielded 
innovative longbows with a range of 250 yards.

French knights were totally unprepared to meet that weapon.

Weighed down with heavy armour and become bogged down on the narrow and slightly upward sloping battlefield, they were a sitting target.

As more knights entered the battle they became even more vulnerable to a cascade of deadly arrows.

Almost 6,000 Frenchmen lost their lives during the Battle of Agincourt, while English deaths amounted to just over 400.

The stunning victory turned the tide for the English during the Hundred Years' War (1337–1453) for control of the French throne.

Henry V was eventually recognized in 1420 as heir to the French throne and the regent of France.

But France would go on to eventually win the Hundred Years' War.

A
 trained archer could shoot six aimed arrows a minute which could wound 
at 400 yards, kill at 200 and penetrate armour at 100 yards.

While
 Henry’s decisive victory in the 100 Years War has never been in 
dispute, there have been numerous arguments about the manner in which it
 was achieved.

Some have 
underplayed the effectiveness of the legendary English and Welsh bowmen 
who took part, suggesting that more underhand tactics ensured a British 
victory, which was immortalised by William Shakespeare’s play ‘Henry V’.

In the past, the French have even accused their ‘perfidious’ foes of acting like war criminals by slaughtering hundreds of prisoners, many of them knights from noble Gallic families. 

The narrow field where the battle took place remains remarkably unchanged, and an archery range will be set up across its length.

Marching troops dressed in the armour of the period will move towards the archers in what will undoubtedly be the most ambitious recreation of the battle ever attempted.

The spectacular commemoration will come at a time when France and Belgium are preparing to mark the significant anniversaries of numerous great battles.

These include Waterloo, which took place in 1815, and many of the great actions of World War I, which started in 1914.

Recreations are particularly popular in France, where strict safety procedures are followed to try and stop anyone getting hurt.

Cautionary advice on the Agincourt Alliance website reads: ‘All weapons must be blunted... Axes, maces and flails are not permitted on the battlefield during combat.’
