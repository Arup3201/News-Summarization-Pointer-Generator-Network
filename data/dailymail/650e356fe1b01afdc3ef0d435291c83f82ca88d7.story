The German Medical Association has apologised for the sadistic experiments carried out by Nazi doctors on Jews.

The body has admitted that many doctors under Nazi-rule during the Second World War were guilty of 'scores of human rights violations'.

German doctors performed pseudo-scientific experiments on concentration camp inmates, including at Auschwitz.

They were also  key to the Nazi's program of forced sterilisation or euthanasia of the mentally ill or others deemed 'unworthy of life'.

In a statement made in Nuremberg this week, the German medical association said  'these crimes were not the actions of individual doctors but involved leading members of the medical community'.

The crimes should be taken as a warning for the future, it added.

The doctors were 'guilty, contrary to their mission to heal, of scores of human rights violations and we ask the forgiveness of their victims, living and deceased, and of their descendants'.

Perhaps the most notorious Nazi doctor was Auschwitz medic Josef Mengele.

Known as the 'Angel of Death', he consigned arrivals to the gas chambers and carried out appalling medical experiments on Jews, most of whom died in agony without anaesthetic.

He escaped to Brazil at the end of the war and for decades was the most wanted Nazi war criminal.  He died in 1979 after suffering a stroke while swimming.

Another infamous Nazi doctor was Dr Aribert Heim, the so-called ‘Doctor Death’, who would inject substances such as petrol, water or poison directly into his victims’ hearts.

He would often perform operations without anaesthesia to see how much pain humans could endure.

And in one notorious ‘experiment’ he castrated and decapitated a young athlete, before having the flesh boiled off his skull, to be used as a display piece.

Until 2008, Heim’s actions earned him a place as the most-wanted Nazi war criminal still thought to be at large.

But the 2009 discovery of a battered and rusting briefcase held in storage by the Cairo hotel owner now indicates that the hunt may finally be over.

It contained medical records showing that Heim suffered from rectal cancer, which eventually killed him in 1992.

He is then thought to have been buried in an anonymous grave, although there are some who think the evidence is far from conclusive and that he may still be alive.

Guy Walters, author of Nazi war criminal book Hunting Evil, said: 'Heim is one of the major criminals of the last century.

'His experiments that he carried out on concentration camp victims were disgusting and he was currently being hunted for his crimes.'

Although Heim was captured in a general round-up of leading Nazis by U.S. forces in March 1945, he was released because his name did not appear on any of the lists of war criminals the Allies had quickly drawn up.

He became a gynaecologist in West Germany until 1962, when his past caught up with him in the form of the Austrian police, who were finally investigating him for his war crimes.

Heim was tipped off and he escaped, reportedly to Spain and then to Uruguay, where he opened up a gynaecological practice.

Since the 1960s, Heim had been able to live a relatively unmolested life, and quietly amassed a small fortune.
