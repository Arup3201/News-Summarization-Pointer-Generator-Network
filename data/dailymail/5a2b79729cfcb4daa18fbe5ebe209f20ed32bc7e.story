A Ferrari-driving millionaire was last night being quizzed by police on suspicion of shooting a solicitor in the face with a sawn-off shotgun.

Property developer Michael Chudleigh, 61, was arrested  35 minutes after a gunman walked into the lawyer’s office in the market town of Devizes, Wiltshire.

The victim, father-of-three James Ward, 58 – described as a ‘lovely’ family man who would do anything for anybody – was shot at his desk and left fighting for his life.

Suspect: Michael Chudleigh at his house in Wiltshire in 2007. The 62-year-old has been named locally as the man arrested by police in connection with the shooting of solicitor James Ward in Devizes yesterday

Last night Mr Ward’s wife Nicola 
Morris, who also works at his firm, was keeping a hospital bedside vigil
along with their children.

Police are investigating whether Chudleigh bore a grudge against the solicitor.

It is understood that the tycoon was 
recently evicted when his stunning £2million converted farmhouse in the 
tiny village of Rowde, near Devizes, was repossessed.

The Tudor-style ‘dream home’, 
Kingfisher House, boasts five bedrooms, marble bathrooms, and a 62ft 
heated outdoor swimming pool with a thatched bar.

He lived there with Francine Whale, 
his married business partner, and once explained the arrangement by 
saying he she had initially allowed him to keep his ‘very rare Ferrari’ 
parked there, then he moved in himself.

Neighbours claimed Chudleigh had been 
evicted in April after falling on hard times.One, who asked not want to 
be named, said they had seen armed police swooping on the property.

Four staff members were in Mr Ward’s 
offices on Monday afternoon, when the shooting took place. Two members 
of the public – including an off-duty paramedic – rushed in to try to 
help Mr Ward before he was airlifted to hospital.

Last night police were granted an extra 12 hours to question Chudleigh.

Detective Chief Inspector Ian 
Saunders, from Wiltshire Police, said: ‘This clearly is a very tragic 
incident. The victim is currently at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol with 
life-threatening head injuries.

‘The man who has been arrested was found in the village of Rowde shortly afterwards.

‘He was sitting a short distance away 
from his car. We found him to be in possession of a weapon which we 
believe was the same shotgun used in the attack on Mr Ward.’

Chudleigh is well-known in the area, 
following a 2007  story that revealed how he bought his married lover 
Rachel Leigh a £100,000 Ferrari, a Rolex and jewellery, only to discover
she was secretly also cheating on him with one of his friends.

On discovering the second affair, he stormed round to her home and confronted both her and her taxi driver husband.

The property developer and Francine were tied up by two masked men in October 2009 - when they stormed his home with a shotgun and stole £50,000 worth of jewellery

It is thought Mr Chudleigh was evicted and the property repossessed by the mortgage company in April

Afterwards, Chudleigh said: ‘Rachel 
was the love of my life. I left my former partner Carol for her. I left 
my house for her.

'I left everything for her – but she has left me in 
bits.

‘I even proposed to her in Winchester 
Cathedral and gave her an £8,000 sapphire engagement ring, which was a 
copy of Princess Diana’s engagement ring.

'We had the most amazing sex 
life.’

In an unrelated 2009 incident, 
Chudleigh and his business partner Mrs Whale were tied up by two masked 
men in a shotgun robbery on their home.

The robbers made off with 
£50,000 worth of jewellery.

Speaking after the ordeal, the 
property developer said: ‘We were bound head and foot and they 
threatened to kill me if I did not tell them where the money was.’

Mr Ward set up his family law firm, 
Morris, Goddard and Ward, around 20 years ago. Two of his children are 
believed to be at university with a third working in Madrid.

Mr Chudleigh had a nine year affair with married blonde Rachel Leigh, right, and admitted to romping in woods behind her house while her husband David was at work

A family member said last night: ‘The 
kids are very close to their dad, and he has been married to Nicola for 
over 20 years.

'We are at a loss to understand why anyone would do this 
to him. He is a gentleman – that is the best word to describe him.’

A neighbour at Mr Ward’s large 
red-brick farmhouse in Westbury, Wiltshire, said: ‘He is just such a 
lovely man. The whole family is lovely. It is such a shock this has 
happened – he wouldn’t hurt a fly.’
