Venus Williams and Svetlana Kuznetova were recently treated to canine ball boys during a warm-up match

Billed as the 'best ball boys in the word', the obedient dogs proved to be better than the real thing

Organisers of the ASB Classic in Auckland, New Zealand, livened up a practice match by hiring a rescued bullmastiff named Oscar, a Border Collie named Ted and a Jack Russell/Norfolk Terrier/Miniature Schnauzer cross named Super Teddy to retrieve the balls between volleys.

Wearing cute yellow sweatbands on all four paws, the dogs performed admirably and remained on the ball at all times.

Although a minor mishap at the end of the clips shows Kuznetova wrestling one of the dogs for a towel.

Ball boys beware, you may be out of a job.
