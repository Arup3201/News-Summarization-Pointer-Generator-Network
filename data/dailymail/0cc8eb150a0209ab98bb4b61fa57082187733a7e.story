A patch of land which was once worth $300,000 is set to turn a group of Melbourne family and friends into multi-millionaires.

The 108ha farmland in Sunbury, northwest of Melbourne, was bought in 1982 and was considered 'the middle of nowhere' which has now transformed into a prime housing development site - worth $70 million.

Ten investors, among them five brothers, told Nine News they had to borrow funds to place a deposit on the property as they were destitute at the time.

The 108ha farmland in Sunbury, northwest of Melbourne, was bought in 1982 for $300,000 and is said to be worth $70 million

The ten blocks of land, ranging in size from 6.25ha to 19.59ha, is expected to be rezoned and developed into 2000 properties to create a new suburb - South Sunbury. 

The investors put the property on the market when they realised nearby farmland was being turned into residential areas.

The sale will be divided up among them, based on the size of the blocks each investor owns.

The property has ten investors, five of them brothers who are now set to make a small fortune

The ten blocks of land are expected to be rezoned and developed into 2000 properties to create a new suburb, South Sunbury

They include tradesmen, aged in their sixties and seventies, who say the property sale will help them enjoy their well-earned retirement.

'For me and my wife... we didn't have much holidays, because working hard, now we try to enjoy a little bit more than we did before,' one co-owner told Nine News.

The Croatian immigrants hope to share their earnings with their family and also take trips to their home land.

One of the co-owners said he will give some of the money to his grandchildren, but he and his wife will also visit their homeland in Croatia

Real estate agent Joseph Ngo said the property, which is set to officially hit the market next week, has already generated interest from buyers in China and Sweden

'I got a grandchildren, a little bit for them and a little bit for me too,' said another co-owner.

If the hobby farm is sold for $70 million, current owners will earn about $65 per square metre.

Real estate agent Joseph Ngo said the property, which is set to officially hit the market next week, has already generated interest from buyers in China and Sweden.

'They do have in the pipeline a train station, of course a school, a park,' he said.
