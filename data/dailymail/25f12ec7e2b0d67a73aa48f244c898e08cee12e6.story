World champion glider pilot illuminates the night sky as he performs a one-man fireworks display in this spectacular video.

The 23-year-old daredevil from Dala-Jarna, 180 miles north of Swedish capital Stockholm, took to the sky to delight his home town with his pyrotechnics skills. 

'Most people are already very amazed and say that they have never seen anything like it before,' Gustaffson says, adding it's just a taster of what's to come.

'I'm planning on developing the show and adding even more effects too.'

Gustaffson, the winner of the 2010 and 2013 Advance Aerobatics World Championships, skilfully manoeuvred his neon-covered glider through the night in September last year.

He thrilled the crowd with his £45,000 glider and its seemingly electrified wings as the show's centrepiece.

Johan, who was inspired to take to the skies at the age of 15 by his pilot dad Christer, says no matter how many times he does such a routine it is always a challenge. 

'The hardest part of flying such a routine is to get the timing right,' he says.   

Gustaffson was the Advance Aerobatics World Championships winner in both 2010 and 2013

'You also have to work hard to keep orientation and altitude right to keep yourself off the ground.'

Johan is hoping to take his show global in 2015 with dates planned for Belgium as well as his homeland.
