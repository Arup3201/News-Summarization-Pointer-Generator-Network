Click here to read Jamie Carragher's in-depth chat with Sportsmail's Matt Lawton in which the Liverpool legend claims Arsenal will not be able to win the Premier League title

Jamie Carragher believes Arsene Wenger chooses not to select Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil in a central position because the Frenchman 'doesn't trust' him to play there in big games.

Ozil was criticised for another abject showing as the Gunners were downed by Jose Mourinho's Chelsea on Sunday as Arsene Wenger chose to play the German on the wing once again.

The German's best performance for Arsenal  so far this season came during the 3-0 victory against Aston Villa which saw Ozil play centrally and score his team's first goal of the game.

However, Sportsmail columnist Carragher believes Ozil must do more to justify his £42.5million pricetag.

Carragher tweeted: 'Any Ozil apologists who talk about him playing wide remember he played central last season and was poor.'

The former Liverpool star also responded to a number of replies to his original Ozil tweet as Carragher sparked debate amongst Arsenal fans.

When one fan looked to defend Ozil by claiming he must play centrally, Carragher replied: 'Everyone knows he's better there but last season wasn't good in there. Obvious Wenger doesn't trust him central in big games.'
