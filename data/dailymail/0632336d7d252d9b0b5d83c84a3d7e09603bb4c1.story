Most of us are glad to see the back of the winter season, but this group of Slovenians are keen to give it more of a nudge.

To celebrate the nearing of the end of the cold snap, Slovenians and members of various ethnological groups took to the hills to perfect their moves ahead of the annual carnival, the 'pust,' to 'chase away' winter.

Also known locally as Kurentovanje, locals wear traditional masks and costumes to scare off the winter and are arriving in their masses in various towns in the country to honour the tradition.

The festival will run until February 17 as townsfolk get set to welcome in the spring.

People dress in all sorts of weird and wonderful designs. The main figures, called Kurent or Korent, wear massive sheepskin garments and a chain with huge bells around its waist. 

The Skoromati are known as one of the oldest traditional characters in Slovenia, and they help lead the charge to chase away winter.

Numerous events are staged in the country over an 11-day period, and it is thought over 100,000 people will join in the celebration.

The main parade takes place on Shrove Tuesday (February 17) in Ptuj.

The purpose of such events is to preserve and develop a unique cultural heritage and ethnographic tradition. 

Kurentovanje adds a touch of mysticism, and is one of the most important traditional events in Slovenia and middle Europe.

The first festival was thought to have been on Shrove Tuesday back in 1960. The procession leaders were spearmen followed by ploughmen, a bear, fairies, cockerels, and Kurents, all dancing at the sound of music played by a local band. 

The performance and customs of each traditional mask were explained to the gathered crowd via loud-speakers. 

The event met with tremendous success and aroused general interest which encouraged the organisers to continue.
