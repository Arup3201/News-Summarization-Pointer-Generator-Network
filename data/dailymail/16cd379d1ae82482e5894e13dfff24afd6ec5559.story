The mother of missing toddler Ben 
Needham claims she is being held to 
ransom by a man demanding £500,000 to reveal her son's whereabouts

Ben was just 21-months-old when he disappeared from the island of Kos in July 1991, and there has been no trace of him since despite an international search. 

Kerry Needham revealed yesterday that private investigators in Greece had contacted her through her Facebook page to say a man was offering information but wanted assurances that the original reward of £500,000 her family had offered was still available.

'We then emailed the 
detective agency saying unfortunately the reward was no longer on offer 
and the benefactor who offered the reward had lost contact.

'When the man
was informed of this he said without any money there would be no 
information,' she said.

Ms Needham, 40, has been in constant touch with 
the agency but privacy laws in Greece prevent the agency from revealing his identity.

But he is believed to be a pensioner who lived on Kos at the 
time Ben disappeared.

Ms Needham said: 'Ransoms - there are movies
made out of things like that it doesn’t happen to somebody like me but 
it was happening and it is still happening.

'Why is somebody being allowed to 
blackmail a family like us. We just want to know where Ben is. It felt 
like he was making me put a price on my son’s life.

'What was more important paying him the 
money or not ever finding my son. This man cannot be allowed to just sit
there and play a game with my life.'

Now Angela Smith, Kerry Needham’s 
Sheffield MP is asking the Foreign Office to call on the Greek 
authorities to intervene.

She 
said: 'We are going to ask that he opens up a dialogue with his 
counterpart in Greece because it is clear that it is the Greek police 
that should be investigating this latest claim that someone has 
information about Ben.'

Ben disappeared on the afternoon of July 24, 1991, after his young mother left him with her parents while she went to work at a hotel.

Eddie and Christine Needham took him to a farmhouse belonging to their friend Michaelis Kypreos, where the couple ate lunch as their grandson played outside.

But when they realised Ben had fallen silent, they discovered he was nowhere to be seen and called for a police search team.

Last month Ms Needham dismissed claims that Ben is buried under of 
mound of rubble on the Greek island of Kos.

She was shocked at news that Greek
police are planning to excavate under the rubble close to the farmhouse
where Ben, disappeared in July 1991.

The farmhouse was being renovated by 
her dad Eddie when Ben disappeared.

Reports say that Ben may have wandered into tangled undergrowth and ended up under rubble the builders were dumping there.

But Ms Needham dismissed the idea and said the rubble was already there when the Needham family were staying there.

She has always clung desperately to 
the believe that Ben is still alive and said she hopes he is happy with 
any family who have brought him up.

Ms Needham said: 'My dad was renovating 
the farmhouse. There was some building work going on but it was further 
down the lane from the farmhouse where Ben was .

'The area where they are referring to
is to the left of the property. That mound of rubble and waste was 
already there while Ben was still there .

'I have now go to gather my strength 
and keep fighting. The one thing I don’t want to happen is for the 
British public to think ‘Ok then Ben’s dead and we no longer have to 
search for him’

'I believe Ben is not dead he is still alive and he is well and he is living out there.'
