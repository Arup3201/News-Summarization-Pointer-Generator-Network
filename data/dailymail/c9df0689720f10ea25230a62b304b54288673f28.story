An eight-year-old boy collapsed and died from an unknown illness as he returned home from a small Missouri school.

Bradley Voss, a third-grade student, had complained of a headache before leaving for school on Monday morning, but teachers said he had appeared healthy in class.

When he collapsed on the bus ride home, about half a mile from school, the driver returned to Strain-Japan School and tried to revive him using CPR.

An autopsy on Tuesday morning failed to find a cause for Bradley's sudden death. Authorities must now wait for test results, which could take several weeks to arrive.

He had been given a painkiller by his mother before leaving for school, after he complained of a headache.

'She’d given him some kind of aspirin. Tylenol or something like that,' Franklin County Sheriff Gary Toelke told Fox 2.

He added that Bradley's death was not being treated as suspicious, but said police had returned to the school as part of routine investigations.

The unexpected death has hit the rural school of 70 students hard.

'It’s been a very difficult time, and 
trying to stay as strong as you can for the rest of the students and 
staff here,' principal Anita Studdard said.

Ms Studdard paid tribute to Bradley, saying: 'Always had a smile on his face and 
willing to joke with you ... He was just a great 
student, very caring about others.'

A tribute to Bradley at a funeral home described the eight-year-old as 'a bold boy who spoke his mind'.

He enjoyed outdoor sports including hunting and fishing, and had killed his first deer during a hunting trip with his father, Brian, in the fall.

Dorothy Adams, whose six-year-old son attended the same school, told KSDK: 'He liked the little fella really good and he's seriously upset about it.'

'All the kids and everybody at the school loved him and still do,' she added.
