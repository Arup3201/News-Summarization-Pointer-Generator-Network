Valery Mezague was found dead in his apartment

Former Portsmouth midfielder Valery Mezague has been found dead in his French apartment.

The 30-year-old Cameroon midfielder spent part of the 2004-05 season on loan at Fratton Park from Marseille.

The midfielder made 11 Premier League appearances for Portsmouth during his time on loan, and returned to England in 2013 for a spell with Bury.

Mezague was also part of the Cameroon team that reached the final of the Confederations Cup in 2003, the tournament where Marc-Vivien Foe died after collapsing on the pitch.

His last club Sporting Toulon Var released a statement on Mezague's death.

The statement read: 'It is with great sadness that Sporting Toulon informs you of the death of Valery Mezague.'

The cause of death is unknown, but a Toulon police source told AFP: 'An autopsy will he held on Monday. We do not currently have any suspicions (of criminal activity).'
