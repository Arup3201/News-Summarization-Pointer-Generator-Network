Louis van Gaal has criticised the decision to play a pre-season game against Roma in the afternoon heat of Colorado on Saturday.

It is expected to be 33 degrees in Denver when Manchester United’s game kicks off and the new Old Trafford manager pulled no punches when asked about the prospect.

'You are fully right to ask that,' Van Gaal said. 'It is unbelievable that we play at two o’clock. We will adapt to the situation because all the players will play for 45 minutes except Tom Cleverley, who will have to play the whole match.'

Van Gaal is fully aware of the dangers of playing in extreme heat after seeing his Dutch players toil in the furnace that was Fortaleza against Mexico in this summer’s World Cup.

The 62-year-old insisted on drinks breaks that day and Holland were still able to complete a late comeback to win 2-1.

He added: 'For the players, it is very hard and I hope I can persuade the referee to have a drinks break as I did in Fortaleza.

'We have sports science department and it shall be done very well with the conditions, especially those players who will play 45 minutes. Maybe it will be different for Tom, though.'

Van Gaal lost right-back Rafael to a groin injury in training on Friday. He said: 'It seems like that, but we will have to wait and see how he is. We know already, though, that he cannot play on Saturday.'
