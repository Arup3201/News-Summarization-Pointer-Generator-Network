Comedian Jimbo Bazoobi has been travelling around Australia for three years with his best mate Gary.

Gary sits up the front of Mr Bazoobi's truck as they drive around the outback and watches him perform in pubs around the country.

And while on paper it sounds like a normal friendship there's one catch: Gary is actually a goat.

Gary has had an online following ever since a bizarre incident in August 2012 which saw a police officer try to fine Mr Bazoobi because Gary ate flowers out of a garden bed near the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney.

But recently Gary's popularity has skyrocketed. In February the 'Gary the Goat' fan page on Facebook had 20,000 likes – now it's got more than 715,000.

Mr Bazoobi, 44, puts it down to the videos of Gary he's been posting on the page for the past few months.

'It just hit off when I started putting videos up,' he told the Daily Mail Australia from Mataranka in the Northern Territory, about 420km southeast of Darwin.

'I think they can actually see his personality… They just go "S*** this is a cool goat."

'They can see I've not just cut and paste pictures of goats or whatever.'

He recently purchased a GoPro camera, which he has nicknamed the GoatPro

His and Gary's videos have also been improved by the purchase of a GoPro camera, which he has nicknamed the GoatPro.

'I got it about two months ago but it took me about two months to learn how to use it,' he said.

'I try to do a video each day, all I do is follow Gary around and he kind of writes the script.'

Mr Bazoobi is from Sydney but he has been travelling around Australia doing stand-up comedy for the past 10 years.

He acquired Gary for a case of beer in Western Australia three years ago and the pair have been inseparable ever since.

Mr Bazoobi and Gary have spent the majority of their time together travelling around Western Australia, and have also been to New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland.

Mr Bazoobi said his favourite thing about Gary is his sense of adventure

Gary made headlines in Sydney in January last year when he appeared in the Downing Centre Local court over the incident outside the Museum of Contemporary Art.

'A couple of years ago he got a bit of attention for that, he was kind of like the wacky news story for the day,' Mr Bazoobi said.

'It was a fun day taking a goat to court.'

The magistrate dismissed the case.

'I've always treated him as my mate and he is,' he said.

'He just understands a lot more than I ever imagined.

'He's just a relaxed, inquisitive goat who likes to do different things.'

Mr Bazoobi said his favourite thing about Gary is his sense of adventure.

'I lead him around half the time and he leads me around half the time and we just see where we end up,' he said.

'He gets a bit bored when I don't do things with him every day.'

Gary receives a mixed reaction from members of the public, but as his online popularity grows it's getting more positive.

'Out in the bush they don't care as much, they basically just laugh I think,' Mr Bazoobi said.

'But a guy yesterday wanted to shoot him because he was eating his bush.'

Mr Bazoobi added that he would never sell Gary.

Mr Bazoobi will travel to Western Australia after he finishes road tripping around the Northern Territory and he has no plans to stop any time soon

'I've had a few offers and stuff but as if I'm going to get rid of Gary, he's my mate.'

Mr Bazoobi said he thinks people respond well to his and Gary's adventures because he is 'uncensored'.

'A lot of stuff is censored on TV, and just from 10 years of travelling around I'm really just talking the way people talk to their friends,' he said.

'I've got no producer or director or anyone telling me what to do so that helps.

'It's not like I'm waiting on someone to give me a second series, it's just a Facebook page.'

Mr Bazoobi will travel back to WA after he finishes road tripping around the Northern Territory and he has no plans to stop any time soon.

'We're just going to keep going,' he said.

'I'm just glad he's only four years old so I've got another 11 years with him.'
