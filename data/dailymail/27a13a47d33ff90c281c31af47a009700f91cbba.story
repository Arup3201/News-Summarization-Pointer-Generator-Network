A huge blast has ripped through an Iranian explosives factory linked to to the country's controversial nuclear programme - killing two workers and shattering windows nine miles away. 

The incident took place at Iran's Parchin military site, which is located around 19 miles southeast of the capital Tehran, the official IRNA news agency reported today. 

The pro-reform website, Sahamnews, said the explosion yesterday evening was so intense that the glare from the blast could be seen from miles away.

The site of the explosion, Parchin military base, is situated 19 miles southeast of Tehran. The UN's nuclear watchdog has long suspected that the complex was used in the development of a nuclear weapons capability

The semi-official Iranian Students News Agency (Isna) said the fire was in an 'explosive materials production unit'.  

They quoted Iran's defence industries organisation, saying: 'Unfortunately, due to the incident, two workers of this production unit lost their lives.' 

The U.N. nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, believe Iran carried out explosives tests at Parchin around a decade ago that could be related to an attempt to develop a nuclear weapons capability. 

Iran has been refusing the agency access to the complex since 2005.

Officials now fear that the Iranian government is seeking to cleanse the compound of evidence. 

But Tehran says Parchin is a conventional military facility and
that its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful. It has often
accused its enemies of seeking to sabotage its atomic
activities.

Israel and the US have not ruled out military
action against Iran if diplomacy fails to resolve a decade-old
dispute over Tehran's nuclear programme.  

But Iran is currently in negotiations with six world powers on a permanent agreement over its nuclear industry. 

Talks are focused on lifting Western sanctions in exchange for a scaling-back of Iran's uranium enrichment programme, and a deadline for the agreement has been set for November 24.

Three years ago, Iran announced that a massive explosion at a military
base 28 miles west of Tehran had killed 17 Revolutionary
Guards, including the head of the elite force's missile
programme. 

It said the blast was caused by an accident while
weapons were being moved.
