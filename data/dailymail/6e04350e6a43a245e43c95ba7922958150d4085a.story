Parts of northern Britain today woke up to more snow outside after another dusting overnight, with up to four inches settling across the high mountains.

Overnight the cities of Glasgow and Edinburgh saw up to two inches of snowfall, with almost the same amount arriving in Teesside and County Durham.

Temperatures for the rest of the week across the country are expected to reach 6C (43F) during the day, but plunge to as low as -4C (25F) overnight.

Insurance payouts following severe flooding in Britain that damaged 1,800 households could total £100million, it was reported last night.

Areas in Somerset and County Durham have been hit hard by the flooding, and rural insurer NFU Mutual expects to pay out £20million.

The Association of British Insurers said its firms are preparing for a £100million payout to cover damaged homes and replace possessions.

An ABI spokesman told the Daily Mirror: 'Those left with homes that are uninhabitable or really badly damaged are being given top priority.'

A four-inch covering decorated

Lincolnshire and Yorkshire escaped the snowfall.

They
 were greeted with rainfall and very cold temperatures instead, with the
 showers hitting sub-zero road surfaces - causing icy conditions for 
drivers.

More
 cold weather is likely to bring fresh misery to those battling to 
recover from the recent floods and to commuters making their way into 
work.

Met Office spokesman 
Helen Chivers said we are looking at a ‘changeable week’ and much of the
 wind is going to be blowing from the North West.

She told MailOnline: ‘The next couple 
of days will see a mixture of sunshine and showers, which could fall as 
sleet and snow on higher parts of Britain.

‘Tuesday night into Wednesday, showers
will become confined to eastern coastal counties. Then most places will
be fine and dry like last week.

‘Milder air will be pushing in from the West on Thursday, and there could be snow over high ground.

‘For the first half of the week we 
will be looking of temperatures of 4C (39F) to 6C (43F). But by Thursday
we may have a sharp frost around.’

The Met Office yesterday issued a 
low-level severe weather warning for the North and East of England and 
northern parts of Wales.

It has removed this as temperatures 
steadily rise and the risk of cold and ice reduces, but councils have 
stockpiled 1.3million tons of road salt.

They also have ‘hundreds’ of gritters 
on standby in an effort to keep transport networks moving, the Local 
Government Association said yesterday.

Those heading in and out of London 
yesterday on the road on rail networks faced delays after signal 
failures and extreme weather.
