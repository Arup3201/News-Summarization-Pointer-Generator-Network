A two-month-old baby boy drowned after his mother suffered an epileptic fit while giving him bath.

Tragic Luis Wilmott-Diaz, from Poynton, Cheshire, was discovered face down in a baby bath with his mother Julianna Willmott in a 'confused and disorientated' state by his side.

Ms Willmott has no recollection of the event until waking up at Stepping Hill Hospital and discovering her baby son had died.

Tragedy: The baby's mother Julianna Willmott woke up in Stepping Hill hospital to be told her boy had died

Speaking at an inquest at Macclesfield Town Hall on Monday, Ms Wilmott, who is originally from Bulgaria, said they were preparing to go to baby yoga.

She said: 'I remember taking him to the bathroom and washing his hair. I remember nothing after that. All I remember is being woken up and told I was at Stepping Hill Hospital.'

Mum-of-three Julianna, who is aged in her later thirties or early forties, suffers from a form of epilepsy which usually manifests itself in the form of ‘jerks’.

She said: 'I was the happiest I’ve ever been in my life.

'I do not understand why something like this could happen. It’s beyond comprehension, it’s inconceivable.

'For the life of me I can’t understand how there was nothing wrong with me one minute and the next minute I’m totally out of it.'

The inquest heard that Luis, born on June 1, 2011, died at Stepping Hill Hospital where he was taken by ambulance after being discoveredby family friend Penelope Guest.

Mrs Guest, also of Poynton, said: 'I opened the door and heard what I thought was a baby crying or a wail - indescribable noises coming from upstairs.

'I found (Ms Wilmott) on the bathroom floor, it was in total disarray. I looked at Julianna and tried to get some sense out of her. She was sat on the floor rocking and her eyes were rolling back into her head.

'I looked over the side of the bath and saw the baby lying face down.'

Dr Anna Richardson, consultant neurologist, said it is likely Julianna suffered an unusually severe epileptic fit, which could have beenaggravated by changes in hormones and medication.

She said: 'I think it would be very much in keeping that the behavioural disturbance and subsequent amnesia was due to a prolonged seizure.'

Matthew Lyall, forensic pathologist, confirmed drowning was the most likely cause of death in the absence of any other medical evidence.

He said: 'Immersion is a reasonable explanation. The fact that the baby was in water is why he has died. How he’s ended up there I can’tsay.'

Police officer DS Janet Moor ruled out any criminal activity following an extensive police investigation, and evidence was heard from MsWilmott’s brother Angel Tetrador, friend Susan Marshall, paramedic Graham Harrington and GP Emma Ward.

Recording a verdict of death by misadventure, Dr Janet Napier, deputy coroner for Cheshire, said: 'This is an extremely tragic case. Thiswas a very much loved and cherished baby.

'There’s been an extensive police investigation because the only witness in the event was unable to remember anything.

We’ve heard the evidence of the neurologist and neuropsychologist and both of them are of the opinion that more likely than not, Julianna suffered an epileptic form of attack at the time which lead to these particularly tragic circumstances.'

The family declined to comment.
