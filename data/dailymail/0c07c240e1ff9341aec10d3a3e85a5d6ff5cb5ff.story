The woman behind the looks that have captivated the world in Beyonce’s latest string of videos has opened up about working with Queen Bey and the tricks she uses to keep Mrs Carter looking on top form.

Makeup artist Francesca Tolot, a legend in the industry, met Beyonce in 2003 when she created that sexy 'wet look' for her smash hit Crazy In Love. Since then the two have been near-inseparable professionally.

Speaking to Into The Gloss,
 Francesca has nothing but praise for the singer, and says that, despite the 
her monumental fame, there was no awkwardness when they met.

Filming 'Partition' for her new album: Francesca says the pair worked closely together to create the looks for each video

The secret to Beyonce's dewy, glowing skin? It's down to baby oil, says her makeup artist

‘She was very nice; she's a very approachable and warm person. We hit it off from the beginning. Right away I felt very comfortable, and very appreciated, too, because she loved everything we did.’

Francesco reveals that the key to Mrs Carter's incredible glow on stage and camera is in fact just good old baby oil - a huge plus for those who don't have a Beyonce-sized makeup budget.

Francesca says the two work closely together to create her looks - opting for a much more pared-down, natural look for many of the videos for her new album.

Francesca and Beyonce have worked together for over 10 years, creating some of her most iconic looks and seeing her rise to super stardom

Her hardest task while working for the star was making her look unattractive for a scene in her film Cadillac Records in which she strared as Etta James (pictured)

Beyonce's natural beauty means she doesn't need that much make-up, says Francesca

She says: 'There isn't really a look she doesn’t like. She’s very smart—whatever we do is her project. It’s her.

'We stopped using lashes quite a few years ago, except for that look in the "Blow" video, when we went for a really ‘70s look. At one point I brought up the fact that I feel that false eyelashes are dated, unless you're going for the retro look. So I talked to her about that, and she totally agreed.’

Gushing about the star, who Francesca travels the world with, she says that Beyonce’s natural beauty means she actually requires very little make-up, and the hardest look she has ever created was making her ugly.

‘Believe it or not, one of the hardest looks to do was for Cadillac Records when she looked so distressed. Can you imagine- somebody with perfect skin, beautiful almond-shaped eyes, very luminous and happy and full of joy—to make her look so bad?’
