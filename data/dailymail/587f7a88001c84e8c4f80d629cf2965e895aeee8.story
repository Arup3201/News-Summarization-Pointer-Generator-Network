Ever get the feeling your face shape is ruining all your relationships? It might just be.

Whether you have a pointy chin, round cheeks, a sharp jawbone or a soft brow could lead men of a certain persuasion to be falling for you.

Men looking for a bit of a fling tend to go for women with delicate, feminine features... while those after something serious often go for more masculine women, according to a new study.

Men choose women with feminine features for flings, and those with more masculine features for long-term relationships, according to the study

Several hundred 
heterosexual male volunteers were shown a selection of faces made up of 
composite parts, and researchers asked the men which they would choose 
for a short relationship, and which for a longer one

It even seems that when making long-term choices, men are likelier to plump for less attractive women.

As reported in CTV News, men are subconsciously driven towards less attractive women because - as has been found in previous studies - they are less likely to be unfaithful.

'If his partner cheats on him, a man risks raising a child which is not his own,' explained study authors Anthony Little from
 the University of Stirling and Benedict Jones from the University of 
Glasgow, in the British Journal of Psychology.

For the study, several hundred heterosexual male volunteers were shown a selection of faces made up of composite parts, and researchers asked the men which they would choose for a short relationship, and which for a longer one.

The results echo studies in how women choose mates: in these studies females similarly prefer chiselled, robust men for a fling and softer, less testosterone-packed ones with which to settle down

There were two versions of each face - 
one slightly more feminine, the other more masculine.

They found that men rated women with more feminine features more highly for a fling, particularly if the man was already in a relationship.

The more masculine and less attractive women higher as wives.

The results echo studies in how women choose mates: in these studies females similarly prefer chiselled, robust men for a fling and softer, less testosterone-packed ones with which to settle down, - possibly as they are considered more reliable for raising children.
