Billionaire R Allen Stanford wasted tens of millions of dollars developing property and businesses on the Caribbean island of Antigua, according to a former employee.

The financier spared no expense on projects including a private airport hangar, cricket grounds, an athletic club, two airlines and a dock facility for his boat, his fraud trial heard yesterday.

Arnold Knoche, who worked for 16 years at Stanford's real estate development company, told the hearing in Houston, Texas, that Stanford was so extravagant he even replaced the hardwood floors at his bank because they weren't the right colour.

Extravagant: Allen Stanford, pictured at a hearing last month, wasted tens of millions of dollars developing property and businesses on Antigua, according to a former employee

Stanford is accused of masterminding a
fraud in which he bilked investors out of more than $7billion in a 
massive Ponzi scheme centred on the sales of certificates of deposit 
from his bank in Antigua.

Authorities
allege he used depositors' money to fund his businesses, many of which 
failed, as well as his lavish billionaire lifestyle.

Stanford's attorneys contend the financier was a savvy businessman whose financial empire was legitimate.

They
have suggested James Davis, the ex-chief financial officer for the 
financier's company, is the real culprit behind the fraud.

Davis has pleaded guilty in the case and is expected to be called by prosecutors this week.

Mr
Knoche said Stanford was partial to granite and marble finishes and 
that one time the financier replaced the hardwood floors in his bank in 
Antigua because he thought 'they were too light a shade' as he had 
wanted all of his buildings in Antigua to have the same colour hardwood 
floors.

The former employee said: 'He was very upset. He said, "This shouldn't have happened."'

Mr
Knoche, who eventually became president of Stanford's real estate 
development company, said he grew concerned about where the money came 
from for these construction projects, which were very expensive because 
they were built quickly and most of the materials for them had to be 
brought from outside the island.

He said he stopped asking Stanford about the source of the money because he 'refused to provide information'.

'It seemed there had to be some limit to how much money he had,' Mr Knoche said.

But
when questioned by Robert Scardino, one of Stanford's attorneys, Mr 
Knoche said any concerns he had about the source of Stanford's funding 
did not prompt him to quit.

He said he left Stanford's company in 2003 because he was travelling too much for work.

'What he built there improved the island considerably?' Scardino asked. 'Yes,' Mr Knoche responded.

In
a video shown to jurors, Stanford could be seen talking to staffers 
about how he was willing to 'spend millions and millions of dollars' to 
develop Antigua so he could create an environment that would 'literally 
blow away' potential investors his company flew on corporate jets to the
island nation.

Stanford
said in the video: 'We are growing our business with high net worth 
people and high net worth people are not easily impressed.'

Prosecutors did not say when the video was filmed.

Stanford is on trial for 14 counts, including mail and wire fraud, and faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.

He
was once considered one of the wealthiest people in the U.S., with an 
estimated net worth of more than $2billion. He has been in jail without 
bond since being indicted in 2009.

The trial continues.
