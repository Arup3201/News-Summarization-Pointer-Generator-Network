She gives directions to over 100 million people in GPS devices around the world and has become the Australian voice of Apple's knowledge navigator Siri.

But singer Karen Jacobsen, from Queensland, had no idea that her voice was going to be used for the high-profile role - and that she would become known as 'Australian Karen' - when she recorded 50 hours worth of directions in a studio in America, in 2002.

It wasn't until a surprising phone call in 2004, from a friend who was using GPS to drive back to New York from Maine at Christmas, that she found out just how well known her own voice had become.

And despite now being known recognised all over the world as Apple's Australian Siri, Karen told Daily Mail Australia she was 'the last person to own an iPhone'.

From the age of seven, growing up in Mackay, a city on the eastern coast of Queensland, Karen had dreams of making it in the Big Apple.

She watched her blonde-haired Australian icon Olivia Newton-John on TV in America, saw how successful she was, and thought: 'I want to be a singer and move to America.'

Karen, who played the lead in her school shows growing up in Mackay, told her parents and 'everyone who would listen' of her ambitious plans.

'Some of them said "she'll grow out of it"... but I was very clear all along that my life was going to be about music,' she said, speaking from the place she now calls home - Manhattan, New York.

'My parents were so supportive... all those years of piano lessons,' she added.

After spending her childhood in Mackay, Karen moved to Brisbane to study music at Queensland Conservatorium Griffith University.

Next she moved to Sydney, where she worked in the piano bars of five star hotels and made her musical theatre debut in the original Australian cast of Buddy – The Buddy Holly Story.

After ten years working in Sydney, she said: 'You couldn't turn the TV on in the 1990s without hearing my voice on the TV or radio in Australia.'

But Karen was still harbouring her big dream - to move to America.

She decided to finally up sticks to the Big Apple when she noticed a lot of people close to her 'were making big plans in their life'.

Her sister was having a baby and her parents were planning their retirement.

'I wasn't sure how to start again, I was doing very well in Sydney... but I felt it was time I followed what I really wanted to do.'

Karen boarded the plane with one suitcase and 'big dreams'.

'Sometimes now I think "what was I thinking?"... I didn't have that persepctive at the time... I sold everything and told everyone I was going, they said I was "crazy".

'I knew a handful of people in New York. Some very dear friends let me sleep on their sofa bed in Union Square for a month before I found my own place... in the first year there were the highest highs and the lowest lows.'

It was two years before Karen got the audition for the lucrative role. She refuses to say how much her big break earned her but did say: 'They were two long years before that came along in 2002.'

When Karen pitched up for the audition all she knew was it was for a 'text-speech system'.

She recorded 50 hours of instructions, with her time in the studio being broken up into four hours a day over three weeks so that her voice didn't get tired.

'I'd record from 9-1pm, have lunch and go back to the hotel and write songs,' she said.

It wasn't until a couple of years later, in 2004, that she found out what the recordings were being used for, during a surprising phone call from a friend.

'I was back in Australia for Christmas and a friend called me and left me a voicemail message saying "my husband and I are driving back to Maine and we turned the Australian voice on our GPS on - and it was you, you directed us back to New York".'

Karen admitted she didn't even know what a GPS was in 2004, let alone how her voice had been used for it.

'I've been asked to speak at events about women in technology - but I am literally just a woman in technology not someone that knows loads about it.

'I was the last person in the world to get an iPhone,' she laughed.

Karen's voice is now used on software systems including the 'intelligent personal assistant' Siri on Apple devices and GPS navigation system Tom Tom, Garmin and Navman.

Her friend isn't the only person who has recognised her voice, now she is often stopped in the street by strangers.

'When it first started happening it was really a bit bizarre and I thought it was a once off,' she told the ABC.

'But I have to say just about every time I meet someone there is that level of familiarity, like I'm a member of their family or someone close to them. It's always stories about how we got lost and the time we recalculated.'

It's not often Karen and her family use GPS navigation themselves - as they live in Manhattan in New York, where cars aren't a necessity - but she says when they go on holiday she does have to listen to instructions from herself.  

And while on holiday in Hawaii with her husband and her six-year-old son Hayden, Hayden heard her voice on the directions and repeated all the lines, adding 'daddy' on the end.

Karen met her husband in New York, through a friend in the music industry. They are set to celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary in just a couple of weeks and she admits that after lots of hard work, everything has come together for her after moving to the Big Apple.

'When you take a really big risk, when you follow what it is you know is right for yourself, you can't go wrong,' she said.
