Mollie King shot to fame as one fifth of girlband The Saturdays but the singer, who is known and loved for her 'sloaney style', has been quietly carving out a successful career for herself in fashion.

The 26-year-old unveiled an edit for Oasis last year and after a stellar success, the high street store have invited Mollie back to select her favourite picks for SS14.

The Loved by Mollie edit was unveiled last night at an intimate dinner with the star at the Boundary Rooftop in Shoreditch and FEMAIL can reveal a sneak peek of what's to come.

She's back! Mollie King, who found fame with The Saturdays, has hand-picked a SS14 edit of designs for Oasis (shorts, £32)

Speaking about the new range, which includes chic co-ords, summery dresses and classic Breton tees, Mollie told MailOnline: 'Oasis told me to pick things that I would wear, which was amazing and means I love every piece.

'I wanted to select outfits that could be worn from day to night and they're just things I would wear myself and can't wait to rock in the coming weeks.

Loved by Mollie: The new offering features denim dresses, Breton striped tees and leathers - all of which Mollie says she would wear herself (denim dress £45, geometric print heels, £45)

'I've been working on it for such a long time that I can't wait for my fans to see it.'

The 30-piece range also offers on-trend denim dresses, Burberry-esque lace co-ords and sophisticated pencil skirts.

A spokesperson for Oasis said: 'Following an incredible customer reaction to our first Loved by Mollie collection, Oasis is thrilled to be collaborating with Mollie once again.

'Oasis and Mollie is a perfect meeting of minds and her proven style know-how creates a great brand match.'

Fashion face: Mollie is craving a career in fashion and is often spotted on the front row of shows and at high fashion parties (blue leather top, £80, , stripe skirt, £45, black block heels, £45)

Honoured: Mollie says she feels really lucky to have worked with Oasis and get a taste of the fashion world - she even has her sights set on her own range one day (cream pom pom top, £35, botanical floral shorts, £35)

The singer has clearly 
enjoyed her foray into the fashion world revealing that she has hopes of
 designing her own range one day.

The star, who was recently signed by Next Model Management, said: 'I would like to design, yes. Hopefully in the future.

'Working with Oasis has been the perfect introduction into the fashion designing world, so much goes into it and I've been really lucky to see it first-hand.

'However my priorities for this year are with the band and with Oasis.'

Nautical: The new range combines her love of summer and feminine dresses with on-trend stripes (dress, £45)
