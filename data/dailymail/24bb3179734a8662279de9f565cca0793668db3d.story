It is the fairytale ball little girls the world over would dream of.

But for these Brazilian 15-year-olds, the debutante dance is particularly special.

They were brought up in Rio de Janeiro's Cerro-Cora 'favela' slum, a world away from the upper-middle-classes that have the money to spend a fortune on their child's 'coming out'.

A dream come true: This is one of the 13 girls from Rio de Janeiro's Cerro-Cora slum  that got to take part in a specially-funded debutante ball

Ecstastic: Coming of age parties are normally reserved for the upper tiers of society but the district police organized one for these girls

A community effort: The dresses were loaned by a clothing store and they were made up by volunteers, with police choreographing the event

Cheers! An officer pours drinks for the delighted 15-year-olds who celebrated their transition from childhood to adulthood in style

Party time: One girl, Marceli Rosa, waves out the roof of their loaned pink limo to crowds of photographers capturing the special moment

However, in a bid to reconquer the district from drug-dealing gangs, the Pacifying Police Unit has funded a ball especially for the poorest young ladies of society.

Smiling ear-to-ear, and glistening head-to-toe, the 13 girls were made up by volunteers and their dresses were loaned by a formal wear shop.

The police unit along with some teachers and parents then helped them to practice the ceremony before the big night on October 31.

A tradition across the continent: Many Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America celebrate the landmark in a party called Quinceañera (15th)

Final touches: The girls glistened from head-to-toe in tiaras, jewelry and jeweled gowns as they prepared to have their first dance in the castle

A celebration: The event was designed as a celebration to reconquer the district from drug-dealing gangs which have prevailed in the slums

They drove through the city on a pink limousine, also loaned to the group.

Each one was escorted into the Ilha Fiscal castle on the arm of an officer after toasting their transition from childhood to adulthood.

The neo-Gothic castle on the Guanabara Bay was inaugurated in 1889 and is famed for holding the last Imperial Ball in November of 1889, just six days before Brazil became a Republic. 

Suited and booted: The dapper police officers stood ready and waiting to take the girls into the Ilha Fiscal castle on the Guanabara Bay

First dance: After being escorted in on an officer's arm, each girl danced hand-in-hand with their suitor under the starry skies 

A picture of beauty: They lined up outside the neo-Gothic castle for pictures to capture the moment their parents could never have imagined

Getting back to the party: The soiree lasted late into the night as the girls got the most out of the bespoke, glimmering dresses

Over the moon: This 15-year-old looks delighted as she darts back into the dance hall to savor the night on Thursday

The party got going: Brothers, friends, and fathers were then allowed to flock onto the dance floor to treat the girls to a dance
