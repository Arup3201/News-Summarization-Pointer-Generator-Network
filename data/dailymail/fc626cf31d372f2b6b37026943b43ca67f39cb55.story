A patient at a Cincinnati, Ohio, hospital is accused of threatening nurses with a gun before police discovered he had an entire duffel bag full of firearms and other weapons stashed near his bed.

The suspect, who remained hospitalized at Bethesda North Hospital on Tuesday, allegedly pulled the gun on the medical staff just before 8:30 p.m on Thursday, October 10. after they refused to discharge him.

He has been charged with aggravated assault, intimidation and a weapons law violation.

According to authorities, five officers 
rushed to the hospital's entrance after receiving a report of a patient 
threatening the staff with a gun.

When they arrived, officers found the patient was carrying more than a single weapon.

They then discovered a bag holding two .22 caliber pistols, a .38 caliber pistol, .38 ammo, .22 ammo and a holster and belt for the .38 caliber pistol, scissors, nail clippers and a copy of American Rifleman magazine.

They also found a bear spray deterrent on the patient.

Montgomery police have released little information on what happened on October 10.

No one was hurt in the incident.

'It was a very unfortunate incident and 
luckily no one was injured,' spokesman Joe Kelley said Tuesday, adding 
that the TriHealth system considers the safety of patients, staff and 
visitors 'paramount.'

According to WLWT, the man pulled the gun on the nurse after he was denied a discharge.

Security agents managed to get him to put down the gun without anyone getting hurt.

Bethesda North does not have metal detectors nor do workers search patients' belongings upon admittance.

A spokesman for hospital-owner TriHealth said privacy laws prevented him from discussing the patient.

The Hamilton County Prosecutor's Office is investigating the case.
