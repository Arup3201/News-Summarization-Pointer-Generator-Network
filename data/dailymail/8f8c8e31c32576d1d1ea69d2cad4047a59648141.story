Australia could be forced to put troops on the ground in Syria if it wants to defeat the Islamic State, Australia's defence chief has said in a chilling warning.

Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin, believes that the terrorist organisation will at some point have to be defeated 'on the battlefield', Fairfax Media reports.

He said the Islamic State, an offshoot of al-Qaeda which is fighting in Syria and Iraq, is 'not undefeatable'.

Air Marshal Binskin also reportedly said the situation is 'bigger than Iraq'.

The news comes as The New York Times reported on Wednesday that Australia may support a potential US military mission to bomb ISIS targets in Syria.

An official reportedly told the paper that President Barack Obama wants to expand the campaign against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.

In a speech to the American Legion in North Carolina, Mr Obama said: 'Rooting out a cancer like ISIL won't be easy, and it won't be quick.'

Australia, Britain, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates are all thought to be allies that the US will try and enlist for the mission.

The Australian government has already compiled a dossier of the atrocities committed by ISIS against civilians across Syria and Iraq, News Corp reports.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced the government will pour $64 million into measures to 'counter violent extremism and radicalisation'

An estimated 60 Australians are currently believed to be fighting with extremists in Syria and Iraq. The government believes there are a further 100 'facilitators' in Australia.

This week Mr Abbott announced the government would pour $64 million into measures to 'counter violent extremism and radicalisation'.

And on Thursday it emerged anti-terror officers have arrested a suspected terrorist bound for Syria at Melbourne Airport after he was allegedly found carrying images of beheadings and the ISIL flag.

The man, who is an Australian citizen, was allegedly also carrying $30,000 and was with three family members when he was detained on a flight travelling to Beirut, Lebanon on Monday, the Herald Sun reported.

This comes after another man was arrested at Sydney Airport on Sunday after material related to the Islamic State was found in his luggage.
