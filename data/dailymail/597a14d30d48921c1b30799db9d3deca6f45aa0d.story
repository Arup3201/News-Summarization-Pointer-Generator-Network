Russian president Vladimir Putin has got in touch with his cuddly side as he prepares to host the Winter Olympics in Sochi.

Putin - known for being a tough, rugged outdoorsman - visited a preserve for endangered Persian leopards at Sochi National Park today.

He visited a group of cubs born last summer - one of which he lifted onto his lap and stroked.

'We've decided to restore the population of the Persian leopard because of the Olympic Games,' said Putin.

'Let's say that because of the Olympic Games, we have restored parts of the destroyed nature.'

During his trip, Putin entered one of the leopard's cages and stroked the animal on the back of the head - before declaring: 'We like each other'.

However, the president did not feel the same about the local media, who apparently upset the big cat, which scratched one of them on the hand and bit another on the knee, according to Russian news agencies.

Putin's first step on the Olympic stage was designed as a show of environmental consciousness ahead of the Sochi Games, which open on Friday.

The leopard preserve was established at the park, situated between seaside Sochi and the Alpine venues in the towering Caucasus Mountains, five years ago as an Olympics-related project. 

Some of the new leopard population is to be released next year in hopes of repopulating southern Russia, where they became extinct in the 1970. 

The former KGB operative has thrown open the Kremlin treasury to finance the Olympics, lavishing a record $51 billion on sports facilities and transportation infrastructure in the resort city on the Black Sea coast.

He has gambled big on the games, determined to host an event in a fashion befitting his image of a newly powerful Russia that is a global economic and political power. 

Putin drove to the reserve in an SUV, with two International Olympic Committee (IOC) officials riding in the back seat. Later today, the Russian leader was due in Sochi to address the IOC. 

With the vast sum Putin invested in the Games, he has turned the once-sleepy resort into a kind of Disneyland of phantasmagorical structures - new highways, sweeping overpasses and top-notch sports venues.

Winding roads and rail lines were cut upward into the mountains to newly built Alpine facilities.

While the massive project doesn't represent a do-or-die moment for Russia, the most expensive Olympics in history - with billions of dollars reportedly lost to graft - will still reverberate through the economy and Kremlin politics.

Putin's third term as president will end in 2018.

What's more, the games are being shunned by President Barack Obama and key European leaders.

The U.S. leader, in open protest of new Russian anti-gay laws, dispatched an official American delegation made up of three openly gay athletic greats - former tennis star Billie Jean King, 2006 Olympic hockey medalist Caitlin Cahow and figure skating wizard Brian Boitano.

Former Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano leads the delegation. 

Top officials from Olympic heavyweights, including Britain, France and Germany, also won't be in Sochi.

The paucity of national leaders of major world powers leaves Putin with a schedule of meetings that will begin on Thursday with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

On the following day, he will sit down with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Japanese leader Shinzo Abe. No Western-aimed diplomacy is scheduled. 

While Putin stepped in in Syria to convince leader Bashar Assad to turn over his chemical weapons - therefore saving Obama from having to initiate airstrikes - the White House remains angry that Russia have given asylum to Edward Snowden, the contract worker who has leaked volumes of secrets about U.S. intelligence-gathering efforts.
