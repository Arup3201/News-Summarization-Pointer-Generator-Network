Martin Odegaard is set to make his Real Madrid debut this week despite being taken off at half-time while playing for the reserves on Saturday.

The 16-year-old struggled to show off his skills on a rain-sodden pitch as Real Madrid Castilla were held to a 1-1 draw at Amorebieta.

Odegaard is expected to be named in the match-day squad for Wednesday's Champions League round of 16 tie tie against Shalke in Germany.

And should the Norway international be called upon by Carlo Ancelotti he would become the youngest player ever to appear in the competition. 

Odegaard has been training first-team squad since he was named in Real Madrid's Champions League squad. 

A Spanish publication also reported that the men’s clothing brand, TenKey, recently measured Odegaard for his official travel suit.
