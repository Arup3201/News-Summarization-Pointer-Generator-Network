A single dad who stumbled upon some Google searches suggesting his son is gay took to reddit for advice on how subtly coax the news out of the 13-year-old.

The redditor, who goes by the screen name HeMeYou, posted his touching query earlier this month and the story-- and how it touchingly played out -- has since gone viral.

The original post began: 'I'm 38, and a single dad to my 13 year old son...the other day I asked my son if I could borrow his iPad...I noticed that he forgot to delete his history as a lot of the search terms were along the lines of "I'm gay what now?" etc...'

'I love him regardless of which gender he loves': A single dad who stumbled upon some Google searches suggesting his son is gay took to reddit for advice on how subtly coax the news out of the 13-year-old

Viral: The response from redditors was fast and emphatic. The father soon had a trove of helpful hints and his son soon felt comfortable enough to come out

HeMeYou wanted to know how to proceed with his son to make sure the boy understood 'I love him regardless of which gender he loves.'

The response from fellow redditors was swift.

'Google "how to tell my son I will love and support him no matter what" and leave it in his search history. :)' said the top commenter.

Others told their own stories of coming out and how their fathers dealt with the subject. Still others urged HeMeYou to find subtle ways to let his son know he's supportive.

Armed with hundreds of helpful hints, HeMeYou began his campaign to empower his son to come out to him.

'I started off with talking about general media with him, for instance I mentioned how awesome it was that Tim Cook came out,' he wrote.

Then, after picking him up from school soon after, HeMeYou asked his son if he has any school crushes.

'So who is the lucky person,' asked HeMeYou, being careful not to specify any gender.

The dad said his son seemed taken aback that his father wasn't asking about 'girlfriends,' specifically.

'Well, whoever it is, they should be so lucky to have you as a boyfriend,' the father said.

That very night, HeMeYou's son decided it was time.

'I actually wanted to tell you something in the car, but I was afraid you’d get in an accident,' he said at the dinner table. 'I’m gay.'

HeMeYou wrote: 'I had my arm around him and he was leaning his head on my chest, and all I could think of was that I’m the happiest father on earth right now.'

Nearly 1,000 total comments came out of the post, the story of which also became one of Buzzfeed's most read stories.

HeMeYou continued the discussion, and gracefully accepted the praise thrown his way for his delicate handling of the situation.

'I think that as long as the parents keep a loving relationship with their children and really emphasize that no matter what, they’ll love their child, it will be as easy as it can get for the children of this day in age,' he wrote.
