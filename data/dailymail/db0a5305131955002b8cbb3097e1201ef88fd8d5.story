Hundreds of people with lung cancer have been diagnosed and given potentially lifesaving surgery as a result of a hard-hitting advertising campaign, say experts.

Anyone with a cough lasting more than three weeks was urged to see their doctor during the six-week Be Clear On Cancer campaign in the summer.

It led to around 700 extra patients being diagnosed with lung cancer - many at an early stage – and 300 more patients getting surgery which gives them the best chance of prolonged survival.

Fewer than one in seven of the 38,000 new cases every year are diagnosed early enough for effective treatment by surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy.

Although survival rates for other forms of the disease have significantly improved in the last 30 years, they have remained almost static for lung cancer – the biggest cancer killer.

On average patients will live for just five months after diagnosis compared to nearly 10 years for cancers affecting the bowel and breast.

Dr Mick Peake, lung cancer expert and consultant in respiratory medicine at the University of Leicester, said ‘We are starting to see a dramatic change in potentially curative treatments for lung cancer. 

‘As a result of the Be Clear on Cancer campaign we’ve seen as much progress, particularly in the proportion of patients having an operation for their lung cancer, in those three months as in the previous two years.’

Pleased: Dr Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said it was 'great news' the campaign had raised awareness of lung cancer symptoms

The £1.8 million campaign is part of a Government drive to improve early cancer diagnosis in the hope of saving an extra 5,000 lives a year by 2015.

Adverts on the TV, radio and in newspapers and magazines in August urged people to go to the GP if they had a cough lasting longer than three weeks.

An analysis of the results by Cancer Research UK charity found almost 10 per cent more people - around 700 -  were diagnosed with lung cancer than in the same months the previous year.

Around 400 more patients had their lung cancer picked up at an early stage – the earlier cancer is detected the more likely treatment is to be successful. 

There was also a significant fall in the proportion of people diagnosed at a late stage.

Around 300 more of those diagnosed received surgery which is vital for better survival.

The successful results mean the campaign is likely to run again next year.

Dr Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said ‘It is great news that this campaign has raised awareness of lung cancer symptoms among those most at risk of the disease. 

‘By acting quickly if you notice a possible symptom, you can give yourself the best chance of survival. In many cases it won’t be cancer, but it is better to be sure and, if it is cancer, to detect it earlier rather than later. ‘

Dr Penny Woods, Chief Executive of the British Lung Foundation, said ‘Current lung cancer survival rates in the UK are sadly very low, and it is an area in which we lag considerably behind the rest of Europe and the US.  

‘Naturally, we won’t know for sure until subsequent years whether this impact will be a lasting one, but these very positive early indications seem to confirm that such awareness campaigns can make real tangible differences to people’s lives.

‘Coming when new figures revealed lung cancer surgery rates to be at a record high, the Be Clear of Cancer findings tentatively suggest that we might finally be turning a corner in tackling a disease that has been killing too many for too long.’

Sean Duffy, National Clinical Director for Cancer at NHS England, said ‘Until recently a lung cancer patient in Sweden was nearly 70 per cent more likely to survive their disease for at least five years than if they lived in England.’

Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Wellbeing at Public Health England HE, said ‘To see such encouraging results from the first national Be Clear on Cancer lung campaign is very reassuring.  

‘We are now looking to re-run the campaign in 2014 which we hope will improve survival for even more patients.’
