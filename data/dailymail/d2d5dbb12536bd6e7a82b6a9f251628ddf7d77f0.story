Lee Rigby's family have fought hard to stop Far Right groups co-opting his name for their causes

The mother of murdered soldier Lee Rigby yesterday told of her anger that an extremist party had been officially permitted to use his name on ballot papers for next month's European elections - the first anniversary of his death.

As the approval given to Britain First - which describes itself as a 'patriotic resistance frontline' - was branded 'alarming' by Commons Speaker John Bercow and 'sickening' by a coalition minister, Lyn Rigby said she was 'heartbroken' that they had been allowed to attempt to hijack the tragedy for their own ends.

The Electoral Commission has now made a grovelling apology for allowing Britain First to use the slogan 'Remember Lee Rigby' on voting slips for next month's poll, accepting it should never have been permitted.

Fusilier Rigby's family have consistently distanced themselves from Far Right groups seeking to make capital out of his murder by two Islamic extremists, and his mother immediately hit out at the decision, writing on Facebook: 'Their views are not what Lee believed in and has (sic) no support from the family.'

Highlighting that the poll takes place on May 22 - the first anniversary of his killing - she added: 'Well yet again can any more heartbreak be thrown at me and my family so heartbroken tonight.'

The Electoral Commission have apologised for allowing Britain First to use the slogan on European election ballot papers but says it's too late to change

Fusilier Rigby, a 25-year-old father of one, was hacked to death by Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale near Woolwich Barracks in south-east London last year.

As protests were held in the days after his horrific death, his family called for a peaceful response saying he 'would not want people to use his name as an excuse to carry out attacks against others'.

On Saturday the Commission said it had 'only just realised this mistake', saying the slogan 'should never have been permitted'.

It said it had apologised directly to the Rigby family but said it was too late for the ballot papers to be changed.

It approved the slogan for Britain First to use across the UK, but it is currently only thought to be using it in Wales.

Jenny Watson, chair of the Electoral Commission, said 'an immediate and full independent investigation' would follow to 'prevent this from ever happening again'.

However a deepening political storm yesterday saw Cabinet Office minister Greg Clark said it was 'sickening' that anyone could try to make 'political capital' out of Fusilier Rigby's murder.

He called for a 'full investigation' by the Speaker's Committee, which oversees the work of the commission.

'The whole country will be outraged that the memory of Lee Rigby should be abused in this way, and our heart goes out to his family, friends and colleagues,' he added.

A spokesman for Mr Bercow branded the approval for the slogan an 'alarming development' and said he too wanted an independent inquiry conducted as a 'matter of urgency'.

Earlier this year Adebolajo, 29, was given a whole-life term while Adebowale, 22, was jailed for a minimum of 45 years for his murder.
