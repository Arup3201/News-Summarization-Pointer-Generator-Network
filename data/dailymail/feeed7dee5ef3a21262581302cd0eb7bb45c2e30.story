Plans to use public money to fund a halal abattoir in Wales that uses non-stun slaughter has sparked fury. File photo

Vets have condemned plans to use taxpayers' money to fund a halal abattoir that uses non-stun slaughter.  

The British Veterinary Association is calling on the Welsh government to end talks with Pak Mecca Meats over subsidising job creation at its Cig Menai Cymru abattoir in Caernarfon, Wales.

On its website, the company says it supplies the 'best quality stun free meat in accordance with the highest halal procedures'.

It adds that 'given the choice 90% of Muslims prefer non-stun method of slaughter when it comes to consuming halal meat'.

The BVA wrote to Rebecca Evans, Deputy Minister for Farming and Food, and were told the abattoir has been approved by the Food Standards Agency to carry out non-stun killing.

She confirmed the Welsh Government was 'in dialogue with a private company regarding job creation at an abattoir in Caernarfon'.

But vets have cited animal welfare concerns and blasted the Welsh Government's consideration of using public money to support the company.

The European Union requires animals to be stunned before slaughter but allows countries, including Wales, to make exemptions on religious grounds.  

The BVA wants to end these exemptions and ensure all animals are pre-stunned before slaughter.

A petition calling for the end of non-stun slaughter has more than 95,000 signatures.

John Blackwell, President of the BVA, said: 'BVA advocates that all animals which enter an abattoir be stunned before being killed – this view is based on scientific evidence that shows that non-stun slaughter allows animals to perceive pain.

'Concern about welfare of animals at slaughter is a priority not only for our members, but also the general public.' 

'This is a clear signal that the Welsh Government is out of touch with the public on this issue. It must align its policies with animal welfare concerns and public opinion today.'

Rob Davies, President of the Welsh branch of the BVA, added: 'The Welsh Government has failed to answer questions about whether or not they are willing to give financial support to a company which undertakes and promotes non-stun killing as a marketing tool. 

Halal means permitted or lawful for Muslims. 

Halal food is what is allowed to be eaten according to Islamic scripture.

These foods need to be properly prepared by specific processes, including 'halal slaughter'.

To be halal certified the animal must be facing Mecca, have its throat cut while still alive and then ritually sacrificed by a Muslim who recites a prayer dedicating the slaughter to Allah. 

Foods that are haram (forbidden) in Islam include (but are not exclusive to) pork products, alcohol, blood and carnivorous animals. 

'It seems that animal welfare is not a concern for the Deputy Minister in this particular discussion.' 

Mr Davies urged the Welsh Government to confirm that it will not spend public money on abattoirs which don't stun animals before killing them.

He added: I would appeal to Welsh farmers to consider the damage done to the image and reputation of Welsh meat if they knowingly take or send animals to an abattoir which doesn't stun before killing, whether a local abattoir or a distant one. 

'Welsh meat must be welfare friendly from birth to slaughter.'

The TaxPayers' Alliance say that public money should not be used for expanding any business, regardless of what the business is.

Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Taxpayers shouldn't be footing the bill for any business to expand. 

'It's ridiculous that politicians pick winners using our hard-earned cash, regardless of whether the business is contentious or not. 

'A friendly business environment means lower taxes, not corporate welfare.'
