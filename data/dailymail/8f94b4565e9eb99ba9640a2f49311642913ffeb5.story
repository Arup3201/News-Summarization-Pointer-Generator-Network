A woman accused of swindling almost £250,000 from an elderly multi-millionairess told police that the money had been given to her as presents.

Susan Butt, 48, said cheques she received from Joyce Harrison were gifts to help her set up and run a bar/restaurant with her partner.

However, police found records of payments made by Butt’s business to restaurants in London, on car parking in Knightsbridge, on designer clothing and to a scuba diving firm and a marina.

Susan Butt at Guildford Crown Court, is accused of taking £250,000 from the late wife of multi-millionaire Peter Harrison, computer tycoon and a vice president of Chelsea football club

Mrs Harrison, who has since died aged 77, was the former wife of computer tycoon and vice-president of Chelsea Football Club, Peter Harrison.

Butt said nobody in the Harrison family was aware of the payments, including the Harrison’s’ son-in-law, Peter Lee, who managed the family’s finances, because Mrs Harrison thought they would disapprove.

She described the situation as 'secret squirrel'.

Yet before she died, in September last year, Mrs Harrison gave a statement to police in which she told officers: 'I feel stupid to have been taken in by Susan Butt. I feel betrayed by her.'

Jurors heard that Butt had been the live-in lover of the Harrisons' son, Nicholas and claimed that she had been ill-treated by him.

Justin Rouse, defending, said the abuse had forged a bond between his client and Mrs Harrison because the elderly lady had been beaten by her former husband.

Prosecutor Ian Acheson said: 'It was this bond of trust that the defendant exploited in order to defraud Mrs Harrison.'

Butt is accused of filling in pre-signed blank cheques totalling £237,500, despite already having received £650,000 from Mrs Harrison to buy a house.

A total of £174,500 was paid to the account of Pacific Bar & Grill - Butt’s business in Reigate, Surrey.

Of that £140,000 was then paid into a savings account.

In a police interview read to the court, detectives asked Butt why she had gone to 'Joy' Harrison for more money when she had so much already in a high-interest account.

'How much do you think starting a business costs?', replied Butt.

She said spending at restaurants and other visits to upmarket parts of London were visits to clients or suppliers or as research with their restaurant staff.

Explaining luxury items such as a Hugo Boss suit for her partner and spending at a posh leather goods shop, she said: 'We needed to be smart.'

She admitted the company accounts had been used to pay a Scuba company and a marina in March last year but said that it was because she had had the wrong credit card with her on both occasions.

'It has gone straight back into the account afterwards,' she said.

'Where is it shown going back in?' asked the officer.

'It would have been afterwards,' she replied.

Talking about the entire situation and the secretive element of it, she insisted: 'It was never a loan because I was never asked to pay it back.

'She never wanted it back.

'She wanted to help us but didn’t want anybody else to bully her.'

When officers spoke to Mrs Harrison, who lived in Brockham, Surrey, she told them: 'I had no idea she was writing out cheques to herself or the Pacific Bar & Grill. I was horrified.'

She said she and Butt had been friends and that she trusted her to fill in cheques she had already signed, to pay bills.

Butt, of Hookwood, Surrey, denies fraud and theft.

The trial, before Judge Michael Addison at Guildford Crown Court, continues.
