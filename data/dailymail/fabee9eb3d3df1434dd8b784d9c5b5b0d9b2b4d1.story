After Barcelona took a giant step towards winning the La Liga title with a 2-1 win in El Clasico on Sunday night the squad looked ready to celebrate in style - except Lionel Messi that is.

While team-mates including Neymar Jnr, Dani Alves, and Adriano got suited and booted in their garish designer suits, the Argentina forward opted for a more conservative look.

On the pitch Messi has the ability  to set the place alight but his ensemble on Sunday night left him looking distinctly average in comparison to his South American team-mates.

The 27-year-old plumped for a plain black jumper and the sort of grey trousers you might have worn as part of a school uniform. In fact, Messi wouldn't have looked out of place delivering a lesson to a group of geography students.

That said, even the snappiest of dressers might be made to feel like a wallflower standing next to the flamboyant Neymar and Alves.

The Brazilian duo caused quite a stir on social media with their choice of attire. Alves went for a silver jacket and gold shoes combo 

While a night of celebrations might have been in order for some of the squad, Gerard Pique, who turned in a superb defensive performance at the Nou Camp, looked set for a quiet night in with the missus.

After his impressive performance, Pique left the stadium with his pop star girlfriend Shakira

Pique earned rave reviews as Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema were kept relatively quiet during what could prove a season-defining victory.

And Shakira appeared as impressed by her man's performance as anyone tweeting: 'Gerard Pique is THE Defender! Shak.'

Jeremy Mathieu and Luis Suarez scored for the hosts either side of a Cristiano Ronaldo striker as Barcelona opened up a four-point lead over rivals Real Madrid.
