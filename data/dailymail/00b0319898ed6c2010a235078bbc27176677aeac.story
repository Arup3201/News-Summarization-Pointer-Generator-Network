Opponents of Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi brought chaos to the streets of Cairo as they bombarded the presidential palace with petrol bombs.

Security forces used tear gas and water cannons to try to control the raging crowd on the eighth day of political violence sweeping the country.

Around 6,000 protesters gathered outside the palace in an upscale district of the capital, banging on the gates and throwing stones and shoes into the grounds in a show of contempt.

The protesters accuse Mursi of 
betraying the spirit of the revolution by concentrating too much power 
in his own hands and those of his Muslim Brotherhood.

Crowds chanted 'Leave, leave,' in a clear message to the under-pressure politician. .

Security forces inside the palace responded by firing water cannons at the crowd, then volleys of tear gas, injuring at least 15 people.

The streets outside the palace became a scene of mayhem as police fired volley after volley of tear gas trying to drive back the protesters, who rained stones on the riot police.

'This is all because of Morsi,' one protester shouted. At least 15 people were injured in the clashes, police said.

Thousands more rallied in central Tahrir Square, while a larger crowd marched through the Suez Canal city of Port Said.

The demonstrations mark the second anniversary of the uprising that overthrew Hosni Mubarak.

The country's most influential Islamic had attempted to ease tensions by 
gathering rival political leaders for crisis talks on Thursday.

He persuaded them to sign up to a charter disavowing violence and 
committing to dialogue, after the head of the army to warn this week that the state was on the verge of collapse.

But the talks were overshadowed when the President's opponents called for nationwide protests.

The Muslim Brotherhood accuses Mursi's 
opponents of trying to bring down Egypt's first democratically elected 
leader and to seize power through street unrest.

In a statement released last night, 
leftist leader Hamdeen Sabahi said signing the peace initiative did not 
mean an end to the protests.

He said he would not enter dialogue until bloodshed
was halted, the state of emergency lifted and those responsible for the
previous week's violence brought to justice.

Fatal: The wave of political demonstration is in its eighth day, with 60 people have been killed

The rise of Mursi, an elected 
Islamist, after generations of rule by authoritarian, secular military 
men in the most populous Arab state, is seen as one of the most significant results of the Arab Spring.

But his tenure has failed 
to unite Egyptians and protests have made the country seem all but 
ungovernable.

The instability has worsened an economic crisis, forcing 
Cairo to drain currency reserves to prop up its pound.

Recent violence has been worst in cities along the Suez Canal, especially Port Said, where demonstrators were enraged by death sentences given to 21 football fans for involvement in fatal stadium riots last year.

Dozens of protesters were shot dead in Port Said and Mursi responded by imposing a state of emergency and curfew.

Brotherhood supporters battled protesters outside the presidential palace during protests against Mursi in December.

Collapse: Clashes led the head of the army to warn that the state could be on the verge of collapse

Critics accused the Brotherhood of deploying a militia against the demonstrators, but keen to avoid a repeat, the Islamists have so far kept off the streets during the latest wave of protests.

Thursday's meeting of political leaders was convened by Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayyeb, head of the 1,000-year-old al-Azhar university and mosque, one of the few institutions still seen as neutral.

He persuaded participants to sign a document pledging to renounce violence and agree to set up a committee to plan more talks.

That marked a climbdown by Mursi's foes who had previously rebuffed invitations to negotiate, demanding that Mursi first promise to include them in a unity government.

The presidency said the initiative was 'an important step on the road to achieving stability in the Egyptian street'.

But it is far from clear that opposition politicians could call off the street demonstrations, even if they wanted to.

The protest movement has become a spontaneous expression of anger, often only loosely allied to the secularist and liberal parties running against the Brotherhood in elections.
