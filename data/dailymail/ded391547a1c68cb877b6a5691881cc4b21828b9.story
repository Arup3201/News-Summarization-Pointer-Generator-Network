Wildlife presenter Sir David Attenborough is the most trustworthy public figure in Britain, according to a study.

The public was asked to vote on a list of 84 well-known people, judging them on traits such as likeability, trust and courage to create a list of modern heroes and heroines called the Freuds Heroes Index.

Sir David came out on top in the trust index, ahead of broadcaster Sir Trevor McDonald and the Queen.

Favourites: The Duchess of Cambridge was the most likeable, and Simon Weston was the most heroic

The Duchess of Cambridge came first in the likeability category, with Prince William second.

Falklands War hero Simon Weston was top in the overall hero category.

Mr Weston, 52, said he was ‘flattered and humbled’ by the news and added: ‘True heroism is about risking your life to save others who are not in a position to help themselves – often people you don’t even know.

'Our soldiers do that every day. It is their duty.’

London Mayor Boris Johnson ranked highest of politicians included in the overall hero index, coming in at number 55, ahead of David Cameron in 68th. 

Hero and anti-hero: David Attenborough was popular, but Russell Brand 'appears to go out of his way to avoid having any of the characteristics of a hero at all', according to the poll

Controversial comedian Russell Brand was named as the index’s ‘anti-hero’.

He was described as ‘a man who appears to go out of his way to avoid having any of the characteristics of a hero at all’.

The list was compiled by the influential PR firm Freuds.
