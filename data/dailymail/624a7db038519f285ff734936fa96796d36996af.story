They say that opposites attract. And for Jimmy and Claire Dean, friends certainly believe that is the case - based on looks.

With his receding hairline, pot belly and one eye, Jimmy, 54, himself would admit he's no Brad Pitt.

But the greying divorcee doesn't care that he is the target of jibes, having fallen for - and married - his daughter's stunning school friend, who is 25 years his junior.  

Claire and Jimmy and now married and a year ago welcomed their first child, son Jimmy Junior

The size-8 blonde  was just 17 when she fell for her classmate's father, despite him being quarter of a century older than her.

Jimmy and Claire, from March, Cambridgeshire,  have even been nicknamed Beauty And The Beast by friends as many think Claire,  29, could do better.

But the unlikely couple have proved doubters wrong by marrying and having a son, Jimmy Junior, now aged one. 

‘I love Jimmy no matter what,’ Claire said. ‘He makes me so happy. That’s all I care about.’

 The couple are often referred to as 'Beauty And The Beast' due to their appearance 

The couple first met when Claire and Jimmy’s daughter, Gemma, became friends after meeting at a nearby fair.

Claire said: ‘Gemma’s family ran the local fairground and Jimmy gave me a job working there for a few months when I was 15. I loved it but afterwards we lost touch for a couple of years.

‘Then Gemma and I met by chance one day when we were both out shopping. Looking back now, I think it must have been fate.

‘Gemma told me her mum and dad were going through a divorce. She was staying at her dad’s house with her younger brothers. We got chatting and she invited me round for a cuppa and a proper catch up.’

Claire says the pair share the same sense of humour and that age and appearance don't matter to her 

But when she arrived, Claire got more than a mug of tea. She fell in love.

‘Jimmy made my tummy flip. I couldn’t ignore the butterflies,’ the stay-at-home mother said. ‘I saw past the fact he was older, balding and paunchy.

'To me, he was gorgeous. I’d always liked him as a person, but now I was seeing him in a different light.’

As a single parent, Jimmy was struggling with juggling his fairground business and sons, Charlie, then 11, and James, then 12.

Many people did not approve of the couples relationship, but that didn't stop them from marrying

So Claire offered to help.

‘I moved in and acted a bit like an au pair. I helped him with the children and lived in his spare room rent-free,’ she said. 

‘I got on with them so well, they became like an extended family. Best of all, I got to be around Jimmy all the time. I made sure I always looked my best, hoping and praying that Jimmy might notice and see me in a different light.’

But love struck Claire feared her crush was unrequited.

‘I told myself to get over it, that a guy like Jimmy would never be interested in a silly young girl like me. So I pushed my feelings aside, and listened while Jimmy told me about his divorce and work problems.

‘Lot’s of boys my own age asked me out on dates, but I rejected every single one. I only had eyes for a man almost three times my age, though I didn’t tell them that. I just said I was happy being single. I didn’t confide in my friends either, I knew they wouldn’t understand.

‘Sometimes I was sure Jimmy was flirting with me, but I was never brave enough to take it further.’

A month later, the couple were at a Queen tribute concert.

‘We were singing along to Crazy Little Thing Called Love when Jimmy leant in and kissed me,’ Claire said.

‘My whole body tingled. It was the magical moment I’d be waiting for. Jimmy’s son Charlie saw it all and yelled “Get in there, Dad.” I went bright red, but deep down I was ecstatic.

‘We became inseparable. Jimmy would treat me to meals out, but I was just as happy lounging on his sofa watch telly. We were so comfortable in each other’s company, that’s how I knew it was the real deal,’ she said.

After dating for two months, Claire told her family about her relationship.

‘Mum said that as long as we were happy that was all that mattered and she was right. Dad said, “Better Jimmy than someone your own age who’ll mess you about". Best of all, Jimmy’s children were overjoyed.

‘I was worried about Gemma in particular, after all we were friends and I was dating her dad, but she said she was over the moon.’

Yet some people weren’t as accepting, and not everyone believed that their relationship was the real deal.

‘My mates thought I was mad,’ Claire said. ‘They asked what I saw in him and some called us Beauty And The Beast. I thought it was really upsetting but Jimmy saw the funny side.

Claire  fell for Jimmy at 17, moving in to work as an au pair  to be close to him (pictured early in  relationship)

‘Others said he must be really well endowed to woo a woman like me. It is true we have an amazing love life, but that’s not why I’m with him.

‘Strangers in the street even commented. One woman called me a gold digger when she saw Jimmy and me having a smooch out shopping. He has done well for himself, but I work hard looking after the house and Jimmy Junior.

Another told me that she thought it was gross.

‘We just rise above it. They’re clearly unhappy or jealous. What Jimmy and I have together is true love, and if people have a problem with that then that’s their issue, not mine.’

Such pressure might have driven some couples apart, but not Jimmy and Claire.

‘If anything it’s brought us closer together,’ she said. ‘When we first started dating Jimmy lied about his age, saying he was 40, not 42.

‘When he finally admitted it, I told him I’d love him the same, even if he was 82.

Claire says she puts a great deal of effort into her appearance and figure to look good for Jimmy 

‘It’s not all about looks, even though I think Jimmy is incredibly sexy, it’s about what’s on the inside that counts.

‘When Jimmy was in his 20s he was attacked, causing his left eye to droop due to muscle damage. My friends always mentioned it, but I never noticed.’

The snide remarks became more common when Jimmy had to have his left eye removed in 2009, after the couple had been together seven years.

‘As he was wheeled down to theatre he asked how I could stay with him with only one eye. I said, two eyes or one eye, you’ll always be The One.

‘Luckily we share the same wicked sense of humour and we’re always giggling. Shortly after his op we went car shopping, and I eventually settled on a gorgeous white Mercedes.

‘As the salesman handed me the keys he said to Jimmy, “Your daughter will be very happy with her choice.” We both exploded into hysterical laughter. The dealer looked mortified.’

Jimmy proposed to Claire in 2006, when they’d been together five years and they married in March 2009 at March registry office.

‘It was just three days before my 24th birthday and I felt like a princess in my tight, white dress,’ Claire said. ‘Jimmy was my Prince Charming.

Jimmy and Claire recently celebrated their fifth wedding anniversary (pictured on their wedding day)

‘We’d always discussed having kids, and I knew I wanted to be a mum. When we found out I was expecting Jimmy was overjoyed.’

Jimmy Junior arrived in January 2014.

‘Jimmy is such a good dad, he was always up first in the night if Jimmy Junior cried. He knows how important my beauty sleep is,' Claire said.

‘I loved being mummy to a newborn, but I hated what had happened to my body.

‘I had to work so hard to get back into my size 8 jeans. I booked regular trips to have my hair and nails done just to feel like me again. Jimmy appreciated it too. I like to look good for him as he shows me off to his mates. He calls me his ‘little cracker.’

‘Jimmy is more laid back and eats whatever he likes. The only veg he’s interested in is vegging out on the sofa.

‘I’ve offered him the chance to join me for a salad or on one of my runs but he hasn’t taken me up on it,’ she said.

Jimmy and Claire recently celebrated their fifth wedding anniversary, and they’re both adamant there’ll be many more to come.

Claire said: ‘I know it may get tough when Jimmy’s an old man, but I’m not stupid, I’m prepared to care for him.

‘I love him as much now as the day I met him. People say Jimmy’s the lucky one, but I know that it’s the other way round. He’s my soul mate.’

Jimmy said: ‘I really thought one day she would wake up and see she could do so much better. I really am the beast and she’s the beauty. I feel so proud to know she’s mine. She could be with someone her own age in her own league. My friends don’t know how I did it, and I have to agree with them.’
