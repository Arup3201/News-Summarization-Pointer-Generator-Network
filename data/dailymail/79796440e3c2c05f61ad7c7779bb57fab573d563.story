They are familiar sights around Paris and Rome but love-locks, inscribed by couples and attached to bridges, are becoming increasingly popular in New York with hundreds taking over Brooklyn Bridge.

The romantic mementos are increasingly appearing on the 1883 suspension bridge - particularly since Valentine's Day on Tuesday - as couples rush to make a public pledge to one another while taking in the Manhattan skyline.

They are basic, every-day padlocks inscribed or doodled on with dates and initials of the couple, who are then supposed to throw their key in the water as a public statement of their 'everlasting love'.

A 'love-lock' hangs on Brooklyn Bridge. Thousands have appeared on the landmark in recent years

The practice is popular in Europe and has had a boost in recent years from Federico Moccia's novel Ho Voglia di Te, which featured a couple doing it in Florence.

It seems it started as a spontaneous practice stumbled upon and copied by romantic couples the world over without any idea who did it first.

But it is now so popular, in some places, tourist stalls are cashing-in selling expensive locks to lovers so they can still make a pledge even if they are ill-prepared.

Also despite it being a seemingly innocent activity, many cities say they have had to stamp it out to protect old structures and stop it multiplying without limits, something New York may have to consider in the future.

In Florence, Italy, thousands of locks were removed from the world famous Ponte Vecchio as authorities claimed it was damaging the bridge. The same was done in Dublin and to try to reduce the practice in Rome a website was established so that couples could just leave a lock 'virtually'.

Locked: In Europe all sorts of landmarks are targeted, including this statue on the Alexandre III bridge in Paris

In fact Italy's capital is one of the most affected cities and in 2007 a lamppost on the Ponte Milvio reportedly collapsed due to the weight of the locks attached to it.  

In New York, the practice is officially against city rules but Department for Transportation officials appear to turn a blind eye.

They have previously warned that 'on occasion' they will remove the locks 'as necessary' following their inspections, according to the New York Daily News.

Other cities believe the romantic practice attracts tourists and have even taken steps to promote it.

In Liverpool in the UK, a sign on the Albert Docks reads: 'This is a special place for lovers! Interlock your padlocks on the railings and throw away the key into the Mersey. You will never lose your true love!'

Among the recent wave of locks which have appeared on Brooklyn Bridge the quality of the endeavor varies massively.

Some couples simply pen their names on novelty locks while others take on a more professional approach with fully engraved or painted designs.

Every odd bit of metal which can be found on the bridge appears to have been targeted including metal parts of the structure, benches, and rusting old hooks in the stonework.

In parts of Rome, Italy, it has been outlawed after a large number of locks caused a lamp-post to partially collapse in 2007
