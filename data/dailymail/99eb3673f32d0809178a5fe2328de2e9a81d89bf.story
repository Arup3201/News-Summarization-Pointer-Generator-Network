FIFA 15 is not released until September 26 in the UK, but fans are already whetting their appetite with a promotional video released to show off brand new features.

EA Sports' priority for FIFA 15 was to make the most responsive game ever by introducing an agility and control feature.

Realistic features: The likes of Neymar, Messi and Ronaldo will have specific characteristics

Sliding in: New defending techniques will bring to life the art of being a centre-back

Enhanced: EA Sports have been working at redeveloping the bio-mechanics of the game

The feature brings true personality to the world's best players - Lionel Messi, Neymar, Cristiano Ronaldo and Co. - by redeveloping the bio-mechanics of the game.

When in control of a player, a range of new strides and moves are available to feel even more in touch with the game. Cutting, sprinting and exploding out of turns, this FIFA will be the most realistic ever.

Messi, will visibly favour his left foot throughout the game, while the ball is now programmed to move in correspondence to the spin.

Man-to-man battles are another new feature of the game, and if you're a fan of off the ball defending, shirt tugs and shoulder barges make defending even more physical.
