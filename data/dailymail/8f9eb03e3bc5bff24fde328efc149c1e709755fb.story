One in five Instagram users now combine their photos into a single image before uploading it to the app.

To capitalise on this, the Californian firm has launched its latest standalone app called Layout that lets people create such collages with up to nine images and 11 combinations.

Photos can be selected from the phone's camera roll, or taken with the Photo Booth tool, and Layouts can then be 'remixed' and edited with mirror effects and flips. 

Instagram has launched a photo collage app called Layout. Users begin by selecting as many images, up to the maximum of nine, to feature in the collage (pictured left). As they add more images the layout of the collage changes and photos can be dragged between sections and different sized boxes as desired (right)

It is branded in the same way as Instagram's other standalone timelapse app, Hyperlapse. 

The Layout app has four main features called Faces, Mirroring, Photo Booth and Previews. 

Users begin by selecting as many images, up to the maximum of nine, to feature in the collage. Photos can be selected or deselected at any point. 

As they add more images, the layout of the collage changes and photos can be dragged between sections and different sized boxes as desired.

Pictures can be chosen from a phone's camera roll, or users can use the Photo Booth feature to set a timer and capture photos. 

There are a number of different tools which allow users to 'remix' their layout including mirror effects, flip, pinch to zoom, and rotate. 

The Faces tab scans all the photos in a user's camera roll and only shows those containing people. 

Once the Layout is complete it can be shared to Instagram or Facebook, or saved to their camera roll to be shared elsewhere.

These photos can then be zoomed, flipped to form a mirror image, or turned upside down.

Instagram said that of the collages already uploaded to the app, 90 per cent of these contain faces.

The app has therefore added a Faces tab that scans all the photos in the user's camera roll to show those in which it detects a face. 

Importantly though, this is facial detection and not facial recognition and the app can't identify people in the photos. 

Meanwhile, the Photo Booth feature acts in the same way as a standard photo booth. 

Once the shutter is pressed the app takes four photos, a few seconds apart, using the front-facing camera. 

All collages can be previewed and saved, or they can be uploaded to Instagram or Facebook.

People don't need to have an Instagram or Facebook account to use Layout, though, and once saved the collages can be emailed, sent by text and Whatsapp, and uploaded to other social networks.

The app is available on iOS from today and Instagram told MailOnline it will be launching on Android 'in the coming months'.

Layout is the latest spinoff app to launch from Instagram.

In August it launched Hyperlapse which lets people easily create timelapse videos, and it claims can recreate a $15,000 image stabilising camera with a smartphone.

This means video are stabilised, regardless of what speed the timelapse is played back at.
