Tragic: Terry Hall, 13, is believed to have died on his birthday after slipping on a frozen lake

A boy found dead on his 13th birthday is believed to have slipped on a frozen lake while walking a dog he had been given as a present.

Terry Hall, from Huyton, near Liverpool, is thought to have drowned as he took his new pet for a walk in a park near his home.

Police were called to Stadt Moer Park after a walker spotted his body at around 1pm yesterday.

His death is not being treated as suspicious.

Tributes poured in on a Facebook page dedicated to the youngster, who attended Knowsley Park Centre for Learning.

Friend Liam Hutton wrote: 'I miss you too much. I just can't believe it. I always cry thinking it was your birthday. 

'Have a good one up there, you remember I am thinking about you.'

Lucy Marshall added: 'Always had a smile on your face. Miss you.'

Alicia Marie Dodd said: 'RIP Terry. I didn't really know you but I saw you around school with a big massive smile on your face. 

'Shame you had to go so early, still had a lot to live for. My thoughts go out to his family+close friends!'

Judy Walker, headmistress at the 13-year-old's school in Knowsley, Merseyside, said: 'Terry was an extremely popular boy who was always happy and cheerful.

'He was always keen to learn and particularly loved general knowledge and memorising interesting facts. He'll certainly be remembered for the lovely smile that he always had.

'Everyone at the school is devastated at this tragic loss of a young boy who was so full of fun and had so much potential.'

A neighbour of the teenager told the Liverpool Echo: 'We are all in shock. He was such a nice lad, he'd let on to you all the time and he was just really pleasant.

'He had eight brothers and sisters and we know all the family. Everyone is devastated.'
