Residents in a north London council block have spoken of their terror as a lone gunman spent three hours firing a pistol from his ground-floor flat.

The incident took place on Saturday afternoon and ended with the gunman being shot by police marksmen. 

The 48-year-old man has been described as 'deranged' by one of his neighbours in the council block in Hendon, London, which is due to be demolished next month.

Shot: The 48-year-old gunman was one of only a handful of residents still living in the 13 storey council block in Hendon, north London, which is due to be demolished next month

Police were called to the scene after neighbours reported hearing loud bangs and seeing a gun being fired from the man's flat between 5pm and 8pm on Saturday night.

More than a dozen marked police cars and vans raced to the block of flats and sealed off nearby streets. 

The council block remained cordoned off on Sunday as police forensics officers marked spots on the pavement where the 48-year-old's bullets hit the concrete.

Kate Anderson, 55, said: 'I'm scared to death. I heard the shooting last night and thought it was fireworks.

'I looked outside, but I couldn't hear anything. I've only heard gunshots on the television, but after a while I realised it must be a handgun and I thought someone was shooting at birds.

The gunman remains in hospital where he is in a 'serious but not life-threatening' condition, a police spokesperson said today (file photo)

'I could hear helicopters and sirens everywhere and I went back inside as I was frightened.

'I must have heard the shootout with police but its hard to distinguish one gunshot from another.

'Whoever he was, he was clearly deranged. It's awful.'

Another local resident Joe Killeen, 71, who has lived in the area for more than 30 years, said: 'When I came back from watching the rugby around 10pm the police were all here, ambulance, forensics, everything.

'Everybody's frightened now around here. The problem is they're tearing all these flats down and so the council don't mind if their tenants are riff raff. 

Annie Wilcox, who also lives nearby, said: 'We could all hear the gun shots - these loud pops from about 5pm. They went on for three hours. 

'We couldn't see anything, but I think this guy was firing out towards the building site.

'Because he was round the back it took ages to work out where the sound was coming from.

'At first we thought it could have been pieces of wood falling from a nearby building site.' 

The gunman remains in hospital where he is in a 'serious but not life-threatening' condition, a police spokesperson said.
