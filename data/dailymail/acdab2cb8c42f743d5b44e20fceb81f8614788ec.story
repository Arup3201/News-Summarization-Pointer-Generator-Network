Tom Croft's hopes of making the World Cup are in doubt as the Leicester Tigers flanker faces up to six months out of action following surgery to a dislocated shoulder. 

Croft, who was on the bench for England's first three games of the RBS 6 Nations, suffered the injury during Leicester's Aviva Premiership victory against Newcastle Falcons at Kingston Park on March 8.

The Leicester Mercury reports that Croft has undergone surgery on the injury and now faces between four to six months out of action.

It is the latest in a long list of injury setbacks for the talented backrower who started five British and Irish Lions Tests spanning the 2009 and 2013 tours to South Africa and Australia respectively. 

Croft's season with the Tigers is definitely over, but it also doubtful the the blindside will make it back in time for England's pre-season preparations before the World Cup in September.
