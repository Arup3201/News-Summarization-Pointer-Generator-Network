This is the terrifying footage of a British daredevil getting a bird's eye view of an Indian city - by dangling from a crane by one hand. 

James Kingston scaled the 21-storey high crane in Bangalore without a rope or harness.

Once at the top, the 24-year-old from Southampton took in a panoramic view of the city from a camera attached to his head.

More than 600 people have 'liked' the video on James's Facebook page which has more than 100,000 fans. 

It is not the first time James has dizzied viewers with footage from a thrill-seeker's vantage point. 

Last year he shared a video of himself hopping between the rooftops of Cambridge, while another clip showed him dangling from a crane above the town.

Critics at the town's university accused the free-runner of trespassing, a claim which he refutes.

'I've got quite a few good friends in Cambridge, and the rooftops there are the best in the whole UK for what I do. 

'I've trained hard, so I know what I can do, and for me it's just another jump, just another day in the park.

'I've heard a lot of stories of people training in Cambridge and being stopped. I don't know what makes some people hate free-running so much.

The 24-year-old has been free-running for seven years and has scaled cranes in other countries 

Free-running James used a selfie-stick and a camera stuck to his head to film the stunt in India

'Perhaps it's because they think we don't know what we're doing and are causing damage.

'Some people can't understand it and therefore are afraid of it and want to get rid of it as soon as they can.

'I'm not reckless, I care about what I'm doing and we're careful not to damage the buildings we're on.'

A spokesman for Cambridge University said James was endangering himself and others.

He said: 'Not only is it trespassing, but endangering public health and their own health.

'We would not encourage the activities from the video in any way.'
