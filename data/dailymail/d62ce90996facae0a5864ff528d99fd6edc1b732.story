Uruguay will be without the finest player on the planet if Luis Suarez fails to recover from injury in time to play England on June 19.

That is the verdict of Uruguay midfielder Cristian Rodriguez, who said: ‘He is the best player in the world. And I’m not saying that because I’m Uruguayan and so is he.’

Liverpool’s 31-goal star looks like making it back just in time to face Gary Cahill and Phil Jagielka and Rodriguez drives home the importance of his recovery when he says: ‘As far as I’m concerned Leo Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are a notch or so below Suarez. He has demonstrated it for club and country. Messi and Ronaldo are not as good for their countries as for their clubs.’

Suarez looks set to miss Uruguay’s first game of the Finals against Costa Rica in the hope that the extra days will see him start against England alongside Atletico Madrid’s Rodriguez.

‘Everyone loves “Luisito” in the squad,’ he says. ‘He is a rebel on the pitch who fights for every ball but that is what we love about him in Uruguay. We hate to lose at anything, we want to win — so his will to win makes him a good Uruguayan.’

For all the fight on the pitch Rodriguez paints a very different picture of his team-mate off it. ‘All the Atletico Madrid players were in the dressing room watching on television on the day of the draw and the text messages started flying.

'There is a group of us who send messages to one another and Luis is among that group, although he is one of the quieter ones who does not write that much; he tends not to get too excited about these things.’

Rodriguez defends Suarez against the accusation that his quest to always finish on the  winning side means he crosses the line sometimes.

‘He lives for football and in  football if you are not alive then you are asleep and they take the ball off you — “adios”. You have to be smart on the pitch. It’s part of the game. You’ve got  the referee there; he’s there for  something isn’t he?’

Rodriguez agrees Uruguay and England are in the group of death but not just because of the presence of three world champions. ‘No one should underestimate Costa Rica because in a World Cup anything can happen,’ he says of his country’s first opponents.

‘People say Costa Rica will be the easiest rivals but the temperatures will be high and they will be used to the climate and that could make them stronger.’

Does he believe a European team can win this summer’s tournament?

‘It’s not impossible for a European side to win in South America but it is a different climate and the pitches are very different — the surfaces are drier and that slows the game down; and it’s very humid. That is what will test the European teams. In Spain the pitches are kept wet and the ball runs faster so it is going to be very different for them.

‘There is also the added factor of travelling for European sides. Brazil is a massive country so  we have to travel, too; but our starting point is a lot closer!’
