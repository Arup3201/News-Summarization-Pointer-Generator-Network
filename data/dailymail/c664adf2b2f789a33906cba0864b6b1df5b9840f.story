This weekend I’ve been watching four midfielders from what might be considered 'unfashionable' clubs, who are currently not involved in Roy Hodgson’s squad. Three of them would not look out of place in England’s diamond right now, the other is miles away from that level of football.

First up, Tom Huddlestone. Anchoring that England midfield, I can see the Hull City midfielder fitting in nicely.

He’s not the toughest tackler, and he’s not the quickest, but his reading of the game suggests he could anticipate the play so well he wouldn’t need to rely on speed or last-gasp challenges.

England manager Roy Hodgson should look at some midfielders from 'unfashionable' clubs for his squad

One significant aspect of his game is his ability to ping a pass 40 or 50 yards to a lone striker to relieve any pressure. He can do that with accuracy and that is something England haven’t always had.

I’ve always had concerns about Huddlestone’s lack of mobility. His former team-mate Danny Murphy pointed out to me that neither Andrea Pirlo nor Xabi Alonso are renowned for their running, and in England’s qualification group we won’t need to do a huge amount of defending so why not have a look at what Tom Huddlestone can do?

We have been crying out for years for footballers with technical ability - Huddlestone has it in abundance.

He could challenge Jack Wilshere for that place in the starting line-up in my opinion.

What might count against him, though, is his last appearance for England. Roy Hodgson called him up for the friendly in Sweden two years ago. Along with Stoke’s Ryan Shawcross, Huddlestone came on with the team 2-1 up and 16 minutes remaining; England lost 4-2. That will have stuck in the manager’s mind.

Another name is West Ham United's Mark Noble. He was the England Under 21 captain, leading them to the final of the European Championships in 2009. He hasn’t had a look in since then at international level and at the age of 27 time is running out.

I don’t see him at the base of a diamond for England, but I do see him as one of the two in the middle. He is industrious and has more recently started to add consistent quality to his distribution of the ball. Noble can also take a penalty - very few Englishmen can confidently say that. Indeed he once scored twice from the spot in an epic shoot-out against Holland for the U21s.

Like Huddlestone, I’ve had my reservations about Noble for England, but I now think he’s good enough. However I doubt he would be first choice when all of Roy’s options are fit.

I’ve been an admirer of Aston Villa’s Ashley Westwood for a long time and I definitely see him as an option at the base of a diamond for England. His ability from set-pieces is one of his main strengths, but he has so much more.

He can read the game, his defensive work off the ball isn’t always obvious on TV but is a stand-out feature when you watch him live, and he keeps things simple. He gets the ball, and gives it to a team-mate - keeping possession is his main objective, and once again that is something England haven’t always been good at.

I’m amazed a player so good on the ball has not had any international recognition at any level. He admits he bases his style on what Michael Carrick has been doing for Manchester United for many successful years. I just hope that Westwood doesn’t suffer the same fate at international level where Carrick was shamefully ignored during his peak years.

Huddlestone, Noble and Westwood - YES. But Lee Cattermole? No, not for me.

I was at The Stadium of Light on Saturday, Cattermole made a crucial error for Sunderland before Spurs’ second goal, but that wasn’t the main reason I would have misgivings about him at England level.

Cattermole went lunging into challenges, getting very tight to opponents, and being very physical with them. There was nothing subtle in his approach. This sometimes gets him into trouble in the Premier League, as is well documented. His reputation goes before him but that reputation has been well and truly earned.

Lee Cattermole is not good enough on the ball for England and should not be given a call-up by Hodgson

Sunderland's Cattermole (left) is extremely physical and this makes him a yellow card waiting to happen

At international level, with referees more likely to buy the claims of players going to ground easily under a physical challenge, Lee Cattermole is a yellow card waiting to happen. And when on a yellow, can he be trusted not to get another? It’s too big a risk for Hodgson to take in my view.

On top of that Cattermole’s quality on the ball is not exceptional, and certainly inferior to a lot of others challenging for the same position at the base of an England midfield diamond.

Roy Hodgson certainly took note when I labelled Jack Colback the 'Ginger Pirlo; in this column before his recent call-up. Huddlestone, Noble and Westwood will be hoping the England boss is reading this too. I’m confident he will be.
