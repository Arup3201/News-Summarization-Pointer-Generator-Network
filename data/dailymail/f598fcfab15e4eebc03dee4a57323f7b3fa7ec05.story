One of the two Maryland women charged with  murdering two toddlers in a gruesome 'exorcism' last year pleaded guilty, but will not serve any prison time.

Under a plea agreement, Monifa Sanford, 22, pleaded guilty to two counts of first-degree murder and attempted first degree murder, but was not found criminally responsible, ABC 7 reports. 

Instead of prison time, Sanford will be committed to a psychiatric hospital for her role in the January 2014 murder of one-year-old Norell Harris and his two-year-old sister Zyana.  

Sanford and the children's mother, Zakieya Avery, 29, stabbed the toddlers with a serrated knife and choked the two young children in an attempted 'exorcism' because they believed the children were demon possessed.

Plea: Under a plea agreement, Monifa Sanford, 22,  will serve no time in prison for her role in the January 2014 'exorcism' murders of one-year-old Norell Harris and his sister Zyana, 2, but has been committed to a mental institution

Possessed: Sanford and the children's mother, Zakieya Avery, 29, attacked little Norell (left) and Zyana (right) because they believed the children were demon possessed 

Avery's other two  children, then aged five and eight, were also stabbed and choked, but managed to survive.

The testimony at Sanford's hearing Friday was so disturbing that the father of the two children erupted in the courtroom, forcing marshals to lead the man out of the room, WUSA reports.

According to the testimony, Sanford's mental illness included hallucinations and voices, one of which she believed to be satan.

'Satan' allegedly told her that he was going to kill the children and 'if she wanted them to go to heaven, she had to do it herself,' according to the testimony.

'Demon Assassins:' Avery (left) and Sanford (right) believed they were part of a group of 'demon assassins' along with men who, an investigation revealed, were imaginary 

Survived: Avery's other two children, then aged five top left) and eight (top right), were also stabbed and choked, but managed to survive

David Felsen, a defense attorney, said that Sanford believed she had been initiated into a group of 'demon assassins' along with men, who an investigation revealed, were imaginary.

The two women reportedly believed that they themselves had become possessed at some point and that the children were possessed and had evil spirits on them. They also believed that inanimate objects had been possessed, according to WUSA. 

Sanford has been committed to Clifton T. Perkins Mental Hospital and a trial for Avery is expected to take place later this year. 

After the women killed the young children and attacked Avery's older son and daughter on Jan. 17 of last year, they went for each other.

WUSA reports that Avery stabbed and choked Sanford several times and the two eventually struggled over the knife. Avery grabbed the knife and continued to attack Sanford.

At some point, the two stopped the attacks and showered. They washed the bodies of the two small children and one of the older children and laid them on a bed.

Authorities responding to a report of suspicious activity, showed up at Avery's Germantown home at around 9.40am and discovered the gruesome scene.

Norell and Zyana were pronounced dead on the scene. The two older children were treated at the scene then transferred to the hospital. Sanford was taken to a hospital as well.

After the gruesome murders, Sandford reportedly told police 'I'm glad the children are in heaven, but I miss them.'
