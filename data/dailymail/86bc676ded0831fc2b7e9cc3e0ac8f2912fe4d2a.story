A school principal in Texas who allegedly banned her students from speaking Spanish in November has been told by the board she cannot return to her job.

Administrators at Hempstead Middle School voted on Monday night to end the contract of Amy Lacey who has been on paid leave since December after allegedly using the intercom to tell students that Spanish was not allowed to be spoken on school grounds.

The move caused outrage at the school where more than 50 percent of the children are Hispanic - leading to allegations that the children's civil rights had been violated.

'Students were shamed until they did not want to come to school anymore,' Salina Moreno, an attorney with the Latin Legal Voice, to MyFoxHouston.com.

'Non Latino students bullied Spanish speaking students and told them to go back to Mexico.'

The Hempstead Independent School District board on Monday night decided not to retain Amy Lacey, whose contract expires at the end of the school term

Civil rights groups added in after possible hate crimes were reported in the Hempstead - a small town of 6,100, an hour outside Houston.

'When you start banning aspects of ethnicity or cultural identity, it sends the message that the child is not wanted: 'We don't want your color. We don't want your kind.' They then tend to drop out early,' said Augustin Pinedo, director of the League of United Latin American Citizens Region 18.

Advocates for civil rights in Rxas said that the whole debacle may have ignited a campaign to intimidate Hispanics - including the school district's superintendent, Delma Flores Smith.

They have asked for the Department of Justice and the FBI to investigate, but agency officials would not confirm this.

Flores-Smith said she personally has seen strange men watching her home and taking photographs of it.

She claims that vandals have trashed her front yard and someone went through her garbage.

All this has made her worry for her safety.

Indeed, last month, school officials discovered that vandals had damaged the brakes of three Hempstead Independent School District Buses and a dead cat was found on school premises.

'A lot of this sounds like Mississippi in the 1950s and '60s,' Pinedo said during Monday night's school board according to the Houston Chronicle.

Difficult choice: District officials sent a letter to parents assuring them that Spanish is not banned at the Hempstead school, where more than half of the students are Hispanic

However, Pinedo acknowledged that there was no evidence that any of these incidents are related to hate crimes.

'But when the lives of children are put in danger, that's the bottom line,' he said. 'We don't know what the reasons are. Rather than guess, we're asking the FBI to step in.'

Before the vote on Monday, former school board member Kay Kloecker aid that Lacey should be re-instated and blamed Flores-Smith for causing the convection.

'We've been a predominantly Hispanic district for several years now,' she said. 'But we never had a problem until she came.' Flores-Smith started in August.
