Friends of an Australian man believed to be fighting with terror group Islamic State have paid tribute to Zia Abdul-Haq who they say has been killed on the battlefield.

Abdul-Haq - who is also known as Abu Yusseph - lived in Logan, south of Brisbane in Queensland, before he travelled to Syria in August to fight alongside other IS militants, leaving behind his former wife and child.

The man was prolific on social media - including Twitter - and his account was filled with content that made light of the terror group's sinister reputation.

A fellow militant who is thought to have fought alongside Zia Abdul-Haq has confirmed the Logan man is dead

The Australian is thought to have made his way to Syria in August. Friends back home say he was looking for a new wife 

A fellow militant who is thought to have fought alongside Abdul-Haq confirmed his death on October 3, but friends did not learn of his death until Monday.

He paid tribute to the Australian by uploading a photo of Abdul-Haq sitting with his legs crossed in front of him looking at his mobile phone, and then went on to say he had seen his body.

On a Twitter account linked to Wisam Haddad - the man behind the controversial Al-Risalah Islamic Centre in Sydney which closed its doors last month - tributes starting flowing for Abdul-Haq, The Australian reported.

Calling him a 'shaheed', Dr Haddad described his friend as a 'beautiful brother' who was 'always smiling'. 

'Shaheed' means 'martyr' in Arabic.

Dr Haddad also asked 'Allah to accept him' and wrote 'Allahu Akbar' in capitals, which means 'God is the greatest'.

Later he posted a meme-style photo of Abdul-Haq with a weapon behind him superimposed on a blue background with the words: 'Abu Yosouf Al Khura­sani May Allah Accept Him (Martyred on the day of Arafah).'

The Day of Arafah is a holy day in the Islamic faith and is part of the yearly pilgrimage to Mecca.

These words were accompanied by a translated passage from the Qur'an, which read: 'And never think of those who have been killed in the cause of Allah as dead. Rather, they are alive with their lord (sic), receiving provision'.

Other Twitter users also paid tribute to the Logan man who fled to Syria in August

Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Australian Federal Police for comment on this matter.

In the past, Abdul-Zaq has used his Twitter account to showcase what life was like fighting for IS in the Middle East.

He posted a series of videos on YouTube with titles such as 'funny terrorist video part 1' - as well as Twitter images of militants cuddling cats, playing video games and training with assault weaponry.

The Logan man - who friends back home say he travelled to Syria to find a wife - has also tweeted that he was 'proud to be part of #IslamicState' and denied claims he was 'brainwashed' by Australian preacher Musa Cerantonio who was arrested in the Philippines and then deported back to Australian in July.

A couple of weeks later following Cerantonio's deportation, Abdul-Haq posted an image of fighters in the Middle East watching a video of the preacher.

'Mujahideen (warriors) in Ash-Shaam watching Musa Cerantonio's talks #IS #ISIS #jihadist #caliphate #Khilafah,' Abdul-Haq wrote.
