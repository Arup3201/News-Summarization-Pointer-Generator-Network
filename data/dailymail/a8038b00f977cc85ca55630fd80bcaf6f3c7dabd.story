Louis van Gaal 'does not worry in the slightest when he gets criticised' by fans and media, says the person who knows the new Manchester United manager best.

His wife, Truus van Gaal, revealed the former Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss does, however, get upset when he fails to do his job or when it hurts her.

Those at Old Trafford will be glad to hear it takes a lot to bother the 62-year-old - unlike Truus, who admits she once accosted a fan for calling her husband a 'weirdo'.

Truus said: 'Louis does not worry in the slightest when he gets criticised.

'Whether his team plays good or bad, whether the public and media slaughter him or not, he is not affected by anything.

'He always says to me: "What are you worrying about? Let them have their moment of fun. Only you and I know how things really are. They don't."

'The only thing that bothers him is when he sees me getting hurt or upset.'

Truus, though, isn't the same as her husband, as she admitted the insults still get to her.

'A while ago, I went to a football match and this man in front of me said: "Van Gaal is a weirdo, he gives me the creeps." So I tapped him on his shoulder and said to him: "What has he done to you then? Do you know him?" The guy went bright red with embarrassment.'

The pair married six years ago, and Truus says she has seen her husband at his footballing worst.

'I have only seen Louis get really upset about football twice in my life,' continued Truus, as reported by the Daily Mirror.

'Once, when he failed to qualify for the World Cup in 2002, and then when it all went wrong the second time he was in charge at Ajax. He was absolutely devastated when he failed the first time with Holland. He felt that the players, who he had given all his trust, had let him down.

'In his second spell with Ajax he was working as technical director when the club decided to break up the contract.

'What made it worse was that he had turned down brilliant offers from other clubs.'

United's first game of the new Premier League season is against Swansea at home on August 16.
