Gone: Barway Edwin Collins, 10, went missing from his Crystal, Minneapolis, apartment building last Wednesday after school  

Police in Minnesota say they believe the father of a missing 10-year-old boy hasn't been honest about his disappearance.

Barway Collins was last seen after school March 18 near his apartment complex. Police said they were working to find the boy and were checking flights to see whether he might have been sent overseas to his mother, believed to be in Liberia.

Chief Stephanie Revering said Barway's father, Pierre Collins, is now considered a suspect. 

Revering says Collins, who was seen wiping away tears at a vigil held for the boy Monday, was given a lie-detector test and 'we believe he was untruthful.'

Police released a video of Barway riding a bus after school. 

In the video, the boy said 'there's my dad' and 'there's my uncle.' Police want to identify the uncle.

'The father and the party described as an ‘uncle’ are likely the last known people to have seen Barway,' Revering said, as reported by the Star-Tribune. 'Unfortunately, we have reason to believe that Barway’s father has not been completely truthful with us.'

Dozens of relatives, friends and supporters came together Monday in Crystal, Minnesota, to plead for the safe return of Barway Edwin Collins.

Cash was donated to the family as Pierre Collins sobbed and his wife stood, it appeared, at his side in support.

'There's my dad': The footage in question  (pictured) also has audio and, police say, as the bus pulled up to Barway's building he pointed out his father and an uncle. Previously, police had been searching for anyone who might have seen Barway at that point, the moment of his disappearance

Over the past five days, local police, federal agents and Hennepin County's sheriff's deputies have been searching the area for Barway with K-9 dogs, reviewing footage from surveillance cameras and interviewing family members and witnesses. 

According to the Crystal Police Department, a man and woman pictured in a screen shot from a CCTV camera installed at the front entrance of the Cedarwood apartment complex may have witnessed Barway being dropped off from school.

So far, the mystery couple have not been named as suspects or even persons of interest in the case.

Chief Revering said Monday that an Amber Alert has not been issued for Barway because investigators believe he may be with a relative.

While law enforcement officials continued searching for the missing fourth-grader, members of Crystal's Liberian community were busy handing out fliers featuring Barway's picture to help bring him home.

At around 5pm Monday, more than 100 people gathered outside Cedarwood apartments for an emotional prayer vigil.

'We miss Barway,' his father, Pierre Collins, told the crowd. 'Barway has been gone for a very long time now. We are begging and asking everyone to look out there.'

Chief Revering also attended the gathering, promising Barway's family to continue looking for him until he is found, according to Minneapolis Star Tribune. 

Barway was reported missing by his father at around 6.30pm after the child failed to come home from school. A call to the school bus company revealed that the 10-year-old was dropped off outside his building at around 4.15pm.

Mr Collins and his wife, Yamah, said the entrance surveillance camera caught their son opening the front door to the building, looking inside and then closing it, as if someone called him outside.

'Please just bring him back. We just want Barway back. We don't want anything from them. Just let him go. Just let him come home,' the parents begged, according to KARE11.

Collins is described as 5 feet tall, weighing 80lbs with black hair and brown eyes. He was last seen wearing a black jacket, white T-shirt, black pants, red shoes and carrying a red school backpack.

Anyone with information on Barway Collins' whereabouts is being asked to call police.
