Jacob Rees-Mogg MP opposed his mother's building plans

The titled mother of a Tory MP has lost her bid to build a housing 
estate in the middle of the family’s ancestral seat after a wave of 
objections – including from her own son.

Lady Gillian Rees-Mogg had 
planned to build 19 houses in the village of Hinton Blewett, Somerset, 
which dates back to the Domesday Book.

Her son and local MP, Jacob 
Rees-Mogg, opposed the development, which would have increased the 
population by a quarter.

It was close to the Mendip Hills Area of 
Natural Beauty and only 40 yards from a conservation area.

Resident 
David Duckett said: ‘Villagers are relieved.This would have completely 
changed the character of Hinton Blewett.

'It’s important to note we are 
not nimbys – we want development in our backyards, just not our front 
gardens.

'The scale and location were just wrong.’

Todd Foreman, Labour’s candidate for North East Somerset, said: ‘This is a victory for common sense.’
