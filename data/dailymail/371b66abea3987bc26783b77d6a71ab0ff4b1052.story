Gibraltar airport was evacuated this afternoon after a suspect package was discovered on a plane on the runway bound for the UK.

Passengers were taken off an easyJet flight flight to Gatwick when the captain asked for assistance.

The Airbus A319 had 156 passengers and six crew on board.

Police closed the border between Gibraltar and Spain after a suspicious package was reported

Eyewitness Sophie Bichener exclusively told MailOnline Travel: 'I was just travelling to work  when I realised the border was closed.

'The updates from police and citizens showed there was an issue at the runway which turned out to be a suspicious suitcase on the easyjet flight which had just landed.

'I waited at the border for an hour and a half as police moved the crowds back. There didn't seem to be any immediate danger, but moving the crowd to a safe distance seemed appropriate. 

'The Guardia were treating the situation well considering the tension between the two countries and were happy to provide information. 

'This is the second time in a year I have been stuck at the border in the midst of a bomb scare. The Gibraltar threat level remained severe after the recent attacks in Europe and perhaps this is a side effect.'

The Royal Gibraltar Police took to Twitter to explain the situation, saying that along with 'essential services', they were dealing with the situation.

People were evacuated from the plane and the airport as explosive experts moved in

The Gibraltar Chronicle have said the alarm was raised by a baggage handler, while the BBC state the situation was dealt with by military explosives experts.

At least one flight was diverted, a British Airways plane had to go on to Malaga.

The border with Spain was closed, and people were warned to stay away from the airport while an investigation took place.

The areas in and around the airport began to become very busy as the incident was heightened

However, easyJet have said the issue was only related to an unusual smell, and thatdidn't mention anything with regards to suspect luggage.

A spokesperson for easyJet told MailOnline Travel: 'easyJet can confirm that the flight EZY8502 from Gibraltar to London Gatwick on February 8 took a delay due to a smell in the hold of the aircraft which has been thoroughly investigated as a precaution and no cause for concern was detected.'

'The airport has reopened and we expect to begin the boarding process as quickly as possible.

The police told that at least one flight had been forced to divert to Malaga due to the bomb scare

'easyJet would like to thank passengers for their patience and apologise for any inconvenience caused.

'The safety of its passengers and crew is easyJet's highest priority and easyJet operates its fleet of aircraft in strict compliance with all manufacturers' guidelines.'

Back in June last year the Spanish-Gibraltar frontier was closed when police were alerted to a suspicious package, causing misery to thousands of tourists and workers.

A controlled explosion took place and the border was re-opened after about an hour.
