NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione has revealed his wife and daughter were inside Sydney's Lindt cafe just an hour before gunman Man Haron Monis began his deadly siege last Monday.

Mr Scipione said his wife Joy and daughter Emma were with him in central Sydney that morning 'to do a little bit of Christmas shopping'.

'Unbeknownst to me they both decided to slip down into Martin Place and have a look around in the Lindt shop,' Mr Scipione told Macquarie Radio Network on Saturday.

NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione has revealed his wife and daughter were inside Sydney's Lindt cafe just an hour before gunman Man Haron Monis began his deadly siege last Monday

Mr Scipione said his wife Joy and daughter Emma were with him in central Sydney that morning 'to do a little bit of Christmas shopping' 

The Police Commissioner said his wife and daughter were shown around the cafe by Tori Johnson

He said his wife and daughter left the cafe 'about an hour before' Monis, a self-styled Iranian cleric, entered the cafe in Martin Place around 10am, taking 18 people hostage.

Monis was killed in the ensuing gun battle with police 16 hours later.

Sydney lawyer Katrina Dawson, 38, and Lindt cafe manager Tori Johnson, 34, also died in the siege.

'The irony is that they were shown through the shop - all of the chocolates, all of the things you would go there for - by Tori Johnson,' he said.

He said his wife Joy had been 'reflecting' on Mr Johnson since his death.

'He was so open and so caring, he was very, very warm (and) friendly, and he's no longer with us,' Mr Scipione said.

'That still causes many a tear to flow, and she (Joy) has been emotional.'

The commissioner said he didn't think Monis, who was on conditional bail at the time of the attack, should have been at large in the community.

Katrina Dawson was also killed during the Sydney siege. She was a mother-of three and was a highly regarded Barrister 

'Was I frustrated? Yes. Was it something that we would have preferred not be the case? Absolutely. The police refused bail on two occasions previously,' he said.

Commissioner Scipione also defended how officers brought the siege to an end.

He said if police could have used a sniper to end the siege, 'they probably would have done it I would think, rather than risk going through the door, not knowing what they were confronting'.

He said the tactical operations officers stormed into that cafe just after 2am on Tuesday, not knowing if there were explosives in the gunman's backpack.

'I'm sure that when this story does unfold through the coronial process Australia will be proud of what these young men did,' Mr Scipione told 2GB.

'That day they did more than save 16 people, they actually drove a stake into the footpath in Martin Place that says we stand for what's right, we stand for freedom and we are going to do all we can to ensure this nation remains a free nation.'
