'Be sensible': Justin Welby, the Archbishop of 
Canterbury, has issued a warning over the 'ridiculous' materialistic 
excesses of Christmas

Increased financial pressure in the build-up to Christmas ‘spoils life’ for families across the UK, according to the Archbishop of Canterbury.

Criticising the festive period as ‘over the top’, Justin Welby said that high-spending in an attempt to create the perfect Christmas risked making life miserable.

But in a frank admission, the former oil executive said nobody would ‘pay attention’ to his message about the obsession with material goods.

In a warning to hard-pressed families across the UK, Archbishop Welby said: ‘Save up for the Christmas budget, be sensible, don’t put pressure on your finances – don’t make your life miserable with Christmas.’

His description of the festive period as ‘absurd and ridiculous’ follows research that suggests the average family spends £1,000 on Christmas.

The stark assessment of Christmas celebrations are his first comments on the Christian festival since taking over as Archbishop.

He said: ‘The Christian bit of Christmas isn’t the bit that’s getting people into debt.

‘It’s the whole mercantile trading, shopping, over-the-topness, so I don’t feel guilty about it.’

Admitting that our obsession with shopping is unlikely to wane, he said that people should show ‘love and affection rather than trying to buy love and affection’.

He added: ‘You can’t buy it, you can show it, and when you show it, it comes back to you with interest.

‘Share love and affection with reasonable gifts that demonstrate you really care for someone’.

During the interview for ITV’s The Martin Lewis Money Show, the Archbishop admitted his comments were unlikely to make a difference.

He said: ‘It’s a cliché of modern life that someone gets up and says Christmas is becoming very materialistic, as though it wasn’t 300 years ago.

'Yes, obviously the secular over-the-topness, everything you have to have, new clothes you have to have, new this, new that, new the other, is ridiculous, it’s absurd, it shouldn’t happen.

‘It’s obviously not what Christmas is about but to be absolutely honest there’s not much point in saying it because nobody’s going to pay attention.’

'It's obviously not what Christmas is about': Thousands of shoppers trudge along Oxford Street in the gathering gloom last December. Welby called for people to show 'love and affection' rather than trying to buy it
