A retired joiner has said he hopes to change the way people see the humble nail after spending the last 50 years collecting more than 3,000 of them.

Richard Jones, 78, has amassed his hoard of thousands of nails from across the globe - and has now declared: 'I’m not the world’s most boring man'.

He described his collection, which features nails from as far as Australia, Germany, Italy and the United States, as 'fascinating'.

Collector: Over the course of 50 years, Richard Jones has collected more than 3,000 nails from across the globe

Nails: Mr Jones has collected the nails from as far away as Australia, the United States, Italy and Germany

Mr Jones claims to have one of the largest collections in the world kept at his home in Blackwood, South Wales

Mr Jones said he hoped the collection will change the way people see nails.

He said: 'Nails show the history of civilisation. I have nails from all over the world and some of them date back to the Romans.

'The nails really need to be seen to be believed - photographs just don’t do them justice.

'A lot of people say: “They are just nails,” but they don’t see all of the history behind them.

'A lot of people think nails are boring but I think I have changed a lot of people’s minds about nails.

'It’s great I can share my passion and excitement for nails with people and convince them nails are not boring.

Retired: Mr Jones started his collection in the 1960s after starting work as a joiner

Historic: Mr Jones said some of the nails date back to the Romans

'I want to educate people about nails - if you think nails are boring come and see my collection it will change your mind.'

Mr Jones started his collection in the 1960s after starting work as a joiner.

His interest 'snowballed' and he now 
claims to have one of the largest collections in the world kept at his 
home in Blackwood, South Wales.

Mr Jones spends hours with his nails, the shortest of which is around 4mm and the longest around 75cms.

Passion: Mr Jones's wife Dorothy shared his interest and encouraged his passion up until her death four-years-ago

Exhibit: Mr Jones's wife helped him put his collection onto 32 display boards, with descriptions

On show: Mr Jones exhibits the nails at steam fairs around the country

He says his wife Dorothy 'shared my interest and encouraged my passion' up until her death four-years-ago.

She helped him put his collection onto 32 display boards, with descriptions, which he exhibits at steam fairs around the country.

He said: 'I would say 80 per cent of people walk on by but those who do stop spend a lot of time looking.

'There’s
more interest shown by woman than men - I think that may be because men
just associate them with work while women are more interested in how 
artistic they are.

Education: Mr Jones has said he hoped the collection will change the way people see nails

'Some of the nails are fascinating, it’s all the different shapes, heads and different metals.

'I could spend hours looking at them and there are still a lot of nails out there which haven’t been found.

'My nails keep me very busy but I find it very exciting, so I don’t mind spending all my time on it - I like exhibiting the nails and you make a lot of friends with them.

'I don’t drink, I don’t smoke and I don’t get out a lot - but it’s nice to meet people with similar interests to discuss nails with them.'
