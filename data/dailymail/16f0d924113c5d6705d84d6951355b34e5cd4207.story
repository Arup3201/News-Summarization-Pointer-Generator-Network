In the clear: Titus Bramble, pictured this afternoon, has been cleared of groping a woman and repeatedly sexually assaulting another at Teeside Crown Court after a four day trial

Summing up the case, Judge Peter Fox 
told the jury: 'There needs to be proof of the sexual touching of the 
girl in question (and) that girl in question at the time did not agree 
to it.'

Bramble, 30, of Wynyard near Middlesbrough, had denied all charges.

A jury of five men and seven women took just over an hour to reach a unanimous verdict.

Bramble, who was wearing a grey suit, showed little emotion as the foreman delivered a not guilty verdict for each charge.

Bramble, pictured before the verdict this morning, told jurors that one of the complainants was 'touchy feelie and flirty' and kissed him 'passionately'

He said nothing to reporters as he left court with his legal team and got into a waiting Mercedes, which sped away.

He later issued a statement, which read: 'It has been extremely tough to have this hanging over me for the last eight months.

'I am naturally delighted that the jury returned not guilty verdicts so quickly  and relieved that this awful ordeal is finally over.

'I've always said these allegations were false and untrue. I would like to thank my solicitor Phil Smith from Tuckers and my whole legal team.

'But, it has been especially hard on my family and friends. I'd like to thank them for all their love and support during a difficult time.

'My focus is now on moving forward and getting on with my career.'

During the trial Bramble told jurors that one of the complainants was 'touchy feelie and flirty' and kissed him 'passionately' as they shared a taxi from the Cross Keys nightclub.

Bramble said she kissed him and put her hand on his crotch during the journey.

He said: 'We were kissing. We kissed a couple of times passionately.

'She was touching me and putting my hand on her leg.'

But the complainant claimed he twice grabbed her hand and put it on his crotch and placed his hand between her legs, which made her 'scared'.

The taxi driver believed something was wrong and drove the pair to a police station where Bramble was arrested, the jurors were told.

Bramble's defence lawyer Ronnie Jaffa said the woman made the allegation to 'save face' after she regretted kissing him.

The other woman, who was in the Cross Keys, said she felt someone grope her bottom and turned to see Bramble.

Bramble, of Wynyard near Middlesbrough, always denied it was him.

She
 reported the incident after the other woman claimed she was assaulted 
in a taxi by the Sunderland star, which they caught in Yarm on the same 
night - September 28 last year.

The footballer, who has played for Ipswich, Newcastle and Wigan Athletic, consistently denied all charges.

Bramble's brother Tesfaye was jailed for four-and-a-half years last year for raping a 19-year-old woman at a Newcastle hotel.

Tesfaye had been out on a night out in the city with Titus before the woman was raped.
  Titus was orginally arrested along with his brother but later released without charge.
