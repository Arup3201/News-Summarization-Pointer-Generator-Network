Bayern Munich president Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has hailed Arjen Robben as 'unstoppable' when he is at the top of his game. 

And according to Rummenigge, he is exactly that at the moment. After helping Holland to the World Cup semi-finals, Robben has played a vital role in Bayern Munich's impressive start to the season.

'Arjen has been in incredible form recently,' the Bayern president told Bild. 'He has already showed what he can do at the World Cup. He was unstoppable and no defender could hold on to him. Not even Spain's Sergio Ramos.'

'It looks like he has managed to maintain this superb form. He has been amazing.'

Bayern are unbeaten and sitting pretty at the top of the Bundesliga after five wins and two draws from their first seven matches. 

Robben himself has contributed with three goals and two assists, as the champions have already extended a four-point lead over their closest rivals.

The players were even rewarded with a trip to Oktoberfest on Sunday, after their impressive 4-0 win over Hannover the previous day.
