Paul Pogba's agent has dismissed speculation that the French international will join Chelsea.

The Juventus star was 
spotted near Chelsea's Stamford Bridge stadium earlier this week 
sparking rumours that he could be set to leave the Italian champions for
 a return to the Premier League.

He
 left Manchester United in 2012 after becoming frustrated at a lack of 
first-team opportunities and joined Juventus where he has since won two 
Serie A titles.

But Pogba's agent Mino Raiola told Tuttosport: 'Everything is perfect at Juventus and no meetings are planned.'

'Paul to Chelsea? Itâ€™s just fantasy football.'

Pogba's cousin recently posted a video of the Juventus midfielder showing the kind of moves that could make him a hit on the dance floor as well as the football pitch.

On Friday, France international Pogba was shortlisted for the young player of the 2014 World Cup award alongside countryman Raphael Varane and Holland's Memphis Depay.

The 21-year-old added to his burgeoning reputation with assured displays in the middle of France's midfield as they reached the quarter-finals before losing to Germany.

On his Instagram page, FemFel, Pogba's cousin, posted the video alongside the message: 'All the rumours about #Pogba being in london meeting #ChelseaFC. Well to clear up the rumours this is what he was really doing here. #familydisco skanking'.
