A teenager who watched as her parents and 16-year-old brother were swept to their deaths while trying to save their dog from the sea is 'devastated' by the tragedy, relatives revealed today.

Olivia Kuljian, 18, was at Big Lagoon in northern California on Saturday when the dog was pulled into the water by a 'sneaker' wave - those which suddenly creep up on beachgoers - after chasing a stick.

Mary Elena Scott, 57, and Howard Gregory Kuljian, 54, both drowned trying to save the pet. Their son, Gregory James Kuljian, remains missing after going into the water and he is presumed dead.

The family's dog climbed out of the sea on its own.

'She is doing the best she can under the circumstances, but obviously she is devastated,' David Scott, Olivia's uncle, told ABC News.

'To wake up and not have a family 
anymore, it's just devastating. I can't explain it. I hope no one else 
ever has to go through this.'

Scott said that the family is waiting
until Gregory's body is recovered to make funeral arrangements. The 
family's friends in Humboldt County, California, have rushed to Olivia's aid, he said.

'She and her mother and the whole 
family were loved by the community, and I feel very good in my heart 
that they'll take care of Olivia the best they can,' he said.

The tragedy unfolded after 10-foot waves
pulled the family's beloved dog into the sea as it chased a thrown stick, and 
Gregory, known as 'Geddie' to his friends, ran in to save him.

Watching his son running towards the powerful waves, Mr Kuljian followed, said Dana Jones, a state Parks and Recreation district superintendent.

The teenager was able to get
out, but when he didn't see his father, he and his mother went back into the
water looking for him.

'Both were dragged into the ocean,' Jones added.

The couple's daughter, Olivia, and Gregory's girlfriend watched the horrifying ordeal from the beach.

A
nearby bystander called 911 at 12.40pm to report that the trio was in 
trouble - but by the time help arrived, nothing could be done.

Ms Jones said a park ranger who was alerted to the incident had to 
run a half mile to get to the beach because his car wasn't made to 
handle the terrain.

When he arrived, he wasn't able to get to them 
because of the high surf, she said.

Rescuers eventually retrieved Ms Scott's body from the water, while her husband's body washed up on the shore.

The Coast Guard deployed a helicopter 
and two motor life boats to search for the teenager, but the aerial 
search was suspended by 7pm on Saturday due to thick coastal fog.

Sadness: Students wore green, Geddie's favourite colour, in remembrance of the teenager

Helicopters remained on standby and U.S. Coast Guard officials planned to 
continue searching in the dark if the fog lifted. Two 47-foot motor life
boats were also on the scene searching for the teenager.

The search continued on Sunday with no further discoveries and by Monday, the search had been called off.

Speaking to the Associated Press, Coast Guard Lt. Bernie Garrigan added that the search was stopped as a person without a wetsuit could not survive for long in the cold water.

Signs
are posted near the beach parking lot warning families about 'sneaker 
waves' - swells that seemingly appear from nowhere and smash onto the 
beach, Garrigan said.

'Because
the beach is designed that way, when that 10-foot wall breaks, it 
surges up on the beach and surges back really fast,' he said. 'It's like
a cyclical washing machine.'

Scene: The family was overwhelmed by the waves at Big Lagoon, around 300 miles north of San Fransisco

Friends flocked to Facebook to remember the family, and launched an event, 'Wear Green for Geddie' encouraging the teenager's schoolmates to wear green to school in remembrance.

Ian Johnson, who created the page, added: 'Geddie was one of the best people on this earth. His whole family was so nice and I haven’t met or heard of a single person who didn’t like him.

'Geddie was just the funniest, nicest, most amiable person that I could ever hope to have met.'

The family lives in Freshwater, Eureka in California. Online records show that Howard Kuljian was a 2010 graduate student and teacher at the Department of Forestry at Humboldt State University.
