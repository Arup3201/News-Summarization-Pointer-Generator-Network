Bournemouth striker Tokelo Rantie missed a costly penalty as South Africa surrendered a lead against much-fancied Algeria in Mongomo.

Moments after Thuso Phala had put Bafana Bafana into the lead, Rantie was brought down in the box by Aissa Mandie, but blasted his spot-kick against the bar.

And soon after Algeria had turned the game on its head, picking up a win their play had scarcely merited.

First South Africa defender Thulani Hlatshwayo diverted a cross meant for Islam Slimani into his own net to bring the Desert Foxes level, before Napoi left back Faouzi Ghoulam completed the comeback with a powerful strike.

Slimani rounded off the win five minutes from time when his shot from the edge of the box slipped through the dive of Keet.

It was harsh on South Africa, who had defended manfully, and scored an excellent goal of their own. Phala rounded off a superb passing move, full of first time flicks and clever back-heels, with an emphatic finish.

And moments later the midfielder turned provider, a blistering run down the right ending with a ball inside for Rantie, who was brought down by Aissa Mandi inside the box,

But the miss sparked Algeria into life, and there were signs of danger when Slimani was denied by a brilliant save from Darren Keet in the South Africa goal.

The keeper did well to first save from Slimani’s backheel and then tipped the striker’s rebound onto the bar and away.

But he could do nothing about either of the goals, as Africa’s highest ranked side started their campaign with a win.

Many people’s pre-tournament favourites, Algeria had started the brighter, controlling the game and dominating possession, but created very little in the way of clear-cut chances.

Tottenham’s Nabil Bentaleb produced a good header from a free kick early on, bringing a save from Darren Keet in the South African goal, but for the most part the Desert Foxes were limited to shots from range. Ryad Mahrez, the Leicester City winger, had very little impact, and was withdrawn after an hour.

South Africa meanwhile were happy to get men behind the ball, utilizing the pace of Bournemouth striker Rantie on the break.

And it was Bofana Bofana who had the better chances in a low-key first half, Doncaster Rovers’ Dean Furman seeing his rocket strike tipped onto the crossbar, before midfielder Andile Jali had a close-range shot saved following an intricate passing move. 

Rantie, despite very little support, was a constant menace for South Africa, getting in behind the Algerian defence on several occasions, but never quite able to find the final touch.

But in the end his energetic display will be forgotten next to the missed penalty that so dented his side’s chances of progression.
