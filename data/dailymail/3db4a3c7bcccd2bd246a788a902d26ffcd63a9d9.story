Pictures have emerged of the 22-month-old boy who died after being left in a hot car outside a day care centre on Thursday. 

Noah Krespanis was found in a car parked outside a home on Acacia Drive in Kyneton, north-west of Melbourne in 31 degree heat. 

The car window was smashed in order to rescue Noah but attempts to revive him were unsuccessful.

The toddler was found unconscious by a family member while strapped in a car seat in the Toyota Hilux parked outside the home about 3pm on Thursday.

It has been reported that temperatures would have reached up to 60 degrees inside the car on the hot Summer day. 

Noah's distraught father posted an emotional social media message on Thursday, urging parents to 'cherish every day' they get to spend with their children.

Taking to his Twitter page, a devastated Mr Krespanis paid tribute to his son making a heartfelt plea to parents urging them to hug their children and 'never let them go'. 

'We lost our beautiful son today,' he wrote on the social media account on Thursday.

'Hug your children. Hug them and never let them go.' 

'I love him more every day. Forever.' he said, referring to his baby boy. 

'I'll always know I cherished every day. Every laugh, every adventure, every cuddle. Miss you noey X.'

Mr Krespanis' post comes just hours after it was revealed that Noah's mother is too distraught to speak to police.

Homicide squad Detective Senior Sergeant Shane O'Connell said the mother was present when he was found in the car, but said police investigating the incident would not speak to her for days, the Herald Sun reported.

'As you can imagine the family of this young boy are devastated by what has occurred so it's been difficult for us to try and piece together exactly what has occurred but that's something that will be the focus of our major ongoing investigation,' Det Sen Sgt O'Connell said.

'She's absolutely devastated by what has occurred. It's a very tragic set of circumstances.' 

The owner of a separate local childcare centre said they were heartbroken over the tragedy

The childcare centre where a 22-month-old boy was found dead in a hot car parked outside was privately-run and operated out of a family home

The woman who operates the family day care is part of a well-known local family and runs the business from her house, The Age reported. 

The family day care's father said his daughter was 'distraught', but said the family would not be speaking publicly until police had finished their investigation. 

There is no suggestion the childcare centre owner was involved in Noah's death.

Police are investigating whether a female relative of the 22-month-old had forgotten the child was in the vehicle.

The 22-month-old boy was apparently found by a family member

Victorian homicide detectives are trying to establish whether the woman mistakenly thought she had dropped the toddler at a childcare centre in the morning before continuing with her regular routine, the Herald Sun reported. 

Temperatures in Kyneton reached 31 degrees at the time of the tragedy. 

The woman ran a regulated family day care service through Bambini Child Care Services, a company that trains educators to take care of children from their home.

A spokeswoman for Family Day Care Australia, of which Bambini is a member, said: 'Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with the family and all those affected by this tragedy.'

They refused to comment on any other details while police were conducting inquiries. 

The owner of a separate local business - Kyneton Family Day Care - posted on her Facebook page: 'The only information I can give regarding the accident in Kyneton this afternoon is that I am absolutely heartbroken for the family and my friend.'

Inspector Ryan Irwin said at the scene: 'I understand the boy has been found by a family member and paramedics were called and obviously there were attempts made to try and revive the child.'

Insp Irwin said homicide squad detectives would oversee the investigation, and called the incident an 'absolute tragedy'. 

'We're devastated,' Inspector Irwin said, according to the Herald Sun.

'[The family are] devastated, absolutely devastated and we're still trying to track some family members down to actually notify them.'   

Officers were still at the scene on Acacia Drive in Kyneton, 100km north-west of Melbourne hours after the awful discovery. 

Neighbours of the house the baby boy was found outside said the residency doubled as a childcare centre, the ABC reported.

The suburb, which is about 100km north-west of Melbourne, recorded temperatures of 31 degrees

Homicide detectives have been called into the investigation but this is 'common procedure' according to police. 

Ambulance Victoria would not comment on the latest case, but has issued repeated warnings against leaving children in cars.

In the first five weeks of the year, paramedics were called to 200 cases.

Most recently, a young girl had to be rushed to the Royal Children's Hospital after being locked in a hot vehicle at Maribyrnong, 4km west of Melbourne, for just half an hour after her mother couldn't open the doors.

'The girl was sweating profusely and her clothes were drenched, so there was certainly potential for it to quickly become life threatening,' advanced life support paramedic Ben Dalton said.

'The MFB smashed a window to get the girl out of the car.' 

It comes after Ambulance Victoria were called in to help at least six young children locked in hot cars in separate incidents last week, and a total of 200 children in the first five weeks of 2015

Mr Dalton said two children have died in the last few years after being left in hot cars in Victoria, and it's frustrating the message is not getting through.

'Children can't regulate their body temperature like adults can, which puts them at significant risk,' he said.

'It's never okay to leave a child locked in a car, even for a minute or two.' 

The state government said it will increase penalties for leaving children in hot cars, with fines up to $3700 and jail time increased from three months to six months.
