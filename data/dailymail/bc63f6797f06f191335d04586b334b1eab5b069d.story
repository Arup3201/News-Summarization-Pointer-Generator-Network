He has already given himself Wolverine's claws and Magneto's gravity defying boots.

Now British inventor Colin Furze has unveiled his latest attempt to give himself X-Men superpowers - with a wrist mounted flame thrower.

It can produce flames up to 12 metres long.

The system is mounted in a backpack, with controls on each wrist.

Propane cylinders used for a blowtorch provide the gas.

It is used to fill a reservoir which allows a far larger flame to be created.

To operate the system, the wearer flicks their wrist to start a pilot flame, then their other wrist to light the gas.

Colin Furze, a 34 year old plumber from Lincolnshire said the fire-thrower was a natural choice for this third attempt to give himself X-Men powers.

'I just had to do Pyro as I seem to have a connection with fire,' he said.

'After working with some special effects guys on a TV pilot they showed me a great way of creating a gas powered device that was safe and controllable.

'The result is a real life super hero -  well, as close as i could get.'

The system is mounted in a backpack, with controls on each wrist.

'I like the idea of being able to shoot flames from my wrist,' said Furze.

Previous projects have also been a big success for Furze.

In ‘X-Men: Days of Future Past’, super-villain Magneto is shown ripping a baseball stadium from its foundation and levitating it off the ground.

Inspired by this incredible power, a plumber from Lincolnshire has attempted to recreate this metal-controlling power using home-made magnetic shoes.

Colin Furze, 34, spent a week creating the strange gadget, which allow him to walk upside down along metal ceilings.

Mr Furze built the magnet in the shoes
 using a microwave transformer, with one of the coils removed, and 
hooking it up to a car battery.

He then placed the transformer on a shoe shaped plate and clamped his foot to it.

He has attached straps to the shoes with switches which power the flow of electricity and enable him to walk.

The father-of-one said he could potentially use his mad invention to scale skyscrapers, instead of taking the lift.

‘The shoes are great fun but it is rather bizarre trying to walk upside down, you have to really force your feet on to the ceiling,’ said Mr Furze, who lives in Stamford, Lincolnshire.

‘It’s rather nerve-racking because if the electricity fails the magnets won’t work and I will fall.

An X-Men fan has invented his own magnetic shoes which help him to walk upside down. Colin Furze, 34, spent a week creating the amazing shoes after being inspired by comic book character Magneto, who can move metal with his mind

‘I think the shoes could be useful for beating the queues at a railway station by walking over the top of everyone’s heads or running along the side of buildings in busy shopping streets.’

'The shoes will hold me with 12 volts of power, but it can really hurt your back,' said Mr Furze

In a hilarious video, he demonstrates his unsuccessful attempts at learning to walk without crashing to the floor.

‘The shoes will hold me with 12 volts of power, but it can really hurt your back,’ added Mr Furze.

‘My wife Charlotte was a bit surprised when she saw me hanging upside down from the ceiling.’

This isn’t Mr Furze’s first foray into creating bizarre contraptions. The plumber recently invented a pair of Wolverine-inspired claws complete with 12 inch (30cm) stainless steel blades.

Not only do they automatically extend and retract, like Hugh Jackman’s claws in X-Men, they are so sharp they have been used to slice watermelon and rip card from a distance.

Mr Furze has also previously built a turbojet engine, vacuum shoes and hacked a mobility scooter.
