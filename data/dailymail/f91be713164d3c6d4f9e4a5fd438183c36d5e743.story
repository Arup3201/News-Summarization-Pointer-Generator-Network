Chewing his favorite toy and surrounded by devastated police officers, this is the heartbreaking tribute made to a veteran K-9 just before he was put down.

The nine-year-old German shepherd named Judge was driven to Swedesboro Animal Hospital in Woolwich Township, New Jersey on roads flanked by saluting canine cops.

His handlers questioned whether he would be strong enough to make it to the door, following years of deteriorating health problems.

Standing tall: Officers knew the nine-year-old would be able to walk inside when he bit down on his favorite toy - which is used during canine training 

But his tight squeeze on the sleeve he used while he was being trained proved he had enough energy for one final walk. 

Vets and specialists surprised the West Deptford Police department by lining up inside the clinic. According to Gloucester County Online, one of them was sobbing as Judge passed. 

He was then taken into a treatment room - and was put to sleep.  

Judge’s work aided in the arrest of 152 people, the seizure of three vehicles, the removal of three handguns from the streets, drug seizures, and the confiscation of more than $47,000 in cash, said police.

He was recruited in 2007 and was a key fixture in the department until he was forced to retire in 2013 because of issues with his teeth. 

Last June however, his health started to get worse - suffering from vomiting, hair loss and bloating.

He was taken to see a vet, who found several large masses over his body. After that cops made the difficult decision to end his life.

More than than $13,000 was raised in one day to help pay for the German Shepherd dog’s mountain of medical bills last year, but it was not enough to save him. 

Touching: Judge, with his teeth embedded in the sleeve, was forced to retire in August 2013
