Being overweight in your 30s triples the risk of dementia in later life, warn researchers.

A new study shows that being fat in your ‘midlife’ years is likely to accelerate the loss of memory and other brain skills.

Oxford University researchers found the age at which a person is obese is a key factor – with the highest risk of developing dementia found in those who are very overweight in their 30s.

They say the risk of dementia may be raised or lowered depending on the age when weight gain runs out of control.

Being fat in your 'midlife' years increases the risk of dementia, a new study has shown

The increased risk of dementia fell the later in life obesity was diagnosed, according to the study of almost half a million people. Those who were obese past age 70 were no more likely to develop dementia than those who were not obese.

The researchers looked at English hospital records from 1999-2011, during which 451,232 of those admitted to hospital were diagnosed with obesity.

The small time span means that although only 19 people who were obese in their 30s in the study went on to develop dementia, they did so at a relatively young age – while still in their 40s or early 50s.

The rate was more than three times higher than would be expected by this age, when compared to the rates for other age groups. For those in their 40s, the equivalent extra risk fell to 70 per cent, for those in their 50s it dropped to 50 per cent, while those in their 60s had a 40 per cent extra risk, according to the study published online in the Postgraduate Medical Journal.

Obese people in their 70s were neither more or less at risk of developing dementia, while those in their 80s were 22 per cent less likely to develop the disease.

Study leader Professor Michael Goldacre, of Oxford University, said: ‘Despite the study limitations, there is nonetheless an age effect that is striking and consistent with other studies. It cannot be lightly ignored, given the prevalence and importance of both obesity and dementia.’

Shops are stocking school uniforms in size XXXXXXXXL – in an ‘appalling’ sign of the growing childhood obesity crisis.

It comes as researchers warn the age at which someone is obese is a key factor in the risk of developing dementia.

Blazers up to a 56in chest and trousers up to a 46in waist are available from stockists ahead of the school year – nearly double the national average waist size for an 11-year-old.

The latest government figures reveal one in ten reception pupils and one in five Year 6 students are classed as obese.

Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said their research showed that in the next 15 to 20 years, 50 per cent of the UK population will be overweight.

He said: ‘It really is an appalling situation we find ourselves in and very disturbing that we are seeing school uniforms going up to waist sizes of 50 inches.

‘Unfortunately, a significant amount of adults do not eat properly and this is passed down to their  children.

Something drastic needs to be done to combat this.’

Nationally the average waist size of 11-year-old boys and girls is 27.5in – which is 3in more than in 1978 for boys and 4in more for girls.

The obesity crisis has seen supersize school uniforms flying off the shelves, with PE kits also available in sizes up to XXL.

The growing concerns for Britain’s children are highlighted by NHS guidelines that suggest even adult men with a waist of 37in or more could experience weight-related health problems.

Lisa Phillis, sales director at supplier Just School Wear in Sherwood, Nottinghamshire, said: ‘Over the past five years we have been supplying many more larger uniforms.

‘A few years ago we were seeing average waist sizes of 26 to 28in.

‘Now the norm is around 30in for a senior boy. But we do have up to 46in.'

Experts do not know exactly why obesity impacts on the risk of dementia, although hardening of the arteries and high blood pressure play a role. Previous research has also shown that abdominal obesity has a particularly harmful effect on the brain, probably because it is ‘metabolically active’, releasing more of the acids that raise heart disease risk, along with factors that increase blood pressure and blood sugar.

Dr Clare Walton, of the Alzheimer’s Society charity, said: ‘The finding that people who are obese in their 30s are three times more likely to get dementia is striking, but it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from a study where only 19 of the 451,232 people observed were obese in their 30s and went on to develop dementia. Given the growing body of evidence that being overweight in mid-life rather than in later years seems to be the bigger risk factor for dementia, it is never too early to start making healthy lifestyle choices.’

Dr Eric Karran, director of research at the Alzheimer’s Research UK charity, added: ‘One limitation of the study is that the data for obesity came from hospital admissions so it is hard to gauge the risk in people who were obese but did not need to be hospitalised.’
