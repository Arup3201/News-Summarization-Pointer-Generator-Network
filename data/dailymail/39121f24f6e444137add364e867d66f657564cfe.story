US Border Patrol agents on Tuesday captured a boat that was trying to smuggle 20 people into San Diego - a day after another large group of illegal immigrants successfully landed on a city beach.

The federal agency said an aircraft spotted the 30-foot panga vessel at around 1am Tuesday in deep water about 30 miles off the coast of Del Mar in San Diego County.

The boat finally was stopped by marine border patrol agents about 12 miles from Oceanside at 2.30am.

Unwelcome guests: Border agents thwarted a human smuggling operation off the coast of San Diego County early Tuesday, arresting 20 people trying to enter the country illegally

Thirteen men and seven women between the ages of 20 and 51, most of them from Mexico, were detained for trying to enter the country illegally, reported NBC San Diego.

One member of the group was from El Salvador and two others from Guatemala.

Authorities said they plan to charge two of the male suspects with human smuggling.

The incident came less than 24 hours after another modest-size fishing boat known as panga landed on Mission Beach, just north of Belmont Park.

Witnesses reported seeing 21 people, among them two women, dressed all in black bolting from the boat and over a sea wall. 

Surveillance cameras in the area captured the illegal immigrants, many of them soaking wet, fleeing into alleyways near the beach just before 7am.

Seven of the suspects, all Mexican citizens, were captured by federal agents. The rest remained at large as of early Saturday morning.

The illegal aliens landed in this red panga, where federal agents discovered 17 life vests 

Bill Wu, from Mission Beach, told NBC San Diego it appeared like the undocumented men and women had help on shore.

‘I guess there was somebody on the inside here that was supplying them with clothing, and they went down to Mission Boulevard and changed clothes,’ Wu said.

When border Patrol agents examined the red panga vessel, they found 17 discarded life vests inside.
