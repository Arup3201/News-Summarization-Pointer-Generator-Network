A Spitfire crash-landed today, closing a major airport and causing flight delays.

The vintage aircraft, famed for its use by the RAF during the Second World War, blew its front wheel as it touched down at East Midlands Airport.

While the aircraft’s pilot, the only person on board, emerged unscathed, his plane was stranded on the runway.

Other flights approaching had to be diverted to nearby Birmingham, as emergency crews cleared the obstruction.

News of the crash caused bewilderment, with many joking that they thought they had mistakenly been given news from more than half a century ago.

Author Jenny Colgan wrote on Twitter: ‘PLEASE let it be time travel.’

Rob Kerry added: ‘They need to get some newer planes up norf!’

The historic war plane – believed to be a Rolls Royce Spitfire G-RRGN from the airport’s private collection - suffered landing gear failure when it touched down on the runway just after 3.20pm today.

Flights out of East Midlands Airport had to be suspended for three-and-a-half hours while others were diverted to nearby Birmingham International.

Passengers spoke of how the crash caused ‘bedlam’, forcing inconvenient diversions.

One, named Sarah, had her flight from Belfast diverted to Birmingham.

She wrote online: ‘Flight has been diverted to Birmingham. What a nightmare! Vintage Spitfire emergency landing. Everything has been diverted to here. It is bedlam.’

A spokeswoman for the airport said: ‘The undercarriage of the plane came off after it landed.

‘We have our own on-site fire service - which is a standard regulation - who dealt with the incident swiftly.

‘All flights had to be suspended while the aircraft was recovered from the runway. There were no injuries and flights were diverted to Birmingham in the meantime.’

A spokeswoman for Leicestershire Police added: ‘We were notified by the fire service of the incident but didn't attend.

‘We were called at 3.22pm with a report of an aircraft that had suffered an undercarriage failure.’

Plane spotter Edward Cockson, who witnessed the incident, said: 'I was looking at the plane coming in from the motorway end and all of a sudden there was loads of blue lights.

'I got my binoculars out and saw that it had landed on the runway. It was tilted forward but it was intact.

'Radio hams then picked up messages from the airport that said the pilot was fine. There was a couple of fire engines but no fire.

'A couple of Canadian visitors had been watching planes coming in and taking off and they were amazed when I told them the plane involved was a Spitfire.'

The UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said it was aware of the incident and had launched an investigation.

The plane was described by an EMA spokesman as a Rolls-Royce Spitfire, number PS853, based at the airport.

It was originally an unarmed, 
high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft, one of a batch of 79 Mk XIXs 
built at Supermarine, Southampton.

The Mk XIX was powered by the 2,050 
hp Griffon 65 or 66 and represents the pinnacle of the Spitfire’s 
development in terms of speed and altitude capability with a top speed 
of 446mph and a ceiling of 42,000ft.

PS853 was delivered to the Central 
Photographic Reconnaissance Unit at RAF Benson on 13th January 1945, 
before moving to Belgium and Holland.

The aircraft was engaged on active 
service with 16 Squadron up until the end of the war and participated in
'Operation Crossbow' to detect V1 and V2 'vengeance weapon' launch 
sites.

At the end of the war it remained on duty in Germany until March1946 when it returned to the UK and was placed in storage.

In 1950, PS853 was one of several Mk XIX Spitfires selected for conversion to conduct meteorological research.

It flew its last official sortie on 10th June 1957 and retired into ceremonial and display duties to form the RAF’s Historic Aircraft Flight, the forerunner of today’s Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF).

In 1996, Rolls-Royce bought PS853 to replace the original Rolls-Royce Spitfire XIV, G-ALGT which had been destroyed in a crash in 1992.

The Rolls-Royce Spitfire, as PS853 is now popularly known, has become widely recognised as an ambassador for Rolls-Royce appearing at air displays and charity events.

The aircraft is based in a dedicated hangar at East Midlands Airport, near Derby. It can usually be seen around the display circuit between April and October and during the winter months the aircraft undergoes an annual maintenance inspection programme.
