Broadchurch. It's a name that has gripped a nation for two months. Tautly plotted, brilliantly acted, the eight-part murder mystery reaches its climax at 9pm tonight with a special 65-minute denouement.

ITV executives have kept the final episode sealed off like a crime scene — no journalists have been allowed to see previews. But the whole country is speculating over who killed 11-year-old Danny Latimer, the boy found strangled at the foot of cliffs on the beach of a rural Dorset town.

Nearly ten million viewers are addicted to this slow-burning drama. It's been acclaimed as the best story to hit our screens since the original run of The Killing, the Danish crime series that has proved a heavy influence on Broadchurch. Both examine the impact on a close-knit family when a child is killed and how the deepest buried secrets will bubble up to the surface.

Who dunnit? The whole country is speculating over who killed 11-year-old Danny Latimer in Broadchurch

But the British show adds a unique psychological layer: the whole community is ripped apart by the tragedy. Neighbours stare at each other in suspicion, children are kept indoors by anxious parents, local businesses struggle to stay afloat, innocent people become scapegoats, journalists make the town a byword for child murder.

If you haven't succumbed to the dark fascination of Broadchurch, you've been missing out on a TV event that's the equal of that great Dallas cliffhanger Who Shot JR?

But even if you've been glued to every episode, it's unlikely you've grasped all the clues or followed every undercurrent of enmity. The show defies genres. Much of the drama focuses on Detective Inspector Alex Hardy (David Tennant) and his sergeant, vulnerable and trusting Ellie Miller, played by Olivia Colman, but this is no mere police procedural.

Unlike CSI, for instance, Broadchurch does not follow the police team through every painstaking step of the investigation and interviews.

Nor is this a serial killer drama where a fresh body turns up before every set of adverts. There has been one murder, and that is unbearable enough.

Thrilling cliffhanger: Mark Latimer and Nige Carter are just two of the characters in the frame for murder

The
 crime won't be unravelled by some superhuman sleuth, a Sherlock or a 
Morse. And neither is this a cop thriller, in the mould of Kiefer 
Sutherland's 24 franchise.

The
 only fight-and-chase scene in Broadchurch ended when Alex Hardy, 
Tennant's character, was felled by heart arrhythmia and was rushed to 
hospital. It's all a far cry from Starsky & Hutch.

Writer
 and creator Chris Chibnall, who has previously worked on Doctor Who and
 Law And Order: UK, claims the series was not conceived as a whodunnit: 
'It's always been about community — places where people know each 
other's business.

'The murder of a child is more powerful in such a community, where you can clearly demonstrate the impact of a terrible event.'

That's the point: like many small towns across Britain, everyone in Broadchurch knows everyone else.

Or they thought they did

Suspects: Susan Wright, Joe and Rev Coates are also under the viewer's murder mystery spotlight

As the investigation has unravelled, suspicion has been thrown on all the inhabitants.

Sergeant Ellie Miller's 11-year-old son, Tom, knew the victim well, and now he's frantically trying to delete information from his phone and laptop.

The adults all thought that Tom was a close friend of the murdered boy, but it transpires the pair were enemies. Tom goes out of his way to tell the dead boy's sister Chloe: 'I hated him!'

Worse still, Ellie's partner Joe might not be the harmless house-husband he seemed to be.

Gripping: Broadchurch has provided the most thrilling cliffhanger since the 'Who shot JR' storyline in Dallas

Alex Hardy has been warning Ellie from the start that she can't afford to trust anyone.

If Joe turns out to be the killer, the whole series will turn on one crucial line — a question Detective Sergeant Miller asked in the CID interrogation room as she quizzed a female suspect, Susan Wright.

Wright, played by the superb Pauline Quirke, revealed her own husband had abused and murdered their daughter.

Ellie could not fully believe Wright's story, and accused her: 'How could you not know what was happening under your own roof?'

The implication was like a silent scream: has Ellie's husband, without her knowledge, been abusing their son? And did Danny die because he knew too much?

For weeks it seemed certain Quirke's character was involved in the murder. But though last Monday we learned she was the first to find the body — and actually stood beside it, smoking cigarettes — it seems she was shielding a different secret . . . she is the biological mother of the town's nastiest character, poacher Nige Carter.

Violent, deceitful, twisting, thieving . . . that's Carter on a good day. He works as a plumber's mate for Danny Latimer's father, Mark, and supplements his income by hunting pheasants with his crossbow. What he forgot to mention to the police, and to the Latimers, is that he used to take Danny poaching with him.

Carter lied to the police from the outset, though he says he did it to help Mark Latimer with his alibi. And that prised open another secret: the happy marriage between Danny's parents was a sham.

On the night his son died, Mark was having a sexual assignation with the local hotelier, Australian Becca Fisher.

Head starting to spin? Don't worry. That's what the programme makers want — and it all adds to the intrigue.

High standard: The highly-acclaimed Danish drama The Killing proved a heavy influence on Broadchurch

Hotelier Becca is no better than she ought to be: apart from sleeping with married men, she procures drugs for hotel guests.

There are undertones of drug crime throughout the series: 15-year-old Chloe Latimer's older boyfriend is the local dealer.

But Mark's infidelity has shocked everyone. He's the town's Mr Cheerful, liked by all.

In a dramatic early scene, the camera followed Mark through the town in a technically brilliant tracking shot, the lens never leaving him as he greeted a string of friends.

The subtext was plain: everyone knew 
Mark, everyone trusted Mark and Mark had a different face for everyone. 
He could be charming, matey, jokey, respectful, flirty and curt, 
switching between personalities like settings on a dial.

Another
 character who wears a mask is the Rev Paul Coates —played by Arthur 
Darvill, David Tennant's former co-star from Doctor Who (he played Rory 
Williams, Amy Pond's fiance). The vicar has a hidden past. He claims to 
be on the side of the angels, but he has his demons — he is a recovering
 alcoholic and an insomniac who wanders the town by night.

Weaselling his way into the Latimer family, as if he's feeding on their anguish, Coates has even managed to appoint himself as their marriage guidance counsellor, despite the fact neither of them is religious.

In one chilling scene, DI Hardy saw Coates sitting with 11-year-old Tom Miller, with his hand on the boy's knee.

To make the mystery still more convoluted, there's the telephone engineer who claims to be receiving psychic messages from Danny Latimer beyond the grave, the manipulative young journalist exploiting the story to boost his career and the newsagent with a past conviction for sex crimes who killed himself after town vigilantes set upon him.

At the centre of the town's anguish is Danny's mother, the only character who seems above suspicion. Beth Latimer was just 15 when she and Mark got together, and she is still young — the grief of actress Jodie Whittaker has made the show compelling. We are desperate to know who killed Danny, not because we're afraid he (or she) will strike again, but because Beth's life will be in tatters until the criminal is found.

Star: David Tennant has won plaudits for his role in Broachurch

But it's not only the psychological tension that has us enthralled.

Tennant's character has been falling apart throughout the series: he began as a cynical pro and now he's driving himself to collapse, clutching at anything he can reach.

He's haunted by dreams where he sees the suspects' faces as they stand at the sea's edge, and he's twice been rushed to hospital after cardiac incidents — only to discharge himself hours later.

Alex Hardy's illness could have blinded him to the most obvious clue of all, one flashed in front of our faces at the start of every episode.

We first met this Glaswegian policeman with the granite exterior and the weak heart in a clifftop field overlooking the English Channel. He was investigating a petty crime: criminals had cut the barbed wire fence and syphoned diesel off from a tractor.

Last week Nige the poacher admitted he was the fuel thief.

 Joe Miller: 4/7
Tom Miller: 3/1
Rev Paul Coates: 9/2
Oliver Stevens: 8/1
Nigel Carter: 10/1
Steve Connelly: 10/1
Jack Marshall: 14/1
Mark Latimer: 20/1
Dean Thomas: 22/1
Becca Fisher: 25/1
Susan Wright: 33/1

But in the credit sequence at the start of each episode, we see Danny, with red liquid dripping from his fingers. It looks like blood. . . but the diesel used in agricultural vehicles contains a red dye, too. And since the boy was strangled, why would his hand be bleeding?

Now Tennant's troubled policeman is dragging himself to the conclusion, fighting blackouts, nightmares and panic attacks.

There seems no doubt that Danny's killer will be revealed tonight. And if you want to twist my arm, my money isn't on a single killer — I believe it's a conspiracy.

But there's another question, just as crucial, below the surface.

Detective Inspector Alex Hardy will solve this case. But will it prove the death of him?
