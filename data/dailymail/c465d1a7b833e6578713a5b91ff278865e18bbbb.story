Following a new report that 29per cent of Americans are trying to cut back on gluten, a woman with celiac disease has launched a plea for people to stop giving it up without a viable medical reason.

Elissa Strauss, who was diagnosed with the immune disease 14 years ago, explains that a gluten-free diet is not as healthy - or slimming - as it is hyped up to be.

'I have met many a celiac over the years,' the blogger wrote on Jezebel. 'And I promise we wouldn't all pass your supermarket tabloids "bikini body" test.'

Just a fad? As 29per cent of Americans cut back on gluten, Elissa Strauss - who was diagnosed with celiac disease 14 years ago - explains that the trendy diet is not worthy of all the hype

In fact, the University of Wisconsin graduate says that a gluten-free diet can actually lead to weight gain, since a lot of gluten-free foods are higher in fat to substitute the missing gluten.

But it has its staunch advocates, including high-profile stars such as Miley Cyrus and Gwyneth Paltrow, who openly discuss the benefits of cutting out grains such as wheat, barley and rye.

Fashion writer Lauren Sherman, who has been gluten-free for over a year now, is a huge fan of her new lifestyle.

She told MailOnline that she first began avoiding gluten following a doctor's recommendation.

And now, 'I might not be a size four, but my life has improved tremendously,' she said of the diet.

The writer, who noticed she was having stomach issues when she ate wheat, says these days she just sticks to carbohydrates like quinoa and brown rice.

Even though Ms Sherman does not suffer from celiac disease, she says eating wheat does make her feel 'pretty crappy'.

Still, Elissa Strauss insists that going gluten-free 'is not an almond flour paved path to the GOOP holy trifecta of increased energy, a dewy complexion and perfectly fitting skinny jeans.'

Instead, using the diet as an excuse to lose weight only has a damaging effect on people who actually suffer from the disease.

She explains that ever since gluten-free 
dieting has become trendy, 'Waiters, thinking I am just another 
ankle-boot wearing Gwyneth wannabe, no longer take me seriously.'

What's more, people who give up gluten when they don't need to could be cutting out healthy foods from their diet.

'Fiber is one of the most important things you can eat for health's sake,' she says, adding that a slice of whole wheat bread is 'by no means worse for you than a slice of teff, garbanzo bean and brown rice fiber bread.'

And while celebrities can afford to stock up on expense gluten-free goods, for others it is not so easy.

According to the Dalhousie Medical 
School in Canada, gluten-free foods cost on average 242per cent more 
than the gluten-containing versions,

Indeed, Ms Strauss notes that it is normal for her to shell out $12 for one whole-grain gluten-free loaf of bread.

But there is also a growing concern that people are using a gluten allergy to mask their real eating disorders.

While a recent study by the NPD group 
shows that 29% of Americans are trying to cut back on gluten, under one 
per cent of the population actually suffers from celiac disease.

'I might not be a size four, but my life has improved tremendously since going gluten-free'

Since the diet has recently been touted a way to lose weight, it would appear many are trying it out solely for this reason.

In any case, there is no doubt that avoiding certain food ingredients goes in cycles, and gluten seems to be the trend of today.

In fact, the gluten-free movement is number two on TIME's top ten food trends for 2012.

'Gluten is the pariah ingredient du jour,' says an article in the magazine. 'And there are a lot of healthy people shelling out big bucks for gluten-free food they probably donâ€™t need.'

But for real sufferers of celiac disease, the diet is a serious lifetime commitment, not just a temporary fad.

'A little dusting of flour on a piece of flounder equals a few days in bed for me,' says Ms Strauss.
