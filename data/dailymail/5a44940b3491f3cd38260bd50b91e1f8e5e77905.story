Footage of a wolf stalking through the hall of a Sochi hotel has been revealed to be an elaborate hoax set up by Jimmy Kimmel and U.S. Olympic luger Kate Hansen.

Hansen had posted a clip online, labeled Epix#SochiFail: Wolf in my hall, which appeared to show a wild animal padding around a corridor.

But according to Inside Edition, the video was a joke set up between Kimmel and the 21-year-old athlete, who is due to appear on his show tonight.

Hansen, who came

Beyonce songs, posted the video on YouTube yesterday, where it has been 
seen more than a million times.

Many of those who viewed the 17-second clip had doubts from the start, pointing out that the wolf looked more like a husky.

YouTube user Justin Anderson said: 
‘That is a husky not a wolf. A wolf would be much larger and way more 
alert about its surroundings.’

 2) a husky (The canine is bigger than a husky ), 3) Alaskan malamute 
cross (probably).'

The wolf hoax was confirmed by Sandy Caligiore, a publicist for the United States Luge Association.

It is likely to be discussed by Hansen and Kimmel when she Skypes the comedian on his late show tonight.
