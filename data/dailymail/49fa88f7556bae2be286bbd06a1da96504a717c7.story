'Kind, innocent and friendly nature': Learning-disabled Faruk Ali was attacked as he helped binmen collect rubbish from his street in Luton, Bedfordshire

A police officer who allegedly punched an autistic man for helping to put out the bins is to face charges of racially aggravated assault.

Faruk Ali, 33, who has had learning difficulties and severe autism since childhood, was helping binmen collect rubbish outside his home when his family say he was the victim of a ‘savage attack’.

They claim a uniformed officer beat up the vulnerable victim, hurling him into wheelie bins and pinning him down before chasing him inside his home in Luton, Bedfordshire.

According to his family, the alleged attack on Mr Ali continued inside, where one of the two officers present is accused of punching him.

The officers from Bedfordshire Police are said to have claimed they thought he was a robber, even though Mr Ali was wearing a pair of slippers and a badge on his coat to alert people to his condition as he helped refuse collectors, which he has done for a number of years.

Two constables are now facing charges over the alleged racially motivated attack.

PC Christopher Thomas, 33, from Welwyn Garden City has been summonsed to court where he will be formally charged with racially aggravated assault as well as a second charge of assault, perverting the course of justice and misconduct in public office.

His colleague, PC Christopher Pitts, 39, from Bedford, has been summonsed in relation to charges of perverting the course of justice and misconduct in public office.

The move comes after the force apologised to the family and ordered an independent investigation by Leicestershire Police, which is being supervised by the police watchdog.

Bedfordshire Chief Constable Colette Paul wrote an open letter telling of her ‘sadness’ at the ‘considerable distress’ the incident had caused Mr Ali.

It later emerged in a public meeting held by his family that Mr Ali had been the victim of a similar incident involving the police in 2011, again near his home.

According to his family, Mr Ali likes routine and enjoys helps the binmen every Thursday.

His sister Husna Begum, has described how she was awoken by banging noises and the sound of him screaming ‘no’ on the morning of February 20 this year.

She said she jumped out of bed and saw a man dragging him across the floor and punching him.

The alleged attack was also witnessed by neighbours.

One witness, Musthafa Hussain recalled: ‘They dragged him, they punched him. They held him hard.

‘It was outrageous.’

Days later, the victim’s brother Kodor Ali told their local newspaper: ‘The police said they thought he was going to rob the house. That’s the only explanation given.

‘Every Thursday, Faruk would wake up early to take the bins out for collection and would help the bin man to bring them back to the neighbours’ doorstep.

‘He has been doing this for a number of years and all the neighbours are very well aware of his kind, innocent and friendly nature.

‘I don’t understand how this character could be mistaken for a person who is trying to rob a house.’

'Traumatised': A photograph shows the bruising Mr Ali suffered to his neck as a result of the attack

His younger brother Dhobir, 31, added: ‘The family has been traumatised by the whole experience. Faruk hasn't actually recovered yet, he's still traumatised.

‘He is scared to leave the house, he has become more anxious and agitated and he is terrified every time he sees the police.

‘When he came in the house with the police behind him I saw the bruises and cuts and straight away knew what had happened to him.

‘Why did the police use such force?

‘They said he looked suspicious but he was wearing slippers at the time and he was wearing a big coat.’

Yesterday a spokesman for the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said: ‘It has been announced today by the CPS that two officers from Bedfordshire Police are to be summonsed to appear in court in connection with the assault.

‘Christopher Thomas, who is 33 and from Welwyn Garden City, has been summonsed in relation to charges of racially aggravated assault; assault, perverting the course of justice and misconduct in public office.

‘Christopher Pitts, who is 39 and from Bedford, has been summonsed in relation to charges of perverting the course of justice and misconduct in public office.’

Other injuries: Mr Ali's family say although he has physically recovered, he has been left traumatised by the experience. He is scared to leave the house, anxious and agitated and terrified every time he sees police

The investigation by Leicestershire Police remains ongoing.

A spokesman for Bedfordshire Police said both officers had been suspended, adding: ‘In direct response to family and community concerns Bedfordshire’s Chief Constable, Colette Paul, arranged for the investigation to be undertaken by Leicestershire Police, to ensure a transparent investigation by a team unconnected to Bedfordshire.

‘This was to ensure the community was reassured that the investigation was as thorough and as impartial as it possibly could be.’

The two constables will appear at Aylesbury Magistrates’ Court on September 1 when they will be formally charged.
