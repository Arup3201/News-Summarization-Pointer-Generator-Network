Peter Frankland, 48, suffered a cardiac arrest during a triathlon and died in hospital 10 days later

A super-fit father has died while taking part in a charity triathlon.

Peter Frankland, 48, lost consciousness during the Virgin Active event in London last month and died in hospital 10 days later

Mr Frankland, a solicitor, was taking part in the triathlon to raise money for men's health charities.

Described as a fitness fanatic, he got into difficulties while swimming in the Royal Victoria Docks in Newham.

Paramedics tried to resuscitate him and he was put on a life-support machine. 

But he died last Wednesday surrounded by 
friends and family, including his wife Felicity, a scientist, and the couple's 14-year-old daughter.

Mrs Frankland, 49, today described her husband's death as an 'utter shock'. 

She told the Evening Standard: 'He was an incredibly fit person - he cycled eight miles to work every day, and if he ever had to go in by Tube he would run home and even did the London Marathon last year.

'It is a complete and utter shock. You can’t comprehend what a shock it is. I still think he is going to walk through the door, but obviously he is not.'

She added that a post-mortem examination revealed he suffered a cardiac arrest.

'His heart stopped for some reason - but there was nothing wrong with his heart. It was not a heart attack. He had a cardiac arrest but I don’t think we will ever know why.'

She added that her husband's father had also died at quite a young age. 

Mr Franklin's friend and swimming partner Jake Morgan agreed that he had been in good health - and didn't have an 'ounce of fat on him'. He added: 'If it can happen to him, it can happen to anyone.'
