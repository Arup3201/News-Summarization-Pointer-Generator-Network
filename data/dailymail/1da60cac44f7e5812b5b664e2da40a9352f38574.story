Unhappy: Matthew Quinn, pictured with his girlfriend Jacqueline Scott, wants to sue the producers of The Jeremy Kyle Show for making him 'look bad'

A violent boyfriend who appeared on The Jeremy Kyle Show to confront the girlfriends he tormented is now trying to sue the producers for making him 'look bad'.

Matthew Quinn, 25, went on the ITV show twice - his first appearance on an episode called 'You'll beat and abandon your fiancee... just like you did me!' and the second time as part of a love-triangle.

But the serial-womaniser believes the editing of his latest appearance on the show - called 'Ex, accept I'm with your best friend and get out our house!' - vilified him and he is now trying to find a lawyer to take on his case.

The part-time singer told the Daily Record: 'It was all supposed to be about me confronting my ex. Then Jeremy started having a go at me and I was like, "What the hell".

'I
 didn’t think I would be portrayed like that. I’m looking for 
compensation. If they want to settle out of court, I’ll settle out of 
court. If they want to humiliate themselves, they can be my guest and go
 to court.'

Quinn,
 who has been engaged four times in the last three years, first appeared
 on The Jeremy Kyle Show on an episode called 'You'll beat and abandon 
your fiancee... just like you did me!' in April 2012 when he proposed to
 his then girlfriend Alice Peters.

His
 appearance came shortly after he was given a two-and-a-half year 
Community Payback Order at court for punching Ms Peters in the head in 
January 2012. He will be sentenced this month for breaching the order.

Ms Peters last night expressed her disgust at Quinn's attempt to get money off the back of his appearances on the show.

She
 told the Record: 'He is the lowest of the low. I lived in fear of him. 
It is a scandal he is trying to get money because of the way he beats up
 women.'

Ms Peters says she was attacked by 
Quinn on a weekly basis during their relationship and they went on The 
Jeremy Kyle Show to address his violent outbursts.

'Vilified': Matthew Quinn, 25, has twice appeared on The Jeremy Kyle 
Show. He is pictured on his most recent appearance in a February 
episode entitled: 'Ex, accept I'm with your best friend and get out of 
our house!'

Claims: Quinn, pictured second from the right, says he only went on the show for a second time in February to confront his ex girlfriend Laura Lynskey, pictured left, over cheating on him but was instead made out to be the 'bad one'

His
 first fiancee Sonja Colognori, who he dated for two months in 2011, 
also went on the show and revealed how she broke up with Quinn after he 
hit her in the face.

Quinn admitted attacking both women 'in self-defence', adding: 'Isn’t a person allowed to make mistakes?'

During the show, Quinn also proposed to Ms Peters and was immediately ridiculed by Kyle.

Quinn responded: 'What will it take? I am a wife-beater and I need help.'

But Quinn now claims the producers put him up to the proposal.

He
 said: 'The producers bought me a wee stupid Argos ring and said the 
best thing to do after I’d been confronted was to get down on one knee 
and propose.'

His relationship with Alice ended in March last year. 

A month later, Quinn moved in with Laura Lynskey, 20, and they were engaged by June.

History: Quinn, pictured on the February show with his current girlfriend Jacqueline Scott, previously went on Jeremy Kyle for an episode about domestic violence in 2012

Admissions: Quinn, pictured on Jeremy Kyle in February, previously admitted physically attacking two of his partners in 'self-defence' when he last appeared on the show in 2012

In October, a friend of Ms Lynskey's,
 Jacqueline Scott, also 20, moved in with the couple at their flat in 
Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire.

Quinn then split from Ms Lynskey after she allegedly cheated on him and he started dating Ms Scott in November.

Quinn
 and Ms Scott then got engaged while they were still living with Ms 
Lynskey. All three then appeared on The Jeremy Kyle Show on a programme 
titled: 'Ex, accept I'm with your best friend and get out our house!' in
 February.

Quinn told 
the Record he intended to confront Ms Lynskey on the show for cheating 
on him but the Jeremy Kyle rounded on him instead.

Both woman agree that the show’s editing vilified Quinn.

A
 spokesman for The Jeremy Kyle Show said: 'Mr Quinn has made no 
complaint to us and our records show he both signed a consent form and 
saw our aftercare team following the show. We would never "bearbait" in 
any way.'
