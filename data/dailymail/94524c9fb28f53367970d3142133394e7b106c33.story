Giving support: Hollywood actress Nastassja Kinski said she was 'deeply shocked' after her sister's confession

Film star Nastassja Kinski has said she is ‘deeply shocked’ after her sister wrote that she was repeatedly raped by their father, German actor Klaus Kinski.

Speaking yesterday, Nastassja said she was going through a ‘difficult moment’ after the revelations, but that she was proud of her half-sister for speaking out.

Nastassja, 51, said: ‘My sister is a heroine, because she has freed her heart, her soul and also her future from the weight of the secret.’

Pola Kinski described a catalogue of abuse by Klaus from the age of five until she was 19 in her new autobiography.

She writes that her father would buy 
her expensive gifts after he raped her.

He paid her ‘to be his little 
sex object, placed on silk cushions’ said Pola.

‘I kept quiet for years 
because he forbade me from talking about it.

‘The terrible thing is he  once told 
me it was completely natural, that fathers all over  the world did that 
with  their daughters.’

Pola, the actor’s daughter from his 
first marriage to singer Gislinde Kühlbeck, says the abuse began after 
he divorced her mother in 1955.

He would then summon her to hotel rooms 
to abuse her.

‘He ignored everything, including the 
fact that I often tried to resist and told him, “I don’t want to”. He 
simply didn’t care. He just took what he wanted.’

The 60-year-old, who lives with her 
lawyer husband with whom she has three children, said she spoke out to 
help ‘others who have lived through something similar’, and because so 
many people revered her father, who died in 1991 aged 65.

‘I couldn’t stand hearing it any more:
“Your father! Cool! Genius! I always loved him!”’, she told German 
magazine Stern. ‘He really abused everyone.’

Nastassja has been touched by scandal 
before, having begun a relationship in 1976 aged 15 with director Roman 
Polanski, who was then 43. She went on to star in his 1979 film, Tess.

In 1984 she married Egyptian filmmaker
Ibrahim Moussa, with whom she had two children, and later had a 
daughter with musician Quincy Jones, from whom she broke up in 1995.

for German director Werner Herzog, and also appeared in Doctor Zhivago 
in 1965 and For a Few Dollars More with Clint Eastwood.

After the breakdown of his first marriage, Kinski wed actress Ruth Brigitte Tocki, with whom he had Nastassja.
