When Newcastle United signed Siem de Jong for just £6 million in July, Alan Pardew hailed the capture as a 'coup'.

Once again the club's transfer model – headed by chief scout Graham Carr – was lauded as the envy of Europe.

But De Jong was no secret – he was, after all, a title-winning Ajax captain and Holland international who had scored three times against Manchester City in the Champions League.

Newcastle United midfielder Siem de Jong has been ruled out for at least eight weeks with a collapsed lung

The former Ajax star signed for Newcastle last summer for a £6million fee but has struggled with injuries

Why, then, did Newcastle land the attacking midfielder virtually unopposed and at a seemingly bargain price?

Perhaps now we know. Worryingly, Newcastle should have known in the summer.

It was confirmed on Tuesday that De Jong will miss the next two months because of a collapsed lung, the second time in 18 months he has been hospitalised with such a serious problem.

Now a collapsed lung is scary enough, a recurring collapsed lung is terrifying.

This isn't a calf, hamstring or thigh strain – although he has suffered from each of those – this is a vital organ breaking down, again.

The 26-year-old was only days away from a return to action after five months out with a torn thigh muscle when the Magpies revealed he had undergone surgery on his lung.

Before the thigh problem he had missed much of pre-season with a calf injury. Indeed, De Jong has made just one start and one substitute appearance in the Premier League for United.

It was in August, 2013 that he was first sidelined with a collapsed lung. He returned but his progress was hampered by niggling muscle strains.

In addition to his lung problems, De Jong's career has been blighted by a series of recurring muscle strains

Before his injury-hit 2013-2014 campaign, De Jong had scored over 15 goals in four consecutive seasons 

Interestingly, Newcastle had been watching the player for 14 months before bringing him to Tyneside – Carr, Pardew and Peter Beardsley had all checked in on the elegant playmaker. They were prepared to discount last season and instead focused on his undoubted pedigree – for he'd barely missed a game during the previous four campaigns in which he scored north of 15 goals on each occasion.

But De Jong's own comments about his initial lung episode – and his subsequent struggle for fitness – should read as a warning, and perhaps concern, for United going forward.

'It (the collapsed lung) was quite scary,' he said. 'It happened at the beginning of the season, and after that I had to be in bed for a couple of weeks.

'Looking back afterwards, we didn't focus enough on my entire body and focused too much on the lung.

'The lung was good after three weeks but the rest of the body just wasn't strong enough to play games, and that's what we forgot a little.

'During the season I had some other small injuries which was part of not being strong enough.' 

While playing for Ajax, De Jong scored three times against Manchester City in the Champions League

De Jong won four back-to-back Eredivisie titles between 2010 and 2014 and has six caps for Holland

And that is the worry for Newcastle, not only the fear of a recurrence, but the impact a collapsed lung has on the strength of the body.

There is a precedent in these parts. Former Durham cricketer Mark Davies – brother of Bradford City defender, Andrew – twice suffered a collapsed lung during his career and was plagued by other injuries, eventually forcing his retirement last year.

De Jong is unlikely to feature until the final weeks of this season, meaning his campaign will have been written-off by injury.

Having signed him to a six-year contract, Newcastle can only hope we aren't writing that again.

Newcastle fans will hope that the man hailed as Yohan Cabaye's replacement can return to full fitness soon
