Arizona Senator John McCain, himself tortured for years while held captive in a Vietnamese prison, says that an execution that took nearly two hours at an Arizona prison was a form of 'torture.'

On Wednesday, convicted murderer Joseph Wood - who gunned down his former girlfriend and her father in 1989 - was put to death at the state prison in Florence after losing a last-minute appeal.

Witnesses described seeing Wood struggling to breathe and gasping for air almost the entire time.

Torture: Senator John McCain says the nearly two hours it took to execute Joseph Wood amounts to 'torture'

POW: McCain was held for five years at the 'Hanoi Hilton' prison camp in Vietnam, where he often was tortured

'I believe in the death penalty for certain crimes. But that is not an acceptable way of carrying it out. And people who were responsible should be held responsible,' McCain told Politico. 'The lethal injection needs to be an indeed lethal injection and not the bollocks-upped situation that just prevailed. That’s torture.'

McCain spent five years in the 'Hanoi Hilton' - a nickname for the Vietnamese prison camp where he was held captive - after his plane was shot down. He eventually was released, but was tortured repeatedly while a prison.

As Wood gasped for air, his lawyers filed an emergency appeal in federal court demanding that it be stopped. The appeal said Wood was 'gasping and snorting for more than an hour'

Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne's office says 
Wood was pronounced dead at 3.49pm - an hour and 57 minutes after the
 execution started.

Wood was sentenced to death for 
killing Debra Dietz and her father, Eugene Dietz, in 1989 at the 
family's automotive shop in Tucson.

A relative of Wood's victims said she did not believe the killer had suffered - especially compared to the victims.

Killer: Joseph Wood gasped for nearly two hours as he was being executed for murdering two people

'You don't know what excruciating is,' Jeanne Brown told KTLA after the execution. 'What’s excruciating is seeing your dad laying there in a pool of blood, seeing you sister laying there in a pool of blood. This man deserved it. And I shouldn’t really call him a man.'

Before the murders, Wood
 and Debra Dietz, 29, had a tumultuous relationship in which he periodically 
assaulted her. Dietz tried to end their relationship and got an order of
 protection against Wood.

On
 the day of the shooting, Wood went to the auto shop and waited for 
Dietz's father, who disapproved of his daughter's relationship with 
Wood, to get off the phone. Once the father, 55, hung up, Wood pulled out a 
revolver, shot him in the chest and then smiled.

Wood
 then turned his attention toward Debra Dietz, who was trying to 
telephone for help.

Wood grabbed her by the neck and put his gun to her 
chest. She pleaded with him to spare her life. An employee heard Wood 
say, 'I told you I was going to do it, I have to kill you.' He then 
called her an expletive and fired two shots in her chest.  

Relief: Jeanne Brown, whose sister and father were killed by Wood in 1989, is pictured at a news conference after the execution as her husband Richard Brown listens. She said that Wood had deserved to die

Inhumane: Arizona Republic justice reporter Michael Kiefer describes how Wood gasped and breathed heavily before he died. Media witnesses agreed they had never seen an execution like it

On Wednesday, Wood looked around the 
death chamber and glanced at the doctors as they made preparations for 
his execution, locating the proper veins and inserting two lines into 
his arms.

Wood then uttered his final words, smiled at the victim's family members and made eye contact with a deacon.

Just
 after declaring that he was at peace with his death, he smiled at the 
deacon, but for a second, a subtle look of panic took over his face.

Officials administered the lethal drugs at 1:52 p.m. Wood's eyes closed. About 10 minutes later, the gasping began.

Wood's
 jaw dropped, his chest expanded, and he let out a gasp. The gasps 
repeated every five to 12 seconds. They went on and on, hundreds of 
times. An administrator checked on him a half-dozen times.

Troy Hayden, who witnessed the execution as he covered it for KSAZ , likened Wood’s breathing to a 'fish gulping for air'.

'It was tough for everybody in that room,' he said.

Wood could be heard snoring loudly when an administrator turned on a 
microphone to inform the gallery that Wood was still sedated, despite 
the audible sounds.

As the 
episode dragged on, Wood's lawyers frantically drew up an emergency 
legal appeal, asking federal and state courts to step in and stop the 
execution.

'He has been gasping for more than an hour,' the lawyers pleaded in their filings. 'He is still alive.'  

Praying: Robert Hungerford, of Phoenix, prays as he and a group of about a dozen death penalty opponents protest the execution of Joseph Rudolph Wood at the state prison in Florence, Arizona on Wednesday

The
 Arizona Supreme Court convened an impromptu telephone hearing with a 
defense lawyer and attorney for the state to decide what to do.

Wood
 took his last breath at 3:37 p.m. Twelve minutes later, Arizona 
Department of Corrections Director Charles L. Ryan declared Wood dead.

The state court was informed of the death while its hearing was underway.

It
 took one hour and 57 minutes for Wood's execution to be completed, and 
Wood was gasping for more than an hour and a half of that time.

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer had told 
the Department of Corrections to review the process, saying she was 
concerned by the length of time it took to carry out the injections.

Still, she said, there was nothing unlawful about the death.

She
 said: 'One thing is certain, however, inmate Wood died in a lawful 
manner and by eyewitness and medical accounts he did not suffer.

'This
 is in stark comparison to the gruesome, vicious suffering that he 
inflicted on his two victims — and the lifetime of suffering he has 
caused their family.'

After the death, a federal judge ordered officials to preserve all physical evidence in Wood's execution for an investigation.

Desperate: Arizona's highest court on Wednesday temporarily halted the execution of the condemned inmate so it could consider a last-minute appeal. Wood's death was one of a number of botched executions

The lengthy
 execution quickly re-ignited the death penalty debate as critics 
denounced it as cruel and unusual punishment and said it raised grave 
questions about the two-drug combination Arizona uses for lethal 
injections.

Wood had 
waged an intense, last-minute legal battle that challenged the state 
over key information about who supplies the drugs and how they are 
administered.

The execution came after the U.S. Supreme Court denied several appeals seeking details about the state's execution methods.

There have been several controversial 
executions recently, including that of an Ohio inmate in January who 
snorted and gasped during the 26 minutes it took him to die.

Arizona's
 highest court temporarily halted the execution of the condemned inmate 
Wednesday morning so it could consider a last-minute appeal before soon 
allowing it to proceed.

The
 appeal focused on arguments that Wood, 55, received inadequate legal 
representation at his sentencing, along with a challenge about the 
secrecy of the lethal injection drugs.

The execution occurred amid new scrutiny nationwide over lethal injections after several controversial executions.

The
 U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday cleared the way for Arizona to carry out 
its third execution in the last year following a closely watched First 
Amendment fight over the secrecy issue.

Wood's lawyers used a new legal tactic
 in which defense attorneys claim their clients' First Amendment rights 
are being violated by the government's refusal to reveal details about 
lethal injection drugs.

Wood's
 lawyers were seeking information about the two-drug combination that 
finally killed him, including the makers of the drugs.

A federal appeals court ruled in Wood's favor before the U.S. Supreme Court put the execution back on track.

The
 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision marked the first time an 
appeals court has acted to delay an execution based on the issue of drug
 secrecy, said Richard Dieter, director of the Death Penalty Information
 Center in Washington, D.C.

The
 9th Circuit gave new hope to death penalty opponents. While many death 
row inmates have made the same First Amendment argument as Wood, the 
Supreme Court has not been receptive to the tactic. The court has ruled 
against them each time the transparency issue has come before the 
justices.

States have 
refused to reveal details such as which pharmacies are supplying lethal 
injection drugs and who is administering them because of concerns over 
harassment.

An Ohio inmate in January snorted and gasped during the 26 minutes it took him to die. In Oklahoma, an inmate died of a heart attack minutes after prison officials halted the process of his execution because the drugs weren't being administered properly.

The fight over the Arizona execution has also attracted attention because of a dissenting judge's comments that made a case for a firing squad as a more humane method of execution.

'The guillotine is probably best but seems inconsistent with our national ethos. And the electric chair, hanging and the gas chamber are each subject to occasional mishaps. The firing squad strikes me as the most promising,' wrote Alex Kozinski, the 9th Circuit's chief judge.

'Using drugs meant for individuals with medical needs to carry out executions is a misguided effort to mask the brutality of executions by making them look serene and peaceful - like something any one of us might experience in our final moment.'
