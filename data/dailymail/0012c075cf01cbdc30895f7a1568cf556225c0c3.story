A former 
Cincinnati Bengals cheerleader accused of having sex with a 
16-year-old male student will be allowed to sue a website for defamation, a court has ruled. 

Sarah Jones, 26, has brought a lawsuit against the gossip website TheDirty.com after photographs and postings were uploaded in 2009 that branded her a 'slut with two STDs'.

Posts claimed she had sex with a boyfriend in her classroom at Dixie Heights High School in Edgewood, Kentucky. She 
said the claims cost her reputation with colleagues at the 
school.

Victory? Bengal cheerleader and teacher Sarah Jones has sued TheDirty.com for character defamation after it posted photos in 2009 branding her a 'slut' for allegedly sleeping with a student at her Kentucky school

When she emailed the site to plead they 
take photographs down, more posts appeared claiming she had had sex with
Bengals players.

Appearing on ABC at the time, she said: 
'To stand in front of 30 15-year-olds and tell them you don't have two 
STDs and that you are not a slut is the hardest thing you will ever have
to do.'

Jones sued Nik Richie, TheDirty.com’s
founder, for character defamation. She was awarded an $11million 
default judgement but the litigation is ongoing.

Judge William Bertelsman at the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decided yesterday that the website could not appeal the decision that it was liable to Jones.

TheDirty.com had hoped it would be shielded by the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA) because it had merely posted information written by others.

However the website's lawyer David Gingras told Cincinnati.com that the court's decision 'is not the result I wanted to see, but it is actually a disaster for Jones'.

Mr Gringas said he planned to grill Jones about the sexual allegations against her. Jones was accused 
of sleeping with a 16-year-old football player  while teaching in a Kentucky school last 
year.

She resigned from her job teaching high school English in November citing 'personal reasons'. Her estranged husband has chosen to file for an annulment.

Jones, a five-year veteran of the 
Ben-Gals cheerleading squad, was indicted in Covington, Kentucky on 
charges of first-degree sexual abuse last month.

The indictment states the alleged sexual relationship with the high school student took place between October 1 and December 31.

She pleaded not guilty to unlawful use of electronic means to 
induce a minor to engage in sexual activities, a 
charge often reserved for people peddling child pornography over 
the Internet.

Her mother Cheryl, 55, a middle 
school principal who is now on administrative leave, faces a single 
charge of tampering with evidence in her daughter's case. She also 
pleaded not guilty in April.

Computers belonging to Cheryl and 
Sarah Jones, as well as those of the alleged victim's family, were 
seized as part of the investigation. It is believed text messages will 
also be central to the case.

Sarah
Jones's bond was previously set at $50,000 while her mother's was set 
at $30,000. Judge Patricia Summe reduced both to $15,000.

She is scheduled to stand trial on June 27.

In the civil defamation case being 
brought by Jones, the judge said that TheDirty.com would have the 
right to probe the allegations being made against her in the criminal trial.
