As one of the most poorest countries in the world, Haiti isn't most holidaymakers' first-choice destination.

However, nearly five years on from the earthquake that devastated the Caribbean republic, plans have been unveiled showing what developers have in mind to attract more travellers.

It comes after Haiti's tourism minister Stephanie Villedrouin on Thursday said the country - which shares an island with the Dominican Republic - is open for tourism.

Holiday destination: President wants to build Haiti's biggest tourism development in Cotes-de-Fer

An artist's impression released by Haiti’s Ministry of Tourism and Creatives’ Industries offers a sneak peek into the future, showing what developers have in mind for the coastal town of Cotes-de-Fer.

President Michel Martelly's administration wants to build Haiti's biggest tourism development, hoping that foreign visitors can help spur an economic revival in the nation.

Officials hope it will become Haiti's version of Punta Cana, a major resort town carved out of a fishing village in the neighboring Dominican Republic in the 1970s.

The renderings reveal a sprawling, five-star resort, boasting high-end accommodation, luxury villas and a stunning palm tree-lined swimming pool.

The poor Caribbean village hosted government leaders for an event as officials seek to line up investors to help encourage economic revival.

As the country enjoys a period of relative tranquility after years of turmoil, Haitian officials say they see tourism as key to economic development.

The area is a hot spot for natural disasters and has suffered years of abuse by cyclones, heavy rains, tropical storms, earthquakes and flooding.

Sunshine: Hurricane season in Haiti lasts from June to the end of November

Just this week thousands of families in Haiti and the neighbouring Dominican Republic were displaced by floods from a storm system that drenched the countries for several days.

Haiti's Department of Civil Protection said at least 6,000 homes were flooded in Cap-Haitien and several nearby communities and at least 66 homes were completely destroyed.

But there is hope to re-establish the area as a comfortable and safe holiday destination. Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti, has rebounded well from the devastation of the 2010 earthquake and it’s hoping momentum will continue in areas such as Cotes-de-Fer.
