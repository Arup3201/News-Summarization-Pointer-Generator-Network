An Australian cruise is set to sail for Vanuatu in a bid to deliver desperately needed supplies in the wake of Tropical Cyclone Pam.

P&O Cruises' Brisbane-based superliner Pacific Dawn will be loaded with supplies including tarpaulins and tents for emergency shelter, bottled water and canned food.

As the first cruise ship to visit Port Vila, the seven-night cruise to New Caledonia and Vanuatu will now double as a humanitarian aid mission.

P&O Cruises' spokesman David Jones told News Corp passengers reacted positively after being notified that their week-long trip will make a special stop in Vanuatu.

'They feel quite honoured to be part of the humanitarian mission and we feel quite inspired by our own passengers,' Mr Jones said.

'It will be one of those cruises that all the crew and passengers will remember being a part of.'Â 

Passengers aboard will not be allowed to leave the ship while it plans to dock until all supplies are offloaded when they arrive on Wednesday.

Pallets of cargo, including vital supplies will be loaded onto the ship on Saturday morning and handed over during a brief call to Port Vila mid-next week.

The aid follows after P&O's parent company Carnival Australia announced its four ships were taking part in the rescue mission to deliver resources and humanitarian aid.

Carnival Legend arrived in Vanuatu on Thursday to deliver goods to Santo, Carnival Spirit departed Sydney on Thursday while Pacific Pearl will leave on Monday.

'I'm hoping to visit Vanuatu over the weekend if there's a military transport plane going that I can get aboard because I want to see for myself that all that can be done is being done,' she said.

'I believe it will be a long-term effort.

'It was a pretty devastating cyclone and we'll continue to stand with our friend, our neighbour in the Pacific so they recover from this devastation.'
