As far as neighbourhood disputes go, this is one you really don't want to get caught in the middle of.

On a quiet suburban street in Alaska two giant moose bulls butt heads and wrestle with their antlers is a show of raw power. 

A shaky YouTube video captures the action from a safe distance in the residential area of an unidentified town.

Two large moose bulls fight on a suburban street in Alaska, and it's all caught on camera

The moose start fighting on the street and push each other with their giant antlers 

The moose are filmed facing off on the road, watched by a postman keeping a safe distance inside his mail truck.

As the duo duel with their horns locked, the fight ends up on somebody's front lawn and out of sight around the back of the house as neither is willing to give an inch. 

The eager cameraman hurries after the pair to continue filming the fight, but doesn't manage to get there in time to see how it all turns out.

The battle spills into someone's yard, perilously close to a truck and camper parked in the driveway

But the time the filmmaker catches up, one moose is calmly walking away while the other stands his ground by the house.  

The incident occurred during the rut, or mating season, for the moose. While bulls don't make a habit of wandering around town, this is the time of year that reason goes out the window and bulls often fight over female mates.

The moose rut is at its peak in late September and early October, and is the prime hunting season.

The video, uploaded to YouTube two years ago, has had over 200,000 hits.
