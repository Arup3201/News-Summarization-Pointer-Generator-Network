Plumes of water vapour 100 miles high may have been spotted bursting out of the icy surface of Jupiter's moon Europa.

Scientists believe they detected two vapour jets shooting into space for seven hours at a time.

Like 'Old Faithful', the famous volcanic geyser in Yellowstone National Park, U.S., the plumes appear to erupt at regular intervals.

This is an artist's concept of a plume of water vapour thought to be ejected off the frigid, icy surface of the Jovian moon Europa, located about 500 million miles (800 million kM0 from the sun

But while Old Faithful manages around 100 feet, Europa's vapour fountains are thought to reach heights of 124 miles - around 20 times higher than the peak of Mount Everest.

If confirmed, the observations prove that water from the moon's ice-covered ocean can easily reach the surface, which has important implications for future space missions.

Many experts believe the hidden ocean surrounding Europa, warmed by powerful tidal forces caused by Jupiter's gravity, may have conditions favourable to life.

Jupiter's icy moon Europa is slightly smaller than the Earth's Moon.

Europa orbits Jupiter every 3.5 days and is phase locked -- just like 
Earth's Moon -- so that the same side of Europa faces Jupiter at all 
times.

However, because Europa orbits in an oval, when it is close to Jupiter the tide is much higher.

It is thought to have an iron core, a rocky mantle and a surface ocean of salty water, like Earth.

Unlike on Earth, however, this ocean is deep enough to cover the whole surface of Europa, and being far from the sun, the ocean surface is globally frozen over.

Many experts believe the hidden ocean 
surrounding Europa, warmed by powerful tidal forces caused by Jupiter's 
gravity, may have conditions favourable to life.

Scientists used images from the Hubble Space Telescope to identify unusual 'spikes' of hydrogen and oxygen in two distinct regions of the moon's southern hemisphere.

They were observed for just seven hours at a time when Europa was at the furthest point of its orbit away from Jupiter, vanishing as the moon got closer.

The discovery suggests the presence of high jets of water vapour - water is made from hydrogen and oxygen - that may be triggered by tidal forces opening cracks in Europa's surface.

The team led by Dr Lorenz Roth, from Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, Texas, wrote in the journal Science: 'These emissions are persistently found in the same area over around seven hours.. They are consistent with two 200 kilometre-high plumes of water vapour.'

Similar plumes have previously been seen on one of Saturn's moons, Enceladus.

Details of the discovery were also presented at the American Geophysical Union's autumn meeting in San Francisco.

As well as Hubble, Nasaâ€™s Cassini spacecraft is also currently providing scientists with key clues about Saturn's moons.

In particular it is looking at the moon Titan and its hydrocarbon seas. Titan is one of the most Earth-like places in the solar system, and the only place other than our planet that has stable liquid on its surface.

Cassini's recent close flybys are bringing into sharper focus a region in Titan's northern hemisphere that sparkles with almost all of the moon's seas and lakes.

Scientists working with the spacecraft's radar instrument have put together the most detailed multi-image mosaic of that region to date. The image includes all the seas and most of the major lakes.

The images show that the seasare more extensive and complex than previously thought. They also show nearly all of the lakes on Titan fall into an area covering about 600 miles by 1,100 miles (900 km by 1,800 km). Only 3 per cent of the liquid at Titan falls outside of this area.

'Scientists have been wondering why Titan's lakes are where they are. These images show us that the bedrock and geology must be creating a particularly inviting environment for lakes in this box,' said Randolph Kirk, a Cassini radar team member at the U.S. Geological Survey in Flagstaff, Ariz.

'We think it may be something like the formation of the prehistoric lake called Lake Lahontan near Lake Tahoe in Nevada and California, where deformation of the crust created fissures that could be filled up with liquid.'
