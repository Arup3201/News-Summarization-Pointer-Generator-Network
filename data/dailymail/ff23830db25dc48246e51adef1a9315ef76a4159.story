The grandmother of murdered schoolboy Daniel Pelka today spoke out to defend her daughter saying social services should be blamed for his death.

Jolanta Luczak said the four-year-old's mother Magdelena Luczak, 27, was a 'really normal girl' despite the fact that she is facing a lengthy prison term along with her partner Mariusz Krezolek.

Speaking from her home in Lodz, Poland, Mrs Luczak told Sky News: 'I don't know who influenced her.

'I
don’t know what kind of man she met, what she did, what she was 
thinking but please tell the judge that she was a really normal girl.

'Social services should also be held responsible because they also failed
the test.'

Luczak, 27, and Krezolek, 34, are facing
life sentences for murdering the four-year-old Coventry schoolboy who 
was systematically starved under the noses of his teachers and health 
professionals.

Geoffrey Robinson, MP for Coventry North West, said Daniel was 'badly let down' not just by 'an evil stepfather and an indifferent and selfish mother' but also by his school, health professionals and social services.

He called for children’s services director Colin Green to resign now, rather than in September as planned, saying: 'He takes with him the indelible stain of Daniel’s cruel death, which his department had failed to prevent.'

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said that Daniel's 'vile, evil murder' should be 'on all of our consciences'.

Jurors took less than four hours to unanimously convict Luczak and Krezolek following a nine-week trial at Birmingham Crown Court.

They battered Daniel to death after a six-month campaign of cruelty in which he was denied food, 'imprisoned' in a locked box room and force-fed salt.

The pair, both originally from Poland, also forced Daniel to perform arduous punishment exercises such as squats or running, while hoodwinking teachers and doctors into believing his weight loss was due to an eating disorder.

Mr Robinson said: 'How can the staff 
at the school attended by Daniel have failed to have recognised patterns
of behaviour that should have set alarm bells ringing, not only within 
the school but within the corridors of power within the Council House?

'How
could anyone believe it to be normal for a child to climb on the top of
furniture to get to food; to scavenge around bins to access waste; and 
to steal food from the lunch-boxes?

'What human being, with the slightest
understanding of children, would not have been concerned enough to take
action to set alarm bells ringing?

'Where were these individuals when Daniel needed them most? Bureaucracy triumphed over common sense, care, and compassion.

'Those who failed Daniel must examine
their own consciences, and conclude whether it is appropriate for them 
to remain in their posts.'

Speaking on LBC 97.3 radio, Mr Clegg 
said: 'Clearly people must have seen something was wrong with this boy. I
think his death should be on all of our consciences.'

Luczak told the court that her partner Mariusz Krezolek (pictured with her) had hit Daniel around the head and then tried to strangle her

Asked what the Government could do in
response, Mr Clegg said: 'What we have done already is get rid of a lot
of the complexity and bureaucracy that we worry might have meant that 
cases were not picked up earlier.

'We’ve simplified the way in which child protection is organised.'

Mr Clegg said an independent person 
would be named as soon as possible to hold a serious case review into 
Daniel’s death, which would play 'a disproportionately important role in
showing what more we need to do to make sure that people don’t fall 
between the cracks'.

Last night, it emerged that Krezolek is a wanted criminal in his homeland, while Luczak was a drug addicted prostitute.

They have both been found guilty of 
the horrific murder of Luczak's son Daniel, who resembled a 
‘concentration camp victim’ when he died following an ‘incomprehensible’
campaign of cruelty carried out by the evil pair.

Krezolek
moved to Britain in 2006 despite the fact that Polish police were 
hunting him after he violated the terms of his suspended sentence.

‘He is a wanted man,’ a police source said. ‘He breached the terms of his sentence.’

Krezolek’s sister also revealed that he was a violent criminal who was booted out of the army for attacking a fellow recruit.

Speaking
from their family home in a village near Wroclaw in South West Poland 
where she still lives, she also told the Mail that her brother 
terrorised her when she was growing up.

Asking not to be named, she said: ‘My brother is on a wanted list in Poland. He has brought public shame on the family.

‘He
was in the army and got into a fight and the person he beat up ended up
in hospital and he ended up in a martial court. He was punished for it.

‘When I was 18 and he was 15 he used to beat me up. It is horrible for me to talk about this.

‘Nobody wants to hear their brother 
was involved in the death of a child, but I’m not going to defend him. 
Never in my life would I ever leave my children with him.’

She added that he was a heavy drinker 
who regularly used amphetamines and the police and local prosecutors 
were regular visitors to the family home.

Krezolek’s other sister, who lives nearby and also asked not to be named, said: ‘I have no brother.’

Krezolek met Luczak in England after 
she left her life in a concrete housing estate in the run-down city of 
Lodz in central Poland.

Her mother Yolanta was described by neighbours as anxious and highly-strung. They added that she used to beat her daughter.

Her father Witold – who was rarely at home – worked as a driver while her mother raised the children in the tiny flat.

Neighbours told how the family of 
seven had not paid rent for 24 years for their pokey three-bed council 
apartment in a towering high-rise block.

'My mother came back with terrible stories'

Magdelena Luczak’s younger sister

Luczak’s younger sister said her mother had been worried for her grandson’s safety when she visited two weeks before his death.

The mother-of-two, who lives in Lodz 
and asked not to be identified, said: ‘My mother went to England to 
visit Magda two weeks before Daniel died and came back with terrible 
stories.

‘She said “Something terrible is 
happening in that house. Magda is being terrorised by Mariusz. Something
very bad is happening in that house”.

‘It’s my sister’s fault that she did not react when her son was in danger. She has responsibility for what happened.’

Luczak’s mother Yolanta told the Mail 
her husband had died as a result of the stress of seeing his daughter 
charged with the murder of his grandson.

She said: ‘Mariusz doesn’t deserve to walk on this earth. I’m in no state to talk about this, my life is full of tragedy.’

As a girl, blonde-haired Luczak dreamed of being the next Emma Bunton and belted out Spice Girls songs at the top of her voice.

‘But just a few years later, she was 
caking her face in make-up, wearing expensive clothes and being picked 
up by strange men late at night.

One neighbour, who asked not to be 
named, said: ‘The same car would drop her off in the morning and pick 
her up at night and we thought the driver was probably her pimp.’

Another neighbour added: ‘Magda had a very difficult childhood because her mother was aggressive.’

Last night, Daniel’s natural father, 
lorry driver Eryk Pelka, said: ‘I feel hate towards Magda. I hope she 
will never come out of jail. I had very limited access to Daniel once I 
returned to Poland. Every time I rang Magda would make excuses.’

Polish police said Krezolek has two 
drink driving convictions for which he received a suspended sentence and
a driving ban and four convictions for driving while disqualified.
