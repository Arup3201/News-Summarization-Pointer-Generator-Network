Owais Shah has been cleared of any wrongdoing in connection with the IPL spot-fixing scandal, according to reports in India.

The former England batsman had issued a statement on Friday expressing his ‘distress’ after his name — along with Indian all-rounder Stuart Binny and West Indies leg-spinner Samuel Badree — was inadvertently read out by an Indian judge at the Supreme Court in Delhi.

But it has emerged that all three cricketers have in fact been cleared by the Mudgal Report into corruption at the 2013 IPL, the world’s richest Twenty20 tournament.

Shah, 36, who last played for England in 2009 — having appeared in six Tests, 71 one-day internationals and 17 Twenty20 matches — turned out for IPL franchise Rajasthan Royals in 2012 and 2013. 

According to ESPNcricinfo, Shah was investigated following an incident involving the Royals, but was exonerated by the report.
