Two-year-old twin sisters are not able to enjoy playing in the park or to go on holiday because the excitement could kill them.

Darcie and Evie Chapman, from Warrington, Cheshire, are the only twins in the UK to have a severe form of epilepsy called Dravet Syndrome.

Seizures can lead to SUDEP (sudden 
unexplained death in epilepsy patients) and the condition leads to 
delays in development, feeding problems, sleep problems and 
behavioural problems.

Evie and Darcie Chapman have a severe form of epilepsy called Dravet Syndrome. It causes seizures, developmental delays, behavioural problems and feeding difficulties. They are pictured with parents, Mark and Natalie

Triggers for the seizures include excitement and extremes of temperature, meaning the girls must be strictly monitored.

Mother Natalie, 36, said: 'The worst case scenario is that they 
can have a fit and die in their beds, or that the oxygen supply to the 
brain stops and leaves them brain damaged.

'At their worst we were calling out 
ambulance after ambulance, but now they just have one or two fits a 
month each. It's a big improvement.

'We try and keep things as normal as possible for them but it's hard, especially because there's two of them with Dravet.

'They see each other not walking and talking and think that it's normal.

'We have to be on high alert at all times and avoid their triggers, we have to constantly watch them - it's exhausting.'

Evie and Darcie's seizures are triggered by excitement and extremes of temperature meaning that their parents constantly have to ensure that they are not getting over excited and that they are not too hot

The twins experienced their first seizures when they went on holiday to Spain at nine-months-old. They were diagnosed at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool when they got home

Darcie and Evie experienced their first seizure on a holiday to Spain when they were nine-months-old.

Ms Chapman, a project manager for a building company, explained: 'Darcie had a fit first. It lasted about 20 minutes which is a long time.I just had no idea what was happening. We didn't even know the ambulance number.'

The hospitals in Spain are not like 
they are over here. They told us to get a taxi or drive there ourselves 
as an ambulance could take over an hour to get to us. We had to carry her
in on foot.

Dravet Syndrome is a rare and catastrophic form of epilepsy that begins in infancy.

Children with Dravets tend to have normal development as babies but development starts to plateau when they are in their second year of life.

Individuals with Dravet syndrome face a higher incidence of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy patients (SUDEP).

They ofen also experience other conditions including developmental delays, sleeping difficulties, chronic infections and difficulty feeding.

There is currently no cure and treatment options are limited - they mainly involve using anti-epilepsy drugs to treat the seizures.

Little is known about the long term prognosis of people with Dravet Syndrome.

'We were in there for what felt like forever because no one could speak any English.

'The next day Evie had a staring 
episode. Her eyes were rolling and we couldn't distract her by doing 
anything. We didn't realise it at the time but that's another kind of 
seizure.

'It was our first family holiday since 
the girls had been born, and holidays abroad are a no-no now unless we 
know there will be really good air conditioning.'

When the family returned to England they visited their GP who assured them that some children have fits, but that 
it could be a febrile convulsion that a lot of children have once in 
their life.

But the twins' fits became more and more frequent.

Eventually they were referred to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool for tests on their brain activity.

Ms Chapman said: 'Evie had a fit where she 
looked to one side while we were at the hospital. As soon as the doctor 
saw that he suspected it was Dravet Syndrome.

'They told us not to go home and look it up, but of course I did.

'I was absolutely devastated. To think 
that you have normal children only to be told at nine-months-old that 
they have a life limiting form of genetic illness that may cause them to
need care for the rest of their lives - it was horrendous.

'Tests confirmed our worst fears as we 
tried to carry on as normally as we could whilst carrying the huge 
burden that our girls were seriously ill.'

Little is known about the long term prognosis of people with Dravet Syndrome but they tend to have normal development until they are two-years-old at which point their development plateaus

Now, the seizures are controlled by medication and the twins have far fewer fits.

In the future, the children may be eligible for treatment using a special diet, known as a ketogenic diet.

The ketogenic diet is an eating plan which forces the body to burn stored fat instead of glucose.

This is achieved by making fat products the primary food that is consumed and by limiting the amount of carbohydrates eaten.

It is not known exactly why this can prevent seizures but it is known that it works in some patients but not in others.

They are at constant risk of SUDEP - sudden unexplained death in epilepsy patients - which is particularly common in people with this form of epilepsy

The twins' seizures are now successfully controlled with medication meaning that they each only have two or three fits each month

About a third of children who are on the diet become seizure-free, while another third improve but still have some seizures.

The rest either do not respond or find it too difficult to stick to the diet.

It is thought that following this diet also causes children to be more alert.

Some people can be weaned off the diet after about two years.

However, there can be side effects to the diet such as dehydration, constipation, kidney stones and gall stones.

When they are older, the twins might be eligible for treatment using a special diet called a ketogenic diet - this is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet which forces the body to run off stored fat rather than glucose

It is not known why the diet reduces seizures, but in a third of children it stops them altogether and a further third see significant improvements in their symptoms

Ms Chapman said: 'The ketogenic diet has rave reviews and eliminates the need for medicine in some cases.

'Some users find that once their 
children are off the medicine and on the diet they get their child back,
as in they could speak and walk.

'It's a very strict diet and the twins are not eating the best anyway. It would be too hard for them to stick to at this age.'

Ms Chapman, and the twins' father Mark, 37, a civil servant, are hoping that one day
a cure will be found for Dravet Syndrome.

Marie Baker, from the charity Dravet 
Syndrome UK, said: 'Dravet Syndrome is one of the most catastrophic 
epilepsies with higher rates of SUDEP than other forms of epilepsy.

'Seizures are very difficult to control 
on conventional anti-epileptic medications and patients are prone to 
status epilepticus, seizures that last longer than 15 minutes. The 
longer a seizure lasts the higher the risks of the patient developing 
brain damage.

'Alongside the seizures, which present 
in the first year of life, patients with Dravet Syndrome also suffer 
varying degrees of learning disability and many are diagnosed as being 
on the autistic spectrum. Patients can also have mobility, communication
and eating difficulties.

'It is extremely unusual for twins to be
diagnosed with the condition and out of a membership of over 200 
families Darcie and Evie are our only twins.'
