Oliver Cheshire is back as the face of Marks & Spencer Best of British in the label's latest collection of snappy suits

The London-born model, 25, looks quite the dapper English gentleman - with a 70s edge - as he shows off the High Street store's heritage tailoring.

This time he's modelling single-breasted jackets with wide lapels and big checks, chunky roll-neck knits and velvet evening suits.

'It's such
 a privilege to be the face of the Marks & Spencer Best of British 
range again,' says Oliver, who has been the face of the brand from the beginning.

'The
 new collection is full of classic pieces that have a contemporary feel,
 including velvet suits, leather accessories as well as more amazing 
check suits, which were a favourite of mine in the previous collections 
and have become iconic pieces within the range.'

The 47-piece Best of British Menswear collection comprises a capsule edit of formal premium pieces manufactured in Britain.

With a focus on British craftsmanship, the collection is developed alongside womenswear by the M&S in-house design team based at the M&S Studio in Shoreditch.

Tony O'Connor, Head of Design, Menswear says: 'This season our menswear Best of British collection focuses on the 1970s and the confidence, swagger and glamour that comes from this era, taking inspiration from our archive in a new and relevant way.

'We researched at our archive in Leeds looking at garments, fabrics and images to develop the collection, and to interpret styles in a new and relevant way. The range is a confident masculine and stylish wardrobe based on a sophisticated tonal palette of camels, browns and taupe, all with the signature luxury of the 1970s.

Tailoring is still the core of the Best of British range crafted in the finest British traditional fabrics. .

'Outerwear sees the addition of coats with velvet top collar details and double breasted styles with shearling, adding retro luxury glamour to classic pieces'.

The first Best of British collection, last year, marked the start of a three-year partnership between M&S and
 the British Fashion Council, under the Positive Fashion initiative, 
which has seen Marks & Spencer debut presentations at both London 
Fashion Week and London Collections: Men.

The AW14 collection will be available to buy in selected stores and online at 
marksandspencer.com from October.
