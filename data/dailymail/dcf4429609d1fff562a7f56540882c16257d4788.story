A storm has blown up over the name of the huge nor'easter that dumped up to 40 inches of snow on the north-eastern U.S. in the last few days.

The Weather Channel (TWC) began naming winter storms in October. This one was christened Nemo, bringing up images of the cute orange fish in the Disney/Pixar film Finding Nemo.

While the name Nemo was widely used on social media, including by New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, other meteorologists are refusing to use it.

They claim that only hurricanes and tropical storms should be named and that this is a PR stunt by The Weather Channel.

Finding Nemo? This 'snowfish' appeared during the nor'easter that dropped up to 40 inches of snow on the north-eastern U.S. But many meteorologists don't think the name Nemo should be used at all

The National Weather Service (NWS), the official government agency, is responsible for naming tropical storms, which then keep their names if they develop into hurricanes.

And the NWS is refusing to acknowledge The Weather Channel's monikers for winter storms. On Thursday a 
spokesman said: 'We never have, nor do we have any plans to 
consider naming winter storms.'

A spokeswoman told The Verge: 'The Weather Channel started naming winter storms, that's their 
project,' she said.

The NWS also put out a statement explaining their policy: 'The National Weather Service does not name
winter storms because a winter storm's impact can vary from one 
location to another, and storms can weaken and redevelop, making it 
difficult to define where one ends and another begins.'

Yet the name Nemo was widely used in many places, including by New York's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, and on Twitter.

Albert Brooks, the actor who voiced Nemo’s dad, Marlin, in the hit film, tweeted: 'They have named this new nor’easter Nemo.
I am not looking for it.'

Whatever you call it, the winter storm blanketed the north-eastern states in snow. Here, the thaw begins on cars parked at a dealership in Hartford, Connecticut on Sunday February 10

TWC started naming winter storms in October, claiming that attaching a name would raise awareness about the dangers of extreme weather.

'The fact is that Twitter needs a hashtag,' Bryan Norcross, a TWC meteorologist responsible for winter weather, told the New York Times recently.

But others were annoyed by The Weather Channel taking it upon itself to name storms.

As reported by the LA Times, Joel 
Meyer, founder of AccuWeather, issued a statement in fall criticizing the Weather Channel 
for its actions.

'In unilaterally deciding to name winter 
storms, the Weather Channel has confused media spin with science and 
public safety,' Meyer said.

'We have explored this issue for 20 years and 
have found that this is not good science and will mislead the public. 
Winter storms are very different from hurricanes.'

Nearly two feet of snow blanketed Massachusetts, including a bank of pay phones on Boston Common in front of the Statehouse

George Wright, a meteorologist at Wright Weather Consulting, said: 'A named storm should be a hurricane, and
only a hurricane.

'A hurricane is something 
that's more unusual and devastating. If you start naming other storms, 
people will suddenly think this might be a hurricane.'

The LA Times reported Thomas Downs, a meteorologist with Weather 2000, saying: 'This is more of a PR stunt by the Weather Channel. It's not something the government is running with.

'There's not really a hold-fast criteria to determine when to name it like there is with hurricanes and tropical storms.'

Downs suggested that stations owned by NBC Universal, which also owns The Weather Channel, would be most likely to use Nemo to describe the storm.

Indeed, NBC Universal channel MSNBC did use the name, while rivals Fox News and CNN both called it a 
'monster storm' or a 'winter storm':

If you were able to enjoy it, like this family in Boston, the snow created a winter wonderland

Local CBS affiliate WFSB in Connecticut called the
storm Blizzard Charlotte, keeping with a long-standing station 
tradition of naming major winter storms affecting the state that dates 
back to the early 1970s.

In relations to the name Nemo itself, Mr Norcross told the New York Times that 'Nemo is a Latin word.'

Norcross helped designate storm names at The Weather Channel last year and said that the translation ('no one' or 'no man') was inspiration for the choice rather the film.

Norcross also claims that Captain
Nemo, the memorable character from Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand 
Leagues Under the Sea' also came up in discussions. 'Captain Nemo was a 
pretty tough, fierce guy,' Mr 
Norcross said.

But other meteorologists suspect a marketing ploy and the federal weather agency won't use Nemo to describe the huge nor'easter
