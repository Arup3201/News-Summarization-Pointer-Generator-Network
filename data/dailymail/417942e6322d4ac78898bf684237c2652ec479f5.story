As if fraught parents didn't have enough to worry about, it has emerged that this Christmas is set to be the biggest year for toy sales in four years.

'Must-have' toys like loom bands, Panini stickers and Lego figures are set to send tills ringing as pleading children and competitive parents drive many to the toy aisles. 

Sales of toys in Britain are up 6 per cent on last year, according to analysts NPD Group - the best result for the industry since 2010.

The figures come as the Toy Retailers Association released its annual DreamToys list, which includes merchandise from the Disney blockbuster Frozen, the £39.99 Vtech Kidizoom Smart Watch, the £58.99 My Friend Cayla doll and collectable Minecraft figures, which cost from £7.99.

Also making the top 12 are Bop It! Beats which combines the original game with songs from popular artists, the £19.99 Little Live Pets Bird Cage, the £44.99 Nerf Demolisher 2-in-1 and the £80 Lego Movie spaceship.

DreamToys committee chairman Gary Grant said: 'It's great to see creative and sharing toys sitting alongside more traditional toys or toys that facilitate a bit of rough and tumble. And with nearly half the list priced under £25, it is relevant for all consumers this Christmas.

'All of the toys on this list will undoubtedly be popular this Christmas, so our advice is to shop early to avoid disappointment.'

The NPD Group predicted that an increase in spending on toys this Christmas would take annual sales to more than £3 billion, an increase of £166 million in one year.

It said the growth was due to continued interest in interactive and internet-connected toys, strong sales in classic categories such as building sets and arts and crafts as well as new, highly anticipated products coming to the market in time for Christmas.

Once, it was up to a child’s imagination to bring a doll to life, WRITES SEAN POULTER.

But now, there is a toy that can actually hold a conversation – and it’s much more than just ‘hello’ and ‘how are you?’

My Friend Cayla, the world’s first ‘living’ doll, can talk about hobbies, tell stories, play games and even help with homework by accessing the internet to search for her answers.

And it seems we will be hearing a lot more of this noisy doll, since it features in a top 12 list of toys predicted to be the best-sellers this Christmas by industry experts.

At 18 inches tall and with a hairbrush and mirror provided for playing with her long blonde hair, Cayla is in many ways like a traditional doll.

But she is the first to be connected to the internet. She works by using voice recognition technology to ‘hear’ what people say. She then sends the sound clip wirelessly to a smartphone app, which translates it into text and searches the internet for an answer.

Some parents don’t seem convinced, with one writing on forum Mumsnet: ‘Personally I find it a bit freaky... I’m sure it’s going to drive me bonkers!’

But manufacturer Vivid insisted the toy, which costs £58.99, is educational. A spokesman said: ‘They can talk about their likes and dislikes and hobbies. Cayla can even answer questions about maths, general knowledge and the weather.’

Vivid added that Cayla’s web searches are controlled by Google’s SafeSearch technology to protect children from unsuitable material and block some words.

Brand manager Catherine Scott said: ‘If swear words or nasty words come up, she will say: “That’s not very nice, we are not talking about that”.’ The top 12 Christmas list, compiled by a panel from the Toy Retailers Association, also includes two dolls inspired by the hit Disney movie Frozen, a clear sign of the mania still surrounding the film almost a year after it was released.

Toy shop owner Gary Grant said there is still huge demand for Frozen merchandise, adding: ‘Quite frankly, you could sell empty boxes if they had Frozen written on them.’

The list is dominated by futuristic toys this year, including a smart watch for children as young as five. The £39.99 Kidizoom watch includes a camera, a voice recorder and games. The most expensive toy on the list is an interactive pet dinosaur called Boomer, at £99.99.

But while children’s toys are becoming ever more high-tech, traditional brand Lego still holds on to a spot in the top 12 with a model of Benny’s Spaceship from this year’s Lego movie.

Increased interest in low-priced and collectable toys such as Panini stickers and Lego mini figures had also spurred healthy growth in impulse-buying, and also meant the average price for toys dropped from £7.69 to £6.95.

Meanwhile, three toys related to Frozen are among the year's top 10 sellers, with sales currently stronger than they were after the film's initial release, NPD said.

From the 72 toys in the list the panel selected 12 Top Toys that they believe will be dominating the

wish lists this Christmas; they are, in alphabetical order:

NPD Group toys analyst Frederique Tutt said: 'The British toy market is leading resurgence in toy sales in Europe.

'The innovation that the industry has invested in has also started to pay back. Impulse sales of collectibles and lower-priced toys are up as well as licences from movies including Frozen, and this year's craze, loom bands.

'These two factors combined delivered the fastest growth rate in toy sales since 2010 which suggests that Christmas 2014 might be the best for some time.'

Best of friends: Sam and his penguin friend Monty in this year's John Lewis Christmas advert 

Last year it was the enduring friendship of a hare and a bear that melted our hearts.

Twelve months on, John Lewis hopes the bond between a boy and a penguin will similarly capture the public’s imagination.

This year’s two-minute festive commercial tells the story of seven-year-old Sam and his friend Monty.

The boy gradually realises Monty is longing for a penguin companion. And so on Christmas morning Sam surprises Monty with the gift of a new penguin friend named Mabel.

The soundtrack is John Lennon’s song Real Love, performed by Tom Odell.

The company has spent £1million creating the ad, while £7million will be spent on the marketing campaign. 

It launches on social media channels today and will screen on television tomorrow during Gogglebox on Channel 4.
