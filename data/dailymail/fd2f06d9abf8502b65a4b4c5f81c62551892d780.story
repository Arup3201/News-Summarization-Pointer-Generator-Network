Ruslan Kogan, founder and CEO of international electronics manufacturer Kogan, washed an employees car after losing a bet

He's been named one of the top 50 most influential people in tech and has a reported wealth of about $315 million.

But come Tuesday, Ruslan Kogan got out the suds and a vacuum cleaner to personally hand clean one of his employee's cars after losing a bet.

Mr Kogan, the founder and CEO of international electronics manufacturer and online retail business Kogan, promised to wash the car of anyone who beat him in the 10 kilometre Melbourne Marathon charity run almost a year ago.

The Melbourne raised millionaire, who sponsored 25 people to participate in the race, was eventually beaten by one of his own employees.

Fulfilling his promise, the serial entrepreneur not only spent half an hour of his day scrubbing away at the jeep, but he even let the winner stream it live for the world to see.

'There was a 10 kilometre charity run almost a year ago and I was trying to motivate as many of my team as possible to enter because we are a tech based business and spend all our time in front of a computer screen,' Mr Kogan told Daily Mail Australia.

'The run was at 7am on Sunday morning, so we sent an email around for the whole team and four or five said "I'm in", but I thought "Nah, we need more people".

The millionaire, who is believed to be worth $315 million, promised to wash the car of any employee who beat him in a 10 kilometre charity run in an effort to encourage his employees to be active

'So I sent another email around saying that whoever enters, if they beat me at this run, I'll wash their car.

'It basically meant I trained pretty hard core - I have a business to run so I didn't want to spend the rest of my life washing cars.'

The award-winning businessman recalled the moment that his employee, a man named Ross Metherell who he said was fairly modest, overtook him on the track.

'I remember I had kilometer to go and I was just ahead of him and then I saw him overtake me and sprint towards the finish line – he beat me by like a 100 metres,' Mr Kogan said.

It took almost a year for him to fulfill his promise due to Ross savoring the moment and waiting for 'the perfect moment' for his boss to wash his car - which finally arrived after a weekend of off-road driving.

The video was recorded by the winner and streamed live to the Kogan company office as well as across the internet

Despite the bet-winning employee saving the moment until his car was dirty from an off-road driving trip, Mr Kogan said he would use similar tactics to encourage his employees to be active in the future

Despite the labour, Mr Kogan said he would definitely use similar tactics again to encourage his team to participate in active events in the future, even laughing that the job took him back to his youth.

'It was all a bit of fun and everyone was a winner – a charity was helped out, we got fitter and one of the staff has one of the cleanest cars in Melbourne,' Mr Kogan said.

'I ran a car wash business when I was 10-years-old, so it was a bit of nostalgia to be honest.

'When I was 10, I was living in housing commission flats in Elsternwick, Melbourne and I used to wash my parents car for $5 once a month, and then we were driving past a billboard one month which was advertising a car wash and it said it would cost only half price of $40 for them to wash your car.

'I saw it and thought "I'm being ripped off here!" So I went door knocking in the area asking people if they wanted their car washed for $15.

'Before I knew it I was booked out every weekend and had to have a couple of mates with me and we'd go around with our backpacks washing these cars.'
