Hong Kong police pepper-sprayed pro-democracy activists today as they tried to storm a venue where a top Government official tried to explain Beijing's decision not to grant the former British colony full democracy.

Scuffles had broken out at the entrance to the Asia World Expo convention centre where Li Fei, deputy secretary general of China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, told delegates that China will not tolerate a local leader who is disloyal to the mainland.

Pro-democracy activists inside the building heckled Li, shouting slogans and interrupting his speech explaining Beijing's decision to rule out a fully democratic election for the city's next leader in 2017.

'Anyone who does not love the country, love Hong Kong or is confrontational towards the central government shall not be the chief executive,' he said.

Rage: Guards dragged a number of pro-democracy activists from the building as they heckled him, shouting slogans and interrupting his speech explaining Beijing's decision to rule out a fully democratic election for the city's next leader in 2017

For suffrage: Hundreds people gathered overnight outside the Hong Kong central government building to protest the decision not to allow universal suffrage

Occupy: Activists from a movement called Occupy Central have threatened to blockade Hong Kong's financial district unless Beijing grants full democracy, setting the stage for disruptive protests in coming weeks 

Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with wide-ranging autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland - a policy called 'one country, two systems'.

The activists want universal suffrage, but Communist Party rulers in Beijing say any candidate for the territory's chief executive has to be approved by a nominating panel - likely to be stacked with pro-Beijing loyalists.

'Occupy Central is an illegal activity. If we give in, it will trigger more illegal activities,' Li said. 

'Lost faith': Dressed in black and wearing yellow ribbons, members of the democratic camp were escorted out of the auditorium after they shouted and held up signs reading 'shameful' and saying Beijing had lost credibility

Anger: Pro-establishment people in the crowd clapped as the democrats were led out 

About 100 activists had gathered for Li's speech, some waving British colonial flags and banners with an 'X' over the Chinese characters for 'communism' amid a heavy police presence

Pro-establishment people in the crowd clapped as the democrats were led out.

Alex Chow, the head of the Hong Kong Federation of Students, was escorted out jeering and heckling. Student activists said they would begin boycotting classes in mid-September and that students at 11 schools had confirmed their participation.

The NPC Standing Committee endorsed a framework to let only two or three candidates run in Hong Kong's 2017 leadership vote. All candidates must first obtain majority backing from the nominating committee

'We want democracy': Li said that if Hong Kong lawmakers failed to approve Beijing's decision, as is needed by law, the city's next leader will be chosen by a small election committee

Unfair: China's decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to get on the ballot and prompted the Occupy Central camp to renew its vow to bring the financial hub to a halt

Tension: Political reform has been a major source of tension in Hong Kong, with China party leaders fearful of calls for democracy spreading to other cities

About 100 activists had gathered for Li's speech, some waving British colonial flags and banners with an 'X' over the Chinese characters for 'communism' amid a heavy police presence.

The issue of democracy has been a constant source of friction between Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement and the mainland since the former British colony was handed back to Communist Party rulers in 1997.

Chris Patten, Hong Kong's last colonial governor who oversaw the transition, was widely hailed as the chief architect of sweeping improvements to the region's equality laws.

In securing the handover, China agreed to govern Hong Kong under the principle of 'one country, two systems', where the city would enjoy 'a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs' for 50 years. 

It included its own legal system, freedom of assembly and freedom of speech - liberties not enjoyed on the mainland. 

But the government reneged on the agreement once Britain had left, implementing an unelected council with few democratic functions. Hong Kong's leader, the chief executive, is currently elected by a 1,200-member election committee, largely loyal to Beijing.

For years activists have agitated for the right to both nominate and vote for Hong Kong's leader, a campaign buoyed by a recent surge in discontent over rising inequality and perceived interference by Beijing.

But their hopes were dashed on Sunday when the standing committee of the National People's Congress announced citizens will only be able to vote from a list of two or three candidates who have obtained the backing of a nominating panel - likely to be stacked with pro-Beijing loyalists.

The decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to get on the ballot and prompted the Occupy Central camp to renew its vow to bring the financial hub to a halt.

Political reform has been a major source of tension in Hong Kong, with China party leaders fearful of calls for democracy spreading to other cities.

The Mainland Affairs Council in self-ruled Taiwan, which China regards as a breakaway province, expressed 'regret' at the NPC's decision while activist groups posted messages of support for the democracy movement online.

'This decision by the NPC to limit the type and number of candidates for Hong Kong's election is a major setback for the progress of Hong Kong's democracy, and we express regret at this decision,' the opposition Democratic Progressive Party said in a statement.

'This decision represents a smothering of the Hong Kong people's demand for truly representative government and casts a shadow over the progress of Hong Kong's democratization.'

Following the publication by Beijing of a white paper outlining China's authority over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on voting in the 'special administrative region', and hundreds of thousands marched to the city's business district and staged a sit-in.

Li's briefing was organised by the Hong Kong government and China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong. The vice chairman of the Standing Committee's Legislative Affairs Commission, Zhang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Feng Wei, were also due to speak in a series of briefings throughout the day.

Student activists said they would gather outside the Hong Kong chief executive's office in the afternoon.

Charles Rivkin, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs, said in Singapore the United States backed 'free and fair elections and transparency'.

'We believe, in the case of Hong Kong, in one country and two systems,' he said.

Britain made no mention of democracy for Hong Kong until the dying days of about 150 years of colonial rule.
