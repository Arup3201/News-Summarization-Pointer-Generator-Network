Eyes on the final: Louis van Gaal is one step away from taking Holland to a World Cup final

Team news: Dutch captain Robin van Persie may miss Holland's World Cup semi-final against Argentina as he is struggling with an upset stomach.

Van Persie has been instrumental in Holland's run to the last four of the tournament, but he had to train separately from his team-mates on Tuesday after complaining of a stomach problem.

There was some good news for the Holland coach on Tuesday as injury doubts Ron Vlaar and Leroy Fer took part in training.

In an interesting development, midfielder Nigel de Jong was also involved even though he had been expected to miss the rest of the World Cup after suffering a groin injury in the group stage win over Mexico.

For Argentina, manager Alejandro Sabella has been boosted by the return of Sergio Aguero from a muscle injury for the semi-final.

Angel Di Maria may be out, but impressive full-back Marcos Rojo returns from suspension.

Key clash: Robin van Persie (Holland) v Ezequiel Garay (Argentina)

Van Persie will be hoping his luck is finally in – he has never scored in the knockout stages of a World Cup and was hugely unlucky not to change that against Costa Rica. Garay will be ready for a physical battle with the Dutch striker but will need to keep an eye on his clever movement and hope Van Persie draws the short straw again.

One to watch: Dirk Kuyt (Holland)

The former Liverpool attacker has been played on either wing and at full-back during the competition so far. His versatility has made him a valuable member of Louis Van Gaal’s squad and he could play an important role helping contain Lionel Messi who loves to cut in from wide positions.
