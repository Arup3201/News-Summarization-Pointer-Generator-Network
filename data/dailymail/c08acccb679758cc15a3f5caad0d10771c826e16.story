It was the book the founder of WikiLeaks said was published to 'screw' him for cash but despite huge publicity surrounding its release it has become a sales flop.

Julian Assange's unauthorised autobiography came out last week but just 644 copies were sold in its first three days in the shops. 

Despite containing the explosive admission by Mr Assange that he slept with the two women accusing him of Category 3 (less serious crime) 'rape' and sexual molestation respectively, it sat at a lowly 537th in 
the UK book chart yesterday.

Memoir: The book is being published by Canongate against Assange's wishes and has sold less than 700 copies in three days

In 2010 Mr Assange's WikiLeaks website catapulted him to world stardom after he published more than 250,000 American diplomatic cables, thousands of which were top secret. 

But his reputation was hit after the Swedish government attempted to extradite the Australian on suspicion of sexual crimes, which he is still fighting.

In this new book, which he was paid £500,000 to be involved in, he claims the women who say they were sexually assaulted did so because they are either part of the American conspiracy or because he failed to return their calls.

'I did not rape those women and can not imagine anything that happened between us that would make them think so, except malice after the fact, a joint plan to entrap me, or a terrible misunderstanding that was stoked up between them,' he said.

Support: Protesters at one of Assange's extradition hearings in London, as many back his publication of government documents

'I may be a chauvinist pig or some sort but I am no rapist, and only a distorted version of sexual politics could attempt to turn me into one. They both had sex with me willingly and were happy to hang out with me afterwards.'

Amongst other sensational claims Assange also says a contact in a Western intelligence agency told him that the American government were considering planting drugs and child pornography or embroiling him 'in allegations of immoral conduct' to get him.

However, after reading the book's first draft, written by Andrew O’Hagan, the 40-year-old tried to prevent its publication saying he had come to the conclusion that ‘all memoir is prostitution’.

Controversy: Mr Assange claims the rape accusations made against him are part of a conspiracy between the U.S. government and the two women

Assange claimed they were 'screwing people over to make a buck' and the book is 'entirely uncorrected or fact-checked by me'.

But British publishers Canongate decided to push ahead and more than 70,000 copies of the now unauthorised autobiography were supplied to bookshops last week.

But despite the huge interest in its release it has sold in relatively small numbers.

'It was only the 50th bestselling hardback non-fiction book of the week, and only the 537th bestselling book overall, sitting directly behind Julia Donaldson's Freddie and the Fairy (Macmillan) and Sharon Kendrick's Satisfaction (Mills & Boon), a £6.99 collection of three short stories featuring "three of her sexiest, most intense Greek heroes and glamorous heroines",' Philip Stone, charts editor at the Bookseller said.

But despite the poor sales the publisher maintains they are not disappointed with the sales.

Canongate publishing director Nick Davies told the Bookseller that is was 'a marathon and not a sprint', and they had 'never made any big predictions about the sales of the Assange book – particularly on the first three days of sale'.

'There was no build-up for the trade, the media or with the reading public. But we're proud of the way we handled what has been a difficult and unusual launch, and we are extremely proud of the book,' he said.

This article was amended on 8 March. An earlier version stated that Mr Assange faced ‘two allegations of rape’. In fact, there is one allegation of Category 3 (less serious crime) 'rape' , the other being of sexual molestation.
