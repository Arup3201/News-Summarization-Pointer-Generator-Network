Mario Mandzukic looks to be heading to England, and could even be Louis Van Gaal’s first signing for Manchester United, after an astonishing bust-up with Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola.

Arsenal and Chelsea are leading the chase for the 27-year old striker, after already making overtures about his availability, but United are ready to compete with them after he was included in their new manager’s list of possible targets.

Either way, Mandzukic is on his way out of the Bundesliga champions after infuriating Guardiola with his attitude and being told by the former Barcelona coach: ‘Goodbye, and good luck with your next club.’

The flare-up happened in the wake of a 4-0 Champions’ League semi-final second-leg defeat by Real Madrid at the Allianz Arena that left the whole of Germany stunned.

As he tried to make sense of it in the home dressing room afterwards, Guardiola launched into an emotional address to the players, in which he blamed himself for blundering over his team selection and getting his tactics wrong.

Every Bayern player was visibly moved by his searing honesty, except for Mandzukic, who evidently shook his head and met his manager’s stare with a mocking smile.

A furious Guardiola reacted by axing him from the squad that beat Borussia Dortmund 2-0 in Saturday’s German Cup final, even though he was fit enough to play.

After settling on his line-up and substitutes last Thursday, he went up to Mandzukic, informed him he was being left out and wished him good luck with his next club.

That could yet be United, after Van Gaal apparently cooled on the idea of pursuing a move for Bayern forward Thomas Muller, who likes to play in a withdrawn role, but set his sights on recruiting an out-and-out goal poacher, in the mould of Mandzukic.

Arsenal, in particular, represent the biggest threat to his hopes, after responding to their FA Cup final triumph by promising Arsene Wenger major transfer backing for a tilt at the Barclays Premier League title next season.
