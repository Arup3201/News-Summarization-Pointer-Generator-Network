A traffic warden's dropped notepad found shows the shocking level of abuse many are subjected to on a daily basis as they go about their work.

A member of the public found the notebook, in which the warden had recorded all the insults he had dealt with in just a few hours, after it fell out of his pocket on the street in Brighton.

The warden's notes show that he was repeatedly sworn at, insulted about his weight, and physically intimidated.

Abuse: The diary of a typical morning recorded a parking warden in Brighton has shown just how aggressive the public are when they are doing their job

His first entry made at 9am read: ‘Van in road, asked driver how long he would be. He said: “What? You too fat to fit through?” I said: “I wasn’t being funny.” It continues: ‘He hurled a ton of abuse at me. He was seven-and-a-half foot.

‘Took no van details as I just got the hell out of there.’

Two hours later a more aggressive exchange was recorded: ‘White retail van in a loading bay since 7.13am. Driver seen. Abuse. Said I was an unreasonable a******. Told me to go **** myself.

‘Drove away and called me a w*****. Parked on zig zags on crossing. 11.07am - ticket issued.’

Hard day at work: The traffic warden in Brighton noted he had 'a ton of abuse' while he was patrolling the streets

Gary Palmer, of the GMB, which represents wardens, said: ‘We have previously raised concerns about how badly civil enforcement officers are treated on the street.

‘This just goes to prove the abuse and intimidation that they face on a daily basis.’

Sussex Police were informed it has been found and it has since returned it to NSL, which runs parking enforcement on behalf of Brighton and Hove City Council
