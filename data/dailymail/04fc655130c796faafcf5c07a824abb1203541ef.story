A heartbreaking letter, which was sent by a Titanic crew member to assure his parents he was 'all right' just days before the ship tragically sank, has sold at auction for $34,000.

British Leonard Taylor, 18, sent the two-page note to his parents in Blackpool, Lancashire on April 9, 1912, six days before the ship hit an iceberg on its way to New York.

Now the hand-written letter - which was found in a box more than 50 years after it was sent - has sold at an auction in Boston,
 America for more than ten times the price for which it was originally sold.

Titanic crew member Leonard Taylor, 18, wrote a letter to his parents in Blackpool, Lancashire, just days before he was killed when the ship sank in the Atlantic. The letter has now been sold at auction for $34,000

The two-page letter, sent by Mr Taylor when the ship had docked in Ireland on 9 April 1912, says: 'I am only writing to let you know that I am alright'

Mr Taylor's nephew Ken Graham from Poulton, Lancashire, had found the rare letter buried away in a box of his mother's belongings in the late 1960s.

He went on to sell the letter 20 years later for around $3,000 - a tenth of the price for which it has now been sold.

The 83-year-old said: 'It's all relative and Â£1,800 was a fair amount of money back then. I am just very proud that it is still of interest and that this is a link to my family that will go on and on.'

Mr Taylor, who worked as a Turkish bar attendant on board the ship, sent the letter to his parents when the ship docked in Ireland on its doomed maiden voyage.

The teenager, who worked as a Turkish bath attendant, was on his first voyage at sea when the Titanic hit an iceberg and sank in the Atlantic

In the hand-written note, the teenager told his parents: 'I am only writing to let you 
know I am all right.'

He then described his 'low wages', the 'good food' and how he was 'very comfortable', before signing it off from 'your loving son, Len'.

But just days later, the teenager died when the ship sank after hitting an iceberg in the Atlantic.

More than 1,500 other people also lost their lives in the tragedy on April 15, 1912.

The letter was then buried away for nearly 50 years until Mr Taylor's sister died.

It was only then that Mr Graham found the historic letter.

The 83-year-old said: 'I remember when I was young, my mother would have people round who had also lost relatives on the Titanic.

'I suppose it was like a support group and they would be meet our house and Mum would cry.

'She often got emotional when she was talking about her brother.

'A lot of time had passed by the time I was born but she did still talk about him from time to time and I could tell she missed him.

"She was definitely proud of him.'

Mr Graham later sold the letter at Sotheby's - an art and private sales auctioneers - where it was bought by an American collector.

He added: 'The irony of it all is that he drowned but he was a champion swimmer.

'When my mum passed away in the late 1960s, my brother gave me a case of her letters and papers and photographs from the house.

'When I was going through them that I found the letter from the Titanic.

'I had no idea it was there. I suppose my mum must have inherited it from her parents and quite naturally kept it in memory of her brother.'
