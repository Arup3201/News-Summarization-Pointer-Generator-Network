Vince Cable slapped down one of his civil service aides over the tweet claiming Evans was 'probably not guilty'

Business Secretary Vince Cable has been forced to rebuke one of his top Whitehall aides for claiming Ched Evans was 'probably not guilty' of rape - despite the footballer being tried and convicted for the crime.

Andy Ormerod-Cloke, Private Secretary to the Business Secretary, made the controversial remark on his personal Twitter account while watching BBC One's Question Time last night.

The Oxford University graduate, said he would 'query how many have looked at the details rather than symbolism of rapist-footballer'. 

He added: 'If guilty then never a footballer again – role model argument – but on the facts of the case, probably not guilty.'

As a civil servant Mr Ormerod-Cloke is not supposed to post messages online about controversial topics.

Official guidance states: 'We should avoid commenting altogether on politically controversial issues and avoid making any kind of personal attack or tasteless or offensive remarks to individuals or groups.'

In April 2012, Evans was jailed for five years for raping a 19-year-old before being released last year.

A spokeswoman for Vince Cable said: 'The member of staff regrets his actions and has apologised. We now consider the matter closed.'

Mr Ormerod-Cloke's remarks, reported in the Telegraph, emerged as Evans hit out at the 'mob' for scuppering his deal to sign for Oldham Athletic.

The disgraced striker, 26, claimed pressure from 'radical elements' meant a new stand at Oldham and several jobs would have been put at risk if had he joined.

It came as the head of the Professional Footballers' Association Gordon Taylor was forced to apologise after he compared the plight of the convicted rapist to the 96 victims of the Hillsborough disaster.

Yesterday Evans apologised to the woman he raped for the first time but maintained he is 'innocent' of attacking her in a Rhyl hotel room in 2011 and said he will appeal the conviction.

And in an attack on those who opposed his return to football with Oldham said: 'Sadly the 'mob rule' tactics employed by the more radical elements of our society and the constant media reporting has had the desired influence on some sponsors and the club would face significant financial pressure if I joined them.

'The most significant issue for me was that owing to the threat of funding opportunities being withdrawn which may jeopardise the building of Oldham's new stand, it would mean that workers would lose their jobs and others would be put at risk - that would simply not be fair.'

Meanwhile Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the PFA, sparked outrage after making the 'insensitive parallel' in a Radio 5 Live interview following the announcement that Evans' move to Oldham had collapsed.

Mr Taylor, 70, told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'He would not be the first person or persons to have been found guilty and maintained their innocence and then been proved right.

Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the PFA, is facing calls to resign after comparing the plight of convicted rapist Ched Evans to  Hillsborough

'If we are talking about things in football we know what happened, what was alleged to have happened at Hillsborough and it's now unravelling and we are finding it was very different to how it was portrayed at the time. Indeed by the police at the time.'

His comments, comparing the problems faced by convicted rapist Evans sparked calls for him to resign.

Responding he said: 'The last thing I intended to do was to upset anybody connected with the Hillsborough case because I've long been a supporter of them .

'So if that's the impression they got it's a totally wrong one and I'm very sorry for that and that's not at all what I intended.

'I was intending to show it as a campaign to prove the reality of what happened and how determined they'd been and how much I admired them. Ched Evans is a totally different case but he has the same belief in his innocence.'

Mr Taylor said it appeared 'very doubtful' Evans would play football in this country again.

'At this moment in time you would have to say you would be very doubtful of that,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today.

'It may well be that he would have to go abroad but at the moment, because he is out on licence he can't go abroad.

'So we need a serious rethink now after the way that this has divided opinion.'

The union boss said the former Wales and Sheffield United striker is in a 'very difficult situation' which has been made worse by Oldham Athletic's decision to scrap a deal to sign him.

He said: 'He's been put through a wringer and the moment you show any sympathy for Ched, everybody will say, 'what about the other parties concerned', and that's why I'm making the point that nobody's forgetting them.
