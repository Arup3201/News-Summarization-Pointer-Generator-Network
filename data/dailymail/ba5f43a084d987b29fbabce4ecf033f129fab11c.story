A wealthy businessman has admitted spending 20 years posing as a distinguished Royal Navy Captain claiming he risked his life for his country during the Falklands War.

Stuart Elliott, managing director of a Hull-based gas turbine company, boasted about being a veteran who served aboard HMS Coventry, a destroyer 
sunk during the Argentine conflict with the loss of 19 crew.

For two decades he turned up to memorial services decorated in medals and in full uniform, recalling stories about the ships he commanded - and even duped Falklands hero Simon Weston who he invited to open his firm's new premises in East Hull, in 2006. He also claimed he had served in two Gulf Wars.

However, the bogus seaman was not quite as clever as he thought he was.

Bogus: Stuart Elliott is pictured dressed as a naval captain wearing medals from the Falklands war but a veteran noticed his medals were in the wrong order and one ribbon was upside down (circled)

Correct: These are the colours of the Navy service ribbon awarded to veterans of the 2003 Iraq War which go khaki, grey, white, red, khaki, but Elliott had his upside down so the colours were the wrong way around

His fantasy was exposed when an 
87-year-old veteran noticed he was wearing his medals in
the wrong order and that one ribbon - awarded to veterans of the 2003 
Iraq war, was displayed upside down.

In reality, the most the 
father-of-three had done was to serve on a Hull tug-boat set to 'mop up'
debris left over from the Falklands war. He was sent to the islands to 
relieve the crew of the Irishman some three weeks after the invading 
Argentine force surrendered to British forces.

However, following a police 
investigation it has emerged that he will not face any criminal charges. 
Despite admitting his deception, he has escaped with a police 
warning.

The punishment has sparked fury among those he duped, including genuine war veterans and Mr Weston who was invited to open Mr Elliott's business.

It is thought Elliott, a married 52-year-old, may have been living his lie for 20 years before officers 
arrested him on suspicion of fraud and offences under the Uniforms Act 
1894.

Elliott was convicted of drink-driving in 2010 and, when applying for his licence back, told the DVLA he was a Captain.

Duped: Elliott claimed to have been a Falklands veteran, like hero Simon Weston who served in the conflict

Despite admitting his deception, Elliott escaped facing a court over his lies and was instead given a police caution.

It was veteran Frank Stevenson who noticed he was wearing his medals in the wrong order and that one ribbon - awarded to veterans of the 2003 Iraq war, was displayed upside down.

Mr Stevenson said he felt honoured when Elliott 
approached him at the Rugby Tavern in Hull, East Yorkshire, following a 
Remembrance Day parade at the city's war memorial in 2010.

The veteran believed he was 
talking to an officer and even asked a friend to take the snap of the handshake.

Stevenson, a pensioner who rose 
through the ranks to become a petty officer on board a warship, said he 
felt sickened and ashamed at being duped by Elliott.

He added: 'I don't think that man would have lasted long during the war.

'Captains are responsible for their crew and their ship. Back then, everyone was scared but you just got on with it.

'I was shocked and disgusted when I 
saw the story in the Mail exposing him. He was certainly very convincing
and had the gift of the gab.'

Stevenson's disgust at Elliott's 
claim was echoed by veterans across the country who had been waiting for
the findings of the police investigation.

Bob Reeves, honorary secretary of
the Royal Naval Association (Hull branch), said he had been invited to 
an Armed Forces Day dinner, adding: 'It was a disgrace what he did. We 
took him at face value and he lied to us.'

A set of 'dolphins', as worn by members of the Royal Navy Submariners Service, was also sported by Elliott.

Both Royal Navy and Military of Defence sources said they had no record of Elliott having ever served.

After he was exposed, Elliott was branded 'Walt' - an abbreviation of the name 'Walter Mitty'.

The name comes from a short story by 
the American comic author James Thurber, The Secret Life of Walter 
Mitty, in which the eponymous hero fantasises about being a military 
hero.

Following an investigation by Humberside 
Police and the Ministry of Defence, Mr Elliott received a verbal caution 
for fraud by false representation in relation to making a false 
declaration to obtain a driving licence.

Mr Elliott, managing director of TC 
Power Ltd, a gas turbine maintenance firm based in Barton-upon-Humber, 
Lincolnshire, issued an apology to veterans through his solicitor.

Max Gold said: 'Mr Elliott had no intention of upsetting or causing harm to any veteran.

'If any veteran has been offended, it is very much regretted. Mr Elliott is genuinely sorry.'

Catherine Ainsworth, District Crown 
Prosecutor, said: 'We advised Humberside Police that the investigation, 
as presented to us, did not reveal sufficient evidence for this case to 
be referred to a crown prosecutor for a charging decision.'

The investigation into Mr Elliott is now closed.
