A star player at the high school football team caught up in a allegations of sick hazing rituals carried out on freshman has lost his scholarship to Penn State University.

Myles Hartsfield, 17, a cornerback in his final year at the beleaguered Sayreville War Memorial School in Parlin, New Jersey, was dropped by coaches today.

Seven players have been charged with sex crimes over allegations that older team members would routinely hold new players down, anally penetrate them with their fingers, then stick it in the boy's mouth.

Young talent: Hartsfield, pictured in 2011, is now considered one of the most promising players in the state, and had several scholarships to choose from

It is not clear whether Hartsfield is one of the players, all aged 15-17, who have been arrested and charged. The names of those charged have not been released because they are all juveniles.

The blow to Hartsfield's career was reported today by BlueWhiteIllustrated, a fan site for the Nittany Lions, Penn State's team.

He has been described as an 'explosive talent' in offense and defense - and had the pick of several scholarships before choosing Penn State.

According to some rankings, he is the 13th most promising player in New Jersey.

'Sick ritual': Sayreville War Memorial High School's football team, some of whose players are pictured above, has been by a hazing scandal. The identities of the players involved is not known

But he, and all his teammates, are now in jeopardy after the season was canceled while investigations take place. 

The scandal widened last night after the area's Superintendent revealed that the hazing may have been going on for years - and said that football may not come back to the school for a very long time.

Sayreville Schools Superintendent Richard Labbe revealed that information gathered by the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Officer suggests the harassment, intimidation and bullying may have taken place before this year in the Bombers' locker room.

Having already suspended the squad for a season, Labbe is now considering extending the ban into 2015 and beyond. 

The scandal has forced the school to call off this season's football as officials consider the future of the team, the coach and the principal. 

More details also emerged about the alleged incident itself - which is claimed to have required seven people at once.

Four boys would pin the freshman down in the locker room, and two would stand guard. The seventh would howl, turn off the lights, then carry out the penetration, according to the new claims.

The description of the attacks, which are alleged to have taken place almost every day from September 19 to 29, was given by an unnamed parent of a football player to NJ Advance Media on Saturday.

He or she described the ritual as 'sickening'. They said: 'Just think if my son or somebody else's son wanted to leave and they either felt overwhelmed by it, [or] they couldn't leave because there was somebody at the door'.

It came as the coach of the team, George Najjar, refused to answer questions to the news website about whether he would resign. He said: 'There will be a time and place when I have something to say, but now is not the time.' 

Three students were charged with aggravated sexual assault, criminal restraint, hazing and other crimes for an act of sexual penetration upon one of the children.

The four other students were charged with aggravated criminal sexual contact and other crimes. 

Those in custody were awaiting a Family Court decision on whether they would be held at a juvenile detention facility or be released to their families. Their names weren't released because of their ages.
