Accused: PC Kayley Newman (pictured leaving Southwark Crown Court) set up a night of passion in a hotel with her lover despite knowing 'full well' that he was wanted for questioning, a trial heard

A police officer set up a secret night of passion with her boyfriend while he was wanted for questioning, a court heard today.

PC Kayley Newman, 25, failed to arrest Dominic Diop, 23, after arranging an illicit rendezvous at the Hotel Ibis London Docklands in east London, Southwark Crown Court was told.

Newman, who was based at Harrow Police Station in north-west London, allegedly knew 'full well' police had been trying to track down her lover since October 25 2011.

She messaged Diop on Facebook to arrange the 'clandestine' tryst before meeting him on November 13 2011, the court heard.

But Diop was not arrested until November 21 when he was recalled to prison to complete an earlier sentence. He was clocked driving dangerously without a licence or insurance while he was at large.

Newman and her lover have admitted exchanging scores of illegal calls and text messages while he was being held at HMP Pentonville in north London between November 21 2011 and January 28 2012.

In one letter to her boyfriend, unearthed after his cell was searched, she wrote: 'It's always fun staying in hotels with you, I get lots of kisses and cuddles and I wear you out', jurors heard.

She penned another note saying: 'I can't believe someone told the police where you were. It makes you not trust anyone doesn't it or trust people you thought were your friends.

'Have you p***** anyone off? It's well bad, someone must not want you around.'

Police wanted to speak to Diop after he was arrested in August 2011 for possession of cannabis while on licence, Claire Howell, prosecuting, said.

A further arrest warrant was issued after he failed to turn up at a hearing at Stratford Magistrates' Court in east London on November 2 in relation to the drug allegations.

Diop was also wanted in relation to two burglaries committed days later on November 4 and 7, jurors heard.

'In November 2011, Kayley Newman arranged a clandestine meeting in a hotel with her then boyfriend,' Ms Howell said.

'The reason she is here is because she was a police officer and he at the time was a wanted criminal.

'She left the hotel and went straight 
back to work that morning and she said not a word to any of her 
colleagues about where she was.

'She knew Dominic Diop and telephone 
evidence makes it clear they were certainly in regular phone contact 
with each other and it is accepted they were in a relationship.

'Certainly they were contacting each other regularly from August 2011.'

The pair arrived at the Hotel Ibis 
separately after Newman booked the suite in her own name, to avoid 
Diop's name being on the hotel records, Ms Howell said.

Newman left the hotel around 6am and 
went straight to a shift at Harrow Police Station at around 8am, while 
Diop checked out at about 9.20am.

'Did she tell any of her colleagues she knew exactly where this man was? No', said Ms Howell.

'Had she done, they would probably 
have been able to go to the hotel and arrest him then and there. The 
prosecution do not need to prove how Kayley Newman knew Dominic Diop was
wanted.

'The prosecution say it's really obvious she knew, in fact, he probably told her and that's how she knew.'

The messages posted by Newman on Facebook demonstrated she was 'well aware' Diop was wanted, Ms Howell said.

'She was loyal to her boyfriend but as
a police officer, Kayley Newman has a responsibility to members of the 
public and she didn't fulfil her responsibility in this case.

'The prosecution say what she did was 
serious, this man was wanted. He went on to commit criminal offences 
because she didn't do her job properly.'

Newman, who has since been sacked, was
arrested on January 31 last year. In a prepared statement, she accepted
spending time with Diop but insisted she didn't know he was wanted at 
the time.

'All the evidence in this case is she knew full well he was a wanted man', added Ms Howell.

Giving evidence, Newman insisted she 
did not know that Diop was wanted by police and claimed he too was 
unaware officers were searching for him.

'It's always fun staying in hotels with you, I get lots of kisses and cuddles and I wear you out'

What Kayley Newman allegedly wrote to Dominic Diop in a letter

She told how her job 'meant a lot to her' and she wouldn't 'throw it away' to meet a wanted suspect.

Smartly dressed in a dark suit, Newman
told the jury: 'I don't believe he knew, I don't think he would meet me
if he knew he was wanted, knowing how much my job means to me.

'I don't think he would have risked coming to meet me.'

But the court heard Diop had arranged for his friends to 'scope out' the hotel prior to their arrival on November 13 2011.

Newman claimed a message to her 
friend, Terri, which said: 'Dom's boys went to the hotel before me to 
check I hadn't told the feds', was nothing more than a joke.

'Dominic likes to think he is a bit of
a gangster and the police want to know everything he is doing,' she 
said. ‘He likes to think he is something special but from my point of 
view I know it's rubbish.'

Newman insisted she was being 
'sarcastic' when questioned about a love letter she wrote to Diop in 
prison, saying: 'I can't believe someone told the police where you were.
It makes you not trust anyone doesn't it, or trust people you thought 
were your friends.'

She told the court: 'He always said his friends were like family and I was saying you can't trust them.'

But the jury heard the letter also 
said: ‘I miss you so bad, I just want you here. I promise I will wait 
for you and make you happy, as long as you promise to be good in there 
and write to me every day.'

Newman and Diop exchanged more than 
1,000 calls and text messages after he was recalled to prison to 
complete an earlier sentence for robbery, jurors heard.

'I miss you so bad, I just want you here. I promise I will wait for you and make you happy'

What Newman allegedly told Diop

Cross examining Newman, prosecutor Claire Howell told her: 'You felt loyalty to him (Diop), didn't you?'

Newman replied: 'Not as far as my job 
was concerned. My job means a lot to me, more than to throw my job away 
to meet someone who was wanted.'

She insisted she would have alerted her supervisor had she been aware Diop was being hunted.

Newman also claimed she was unaware 
that she was committing a crime by having conversations with Diop on an 
illicit mobile phone while he was behind bars.

Ms Howell said: 'You pleaded guilty to
having over 1,000 calls with Mr Diop while he was in prison using a 
mobile phone, which was a criminal offence.

She replied: 'I was not aware calling 
Dominic back on his mobile phone was illegal. I was aware you are not 
allowed to have a mobile phone in prison and that's why I pleaded guilty
to that offence.'

But Ms Howell told Newman: 'If your 
job means so much to you, you would not have been calling a prisoner on 
an illegal mobile phone more than 1,000 times.'

Newman, of Barnet, north London, 
denies misconduct in a public office. She and Diop, of East Ham, east 
London, have admitted conspiracy to cause the transmission of an image 
or sound from prison.

The trial continues.
