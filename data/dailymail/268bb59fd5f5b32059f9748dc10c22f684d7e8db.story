Tommy Sheldon, five, pictured, died yesterday despite medics battling for two weeks to save his life

A five-year-old boy who died after being badly burned in a dramatic car fire, may have been murdered police said today.

Detectives released this first picture of young Tommy Sheldon, who spent two weeks fighting for his life in hospital before succumbing yesterday to his injuries.

Tommy and his six-year-old sister were dragged from the blaze by brave passers-by after the vehicle exploded into flames.

The schoolboy was airlifted to hospital following the incident on August 11, but police said today that he had died yesterday and the investigation was now a murder inquiry.

His sister and 37-year-old mother were still in hospital receiving treatment. No arrests have been made in relation to the fire and its cause was still being investigated.

Detectives said 'all options are being considered', including whether the fire was started on purpose.

Detective Inspector Simon Baker said: 'Despite Tommy's battle to survive his injuries, sadly he has lost his fight for life.

'This tragic news means that our investigation now becomes a murder inquiry.

'Our thoughts are with the family and friends of those who have been affected by this distressing incident and specially-trained officers are continuing to support them at this difficult time.

'The nature of the injuries suffered by all those involved and the need to ensure their health and recovery takes priority, means that this will be a lengthy investigation spanning many weeks.'

Police, paramedics and the fire brigade raced to the scene in Merdon Castle Lane, Hursley, near Winchester, Hampshire., just after 8pm on August 11 after passers-by reported seeing the blazing Ford Fiesta.

'It was well alight and there were two people in the road, a woman and a young girl,' said Mr Beusmans, a grandfather of three, aged 64 years.

'We thought we'd run to assist the lady, who had flames coming up around her legs.

'She was pointing towards the car and that was when I saw the other kid.

'I went over to the car and managed to get the door open - the boy was pressed up against the window.

'I burned my hand opening it and the boy fell out of the car, I got him over to the other side.

'They were very distressed and I was shocked at what I saw but I managed to get myself together.

'You never expect anything like this to happen.'

A post mortem examination was due to be held to establish the cause of Tommy's death.

Tommy, his sister and mother were all from Southampton, Hampshire.
