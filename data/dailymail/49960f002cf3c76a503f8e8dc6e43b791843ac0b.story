Boris Johnson has dismissed David Cameron as a ‘girly swot’ because he got a first class degree.

The London Mayor, who got a 2:1 degree in classics from Balliol College Oxford, lashed out after he was teased about the Prime Minister’s greater academic accomplishment.

Quizzed about Mr Cameron and his brother Jo Johnson - now head of Mr Cameron’s policy board - both of whom got firsts in Philosophy, Politics and Economics, the Mayor pointed out that he won a scholarship and they did not.

In an interview with the London Evening Standard, he then branded his rivals: ‘Girly swots who wasted their time at university.’

Mr Johnson and Mr Cameron have been rivals since they were at Eton College together and members of the exclusive Bullingdon Club dining society at Oxford.

The Mayor made the comments as he unveiled a document on the future of the capital.

The 11,000 word paper calling for more transport and house building was entitled ‘Ambitions for London’ but was quickly dubbed ‘Ambitions for Boris’ in Westminster, where MPs viewed it as an exercise in promoting the Mayor.

At a press conference to mark the publication, Mr Johnson joked about the widespread belief that he wants to be Prime Minister when his mayoral term is up in 2016.

He called for the building of Crossrail 2, linking North and South London, a project that will take years.

‘I’m not going to be there to cut the ribbon for Crossrail 2,’ he said. ‘At least not as Mayor ... or indeed as anything else.’

The Mayor provocatively admitted that he has enjoyed a pint and ‘a very amusing time’ with UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage.

Mr Johnson then launched a bizarre defence of MPs who have been caught in recent lobbying scandals.

Conservative MP Patrick Mercer resigned from the Tory Party after he took £4,000 from undercover reporters to ask Parliamentary questions.

And Tim Yeo, chairman of the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee quit his post after he admitted, in another media sting, that he had coached a green company he was paid to advise how to answer questions to his committee.

But Mr Johnson leapt to their defence.

He said: ‘What I feel ... this is going to get me into trouble, but I do feel a certain amount of sympathy with all these poor MPs who end up thinking they are having some jovial lunch in which they are hysterically exaggerating their ability to do things.

‘As if an MP would tell you whether he is actually any use or knows anyone or if there is any point in his existence, honestly.’

Mr Johnson may have taken the view that his leadership ambitions would be boosted by sympathising with embattled MPs who have been thrown to the wolves by Mr Cameron.

The Mayor also alluded to a recent court ruling that lifted reporting restrictions about the fact that he fathered a love child. His document warns of a future ‘population explosion’ in the capital.

In his press conference, Boris said the population of London has risen by at least 380,000 since he became Mayor ‘no thanks to me’.
