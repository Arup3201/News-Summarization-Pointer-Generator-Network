Fizzy drinks and sweet treats should be doubled in price to prevent an epidemic of tooth decay, according to researchers.

They are calling for a 100 per cent sugar tax to be slapped on soft drinks and confectionary to deter the public from consuming such vast quantities.

Earlier this year the chief medical officer Professor Dame Sally Davies conceded that a sugar tax may be necessary to tackle obesity although ministers say there are no plans for such measures.

Figures show that 500 children are admitted to hospital every week with rooting teeth and more than a quarter of youngsters have some degree of decay 

But researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Medicine say it is urgently needed to prevent rotting teeth in adults and children.

They say the NHS now spends more treating tooth decay than any other illness apart from cancer and it causes so much pain it severely impacts patients’ quality of life.

Professor Philip James, lead researcher, said a number of drastic proposals were needed including sugar tax of at least 20 per cent but ideally 100 per cent.

This would raise the price of a can of Coke to 84p, a Mars bar to £1.20 and a Cornetto ice cream to £2.50.

Writing in the journal BMC Public Health, he also called for other drastic measures including schools to stop serving fruit juice and vending machines to be banned from public places.

Professor James said: ‘A sugars tax should be developed to increase the cost of sugar-rich food and drinks.

‘This would be simplest as a tax on sugar as a mass commodity, since taxing individual foods depending on their sugar content is an enormously complex administrative process.

‘The retail price of sugary drinks and sugar rich foods needs to increase by at least 20 per cent to have a reasonable effect on consumer demand so this means a major tax on sugars as a commodity.

‘The level will depend on expert analyses but my guess is that a 100 per cent tax might be required.

Two cans of fizzy drinks and the 20 teaspoons of sugar they contain - the chief medical officer Professor Dame Sally Davies conceded that a sugar tax may be necessary to tackle obesity

‘Vending machines offering confectionery and sugary drinks in areas controlled or supported financially by local or central government should be removed.

‘We are not talking draconian policies to ‘ban’ such sugar-rich products, which are available elsewhere, but no publicly-supported establishment should be contributing to the expensive problems of dental caries, obesity and diabetes.’

‘We need to make sure that use of fruit juices and the concept of sugar-containing treats for children are not only no longer promoted, but explicitly seen as unhelpful.’

He also said nurseries and schools should stop serving sugar-rich drinks including fruit juice and treats.

The Government says it has no plans for a sugar tax and instead is working with food and drinks manufacturers to make products less sweet.

Only yesterday, American researchers said that sugar – not salt- was to blame for high blood pressure.

Dr James DiNicolantonio, a heart disease specialist at Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City, said it affects a key area of the brain that causes the heart rate to quicken.
