Invented by a strict teetotaler, Bovril was once used as a flu treatment and seriously considered as a nourishing alternative to alcohol.

Now as it turns 125 years old, the iconic brand - invented by Scotsman John Lawson Johnston in 1873 - has unveiled three limited edition, old-fashioned jars to celebrate the landmark anniversary.

Each one has a vintage illustration and old advertising slogans used to sell the 'fluid beef' concocted as a way of feeding soldiers during the Franco-Prussian War.

Bovril has unveiled three limited edition, old-fashioned-style jars to celebrate its 125th birthday

Retro adverts from the 1920s, 1930s and 1960s give the the jars a nostalgic feel

As Marmite introduces its new 'End Neglect' campaign, Bovril has brought out one of its own - bringing back retro adverts from the 1920s, 1930s and 1960s. 

The iconic adverts are integral to the history of Bovril - and one of the historic ads with the tag lines 'Bovril prevents that sinking feeling' harks back to a time when the beefy drink was being used by doctors to help treat influenza.

One advert is the iconic bull looking at a jar of the meat extract with the caption 'Alas, my poor brother!' and another shows a pyjama-clad man with the caption 'Don't forget the Bovril!' on it. 

Bovril was invented  after French President Napoleon III ordered one million cans of beef to feed his soldiers during the Franco-Prussian War.

Because transporting the beef was so problematic inventor Johnston came up with Bovril as an alternative and it was originally known as 'Johnston's Fluid Beef'.

Because Britain didn't have enough beef stocks to fill the millions of kilogram tins the French required, Johnston moved to Canada and founded the company and built a factory in Sherbrooke, Quebec.

Johnston, who was a strict teetotaller, worked on his invention and saw his 'fluid beef' as a practical alternative to alcohol.

By 1884, Johnston's fluid beef became a huge success in Canada and he sold the business to move to London.

With only two staff, Johnston set up a small factory and started to produce his fluid beef under a new name - Bovril.

In 1888, over 3,000 bars and pubs had started serving Bovril and by a year later, it had a share capital of £150,000.

The meat drink became a huge favourite and was regularly shipped off to overseas troops and even Norwegian polar explorers.

In 1892 doctors prescribed Bovril for the influenza epidemic.

The meat extract is  popular among football fans, who enjoy the drink on chilly days while watching the game

By 1900, advertising for Bovril had reached as far as Africa and South America and by 1909, Bovril had land in Argentina and Australia.

In the late 20th century it became immensely popular when enough of it was sold to make over 90 million mugs of it.

The meat extract is now extremely popular among football fans, who enjoy the drink on chilly days while watching the game.

Laura Grant, from Bovril, said: 'Bovril is a truly British brand that has stood the test of time, so it's great to pay tribute to its heritage through these three limited edition jars.

'We hope Bovril fans of all ages will enjoy this retrospective look at the brand they know and love, while enjoying the same, classic taste of beef Bovril.'
