The number of ways Australians can die down under 

Australians living in fear of spiders, snakes or man-eating sea monsters can now add bees, jellyfish, cats, camels and just about every animal under the sun to their list of do-not-encounter creatures.

While many Australians and overseas tourists regard those deadly animals swimming in our seas and rivers the most dangerous, statistics reveal a much different side to the story.

A decade-long breakdown of 254 animal-related deaths by the National Coronial Information System reveal more people died down under from horses and cows than any other animal. 

The statistics have been used to promote a new Australian parody of the US film to be released on DVD this week  'A Million Ways To Die In The West.'

The Australian take on the Seth MacFarlane film is called 'A Million ways To Die in Australia's West,' and it delves into the more insane ways people have died down under - such as tripping over cats or being mauled by the animals on our national emblem.

Sydney Wildlife expert David Whitehill said while many of the ways people have died on the list are true, there is also a number of long-held myths such as dying by drop attacks that tourists still believe happens. 

'A lot of it is tongue and cheek,' he said.

'But it's quite interesting to hear people's perception of different Australian animals and to hear how people have died.'

He said the most dangerous animals he still hears about are spiders and sharks, 'but the animal that has been the most dangerous and caused the most deaths is the horse,' he said. 

Seventy-seven of the 254-related deaths have been attributed to horses, donkeys or ponies according to the NCIS, and one person died by tripping on a cat.

The actual cause of the horse-related fatalities vary but falling or being trampled account for the vast majority. 

Horses along with cows, bulls, kangaroos, ostriches, emus and bovine animals were also responsible for a good number of motor vehicle accident fatalities between them.

Others, including fish, sheep, goats, camels, cats and jellyfish have accounted for 39 deaths - 26 more than sharks and 32 more than crocodiles.

Queensland is our most dangerous state for animal deaths followed buy NSW and Victoria.

Mr Whitehill said because of Australia's isolated place in the world travellers perceive it as this 'dangerous playground.'

'Reality is though that unless you go looking for these animals and cross their path you're unlikely to see them.'

'Definitely though if you step out of your comfort zone of the cities there are these animals out there.'

He said they create 'fascinating' stories and are part of the allure for travellers visiting  Australia.

'I've had the opportunity to travel to every continent across the planet with and it is without doubt something Australians do really well.'

Even drop bears got a mention in the NCIS statistics for 'killing or injuring a few tourists.'

'But surprisingly no Aussies have ever encountered one.' 

Mr Whitehill did say though that there is an element of truth to some of the stories that to get told about Australia's animal folklore and that people should be wary of certain situations.

'Obviously the salt water croc is a major danger and needs to be taken seriously,' he said.
