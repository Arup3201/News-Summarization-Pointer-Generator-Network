Christina Aguilera is among the unlikely inclusions in a new list of record releases worth a small fortune to collectors.

The What A Girl Wants warbler joins Muse, Gorillaz and Keane in the list of recent releases, most of them on vinyl, which change hands for hundreds of pounds.

Aguilera's Back To Basics release from just eight years ago - released alongside CD as a limited edition triple vinyl package - weighs in at £100.

Worth a ton: Christina Aguilera's Back to Basics triple vinyl releases now changes hands for as much as £100, according to a new list of valuable modern records compiled by the experts at Record Collector magazine

Record Collector editor Ian McCann 
said: 'It's common knowledge that some Beatles records can be worth a 
packet, and that you should never throw out original rock albums from 
the 1960s and 70s without finding out whether they are valuable.

'But
 few people realise that more recent vinyl albums can also be highly 
collectable, with fans desperate to obtain copies of albums by the likes
 of Radiohead, Arctic Monkeys and Keane as they were only pressed in 
very limited numbers because most buyers wanted these albums on CD or as
 downloads.

'It's about supply and demand: the print run was low, and demand is now high.'

The
 list of 51 modern rarities, dubbed 'New Money' by Record Collector 
magazine, includes the début Muse album Showbiz, Keane's first album 
Hopes And Fears and Demon Days by Gorillaz, also each valued at £100 on 
vinyl.

Kate
 Bush's 2005 album Aerial is another which the list's creator Ian 
Shirley - who edits the Rare Record Price Guide - puts at £100.

Oddly enough, almost mint copies of The Dreaming, her LP from more than two decades earlier, can be had for as little as £8.

Pretty pricey: Muse's debut album Showbiz and Demon Days by Gorillaz also shift for around the £100 mark

Music collectibles lists tend to be dominated by classic early releases or obscure cult acts, but Record Collector's latest list focuses solely on rare releases out since 2000.

And it shows that popularity and chart success are no deterrent to the hardcore music collector - it is usually the scarcity of limited edition versions which has added to their value.

A box set by Blur called Blur 21, drawing together each of their album releases, now attracts a price of £200 on vinyl.

Their Britpop rivals Oasis attract £300 for the 2009 collection of each of their albums, according to the list to be published in the Record Collector's May edition.

Among the more esoteric entries is the incidental music from children's show The Clangers, with the 26 copies which came in a knitted sleeve going for around £125.

And a 12in single by Jack White called Sixteen Saltines - said to have been the world's first liquid-filled record - is listed at £300.

The most expensive item on the list is Bob Dylan's The 50th Anniversary Collection which came out in 2012 and was limited to just 100 copies on four CD-R discs.

They were pressed to extend the copyright of the material recorded in 1962 and are estimated to be worth £600.

THE 50th ANNIVERSARY COLLECTION (4CD-R, 2012, Son, no cat no) £600

While most releases covered in this list are vinyl, this 4CD-R set cannot be ignored. It was 'released' in a limited edition of 100 copies to ensure that Sony could renew its copyright of Dylan material – including six versions of Mixed Up Confusion – that was originally recorded in 1962. In other words, they stopped it falling into the public domain.

DEATH MAGNETIC (white vinyl box set, US, 2008, Warner Bros 512119-1) £500

Death Magnetic was the ninth studio album by Metallica.

SOUNDTRACK FROM THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME (4LP 180g expanded edition, 2008, Rhino/Atlantic/Swan Song 8122799489) £500

The Song Remains the Same is the soundtrack live album of the concert film of the same name by Led Zeppelin. The album was originally released in October 1976, before being remastered and re-issued in 2007.

SIXTEEN SALTINES (12” 2012 Third Man TMR 137) £300

The only shop selling this beauty on Record Store Day in 2012 was Jack White’s Third Man outlet in Nashville, Tennessee. The fuss is because this 12in is the world’s first liquid-filled record. It’s estimated that only 400 were made. Some have leaked!

LP BOX SET  (2009, Big Brother RKIDBOX 58) £300

What you get in this box set is every album the Gallagher brothers recorded. The box was limited to 1,500 numbered copies and the majority have probably never been removed from their shrink-wrap.

BLOOD LUST (LP+7”, 2011, Rise Above RISELP 139) £250

In just a few short years, Uncle Acid went from nowhere to supporting Black Sabbath on their 2013 world tour. The price for pressings on purple vinyl – with no 7” – is £100, and you can expect to pay around £20 for dark-as-Hades black wax.

THE SHUTTERED ROOM (LP, 2011, Trunk RSD 001) £200

There are just 29 vinyl copies of the Basil Kirchin soundtrack to this classic British horror film in existence, pressed up a few years ago by Trunk Records. The LP has an embossed logo on the cover and hand-stamped artwork plus an insert explaining its origins.

OPUS EPONYMOUS (Box set, 2010, Rise Above RISELP 124) £200

This debut album by a Swedish doom band has been hailed as a classic and put them on the map worldwide, with recent follow-up, Infestissumam (2013), cementing their reputation. There was a mind-boggling number of limited-edition coloured vinyl variants of Opus – as well as a gamut of re-pressings to sate demand. But this is the mother - collectable black vinyl edition in a box that contains a patch and a massive A1-sized poster. There were only 300.

BLUR 21 (Box Set, 2012, EMI BLURBOXLP 1) £200

This box set, released to mark Blur's 21st anniversary, features the band's seven studio albums on heavyweight vinyl, each of the LPs repackaged as a double album except for Leisure, a single album.

GET BEHIND ME SATAN (LP, 2005, XL XLLP 191 P) £150

Get Behind Me Satan is the fifth album by American alternative rock band The White Stripes, released on June 7, 2005, on V2 Records.
