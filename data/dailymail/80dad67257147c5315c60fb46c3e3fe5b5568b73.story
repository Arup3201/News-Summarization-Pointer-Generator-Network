Spotlight: Newsnight reporters who led the 
investigation said that Mr Rippon had initially been enthusiastic about 
the programme

The Newsnight editor embroiled in a decision to axe the Jimmy Savile sex abuse probe tried to kill the investigation saying: 'It was 40 years ago... the girls were not too young', it has been alleged.

Channel 4 News said it had seen an email
 sent last December by Newsnight reporter Liz MacKean to a friend in which she 
discusses Newsnight editor Peter Rippon's response to her investigation 
into Savile.

Mr Rippon stepped aside from his job on 
Monday after the BBC said his explanation of why Newsnight dropped its 
Savile investigation was 'inaccurate or incomplete'.

In the email, Ms MacKean wrote: 'Having commissioned the story, Peter Rippon keeps saying he's lukewarm about it and is trying to kill it by making impossible editorial demands.'

She reportedly claimed: 'When we rebut his points, he resorts to saying, well, it was 40 years ago ... the girls were teenagers, not too young ... they weren't the worst kind of sexual offences etc.'

Ms MacKean, who appeared on the BBC's Panorama documentary last night, said she believed Mr Rippon did not tell BBC1, which was planning to run Savile tributes, about the investigation.

'He hasn't warned BBC1 about the story, so they're beavering away on the special, oblivious,' she wrote.

BBC director-general George Entwistle
 has since come under fire for not dropping the BBC's Savile tributes 
when he was head of BBC Vision, despite knowing that Newsnight had 
investigated the former TV star.

Today, speaking before MPs at the 
Culture, Media and Sport Committee, Mr 
Entwistle said Mr Rippon acted alone in deciding to can the 
investigation.

He insisted there was no 'managerial pressure' and said he believed the investigation should have continued.

Abuse: Just days after Savile died last year aged 84 an investigation into the paedophile claims was started 

In a statement to Channel 4 News in 
response to Ms MacKean email, the BBC said: 'The BBC has confirmed it has 
launched an independent review lead by former head of Sky News Nick 
Pollard which will cover these questions.

When Savile died aged 84 in October 
last year, Newsnight spent six weeks investigating allegations that the Top 
Of The Pops presenter abused pupils from Duncroft school in Surrey at 
the height of his fame in the 1970s.

BBC journalists spoke to at least 
four women who claimed they had been abused or had knowledge of abuse at
 the school, which shut in 1980. One witness was Karin Ward, who 
claims she was abused by Savile when she was 14 and he invited her up 
to London.

Newsnight reporters said that Mr Rippon had initially been enthusiastic about 
the programme, praising as ‘excellent’ their discovery that in 2007 the 
police had investigated allegations of child sex by Savile, but suddenly
 went cold on the story.

On October 2 Mr Rippon published 
detailed reasons in a blog on the BBC website for why he pulled the plug
 on the programme just days before it was due to be aired. He wrote that
 Newsnight had no evidence against the BBC.

But yesterday, the BBC issued a 
series of corrections to Mr Rippon's blog after labelling it 
'inaccurate', and announced Mr Rippon had stood down.
