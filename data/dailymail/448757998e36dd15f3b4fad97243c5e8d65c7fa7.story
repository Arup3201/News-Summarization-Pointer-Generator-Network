Four people have been arrested on suspicion of murder after a young man was stabbed to death in a street fight between two sets of motorists.

The man, named locally as Daniel Sommerville, was knifed after a brawl broke out between the occupants of a black Vauxhall Corsa and a dark coloured van yesterday afternoon.

The two groups involved were understood to have known each other previous to the fight and Mr Sommerville, aged in his 20s, was rushed to hospital in the van with severe stab wounds, but died a short while later.

Four people have now been arrested on suspicion of murder after Mr Sommerville died from the stab wounds

A man and two women, all in their 20s, were arrested shortly after the brawl in Aldershot Road, Guildford, Surrey, on suspicion of his murder, while another man was arrested in London this morning.

Officers probing the murder had earlier cordoned off a large area of the road whilst forensic experts in blue boiler suits and white face masks scoured the scene for clues.

A post mortem examination on his body is due to take place in the coming days.

Today there was an outpouring of grief from Mr Sommerville's friends and family members.

Julie Liddicott said: 'My life or my family’s will never ever be the same again... I love you Dan with all my heart.'

Kris Lukic said: 'He was a funny guy and always made me laugh, it was many years ago since I properly spoke to him but have bumped into him on a few occasions.

'My thoughts are with all his family. I know he will be missed by many. RIP Little Dan.'

Another friend posted on Facebook: 'Why does it have to be true!? He was so kind, lovely and did so much for my brother. Now he’s just gone, it doesn’t seem real. RIP Dan, you will be missed by absolutely everyone.'

Detective Chief Inspector Fiona Macpherson from Surrey Police said: 'This is a tragic incident which has led to the death of a young man and our thoughts and sympathies are with his family and friends at this time.

'We are carrying out a number of inquiries in the local area to establish the full circumstances of what happened.

'I would ask anyone who was in the Aldershot Road area (yesterday) afternoon and may have seen the two vehicles or the altercation taking place to contact police as a matter of urgency.'

They said that officers were not treating the suspected murder as a road rage incident at this time.
