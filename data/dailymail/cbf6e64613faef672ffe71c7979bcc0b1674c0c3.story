A British fitness instructor plunged to his death from a high-rise building in Dubai less than three months after getting married.

Former Royal Navy sailor Elwood McIlwraith, 29, who described himself as a 'massive sports player and into everything from football to athletics', fell from the 42-storey Laguna Tower in Jumeirah Lakes Towers district.

The exact circumstances surrounding his death early on Saturday morning remain shrouded in mystery and it is not clear if he lived in the building where he fell.

Dubai police are investigating.

Just married: British fitness instructor Elwood McIlwraith, pictured with his wife Susie on their wedding day in February, plunged to his death from the 42-storey Laguna Tower in Dubai's Jumeirah Lakes Towers district

Mr McIlwraith, from Kingston-upon-Hull, East Yorkshire, had just married his partner Susie on February 21 this year. Both he and his wife have a picture of their wedding day on their Facebook profile page.

The devastated widow is now being comforted by colleagues from his gym, Smart Fitness, where he had worked for about two years.

The muscly fitness coach, who specialised in training women to high levels of fitness, joined the Royal Navy after leaving school and remained in the military for five years, serving in the Gulf for nine months in 2005.

While in the military he had had played a number of sports and completed a diploma in fitness training in Australia.

On one of a number of videos posted on YouTube, he said: 'Since then, I have been a personal trainer and never looked back.

'I get a good result with female clients. I'm a no-nonsense person when it comes to training but at the same time, I make it fun.'

Last August he poignantly wrote on Facebook: 'You have on average 28,000 days on this planet.

'Live every day to the fullest. Never regret anything, learn from it and move on. Don't put off things till tomorrow, make that change today.

'Life is too short.'

Mr McIlwraith's fatal fall is the third of its kind in as many months in Dubai involving British expats.

Last month Emirates airline stewardess Evelyn Clarke, 30, fell to her death from a tall building.

And Abbie Emmett, 27, plunged from the window of her fourth-floor honeymoon suite after a night out with her new husband, motorcycle champion Sean Emmett, 43.

Mr McIlwraith moved to Dubai two years ago and began working at Smart Fitness shortly after it opened.

His colleagues were left shocked by his sudden death.

'He was a very popular guy and got good results with his clients,' said one.

'We can only think this has been a tragic accident. There is no other reason for it.

'He was deliriously happy in his work and with his wife.'

In a statement, the company, which is located in the same Jumeirah Lakes Towers district where Mr Elwood died, said: 'On Saturday, we lost a very special member of the Smart Fitness family.

'Elwood was a founder trainer who played a big part in helping make Smart Fitness what it is today.

'He brought tremendous energy and warmth to the gym and his genuine kindness made everyone feel comfortable irrespective of their fitness level.

'He was such a talented personal trainer that he had the ability to encourage people to go beyond their limits and achieve results they wouldn’t have thought were possible.

'It’s so hard for us to imagine the gym and Smart camps without his smile, encouragement and dodgy banter.'

Tragic: Mr McIlwraith is the third British ex-pat in as many months to fall to his death in Dubai. His devastated widow Susie, pictured right, is reportedly being comforted by friends at his gym Smart Fitness

Friends back in Hull have also paid tribute to Mr McIlwraith on social networking sites. On Facebook, Phil Owst said: 'My thoughts go out to his family and wife through this sad time.

'RIP my friend, you will be sorely missed.'

Gerry Harkins said: 'Mate, I will never forget the first time I met you. An inspiration to so many people, will never forget you, big guy.'

Mark Thistleton said: 'RIP Elwood McIlwraith, you will be missed. Can’t believe you’re gone pal.'

Mr McIlwraith, a former pupil from Malet Lambet comprehensive in Kingston upon Hull, leaves a sister Melanie, a fitness trainer at Xercise4Less in his home town, mother Tracy Collinson and grandfather Don Smallwood.
