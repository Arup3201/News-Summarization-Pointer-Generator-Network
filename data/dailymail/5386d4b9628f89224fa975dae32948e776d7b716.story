The winner of the Sprite Slam Dunk Contest at NBA All-Star Weekend nearly cracked his head on the rim while soaring to victory.

Zach LaVine of the Minnesota Timberwolves took top honors during the annual contest by scoring 194 out of a possible 200 with his four dunks. 

The 19-year-old rookie beat out Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks, Mason Plumlee of the Brooklyn Nets and Victor Oladipo of the Orlando Magic in front of a sellout crowd at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, last night.

LaVine is the second-youngest player in history to win the dunk contest.

Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers won when he was just 18, according to Sports Illustrated.

The 2014 lottery pick said he will 'hopefully' compete in the contest next year and paid tribute to past winners like Bryant, Vince Carter and Michael Jordan.

He said: 'Vince Carter is above me. I don't want to get in that area.'

Mason Plumlee of the Brooklyn Nets had a hometown advantage during the context, but still couldn't win it

Victor Oladipo of the Orlando Magic came the closest to defeating LaVine, but came up short in the end

Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks, the 'Greek Freak', disappointed during the contest 

LaVine scored a perfect 100 in the opening round by performing a 'Space Jam' dunk while wearing a No. 23 Jordan jersey and then executing a self alley-oop followed by a one-handed slam.

He followed that up by totaling 94 in the final round (with dunks that scored 45 and 49) to beat Oladipo.

The UCLA product became the first Wolves player to win the contest since Isaiah Rider in 1994.

He said: 'I'm still on cloud nine. I feel like I'm dreaming.

'Seeing all the dunk contests and people hoisting the trophy, I just saw myself do it and lived it. 

'So it's a dream come true. I'm glad my family is here to witness it and go through it.'

Steph Curry of the Golden State Warriors was the other big winner on the night after he emerged as the top marksman during the Three-Point Shootout. 

He topped Golden State teammate Klay Thompson and six others to win the contest.

Curry scored 27 points in the final round and buried 13 consecutive shots.

He only missed his final attempt. 

It was Curry's first win in the shootout after competing three times previously.
