Mementoes: Possessions of the late Clarissa Dickson Wright are being sold to clear her debts

A lifetime of quirky mementoes collected by celebrity cook and bombastic pro-hunting campaigner Clarissa Dickson Wright are going under the hammer this week to clear her debts.

Items to be auctioned off include unusual antique kitchen gadgets, her cherished collections of ceramic pigs – and even a scrawled bomb threat from an anti-bloodsport extremist.

Thursday’s sale is expected to raise more than £30,000 – more than enough to cover an outstanding £17,000 tax and funeral bill. Clarissa, half of TV’s Two Fat Ladies, left just £8,000 when she died aged 66 in March.

Among the antique books, countryside paintings and personal items are her scruffy size seven walking boots, expected to raise about £40, an unusual citrus peel slicer (£40), a Victorian ham boiler (£25) and a silver marrow scoop (£80) used to eat bone marrow.

Country pursuit items include a stirrup cup shaped with a hare’s head (£40) a hunting knife (£70) and a print of flying pigs named after Clarissa’s pet hates, Defra [the Department for Rural Affairs], Tony [Blair’s] Promises and Supermarkets, £10 to £20.

Clarissa inherited a fortune but became an alcoholic and was three times bankrupt. Her friend David Morris said: ‘Clarissa was extraordinarily generous and I wasn’t surprised she left very little. But she wished her debts to be settled and the best option was a sale. You will see from the items Clarissa lived a humble life.’

The items are being sold by Carlisle-based Thomson, Roddick & Medcalf.

Picture of youth: Clarissa grew up in St John's Wood, London, in grandeur. Her neighbour, distinguished artist Joseph Oppenheimer, sketched this pastel 

Double barrelled: Clarissa never used this gun cleaning kit, considering a bit of country muck as a badge of honour 

Tools of the trade: They look like instruments of torture, but this lot comprises 19th Century kitchen implements 

Time to cook: This fun chef's watch has whisk and spatula hands and a face decorated with moulds. Three times bankrupt Clarissa also collected pigs and piggy banks, including this tartan example (right).
