Juventus are weighing up a loan move for Liverpool's Fabio Borini or Chelsea forward Romelu Lukaku after new signing Alvaro Morata was ruled ouf for six weeks.

Massimilano Allegri's pre-season preparations took a blow when the Spaniard sustained knee ligament damage in his first training session following his move from Real Madrid.

And with their first Serie A match less than a month away the Bianconeri are considering a short-term loan to counter Morata's injury, according to CalcioNews24.

Setback: Morata only arrived in Italy on Sunday after his £15.8m move from Real Madrid

Borini, who looked on the verge of joining Sunderland for £14million after a successful loan spell last season, is believed to be Juventus' primary target.

Whether Liverpool allow the Italian to go out on loan again remains to be seen, with the Anfield club set to favour a permanent sale.

The Turin giants have also been linked with Lukaku, who has endured a difficult time under Jose Mourinho and could see his first-team opportunities limited by the recent arrival of Diego Costa from Atletico Madrid.

The Belgium international is reportedly close to a move to Everton, but the lure of Champions League football may sway his decision should Juventus make a concrete offer.

Uncertain: Future of Southampton forward Dani Osvaldo is unclear after he failed to return for pre-season

A third choice for Juventus could be to bring back Dani Osvaldo from Southampton, after the Italian spent the latter half of last season on loan at Juventus Stadium.

Southampton boss Ronaldo Koeman confirmed they are trying to offload club-record transfer Osvaldo before the new season starts.
