Sir John Sawers, the former head of MI6, praised the security services' handing of threats from UK terror cells, saying the law must keep ahead of the threat

The former head of MI6 today warns there are ‘several thousand’ individuals of concern in Britain as he demands tougher anti-terror powers to prevent a ‘ghastly 7/7-style attack’.

Sir John Sawers also speaks out against the criticism of security services over their handling of Mohammed Emwazi – unmasked as Jihadi John – who is known to have been on their radar for at least six years.

He will tell Radio 4’s Today: ‘The threat that we face from terrorists here has gone up over the last three years and there has to be some response to that.

‘What we don’t want to do is wait for some ghastly 7/7-style terrorist attack here in the UK before political opinion changes.

‘The whole point is to move incrementally to ensure that the powers and resources available to the security services, intelligence services, are ahead of that threat.’

Sir John, who stepped down from MI6 last November, added: ‘I think in general when you look at the challenge that the security services are facing with the number of extremists here in the UK, elsewhere in Europe, they do a really professional job and, of course, they know many of these individuals, most of them who end up taking part in terrorist organisations.

‘They’d be more subject to criticism if someone came and committed an atrocity in this country or elsewhere who they had no knowledge of whatsoever.

‘They’re doing their professional job by being aware of these people. But there are probably several thousand of these individuals of concern and the numbers are rising as more people go to Syria and Iraq and are radicalised out there.

‘And no one is talking about rounding up all these people or keeping 100 per cent coverage, there’s just not the resources to do that and it would be contrary to our principles of human rights to do that…so you do have to find a balance in there.’

Sir John also dismissed claims the treatment of Emwazi by MI5 that may have helped radicalise him as ‘very specious arguments’.

However, the counter-terrorism laws watchdog David Anderson QC said the intelligence agencies may have made a ‘slip-up’ in failing to impose tighter controls on Emwazi due to the sheer number of suspects they have to cope with.

Mr Anderson said he was not surprised that Emwazi was not subject to measures such as house arrest, despite being on MI5’s radar, because the UK’s spies and counter-terrorism police were very busy. His warning came as Boris Johnson attacked ministers yesterday for scrapping control orders on terror suspects that could have prevented the murderer from slipping out of Britain to join Islamic State.

In what was seen as stinging criticism of Home Secretary Theresa May’s decision to replace the orders – under which suspects are tagged and confined to specific areas – with less restrictive measures, the London mayor said: ‘What this shows is we need to keep a very, very close eye on these people.

‘The decision to modify the control orders, to water them down, I think looks as though it was a mistake because it is vital to be able, when you are controlling these people, to be able to relocate them, to take them away from their support networks and… to monitor them.’

Mr Johnson spoke out after it was revealed that Emwazi, 26, had been on the radar of the security services for six years as part of a support network for West London-based terror suspects and extremists, some on control orders.

But these were replaced in 2011 by the Home Office – under intense pressure from the Lib Dems – with less restrictive Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (Tpims) making it harder to monitor movements of terror suspects.

‘The balance, the benefit of the doubt was, I am afraid, given too much to those who wish us serious harm,’ Mr Johnson said.

Lord Carlile, the Government’s former independent reviewer of anti-terrorism legislation, said Emwazi would have been placed under a control order.

Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: ‘We warned the Government not to abolish control orders. TPIMs are too weak.’

Michael Fallon said he is 'worried' about the spread of ISIS, and the threat pop-up cells pose to the UK

Police forces may have to work more closely with the Army under plans to thwart ‘pop-up’ terror cells. 

Defence chiefs are investigating how troops could give back-up to armed officers and how military helicopters could be used to move police around the country in the event of a Paris-style atrocity.

Special forces are already being prepared for urgent intervention against Islamic State fanatics, the Defence Secretary said yesterday.

Michael Fallon added: ‘We are facing Islamic State in Syria and it is on the borders of Europe. It is becoming a very direct threat to Europe. 

'We need to do something about it. I’m worried about the fight against IS, I’m worried about this spread of IS, this kind of pop-up IS, which can link up very easily.

‘The Home Secretary has been looking at how you can deploy sufficient numbers of armed officers in areas outside London.

‘And if they had an incident or two incidents or people fleeing from Manchester or London out to the countryside, do they really have enough armed officers to deal with that?’

He said that it was in those circumstances that the Army could be drafted in for large-scale operations, such as searching a forest or cordoning off a railway station.
