A diver has spoken of the terrifying moment he was nearly swallowed by a 40-tonne whale.

Rainer Schimpf, 47, was filming the annual sardine run off the coast of South Africa when a 15-metre-long Bryde's whale attacked a ball of fish below him.

Luckily the giant mammal swerved at the last moment to avoid sucking him into its gaping mouth - but it still gave him a shock as it breached just yards away.

Diver Rainer Schimpf, 47, has spoken of the moment he was nearly swallowed by a 40-tonne whale.  He was filming the annual sardine run when a 15m Bryde's whale attacked a ball of fish below him

He said: 'I saw him coming up and I thought 'that's it for me'. The diameter of his mouth was big enough to swallow a car - he would have barely felt me going in.'

The incident occurred off the coast of Port Elizabeth, South Africa.

The tour operator was out with guests and his wife, Silke, who managed to take a photograph as the whale breached just yards from her husband.

The sardine run sees billions of the tiny fish migrating up the east coast of Africa - attracting sharks, dolphins, diving birds and whales - including the huge Bryde's whales.

Every year between May and July millions of sardines gather on a spectacular marine migration.

They head eastwards from their cool spawning waters near Cape Town in search of zooplankton.

Likened to east Africa's buffalo migration, the sardine run sees them spawn and migrate from the cool waters of the Agulhas Bank, northward to the warmer waters along the east coast.

Shoals are known to be four miles long and one mile wide, and are clearly visible from the surface of the ocean.

Followed by thousands of hungry dolphins, sharks, sea birds and seals, the sardines protect themselves from this onslaught by forming into giant balls called 'bait balls' which can measure as large as 65 feet, or 20 metres, in diameter.

He said: 'There was a little bait ball below me and a group of sharks. It was only when the sharks scattered that I realised a whale was coming up directly at me.

'At the last moment he must have realised I was there and he diverted away from me and actually missed most of the bait ball.

'Had he not diverted he would have swallowed me whole.'

He
 added: 'Years ago there was a story about a guy who was swallowed by a 
sperm whale. His friends managed to snare the whale and cut it open and 
found he was still alive inside.

'However, he was bleached white and 
blinded by the animal's stomach acid.'

Bryde's
 whales feed on plankton, crustaceans and schools of fish, which they 
engulf in their huge mouths, and can be found in temperate and tropical 
oceans around the world.

Mr
 Schimpf, who hails from Germany, believes this is first time someone 
has captured one of them attacking a bait ball at this angle.
