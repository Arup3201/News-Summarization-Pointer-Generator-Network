Smiling broadly, Caroline Aherne yesterday made her first public appearance since revealing she has lung cancer.

The Mrs Merton star, 50, wore a black turban-style hat, beneath which the blonde hair of her wig could be seen.

Although she appeared gaunt, she seemed in good spirits as she arrived at a charity event with her mother Maureen, 77, on her arm.

Clued-up: Caroline Aherne stepped out for the first time yesterday after telling fans she was battling cancer for the third time

Comic character: Miss Aherne, 50, rose to fame with her spoof talk show The Mrs Merton Show

Miss Aherne used the opportunity to 
praise the support she has had from her Macmillan nurse, Julie Watts, 
whom she called ‘an angel’.

‘I just hold my hands up and say, thank God for Macmillan nurses,’ she said.

The
 actress, who like her brother Patrick was born with cancer of the 
retina, added: ‘Fifty years ago when my mum found out that we had cancer
 they didn’t have any Macmillan nurses, you were kind of on your own 
with it, so it’s a blessing we have got them now.

‘When
 you hear them [doctors] telling you you have cancer, it’s true that you
 really don’t take it in properly, you just don’t think of the 
questions.

‘And then when 
you come out, because she’s been in there with you, she answers all your
 questions that you haven’t been able to ask at the time or haven’t 
thought of.

‘This is the best bit, that they completely understand what you are going through and what your family are going through.’

Miss
 Aherne, who rose to fame with her spoof talk show The Mrs Merton Show, 
starred in and created The Royle Family and appeared in The Fast Show, 
was diagnosed with lung cancer earlier this year.

Once a prolific smoker, she has since given it up but has said the disease is not linked to her former habit.

The
 actress has confronted cancer twice before: As a baby when she had a 
rare cancer of the retina, retinoblastoma, which left her almost blind 
in one eye, and more recently when she had bladder cancer.

Support: The 50-year-old - who is currently battling lung cancer - was accompanied by her mother Maureen for the trip

Making a difference: The Mrs Merton star opted for a flared pair of leggings and a bright pink top, while adding a pale denim jacket for warmth

Speaking
 at the Macmillan Cancer initiative, Miss Aherne said: ‘My brother and I
 were born with cancer of the eyes, the retina. My Mum told us only 
special people get cancer. I must be very special because I have had it 
in my lungs and bladder as well.’

Humour
 and sharing a joke with nurses has helped her deal with her illness. 
She said: ‘So many funny things happen when you’re in there and, looking
 back, you do have a right laugh with the nurses. Although I was on 
morphine, so maybe it was just me laughing.

‘But that’s a way you can cope with it. If you can separate yourself from it, a sense of humour really, really helps.’

As she ended her speech she said light-heartedly: ‘My wig stayed on.’

Her
 most recent health troubles surfaced last December when she was 
unexpectedly absent from a recording of new Fast Show material. In May 
she announced she had lung cancer.

Previously
 she has had severe depression, which led to a suicide attempt, and has 
stayed at the Priory clinic in London following a series of alcoholic 
blackouts.

Miss Aherne, who 
narrates Channel 4 programme Gogglebox and BBC series Pound Shop Wars, 
was appearing yesterday at the launch of the Macmillan Cancer 
Improvement Partnership in Manchester.

The
 £3.4million project aims to improve cancer care in the city, where the 
number of people getting lung cancer is a third higher than in the rest 
of England. Survival rates are also 25 per cent lower.

Every day 120 people are diagnosed with lung cancer in Britain. It is the second most common form of cancer after breast cancer.
