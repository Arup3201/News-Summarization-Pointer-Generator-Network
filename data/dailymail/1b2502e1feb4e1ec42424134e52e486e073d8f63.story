The dizzying view from the latest New York City apartment to go on the market isn't the only thing that might make you feel a little queasy - the tall price might, too.

A six-bedroom penthouse condominium, which is likely to be the city's heighest occupied space, is up for sale for an eye-watering $85 million.

The apartment is at the top of a 1,397-foot aluminum and glass tower currently under construction at 432 Park Ave., between 56th and 57th streets in Manhattan, which is set to be completed in 2015.

At 1,302 ft above the street, the penthouse will be taller than the observation deck at One World Trade Center, 
which is 1,251 feet, even though the building is 1,776 feet with
a 408-foot antenna.

The 8,255-square-foot penthouse on Park Avenue will have floor-to-ceiling windows lining the rooms, which will measure an unusually high 12.5 feet, the Wall Street Journal reported.

The owners will also be able to enjoy a courtyard, circular drive and garden at the condominium, as well as a restaurant for residents and a private club with a pool.

Once completed, it will be the city's second tallest building and the penthouse will be the highest occupied space - that is, with people living or regularly working inside.

The building will not only set record-breaking heights, it will also create a new record cost for a Manhattan condominium; the total asking price for the building's 122 condominiums is $2.43 billion.

A show room for 432 Park Ave., which has been designed by Rafael Vinoly Architects, will open before the end of the year, brokers told the Journal.

It will be in competition with other buildings, such as One57, a glass-walled, 1,000-foot-tall design on West 57th street.

Condominiums at One57 have reportedly sold well, including two penthouses on the market for more than $90 million each. The price tag for the 95 condos total $2.27 billion.

But Extell Development, which is building One57, said the markets are entirely different as One57 will sell out much sooner than the upcoming building.

Pamela Liebman, president of the Corcoran Group, a consultant for Extell Development, added the two towering buildings will not be for everyone.

Competition: The Park Ave building has gone on the market shortly after that of One57, which looks over Central Park. It is 1,000 ft tall and apartments cost as much as $100 million each

'There are many buyers who do not want to be so high up in a building that they feel they are out of touch with the city and cityscape,' she said. 'It is more like being in a helicopter.'

But she added that having apartments in the two tall towers up for grabs at the same time could actually be beneficial for both, especially at a time when there has been nothing similar for a time.

While One57 has the bonuses of perfect vistas over Central Park and nearby services including spa treatments at the Park Hyatt Hotell, 432 Park Ave will have a courtyard, a circular drive and a garden.

It will also have a restaurant for residents and a private club with a pool available only to residents and friends.
