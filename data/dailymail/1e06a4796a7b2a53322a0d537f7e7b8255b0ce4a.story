Giorgio Chiellini has put World Cup disappointment with Italy and the biting scandal with Luis Suarez behind him by marrying partner Carolina Bonistalli.

The Juventus and Italy defender was right in the thick of the biting storm last month after Uruguay forward Suarez bit him during the final Group D game at the World Cup.

Suarez has since been handed a four month domestic ban and nine-match international suspension, while subsequently apologising to Chiellini through a statement via his official Twitter account.

Chiellini will be hoping the good times continue as the Italian giants look to retain their Serie A crown and also challenge strongly for the Champions League crown this season.
