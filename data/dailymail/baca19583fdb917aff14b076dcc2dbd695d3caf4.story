U.S. Navy veteran Madelynn Taylor and her late wife, Jean Mixner, were hoping to spend eternity together, but because of an Idaho state law defining marriage as only a union between a man and a woman, they will have to be buried apart.

Taylor served six years in the Navy between 1958 and 1964 before she was dishonorably discharged after a recruit went to her superior and revealed that she and another servicewoman were gay.

Taylor’s status was later amended to honorable on appeal, and now she is entitled to be laid to rest in the Idaho State Veterans Cemetery.

Ban: Under state law, Taylor's wife cannot be laid to rest in the Idaho State Veterans Cemetery because the state does not recognize same-sex marriages

Under state law, if the veteran was married to a man, her spouse could have been buried with her at the military cemetery.

But because Taylor had a wife who passed away in 2012, her application to have the two of them interred together has been rejected.

Federal law allows same-sex couples where one of the spouses is a veteran to be laid to rest together in national cemeteries like Arlington in Virginia, but the same cannot be said of state burial grounds, which are subjected to state laws. 

The Idaho State Constitution states: ‘A marriage between a man and a woman is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized in this state.’

Idaho Division of Veterans Services Deputy Administrator Tamara Mackenthun told KTVB that in Taylor's case, they have to follow Idaho's definition of spouse.

Angered by her predicament, Madelynn Taylor has taken up the cause of same-sex military couples with the goal of changing the Idaho State Constitution.

‘Normally I stammer and stutter myself. I'm not a public speaker,’ Taylor said. ‘I'm a background person. I work in the background. What's changed is I got mad at the cemetery, and decided it's time to do something about it.’

As a Navy veteran, Taylor can be buried with her deceased wife in another veterans cemetery, but the 74-year-old long-time Idaho resident does not want to settle. 

‘I just feel that it's the right place for me. You know, I'm a veteran. So they should let me... in fact they would let me alone, be in that crypt,’ Taylor said. 'But I don't want to alone. I want Jean with me.’

For Taylor and Mixner, it was love at first sight when the two women met in 1995. Later that same year, the happy couple held a symbolic wedding ceremony in Oregon.

In 2008, the life partners legally tied the knot in California not long before the passage of Proposition 8 banning same-sex marriages.  

Then two years ago, Mixner passed away from complications related to emphysema, and her widow decided that it was time to make final arrangements for herself as her health has gone into decline. 

‘I'm a stroke waiting to happen,’ Taylor told KBOI 2News Wednesday.

Since 2012, Taylor has kept her wife's ashes at home, waiting to be laid to rest with her own remains when her time came.

Taylor said she was not surprised when her request to be buried with Mixner was rejected by the state veterans cemetery.

‘I've been discriminated against for 70 years, and they might as well discriminate against me in death as well as life,’ she said.

The 74-year-old veteran said that the cemetery plot has plenty of space to house both her and her wife's ashes, so they would not have to take up any additional space.

‘I don't see where the ashes of a couple old lesbians is going to hurt anyone,’ Taylor said.

The ailing septuagenarian has since joined the Add the Four Words protest to change the state constitution, which so far has landed her in jail on two separate occasions.

If Madelynn Taylor passes away before the law is amended, she has made arrangements for someone to hold onto her and Mixner's ashes until they are permitted to be interred together.

‘Eventually I'm going to be there. It'll happen. They might as well give up and let us go now,’ Taylor stated.
