There seemed to be a medal on every uniform – be it military or school.

Three Victoria Crosses, four George Crosses, 1,650 gallantry decorations and tens of thousands of campaign medals were awarded during Britain’s 13-year action in Afghanistan.

Yesterday, as the country gathered to honour that campaign at St Paul’s Cathedral, several children were wearing the medals of fathers who never returned from the war against the Taliban.

It was the Queen who led the nation’s tribute, supported by the 93-year-old Duke of Edinburgh (literally so when it came to negotiating the steps of St Paul’s).

In pride of place behind her were the holders of another decoration. The Elizabeth Cross is the medal no one wants. Yet no decoration, surely, is worn with greater pride.

Devised by the sovereign at the height of the Afghan conflict in 2009, it is a silver brooch presented to the next of kin of every member of the Armed Forces killed in the line of duty – and there were 453 of those in Afghanistan. Yesterday, the families of every single one had been invited to join the Queen at St Paul’s.

Historians and politicians will still be debating the merits of the Afghan project years from now. But the bravery and determination of those called upon to serve there has never been in question. Hence the decision to recognise their collective efforts with a formal act of worship and a parade through the City of London.

Entitled ‘A Service of Commemoration, Reflection and Remembrance’ (‘thanksgiving’ might have been triumphal), this was a state occasion of the highest order.

All the senior members of the Royal Family – including Afghan veteran Prince Harry – and all the Service chiefs were present, along with the three main party leaders plus representatives of our Nato allies and all the main faiths.

Past prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were also present. They had front row seats in the South Transept, flanked by senior Forces personnel rather than grieving families.

In the run-up to this service some had questioned the presence of the leaders who took Britain into this conflict. There would, of course, have been louder criticism had the two men stayed away. Even so, great delicacy was required. At the close, the ex-PMs were out of a side door and off the premises before the royal chauffeurs had even started their engines.

By far the largest section of the 2,600-strong congregation – more numerous, even, than the veterans themselves – were the bereaved. For each holder of the Elizabeth Cross had been granted two invitations – and quite right, too.

There were some desperately poignant sights; a schoolboy with Dad’s medals sitting alongside Mum, in black, with her Elizabeth Cross on her lapel and tissues clasped tightly in her hand; a middle-aged couple blinking back tears; a young mother, dressed in black, dashing for the door with a small, screaming boy in her arms during the opening prayers. It’s rare to see a toddler at a state occasion. Presumably, the little chap was there to honour a gallant father or uncle.

I hope they were both allowed back in. Because this was a magnificent service, a finely judged blend of tradition, innovation, stirring but non-martial music and audience participation.

Among half a dozen worshippers chosen to read the prayers of intercession were a senior RAF officer, former Corporal Sarah Bushbye MC, who won her Military Cross dashing through a maelstrom of gunfire to treat four wounded soldiers, and Kerry Ashworth, mother of Lance Corporal James Ashworth of the Grenadier Guards.

He won a posthumous VC for his attack on Taliban positions in 2012.

‘For peacemakers and peacekeepers who seek to keep this world secure and free, may God give peace,’ declared Mrs Ashworth faultlessly, her son’s VC pinned alongside her EC.

Seats were left empty at the service as family members of the 453 who died chose not to attend.

Relatives travelled to London to watch the service on a screen outside St Paul’s Cathedral – even though more than 40 seats were left unoccupied inside.

Graham Knight, whose son Sergeant Ben Knight, 25, was killed in an explosion in 2006, was one who declined the invitation.

Mr Knight, from John O’ Groats, said: ‘It is more of a public relations exercise, with the good and the great at the front and all the relatives at the back. We don’t need to go to a service like that to remember our son, we remember him every day.’

Around 20 bereaved family members and veterans were either unwell or unable to travel at the last minute and did not attend the service.

Another 15 to 20 bereaved family members and veterans unexpectedly did not turn up.

A Ministry of Defence source said: ‘It’s understandable that on such an emotional day for so many people there were some who felt they couldn’t attend today’s service.’

After a lesson from Prime Minister David Cameron (‘Blessed are the peacemakers…’), the Bishop of London shared his readings with 13-year-old Tyler Barrow from Hampshire.

Tyler still remembers the day in 2007 when his father, Captain Gary Barrow of the King’s Royal Hussars, was so badly wounded he had to be evacuated back to Britain. But Captain Barrow made a full recovery and went on to complete a further two tours of duty.

It was hard to tell who was proudest of whom when I met them yesterday. ‘I’m more nervous than he is,’ Captain Barrow admitted before the service. In another emotionally charged moment, the Bastion Cross was carried the full length of the cathedral in a procession of its own. Originally knocked together from old shell cases at Camp Bastion, this brass crucifix became a shrine for troops in the field.

Yesterday, before the Head of the Armed Forces herself, it was formally rededicated by the Archbishop of Canterbury, The Most Rev Justin Welby. The Archbishop based his short sermon on the words of the prophet, Jeremiah: ‘Great is your faithfulness.’

Thanking all the troops, he also lauded the vast support network behind them. ‘I’m told that each wounded person was supported by up to 80 others by the time they got home.’ And he had stirring words for the home front.

‘We also thank those of you who stayed behind, who let your loved ones go; you who worried for their safety each day, took your phone to your bedside each night. Great is your faithfulness.’

Departing to Bach’s Prelude and Fugue in B Minor, the Queen was introduced to another cross-section of those whose lives were turned upside down by this conflict.

Corporal Matthew Webb of the Royal Marines is now a triple amputee. Sally Thorneloe lost her husband, Lieutenant-Colonel Rupert Thorneloe of the Welsh Guards, the most senior officer killed in the conflict.

Yesterday, she was accompanied by her daughters, Hannah, nine, and Sophie, seven, who presented flowers to the Queen.

In front of the cathedral, the parade was forming up. Detachments from all the Services marched the short distance to a Guildhall reception while an RAF flypast – including that great Afghan warhorse, the Chinook – flew overhead.

Thousands of onlookers, many of them City workers, had turned out to clap them all.

I am glad to report that I neither saw nor heard a single protester, just lots of polite, heartfelt applause. Some of the loudest was for those bringing up the rear – the families.

For many, the last experience of something like this was the raw agony of the homecoming parade at Wootton Bassett in Wiltshire. Yesterday should leave them with a sunnier memory. ‘No tears today. That was beautiful and we are smiling,’ said Elizabeth Daniels of Hyde, Lancashire, beneath a glorious lime green hat. She was here to remember her beloved brother, Corporal Harvey Holmes, and to support her mother Beverley Mayall.

Parents-to-be: Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge also attended the moving service

At Guildhall I met Brenda Wilson and her daughter Rachel Stanley, 27. Her Elizabeth Cross pinned proudly to her coat, Brenda had bumped into some old comrades of her son, Corporal Jack Stanley of the Queen’s Royal Hussars, who died on Easter Sunday 2012.

‘I cannot fault anything about today. It’s been wonderful,’ she said. ‘Coming here, you realise you’re not on your own. You’re part of an enormous family.’

It may be a family that has known great pain. But yesterday will undoubtedly have left it stronger.

Tony and Gordon Brown attended the service but left out of a back entrance of St Paul’s to avoid coming face to face with the families of those who died in Afghanistan.

Mr Blair, the prime minister who took Britain to war, and his successor left several minutes before the other guests, escorted by bodyguards to separate BMW saloons.

Relatives had reacted with fury last week when told Mr Blair and Mr Brown would be among the congregation, with one saying Mr Blair has ‘got blood on his hands’. A spokesman for Mr Blair said he had to leave quickly to fly to an economic conference in Egypt.
