A 4-year-old boy who witnessed his mother's brutal murder has pointed the finger at the 22-year-old woman's boyfriend, who initially claimed burglars shot her dead. 

Police were called to the Orlando, Florida home of John Michael DeJesus and his fianceé Yolizmarie DeJesus Borrero  the morning of April 30, where they found the woman bleeding from her right temple. Authorities arrived on the scene at 4:43am and six minutes later, Ms Borrero was pronounced dead laying in her bed on bloodied sheets next to her 4-month-old daughter.

DeJesus told police that he was a drug dealer, and that three men broke into the house he rents from his mother to target him. He blamed the burglars for shooting dead the woman he proposed to just three days before.

But the victim's 4-year-old son from a previous relationship, who was sleeping in a bedroom across the hall, appears to have witnessed the murder and inadvertently implicated DeJesus  after  watching the film The Amazing Spider-Man 2.

At the end of the film, a main character is killed and the  boy told a family member: 'That's how daddy killed mommy.'

Other evidence suggests DeJesus committed the crime as well. 

A neighbor's surveillance footage shows a man running from the direction of DeJesus's house to a nearby lake, and then running back around the time of the shooting.

Investigators later found the murder weapon submerged in that body of water.

DeJesus was arrested on May 9 and charged with first-degree murder. He remains locked up in Orange County, Florida jail 

And just two months before Borrero's death, DeJesus called her father William DeJesus to complain about her. 

'You need to get your daughter from here. I don't want to live anymore with your daughter because one day I'm gonna kill her,' DeJesus allegedly said, according to Borrero's father.

Family have described the couple's relationship as tumultuous and volatile. 

Borrero's sister Yariliz DeJesus Borrero  says DeJesus once punched out all the windows in her car after she told family that he slapped her. 

'He was very jealous of Yolizmarie,' Borrero's cousin Luz Minerva Izquierdo Santiago told deputies in Spanish, as reported in the Orlando Sentinel. 'He would not let her go out and kept her from her family. John DeJesus would humiliate Yolizmarie by saying she was fat and ugly...

'He told her that he was bored with her and was constantly throwing her out of the house.'

DeJesus, who has ties to the Latin Kings gang, was arrested on first-degree murder charges on May 9.  

His criminal record also includes a conviction for lewd and lascivious battery of a 13-year-old girl in 2005.  

Borrero's 4-year-old son is now in the custody of his biological father. Borrero and DeJesus' 4-month-old daughter is being raised by her mother Liz Miranda.
