Acclaimed headteacher: Anne Lakey denies having sex with a 13-year-old boy in the 1980s

An acclaimed headteacher accused of having sex with a 13-year-old boy in the 1980s told a jury she was 'shocked and horrified' when her accuser emailed her school with his claims.

Anne Lakey, 54, told Durham Crown Court she believed the message from the complainant was a hoax, and said that the alleged abuse had not happened.

The married mother-of-one from Stanley, County Durham, denies four counts of indecency with a child under 14 and five counts of indecent assault against a child under 16. The charges all relate to the same boy, who was one of a group who would visit her home.

The complainant, who was not a pupil of hers, claims Lakey, then a teacher in her 20s, seduced him in his school uniform after allowing him to watch her bathe.

Giving evidence earlier in the trial, he told the jury that matters progressed from a game of dare on a previous occasion when he fondled her.

He said on other occasions, as their relationship continued over a period of months, they had oral sex.

The offences are said to have happened in the late 1980s.

Lakey, chief executive of the Durham Federation of Schools which the jury has heard were formerly failing comprehensives in ex-mining villages and now among the most improved in the country, denies she was ever alone with him at her home.

In December 2012, he spotted her picture on the internet and read a blog about her educational beliefs, in which it was stated that  Lakey was committed to giving young people the best chance in life.

In anger, he then sent a message to the school accusing her of having sex with him as a teenager, the court was told.

The complainant came forward in 2012 after seeing a piece of literature which said that

Julie Clemitson, defending, asked Lakey how she reacted to the email.

'When I was first made aware, it was just utter disbelief,' she replied.

'It was not true, therefore (I was) shocked and horrified.

'My chair of governors was on site. I called him in.' She said the email had been a hoax, adding 'it had not happened.'

The complainant claimed Lakey sometimes telephoned his school pretending to be his mother, and said he was ill when he played truant to be with her.

Lakey denied this, and said she was unaware he was skipping school, explaining: 'I would have said it’s not an all right thing to do.'

Caroline Goodwin, prosecuting, asked: 'Why on earth would he be saying you had done these things to him?'

Lakey replied: 'I don’t know why he is doing these things, if I said it would be speculation.

'I have no idea why (he) has put this allegation forward.

'When I got the email at school I was shocked, it wasn’t true.

'My instinct at the time it was (motivated by) money, but that’s speculation.'

Lakey became the head teacher at Deerness Valley Comprehensive in 2001 which later became one of two schools to form the Durham Federation of Schools.

Under Lakey’s leadership the school boasted GCSE pass rates of 80 per cent in 2013 against 26 per cent the year before, and it was named the country’s most improved secondary school last year.

She was described as an ‘inspiring leader’ by the Chief Inspector of Education after improving GCSE pass rates at her struggling school by focusing on vocational education. 

But she was suspended from her position as chief executive of the Durham Federation of Schools last December after the allegations came to light.

Lakey, who was appointed to the national leaders of education, a body charged with transforming struggling schools, entered teaching in 1982.

The trial continues.
