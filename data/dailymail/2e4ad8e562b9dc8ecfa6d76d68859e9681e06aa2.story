Protests spread across Pakistan today in response to the shooting of 14-year-old Malala Yousafzai by a Taliban assassin which left her fighting for life.

Surgeons today said they have successfully removed a bullet from the teenager, who was shot in front of her classmates on board her school bus yesterday.

Malala was waiting to leave the grounds of her school in Mingora, in Pakistan’s Swat Valley, when a bearded man entered the bus and shot her and another girl.

Outrage: Activists carry photographs of Malala Yousafzai during a protest rally against her assassination attempt

The 14-year-old is widely known and 
respected for her work to promote the schooling of girls and denouncing the atrocities committed by the Taliban.

Fury over the attack has spread across 
the country, with demonstrators protesting in Lahore, Peshawar, 
Islamabad and Mingora earlier today.

Attacked: Malala Yousafzai was shot on her way home from school

Many schools in Swat Valley closed their doors in protest over the shooting, and the country's army chief vowed to fight on against militants as anger erupted across the nation.

The Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) have taken responsibility for the assassination attempt and told a Pakistani newspaper they will target her again if she survives.

Malala suffered wounds to her 
head and neck in the attack yesterday afternoon. The other shot girl is in a stable condition.

A man approached the school bus and 
asked which one of the girls was Malala, Rasool Shah, Mingora police 
chief said.

Malala was pointed out by a girl near her, but after the young activist lied about her identity the gunman shot both of them.

A spokesman for the TTP told Pakistani
 newspaper The Express Tribune that Malala was shot because she was a 
’secular-minded lady’ and that this should serve as a warning for other 
young people like her.

The country's top military officer, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, issued a strongly-worded statement condemning the attack.

Support: Demonstrators in Mingora hold banners reading 'we want peace on our motherland' and 'attack on Malala Yousafzai is an unsuccessful attempt to destroy peace in the valley'

Anger: Banners condemning the attack are held up in Peshawar yesterday

The powerful army chief rarely makes such public pronouncements, even when it comes to military matters.

Referring
 to the 2009 military operation that saved Swat Valley from Taliban 
control, he said: 'In attacking Malala, the terrorists 
have failed to grasp that she is not only an individual, but an icon of 
courage and hope who vindicates the great sacrifices that the people of 
Swat and the nation gave, for wresting the valley from the scourge of 
terrorism.'

As well as 
the closure of schools, flags in front of the Mingora government 
headquarters were at half-mast, and police officers stood guard outside 
Malala's family's house in case they were also targeted by Taliban 
assassins.

Speaking from an undisclosed location, Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan said that Malala would not be safe if she survives.

Wounded: Hospital staff assist Malala Yousafzai as she arrives at Saidu Sharif Teaching Hospital after the attack in the Swat Valley region in northwest Pakistan

Help: Crowds gathered around the hospital as news quickly spread about the attempted assassination of the young peace activist

Malala was still said to be 
unconscious after her surgery and she may need to be taken to a foreign 
hospital for further specialist treatment. But doctors were happy she 
was out of danger.

She won the Pakistani National Youth Peace Prize last year. She and her family have previously 
been threatened by the Taliban for her campaigns and authorities must now decide how they can protect her from future attack.

The failed assassination displayed 
the viciousness of Islamic militants in Swat Valley, an area which has struggled
 with militant insurgent influence despite military operations.

At
 one time the picturesque region - nicknamed the Switzerland of Pakistan
 - was a popular tourist destination for Pakistanis. Honeymooners 
vacationed along the river.

Attempt: A Pakistani Taliban organisation have taken responsibility for the shooting which also injured another girl on the bus leaving their school in Mingora

Then the Taliban in 2007 began infiltrating the valley, eventually assuming near-total control of the region before being ejected in a massive Pakistani military operation in 2009.

A
 recent court case highlights the issues facing young women in Pakistan 
after the high court ordered a probe into an alleged barter of seven 
girls to settle a blood feud in the Dera Bugti district of Baluchistan 
province.

A tribal council 
of the prominent Bugi tribe ordered the barter in early September, the 
district deputy commissioner, Saeed Faisal, told the court. The ages of 
the girls have not been confirmed but local media reported they were 
between 4 and 13 years old.

The
 tradition of families exchanging unmarried girls to settle feuds is 
banned under Pakistani law but still practiced in the country's more 
conservative, tribal areas.
