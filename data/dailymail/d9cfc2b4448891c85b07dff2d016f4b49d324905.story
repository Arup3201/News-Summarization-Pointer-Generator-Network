The White House may have gone a little extreme with their holiday
decorations this year, decking their halls with a staggering 54 live Christmas
trees - enough to put one in nearly every other room in the entire building.

This year's total is nearly 50 per cent more than last year's 37, which included seven
artificial ones. In truth, the number of
trees varies from year-to-year. In 1997 there were 36 trees, while in 2008,
there were a scant 27.

First Lady Michelle Obama seemed excited over the abundant greenery,
saying in her holiday address, 'We have 54 trees in the White House -- 54. That’s a lot of trees.'

Holiday Spirit: The Obamas have scattered 54 Christmas trees around the White House.

Tree Happy: The 54 trees dwarfs last year's total of just 36 trees. In 2008, the White House was decorated with only 27 trees.

Good Will: Each tree is decorated to bring focus to this year's theme of 'Joy for All.'

All of the trees are ornately decorated and placed in various rooms
of the White House with the goal of promoting this year’s theme of ‘Joy for All.’
Some, however, take on more special meanings.

Four trees in the grand foyer are trimmed with ornaments that pay
tribute to the holiday legacies of former First Ladies, dating back to Jacqueline
Kennedy. While some of the decorations are replicas, others are from generations past and show what the
holidays were like in previous administrations.

Other trees, including the massive 19-foot-tree in the Blue Room, are designed to pay tribute to the troops. One tree is decorated with gold stars decorated by people around the country and that bear the names of a fallen U.S. solider.

Meanwhile the Blue Room tree, which was this year's grand champion winner of the National Christmas Tree Association, is covered with hand-decorated ornaments from military children living in bases around the world.

Looking good enough to eat: A 300lb gingerbread replica of the White House is the centrepiece of the White House Christmas decorations, unveiled today by Michelle Obama

One of your five-a-day? The structure even features a marzipan version of Michelle's kitchen garden

The abundance of intricately decorated trees doesn't come as much of surprise from a White House that also managed baked up a 300lb gingerbread replica of the 
White House that is the centerpiece of the White House Christmas 
decorations.

The impressive structure, which 
features a marzipan version of the kitchen garden and an oversized model
 of First Dog Bo, was pride of place in the the State Dining Room. There are also 40 'Bo-flake' ornaments throughout the White House that feature cutout images of the dog.

There's a life-size replica of the dog, with a string of lights in his mouth, in the East Garden Room.

And there's an outsized statue of the Portuguese water dog next to the 300-pound gingerbread house in the State Dining Room.

Icing on the cake: The incredible detail of the gingerbread house can be seen in a Twitter picture posted by the Daily Beast's Robin Givhan. Even the windows are glossy to resemble glass

Mrs Obama said that reflects Bo's high standing at the White House.

'He's almost as big as the house,' she declared. 'He is such a huge personality.'

Visitors also will get a Bo bookmark that sends them on a scavenger hunt for 'Bo-ornaments' stashed in eight rooms.

Bo himself made an appearance during Wednesday's festivities, sporting a
 jingle bell collar, and was quickly swarmed by young guests.

This year's decorations include lots of handmade items that could easily
 be done at home, including patriotic wreaths and ornaments wrapped in 
red, white and blue yarn to fit with Mrs. Obama's emphasis on supporting
 military families.

The gargantuan gingerbread house, however, is not a feat for amateurs to
 attempt: It contains more than 175 pounds of gingerbread and modified 
gingerbread and more than 50 pounds of chocolate.

Pastry chef Bill 
Yosses mixed up a combination of wheat, rye and white-flour gingerbread 
that mimics the color of the sandstone house prior to 1798, when the 
house was first painted white.

Main attraction: The official White House Christmas tree, an 18ft 6in Frasier fur from Jefferson, North Carolina, trimmed with ornaments decorated by children of military families

More than 90,000 visitors are expected to pass through the White House this holiday season.

Executive chef Cristeta Comerford said she's drawing on the recipes in 
Mrs. Obama's gardening book, American Grown, as she prepares food for 
all the guests.

The treats will include sweet potato quick bread, green 
beans with almonds and a winter salad featuring fennel.

Ta-da! The First Lady seemed delighted with her efforts

Taste test: The First Lady also made time to sample her handiwork

Season's greetings: Mrs Obama said that the theme for this year's decorations was Joy to All

The massive decorating job comes together in just five days, with the help of 85 
volunteers from around the country.

This year's volunteers included 
Nellie Funk, a military wife from Carlisle, Pa., who was working beside 
retired homicide detective Tracy Jacobson from Southern California.

Asked which job was more fun - detective or decorator - Jacobson deadpanned: 'This has been much more fun.'
