A feud between a husband and the parents of his missing wife has escalated after he threatened to release her diaries, claiming they prove that she was promiscuous and had run off with another man.

Josh Powell has maintained that he and the couple's two sons were camping in the middle of a blizzard on the night his wife Susan went missing from their West Valley, Utah, home in December 2009.

Mr Powell, 34, who is the only person of interest in the case, claims  that 28-year-old Susan left of her own accord and has described her as 'extremely unstable'.

Family: Susan Powell with her two young sons and husband Josh

The void left by a lack of credible leads in the case has been filled by several public feuds between the two families.

Josh Powell's father Steve 
read his daughter-in-law's diaries and came to the conclusion that an emotionally turbulent
upbringing led to her running away with another man.

He told ABC4 News: ‘Susan led a very 
troubled childhood where there was emotional abuse at her family's home.
It affected her and her older sister.’

Now he and his son are considered publishing extracts from the diaries online.

Steve Powell has said that the
journals, which stretch back to when Susan was a teenager, show that 
she attempted to commit suicide and was 'lustful', and therefore could 
have run off with another man.

The allegation brought a furious 
response from Susan’s father, Chuck Cox, who said he would fight the release of the pages.

He told the ABC news channel: 'We 
deny all allegations, they are just totally ridiculous and we’re very 
disappointed and believe it’s unconscionable that he would first read 
those journals and then think he had the right to publish them.'

He said: 'They don't have authority to do it. If she is alive, 
which they claim, she then still maintains control over her writings, copyright-wise.

'If they publish it, I'm prepared to take action. I have an attorney and we're waiting.'

The
diary extracts show seven handwritten pages on what appears to be 
school notebook paper, detailing events from Susan's life in 1996 
and 1998.

Steve Powell
said that the documents prove that 'Susan is a lot more vulnerable 
emotionally than Chuck and Judy Cox (her mother) would like people to 
believe'.

Further, the diary extracts show 'that Susan led a double-life from the time she was 13, 14, or possibly even 12,' Mr Powell claimed.

Police widened their search to a network of abandoned mines in Ely, Nevada, but have not revealed any new evidence

The debate comes days after authorities searched a sprawling network of abandoned mines outside Ely, Nevada, but did not reveal any new evidence.

The renewed interest into Susan Powell's disappearance comes after a remembrance rally for her descended into chaos on Friday as family members traded allegations in public.

Tensions reached a boiling point between the feuding families as 
loved ones gathered in Puyallup, Washington to pass out flyers and comb 
for leads.

Steve Powell confronted Mr Cox, calling him a 'liar' and a 'cyberbully'.

The families are scheduled to meet in court today when Josh Powell will request a restraining order against Mr Cox.

Chuck Cox has said that he will fight the release of his daughter's diaries

Mrs Powell was last seen at her home on December 6, 2009.

She was reported missing the next day when she failed to show up for her job in West Valley City, Utah.

Her husband recently told the Salt Lake Tribune that he is willing to talk with federal authorities, but not West Valley City police.

He told the newspaper that he considered the search in Ely an opportunity for authorities to set him up.

'It occurred to me,' he said, according to the paper, 'they were planting something in Ely so they could magically show it to the media.'

The FBI Utah office's spokeswoman, Debbie Dujanovic Bertram, declined to comment yesterday.
