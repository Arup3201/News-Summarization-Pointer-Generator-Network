What could be America's most isolated seaside home is up for sale and could soon belong to a lucky hermit able to come up with more than $41,000.

Maine's tiny Boon Island and its lighthouse, which sit off the coast of the town of York, are up for auction by the federal government until 5:30am Wednesday.

At 133-feet, the lighthouse is New England's tallest -- but at six desolate miles off an already sparsely populated coast, is it also its loneliest residence?

Lonely home? Boon Island Light Station sits in the Gulf of Maine about six miles off the coast of York, Maine and would make an isolated home perfectly suited for many a sea-loving hermit

Not popular: A recent auction for the lighthouse was extended after getting a top bid of just $41,000

If the number of bidders in the auction is any indication, it might be just too lonely for most to handle.

Initial bidding, which closed at 10am Tuesday, was lackluster.

Seven people bid on the lighthouse, with the top bid coming in at $41,000.

Updated: The light has been automated since 1978 - here photos show views from the top

Desolate: The isolate outcropping of granite is located six desolate miles from York, Maine and was once the site of a shipwreck where sailors eventually turned to cannibalism

The goverment opened bidding up again, which ends early Wednesday. Bidding could potentially be extended a second time.

In addition to its isolation, Boon Island's dark history could be to blame.

The barren outcrop of granite was the site of a shipwreck in 1710. The stranded sailors ultimately resorted to cannibalism.

Tradition: Boon Island is among the five or so light houses on the New England and Gulf Coasts auctioned by the Coast Guard each year

The 
purchase also would come with stipulations.

While the buyer would own 
the rocky island and lighthouse, he or she would be required to allow 
the light to remain 'a navigational aid maintained by the United States 
Coast Guard,' according to Seacoastonline.com.

Dilapidated: It appears that the new owner might have a bit of work on their hands
