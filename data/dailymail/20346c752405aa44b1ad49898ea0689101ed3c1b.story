Fake vicar: George Gordon arriving at Liverpool Crown Court today to face charges of fraud and deception after being on the run for three years

A professional conman who tricked charities out of over £90,000 by masquerading as a vicar was jailed for five years today.

George Christopher Gordon, 52,  fraudulently applied for £90,000 worth of grants from the Merseyside Disability Foundation (MDF) by falsely representing existing community groups and inventing others.

Gordon also conned several other charities into paying him for projects such as outreach work, support groups and training social workers, Liverpool Crown Court heard.

The 'Reverend' George Gordon, who ordered his clerical title from an American website, admitted nine counts of 
obtaining money by deception and 11 counts of fraud.

Gordon went on the run for three years 
after his lies were uncovered in 2008, but he was tracked down in Durham
after a nationwide appeal.

The professional con artist, who in 
1999 was jailed for four years for a £21,000 fraud, was so highly respected as a vicar that he became a member of an MDF funding panel, eventually taking decisions on his own fraudulent applications.

He gained the trust of volunteers at the MDF by falsely claiming he had cancer
and manic depression.

He then successfully applied repeatedly for their maximum grant of £5,000, which he deposited in his personal bank account.

He used part of the stolen money to buy himself a flat in Chancellor Court, Toxteth, Liverpool.

As part of his audacious scam, Gordon also siphoned European grant funding when he was working for the MDF between February 2005 and October 2007.

Gordon showed no emotion today as the judge sentenced him to five years in prison.

Passing sentence, Judge Stephen Everett said: 'You pleaded guilty to a callous set of offences of dishonesty, the audacity of which takes a person’s breath away.'

'You used that veneer of respectability to dupe a number of honest, decent and vulnerable persons to achieve your dishonest aims.'

Prosecuting lawyer, Rowena Goode told the court that a police officer had sent off for the same 'ordination' certificate as Gordon.

'To investigate this matter the arresting officer applied himself and so is now, also, a ‘reverend’,' she said, showing how easily the fraud had taken place.

Unrepentant: George Gordon, who was sentenced to 5 years jail, showed no emotion in court as the Judge called him 'cold-hearted' and 'cunning'

Listing his many elaborate offences, Goode told the court Gordon set up an organisation called the Somewhere Else Mental Health Project.

In October 2004 the project obtained £5,000 to 'train social workers'.

Then in December 2005, the same group was awarded a further £5,000 to 'teach individuals how to use computers and give an introduction to word processing'.

This was just one of a number of fronts for Gordon's deception.

He also involved himself in a legitimate organisation, the Manic Depression Fellowship, where he portrayed himself as a Reverend and a graduate of Cambridge and Lampeter Universities.

Using this organisation, Gordon set up the Liverpool University Self Help Group, and obtained £4,800 to purchase a laptop and fund cognitive behaviour therapy.

Gordon helped to set up the Blue Skies Project, which claimed to help people with depression and which was also awarded £5,000, and the Surviving Suicide Merseyside Group which received £10,000 from the MDF.

The exposure of his elaborate scam 
forced the Bi-Polar Organisation’s Merseyside branch to close down after
his criminal activities came to light.

Goode said: 'The sadness of this case is that most of the people who were duped were themselves suffering from genuine mental health problems.'

He also conned the bi-polar Karonga Garden Project, the Borderline Personality Disorder, Liverpool University Disability Fellowship and Adlam Accessible Allotments.

Detective Sergeant Richie Jones from 
Sefton CID said: 'George Gordon is a selfish and cunning man who 
defrauded charities created to help some of the most vulnerable people 
in our communities.'

The judge told Gordon, who sat throughout the hearing with a fixed smile, that he was 'cold-hearted' and 'cunning'.

He said: 'You have no idea what it is like to be part of a group or loving family because you don’t care about anybody but yourself.'
