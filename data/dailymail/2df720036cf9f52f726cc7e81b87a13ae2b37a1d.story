The ex-girlfriend of Justin Lee Collins has revealed how the abusive TV presenter turned her from a 'confident, 
fun-loving person' into an 'exhausted beaten-down husk of a woman'.

Anna Larke has given details of the abuse she suffered at his hands in a bid to encourage other women who are suffering domestic abuse to seek help.

The Friday Night Project presenter, 38, was convicted of harassment after a 10-day trial earlier this month.

In an interview with Now magazine, Miss Larke, also 38, spoke candidly about her experiences with the controlling Collins.

The pair met at an awards ceremony in 
2006 and instantly hit it off. They began trading flirty e-mails and 
texts and the TV presenter told her his marriage was in trouble.

She said
 they would text all day and all night, and the first signs of his 
controlling personality would manifest in these messages.

Anna said Collins shut her beloved cat Jak in a suitcase and sent it spinning across the room while laughing maniacally.

After that Jak was so terrified of Collins that he'd soil himself, angering the TV presenter further.

He'd grab the cat and throw him in the litter tray.

He would force her to reply within five minutes, no matter where she was or what she was doing, and demand intimate pictures.'

Other bizarre behaviour began to emerge: He'd demand to know which men she found attractive on TV and was angry if he didn't like the answer, he forced her to cancel a holiday to Ibiza and made her change her phone number twice to make it hard for friends to stay in touch.

Miss Larke said he lavished her with gifts and fancy hotels and was charming but his texts were becoming more and more aggressive.

He called her a 'fat dog' and 'ugly' and claims he repeatedly pushed her on a night out with co-presenter Alan Carr, sparking a huge row.

Later he flirted and danced with another woman in front of her.

But still she loved him, and was 
heartbroken at newspaper reports exposing him for cheating on his wife 
with another girl. Their contact stopped around that time but two years later,
 in late 2010, he e-mailed her suggesting they meet for a drink. She 
warily agreed and he told her his marriage was in severe trouble.

Verdict: Justin Lee Collins leaves St Albans Crown Court on October 9 after being found guilty of harassing her

She said: 'He told me his wife had suggested he have anger management courses, which made me wonder if he'd been abusive towards her too. He kept telling me, "You look gorgeous, I want to kiss you".

'We didn't kiss, but I realised I was still in love with him. Sadly, things were about to turn violent.'

In December they went to Miami and the physical abuse started. He painfully pinched the backs of her arms when she told him she wanted to leave a club to sleep off her jet lag.

Despite this they moved in together and the abuse escalated. First he made her delete her Facebook and Twitter accounts and share an e-mail account with him.

He badgered her for details of all her past sexual relationships and wrote it all down. 'Sometimes he'd get it out and ask random questions to see if my answer matched what was in the book,' she said.

She told the court she had to sleep facing him and he'd jab her in the back if she turned away while sleeping.

In the coming months he began to slap her in intimate places, spit in her face and hit her with a magazine. She left but he begged her to reconsider and she took him back.

Soon after he threw a satnav at her and pulled her hair so hard it yanked her neck.

Miss Larke described this as her 'lightbulb moment' and slipped away when he was on a photoshoot.

Her family arranged for her to speak to a policewoman and the legal proceedings began. His sentence was 140 hours' community service, which Miss Larke feels was not enough.

Immediately after the trial Justin Lee Collins was pictured laughing. She added: 'It was like he was laughing in my face, saying, "I got away with it".

'If you're in a similar situation to mine, there are two things you should know: you're not alone, even if it feels like it; and it's only going to get worse. Please don't spend your life in fear. No one has a right to control you.'
