When the police come knocking at a suspected drug den, you wouldn't necessarily expect them to leave a polite calling card.

But that is exactly what happened when officers left a light-hearted note informing the occupant of a property they had raided that they had 'no cannabis left' after 72 plants were discovered.

Officers from Greater Manchester Police kicked down the door of the house in Worsley, Salford, during the raid, but found nobody was in the property.

They then altered a printed note saying 'unfortunately you were not at home', to leave the polite message.

A photo of the note was then posted on the GMP Salford West Twitter feed along with the message: 'We’ve kicked in a door in Worsley, got 72 cannabis plants, nobody home. Left a note. GMP, keeping you in the loop.'

The tweet proved popular among Twitter users who had by this morning re-tweeted it 759 times.

The force, including GMP Salford West, has an active social media presence, but it has not always been as well-received as yesterday's post.

Last month, an officer behind the feed got into hot water by advising people being ‘harassed’ on Facebook to close their accounts.

It caused a storm among some tweeters, who said it appeared to blame victims for bullying and harassment.

The tweet was later deleted and an apology - which said that ‘bullying and harassment is, of course, serious’ - was posted.

Officers who control the feed were spoken to by GMP bosses about their use of social media following the mishap.

Another controversial tweet on the feed, posted in January, said: 'Do you live in Little Hulton or Walkden? Hate the Police? Want to brag & rub our noses in it? RT (retweet) if you have drugs & haven’t been caught.' It was retweeted around 500 times.
