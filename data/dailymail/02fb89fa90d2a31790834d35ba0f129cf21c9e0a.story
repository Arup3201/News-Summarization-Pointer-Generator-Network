As stylish couples go - no one has quite managed to live up to Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg. 

The couple were the epitome of seventies chic and although their 13-year love affair ultimately ended in disaster, 30 years after it finished fans of the couple still regard it as one of the great romances of the 20th Century. 

Now a new exhibition is allowing the public to get up close and personal with the stars, with photographs taken from Jane's brother Andrew's personal archive going on show in London from this week.

Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg were the epitome of seventies chic and a new exhibition featuring photographs from the personal archive of Jane's brother Andrew Birkin is going on show at London's Proud Gallery this month. Here Jane & Serge are pictured watching the sunset in Oxford, August 8, 1969

The couple met as co-stars on the set of the film Slogan in 1968, where they also recorded the theme tune 'La chanson de slogan,' together. 

Their first date comprised of a crawl of the nightclubs in Paris, ending up in a transvestite bar. 

When Serge was no longer able to hold his booze, he took Jane back to the Hilton hotel and promptly passed out.

The date was a resounding success though and they swiftly fell in love - Serge was 20 years her senior.

The film Slogan was the first of a long line of collaborations during the relationship, which also included the infamous song 'Je t'aime... moi non plus,' a track so X-rated that it was denounced by the Vatican and banned from airplay in the UK.

As well as their shared body of work, the relationship also produced a child, Charlotte Gainsbourg who is now 43.

Despite their long relationship, the couple never married. 

Jane said of the decision: 'When I gave birth to our daughter Charlotte in 1971, Serge said it was the happiest night of his life. 

'He wanted us to marry, but I’d been married to John and that was enough. 

'Now I regret turning Serge down.'

Despite their intense love, the couple couldn't manage to make the relationship work long-term and Jane left Serge in 1980.

She later said of the decision: 'I left him after 12 years, partly because of his drinking.  

'I was starting to find others attractive too – that’s when our age gap made a difference.'

But Serge never got over his love for Jane, right up until the day he died of a heart attack on March 2, 1991. 

Jane said: 'Serge went on being in love with me and writing songs for me, and bought me a diamond three days before he died in 1991. 

'I couldn’t have had anyone who loved me more and I don’t think I’ll ever live in England again – I’m too spoilt in France.'
