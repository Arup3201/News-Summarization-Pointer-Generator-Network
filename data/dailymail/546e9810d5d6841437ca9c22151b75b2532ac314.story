The Bank of England has admitted it is ‘running behind’ on publishing the expenses of its £1million governor Mark Carney.

The central bank is due to disclose the expenses of its senior staff for the six months between October 2013 and March 2014 in the coming days.

But, having published the last set of details late, it is now struggling to put the latest claims into the public domain as planned.

The delay in releasing his expenses is embarrassing for the Bank and Mark Carney who promised to usher in an era of greater transparency when he took over as governor in July last year

The delay is embarrassing for the Bank and Mr Carney who promised to usher in an era of greater transparency when he took over as governor in July last year.

The Canadian’s expenses are particularly sensitive because of his bumper pay of £874,000 a year, which includes a £250,000 housing allowance.

The Bank also spent almost £200,000 moving Mr Carney and his family from Canada to London – taking his total earnings for his first year in charge to more than £1million.

His predecessor Lord King was paid £309,297 in his final year as governor.

The Bank only recently published details of the expenses racked up by Mr Carney for his first three months as governor – from July 2013 to September 2013.

They show he spent £31,905 including £8,727 on foreign business travel to Moscow, Geneva, St Petersburg and Frankfurt.

He spent a further £339 on a lunch and two dinners while his use of the Bank’s pool of ‘secure’ cars was shown to have been worth £22,069.

The Bank said it has ‘no legal requirement’ to publish the information but tries to do so with a lag of around six months in the interests of transparency and accountability.

But it said publication has been delayed due to major changes at the Bank over the past year.

‘The Bank’s most recent disclosure has exceeded the desired 6-month lag,’ a spokesman said. ‘The Bank is taking concerted steps not only to bring current reporting up to date, but to put in place a more timely and frequent reporting framework on a forward basis. Transparency and accountability is of paramount importance to the Bank, and these steps will ensure that we are at the forefront of best practices in this area.’
