Apple has been the subject of countless internet spoofs this month following the release of its new watch - and now the jokers are taking aim at the firm's 'flexible' iPhone 6 Plus.

Over the last 24 hours, #BentGate, #BendGate, and #BendGhazi have been trending on Twitter.

The social media storm is surrounding claims that Apple’s latest handsets change shape when placed in the pocket of a tight pair of jeans.

And while Apple has remained silent on 
the issue, the world has decided to give its amusing take on the 
controversy with spoof photos - that have now gone viral.

Smashed: Over the last 24 hours, #BentGate, #BendGate, and #BendGhazi have been trending on Twitter. One user posted an image of a traditional London telephone box, bent in half with the caption: 'I put my new phone in my back pocket #bendgate'

Twitter user, Shaun Moynihan from North Carolina, tweeted a pictured of a crumpled MacBook with the caption: 'Careful to NOT put your MacBook Pro in your back pocket.'

His image, which has already received more than 1,000 shares, received comments such as 'The iPhone 6 is the first phone that adapts to you...r pocket.'

Another user posted an image of a traditional London telephone box, bent in half, captioned: 'I put my new phone in my back pocket #bendgate.'

Even celebrities are being brought into the controversy. One image shows Uri Gellar, the illusionist famous for bending spoons, attempting to bend the iPhone 6 with his mind.

Latest design: It is believed that the thinner model, in addition to the use of aluminium metal in its design, causes the frame to deform. Pictured is a spoof advert showing the iPhone 6 Plus after a week. Image provided by gadgetlove.com

Meanwhile, a post about an iPhone 6 repair kit shows a photo of a simple wooden rolling pin to iron out the kinks.

Another anonymous user created an advert for Apple with the strapline: 'Not just a bigger display. A bendable display.'

The advert goes on to say: 'It's one thing to make a bigger display. It's something else entirely to make a bigger bendable display with brilliant colours and higher contract at even extreme viewing angles.

'But that's exactly what we did with the new Retina HDB display*.

'*Viewing angles may vary from pocket to pocket.'

It is believed that the thinner  model, in addition to the use of aluminium metal in its design, causes the frame to deform.

A video, uploaded to YouTube by user Lewis Hilsenteger, shows the iPhone 6 Plus bending using just his fingers. It has already been viewed more than 18.5 million times.

Today it was revealed that if your iPhone 6 Plus has become bent out of shape, Apple may offer you a replacement.

A support employee told The Next Web during a web chat that the decision would be '100 per cent up to the store' in which the device was returned to - and that it would be on a case-by-case basis.

But, the employee added that if, following an inspection, the damage met certain guidelines then a free replacement would be covered by the phone's warranty.

Apple has not released an official line about the replacements, and is not commenting on reports that the larger handset is vulnerable to being bent.

Following
 the unveiling of Apple’s smartwatch, internet 
jokers rushed to post pictures of their own version of the gadget. These
 included a red apple carved into a classic wristwatch design with a 
rounded face (pictured), created by Japanese Twitter user Hiromichi 
Shoji

Since the iPhone 6 Plus (pictured) launched on Friday, reports have emerged that 'a small but growing number' of owners are claiming the frame bends if the device is left in pockets for an extended period of time. An Apple support employee has since revealed the firm may replace bent devices - but only on a case-by-case basis

The reason for the bend is due to the iPhone 6 Plus being made out of aluminium.

Aluminium is a relatively soft metal and is fairly ductile and flexible so, if enough pressure is applied, it will bend and move.

According to iMore, no part of either of the new iPhones has more than a quarter of an inch (0.64cm) of aluminium in any spot.

This means that, in areas of the phones that are weakest, it’s possible it could be susceptible to bending.

This is noticeable in images, with many of the bends occurring near the volume buttons and the SIM card slot.

These areas have segments of the shell cut out to make room for the buttons and SIM card, so there is less aluminium - and they are more likely to bend.

To stop the phone bending, users need to ensure that they do not put increased pressure on the middle of the phone.

For example, do not have it sideways in a pocket, as your pocket will push it against your leg, possibly causing bending.

Putting it in your back pocket could also have a similar effect, so storing it in a shirt pocket or bag might be a better option.

Another option would be to make sure you have a case for the phone so that it can maintain its rigidity even when pressure is applied.

It
 has been reported that the thinner design of the 5.5-inch phone and the use of aluminum on 
the frame will cause the new iPhone 6 Plus (pictured) to bend if pressure is applied

The bendy feature of the new iPhone (pictured) has been met with wide criticism on social media

While many are creating spoof adverts, other Twitter users flagged up the fact that many handsets will bend under a similar amount of pressure.

App developer ‏@drbarnard said: 'It’s actually impressive that the 6 Plus doesn’t break. Seems like that much pressure on any device would do damage.'

While TechCrunch co-editor @panzer added: 'Just an anecdote: I carried around the iPhone 6 Plus for 5 days in a pocket at Disneyland on rides & coasters and did not bend it.'

Reports in 2012 claimed that the iPhone 5 had similar frame weaknesses.

The iPhone 5S release last year was met with similar complaints.

And as Apple's bad week continues, the firm was forced to remove its latest software update following reports it broke certain features on the new handset.

As its the second major issue to arise with Apple's newest iPhone since it was launched on Friday, many are claiming the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are the most troubled new products since the iPhone 4 and 'antennagate.'

Other devices have been released recently that were specifically designed to have a curved frame, including the LG G Flex (pictured). The phone is said to be more comfortable to hold, and easier to place in a back pocket
