Isthmian Premier Division side Maidstone United overcame the odds to beat League Two Stevenage and set up an FA Cup second round tie with Wrexham. 

Maidstone's Frannie Collins scored goals either side of a brilliant Darius Charles volley as the seventh-tier side pulled off a memorable 2-1 win against their supposedly superior opposition.

The Kent club took the lead in just the second minute when Jay May's first-time shot was saved weakly by Chris Day and Collin pounced on the rebound, guiding the ball in from close range. 

But hearts sank around the Gallagher Stadium two minutes into the second half as Stevenage repeated their opponents' feat. 

Charlie Lee swung in a cross that was expertly volleyed home by former Brentford man Darius Charles.

The game had time for one more twist and with just three minutes remaining Collin met Ben Greenhalgh's cross to head in the winner to send the home crowd in to pandemonium.

Jay Saunders' side now face an away trip to Wrexham on December 6th in their first FA Cup second round since the club were re-formed in 1992.
