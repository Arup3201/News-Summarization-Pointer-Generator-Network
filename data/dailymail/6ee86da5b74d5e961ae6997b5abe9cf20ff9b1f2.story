His latest work is featured in the second volume of his book 'Abandoned America: The Age of Consequences'.

He said: 'Indoor mega malls are a recent invention and they are swiftly becoming obsolete.

'Many communities are witnessing them struggling to stay in business and everybody has memories of visiting them when they were thriving.

'Because of the memories we share of visiting spaces like this in the not terribly distant past, abandoned malls can be an eerie presence.

'Particularly when combined with the smiling, enticing advertising still present in them for stores no longer in existence.

'The idea of the shiny, consumerist bubble bursting is relevant to our own time and chilling in that sense.'

Cleveland.com reports that once the mall is torn down workers will build an industrial park filled with factories and businesses which may make way for over 100,000 jobs.
