A group of male politicians have been caught on camera laughing as their fellow MP secretly sniffs a female colleague's coat during a vote in the Greek parliament.

To the amusement of the 'sexist and vulgar' group, Grigoris Psarianos can be seen smelling his fellow MP's top after she had taken it off and was sitting several benches in front of him.

The incident occurred during the first round of voting to appoint the country's new president last week.

It was done with the assistance of Petros Tatsopoulosas, a fellow MP who held the coat for Psarianos while he leaned in to smell it.

The coat's owner, Independent MP Rachel Makri, later said the men were 'dullards, and I don't spend my time with dullards', KeepTalkingGreece reported.

Both Tatsopoulosas and Psarianos are former members of the left-wing Syriza party and its newspaper wasted no time labelling them as 'sexist and vulgar' in the wake of the incident.

Meanwhile, Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras said today he hoped to avoid a snap general election next year after an improved result for his candidate after the second round of the parliamentary vote.

As expected, Greek lawmakers failed to reach a majority in favour of the official candidate, Stavros Dimas, but an improved total from the first round left government lawmakers more optimistic ahead of the decisive final round on December 29.

Dimas won 168 votes in the 300-seat parliament, 12 short of the 180 he will need to be elected next week. It was eight more than he scored in the first ballot last week when the coat-sniffing incident occurred.

If he misses the threshold, snap elections will be held, potentially handing power to the Syriza party which wants to renegotiate Greece's international bailout and roll back the austerity policies of recent years.
