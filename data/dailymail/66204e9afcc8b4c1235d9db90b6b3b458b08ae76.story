Labour's policy on university tuition fees is in chaos after a plan by Ed Miliband to slash fees to £6,000 a year blew up in his face.

The party leader had sought to curry favour with students by announcing that a Labour government would reduce the maximum annual cost of £9,000 by a third.

But he refused yesterday to say if the plan would be in Labour’s next election manifesto and his higher education spokesman John Denham announced that a graduate tax was still only a ‘long-term aspiration’.

Pledge: Labour leader Ed Miliband said his party would slash university tuition fees by £3000

Mr Miliband made the eye-catching 
pledge at the start of a difficult party conference at which his 
leadership is under scrutiny and polls suggest he is deeply unpopular.

He was immediately accused of a cynical U-turn, reversing his previous 
opposition to any tuition fees which cost more than the current £3,000 a
 year.

The new policy would be paid for by 
forcing graduates earning more than  £65,000 a year to pay a higher rate
 of interest on their student loans and by axing the Government’s 
proposed corporation tax cut for the banks.

The announcement was designed to 
court Liberal Democrat voters and hard-up students who felt betrayed by 
Nick Clegg’s decision to back a tripling of fees from £3,000 to £9,000 a
 year.

But the plan was summarily rejected 
by the National Union of Students as of no benefit to the poor, since 
only graduates earning more than £35,000 would benefit.

In an interview with two Sunday 
newspapers Mr Miliband said he wanted to make it easier for people to go
 to university and not feel burdened by debt. 'Parents up and down the 
country are incredibly worried about their sons and daughters,' he told 
The Sunday Mirror.

Under
 the plans, graduates earning more than £65,000 a year would pay higher 
interest on their student loans to help fund the lower cap. The rest 
would be found by cancelling the government's cut in corporation tax for
 banks.

Mr Miliband told the conference he would tax bankers and top-earning graduates to fund the cut, which would cost the public purse £1billion

Mr Miliband 
told The Observer that David Cameron and Nick Clegg risked destroying 
the ambition of a generation by 'loading the costs of paying off the 
deficit onto our young people'.

Ditching
 the government's proposed cut in corporation tax from 28 per cent to 23
 per cent was 'fair' because 'we shouldn't be cutting taxes for the 
banks at the moment', he said.

But
 according to coalition sources the corporation tax cut for banks was 
already offset by the bank levy and suggested better-off graduates would
 find ways to get around the higher rates. 

Universities
 minister David Willetts said Labour's proposals represented a cynical 
u-turn. 'Ed Miliband promised a graduate tax and now he's accepting fees
 have to increase to finance universities in tough times,' he said.

Tessa Jowell said the previous Labour government lost the 
confidence of voters because it was addicted to the 'crack cocaine' of 
courting the media

'So why should students trust anything he says? He says one thing to become leader and within a year does a u-turn.

'It makes Labour's vote last year against fee increases look completely cynical.'

Ministers
 initially claimed that fees over £6,000 would be the exception but 
official figures show more than a third of English universities have 
been granted permission to charge fees of £9,000 from 2012.

Students starting degree courses from next year face average tuition fees of almost £8,500.

Mr
 Miliband also told the BBC this morning that the coalition's austerity 
measures were 'not working' and he urged the government to change 
course.

He accused the 
coalition of failing to meet their deficit reduction plans and called 
for a temporary cut in VAT to help boost the economy.

Mr Miliband told the Andrew Marr Show: 'I
 think we've seen a big change over the last year, which is a year ago 
there was a contested argument about whether the government strategy 
should work.

"It's
 not working, it's not working for Britain because unemployment is going
 up, and it's not working even to cut the deficit because unless you 
grow the economy you can't cut your deficit.'

In
 an interview with the Independent on Sunday shadow Olympics Minister 
Tessa Jowell said the previous Labour government lost the confidence of 
voters because it was addicted to the 'crack cocaine' of courting the 
media rather than listening to the public.

She
 said that Labour should have taken a harder line with Rupert Murdoch's 
News International following allegations of phone hacking when her party
 was in power.

Ms Jowell 
said: 'What we've got to accept is that in the country more widely, 
nobody is listening. The biggest battle that Labour has at the moment is
 to be relevant and to be heard... For so many people, it's just white 
noise.

'I think that 
the mistake that we made - it's a bit like the crack cocaine of 
politics, isn't it? Getting a good write-up, or the horror of a bad 
write-up.'

But former deputy Prime Minister John Prescott took a pop at Ms Jowell's comments on Twitter.

'Tessa.
 So Labour was addicted to Murdoch like 'crack cocaine,' he tweeted and 
added, 'You spent Xmas Eve & Boxing Day with Rebekah Wade! Any more 
NI dos?'

Stance: Mr Miliband claims the coalition's austerity measures are 'not working' and he urged the government to change course

Harriet Harman said the party will back public sector strikes if the Government remains 'unreasonable' in talks with trade unions over efforts to secure agreement over pension reforms.

Ed Miliband urged the government to engage in 'serious' negotiations but refused to say whether he would support industrial action.

He urged ministers not to act as if they were 'spoiling for a fight' with the unions amid anger over proposed changes to public sector pensions.

Miliband spoke out against a strike by teachers and civil servants in June and  would not be drawn on if he would support a fresh wave of action, telling BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: 'I'm not interested in ifs.'

But he added: 'Strikes are a sign of failure, we've got to avoid them and there is a big responsibility on Government to stop them happening.'

Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB, one of several unions planning to ballot workers for strikes later this year, said the Government was attacking the retirement incomes and pension rights of millions of workers over its controversial plans to increase contributions by 3.2 per cent.

Frankly, if the Labour Party cannot stand up and support people defending themselves and their families, then what does it stand for?'

Mr Miliband 
also announced that he would be championing a package of internal 
reforms already approved by the Labour Party's ruling National Executive
 Committee.

The changes, which party members will
 be voting on at the upcoming conference, include giving non-member 
'registered voters' the right to have a say in party leadership 
elections if they reach 50,000 in number.

The NEC has also agreed to review conference voting arrangements and the weight given to union votes.

Mr Miliband said: 'I want to change our party to make us more outward-looking, so we spend our time talking to the public and not ourselves.'

In his keynote speech on Tuesday Mr Miliband will outline proposals to force energy firms to pool electricity they produce to encourage smaller firms to join the market and force down spiralling fuel bills.

Several senior Labour politicians, including former cabinet members Alan Johnson and John Prescott and shadow health minister Diane Abbot have signed a letter in The Observer today urging the leadership to back the Labour Diversity Fund campaign which would encourage more people from working class backgrounds to become party candidates.

'If the Labour Party is to continue to be the true people's party into the 21st century and wishes to win back the five million predominantly working class voters it's lost since 1997, then it has to reflect those who it wishes to represent,' they said in the letter.
