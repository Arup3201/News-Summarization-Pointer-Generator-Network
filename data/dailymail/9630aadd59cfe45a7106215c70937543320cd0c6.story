Dominique Strauss-Kahn is suing a pimp for opening a brothel bearing the initials DSK, the disgraced former IMF chief's widely used nickname.

Dominique Alderweireld, aka 'Dodo la Saumure', is set to open the 'Dodo Sex Klub' in the town of Blaton in Belgium, where prostitution and owning brothels are legal.

The French-born pimp has already been linked to alleged orgies attended by Strauss-Kahn, whose public profile was ruined by a sex scandal involving a hotel maid in New York City.

Strauss-Kahn's lawyers said they were suing Alderweireld, 64, for deliberately choosing a name that 'reproduces his (Strauss-Kahn's) initials which identify him to all.'

A former potential presidential candidate in France, Strauss-Kahn is well known by his initials DSK there and in neighbouring French-speaking countries such as Belgium and Switzerland.

Dodo la Saumure, who is currently facing charges in France of aggravated pimping and supplying prostitutes to Strauss-Kahn, was not immediately available for comment.

But he had earlier told AFP that the name was a good publicity stunt.

He said the name of the establishment, which will be staffed by 'seven girls, of whom one is a transsexual' was 'commercially brilliant... as everybody talks about DSK.'

Strauss-Kahn was forced to resign as head of the International Monetary Fund following his 2011 arrest for an alleged sexual assault on a New York hotel maid.

Criminal charges in the case were dropped and at the end of 2012, Strauss-Kahn settled a civil suit brought by the maid by paying her undisclosed damages, which reportedly exceeded $1.5million.

Alderweireld has said he plans to open another sex establishment in Belgium called the Carlton, the name of a posh hotel in the northern French city of Lille where Strauss-Kahn attended sex parties.

Strauss-Kahn's lawyers insist he had no idea the women taking part in the parties were prostitutes. But prosecutors say he was central to the organisation of what amounted to orgies.

Last August, a French judge sent Strauss-Kahn and 12 others - including Alderweireld - for trial on charges of aggravated pimping as part of an organised gang. Alderweireld also denies the charges.

A ruling is expected sometime this year.

Saumure, meaning brine, is the salt oil that fish in this part of Europe are often served in, especially mackerel, the French slang for pimp.Â
