Juventus won't be able to keep Paul Pogba if the young midfielder decides to leave Turin this summer, according to the club's general manager Giuseppe Marotta.

The French midfielder has been linked with the biggest clubs in Europe with the likes of Real Madrid, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain reportedly showing interest.

Although Marotta admits it may be difficult to hang onto Pogba should the youngster wish to leave, the Juve chief hopes Pogba will remain in Turin.  

Paul Pogba is yet to show any indication that he wants to leave Juventus, according to Giuseppe Marotta

The 22-year-old midfielder is a target for clubs including Manchester United, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain

Marotta told Corriere della Sera: 'Pogba is the protagonist of his own destiny and if he decides to leave then we can't stop him,” the Bianconeri chief told Corriere della Sera.

'Pogba has not indicated a willingness to leave, though. The problem will come when the player is offered a contract that is two or three times what he already earns. We're talking in the tens of millions per year.'  

Pogba has scored seven goals and set up two more in 22 league appearances to help Juve remain on course for their fourth successive scudetto.

The Frenchman is under contract with the Turin giants until June 2019.
