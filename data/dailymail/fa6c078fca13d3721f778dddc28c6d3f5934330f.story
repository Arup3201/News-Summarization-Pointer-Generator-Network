Zinedine Zidane revealed he would be interested in taking charge of the French national team at some point in the future.

The 42-year-old served as an assistant coach to Carlo Ancelotti last season at Real Madrid and is now coaching the club's reserve team.

Zidane, who had been linked to the head coaching position at French club Bordeaux before taking over Madrid's reserves, told La Provence newspaper that he is interested in the job.

The former Juventus and Real midfielder said: 'I'm ambitious. I wore this shirt and now that I'm on the other side of the fence, this is an option.'

Current France manager Didier Deschamps played alongside Zidane when France won the World Cup in 1998 and European Championships in 2000.

The French pair also played together at Juventus for three years before Deschamps moved to Chelsea in 1999. 

Zidane's exceptional international career ended on something a sour note at the World Cup in 2006. 

Having come out of retirement to lead Les Bleus to the final, Zidane headbutted Italian defender Marco Materazzi and was subsequently sent off. 

But now it appears as if the former Ballon d'Or winner may want a chance to add one last chapter to the story.
