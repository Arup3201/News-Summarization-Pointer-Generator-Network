Lewis Hamilton says he was shocked his team asked him to move over for Nico Rosberg during Sunday's action-packed Hungarian Grand Prix.

Hamilton, who finished third behind Daniel Ricciardo and Fernando Alonso after starting from the pit-lane, and Rosberg were running on different strategies when the Briton was asked to allow his title rival through.

But Hamilton, irked by the order from the Mercedes pit wall, refused to adhere to the instruction, saying: 'I'm not slowing down for Nico. If he gets close enough to overtake, he can overtake.'

Rosberg spent eight laps in Hamilton's turbulent air before making his final pit stop with 14 laps of the race remaining. The German, who started on pole, then finished one place behind Hamilton.

'I was very, very shocked that the team would ask me to do that,' said Hamilton afterwards.

'He didn't get close enough to overtake, I was not going to lift off and lose ground to Fernando or Daniel, so it was a bit strange.'

Hamilton reduced the gap to Rosberg to 11 points in the drivers' championship with his exemplary charge through the field.

'If I'd let him past he would have beaten me,' Hamilton added. 'Also, I would have lost points to Nico.

'Obviously I was in the same race as him. Just because he had one more stop than me doesn't mean I wasn't in the same race. He would have had the opportunity to pull away and then I thought he would come back and overtake me.'

At last year's German Grand Prix, Hamilton asked Mercedes to instruct Rosberg to let him past when they were running on different strategies.

Rosberg did, and Hamilton finished in fifth, four places ahead of his team-mate. But the Briton seemed surprised by the stance from Mercedes today.

'I'm not quite sure what the situation was there. I'll go and talk to everyone and give them the benefit of the doubt, I'm sure it was perhaps for the right reasons.

'Ultimately I would have lost points today so it definitely feels strange, but I think it was the right decision for myself.'
