The Middletons have developed into a family of entrepreneurs

They have set out to dominate the world of parties, baking and marshmallows.

But for James his knack for business began at the tender age of 11, when he thought up a special way of picking gooseberries.

The Duchess of Cambridge's brother claims he 'made his cash' gathering the fruit after thinking up a technique which helped him avoid the prickles.

The 26-year-old would spend the summer holidays working and said:
 'I was up at 5.30am to work as a fruit picker. I made my cash in 
gooseberries — no one else wanted to do prickles, but I had a 
technique.'

Mr Middleton claimed he made £400 from the venture and spent it on an old car, even though he was too young to drive.

And as he has grew into a businessman, he says his family's love of 'bunting' mean they are 'great' at hosting a soiree.

He said: 'Celebrations are great fun. Bunting and this and that and the other.'

In an interview with the Evening Standard, following the launch of his new marshmallow venture, Boomf, he also admitted his dyslexia was so severe he couldn't spell his own name.

In January, it emerged Mr Middleton was the man behind a service offering to print your Instagram photographs on to the sweets, nine of which sell for £12.

He launched the company with Andy Bell of Mint Digital (who used to place Instagrams on fridge magnets) and in three short months they have generated £100,000.

The Duchess of Cambridge's younger brother says he had a special system for picking gooseberries when he was younger, so he didn't get 'prickled'

'People are intrigued by them. Nobody’s ever seen this before', he said.

In line with the growth of his business, he is sporting a new beard which he says has led to comments suggesting he looks like Tsar Nicholas II.

For the past year, Middleton has been 
in a relationship with the presenter Donna Air. 'Am I getting married? 
What a ridiculous question.'

He then struggles to remember his girlfriend's age, questioning whether she is 33 or 34.

Mr Middleton's first venture is alleged to have racked up debts of around £36,000.

His cake and bread company 
Nice Group London Limited made the losses in the 12 months
 to March 2013, the latest accounts filed showed.
