Radamel Falcao has scored more than half his goals by getting on the end of crosses...

52.8% - Porto (72 goals, 38 from crosses)

51.4% - Atletico Madrid (70, 36)

36.4% - Monaco (11, 4)

TOTAL: 51% (153 goals, 78 from crosses)

Radamel Falcao feeds off crosses. Manchester United's newest striker craves them and, more often than not, makes himself a menace to defenders.

Since arriving in Europe, Falcao has scored more than half his goals by meeting the end of a cross.

The 28-year-old owes a sizeable portion of his records at Porto, Atletico Madrid and Monaco to that very ability. Portugal, Spain and France have been ticked off the list, England is next.

Those at Old Trafford can only hope Falcao remains as aggressive as his El Tigre nickname suggests when he enters the Premier League den.

Radamel Falcao will look to keep up his extraordinary cross-to-goal conversion rate in the Premier League

United have put in the second-most crosses in the Premier League but completed the fewest!

78 - Southampton (14 successful)

65 - Manchester United (3 successful)

64 - Newcastle United (10 successful) 

9.42% - Stoke

7.32% - Aston Villa 

4.62% - Manchester United

Trouble is, where will those crosses come from? 

United, having played three Premier League games under new manager Louis van Gaal, boast the lowest completion rate. Sixty-five attempted, just three successful.

They are yet to win but the cavalry has arrived.

Angel di Maria registered more assists than any other player in Europe's top five leagues last season. Seventeen to be exact.

Daley Blind, United's new defender and makeshift midfielder, delivered what was surely the cross of the 2014 World Cup. It was the 24-year-old's 50-yard diagonal ball that met Robin van Persie's flying header against Spain.

What Van Gaal wouldn't give for an exact repeat against Queens Park Rangers on Sunday.  

Van Persie, despite such brilliance in Brazil, is among the culprits at Old Trafford that may be in awe of Falcao's record. Since 2012, the former Arsenal striker has scored 24 per cent of his goals from crosses. Wayne Rooney? 23 per cent. The now-sold Danny Welbeck? 20.

Louis van Gaal will hope Radamel Falcao can be just as lethal in the box as he has been in Europe so far

24% - Van Persie (38 goals, 9 from crosses)

23% - Rooney (30, 7)

20% - Welbeck (10, 2) 

Falcao should not be short of putting his talent to good use, given United are second only to Southampton with the most crosses in the league so far. 

The man sacrificed for the Colombia international's arrival was Welbeck. 

The 23-year-old joined Arsenal for £16million while the transfer window was wedged open, despite the 11pm deadline having been and gone.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger had little hesitation picking up after Van Gaal, though. The Frenchman reckons he's inherited a 'fox in the box' not dissimilar to Ian Wright and Thierry Henry.

The England international, though, has some way to go before he is on par with Falcao's record.
