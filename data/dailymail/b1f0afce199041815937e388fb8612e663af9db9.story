Baroness Thatcher’s ashes will be buried alongside those of her late husband Sir Denis in the cemetery of the Royal Hospital in Chelsea.

It is understood that Lady Thatcher, who has long been a supporter of the hospital, made the request before her death.

The hospital is home to the Chelsea Pensioners and features the Margaret Thatcher Infirmary, a care home and hospice that she opened alongside Prince Charles in 2009.

Lady Thatcher’s attachment to the Royal Hospital, where she also attended church service on Sundays at its chapel, is marked by a portrait of her in the infirmary.

Her family has asked for those wishing to pay their respects to make a donation to the hospital, rather than buying flowers.

Sir Denis, who died in 2003 aged 88, is buried beside a simple white marble marker reading ‘Sir Denis Thatcher Bt 1915-2003’.

Members of the Chelsea Pensioners will also play a central part in Lady Thatcher’s funeral, making up a military guard of honour on the steps of St. Paul’s Cathedral.

This latest detail emerged yesterday, as Sir Mark Thatcher said his mother would be ‘greatly honoured as well as humbled’ by the Queen attending her funeral.

In his first appearance since Baroness Thatcher’s death, he said: ‘First of all and most importantly I would like to say how enormously proud and equally grateful we are that Her Majesty the Queen has agreed to attend the service next week at St Paul’s. I know my mother would be greatly honoured as well as humbled by her presence.’

The Queen and Prince Philip have broken with tradition by agreeing to attend the funeral – effectively elevating it to a state occasion.

Grief: Speaking for the first time since Baroness Thatcher's death on Monday, he said his mother had been blessed with 'a long life, and a very full one', but her death was 'without doubt a very sad moment'

Messages: Sir Mark added the messages of support
 following his mother's death would be a 'source of encouragement and 
strength as we face the inevitable days ahead'

Sir Mark, 59, was speaking outside his mother’s five-storey Victorian town house in Belgravia, Central London, after cutting short a holiday in Barbados with his second wife Sarah Jane Russell.

It has emerged that both his wife and his ex-wife, Diane Beckett, who lives in Texas, will be at the funeral next Wednesday as his mother had requested they both attend.

Mrs Beckett is expected to be accompanied by the couple’s two children, Michael, 24, and 19-year-old Amanda – Lady Thatcher’s only grandchildren.

Speaking calmly in a steady voice, Sir Mark said the ‘inevitable conclusion’ of the illness his mother suffered had not made her death any easier to bear.

He added: ‘By any measure my mother was blessed with a long life and a very full one.’

He said the family ‘has quite simply been overwhelmed’ by ‘messages of support, condolence, of every kind, from far and wide’.

‘I know that my mother would be pleased they have come from people of all walks of life,’ he said.

Before yesterday’s statement, Sir 
Mark and his twin sister Carol Thatcher, who lives in Klosters, had both
 been grieving privately.

Carol is also said to have returned to London after her mother died following a stroke on Monday.

Sir Mark, who has spent 25 years 
living and working abroad, made regular trips home, usually every four 
to six weeks, to see his mother.

Carol also made regular trips back to 
Britain to see their mother. But Lady Thatcher was said to have been 
much closer to her son, now believed to have settled in Marbella, Spain,
 even though he has often been a source of anxiety.

It was only three years after his 
mother entered 10 Downing Street in 1979 that Sir Mark first hit the 
headlines – when he got lost in the desert competing in the Paris-Dakar 
rally and was missing for six days. It was one of the rare occasions 
when the Iron Lady shed a tear in public.

Sir Mark later said: ‘The biggest story of 1982 was the Falklands War.

‘The second biggest also involved my mother... and me.’
