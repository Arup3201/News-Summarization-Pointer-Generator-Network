Twenty one of the bars were European, 16 North American, six Australian, four Asian and three Latin American.  

London - crowned 'the cocktail capital of the world' - boasted more bars in the top 50 than any other city with eight bars listed overall.

Artesian head bartender Alex Kratena said of scooping the top spot: 'It's the fear that is the creative engine.

'It's not the pressure of being voted The World's Best Bar - we know one day we will not be - it's the challenge of doing things better every day.'

Chicago's Aviary was awarded 13th place in the new list

The best bars in the world: Nottingham Forest in Milan made in into 15th place

A luxurious cocktail served at Singapore's Hong Kong Street, which scooped 10th place

Edinburgh's Bramble bar won the Best in Scotland prize, and was the only UK bar outside of London to make the list.

Other European highlights include Milan's Nottingham Forest named as Italy's best bar at  15.

Germany boasted three bars within the top 50 and Holland has two bars in the list with Amsterdam's Tales Spirits joining Door 74.

Both Floreira Atlantico in Buenos Aires  and Tokyo's High Five retained their crown as the best bars in Latin America and Asia, respectively, for the second consecutive year.  

Sydney's The Baxter Inn was also reunited with the crown as the best bar in Australasia for the second year running. Australia has six bars - all based in Melbourne or Sydney - featured in the top 50. 

Speaking at the event, The World's 50 Best Bars editor, Hamish Smith said: 'It's possible that Artesian's hat trick of wins will never be repeated.

'It takes a special kind of bar to win The World's 50 Best Bars poll, win again and then come back for more. 

'Head bartender Alex Kratena says it's the fear that drives him – whatever it is, he and his assistant Simone Caporale are running a bar that has more ticks than there are boxes. 

'Outlandishly imaginative cocktails in a five-star setting with the kind of hospitality that makes every visit memorable - it doesn't get much better than that.
