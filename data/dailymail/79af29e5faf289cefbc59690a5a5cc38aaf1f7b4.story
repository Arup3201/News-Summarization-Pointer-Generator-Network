When asked, the average adult estimated their wash bag contents to be worth £52.23 - a third of the true amount

They are the everyday essentials you never think twice about slinging in the supermarket trolley.

But the chances are your toiletries are costing you more than you realise, with many of us spending hundreds every year.

A new poll shows the contents of the average British wash bag is worth an incredible £156.69, although 80 per cent of us have no idea just how much we are spending.

When asked, the average adult estimated their wash bag contents to be worth £52.23 - a third of the true amount.

In total, the British public now spend more than £14 billion on toiletry products each year.

And it's not women - the survey also revealed a quarter of all men questioned now use expensive beauty products as part of their daily routine.

Researchers say the enormous cost is down to increasingly more sophisticated beauty regimes, with many people using several different creams every day just on their skin.

And because most people buy products individually when they need to be replenished, the full cost is hard to estimate.

The survey, by Travelodge, found 50 per cent of men have now ditched soap and water in favour of a more sophisticated daily beauty regime.

This included cleansing, toning and using anti-aging skin care products such as face serum, eye cream and moisturiser.

One in four male respondents admitted to splashing out on premium brands usually used by women.

The survey of 3,000 British adults was undertaken after the hotel chain saw a rise in the number of toiletry bags being left behind in its 521 hotels.

In the last 12 months, hotel staff has spent hundreds of hours uniting 10,000 wash bags with their owners.

In one case a customer paid over a £100 for a courier to pick up her designer toiletry bag, which contained more than £1,000 worth of items.

Over half of adults surveyed stated they have two toiletry bags on the go at the same time, for home, holidays, at the gym or for work.

The enormous cost is down to more sophisticated beauty regimes and some people use several creams a day

A third of women surveyed stated their toiletry bag is the most important item they pack when travelling away from home.

A fifth of women polled admitted they purchase more expensive toiletry items when they are going on holiday as it feels like a special treat.

One in five women think nothing of spending £50 on anti-ageing creams and own 10 different bottles of expensive perfume.

The study also explored the beauty regimes and habits of British men and women.

Shakila Ahmed from Travelodge said: 'The main reason to why so many Britons are clueless to the actual value of their toiletry bag is due to the fact that most adults purchase their toiletry essentials on ad-hoc basics.

'It's very rarely that you would go out and purchase all items in one go therefore you don't really know the exact total cost as you have brought the items singularly.'
