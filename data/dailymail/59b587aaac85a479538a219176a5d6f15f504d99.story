Micah Richards was put through his paces for the first time at training following the completion of his loan move from Manchester City to Fiorentina.

The England international joined teammates including former Premier League stars Guiseppe Rossi and Alberto Aquiliani for some stretching exercises in the gym before heading outdoors for light training.

Former Manchester City teammate Nigel de Jong, now with AC Milan, sent Richards a message on Twitter welcoming him to Italy with the hashtag #Neighbourfromhell (below).

Richards has spoken of his excitement at experiencing a new culture and claimed he would consider remaining in Serie A if the season-long loan proves successful. The Viola finished fourth in the league last season and are seeking a Champions League place this term.

The 26-year-old became disillusioned at the Premier League champions after an unfortunate injury while playing for Team GB at the London 2012 Olympics saw him lose his place to Pablo Zabaleta in the Blues first team.

The powerful defender only made two Premier League appearances last season and played 10 games in total, including five domestic cup ties..

Richards was offered more money to remain at the Etihad but decided to leave in search of more playing time, eventually agreeing a deadline day move that saw Manchester City secure a £1 million loan fee.

West Ham had been interested in a temporary move for  the right-back but could not afford to match his wages of around £75,000 - with sources at the club claiming he was not prepared to lower his demands.
