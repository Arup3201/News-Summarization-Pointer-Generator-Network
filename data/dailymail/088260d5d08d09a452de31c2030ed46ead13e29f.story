As the players in blue shirts trudged downcast into the tunnel, manager Sean Dyche cut a path between them towards the far corner of the King Power Stadium where travelling fans were united in jubilation.

For Burnley, who ended a goal drought stretching back to mid-August by twice coming from behind to draw — the point-saver arriving in the sixth minute of added time — this resembled a victory they are yet to savour in the Premier League.

The two promoted sides have had vastly different starts in the top flight. While Burnley have four points from four draws, Leicester have scored 10 goals at home, a record that surpasses any other side in the League.

The conflicting ways Dyche and his opposite number Nigel Pearson greeted the final whistle reflected different expectations.

‘I thought it was much more a reminder of what we are about,’ said Dyche. ‘We started with a will and a demand. They were terrific from start to finish.’

Pearson, who enjoyed the high of a dramatic 5-3 win over Manchester United in Leicester’s last home game, was seething. ‘I’m annoyed,’ he said, acknowledging that Leicester, who had the lion’s share of the chances, missed a plum opportunity to climb to fifth.

‘We’re better than we were last season and they’re not as good,’ he added. 

‘It’s disappointing because we should have won. It was a scrappy game, they didn’t come here to play fluid football, they came to be difficult to beat.’

Burnley have lifted themselves off the bottom of the table by being consistent in defence, with the exception of last week’s thrashing at West Bromwich. 

Goals, meanwhile, have been hard to come by. Their only other goal this campaign came in the 14th minute of the opening game of the season, a match they eventually lost 3-1 to Chelsea.

So Michael Kightly’s strike, which levelled the score after Leicester’s opener, was very sweet after a wait of 10 hours and 54 minutes.

However, it was three minutes too late to avoid breaking an unwanted club record set in the 1970-71 season of the longest spell without a goal.

‘I know we’re creating chances,’ said Dyche. ‘I thought we made a lot of good chances today but it’s the quality of the chances that are important. 

'We’re trying to build the team and make it learn quickly. Leicester have been trying for this for years.’

Leicester’s deserved breakthrough came in the 33rd minute with a smart finish from Jeff Schlupp, for his first Premier League goal. 

Riyad Mahrez used his quick feet to confound Scott Arfield and squeeze a ball into the box which Ghana star Schlupp took sweetly, angling into the top corner of the net. 

Burnley made their mark when an Arfield cross found Lukas Jutkiewicz, who knocked the ball down with his head. 

Kightly swept into the box to drive the ball past Kasper Schmeichel.

Dyche, who has acknowledged his side need to improve in front of goal, slung his water bottle towards nearby advertising hoardings and raised his hands above his head in applause before letting a few expletives fly. It had been a while.

Leicester, who have lost just once at home in their last 19 games, took just one minute to restore their lead through Mahrez, who has experienced a swift rise at Leicester since arriving from French Ligue Two side Le Havre nine months ago. 

The Algeria international burst into the box to head in a cross from the excellent Jamie Vardy, who combined well with Schlupp in the build-up to the goal.

But a trip by Matty James on Arfield late in added time resulted in a free-kick and substitute Ross Wallace stepped up to fire home into the top corner from 20 yards to dramatically earn a share of the spoils, to the delight of Dyche.
