The body of a man was found by a group of children at a popular beach in Sydney's east on Monday afternoon.

Believed to be in his 50s, the man was found at Clovelly in Gordon's Bay near Coogee just before 12:45, following reports that a man had been injured.

Police say a number of children were playing on the rocks when they discovered the man. They alerted their father who contacted police.

'It's unclear whether he has jumped or fell, it was a spearhead injury, he didn't drown,' said media SLS spokesman Matt Miller

Paramedics were called and went to treat the man who had severe head injuries but he died at the scene. 

Surf Life Saving NSW say the man died after falling off a cliff face. 

'It's unclear whether he has jumped or fell, it was a spearhead injury, he didn't drown,' said media spokesman Matt Miller.

'Lifesavers from Coogee and Clovelly attended, as well as the offshore rescue boat, but it was clear when they got there the man was deceased.'

'Ambulance declared him dead straight away,' he said.

Police have commenced investigating the incident and are following initial inquiries and believe the man was walking along a track beside a cliff face when he slipped and fell onto rocks below.

The grim discovery was made during a busy period, with a number of beach goers watching as police and surf life savers recovered the body.

A NSW police spokesman said they didn't know how long the body had been there.  

The man’s identity is still to be confirmed, however he was found wearing a blue long-sleeved shirt, chequered grey shorts and a backpack. 

Police will prepare a report for the Coroner and are appealing for any witnesses, or anyone who may have seen the man leading up to his death to come forward.
