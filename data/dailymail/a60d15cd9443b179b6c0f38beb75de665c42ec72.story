Sportsmail's investigation into alleged racial, sexist and homophobic messages sent by Malky Mackay and Iain Moody shocked football to it's very core on Wednesday night. Here's how those involved in the game reacted...

SAM ALLARDYCE - West Ham manager 

You can be lost in this game very quickly. You can take years to build up your reputation – there’s lots of top-quality managers of my era that very rarely get an opportunity now.

Investigation: Malky Mackay (right) and Iain Moody have been accused of being racist, sexist and homophobicin a series of text messages dating back to their time together at Cardiff City

LORD OUSELEY - Chairman, Kick It Out

These revelations are further confirmation of how football is tainted with racism, sexism, homophobia and anti-Semitism, and the culture which continues to exist throughout the game.

IBRAHIM FARAH - Former Cardiff player

No one knows what happens behind the scenes in football clubs. At the time when you’re a young pro, no one will listen. People would listen to the manager not me so I chose to keep my mouth shut.

KEITH MILLEN - Palace caretaker manager

Iain Moody was brought in to recruit players, and the chairman will look at that. Each day something’s unfolded, something’s come out, it’s been difficult. I had a chat with the players about staying focused.

Difficult: Crystal Palace caretaker manager Keith Millen has told his Eagles players they must remain focused

TIM HARTLEY - Chairman of the Cardiff City Supporters’ Trust 

The Trust condemns without reservation any racist, homophobic and sexist comments whenever and wherever they are made.

THE GAY FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS’ NETWORK

The GFSN is saddened to hear reports of alleged homophobic comments. Homophobia is still a problem in football. We will be following the story closely and asking the FA to fully investigate the allegations.

STAN COLLYMORE - Former Liverpool and England striker

LMA statement. ******* disgraceful. Institutional acceptance of the ‘banter’ of casual racism.  

Disgraceful: Former Liverpool and England striker Stan Collymore was unhappy with the LMA statement

WOMEN IN FOOTBALL

We’re gravely concerned by recent revelations of sexist, racist, homophobic & anti-semitic texts. This year has shown us that sexism is endemic in the game. It should not be acceptable to make bigoted comments... irrespective of whether these are made publicly or privately.

JASON ROBERTS - Former Blackburn striker

It’s OK people, nothing to see, it was just banter! Ladies and Gentlemen, the LMA...OMG! I’m done, the LMA said it better than I ever could. They are actually being serious! Somebody drafted that...WOW!

Shock: Former Premier League striker Jason Roberts couldn't believe the LMA's statement was serious

The LMA wish to clarify the position in relation to recent reports and speculation regarding matters alleged to have arisen during Malky Mackay’s time at Cardiff City FC.

In the course of a search by the Club in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff during Mr Mackay’s employment at Cardiff, in relation to other matters, it emerged that Malky had, it seems, sent a couple of one line texts that were, with the benefit of hindsight, very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures. These were two text messages sent in private at a time Malky felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter. That said, Malky believes he could and should have conducted himself better on these two isolated occasions. The precise details need to remain private for the time being until any FA process is complete.

The LMA does not condone in any way any potential breach of equal opportunities laws but would also point out that out of over 10,000 text messages and 70,000 documents produced over a long period of time it may not be a complete surprise that some inappropriate comments can sometimes be made by employees, like Malky, working under great pressure in highly charged situations. If Malky has caused any offence by these two isolated matters he would, however, wish to sincerely apologise.

Malky finds it strange that these matters were only raised with the FA and in the media now, 8 months after his employment ended and the day before he was reported as being offered the opportunity to become manager of Crystal Palace FC.

Malky is also very concerned about seriously inaccurate and misleading reports of his alleged involvement in these matters in the media. It has never been alleged that he wrote any homophobic or sexist messages and he has confirmed that he did not do so. Further, there are incorrect and damaging suggestions that he sent a whole host of offensive and unpleasant messages that are simply not true and which give a grossly distorted and unfair view of Malky’s involvement in this matter. Malky looks forward to matters being put straight in due course, following any investigation of this matter.

Malky cannot of course comment on the nature of any conduct or communications alleged to have been made by others.

Malky has said that he will be fully co-operating with any FA investigation and that he looks forward to putting the record straight thereafter.
