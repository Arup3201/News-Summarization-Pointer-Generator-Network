Finally, after 22 minutes inside the Sun Life Stadium, the combination of Wayne Rooney and Daniel Sturridge crackled into life.

Sadly, after a lightning storm interrupted England’s final friendly before the World Cup, we only ever got to see flashes of the pairing’s potential.

On Saturday evening, when England face Italy in the opening group game of the World Cup in Manaus, it will have to come together.

Rooney was substituted at half-time on Saturday night, but the duo will still be paired against Italy.

Rooney and Sturridge haven’t played nearly enough football together and this was the last chance before the team flew overnight to their Rio de Janeiro training base.

Sturridge really should have scored when Danny Welbeck and Rooney broke through the Honduras defence midway through the first half.

The Liverpool striker, who turned neatly inside the penalty area, skewed his shot wide of the target.

Sturridge has scored four times for his country and will know that he could have easily added another. It will come and he doesn’t care who his partner is.

He’s in top form, flush full of confidence after scoring 21 goals for Liverpool in the Barclays Premier League.

There is a maturity about his game — he is a willing team player in Hodgson’s disciplined and organised 4-2-3-1 formation.

It feels as though he is England’s main goal threat — the most likely to change a game in the same way that Gary Lineker did in his country’s colours.

There were bursts from Rooney, too, after England’s head coach restored him to his favoured position for this final work-out.

The Manchester United striker is the only player to start all three friendlies ahead of the World Cup. He didn’t finish this one, however, and was replaced by the livewire Ross Barkley for the second period.

Next week, Rooney must turn it on in tournament football.

That was his promise in Portugal when he arrived in Vale do Lobo a full week ahead of schedule to make sure that he was in shape this summer.

He owes England at a World Cup, particularly after his subdued performances in 2006 and 2010. This is his chance.

It has been a difficult week for Hodgson to prepare his team, particularly after they were forced to abandon their training session at Barry University last Monday.

They were forced into a campus gym because of the hurricane season and on Saturday, with the score 0-0, the teams had to leave the field of play.

England were well aware of the risks when they booked their week-long stay in Miami and went ahead with the plan.

Hodgson remains convinced that his squad are ready for the challenges ahead when they arrive at base camp in Rio.

What they will need now is some positive forward thinking.
