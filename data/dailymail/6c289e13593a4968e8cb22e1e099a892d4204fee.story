Christie Brinkley's ex-husband Peter Cook has lashed out at the supermodel this week in an explosive court document countering claims he owes her child support.

The 58-year-old former Sports Illustrated cover girl quietly filed a motion to resolve claims Mr Cook owes $32,000 in expenses for their two children, including school tuition and summer camp fees.

But Mr Cook reignited their bitter custody dispute, claiming in a 91-page document at Suffolk County Supreme Court in New York that she in fact owes him money - calling her a 'narcissistic egomaniac'.

The architect, 53, claims he is owed 
$25,000 from Ms Brinkley for caring for their children while she 
performed in Chicago on New York’s Broadway and London's West End, 
reported the New York Post.

He also claims Ms Brinkley is dragging
 their two children into their disputes, claiming she has called him 
'truly narcissistic', and once wrote an e-mail to their son that Mr Cook
 'is jealous of my success'.

Neither party has yet commented. Ms 
Brinkley met Mr Cook in 1998 and had her third child, Sailor, with him. 
Mr Cook legally adopted her son with ex-husband Richard Taubman, Jack.

She also has a daughter, Alexa Ray, 
with first husband, singer Billy Joel. Ms Brinkley appeared in the video for his 1983 hit Uptown Girl but their marriage only lasted for nine years.

But  Ms Brinkley, who has been married four times, has been trading 
insults with Mr Cook ever since their acrimonious split in 2008.

Bitter divorce proceedings revealed Mr
 Cook spent thousands of dollars a month accessing internet porn. He was
 also romantically involved with a neighbour’s daughter, 
then-18-year-old Diana Bianchi.

During their 2008 divorce, the court was told that he had paid Ms Bianchi $300,000 in the hope of her keeping the liaison quiet.

Ms Brinkley meanwhile charged that Mr Cook was a bad father who used 'overwhelming' physical force when 
disciplining the children. The court psychiatrist said both parties needed therapy.

Blue-eyed and blonde-haired Ms Brinkley was born in Monroe, Michigan, but grew up in Malibu, California, before moving to Paris, France, for art school aged 18.

She then spent three years as an illustrator before being noticed by an American photographer - and then proceeded to appear on 200 magazine covers in the 1980s.

Ms Brinkley is most famous for appearing on three consecutive Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition covers from 1979 to 1981, and for her appearances in perfume and shampoo adverts.
