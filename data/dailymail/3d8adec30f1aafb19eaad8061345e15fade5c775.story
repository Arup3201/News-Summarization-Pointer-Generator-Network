Shocking allegations: Starla Rae McCabe, 45, from Perry, Utah, has been charged with 10 counts of sexual exploitation of a minor for allegedly selling naked pictures of her 5-year-old daughter 

A Utah mother has been arrested for allegedly taking pictures of her half-naked 5-year-old daughter and selling them to men.

Starla Rae McCabe, 45, from Perry, Utah, has been charged with 10 counts of sexual exploitation of a minor.

According to a probable cause statement obtained by Deseret News, police armed with a warrant searched a Nintendo DSi video game device featuring a camera and discovered a cache of 19 photo s depicting McCabe's 5-year-old daughter.

The child appeared naked from the waist down, with her genitals fully exposed, and some of the pictures also showed her face.

When interviewed by police last month, the toddler said that her mother would print out her X-rated pictures and sell them for $100 apiece.

During questioning, the 45-year-old woman admitted to taking the pornographic photos, but said she did it for educational purposes: to show her young daughter what her vagina looked like.

Officials were tipped off about McCabe's alleged side business last March when a relative discovered the nude photos on the handled Nintendo game.

McCabe, a Maine native living in Perry, has three biological children from past relationships - two sons and a daughter -  and two stepdaughters.

According to her Facebook profile, she works three jobs: as a sales person at a thrift shop, as a motel housekeeper and as a cashier at a dollar store.

Victim speaks: The girl, pictured here as a toddler with her face obscured, told police her mother printed photos showing her without her clothes on and sold them to people for $100 apiece

Her relationship status indicates that McCabe is engaged.

According to court records, the mother of three has a long history of run-ins with the law involving child endangerment, drug offenses and repeated probation violations.

In April of this year, she pleaded guilty to drug possession and attempted child endangerment.

The woman was placed on 36 months of probation requiring her to undergo treatment for drug addiction.

But when sheriff's officials arrived at her home with a search warrant, they discovered methamphetamine in the bathroom and inside a drawer in the living room within easy reach of a child.

Lawbreaker: The 45-year-old mother of three has a long history of run-ins with the law involving child endangerment, child abuse, meth-related offences and repeated probation violations

McCabe was found to be in violation of the conditions of her probation and sent to jail to await a court hearing.

In 2010, she pleaded guilty to attempted child endangerment and possession of drug paraphernalia but broke her probation.

A similar scenario played out four years earlier when she was found guilty of child abuse and sentenced to 36 months of probation, which she violated six months later.

Miss McCabe is due back in court for a preliminary hearing December 15.
