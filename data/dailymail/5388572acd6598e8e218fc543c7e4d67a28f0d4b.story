 1974 erotic tale directed by Frenchman Just Jaeckin, about the sexual 
adventures of a man and his beautiful young wife, played by Kristel, in 
Thailand.

She went on to star in four sequels and another six TV spin-offs, as well as in Hollywood movies including Private Lessons in 1981

Kristel
 also became famous for her steamy nude scenes in another 40 films, 
including lead roles in X-rated versions of Lady Chatterley's Lover and 
World War One spy drama Mata Hari.

Her career began as a 17-year-old 
model after brief stints as a secretary and a waitress, and she began to
 make a name for herself in 1973 when, aged 21, she won the Miss TV 
Europe contest.

The movie told the story of a bored housewife living with a diplomat in Asia who fills her time having sex with various people.

It was banned in Paris, where it was due to have its premier, for six months.

It was not released in the UK until it had been heavily edited - and even then only with an X rating. The full length version was not legally available in Britain until 2007.

Kristel told Dutch newspaper De 
Volkskrant, 'love dictated what I did', saying her former partner, 
Belgian author Hugo Claus, persuaded her to star in Emmanuelle.

'He said, "Thailand, that's nice, 
we've never been there and anyway the film will never come out in the 
Netherlands so you won't put your mother to shame,"' Kristel said. 'In 
the end, 350million people saw it worldwide..

Jaeckin, the director who is also a 
sculptor and has a gallery in Paris, said by telephone that he and 
Kristel maintained contact, calling each other every three to four 
months.

But he hadn't spoken with her since February.

He said: 'I am very sad... She was 
like a little sister. We started together. Emmanuelle brought us big 
problems. We were a bit marked.

'It was a highly contested film then and now it is a cult film.'

He said that he knew immediately that Kristel was destined for the leading role.

'When I saw her face, I was thunderstruck,' he said.

Kristel - a heavy smoker since the age of 11 - was treated for lung cancer ten years ago but managed to make a partial recovery.

In
 her 2006 autobiography Undressing Emmanuelle, she told of a personal 
life blighted by her battle with drugs and alcohol, and a series of 
destructive relationships with older men.

She lived in Los Angeles with Lovejoy star Ian McShane in the 1980s, who was ten years 
her senior.

They met on the set of the 1979 film 
The Fifth 
Musketeer. They moved in together after he promised 
to help her launch her American career but the couple split up after 
four years and she moved to St Tropez on the French Riviera.

Kristel
 described the relationship with McShane in her autobiography as 
'awful', adding: 'He was witty and charming but we were too much alike.'

Silver screen recognition did not come until May 2006 when Kristel received an award at
 the Tribeca Film Festival in New York for directing the animated short 
film Topor And Me.

She had 
been diagnosed with throat cancer five years earlier and underwent three
 courses of chemotherapy, as well as surgery, after it spread to her 
lungs.

She had one son Arthur with Belgian author Claus, 27 years her senior.

Kristel is survived by her partner Peter
 Brul and her son. She is to be buried at a 
private funeral. Further details were not released.
