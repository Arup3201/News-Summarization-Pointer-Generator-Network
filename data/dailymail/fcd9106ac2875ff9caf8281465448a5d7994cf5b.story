It is not easy to pull off a waltz with graze, or a tango with passion, but as far as dancing goes, these two polar bears are not doing it half-bad.

The polar pals showed off their moves as they turned the icy plains of Churchill, Canada into a ballroom.

Churchill, located on the west shore of Hudson Bay in Manitoba, Canada, is so famous for the large number of polar bears that it has earned the nickname Polar Bear Capital of the World.

The area has developed an entire tourist industry around polar bear sightseeing and for the population they are a part of daily life.

Residents of Churchill often leave their cars unlocked in case they need to make a quick escape from an approaching polar bear, and local police keep a 'polar bear jail' where animals who come too close to civilization are kept after being tranquilized, before it is safe to release them back into the wild.

Amateur photographer Alexey Tishchenko, from St. Petersburg, Russia saw the five-year-old bears playing in the snow and look like they are doing a ball room dance.

‘I love these photographs because it looks like the polar bears are dancing with each other.'

Alexey added: ‘I was watching them for a while, and they were just playing with each other.

‘But it took me by surprise when I noticed that they looked like they were dancing.'

‘I have always loved photography, ever since my grandmother gave me my first camera and from that moment I have always had a camera in my hand - I started taking pictures of the beautiful nature and wild animals.

‘I try to take photographs that compare the two worlds of human and animal, then find similarities between them.’
