The African-American actor who claims he was detained and questioned because of racial profiling while shopping at the flagship Manhattan branch of Macy’s has filed class action lawsuits against the department store and the NYPD.

Rob Brown, who stars in the HBO series Treme and has appeared in movies including Finding Forrest, was detained for 45 minutes on June 8 after buying a $1,300 watch for his mother.

In a 42-page federal lawsuit filed on Wednesday, Brown charges that Macy's security ‘policies and practices have left... customers of color feeling victimized, humiliated, traumatized.’

In a second federal lawsuit against 
the NYPD, he leveled similar charges in a New York class action over the
alleged ‘shop and frisk’ approach taken by cops against minority 
customers.

The NYPD is 
‘continuing to enforce, encourage and sanction policies’ against 
customers at high-end retail stores ‘merely because of the color of 
their skin,’ the 31-page suit charged.

Brown
had earlier filed a state lawsuit  against both Macy's and the NYPD, 
but those suits were dropped on Tuesday in anticipation of the class 
action, reports the Daily News.

The suit against Macy's cited legal action brought by 14 other minority members based on incidents at other branches.

‘The
specific, racially motivated abuses … constitute an on-going pattern 
and practice that has occurred and is continuing to occur in Macy's 
stores throughout the United States,’ the court papers alleged.

‘The
disturbing truth is that Mr. Brown's harrowing ordeal was not an 
isolated event at Macy's, but is just one example of Macy's relentless 
and unlawful pattern and practice of ... disproportionately targeting 
its shoppers of color.’

Macy's
has emphatically denied racially profiling Brown, and insisted they 
were not involved in either the detention or questioning of Brown.

The
actor said that he was accused of using a fake credit card to buy his 
mom a $1,300 silver Movado watch with gold trim on June 8.

The Brooklyn-raised Brown said three white, plainclothes NYPD detectives quickly descended upon him.

According to his earlier lawsuit, one of the cops told Brown that "he could not afford to make such an expensive purchase."

Brown's account followed claims from two black shoppers who said they were racially profiled at Barneys New York.

Trayon
Christian sued Barneys, saying he was accused of fraud after using his 
debit card to buy a $349 Ferragamo belt in April.

Kayla Philips filed a 
notice of claim saying she would sue after she was stopped by detectives
outside the store when she bought a $2,500 Celine handbag in February.
