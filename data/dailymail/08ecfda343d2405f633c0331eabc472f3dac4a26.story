Eden Hazard has eased Chelsea fears that he is unhappy at Stamford Bridge with a vow to improve next season and help the club become champions of Europe once again.

The Belgian winger also admitted that manager Jose Mourinho had been right to drive him hard and demand more from him. 'It’s true and it’s good,' said Hazard. 'I prefer it when we speak like this, rather than saying things like: "He’s the best and he doesn’t need to work".'

Hazard, Chelsea’s 17-goal top scorer, was voted PFA Young Player of the Year but tired towards the end of the season. His last four goals were all from the penalty spot and he has not scored from open play since early February.

His failure to track back and defend was also criticised in the Champions League semi-final defeat against Atletico Madrid, prompting Mourinho to say the 23-year-old was not ready to 'sacrifice' himself for the team.

'I know maybe I have to do better in training or on the pitch,' said Hazard, in an interview with the Chelsea magazine. 'I want to score more and help the team score more goals and next season I hope we can be better.

'I try to play like I did when I was a young boy playing in my garden. Sometimes it’s good, sometimes it’s not so good but I try to always make sure I give my best to help the team, even if I am not having the best game myself.

'When you are young, you sometimes play one good game and then one bad game. This season I was able to be more consistent which is good for me.'

Chelsea reached the last four of the Champions League and finished third in the Barclays Premier League, four points behind champions Manchester City, and Mourinho knows Hazard has the speed and talent to propel this team to a higher level.

'This season we didn’t win any trophies but we were back in the Champions League,' said the Belgian. 'For a young player like me it is good to play for a club that can get to the semi-finals, because one of the reasons I play football is for these big games.

'This season was an ‘almost’ season – almost getting to the Champions League final, almost champions in the Premier League. Next season, with this team, we can win the Premier League and maybe the Champions League.

'Individually I am very happy because I can play in every game, I can be on the pitch and do what I like to do, which is play football. It was a good season for me but, as the boss says, we finished third and I hope next season we finish first. I always want to score more goals and improve, that is a big objective.'
