Out-of-hours GPs are being left to care on their own for up to half a million patients.

Cost-cutting NHS chiefs are routinely assigning just one family doctor to districts that stretch over hundreds of square miles.

A third of primary care trusts, which manage GP services, have slashed night and weekend spending over the past 12 months.

In Cornwall, some nights have seen one GP looking after 535,000 patients. In Mid Essex just one doctor is in charge of 370,000 between 7pm and 8am.

And after axing one of its two doctors, North East Essex has the same cover for the 325,000 patients on its books.

Stuart Gray, a GP whose father was killed in 2008 by an incompetent locum doctor, said: ‘I am appalled but not surprised.

‘It would appear some trusts really don’t care about patient safety or put it high on their agenda. I fear many PCT managers are driven by their desire to balance the books. This is morally repugnant.

‘Patients are still put at unacceptable risk by apparently negligent practices.’

The standard of out-of-hours care has been under scrutiny since 2004 when a new contract enabled GPs to opt out of evening and weekend duties. Now only one in four works out of hours.

Many trusts have since outsourced the cover to private firms who hire locum – or temporary – doctors to fill the shifts.

Trusts have been found to be employing doctors from overseas without checking they have the necessary skills or can even speak English.

In 2008, Dr Gray’s pensioner father David, from Cambridgeshire, died after a German doctor, Daniel Ubani, gave him ten times the recommended dose of a painkiller.

It later emerged Ubani had been hired by Take Care Now, a private firm which had not carried out any checks on him.

Using the Freedom of Information Act, the Mail asked every PCT in England a series of questions about out-of-hours cover.

Of the 90 that responded, 35 had slashed their out-of-hours budgets in the past year. The average cut was 10 per cent.

And 11 trusts employed only one doctor at night to cover between 180,000 and 535,000 patients.

Katherine Murphy, chief executive of The Patients Association, said: ‘These stark figures confirm what patients are telling us - it is incredibly difficult to get access to a GP out of hours either to talk by phone or to arrange a home visit.’

A spokesman from Serco, the private firm which runs out-of-hours cover in Cornwall, said there had been a ‘limited’ number of occasions in the past year when just one GP was on call.

He said Serco now ensured there were at least two GPs on call at night to cover all of the county’s 1,316 square miles. In addition at least five nurses and paramedics are on duty in cars.

Surgeries should provide a separate out-of-hours number and patients can also call NHS Direct. GPs now have to provide care between 8am and 6.30pm only.

Usually locums are based at an out-of-hours clinic for the duration of the night and will only make a handful of home visits to more serious cases.

A Department of Health spokesman said local NHS groups were obliged to ensure high quality care was in place and should take action over any failings.
