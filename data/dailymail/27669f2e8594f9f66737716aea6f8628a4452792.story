A woman who fell 1,000ft to her death during a freak hang gliding accent wasn't strapped into the glider when she took off with her instructor, an investigation has revealed.

The pilot of 27-year-old Lenami Godinez-Avila was found distracted prior to their jump in British Colombia, Canada and consequently failed to perform a hang glider check prior to her death last spring, according to investigators.

'[T]he investigation assumes that pilot distraction resulted in a failure to perform recommended standardized safety procedures, resulting in the death of the passenger,' Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association of Canada (HPAC) Investigator Martin Henry told the Calgary Herald.

Victim: Lenami Godinez-Avila, 27, died in April after a freak hang gliding accident investigators say resulted from her pilot failing to strap her in

Charged: Hang glider pilot Jon Orders, since released on bail, faces a charge of attempted obstruction after swallowing a video card capturing the trip which police have since obtained

It was approximately 30 seconds after Ms Godinez-Avila and pilot William Jonathan Orders, 50, took off near Agassiz on April 28 that she fell.

It was to be her first hang gliding experience with her boyfriend who witnessed her fall while desperately calling out to her: 'Hang on! I love you!'

Her boyfriend David, whom she was celebrating an anniversary with, was riding with a separate pilot when it happened.

'A review of the events leading up to take-off suggests that there were multiple distractions that may have resulted in a breakdown of standard operating procedures,' the HPAC report read.

Scene: Hang gliders and emergency workers rush to where Lenami Godinez-Avila's body was found after she plummeted 1,000 feet to her death in what was her first hang gliding experience

Tragic end: The 27-year-old was able to hang on for just 30 seconds before losing her grip and falling

None of the seven witnesses interviewed saw her undergo a hang check.

Nicole McLearn who was there the day Lenami died said the couple were 'joyous' as they watched the other hang gliders take to the air, growing excited about their turn.

She told the Post Media News that as soon as she and instructor William Jonathan Orders became airbound, it was clear something was wrong.

She said: 'I could see her starting to slip down his body ... past the waist, down
the legs. Finally she got to the feet and tried to hang on and 
obviously couldn't hang on for that much longer and let go, tearing off 
the tandem pilot's shoes in the process.'

Distracted: Police investigating the death of Lenami, left, say the pilot, right, was distracted before their flight, causing him to miss administrating all safety procedures

Usually an instructor and the student
should be side by side, but Lenami was below him and it became obvious 
she was not hooked in.

Miss McLearn said it
appeared that Godinez-Avilaâ€™s feet were dangling, meaning she was 
relying on her upper body to hold on and the instructor was trying to 
wrap his legs around her torso.

She was only in the air about 30 seconds before she died.

At the launch site, her boyfriend watched what was happening and screamed as she fell: 'No! Lenami! Hang on! I love you!'

Orders was held in custody following an admittance to police that he swallowed a video card which may have recorded events leading up to the incident.

Swallowed: A flash drive, similar to the one pulled out of one of the pilot's cameras is seen, left, in comparison to older cameras' much larger sizes, right

Witness: Nicole McLearn said it became obvious as soon as they took off that something was not right as the instructor was horizontal and Lenami was hanging vertical

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said they have since obtained the card, described as no bigger than a finger nail in size, but wouldn't comment on the evidence collected from it.

They also said they seized video taken by the boyfriend on the ground.

Orders was granted bail when he appeared in a provincial court in Chilliwack, British Columbia in May. A trial is set for April of 2013 on a charge of attempted obstruction.

Orders is a fully certified hang-gliding pilot and instructor with 16 years' experience.

His
business website, Vancouver Hang Gliding, states that photos and video 
are available when people purchase a tandem hang-gliding trip.

Search for clues: Police examined the hang-glider after the body of Miss Godinez-Avila was found

Investigation: Police say they have reviewed the footage stored on the video card ingested by the pilot but have yet to release comment on their findings

The young woman's body was found in a forest clear cut below Mount Woodside, a popular spot for hang gliders to launch from above British Columbia's Fraser Valley.

Jason Warner, safety officer for the Hang Gliders and Paragliders Association of Canada, said that he spoke to Orders minutes after Godinez-Avila fell from the glider.

Accused: Orders, a fully certified hang-gliding pilot and instructor had 16 years' experience

Mr Warner said Orders told him he knew something was wrong almost immediately and tried desperately to hang on to the woman, who clung to his body and then slipped down his legs, taking one of Orders' shoes with her.

Miss Godinez-Avila, who was an 
administrator at the provincial Ministry of Environment, went hang 
gliding after her boyfriend bought her lessons for their anniversary.

He was video-recording the flight, but had stopped taping before she fell.

Friends of Miss Godinez-Avila have set up a memorial fund and scholarship to remember her.

One friend, Katherine Louman-Gardiner, told CTV News: 'She was a bright and caring, charismatic person and we miss her terribly.

'She loved contributing to the community around her.'

Miss Godinez-Avila's former professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada, Anil Hira, paid tribute to her.

'She was just starting out, she was extremely successful, someone who walks on air, very light-hearted but extremely capable.

'It's the last person you would want to see this happen to.'

The woman's death marks the second high-profile fatality related to hang gliding in recent months.

In October, 16-year-old Lois Preston, described as an experienced pilot, died from injuries sustained when her glider crashed in Ashbourne in England.
