Baby Ringo is bottle-fed every eight hours, cries for his mum and needs to be cuddled to sleep in the middle of the night.

And while he lives in a house in North Ryde, Sydney and snuggles in bed with his 'parents' every morning, the 10-month-old isn't a human. He's a wombat.

Ringo's mother was killed by a car and so for the past three weeks the tiny marsupial has been living with WILD LIFE Sydney Zoo keeper Erin Costelloe.

He's catching up on the news! Ringo has made a name for himself acting like people

Baby wombats have very long care periods with their mothers – usually 12-18 months – and at his age it would be too distressing for Ringo to stay in the zoo overnight

Baby wombats have very long care periods with their mothers – usually 12-18 months – and at his age it would be too distressing for Ringo to stay in the zoo overnight.

So for the next two months he will be staying with the 25-year-old, who lives in a share house with her partner and three other housemates.

'He wakes up and he calls for me,' Ms Costelloe told MailOnline.

'They make these weird noises, it's like a "tss tss" and I give him cuddle.

'Basically he just needs to know that mum's there.'

He spends his days at the zoo in the exhibit but he needs to be monitored by a keeper at all times.

'He comes basically everywhere I go,' she said.

 When Ringo is 12 months old he will undergo a 'soft release' in order to familiarise him the zoo at night

Ms Costelloe said taking care of Ringo was very tiring, but also very rewarding.

'I've got a puppy that's 11 months old, and when I get up at 3am and have to give Ringo a cuddle the puppy's jumping around like a toddler and he's sooking like baby.

'It's reminded me I don't want to have kids for a long time.'

Ms Costelloe said her housemates are 'very tolerant and accepting' and they have agreed to let her use a second bathroom in the house as a temporary wombat enclosure.

Her housemates also babysit Ringo if she has to go out at night.

Her partner Alvin, who she shares a room with, lets Ringo cuddle in bed every morning as Ms Costelloe dresses for work.

'I retrieve him and give him to my partner and he just keeps on sleeping and lets the wombat hang out on the bed while I get ready,' she said.

The tiny marsupial has become good friends with the zookeeper's dog Elke and they often play together

Ringo has also become good friends with Ms Costelloe's dog Elke, and they often play outside together or lie next to each other in Elke's dog bed.

When Ringo is 12 months old he will undergo a 'soft release' in order to familiarise him with staying at the zoo overnight.

'We will start him staying over one night a week, then back to my place, so it's not too much of a drastic change.'

Ringo was rescued from his mother's pouch after she was hit by a car and killed on the side of the road in Nowra on the South Coast of NSW.

'This happens to a lot of wombats, a lot of wombats dies in this way,' Ms Costelloe said.

'We are trying to get the message out to people that if they see a dead wombat on the side of the road, if it's a female there's a good chance there's a young in the pouch.

Ringo made his debut at WILD LIFE Sydney Zoo on Thursday and will become a feature of the Outback Adventure Show

'They may end up starving to death but they can live up to two days.'

When Ringo was rescued he weighed just 950 grams. He currently weighs about 6.5kg but could grow to be up to 30kg.

Ringo made his public debut on Thursday, and he will be a regular feature in the Outback Adventure Show.

Ms Costelloe said adding Ringo to the show would help raise awareness for the critically endangered northern hairy-nosed wombat.

'There are fewer than 200 individuals left in the world, it's possible that they'll go instinct in our lifetime,' she said.

'While Ringo is what we call a common wombat he's an ambassador for all wombats, it's important for him to come out in the shows.'

How could you say no to this face? Ringo has become a huge hit with the public and is considered by the zoo to be a wombat ambassador'
