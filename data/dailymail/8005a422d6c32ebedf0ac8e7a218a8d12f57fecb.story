Luckless Lewis Hamilton's bid for a fifth pole position in Hungary literally went up in flames as his car caught fire early in qualifying.

Just minutes into the session at the Hungaroring, Hamilton's Mercedes was ablaze at the rear, and although he attempted to crawl back to the garage, it proved a futile exercise.

Hamilton was forced to stop on the pit lane entry road where marshals quickly used extinguishers to douse the fire, started by what Mercedes claimed to be a fuel leak.

Inferno: Hamilton's Mercedes caught fire as he was driving around the Hungaroring in Q1

Rush: Hamilton managed to drive around the track and make it to the pit lane before he jumped out of the car

Cloud: Smoke billowed out of the engine as a fuel leak caused Hamilton's Mercedes to catch fire

State: Hamilton's Mercedes was badly damaged by the fire as it spread around the rear end of the car

21. Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes)

As the Briton looked on, and even 
though the visor was down on his helmet, you could sense his bitter pain
 and disappointment as he shook his head disconsolately before trudging 
away.

It was yet another 
brutal blow for Hamilton in his bid to overhaul Mercedes team-mate Nico 
Rosberg in this year's battle for the Formula One world title.

To
 rub salt into Hamilton's wounds, Rosberg secured his third consecutive 
pole position and will start Sunday's race ahead of Sebastian Vettel in 
his Red Bull and the Williams of Valtteri Bottas.

In
 the build up to this race Hamilton had spoken of his desire to enjoy a 
clean weekend without his errors on one hand, and unreliability on the 
other.

But the 29-year-old must now feel like this may not be his year given the run of wretched luck he has endured this campaign.

Flames: Hamilton drives around a corner of the Hungaroring with his engine on fire during Q1

Frustration: Hamilton has now gone six race without a pole position after his withdrawal in Q1

In
 a season when Mercedes are dominant, and when their cars do finish a 
race they are either first or second, Hamilton has so far suffered two 
DNFs (did not finish) to the one for Rosberg.

That has played a key role in the 14-point gap between the pair ahead of Sunday's race.

A
 forlorn Hamilton, who had been quickest through all three practice 
sessions, said: 'I bailed out of that timed lap I was doing and I was 
like "I'm going to try and do the second lap".

'Then
 something happened to my brakes. Something on the brake system failed, 
so I had to engage some settings to try and correct it, then the engines
 died.

I then thought "I am 
right next to the pit entry so I will roll back and get them to fix it" 
but then I looked in my mirrors and it was on fire.

'I was hoping to get it in neutral so I could push it back or something.

Re-live today's dramatic qualifying session with Phil Duncan

'I
 was still trying to get it to the garage and maybe they could do 
something, but they said 'stop, stop, stop' so I tried to stop, but the 
brakes weren't working. The car kept running forward.

'The engine was working sometimes and sometimes not working, so it is all pretty bad.

'I think it's getting to the point beyond bad luck - it's something else. We just need to do better.'As for his hopes for the race, Hamilton added: 'We'll have to replace the engine and gearbox (which incur penalties).

'But with those it's a good thing - I can't go any further back (on the grid).

'There's a lot going through my mind, but I just have to try to turn it into positives.

'I
 honestly don't know what I can do tomorrow. This is a track where you 
cannot overtake, so I think I will struggle to get in the top 10 or at 
least the top five.

Helpless: Hamilton can only lean over his Mercedes as he watches race stewards attempt to put out the fire

'I will 
probably leave here more than 20 points behind Nico, but there are still
 races to go. I don't know what to say, I will try my best.'

The
 remainder of the session was naturally nowhere near as dramatic, but 
was nevertheless eventful, particularly when rain began to fall at the 
start of the top-10 shoot-out.

As
 the drivers attempted to get in a flying lap on slick rubber, the 
slippery surface proved too difficult to handle, especially for Kevin 
Magnussen who slid off into a tyre barrier at turn one.

That
 brought out the red flags for his car to be recovered and for the 
barrier to be repaired, resulting in an eight-minute delay.

That
 period of time was enough for the rain to pass and the track to start 
to dry out, ensuring the remaining nine drivers could again use slick 
tyres.

Come the conclusion it came as no surprise when Rosberg clinched pole, his sixth of the year and fifth in the last six races.

Rosberg finished half a second clear of Vettel, on the front row for the third time this year.

Bottas lines up third, followed by Daniel Ricciardo in his Red Bull and Fernando Alonso in his Ferrari.

Williams'
 Felipe Massa starts sixth, with Jenson Button seventh for McLaren ahead
 of Toro Rosso's Jean-Eric Vergne and Nico Hulkenberg for Force India, 
with Magnussen 10th.

Daniil 
Kvyat starts 11th in his Toro Rosso, although a spin on his final hot 
lap in Q2 denied him the possibility of a place in the top 10.

Poor: Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen was knocked out of qualifying in Q1 for the second week in a row

Sauber
 pair Adrian Sutil and Esteban Gutierrez qualified 12th and 14th, with 
Force India's Sergio Perez sandwiched in the middle.

Lotus' Romain Grosjean is 15th, with Jules Bianchi 16th for Marussia as Hamilton's fire was not the only surprise in Q1.

Ferrari misjudged matters that resulted in Bianchi dropping Kimi Raikkonen down to 17th and out of the session.

Behind
 the Finn will be Caterham pair Kamui Kobayashi and Marcus Ericsson in 
18th and 20th, either side of Marussia's Max Chilton.

Hamilton
 was placed 21st as Lotus' Pastor Maldonado retired with a technical 
fault on his Lotus just a couple of minutes beforehand.

Neither
 driver set a time, but both will naturally be allowed to compete, with 
the penalties for Hamilton meaning the pit lane start, allowing 
Maldonado to jump up to 21st.
