Dangerous criminals in top-security jails are being allowed to cook their own food as a reward for good behaviour, it has emerged.

Offenders can purchase food from an approved list with their own money and are then allowed to prepare it to their liking in the prison kitchens.

The self-catering scheme has been rolled out across many low-security jails to help inmates cope when they are released but sources claim the option is also being offered to dangerous offenders.

Even inmates at high security jails, such as Full Sutton in Yorkshire where murderer Jeremy Bamber is serving his sentence and Long Lartin in Worcestershire where preacher Abu Hamza  was held, are being offered the perk.

A source told The Times: 'This is about providing an extra range of food for the most dangerous and more difficult prisoners - the ones the public would like the least.'

Prisoners, who have to use money from their own allowance which can very between £4 and £25 a week, can purchase a 1.4kg frozen chicken for £3.69 or 370g of pork chops for £1.99, the newspaper reports.

At Full Sutton prison, around a quarter of the 600 inmates are on the self-catering scheme with many more wanting to join.

Other prisons to run the scheme include Frankland and Low Newton in County Durham and Gartree in Leicestershire.

The revelation is likely to provoke questions for Justice Secretary Chris Grayling who has promised a tough stance on crime.

A Prison Service spokeswoman said the self-catering scheme offered offenders a 'productive way to spend their time' while helping those due to be released to prepare for an 'independent life after prison'.

They added that the scheme is also an incentive for prisoners to show good behaviour as the privilege is removed from any prisoner who does not comply with the prison regime.

A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: 'We are introducing a tough new regime in our prisons, and we are serious about enforcing it.

'There are a small number of kitchen facilities that provide prisoners serving long sentences with a productive way to spend their time and assist in their rehabilitation by preparing them for an independent life after prison.

'Prisoners are only able to use kitchens if they have earned the right to do so through good behaviour, they must order items from a controlled list and pay for them from their own earnings. In the high security prisons only plastic knives are available.'

But
a little over a month ago, prisoners at HMP Long Lartin revealed that 
Islamic extremists held at the jail threatened to stab anyone who tried 
to cook pork in the communal kitchens.

In
a letter to prisoners' magazine Inside Time, one inmate claimed it was 
'deemed dangerous, even a threat to your life' if you attempted to cook 
the meat.

'Terror' preacher Abu Hamza and radical cleric Abu Qatada have both been held at the prison

The
inmate wrote: 'The kitchen is usually occupied by 90 per cent Muslims 
and we have been told if we cook pork we will be stabbed. There have 
been incidents here where people have been targeted and pressured and 
bullied into converting to Islam.

'Young Muslim men are being radicalised in here and one day they may commit acts of terrorism in this country.

'There seems to be nothing being done here to stop it and people are scared to speak out.'

Those
prisoners who are not allowed to use the self-catering option have to 
pick their meals from a menu which includes a vegetarian option. 

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, pictured on a visit to Pentonville Prison in London earlier this year, is likely to face questions over the scheme after vowing to take a tough stance on crime
