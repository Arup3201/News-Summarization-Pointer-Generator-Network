A 15-year-old girl who was unmasked as a 34-year-old suspected con artist this week not only managed to deceive her guardian and Texas school officials, but also her 23-year-old boyfriend, it was revealed Friday.

Charity Johnson was arrested in Longview Monday - seven months after she enrolled in a local high school as a sophomore after pretending to be an orphan.

The bizarre tale of deception has left many people in the small East Texas community in a state of disbelief, including Rickie Williams, who has been dating Johnson since last summer.

‘My best friend showed me and I was shocked,' the 23-year-old movie theater attendant told KLTV.

Williams said Johnson, who has been using the last name Stevens, told him she was 18 years old.

Johnson also managed to pull the wool over the eyes of Roshunda Floyd, who met the 34-year-old at work.

Floyd, who works at Walmart in Longview, recalled that one night Johnson approached her asking for help choosing an outfit for a family reunion.

The Walmart employee asked Johnson how old she was, and the 34-year-old allegedly replied that she was 'just a sophomore in high school,.'

'"Really?” I said, “You seem to be a little older than that.” She didn't say anything,’ Floyd recalled the exchange.

Another person who bought into Johnson's sad tale of abuse and loss was Osarieme Obaseki, 40, who runs the Dallas-based What About Us non-profit organization helping women and girls.

Obaseki told ABC News that Johnson first contacted her last month claiming to be a 14-year-old girl in need of help.

The two formed a bond and continued exchanging phone calls, with Johnson calling the woman only six years her senior 'Mom.'  She was living with her guardian, Tamica Lincoln, in Longview at the time, but made no mention of that to Obaseki.

Their relationship culminated on Mother's Day when Johnson took a train to Dallas to visit Obaseki, even bringing her a homemade holiday card.

But over the course of Johnson’s visit, Obaseki's sister became suspicious, pointing out to her that the high school sophomore had the body of a grown woman.

Sensing that something did not add up, Obaseki called Lincoln – a phone call that set in motion a chain of events which eventually led to Johnson being exposed as a fraud.

‘It’s just been a lot of lies and cover-up,’ Obaseki said. ‘Nobody I spoke to has said it’s ever been a financial situation. She had money! It’s not that, at all.’

Charity Johnson, was arrested Monday night- more than six months after she enrolled in New Life Christian School in Longview pretending to be a 15-year-old orphan.

According to school officials, Ms Johnson came to New Life last October accompanied by a guardian who turned out to be younger than the fake tenth-grader.

During the enrollment process, Johnson gave the name Charity Stevens and indicated that she was 15 years old.

Tamica Lincoln, 30, who took on the role of Johnson's guardian last March, told the station KLTV the bogus teenager told her that she had been abused by her biological father, who has since died along with her mother.

The two women met while working together at a McDonald's located inside the local Walmart, and Johnson confided in Lincoln that she had no place to stay after losing her parents. 

Lincoln brought the suspected con artist four years her senior into her home 'as a child,' bought her clothes and did her hair. She even attended parent-teacher conferences to talk about the fake sophomore’s impressive academic performance. 

'She acted like a kid. She did her homework. She got good report cards,' the 30-year-old Longview resident told ABC News.

Johnson’s web of lies began unraveling when Lincoln got a call from Obaseki, the head of the Dallas-based charity.

Ugly truth: Her work file indicted that Johnson was born in 1979 and that her last name was not Stevens

Ms Obaseki told Lincoln that she ran a background check on 'Charity Stevens,' which provided more questions than answers. 

Lincoln
 then decided to make inquires of her own and called a manager at the 
McDonald's where both she and Johnson worked. The staffer pulled up the 
high schooler's file, which indicated that her birth year was 1979 and 
her real name Charity Johnson.

On Tuesday, Lincoln and the phony orphan’s mentor, Ray Ward, alerted 
police to the alleged fraud before heading over to the high school. 

‘Teachers were crying and students were crying, and her best friend just couldn't believe it,’ Lincoln said.

School officials said Johnson came in last October as a home-schooled student without any prior transcripts.

Officers who responded to Lincoln’s Longview home Monday night asked Johnson to identify herself, and in response she gave them the name Charity Stevens – the same moniker used on her school application. 

Sticking to her ruse: Hours before her arrest Monday night, Johnson posted this photo of her posing with a horse stature under the Instagram user name Charite Love

Sob story: Ms Johnson told Lincoln, her co-worker at a McDonald's who is four years her senior, that she had lost both her parents and had no place to live

Online persona: On Facebook and Twitter, Johnson called herself 'Charite' and shared photos of herself looking like a teenager

The woman has been charged with failure to identify/giving false, fictitious information. She remains in the Gregg County Jail on $500 bond.

Looking at Johnson’s fake Facebook,Twitter and Instagram account created under the nickname Charite, it is easy to understand how those around her could have bought in to her tale of woes.

In the photos posted online, Johnson looks like a shy, fresh-faced girl with a pink bow in her neatly combed hair and sparkly manicure.

However, in her booking photo, Johnson dressed in a striped jail garb looks not a day younger than her 34 years, with a lined, puffy face and a tangle of hair.
