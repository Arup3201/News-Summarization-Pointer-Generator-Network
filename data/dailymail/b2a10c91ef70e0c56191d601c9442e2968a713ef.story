The St Rose of Lima church in Connecticut was evacuated today during a noon mass after the church received a bomb threat - in another traumatic day for a community rocked by tragedy.

Following
 the horrific tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown on Friday, tensions were raised again at the sight of 
nearly a dozen camouflage-clad SWAT team members carrying assault 
weapons who rushed into the church and a nearby educational center.

The Catholic church that has become a center of grieving since the deaths of 20 children and six adults at the nearby Sandy Hook Elementary School.

'As a nation, we have endured far too many of these tragedies in the last few years,' he said in his weekly radio address Saturday.

'An elementary school in Newtown. A shopping mall in Oregon. A house of worship in Wisconsin. A movie theater in Colorado. Countless street corners in places like Chicago and Philadelphia... 'We have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this. Regardless of the politics,' Obama said in his broadcast remarks.'

The church has been a source of solace for many in the small town still coming to grips with Friday's tragedy.
