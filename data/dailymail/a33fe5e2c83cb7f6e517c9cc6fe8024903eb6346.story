Suspect: Police say Kurt Myers, 64, fatally shot four people yesterday

A suspect accused of fatally shooting four people and injuring two more in upstate New York on Wednesday was killed after a 19-hour standoff with law enforcement.

Officers stormed the abandoned bar in downtown Herkimer where the suspect, 64-year-old Kurt Myers, was holed up after Myers opened fire on a canine unit, killing an FBI dog, around 8 a.m. on Thursday.

'This morning, law enforcement officials entered the building and, after being fired upon, shot and killed the suspect, Kurt Myers,' New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a statement Thursday. 'There were no injuries to local law enforcement officials, though an FBI police dog was fatally shot.'

Myers' killing rampage had started early Wednesday after he allegedly ignited a fire in his apartment in the nearby village of Mohawk, which is about 80 miles northeast of Albany.

Myers then drove to John's Barber Shop around the corner and used a shotgun to kill two customers, who were identified as Harry Montgomery, 68, and Michael Ransear, 57, a retired corrections officer.

The shop's owner, John Seymour, and another customer, Dan Haslauer, were listed in critical condition at a Utica hospital.

Police Superintendent Joseph D'Amico said the gunman then drove to 
Gaffy's Fast Lube in nearby Herkimer and used the shotgun to kill Thomas
Stefka, an employee, and Michael Renshaw, a customer who was a 23-year 
veteran of the state Department of Corrections.

John Seymour, the barber shop owner, told his sister, Mary Hornett, that the attack came out of nowhere.

‘He just said that the guys were in the 
barbershop and this guy comes in and he says, "Hi John, do you remember 
me?" and my brother said, "Yes, Kurt, how are you?" and then he just 
started shooting,’ Hornett said.

Hornett said her brother, who was 
hospitalized in critical condition, was doing well after being shot in 
the left hand and right hip.

‘My brother couldn't think of any reason why he would do such a thing,’ 
she said of Myers, a former customer who hadn't been in the shop for a 
couple of years.

Cuomo called the shooting spree ‘truly an inexplicable situation.’

‘There's no apparent motive to the best of our knowledge at this time to provoke these attacks,’ he said.

D'Amico said police had not had any communication with Myers, whose only known police record was a 1973 drunken-driving arrest.

Police positioned in front of a block
of small businesses topped with apartments in the village of Herkimer 
were still looking for Myers Wednesday afternoon.

A local businessman, jeweler Fred 
Weisser, said police had evacuated people while Myers was 
believed to be in a building next door.

‘They're sending in a robot to check 
the place out,’ he said by telephone. ‘I guess we're stuck. We're 
between him and the cops. I don't want to step out and get clipped by a 
sniper.’

Myles Smith, who lives in one of the apartments above the shops, said by cellphone he had heard police trying to talk to Myers.

‘The snipers on the roof are sitting 
there,’ Smith said. ‘I ain't seen a whole lot of movement. I heard about
five gunshots. I keep hearing them trying to talk him out, but I don't 
think he's coming out.’

The rear of the small building at 32 South Washington St.  in Mohawk where
Myers lived was burned out, and police continued to guard the building,
where they found guns and ammunition. It was unclear if they were in 
his apartment.

Neighbors said they barely knew Myers, who rarely spoke, and left every morning in his red Jeep.

Traci Randall said the only time she 
remembers speaking to her next-door neighbor was when he yelled at her 
son because he thought he had shot an air pellet at his Jeep.

‘He was a great guy, a really nice person. This is horrific. We really couldn't believe it,’ she said.

Herkimer County Community College 
lifted a lockdown during the afternoon, and all but a few schools near 
the scene also were releasing students. D'Amico said most of the 
three-block neighborhood around the search scene was evacuated.

‘He would walk by himself. He was kind of a loner. No wife,’ she said.

Neighbors said he never had visitors 
or friends. Gary Urich said Myers wouldn't even say much as `Hi' to him 
when walking by his porch.

‘I said, "How are you doing?'"No response. He just walked by,’ he said.

Michele Mlinar, a bartender at 
Cangee's Bar and Grille in Herkimer, said Myers frequently went in and 
had a bottle or two of Coors Light and left without speaking to anyone. 
She said he was always alone and she didn't even know his name until 
police released his mug shot on Wednesday. Cangee's owner Candy Rellin called Myers ‘just an odd little man.’

The two villages are about 65 miles 
east of Syracuse, on opposite sides of the Mohawk River in a region 
known as the Mohawk Valley.

James Baron, the mayor of Mohawk 
described his village as close-knit and friendly, ‘the kind of place 
where you'd say, "Oh, it would never happen here."'

Elizabeth Cirelli was shocked by Stefka's slaying. He was a neighbor in Herkimer.

Officers raided Myers' apartment and found half a dozen guns and ammunition, according to the Utica Observer-Dispatch.

The newspaper also reported that the gunman may have worked at the car wash where two people were killed.

'We saw a 
gunman walking around the shop,' one woman who was at the car wash told 
WKTV. She said she saw two people who were shot on the 
ground.

'Then he took off in a Jeep Wrangler,' she said of the shooter, adding, 'There were empty rifle shells on the ground.'

Harry Montgomery Sr. of Mohawk was among the victims who were shot and killed at John’s Barber Shop.

Montgomery, 68, was visiting the shop for a haircut, according to his son.

'My sister was
at the bank, cashing a check when she heard all the commotion,' 
Montgomery told the Observer-Dispatch. 'She came out to see what was 
going on and found out it was Dad who got shot.'

Myers is described as about 5-foot-11 with white hair and a white beard. He was last seen wearing a flannel shirt

Michele Mlinar, who works as a bartender at Cangees Bar and Grill in Herkimer, said Myers had been a regular customer of hers for about 10 years.

'When I saw his picture, I just got sick to my stomach,' she told the Observer-Dispatch. 'It could have been here. It could have been us.'

She said he wasn't a 'people person' and 'he would never talk to anyone else' when he visited the bar. He would usually visit the bar on Fridays and Saturdays and drink two Coors and listen to live music, she added.

She also noted that he was kind to the staff, but seemed 'very jittery and nervous.'
