The groom wore a scarf and fez, the bride donned a black lace dress - but the best man looked out of this world. 

When Paul and Joanne Seymour from Gravesend, Kent, decided to renew their vows after 30 years of marriage, they shunned the traditional ceremony and opted instead for a Doctor Who theme - with a Dalek as the best man.

The service at the St Peter and St Paul's Church began with the couple, who had a white wedding at the same church in 1984, walking down the aisle to the show's theme music.

From another universe: The Dalek bursts through the doors of St Peter and St Paul's Church in Gravesend, Kent, before Paul, 55, and Joanne Seymour, 52, renew their marriage vows 

Kiss of death: The couple, who were celebrating their 30th wedding anniversary, pose with the cyborg (complete with a white bow tie) for a photo 

In front of the 80 guests, they then pretended that Paul's brother Martin, the original best man, had lost the ring.

Briefly after running out of the doors in a panic, the entrance was filled with a cloud of smoke - and a Dalek entered carrying the ring.

The model - wearing a white bow tie - moved slowly down the aisle and was greeted by vicar Graham Herbert.

He welcomed the Dalek to Earth before it turned and ordered the congregation to 'all show respect to the reverend'.

Paul, 55, dressed Doctor Who-style in a long scarf, fez and carrying a sonic screwdriver, got on one knee and proposed again to Joanne who wore a black lace dress and Tardis hair ribbon.

He told her: 'You look just as beautiful today as you did when I first met you and I wanted to ask you just one more time, will you marry me?'

Threat: Reverend Graham Herbert welcomed the model into the church. The Dalek then turned to the congregation and asked them to show respect for the vicar

Joanne, 52, a senior midwife, said yes and Rev Herbert told them 'You may kiss - or else be exterminated.'

Paul said the ceremony at St Paul's Church, Gravesend, Kent last Saturday took place after they offered to raise money for a local charity.

The sci-fi fans also received a special signed photograph from former Doctor Who star David Tennant congratulating them on their special day.

Paul, a maternity manager, said: 'We didn't really plan to do all of this.

Invading the vows: The fictional cyborg stands next to the reverend and the couple, both dressed in Doctor Who-themed outfits as the ceremony gets under way

Plan: As the ceremony began, Peter's brother Martin returned to him, pretending he had forgotten the ring 

'Originally we just wanted to walk down to aisle to the Doctor Who theme tune but then when Jo bought me the Dalek for my birthday, well, this all happened.

'The Dalek was actually an actor in a costume, I don't think the guests were expecting it.

'It's definitely something to remember.

'The vicar was a bit sceptical about it, particularly the Dalek as it's the epitome of evil but thankfully that all worked out.

'When we spoke about doing it for charity, he was up for it and even let us split the collection plate from the ceremony.'

The couple, who share their home in Erith, Kent with three cats, are now auctioning off their hundreds of pieces of Dr Who memorabilia for charity.

They hope to raise £2,000 for Little Buds Fund for special care babies at Darent Valley Hospital where they work.

Appreciation: The guests clapped and took photos as Peter got down on one knee and reconfirmed his love for his wife

Paul added: 'Joanne and I have always been huge fans of Dr Who, even before we met. I remember watching it as a kid.'

Joanne said: 'I can remember I used to hide behind the couch when I was a child watching Dr Who. I've always been a fan.

'It was an amazing wedding and I'm glad we decided to do something different.'

After the ceremony the couple had a party complete with tardis table decorations, Daleks and Cybermen.

They originally met on a blind date when Joanne was a trainee midwife and Paul was an undertaker.

Rev Herbert said: 'They're great science fiction fans and that love of sci-fi is part of their marriage.

'They wanted to raise funds for the Little Buds fund at Darent Valley Hospital and so I was happy to do something for them.

'I've never had a wedding quite like this.'

A Darent Valley Hospital spokesman said: 'We wish Joanne and Paul the very best of health and happiness as they continue their adventures in space and time together.

'Reaffirming their vows in front of their family, friends and at the point of a Dalek blaster was a delight to see and hear.

'Paul made a wonderful Doctor Who at his wedding but there was no mistaking who is the Master.'
