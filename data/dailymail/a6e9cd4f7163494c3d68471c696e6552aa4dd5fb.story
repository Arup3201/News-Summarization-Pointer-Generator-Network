A perverted 17-year-old manager at a Long John Silver’s in California allegedly hid a cell phone in the women’s bathroom to secretly record videos of customers using the stall.

The unnamed supervisor in Vallejo was fired from his restaurant job, arrested and released to his parents with a court date, CBS13 in Sacramento reports.

Because the suspect is a minor, his name was not released to the public.

No privacy: The Long John Silver's in Vallejo, California, where a 17-year-old manager allegedly hid a camera in the women's bathroom

Caught: Local police say one customer and her daughter reported the incident after noticing the recording device, which turned out to be a cell phone

‘The person who did it is sick,’ a local woman told CBS13. ‘He needs to be put away.’

Local police say one customer and her daughter recently noticed what appeared to be a digital video recorder as they were using the bathroom.

Officers arrived at the fast food spot and found the cell phone hidden in a vent of the women’s restroom.

The phone had been recording video images when it was discovered.

The officers at the scene of the creepy discovery say they have taken custody of the cell phone, but are unsure how many possible victims there may have been.

Invasion of privacy: The restroom stall the camera was facing

Major violation: The suspect was ¿invading the absolute highest degree of privacy that someone would expect to have in the restroom,¿ said Vallejo Police Lt. Sid DeJesus

A Long John Silver’s employee told CBS13 that she was instructed not to comment on the incident.

She confirmed that the suspect was fired and that he had worked there for about three months.

Female customers say they now fear that this wasn’t the first time an incident like this occurred there.

The suspect was ‘invading the absolute highest degree of privacy that someone would expect to have in the restroom,’ Lt. Sid DeJesus of the Vallejo Police Department told CBS13.
