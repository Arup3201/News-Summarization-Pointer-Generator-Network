Teenage sweethearts have finally been reunited with their daughter 46 years after they were forced to give her up for adoption.

Inge Dart was just 17 when she fell pregnant by her boyfriend Jeremy Owen, who is the nephew of celebrated First World War poet Wilfred Owen.

It was 1968 and they were living in British colonial settlements in Africa at the time. When Inge's mother discovered what had happened, she hit the roof.

Back together: Chantal and her birth mother, Inge, have been reunited decades after she was forced to have her adopted as a baby

'She
 called me a whore and a prostitute and all sorts of names like that,' Inge recalls on tonight's episode of Long Lost Family. 'Her edict was that I was to go to England and "serve out my term" and then 
the baby was to be adopted.'

Inge, now 66 and living in Dorset, said her mother was a domineering force in her life and she never dared to disobey her.

'It was her terms or nothing, as a child or teenager, I would not question any decision she made,' she said.

As a result, Inge was sent to live with a couple in Surrey while she was pregnant, where Jeremy, who was now training to be a dentist in London, visited her once a week.

Long overdue hug: Jeremy was devastated that he was never allowed to hold his daughter after she was born

Inge believes they would have made wonderful parents to their baby - if only they had been given the chance.

But as soon as their daughter - who they named Sandra - was born, Inge's mother took control.

Inge spent just 10 days in the company of her baby, on one of which, Jeremy was allowed to visit.

'He took one look at her and cried. He 
looked at me and it was perfect,' she remembers. 'Then my mother arrived and said "are you
 ready to go?" she drove us to a foster home.'

Jeremy, now living in Australia, recalls he wasn't even able to give his daughter a hug.

'The staff told me I wasn't to even 
consider holding the child as it might affect the bonding of the child to
 her new parents,' he said.

The teenagers' relationship failed to withstand the ordeal and not long after they had to give their baby away, they split up.

'We realised mother's dominance had won. I did what I was told and not what I wanted to do,' Inge said.

Since then, she's had to live with the heartache of losing her baby and always wondered what happened to her and if she was happy.

Inge went on to marry and have two more children but she said she never forgot her first born.

'I have spent 46 years without 
peace, if I could find my daughter, just to know she's had the life I 
would have wished for, then I'll find that peace,' she said.

Her wish was finally granted by ITV show Long Lost Family, who tracked their daughter down.

Chantal was amazed to discover she is related to war poet Wilfred Owen through her birth father

She had been renamed Chantal by her adoptive parents and had moved to France, where she currently lives with two children and works as an air stewardess.

Chantal said she was overcome with emotions when she heard her birth mother was trying to find her.

'It's a panic and a mixture of excitement, impatience and questions,' she said of how she was feeling.

She revealed how she had a happy upbringing with her adoptive parents and wonderful siblings.

On wanting to meet her birth parents, she said: 'It's not replacing, it's riching and adding.'

She said she was glad to hear that Inge and Jeremy had once been in love and that she wasn't an unwanted product of a fling.

Inge wrote Chantal a letter saying she couldn't wait to be reunited with her.

'You have always been in my heart 
since the day you were born... I pray to god I am given the chance to 
tell you how sorry I am and how much I have loved you all these years,' she wrote.

Meanwhile, the ITV show's researchers also tracked down Jeremy, who has four other grown up children, and he was over joyed that he would finally get to meet his long lost daughter.

He said: 'When I heard she wanted to see me, I realised I can finally give her
 that hug, even though it's 46 years late.'

He added: 'I always hoped this moment may come but I thought it never would. It's like a fairytale but a real one.'
