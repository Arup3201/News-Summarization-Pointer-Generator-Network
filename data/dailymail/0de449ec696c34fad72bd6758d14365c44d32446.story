She's the heir to a multi-billion pound empire and living in the fast lane is something Tamara Ecclestone knows all about.

So, when it came to celebrating her 30th birthday last night, the heiress didn't do things by half measures.

The socialite, model and television personality threw a lavish party with her husband, Jay Rutland, mother Slavica, sister Petra, brother-in-law James Stunt, as well as the likes of rapper P Diddy and comedian Michael McIntyre.

What a soiree! Formula 1 heiress Tamara Eccleston, pictured with her husband Jay Rutland, threw a lavish 30th birthday in London last night

P Diddy, who can cost around £700,000 for an hour's set, was flown in by Tamara to perform especially for her party at the trendy ME Hotel on London's Strand, while Michael McIntyre, who can command between £30,000 - £40,000 for trotting out an hour of material, provided the comedy. 

It would seem Tamara had her heart set on the roof terrace location at the trendy London hotel, which can accomodate 240 guests and has stunning views of the London skyline.

A member of public had originally booked the rooftop location for a birthday party a few weeks in advance, but two days before the event was due to take place, the hotel called to cancel the booking, saying they had double booked.

Look who stopped by! P Diddy was flown in by Tamara to perform especially for her party

Providing the laughs: English comedian, Michael McIntyre, was also on hand to perform at the ME London hotel

The hotel clearly preferred the idea of the celebrity event to the original booking and the other party was moved to a downstairs location in the hotel.

To make up for their disappointment, ME London reportedly gave the member of public £1,000 towards the cost of their party in compensation, according to a source.

Speaking to MailOnline about having her party moved, Danni Woolner said: 'My husband had booked the bar for my birthday and we received an email from the bar manager telling us that they had to cancel it to make way for a bigger event.

'We weren’t told that it was Tamara Ecclestone’s birthday, but I was obviously quite disappointed. The bar then offered us the restaurant as an alternative venue and we were compensated.'

Tamara's management, however, deny such a rumour. A spokesman for the heiress said: 'There was no double booking and no one was paid off.

'The venue was available when we looked into it as a possible location several months ago and it was still available when we went ahead and confirmed the booking, there was no other party interested in the same date.'

To book the Radio Rooftop Bar on a 
Sunday night requires a minimum spend of £65,000 and must be booked at 
least a month in advance.

ME by Meliá is the fashion-forward brand of the Spanish hotel group and has fast become the go-to hang-out for London's elite.

Located on Strand, a stone's throw from Somerset House, it became the unofficial hotel of London Fashion Week last season with designers and A-listers alike enjoying post-show parties on the famous roof top bar.

Describing
 itself on the website, it says: 'ME London has a splendid location on Strand on the southern tip of Covent Garden, just a short way from 
the Thames and Trafalgar Square. The neighbourhood is the home of 
some of the City's finest art galleries, museums, restaurants, bars, 
shopping and nightlife. The hotel itself has a rich history as the 
former site of Marconi House, Gaiety Theatre and Strand Music Hall.

'The hotel
 has plenty to offer guests, with a state-of-the-art fitness facility 
(open 24 hours a day), in-room spa treatments on request, underground 
valet parking, concierge service, same-day laundry and dry cleaning, 
twice-daily housekeeping, secretarial service and complimentary Wi-Fi 
throughout the hotel.'

The 
cheapest room that the hotel offers will set you back £330 per night, 
while an evening in the 'Passion Suite' costs £1,180 per night.

If you really want to splash out, Suite Me, which is located on the ninth and tenth floors and offers a 99 square metre space with impressive views of London Eye, Houses of Parliament, Trafalgar Square and the Thames, costs £4,375 per night.

On Saturday morning 
husband Jay gave Tamara an incredibly large 30 sign made from stunning, 
dark pink flowers to mark her milestone year, similar to the wall of 
blooms Kanye West presented Kim Kardashian with for Mother's Day.

Keen to 
show her gift to her Twitter followers she posted a picture of herself and
 her baby daughter Sophia, dwarfed by the pretty backdrop.

The
 heiress cradled her cute tot in her arms, who had been dressed in a 
special outfit which read: 'Happy Birthday Mummy I Love You'.  

Tamara
 shared the snaps on her Instagram page, including one of her 
balloon-filled living room. She thanked her sister in the caption,

beautiful flowers'.
