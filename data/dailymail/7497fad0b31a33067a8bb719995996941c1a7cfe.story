Clutching a mug and newspaper in a suburban coffee shop, meet married mother-of-four Kate Pippinger - the new face of the pro-marijuana movement.

She is the actress starring in a short ad due to be released tomorrow by New Approach Washington - a group calling for legalization and regulation of the drug - who are hoping to target women aged 30-50.

The clip opens with Mrs Pippinger's remark: 'I don't like it personally but it's time for a conversation about legalizing marijuana.'

Campaign makeover: Kate Pippinger has appeared in the latest advert by New Approach Washington who are calling for the legalization of cannabis

Advocate: Mrs Pippinger begins the video by saying that she doesn't smoke pot but that it's time to talk about legalizing for the good of the general public

Mrs Pippinger is a paid actress who was specifically chosen to front the new $1million advertising campaign because she believes in the issue.

Alison Holcomb, campaign director for 
New Approach, told MailOnline that Mrs Pippinger fitted the demographic of 'soft supporters open to the idea of legalization'.

Ms Holcomb said: 'We wanted a messenger who clicked with the viewer, a mom who is concerned about the issue in general.'

New Approach Washington believes that police resources
are wasted going after adults who use marijuana and that a tightly 
regulated system would take money away from drug dealers and benefit the general public.

A tax-regulated drug system would filter money into improvements for healthcare and schools, advocates claimed.Â 

Professional cause: New Approach Washington is made up of doctors, lawyers, drug experts and concerned parents, according to their website

Deeply critical: Ed Holmes, police chief of Mercer Island in Washington State, condemned the group saying that marijuana led to people committing crimes they would not normally commit

New Approach has launched the pro-cannabis campaign in order to pass Initiative 502 - a measure to license and regulate marijuana production, 
distribution and possession for those over the age of 21. The legislation would decriminalize the drug and tax sales of marijuana.

The TV ad will be aired in the 
Seattle area and run until August 25. The coalition is made up of 
doctors, lawyers, drug experts and parents, according to their website.

However Mercer Island police chief Ed Holmes was highly skeptical of the plan. He told ABC:'I don't know how it makes good sense to legalize something that serves no purpose other than to cause impairment.

'People say things they otherwise 
wouldn't say, they do things they otherwise wouldn't do, they commit 
crimes they otherwise wouldn't commit.'

Those who live in Washington State will be able to vote on Initiative 502 in the November 6 elections.
