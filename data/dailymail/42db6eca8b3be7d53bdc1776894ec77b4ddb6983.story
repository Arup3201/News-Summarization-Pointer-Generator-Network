English seaside resorts are among the most deprived places in the country, blighted by high unemployment, poor health and riddled with crime, official figures revealed yesterday.

The report, from the Office for National Statistics, lays bare the crisis facing resorts from Blackpool to Clacton, Ramsgate to Margate.

It comes after a recent report, from the Centre for Social Justice, said seaside towns have become ‘dumping grounds’ following the destruction of their economies by cheap foreign travel.

Resorts which used to be thriving have
become heavily populated by welfare claimants, those with substance 
abuse and mental health problems and patients leaving the care system, 
it said.

The ONS looked at 
England’s 57 biggest seaside resorts, based on the size of population. 
To be included in the list, the resort must have a resident population 
of at least 15,000.

Towns 
which it investigated include the ‘big two’ - Brighton and Bournemouth -
as well as many other household names such as Weston-super-Mare, 
Scarborough, Skegness and Whitstable.

Many
popular seaside resorts, such as the Prime Minister’s current holiday 
destination, Polzeath, and other idyllic Cornish resorts, were not 
included due to their small resident population.

‘The likely size of the tourist population on a sunny, summer weekend’ was ignored, the ONS said.

Overall,
larger seaside destinations, such as Clacton, Ramsgate and Hartlepool, 
are more deprived than the rest of England typically is. ‘Larger’ 
resorts have a minimum population of 40,500 And Blackpool is the most 
deprived of them all, based on the ONS’s assessment of key measures of 
deprivation such as higher unemployment, lower incomes, poor health and 
more crime.

Among smaller 
seaside destinations, Skegness and Ingoldmells, the site of Billy 
Butlins’s first holiday camp in 1936, is the most deprived resort.

The ONS’s report highlights how pockets of deprivation exist in England, next door to exclusive and much-coveted destinations.

Skegness was also among the 57 seaside resorts the ONS looked at

For
example, Blackpool is a short drive from Lytham St Annes, which is one 
of the least deprived of the 57 seaside destinations beaten only by the 
more exclusive Christchurch in Dorset.

Lytham
St Annes is internationally renowned for golf, particularly the Royal 
Lytham and St Annes Gold Club, one of the host courses for the Open 
Championship.

Meanwhile, 
Blackpool has introduced a free school breakfast for all its 12,000 
primary school pupils following fears they were arriving for school too 
hungry to concentrate properly.

The
Centre for Social Justice’s report found more than 40 per cent of 
children were fatherless in areas of Blackpool, while house prices have 
plunged to an average price of just £77,000.

A
Treasury spokesman said: ‘These 2010 statistics show that, under the 
last administration, too many seaside towns and villages suffered from 
economic decline and neglect.

‘There
is huge potential for our coastal towns to welcome new industries and 
to diversify their economies so they can become year-round success 
stories.

‘The Government’s 
Coastal Communities Fund was set up in 2011 to help these towns tap into
new business opportunities that will create jobs and boost skills that 
benefit the whole community.’
