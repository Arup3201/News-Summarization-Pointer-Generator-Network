He's the Australian jihadist who, in between swearing to cleanse the world of infidel non-believers, apparently sees a lighter side in the Islamic State's barbaric war.

Zia Abdul-Haq, a militant from Logan, south of Brisbane, who is fighting for IS in the Middle East, has purportedly posted a series of videos on YouTube with titles such as 'funny terrorist video part 1' - as well as Twitter images of militants cuddling cats, playing video games and training with assault weaponry.

Terrorism experts said the often jokey social media posts proved the immaturity of some Westerners who have taken up arms fighting for the so-called 'caliphate'.

Pledged his allegiance to the Islamic State (IS): Zia Abdul-Haq, from Brisbane, is pictured in a variety of social media posts. 

'#Mujahid crime! The cat love this young #French mujahid': Abdul-Haq posted this sarcastic caption alongside this picture of a purported French jihadist patting a small cat.

Down time? Abdul-Huq captioned this image, of apparent militants wearing military fatigues, as 'jihadists having fun =)'. Their location is unknown.

Abdul-Haq, who also goes by the name Abu Yusseph, has posted a number of images making light of IS's sinister reputation. 

A picture of a French IS fighter stroking a cat is captioned sarcastically: '#IS crime! The cat love this young mujahid (fighter)'. In another, he mocks the idea IS is cruel by showing fighters cutting up a dead animal and labelling them 'IS crimes'. 

Two militants are seen horsing around in Abdul-Haq's 'funny terrorist' video series, with one militant mimicking one of U.S. President Barack Obama's video greetings to the global Islamic community. 

But some of the material is much more chilling. 'Every #IS #mujahid needs to carry a big knife for slaughtering the enemies. It's more fun to slaughter :-)', reads one of Abdul-Haq's posts. 'May our blood become a flood to clean this world from all types of (non-believers)', said another.

And while there is little evidence he has actively fought in the conflict zone, one message represented threatened Australian troops: 'Media propaganda is only to prepare the way for Australia and the West to send troops to fight , we hope to give them a good welcome'.

Professor Greg Barton, from the Global Terrorism Research Centre at Monash University, said Abdul-Haq's posts showed that many IS fighters were 'juveniles' who did not understand the gravity of what they were doing.

Pretending to be Barack Obama: With his head covered by black cloth, militants are caught on camera imitating the U.S. President. The videos were posted to YouTube by an account purported to belong to Abdul-Haq.

'Funny terrorist part2': The straight to the point caption on Abdul-Haq's apparent YouTube video. 

Weaponry: This image of ammunition and an assault weapon is one of many pictures posted to social media by the jihadist.

'Training': The militants. Few images are posted where any of the militants' faces are evident

The Abbott government revealed last month that it feared around 60 Australians were  fighting in the Middle East.

'For the most part, they're young idiots,' Prof Barton told Daily Mail Australia. 'We're dealing with young men doing foolish things, driven by peer pressure and a desire for affirmation.'

He compared it to teenagers posting images on Facebook in order to attract high numbers of 'likes'. He said the militants posted jokes - and gruesome material - to get attention. 

'I think it's generally true for (their) social media posts that what we see reflects a fairly juvenile mentality,' he said. 

'There's not a lot of deep reflection on religious themes or agonising over moral choices'.

Ali Kadri, a spokesman for the Holland Park mosque which Abdul-Haq occasionally visited for Friday prayers, told Daily Mail Australia Abdul-Haq did not appear to have an aggressive personality.

'He wasn't that kind of person. I remember him as a shy, quiet kind of person'.

In recent months, the Islamic State - which is also known by the names ISIS and ISIL - has not hesitated in showing the gruesome lengths it is willing to go to in prosecuting its war. 

In the past month, the group's media arm has released videos depicting the beheadings of two Western journalists, James Foley and Steven Sotloff.

Australian militants Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar also sparked international condemnation after they distributed images of themselves - and Sharrouf's seven-year-old child - brandishing the heads of decapitated Syrian fighters. 

Gruesome: The Islamic State have released videos of two U.S. journalists being beheaded in the past month.

Abdul-Haq, who also goes under the identity of Abu Yussuph, has in recent days tweeted about how 'proud' he is to fight for the Islamic State. 

'I never been part of any group / organisation in Australia or anywhere else, but I am proud to be part of #IslamicState', he said. 

Abdul-Haq also denied claims he was 'brainwashed' by Australian preacher Musa Cerantonio into taking up arms for the Islamic State, labelling them 'media lies'.

'No one brainwashed me,' Yusseph wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. 'Don't believe media'. 

Cerantonio said the allegation was unsubstantiated. Abdul-Haq did not respond to a request for an interview.

In July, Cerantonio was arrested by Philippine authorities and deported to Australia, just weeks after he tweeted that he had arrived in the Middle East to join his brothers in the Islamic State.

'Al-Hamdulillah I have arrived in the land of Khilafah in Ash-Sham! May Allah honor all Muslims during this blessed time with His obedience,' he posted on Twitter at the time. 

On August 17, Abdul-Haq posted an image of fighters in the Middle East watching a video of Cerantonio. 

'Mujahideen (warriors) in Ash-Shaam watching Musa Cerantonio's talks #IS #ISIS #jihadist #caliphate #Khilafah'. Cerantonio was approached for comment.

Abdul-Haq's social media presence remains active.  

Preacher: Musa Cerantonio.
