A Florida high school student suspended after appearing in pornographic films has been allowed to return to class.

Robert Marucci has been allowed to return to Cocoa High School after officials said they had been wrong to punish the 18-year-old.

The high school senior had been excluded from school after other students circulated images two weeks ago, showing Robert in adult films that he appeared in to help his mother pay bills.

Back to class: Robert Marucci has been allowed to return to Cocoa High School

Support: Melyssa Lieb says she is proud of her son for trying to earn cash for the family

By being excluded Robert risked not being allowed to graduate, but Brevard County School District reversed its decision on Tuesday to let the teenager return to class.

Robert told NBC he had done nothing wrong, and had appeared
 in the film to help his family pay bills.

His mother, Melyssa Lieb, supported her son, whose initial suspension had caused
 a protest by dozens of classmates last week.

'I think he's the most awesome person in the world,' she told WKMG through tears. 'He stood up and he was the man of the house when I couldn't be.'

Michelle Irwin, a district spokeswoman, said: 'No child would ever be suspended for a job that they have outside of the school environment.'

Even after he had been suspended, Robert remained unapologetic for the work he considers no different to any other job.

The debacle began two weeks ago when fellow students at Cocoa High School discovered his videos on an adult website and started showing each other the explicit images on their phones.

The website shows Robert, who goes by
 the name of 'Noel', posing naked and having sex with other men, as well
 as featuring in an introductory video about his love of surfing.

Despite his pride in his work, when the photos emerged at school, he was targeted by bullies, WKMG reported.

School administrators called him a 'major disruption', according to the referral slip.

A friend posted on Reddit that Robert was suspended for 10 days, which meant that he would not be unable to graduate because of an automatic 'failure from absences'.

'I feel like I have been treated unfairly and this is unjust,' Robert said. 'This was completely legal. I didn't break any laws, and this took place out of the school.'

His
 mother added: I don't think that this is anybody's business except for my son.'

Robert's mother wasn't the only one who supported him, as dozens staged a walkout at the school on Friday. A Facebook group was also set up to support him.
