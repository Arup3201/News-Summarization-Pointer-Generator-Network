The Lake District is to be nominated for World Heritage status.

England's largest national park will be able to submit a bid to UN heritage body Unesco in 2016 to become a World Heritage site, Culture Minister Ed Vaizey said.

If it secures World Heritage status, it will join the likes of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the Great Wall of China and the Grand Canyon in the US as sites with outstanding value to the world.

The UK already has almost 30 cultural and natural sites on the World Heritage List, ranging from the Tower of London to the Giant's Causeway and Stonehenge.

Globally, almost 1,000 sites are listed for their heritage value.

Mr Vaizey said: 'The UK's heritage is world-renowned and the Lake District, England's largest national park, is one of our heritage jewels.

'The Unesco nomination process can be very demanding and success is not guaranteed but I believe the Lake District deserves to be recognised and inscribed as a World Heritage Site and I wish all involved the very best.

The Lake District was one of six sites which came forward for consideration for nomination by an independent expert group.

The others were Chatham Dockyard and its defences, the Flow Country, Jodrell Bank observatory, the Zenith of Iron Age Shetland and the twin monastery of Wearmouth-Jarrow.

The Lake District joins the Forth Bridge near Edinburgh and Gorham's Cave complex in Gibraltar on the UK's tentative list of potential future World Heritage nominations. The Forth Bridge is being put forward this year, and Gorham's Cave complex in 2015.

Mike Innerdale, assistant director of operation for National Trust (North West), which looks after a fifth of the countryside, hills and rivers in the Lake District, welcomed confirmation the national park would be the next nomination.

'The National Trust has cared for the natural heritage of the Lake District for 100 years and this is a brilliant opportunity to share these special spaces with an international audience,' he said.

The long-running bid to secure World Heritage status for the Lake District stretches back to the 1980s.

Chief executive of the Lake District National Park Richard Leafe said: 'World Heritage inscription will boost the international profile of the Lake District's unique awe-inspiring landscape, which has evolved over thousands of years.

'We believe it is possible to strike the balance between conserving our historical cultural roots at the same time as encouraging regeneration to meet the needs of a thriving, modern region.

'World Heritage designation can help us meet this tough challenge - attracting valuable international cultural tourism will also be a catalyst for increased investment in heritage, culture and farming to help us make the most of our greatest asset, the spectacular cultural landscape.'

The nomination will go through an 18-month process of scrutiny and evaluation by Unesco and its advisory body, the International Council on Monuments and Sites, with a decision expected in July 2017.
