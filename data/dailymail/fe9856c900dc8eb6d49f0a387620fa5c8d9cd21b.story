Nick Clegg clearly suffered when the spoof musical version of his apology for breaking his promise not to raise university fees was played on the Andrew Marr show.

Trying to laugh it off, he managed: ‘It’s catchy, very catchy.’

Mr Clegg has given permission for the track to be released in aid of charity. Last night it was at 143 in the singles chart.

Awkward: Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg grimaces as the remix of his videoed apology for breaking his manifesto promise not to raise tuition fees is played on the Andrew Marr show

Following his interview with political journalist Mr Marr, the Deputy Prime Minister was asked during a Lib Dem conference Q&A what he would do if the song reached number one in the pop charts.

But it was his decision to apologise for promising to block a rise in tuition fees – subsequently broken after the coalition was formed – which dominated the hour long session, during which he also revealed yesterday was his wedding anniversary.

Uppermost in people’s minds was the idea that the hilarious remix of his ‘sorry’ video – in which he appeared to sing his apology – was set to make him the first Cabinet minister to have a single in the top 40.

Questions about how Nick Clegg would celebrate if his remixed apology video topped the charts proved academic - the song by satirical website The Poke only reached 143

Nick Clegg Says I'm Sorry (the 
Autotune remix) stormed up the iTunes chart after its release on Friday 
night, reaching number 35 ahead of the likes of Kanye West and Carly Rae
 Jepson.

But when Radio 1 DJ Reggie Yates announced the official chart tonight, Mr Clegg was nowhere to be seen.

Based on record sales for the entire 
week, it seems the release of the Clegg song late on Friday night came 
too late to make an impression on the record-buying public.

It scraped into the top 150 after the 
Lib Dem leader gave permission to the track's creator, satirical website
 www.thepoke.co.uk, to release it as a single.

Mr Clegg told the conference: 'Just 
when I thought life couldn't get any stranger, a video of me gets 
remixed and becomes a YouTube sensation.'

All profits from the song's success 
will be given to Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust, of which his
 wife Miriam is a patron.

The Script held on to their number one
 slot with Hall of Fame despite a late challenge from YouTube sensation 
Psy whose Gangnam Style climbed 13 places since midweek to land at 
Number 3.

The established pop acts left the Deputy Prime Minister trailing.

Mr Clegg admitted he found the mocking
 remix of his tuition fees apology 'amusing' as he defended the decision
 to say sorry two years after breaking the pledge to vote against any 
rise in university charges.

Lib Dem activists applauded when Nick Clegg announced it was the 12th anniversary of tyring the knot with Miriam

Opinion in Brighton was split over 
whether the apology was the right thing to do, with many activists still
 signed up to the idea of abolishing tuition fees.

But Mr Clegg defended the apology, filmed at his home in Putney, south west London.

He told delegates in the conference 
hall: 'I hope with the passage of time more people reaise that the 
system which is coming into effect is not as pernicious as it was 
thought.’

But he was challenged by one activist 
who pointed out that before the 2010 general election Mr Clegg had 
promised the Lib Dems would be the party that did not break promises, 
‘and then first thing we did was break a promise’.

Whose round is it? Nick Clegg gets the drinks in

Mr Clegg insisted: ‘To my dying day I firmly believe we did the right thing by going into government.’

He later stumbled on his words when 
referring to the economic plight of other European countries, telling 
the audience he mentioned Spain’s woes in trepidation because his 
Spanish wife Miriam had just arrived.

But he saved his strongest words to 
confirm his determination to block 'wild' Tory demands for another 
£10billion to be slashed off the benefit bill after 2015.

'I know there are some people in this 
hall who think that someone in government is itching to bite out bigger 
chunks of public spending during this spending review period, which 
extends from now till April 2015.'

The Cleggs toasted their anniversary with soft drinks in the Hilton Hotel, Brighton

He added: 'Let me be really clear - we are going to stick to the spending plans. When we look for additional savings in the years ahead the Lib Dems will start at the top and work

'What I can assure you is that we will not allow some of these wild suggestions that have been made from the right of British politics, that all the savings can be made from welfare. "Let's just scoop out a great £10 billion size hole for welfare". No.

'Nor will I accept some of the wilder suggestions that we should just wave a wand and say we'll put a freeze on all benefits for two years across the whole piece.'
