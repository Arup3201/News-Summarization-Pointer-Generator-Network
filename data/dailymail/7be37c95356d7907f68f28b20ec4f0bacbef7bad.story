A couple who beat a toddler so severely it was left with two broken arms, a broken right leg and a broken left foot have been spared jail because it was their first offence.

Emma Cartwright and partner Neil Gleaves, both 27, then left the child's broken leg untreated for 'at least two days' before taking the toddler to hospital. 

Cartwright was also convicted of slapping a baby in the face before Gleaves violently shook it.

Spared jail: Emma Cartwright, 27, and her partner Neil Gleaves, also 27, were given a 36 week prison sentence suspended for two years after being convicted of child cruelty and neglect

The couple were convicted of child cruelty and neglect at Stoke Crown Court on Thursday but walked free after a judge heard it was their first offence and Gleaves was 'hardworking'.

Instead, the couple from Wolstanton, Staffordshire, were given a 36 week prison sentence suspended for two years with a supervision order.

Gleaves was also ordered to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work.

Recorder Simon Ward told them: 'You’ve both been convicted of very serious offences and you’re going to have to live with the consequences.

'Offences of cruelty and ill-treatment of children are so serious that the courts have to send out a message to people that, if convicted, serious sentences will follow.'

The court heard the couple attacked the toddler who was taken to University Hospital of North Staffordshire with serious injuries.

Staff found the toddler's leg had been broken for at least two days before she was brought in to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire

On arriving at hospital shocked medics found the child’s right leg had been broken at least two days earlier.

David Bennett, prosecuting, said: 'Neither defendant could account for how that injury was caused. The medical staff were concerned and a full radiological survey was carried out.

'The whole body was X-rayed and it was discovered the child had a number of significant injuries to its bones.

'The child had fractures to both arms, both legs, left foot and left shoulder, all of which, it was deemed by the medical staff, were non-accidental injuries and were caused deliberately to the child.'

The couple were spared jail after the judge heard how the defendants had no previous convictions.

Nick Tatlow, defending, also said Cartwright had experienced a 'troubled' past and had been cared for by 14 different foster families as a child.

He said: 'Her actions amounted to a temporary loss of temper.'

Anis Ali, defending Gleaves added: 'He is, and was, a hard-working individual. He understands the consequences of this conviction will last forever.'
