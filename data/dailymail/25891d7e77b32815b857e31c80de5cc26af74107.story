Fordham University's Bronx, New York campus was full of proud parents this weekend, celebrating the class of 2014's graduation.

But one parent was noticeably missing - Prince Albert II of Monaco.

While his daughter Jazmin Grace Grimaldi was getting her degree on Saturday, Prince Albert  was attending a fashion show in Monte Carlo.

Where's dad? While his daughter was graduating from Fordham University on Saturday, Prince Albert II of Monaco was attending a Louis Vuitton fashion show with his wife, Princess Charlene

On one of the most important days of his daughter's life, Albert was pictured smiling alongside wife Princess Charlene at a Louis Vuitton fashion show.

Arguably, Jazmin's graduation had bad timing as it corresponded with the annual Cannes Film Festival which runs from May 14 - 25 and Albert attends the nearby festival every year.

But Albert's absense at the graduation is just the latest sting in his shaky relationship with Jazmin, his illegitimate daughter from a brief romance with American Tamara Rotolo.

Rotolo met the prince at a tennis tournament during a three-week vacation in the French Riviera in 1991.

According to People, the couple stayed in touch on her return to the U.S. when she learned of the pregnancy but the Prince then cut off contact when she gave birth.

Rotolo managed to force the paternity issue in 1993 when the Prince visited Cody, Wyoming, and she confronted him with their 17-month-old daughter.

On Tuesday Albert attended a Charity Soccer match between Formula One drivers and a Star Team made of former and current sports stars at the Louis ll stadium in Monaco

It is unknown if his daughter inherited his sports prowess

Prince Albert, who also has 10-year-old son Alexandre Coste out of wedlock, eventually confirmed he was Jazmin’s father on June 1, 2006 when she was 14, but said he had wanted to protect her identity until she was an adult.

That same year the then-teenager went on a humanitarian mission to Fiji and donated 30,000 prenatal vitamins to a hospital, as well as visiting a school for the disabled.

Prince Albert has since married Princess Charlene of Monaco and Jazmin attended the Princess Grace Awards in October 2012 with her father and stepmother.

Lately, Jazmin has been stepping more and more into the spotlight. Earlier this month, Jazmin walked the red carpet at the New York premiere of the film The Immigrant, and also attended the Hoolywood Reporter's 35 Most Powerful People in Media celebration in April.

While Jazmin's film star grandmother Grace Kelly was American, her father Albert and his sisters Caroline and Stephanie were raised in Monaco, as were Jazmin's cousins.

Years ago Albert II, who is now 56, told Paris Match that Jazmin was welcome to live in Monaco and added of his two children: ‘What matters to me is they are certain of my affection for them.’

While the illegitimate status of her birth means Jazmin has no rights over the Monaco crown, she will inherit her portion of her father's huge fortune.

She's becoming a pro at this: The 22-year-old attended the Hollywood Reporter 35 Most Powerful People In Media Celebration last month
