Witnesses from India and England in the Jimmy Anderson-Ravindra Jadeja bust-up were branded ‘hopelessly biased’ by the investigating official.

This contributed to Gordon Lewis, the Australian judicial commissioner who presided over the tribunal, dropping all charges against the players.

Lewis, who reached his conclusion in 10 minutes after a six-hour hearing, reportedly outlined in his written verdict that he could not be ‘comfortably satisfied’ about the precise nature of the contretemps in the Trent Bridge pavilion last month. This was because there was no video evidence and the only neutral testimony, from one of the Nottinghamshire stewards, was inconclusive.

Lewis also suggested Jadeja’s claim that Anderson had pushed him ‘hard and caused him to break stride’ was a ‘recent embellishment’. The commissioner was also critical of Adam Lewis, counsel for the Board of Control for Cricket in India, whose suggestion that Anderson had pushed Jadeja twice did not have ‘an iota of supporting evidence’.

India claimed Anderson shoved Jadeja without provocation as the players entered the pavilion for lunch on the second day of the first Test and told him to ‘f****** go back to the dressing-room’.

While Anderson is said to have agreed he used those words, he insisted that Jadeja had been the aggressor.

Gordon Lewis said: ‘Obviously one version of the facts must be untrue but the existing CCTV image is unhelpful and the witnesses hopelessly biased in favour of one party or the other.’

He considered downgrading Anderson’s charge from a Level 3 offence — with the threat of a four-match ban — to a Level 2 and then a Level 1 offence but was unwilling to uphold any charge on the evidence available and suggested the ICC’s Code of Conduct contained a ‘number of inadequacies’.

He added that a tribunal should not ‘guess to achieve an outcome,’ as quoted in his report on the ESPN Cricinfo website.

‘In short I do not know on the evidence, and to the relevant standard of proof, what happened in the corridor leading to the stairway in those few seconds after the batsmen and fielding side came in for lunch.

‘I cannot be comfortably satisfied as to the truth of either version of the evidence.’
