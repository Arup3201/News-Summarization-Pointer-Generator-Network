Civil servants are spending hours each week editing Wikipedia pages on trivial subjects – including Sir Elton John and Jurassic Park.

Comedian Roy ‘Chubby’ Brown, Scottish football clubs and Nazi paratroopers are among hundreds of other entries on the online encyclopedia that have been edited from Whitehall computers.

Since January, more than 600 Wikipedia edits – more than two every working day – can be traced back to Government computers.

Civil servants changed the Wikipedia page for Roy 'Chubby' Brown (pictured) from a Government computer to add details of his recent court case where he was convicted of driving without due care and attention

These have previously been identified as the source of controversial changes of sensitive entries, including the Hillsborough disaster and, earlier this month, the spare room subsidy, described by critics as the ‘bedroom tax’.

A 24-year-old civil servant was fired in June after he edited the phrase ‘You’ll never walk alone’, the anthem of Liverpool FC, to read: ‘You’ll never walk again’ on the Hillsborough section of the site in 2012.

Now an investigation by the Daily Mail has discovered that Whitehall computers have also been responsible for thousands of tweaks to more trivial topics in recent years.

It will raise questions over how civil servants are able to get away with wasting so much time on an irrelevant activity. 

Almost anyone can edit pages on Wikipedia, which is the sixth most popular website on the internet, with nearly 500million unique visitors a month.

One user tweaked the Jurrasic Park Wikipedia page stating 'I don't think Jurassic Park conforms to the genre'

Users can see details of any changes along with the IP address or user name of the person responsible. IP addresses are assigned to computers and identify the network they use to access the internet, which allows any editing to be traced, in this case to Whitehall.

In the past two days alone, the names of band members in Hatful Of Rain were added, an Elton John page had a song title corrected and a list of Horrible History episodes was updated.

Changes were also made to the page about Roy ‘Chubby’ Brown and Jurassic Park. Pages on Shirley Valentine, curry, the SAS and presenter Des Lynam were also altered.

In the past month there have also been at least 15 changes to webpages for Scottish football clubs.

Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said last night: ‘Taxpayers aren’t paying Whitehall mandarins to edit interesting websites, they’re paying them to help run the country.

‘The clue is in the name; civil servants are there to serve civil society, not to take it easy when they’re in the office. Taxpayers won’t be impressed.’

Although anyone can, in theory, contribute to Wikipedia, the site has a number of volunteer administrators who can remove false or inappropriate content.

The content can be flagged up by other users for an administrator to judge whether it should be removed. A central committee appoints these moderators and senior editors.

A Government spokesman said last night: ‘Civil servants are required to follow the Civil Service Code when working online.’
