The views are breathtaking but it hardly seems to be the safest place to sit at the best of times.

Yet these walkers dangling their legs over a drop of several hundred feet don’t seem to mind the added risk – a huge crack in the cliff edge.

And the holidaymakers on the beach seem oblivious to the dangers, too. For the cliffs at Birling Gap, near Eastbourne, East Sussex, are known to be crumbling.

The Birling Cliffs, near Eastbourne, have seen seven years' worth of erosion in six months after winter storms battered them. However walkers seem content to ignore warnings in place as they dangle their feet off the top

Vast chunks have regularly fallen and the 30ft-long crack in the pictures appeared earlier this year, after winter storms caused seven years’ worth of erosion in only two months.

However that wasn’t putting off the many visitors enjoying the sunshine this week who were more than happy to sit near – or under – the crack.

One onlooker said: ‘Bits of these cliffs regularly fall off, and I couldn’t believe people’s devil-may-care attitude.

‘They didn’t seem to realise that the ground beneath them could just disappear in a second. It’s very high up and they were brazen sitting next to these massive cracks in the ground.’

Walkers along the beach are content to stroll underneath the giant chalk cliffs, despite the fact that they could fall down on top of them at any moment
