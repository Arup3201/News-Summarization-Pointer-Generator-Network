Forget saying 'cheese', this loved-up man was looking for a 'yes'.

Tyne Owen from New South Wales sprung a rather elaborate wedding proposal on his girlfriend, Jamie Sheumack, during a Christmas photo session.

A video of the grand gesture - watched more than two million times - shows the couple sat front row as they pose for a festive snap with friends stood behind them.

Nine of the subjects wear lettered T-shirts spelling 'MERRY XMAS'. 

Unbeknown to Miss Sheumack, for the second photo,  the 'E' and 'A' swap places and the 'X' and 'S' cover their vests with sparkly hearts to create 'MARRY ME'.

No idea: She is gobsmacked when she sees the question displayed in the second photo

Excitement: Covering her face with her hands and getting increasingly red, she lets out a squeal 

Another man then opens up his Christmas jacket to add a '?' to the phrase.

Mr Owen tries to calm her down by fanning the air in front of her, with little joy.

If the ring fits: Mr Owen tries to calm her down by fanning the air in front of her, with little joy - 'Will you marry me?' he asks grinning

Spouses-to-be: The happy couple got engaged last Christmas and are still arranging wedding plans

'Will you marry me?' he asks grinning.

Miss Sheumack accepts his offer and stands sobbing as he slips a sparkly engagement ring on her finger.

The spouses-to-be then embrace with everyone else in the room watching on. 

Getting the engagement party going, Mr Owen changes the music from Somewhere Over The Rainbow to Come On Eileen.
