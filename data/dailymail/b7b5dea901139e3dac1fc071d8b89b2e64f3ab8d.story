A grandfather died as he saved his 15-month-old grandson's life by stopping him falling to the bottom of a 30ft well.

Duan Shuyo, 59, grabbed hold of youngster Lu as he plunged through a crack in the ground during a night-time walk and rescued him with his dying breath.

He died while stuck holding the toddler but continued to hold him in his 'death grip'.

Rescuers pull the body of Duan Suuyo free after he died while stopping his grandson from falling through a well

The grandfather grabbed the youngster by the shoulders as he slipped down but was pulled in to the gap and became wedged

The pair were not found until the following morning and the young boy was still clutched in his grandfather's hands.

They had gone for a stroll near the family home in Shenzhuang, Henan province, central China, to cool off from the 35 degree temperatures.

As they were walking, Lu slipped into the gap next to the well.

His grandfather grabbed hold of the boy by his shoulders and was then pulled into the hole head first until his chest was wedged in the gap.

Lu, who is just 15-months-old, was finally rescued after a night of being trapped in the gap

The little boy survived with only a minor scratches and bruises and now recovering with his parents

Paramedics believe he had died of a heart attack in the night during the ordeal.

However, a muscle spasm and rigor mortis meant that he still held onto the boy.

Police say Lu survived the fall with minor cuts and bruises and is now recovering with his parents.

'His grandfather literally saved him with his dying breath,' said one.

Rescuers had to dig under the gap to rescue the little boy, who was eventually carried to the surface under a blanket.
