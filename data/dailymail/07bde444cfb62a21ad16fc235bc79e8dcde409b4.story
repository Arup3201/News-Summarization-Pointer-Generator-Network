The latest hot prospect to come out of Barcelona showed there is no end to the talent with a brilliant individual goal. 

South Korean teenager Seung-Woo Lee is currently competing for his country in the Asian Under-16 Championships in Thailand and lit up his country's clash with Malaysia.  

Picking the ball up just inside Malaysia's half, he wriggles between two players before skipping away from a couple of despairing sliding tackles. 

Still with plenty to do, Lee lifts the ball over the feet of a fifth Malaysian defender before slamming the ball into the bottom corner on the half volley from just inside the penalty area. 

The wonderkid joined Barca's famous La Masia academy three years ago and big things are expected of him.

Skilful: Despite some desperate challenges none of the defenders can stop Lee 

Back of the net: The starlet finished off the run with a powerful right foot half volley 

Starlet Lee has already been linked with moves to Liverpool and Chelsea in the Premier League and he has already been christened 'the Korean Messi' for his likeness to Barcelona legend Lionel Messi. 

And he actually outperformed Messi at under-15 level for the Spanish club, bagging 38 goals in just 29 games compared with the Argentine's 37 in 30,
