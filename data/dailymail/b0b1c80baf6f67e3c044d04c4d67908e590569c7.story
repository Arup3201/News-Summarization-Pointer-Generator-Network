As Selma prepared to commemorate the 50th anniversary of 'Bloody Sunday,' so too did the Ku Klux Klan who've distributed almost 4,000 fliers of the organization's hate-literature to area homes over the last two weeks. 

Robert Jones, the grand dragon for the Loyal White Knights of the KKK confirmed the campaign in press interviews. 

'We pretty much put out fliers, some against King and some against immigration,' he told reporters. 'It's time for the American people to wake up to these falsehoods that they preach about MLK.'

At AL.com, Jones went on to claims bags with the flier and a rock - the latter meant as paperweight - were thrown at people's homes from passing cars. 

Meanwhile thousands came to Selma to walk over the Edmund Pettus Bridge to honor the battle between police and civil rights leaders. 

'Everybody has a right to gather in this country, freedom of speech,' he said of the Selma gathering, adding that the marchers commemorating Martin Luther King, Jr.'s work and legacy were 'supporting a man they don't know about.'

'The Klan is still out there and we are watching,' he said, hoping that the fliers would attract new members. 

However several of the people living on Selma Avenue took that as a threat, and called the police.
