Carla Maclean, 19, said she fears she will 'drop dead' after being diagnosed with a hole in her heart three years ago

A teenager who has a hole in her heart
 says she has been refused an operation to fix it on the Health Service –
 unless she has a heart attack.

Carla Maclean, 19, has faced an agonising wait for surgery since being diagnosed with the condition three years ago.

Despite
 the procedure being routinely available for children and the elderly, 
she has been told she must fund the £16,000 operation herself, unless 
she has a heart attack or stroke.

Miss
 Maclean, who regularly has palpitations and breathlessness, fears she 
could die before she is allowed to have the operation.

She
 said: ‘I’m just going to be sitting around waiting for something bad to
 happen. I was really shocked when they told me. When we went for the 
meeting I thought the specialist was going to give me a date for the 
operation, not tell me I couldn’t have it.’

The computer graphics apprentice, who has been off work for two months, added: ‘If I was younger or older, the NHS would do it.

‘The
 NHS will only fund it  if I have a heart attack or a  stroke. That 
could leave long-term  damage, or could even be life threatening.

‘I’m worried I may drop dead  if I exercise or do anything too strenuous. I can’t get on with  normal life.’

Miss
 Maclean, from Abbeydale, Gloucestershire, developed problems three 
years ago when doctors found a small hole between the left and right 
atria of her heart during a routine check-up.

But despite bouts of breathlessness, palpitations and headaches, she was told there was nothing the NHS could do.

Cardiologists
 advised her that a private procedure was the only way to guarantee her 
health, at a minimum price of £16,000. She needs a procedure called a 
‘closure of a patent foramen ovale’, where a catheter is used to place a
 permanent implant in her heart which will close the hole.

The 19-year-old, pictured with her boyfriend Chris Prout, said doctors have said a £16,000 operation to close the hole and treat her is not available on the NHS. She suffers breathlessness and palpitations

Miss
 Maclean, who is trying to raise money to have the operation privately, 
is believed to be suffering ‘mini’ strokes, but such an episode would 
have to be classed as ‘major’ before she will be given the operation on 
the NHS. The only treatment she has received so far is blood-thinning 
aspirin.

She said: ‘My 
consultant said to me that because of my age there are no studies about 
the effects of a hole in the heart on my age group.

‘He
 said all the symptoms and problems are not proven to have been caused 
by [the hole] so there is no information to back up funding an 
operation.’

Yesterday a 
spokesman for her regional branch of NHS England said: ‘[The procedure] 
is not routinely commissioned by the NHS and would only be considered if
 the case is deemed exceptional by the individual’s clinician. NHS 
England have not received an application regarding this case.’
