This chubby dog is shedding the pounds thanks to a 'doggy fat camp' which aims to get obese pets into shape.

Lola, the dachshund, is like America's other 37 million obese dogs, the equivalent of 52 per cent of the country's pooch population. 

But to combat the worrying trend, new weight-loss spas are springing up across the country to help the plump pups slim down to a normal weight through exercise.

At the Morris Animal Inn, in Morristown, New Jersey, dogs get to run on treadmills, jump hurdles, swim laps in the pool and even take part in doggy yoga in a bid to lose weight.

The spacious 25,000-square-foot facility is a family run business - passed down through three generations.

Its goal is to improve the health of overweight dogs, who suffer increased risk of diabetes and heart disease.

The poster dog for the Morris Animal Inn is four-year-old Lola - a dachshund who packed on the extra pounds by overeating.

This
 fat dog once tipped the scales at 28lb and now, through regular visits 
to the facility, has slimmed down to 22 lbs, although she still has a long 
way to go.

Debra Montgomery from Morris Animal Inn said: 'More and more pets that come in are overweight so we decided to start the exercise program in 2009 to help our clients.

The Morris Animal Inn in New Jersey has been offering exercise programmes for dogs since 2009

'There 
could be a lot of reasons why pets are overweight. Nowadays, everyone is
 very busy; they're working or maybe don't have time.

'So that's where we come in and do it for them. Our goal is to have those pets be healthy, happy, and go home tired.'

Doggy exercise programs range from the 'Olympian,' at a daily rate of about $100, to the 'Athlete,' at about $40 a day.

Some of the programs are more focused on exercise while others are more of a pampering session in a luxury spa.
