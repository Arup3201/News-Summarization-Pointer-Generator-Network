Controversy over police use of Tasers erupted again last night after the death of a man shot during an alleged burglary.

The raid suspect is the second person in two months to die after being Tasered by police officers.

He was shot with a 50,000-volt stun gun in the early hours of yesterday after reports of a break-in at flats in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire.

Death: A man has died after being shot with a Taser stun gun by police at a home in Newcastle-under-Lyme

Investigation: The incident came after the man apparently tried to burgle a house early this morning

He was bundled into a police car, but soon became ‘unresponsive’ and died hours later in custody following emergency treatment.

Last month Matthew Williams, 34, died after being shot with a stun gun following a horrific attack on Cerys Yemm at a hostel for the homeless. Miss Yemm was allegedly murdered by Williams who ‘ate her face while high on cocaine’ in Caerphilly, South Wales. Police discharged the Taser after finding the 22-year-old unconscious with severe facial injuries.

Solicitor Sophie Khan, from the Police Action Centre, has now called on Theresa May to consider a temporary ban on Tasers. She said stun guns are a ‘real threat to life and their use must now be curbed’.

Yesterday officers remained on guard outside the flat, which neighbours say is occupied by a ‘hard-working’ couple in their twenties and their baby boy.

Neighbour Mark Finney, 50, said: ‘I was asleep and at around 1.30am, I woke up and heard shouting and tremendous banging. It sounded like someone was in distress.’

A 22-year-old local resident, who did not want to be named, said he heard the Taser victim shout ‘help me’ after the stun gun was fired at around 1.45am. He added: ‘There were seven or eight police and I saw them dragging this bloke out.

‘He was still alive then but he looked like he was drunk or something. They were carrying him with their arms under his shoulders. They bunged him in the back of the van.’ Staffordshire Police, which deploys Tasers more than any other force in the country, has now been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which will investigate the death. 

Probe: The Independent Police Complaints Commission will be investigating the man's death

Quiet: The incident took place in the suburb of Chesterton just outside Newcastle-under-Lyme

An IPCC report revealed in July that Staffordshire officers had used Tasers as ‘a deterrent’ 619 times in the past nine years.

Between 2012 and 2013, the force fired stun guns a total of 71 times – more than three times more than similar-sized forces such as Leicestershire and West Mercia Police.

The weapons have been linked to at least ten deaths in England and Wales over the past decade.

Staffordshire’s police and crime commissioner Matthew Ellis said it was ‘immensely sad’ that a man had lost his life, but added that it would be inappropriate to comment further during an ongoing IPCC investigation.
