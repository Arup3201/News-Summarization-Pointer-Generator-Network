The wife of deceased former mob-boss John Gotti has been hospitalized after suffering what was reportedly a 'very serious' stroke. It is the third stroke mob matriarch Victoria Gotti has suffered since 2006.

Gotti's condition is unknown - she reportedly suffered the stroke last week and her family is requesting privacy in regards to her condition.

Gotti and the former Gambino boss were 
married in 1962, when the future 'Teflon Don' was just a small-time 
street thug.

By 1985, John Gotti was running one of the largest criminal
enterprises in the world after organizing the gangland slaying of then 
Gambino-boss Paul Castellano outside of a bustling Manhattan steak 
house.

John and Victoria Gotti had five children - Angel, Victoria, John, Frank and Peter. Frank Gotti was killed on March 18, 1980, when Gotti neighbor John Favara ran the 12-year-old boy over with his car.

The incident was ruled an accident, but when Favara visited the Gottis to offer his condolences, Victoria Gotti attacked him with a baseball bat. In July of 1980, Favara was abducted and never heard from again. He was presumed murdered in a hit ordered by Gotti - an allegation John Gotti Jr. has said is 'probable.'

Of all the Gotti children, John Jr. is the only one to follow his father into a life of crime. By 1982, John Jr. already had become a Gambino Family 'associate,' and by 1990 he had been named a 'capo' in the organization.

In regards to her son's career with the mob, Victoria Gotti told the New York Daily News in 2006 that she felt 'betrayed' that her husband had dragged their son into a life of crime.

'I pretty much raised my children alone with Johnny being away for years at a time, so it broke my heart. I felt betrayed, the worst betrayal. I would rather have dealt with other women,' she told the paper.

The Gottis' daughter Victoria starred in the A&E reality TV series Growing Up Gotti, which chronicled the lives of the former mafia don's grandchildren Carmine, John and Frank. The series was canceled in 2005 after 41 episodes.
