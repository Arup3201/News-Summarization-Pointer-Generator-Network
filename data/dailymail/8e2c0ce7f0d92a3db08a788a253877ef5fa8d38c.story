This is the moment a jaguar was captured diving from the top of a river bank in an attempt to catch a giant river otter.

After spotting a family of otters travelling noisily downstream, the sharp-eyed predator is seen stealthily making its way across the top of an 26ft river bank.

Noticing the youngest and smallest of the group trailing behind, the fearless feline decided to make the most of its vantage point by launching into the water head first.

This is the moment a jaguar was captured diving from the top of a river bank in an attempt to catch a river otter

But it seems that this is one big cat that might still needs a few diving lessons as the lucky otter managed to slip beneath the brown mirky water of the Cuiaba River in Brazil.

Captured by Irish photographer, David Jenkins, 41, the mammals can be heard calling loudly to their youngest member of the family.

Mr Jenkins said: 'The jaguar was resting when it heard the noisy otters making their way down river, it watched them pass by below until he selected his target which was one of the younger otters at the back.

'They were moving close to the river bank as they travelled and the big cat obviously saw a good opportunity and went for it.

The jaguar takes a leap of faith into the water to ambush the youngest otter managed to make a quick escape

'It really was an incredible leap, I'd say the riverbank was around 8 metres high and it just launched at the otter head first.

'The jaguars are very confident in the water and often ambush prey jumping from the riverbanks.

'All the otter family survived this time, once they saw the predator they didn't hang around, the current in the water was very strong so they were able to make a very quick escape downriver.

'In the video you can hear them making loud noises, they came back to make sure none of their group was taken and to give an alarm that they have seen the predator, the otters are tough animals and can measure almost two metres long.

'I think maybe the jaguar was frustrated but only briefly, I guess he knew he had just missed a good opportunity to make a kill.

'You need to be extremely lucky to be in the right place at the right time to see it, but a large part of being able to photograph incredible action such as this one is due to great safari guides as well as a lot of patience.

'I couldn't believe my luck, I guess this is one of those rare moments all wildlife photographers dream of but rarely get to see.'
