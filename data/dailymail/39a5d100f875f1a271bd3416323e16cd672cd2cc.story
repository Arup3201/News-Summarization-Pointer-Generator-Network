Arrested: Yonathan Melaku, a Lance Corporal Marine corps reservist who lives in Virginia and is Muslim, is being investigated for suspicious behavior

Yonathan Melaku, a Lance Corporal Marine Corps reservist who lives in Alexandria, Virginia and is Muslim, has been identified as the suspect arrested less than a mile from the Pentagon.

Mr Melaku, 22, was taken into custody early Friday under suspicion that he posed a potential terrorist threat to the Pentagon, a highly sensitive site in the post-9/11 world.

At first, media reported police 'found ammonium nitrate, ammunition and al Qaeda literature' in his car, which was parked in bushes near the Pentagon.

Later, FBI Special Agent Brenda Heck told reporters: No explosives were found in the vehicle, a red 2007 Nissan.

A backpack the detained man was carrying held bags labelled 'ammonium nitrate' and filled with five pounds of material. But upon investigation, it turned out to be 'non-explosive unknown material', according to Ms Heck.

Ms Heck would not confirm earlier reports that he was carrying a notebook that included phrases related to Al Qaeda.

U.S. Park Police spokesman Sgt. David
 Schlosser said the man was in nearby Arlington National Cemetery 
overnight, when it is closed, triggering an investigation.

In the course of interviewing the man, police were directed to a car, he said.

Mr Schlosser said: 'This is an unfolding situation'.

He added that the proximity of the car to the Pentagon made the situation more suspicious. The building was not been evacuated, though roads in the area were closed this morning as a precaution and to ease the investigation.

Since the start of the recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. military has worked hard to recruit more Muslims, in order to make a more diverse and culturally aware fighting force.

However, the military has also wrestled with concerns over the potential for extremist views, especially in the wake of a few high-profile incidents.

Military personnel are not asked to disclose their religion. Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, the accused gunman of the Fort Hood shootings of November 2009, had not listed a religion on his official forms.

The alleged gunman reportedly shouted 'Allahu Akbar!' (God is greatest) and opened fire on soldiers at the fort in Texas, killing 13 people and wounding 30.

In April 2003, Army Sgt. Hasan Akbar, a convert to Islam, rolled a grenade into a tent filled with soldiers, killing two and wounding 14 others. Sgt. Akbar, who was sentenced to death, said he feared the U.S. military would kill Muslim civilians during the war.

Although Muslim soldiers can often get substantial signing bonuses, especially if they possess language skills or cultural knowledge likely to be useful abroad, many do adopt non-Muslim names out of fear of reprisal by extremists.

The army hired its first Muslim chaplain in 1994 and builts its first permanent mosque, the Masjid al Da'Wah facility at Virginia's Norfolk Navy Base, in 1998.

Pentagon police spokesman Chris Layman said the car was in bushes near the Pentagon's north parking lot. 

Mr Layman at first said one or two other people may have been involved, but the latest reports suggest that may be unlikely.

Ms heck said, 'There was not a device'.
She added that authorities believe the man acted alone, and is in his mid-20s.

This morning, police were investigating a suspicious package in the vehicle, said a U.S. official familiar with the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation was still under way.

Early reports had said police believed he was carrying ammonium nitrate - which can be used in bombs - and spent ammunition for
 an automatic weapon. 

Mr Melaku is a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Ethiopia, according to reports.

He reportedly joined the Marines as a reservist in 2007 or 2008, but military officials say he never deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan.

According to the Leesburg Police Department, Mr Melaku was arrested last month for breaking into 27 cars at around 3:30 a.m. on May 26 in Leesburg, Virginia.

He is said to be facing charges related to that alleged incident.

Authorities said Mr Melaku does not appear to have known ties to any terror organization.

According to ABC, public records list Mr Melaku as living with relatives in a nearly 
half-million dollar home in a small private community in Alexandria.

Officials say one man is under arrest after they found his car, parked in the bushes near the Pentagon, contained material that appears to be ammonium nitrate, ammunition and 'al Qaeda' literature

Police say they are still searching the area for one or two other persons of interest, who may be involved

Neutralized: Police say suspicious material in a suspect's car near the Pentagon has been 'neutralized'

According to law enforcement sources, the man is a naturalized U.S. 
citizen. Initially he was thought to be of Ethiopian ethnicity.

Early reports said police said they found a notebook that contained mostly notes for a
 financial class, but also a page containing words 'al qaeda, 'Taliban rules', 'mujahidin  and 'defeated coalition forces'.

The man allegedly told police that there were other 'devices' in the area and also the location of a vehicle.

In another incident earlier this week, a motorist found with a gun and what appeared to be a suspicious package near the Pentagon was taken into custody.

No charges have yet been filed against the detained man.

According to Mr Schlosser, the detained man 'wasn't forthcoming' about who he was or what he was doing in 
the cemetery after midnight.
