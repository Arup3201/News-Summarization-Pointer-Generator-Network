Wayne Rooney scored on his return to the Manchester United attack as Louis van Gaal’s side survived an FA Cup upset at Preston Monday night to set up a quarter-final clash at home to Arsenal.

The England captain, who has been forced to play in midfield recently by Van Gaal, completed United’s 3-1 comeback victory by winning and converting a late penalty to end a scoring drought that had lasted 952 minutes.

It sparked a debate over whether Rooney had dived, with Preston boss Simon Grayson insisting there had been no contact between the United star and his goalkeeper Thorsten Stuckmann, and also claiming that Rooney was offside when Ander Herrera scored the equaliser.

Grayson said: ‘Wayne Rooney has not been touched by the goalkeeper. Yes he has had to jump out of the way but he has not been touched. I’m not saying it wasn’t a penalty, I’m saying there was no contact. You can interpret that how you want.

‘It wasn’t a dive. He has gone to get out of the way and take evasive action. I’ m not complaining.

‘The first one, he is close to interfering with our goalkeeper. It’s a grey area. He wasn’t directly in his line, he was just to the side.

‘The second goal, Tom Clarke was pushed by Fellaini. It is a slight push but sometimes they go for you, sometimes they don’t.

‘But the players can wake up in the norming and be very proud of what they have done. I certainly am. Full credit to the players, they have come up against one of the top teams in the world and United know they were in a game.’

United will face Arsenal at Old Trafford on March 7 or 8, and Van Gaal praised his players’ character after they went behind to Scott Laird’s opener.

‘The most important thing is that we have a draw at home,’ said the Dutchman. ‘I have to give to all the credit to the players because they have done again everything and the spirit in the team is unbelievable.’

There were also claims that Rooney was offside when Ander Herrera's shot trickled into the net (above)
