Michael Buble's Argentine wife, Luisana Lopilato celebrated her last ever Ultimo campaign last week as she retired to focus on motherhood.

But hot on the heels of her exit, the lingerie giant has already announced her replacement - and it's none other than Abbey Clancy.

The model and Strictly Come Dancing star has been unveiled as the new face and body of the brand and will star in its SS14 campaign, which will be revealed early 2014.

Welcome to the family! Ultimo Founder Michelle Mone OBE (L) is delighted to announce Abbey Clancy as the new 'face and body' of her lingerie brand

The 27-year-old will showcase an enhanced ‘Miracle Solutions’ range 
and brand new fashion lines, which cater for women from A through to DD 
cups.

The campaign will also coincide with the launch of Ultimo’s new 
website, and will be supported by robust marketing activity, say the brand.

Speaking about the new appointment, Michelle Mone OBE, founder of Ultimo, said: 'I’m delighted to announce that Abbey is the new face and body of Ultimo.

A taste of what's the come? The campaign will be rolled out next year. Here, Abbey showcases her modelling skills in a Virgin Media On Demand campaign in 2010

'She’s a modern beauty, feminine and fashion-forward, which perfectly reflects our forthcoming Spring/Summer collection.'

Speaking about her latest modelling gig, mother-of-one Abbey said: 'It’s really exciting to be part of such an established brand at such an exciting time.

'I absolutely love the Ultimo product – it’s so wearable and feels amazing on the body!

'I can’t wait until the Spring/Summer campaign is revealed next year, and to work with Michelle and her team.'

Ultimo’s heritage is built on enhancing the female form, with a specific focus on cleavage boosting and uplift.

The
 brand’s very first design, the ‘OMG Plunge Bra’ with in-built silicone,
 was worn by Julia Roberts to create her cleavage in Erin Brockovich.

Since then, Ultimo has seen the likes of Mel B, Penny Lancaster, Rachel Hunter and Sarah Harding pose for them.Bowing out: New mother Luisana Lopilato poses for Ultimo lingerie in her last shoot for the brand

Michelle added: 'It is very exciting times for Ultimo. We’ve made major improvements to our product and taken a more directional approach.

'Abbey’s first Ultimo shoot will reflect this change in direction, further cementing Ultimo’s position as one of the UK’s best loved lingerie brands.'

Busy Abbey, who is married to England footballer Peter Crouch, is currently preparing to compete in the all-female Strictly final alongside her dance partner, Aljaz Skorjanec.

They'll join Sophie Ellis-Bextor and 
Susanna Reid in the all-important climax, while Natalie Gumede survived a dance 
off with Patrick Robinson during a recent eviction to dance again for the 
Strictly trophy.
