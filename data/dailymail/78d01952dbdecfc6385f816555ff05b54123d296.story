Rhythm isn't something most babies are born with. But this one - which is yet to be born - seems to have it in abundance.

In this incredible video of an ultrasound scan, the 14-week-old foetus appears to clap its hands together, as the mother sings If You're Happy And You Know It Clap Your Hands. 

The baby clapping in its mother's womb has been rewound to seem like he's clapping to a song

The parents can be heard laughing in the background as the doctor then rewinds the tape to make it look like that baby was clapping along to their singing. 

The 15-second video that was uploaded to YouTube yesterday by Jen Cardinal, who is based in the UK, has already racked up more than 48,000 views.

Under the post, Jen writes: 'At our 14 week ultrasound our baby was clapping, so I sang a song with our doctor as my husband filmed.'

‘The experience is one I’ll never forget. The baby clapped three times, then the doctor rewound and scrubbed it while we sang. No mystery. It was amazing,’ she wrote on YouTube.
