An Arriva bus pulling out on to Trafford Road bridge in Manchester is met by the unusual spectacle of a team of horses dragging carriages of freight.

Meanwhile a modern 4x4 is parked just around the corner from a classic Ford Model T - in trademark black.

These evocative images, showing a bizarre clash of past and present, demonstrate beautifully the way our cities have changed with the passage of time - and the ways they haven't.

Past meets present: This image shows a bus pulling on to Trafford Road Bridge in Salford, blended with a team of three horses and carriages bearing goods from the nearby docks

Classic: This building appears to have remained unchanged, while in the surrounding area modern cars and traffic signs sit incongruously with two classic Ford Model T cars to the right

The march of time: Workers are seen headed in to Manchester Docks in the older picture, while the area is gated off in the present day

Created by Photoshop wizard and local historian Neil Pearson, the collection of images show a blend of scenes past and present in Manchester and Salford.

Mr Pearson, a 46-year-old postal worker, finds eye-catching images showing his home city in bygone days, then takes his own from the exact same vantage.

He then digitally blends the two to create an amalgamation of the past and present in a single image.

He said: 'I don't look for any type of period really, just if a picture catches my eye and I know the area is still roughly the same I’ll see if I can create the image,' said Neil.

Ceremonious: This images superimposes a wedding procession with an everyday pedestrian scene. The two images share an overcast sky

Vintage: An old-time bus and classic cars are seen against the colourful and glass-coated fronts of modern buildings

'I’ll try and position myself in the exact same spot as the original photographer, capturing the same image but adding something modern to it.

'Once I have the current image I use Photoshop to blend the two images together and begin the process of trying to make it look as authentic as possible, which is sometimes easier said than done.'

It sometimes takes days to edit the images to perfection, but Mr Pearson believes that the area around Salford and Manchester has remained largely unchanged.

The city of Salford is home to around 210,000 people, and is one of a number of large settlements just outside of Manchester.

It was an industrial centre in Victorian times, a period which peaked with the construction of the Manchester shipping canal, which forms the border with Manchester proper, in 1894. At the time it was the largest shipping canal in the world.

The city suffered industrial decline throughout the 20th Century, as British manufacturing moved abroad, but has been regenerated in recent years thanks to projects like the BBC's Media City.

Grand: The Adelphi building, now part of the University of Salford, seems much the same now as it did decades ago

Memory lane: This old-fashioned parade of shops has been intruded on by two modern vehicles

He explained: 'The most striking thing I see in my pictures is times change but the area doesn’t.

'In my area at least, a lot the old buildings still remain.

'I’d like to expand this project to other cities as I’m sure every city has its old buildings and streets that still remain.'

Gone: An old-fashioned tram can be seen making its way down this street, while the overhead wires powering it have disappeared in the recent photograph.

Through the looking-glass: The tower blocks seen on the left of the image would have been new in the early picture, while the bright blue footbridge in the background is a striking contrast to the black-and-white surroundings

Continuity: This ornate building pictured here still dominates the scene today
