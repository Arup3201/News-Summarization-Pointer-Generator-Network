Claims: Victoria Wasteney (picture yesterday) launched an employment tribunal against the East London NHS Trust, claiming her employers discriminated against her because of her religion

A Christian health worker has told an employment tribunal that the NHS trust she works for did not clear her of bullying a Muslim colleague because it was 'politically incorrect'.  

Victoria Wasteney, 37, was disciplined for alleged bullying and harassment after Enya Nawaz, 25, told managers that the senior occupational health therapist had tried to convert her to Christianity.

Today, Miss Wasteney launched an employment tribunal against the East London NHS Trust, claiming her employers discriminated against her because of her religion.

Miss Wasteney accused the NHS of making her look like a 'religious nutcase' and said she never attempted to convert Miss Nawaz. 

She told the tribunal that she believed she and Miss Nawaz were friends and alleged Miss Nawaz was 'manipulated' into complaining against her by colleagues who had an anti-Christian agenda. 

Today Miss Wasteney claimed the Trust had failed to clear her of wrongdoing after a nine-month disciplinary process because it would be 'politically incorrect' to find a Christian innocent.

The Trust insists the disciplinary hearing was fair and they deny they discriminated against Miss Wasteney.

Miss Wasteney told the East London Employment Tribunal that her professional career 'had been jeopardised, her reputation damaged and relations with colleagues ruined.

She added: 'I was subjected to an ordeal of persecution dressed as a "disciplinary action" for an extraordinarily long time.

'All this was a result of a manifestly false complaint and it was obvious I had done nothing wrong. I was discriminated against because of my faith.'

Miss Wasteney, who describes herself as a born-again Christian, was working at the John Howard Centre, a secure psychiatric hospital in Homerton, East London.

She said she was always careful about discussing her religion at work because her managers had warned her it could 'get you in trouble'.

After Miss Nawaz joined the hospital as a newly qualified occupational therapist in 2012, the two women discussed Islam and Christianity, as well as work done by Miss Wasteney's church to campaign against human trafficking.

Miss Wasteney told the Daily Mail this week her colleague had 'definitely initiated' the conversations, before she invited Miss Nawaz to attend church events linked to the anti-trafficking work.

She said Miss Nawaz had then come to her in tears because she was upset about health problems. 

Miss Wasteney said: 'I put my hand on her knee to comfort her and asked if that was okay, and said 'Would you like me to pray for you?'

'She said yes, so I asked for God to bring peace and healing. She left the office afterwards and said she was okay.' 

Miss Wasteney also gave Miss Nawaz a book, I Dared to Call Him Father, about a Muslim woman who converts to Christianity, but denied it was an attempt to make Miss Nawaz convert.

She said she was shocked to learn her junior had made a formal complaint, but said Miss Nawaz had previously told her she had come under pressure from colleagues to do so.

The East London NHS Foundation Trust investigated Miss Nawaz's eight-page complaint in June 2013. Miss Wasteney was suspended on full pay for nine months while the investigation was carried out.

A disciplinary hearing dismissed some of the allegations but upheld three complaints related to the book, the invitation to church events and Miss Wasteney's offer to pray for Miss Nawaz.

It ruled that the episodes amounted to misconduct. Miss Wasteney was given a written warning, although she was not sacked and continues to work in another area of the trust.  

The claimant told the court she had been previously investigated by the Trust because of her involvement in the Discover Life Group, a Christian group for service users.

She said although the allegations were 'unsubstantiated,' the process had bred ill feeling among other staff members, who tried to warn Miss Nawaz away from her.

She told the tribunal the compliant was made against this background.

The claimant added: 'There had been a history of pressure being put on her to make a false complaint of this nature by certain people among the staff, probably motivated by religious prejudice.'  

She was suspended on the grounds of 'gross misconduct' - making her feel as though she was already seen as 'guilty' and her boss had been looking for an excuse to investigate her faith. 

A hearing was  held in February 2014, during which the claimant was told there had been a breakdown in the 'firewall' between her personal beliefs and her work, which she said made her faith seem as though it was a 'virus.'

She was given a final written warning as a result, which was later reduced to first written warning on appeal.

The claimant said: 'Despite these concessions, I find the outcome of the appeal unsatisfactory. 

'Harassment and bullying are serious allegations, which were made against me but never substantiated.

'Simply put it was felt to be politically incorrect to find that a Christian was innocent. I am innocent of misconduct at work, and the respondent must acknowledge that.'

She returned to work in March 2014, but said staff were made to see her as a 'religious nutcase' and the 'hostility' she experienced pressured her into changing roles.

Miss Wasteney, who describes herself as a born-again Christian, was working at the John Howard Centre, a secure psychiatric hospital in Homerton, East London (pictured), overseen by the East London NHS Trust 

Ben Collins, representing the East London NHS Trust alleged Miss Wasteney used her senior position to pressurise Miss Nawaz into going to services at the Christian Revival Church.

He told the  tribunal Miss Nawaz had said: 'I had texts from Miss Wasteney about prayer meetings. It is hard to say no to someone so senior.'

He also quoted a series of text messages between the claimant and Miss Nawaz in which she uses the fact she was 'stuck in traffic' as a reason for not being able to make a meeting.

Mr Collins told the tribunal: 'You said, “pray God to hurry you”. Could she have been giving excuses for not wanting to come?'

But Miss Wasteney said she was inviting Miss Nawaz to attend a social event at the church, which met at the O2 centre in North Greenwich, as she would invite a colleague to an exercise class.

Mr Collins told the court after a text message exchange in which Miss Nawaz described how her parents were involved in setting up a mosque in Birmingham, Miss Wasteney had responded: 'Jesus is the one who leads us into truth. I am so excited by what is being stirred in your spirit, making it into His presence is truly life changing.'

He said: 'Part of the case against you is that you are proselytising. Going back to the phrase "Jesus leads us into truth" you can see how your actions might have that effect.' 

The tribunal continues.
