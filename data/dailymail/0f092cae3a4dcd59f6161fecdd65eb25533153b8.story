Senior Constable, Justice and Corporal are names reserved for positions of authority and rank.

But bizarrely, a number of parents have tried to use them as unique names for their beloved newborn babies.

The names were among those rejected in 2014 and join a list of knocked back baby titles including Christ, Lucifer, Royal-Rule, Prince, Princess and Majesty.

Senior Constable, Justice and Corporal are among the bizarre names parents have tried to unsucessfully name their children in 2014

The New Zealand Department of Internal Affairs rejected several names last year that included rank or royal connotations.

But parents who also tried to enter the forward-slash symbol, 3rd and 09 when they registered their child's name were also turned down.

There was one rejection of Senior Constable as a name, one rejection of Corporal, six rejections of Justice and one rejection each of Justyce and Justis.

There was one attempt to name a child Christ.

Under New Zealand law names can be rejected for a limited number of reasons, including that they are unreasonably long, resemble a title or rank, or may be offensive. 

Back in 2008, a nine-year-old girl at the centre of a custody battle was told she should become a ward of the court until she could choose a name she liked. 

Parents who also tried to enter the forward-slash symbol, 3rd and 09 when they registered their child's name were also informed they had been rejected

Her parents had called her Talula Does The Hula From Hawaii.

Family Court Judge Rob Murfitt said at the time: 'The court is profoundly concerned about the very poor judgment which this child's parents have shown in choosing this name. It makes a fool of the child and sets her up with a social disability and handicap, unnecessarily.'

Murfitt cited a list of unfortunate names that he said were embarrassing or made children seem foolish among their peers.

Some names, including Fish and Chips (twins), Yeah Detroit, Stallion, Twisty Poi, Keenan Got Lucy and Sex Fruit, were blocked by registration officials, he said.
