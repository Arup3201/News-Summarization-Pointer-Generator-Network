Police want to speak to this man after two 22-year-old women were attacked near Sydney Road in Brunswick on Saturday

A third woman has been sexually assaulted in the Melbourne suburb of Brunswick, less than a week after two other similar attacks.

In the most recent incident, the woman was grabbed from behind by an unknown man on Hope Street at approximately 8pm on Friday before he tried to sexually assault her, according to Victorian Police.

A passer-by was said to have disturbed the offender, causing him to run away.

No further information has been released to date, but police have mentioned that the latest attack is not suspected to be linked to the earlier assaults.

All three attacks occurred as separate incidents near the scene of Jill Meagherâ€™s brutal 2012 abduction.

The sex predator who attacked two young women last Saturday, told one of his victims it was the first time he had struck, police said.

A 22-year-old woman was dragged into a side street off Sydney Road in the Melbourne suburb of Brunswick at 2.20am on Saturday while she was walking home from a hotel.

The unknown man grabbed her from behind and indecently assaulted her.

She managed to break free and ran back onto Sydney Road where she flagged down a friend who was driving past in a taxi.

Police believe the man assaulted a second woman on nearby Charles Street just minutes later on the same night.

The woman, also 22, was similarly grabbed from behind and wrestled to the ground.

She managed to escape and ran home.

Detective Senior Constable Dean Solomon said both women fought back when they were attacked.

'They have defended themselves so fiercely that in the end I think he has just given up,' he told reporters on Thursday.

'While (one woman) was trying to defend herself, he said that he was homeless and this was the first time that he'd done this sort of thing,' Det Snr Const Solomon added.

Neither of the two women were physically injured during the attacks.

Police have released an image of the man they are looking for.

He has been described as around 180cm tall with a thin build and a fair complexion. He was wearing a dark-coloured or blue hoodie, blue jeans and a t-shirt with a white print on it.

Saturday's attacks happened in close range to where Jill Meagher was last seen on Sydney Road back in 2012

Police say the same man might have also approached other women in the area about the same time.

Jill Meagher was raped and killed as she walked home along Sydney Road in September 2012.

Her attacker, Adrian Bayley,  was on parole at the time of the crime. He was sentenced to life in prison with a 35-year non-parole period in June last year.
