A British citizen has today been sentenced to more than 12 years for terror offences.

Babar Ahmad, of Tooting, West London, admitted supporting terrorists in Afghanistan through websites that backed jihad.

U.S. judge Janet Hall said he had helped enable Osama bin Laden to be protected when he was plotting the September 11 attacks by supporting the Taliban.

But she said Ahmad had no knowledge of the plot and there was no evidence he supported bin Laden's al-Qaida terrorist group.

The judge said: 'You can't walk away from the fact that what you were doing was enabling bin Laden to be protected in Afghanistan and to train the men who actually boarded the flights that drove into the Pentagon and World Trade Center.'

But she imposed a much lower sentence than the 25 years sought by prosecutors, rejecting their claim that he posed a high risk of re-offending.

The sentence will include the ten years Ahmad has already has served, she said.

She also rejected testimony from a government cooperating witness that Ahmad had traveled to Afghanistan.

Babar Ahmad's co-defendant, Syed Talha Ahsan, pictured, is also due to be sentenced and could face up to 15 years in prison

The case did not involve participation in acts of terrorism, and Ahmad showed no interest in doing so even after receiving a document detailing the movements and vulnerabilities of a U.S. Navy battle group, the court, in New Haven, Connecticut heard.

Ahmad pleaded guilty in December to supporting terrorists through websites that sought to raise cash, recruit fighters and solicit items such as gas masks for the Taliban.

Ahmad's attorney has said he publicly condemned the September 11 attacks and deeply regrets his support for the Taliban.

Ahmad says he tried to help Muslims under attack in Bosnia and Chechnya, recalling atrocities he learned about while in Bosnia.

Hall and a prosecutor said his support for the Taliban continued after the September 11 attacks.

Ahmad told the judge he supported the Taliban because it was under attack, not because he supported bin Laden or Al-Qaida.

He said he has read books about pacifist leader Mohandas K. Gandhi, also known as Mahatma Gandhi, and others while in prison and said talks can resolve differences.

'Not every conflict in the world is Bosnia,' said Ahmed, who was extradited to the U.S. in 2012 after an eight year legal battle. He added: 'The world is complicated.'

A co-defendant, Syed Talha Ahsan, was due to be sentenced later on Wednesday. He faces up to 15 years in prison.Â 

The two men, who were extradited from Britain in 2012, faced charges in Connecticut because authorities said they used an Internet service provider in the state to run one of the websites.
