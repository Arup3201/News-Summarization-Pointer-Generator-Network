A man who took his mother's sports car for a joyride mounted the kerb at 70mph before ploughing into a petrol station shop in a £190,000 crash.

David Elly's wheels left the ground moments before the crash, narrowly missing a 35-year-old motorist filling up at the pump.

The Audi TT ended up embedded in the glass front of the BP kiosk as a worker stood behind the counter.

Elly, 24, has been banned from driving for a year and handed a 10-month suspended sentence for crashing his mother's Audi TT

Elly, 24, lost control of the vehicle as he sped down Compstall Road, Romiley, Minshull Street Crown Court heard.

Nobody was injured in the smash.

Former Stockport Grammar School pupil Elly has been spared jail but banned from the road in a court case which heard he could 'spend the rest of his life' trying to pay for the damage he caused.

He admitted charges of aggravated vehicle taking, dangerous driving and driving without insurance at an earlier hearing.

The court heard that Elly, a British Gas complaints advisor, had been left the keys to his mother's Audi TT when she went away to London.

The vehicle was left in the car park of the Forrester's Arms in Romiley, but Elly decided to move it when he learned the pub was to host a function.

But, by the time he got behind the wheel on the evening of August 5 last year, the court heard, he had been drinking and rowing with his girlfriend.

Lisa Boocock, prosecuting, said: 'The man working behind the counter heard the car speeding towards the petrol station and then a loud crash - the car left the floor and embedded itself into the side of the petrol station shop.'

Elly suffered minor injuries and was found to be below the drink-drive limit at the time of the crash.

Gwyn Lewis, defending, said Elly had 'good intentions' when he got behind the wheel.

'He decided to move the car to a suitable place. It was a pleasant afternoon and I suspect in addition the opportunity to drive an Audi TT was something he was tempted by.

Elly walked away uninjured from the crash which caused £190,000 of damage

'Clearly he did not think clearly enough at the time about what he was doing - he says he wants to make a genuine attempt to pay for the damage.'

Sentencing Elly, who has no previous convictions, to a 10-month jail sentence suspended for two years, Judge Maurice Greene said he accepted that the incident was 'completely out of character', and that he did not believe he would come back before the court.

'I have come to the conclusion, with much hesitation, that I do not need to send you immediately to prison - even though there was a considerable amount of damage and people's lives were put in danger,' the judge added.

Ellis is banned from driving for 12 months, must pay £25 costs, do 250 hours of unpaid work, and attend a Probation Service 'New Direction Activity Requirement'.
