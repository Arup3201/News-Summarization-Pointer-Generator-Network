BBC commentator and rugby legend Jonathan Davies has called time on his 12-year marriage to his second wife, Helen.

The 51-year-old is reported to have walked out on his 35-year-old wife, saying they had 'grown apart' and insisting no-else is involved.

Friends say the former dancer has been left stunned by the former Welsh rugby union captain's decision.

One told the Sunday Mirror: 'It is just very sad for both of them. There is no-one else involved, they've just grown apart. Helen is gutted.'

Another said Davies' work commitments, which required him to be away for long periods of time, had put a strain on the marriage.

The couple met in 2001, four years after Davies' first wife, Karen, tragically died from cancer.

Davies, who will appear on the BBC panel covering the Six Nations rugby next month, has three grown-up children - Scott, Grace and Geena - from his marriage to Karen, and a 10-year-old daughter, Molly, from his second marriage.

The international rugby star, known to his fans as Jiffy, reportedly moved from the family home in Llandaff, Cardiff, just before Christmas to a property in the Vale of Glamorgan.
