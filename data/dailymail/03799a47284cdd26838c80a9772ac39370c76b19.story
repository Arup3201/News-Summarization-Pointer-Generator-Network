Swollen limbs, a sore throat, headaches, heavy legs, dehydration, dizziness and exploding ear drums. The symptoms  of flying are enough to make you want to stay at home.

Your body is a finely tuned temple and low oxygen levels,  humidity and sudden changes of pressure can wreak havoc with it. Luckily there are a few things you can do to combat the worst effects of flying. Here's how to take matters into your own hands…

Under pressure

Most planes fly at 35,000 feet where the air is thinner and smoother, but less hospitable for us. At that elevation air pressure is far lower than it is at ground level. As a result, cabins are pressurised to resemble an altitude of roughly 7,000 feet, that's 11 pounds per square inch.

Still, it's the same effect on your body as if you were sitting on top of a mountain for hours at a time and can cause oxygen levels to dive.

That can be a problem for passengers with conditions such as heart or lung disease who should fly with an oxygen concentrator, or not at all. But even the healthiest among us can feel the ill effects of less oxygen after a couple of hours on board.

Lower blood oxygen levels (decreasing to 93 per cent at cruising altitude) cause fatigue and brain fog as well as headaches and dizziness.

What can you do?

1.) If you are worried about the effects of low oxygen levels in blood because of a pre-existing condition consult your GP before flying.

2.) Put down the gin and tonic. Alcohol exacerbates symptoms as it interferes with your cells' metabolism making them less efficient at absorbing oxygen. It can also cause you to dehydrate faster (more on that below).

3.) Give up smoking. Smoking can deplete oxygen levels by up to eight per cent before you've even boarded the flight. Give yourself and your lungs a fighting chance  by ditching tobacco well in advance of your flight.

4.) Travel on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner which has higher air pressure and humidity levels than other jetliners, a lower cabin altitude of 6,000 ft and fewer pollutants. Many airlines now use the aircraft, check SeatGuru before booking to see if your flight does.

John Greenlee, flight planning director at Houston-based Continental Airlines says, 'On flights of eight, 10 or more hours, we think people will arrive feeling fresher.'

Sitting ducks

We all know that sitting for extended periods in painfully upright, narrow chairs is uncomfortable, but it can also be dangerous, especially for older passengers who suffer poor circulation. 

The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) warns: 'Being seated for a long time, such as on flights longer than about four hours, may increase the risk of developing blood clots in the veins in your legs (also known as deep vein thrombosis or DVT).' 

It also doesn't help blood oxygen levels as blood pools in your legs and feet, preventing efficient circulation of oxygenated blood around the body and brain causing more dizziness and even fainting.

What can you do?

1.) The CAA recommends walking up and down the aisles and doing small exercises (airlines often provide exercise information in their in-flight magazines or entertainment systems) to boost blood flow.

2.) Compression stockings help prevent blood collecting in the lower limbs and uncomfortable swelling.

3.) The Aviation Health Institute recommends taking low-dose aspirin (100 – 150 mg) the day before flying, during the flight and for three days after to improve blood flow by thinning the blood and making it less likely to clot.

4.) Wear loose fitting clothing in breathable fabrics which won't constrict veins or blood flow and keep you from over heating.

Ready for landing

Pressure inside the cabin fluctuates as the plane lands. To the average passenger that will feel equivalent to descending at  roughly 350 feet a minute, as you drop from the pressurised cabin level of 7,000 feet to zero in about twenty minutes.

As a result your ears pop and can hurt like hell. The reason? Eustachian tubes inside the ear are opening and closing, trying to balance and match the changing pressure inside your ear with that outside your head.

If you have a cold the effects will be more painful as these tubes won't be able to open or close as easily and the eardrum will bulge inwards. Worst case scenario, your eardrum could rupture.

What can you do?

1.) Chew, yawn, suck sweets or swallow to open the Eustachian tubes.

2.) Failing that, try the Valsalva manoeuvre, named after Antonio Maria Valsalva, a seventeenth century physician who obsessed over ears and pioneered the technique. Hold your nose, keep your mouth shut and forcefully exhale.

3.) Make sure you are awake during landing ready to do both points above.

4.) Take a prescription decongestant or antihistamine on the day of and before flying.

5.) Buy air pressure-regulating ear plugs which slow the rate of air pressure on the ear drum.

Dryness

The air you breathe in an airplane is sucked in from the outside. It flows through the engine, then gets compressed, cooled, filtered, and pumped into the cabin. At high altitudes, that can make the plane environment drier than a desert as it contains 66 per cent less water than at sea level.

The Association of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends humidity at between 30 and 64 per cent for humans to be comfortable. In an aircraft, it can drop to two per cent.

On short flights this amounts to dry mouth and nose and on longer flights can mean headaches, dizziness, susceptibility to infection and dehydration.

What can you do?

1.) Fly on crowded flights. It sounds horrible but moisture from other passengers' breathing and perspiration can increase the relative humidity dramatically, according to the CAA. 'In the instance of an eight-hour flight in a CD-10 with 265 passengers, the humidity level can rise to 20 percent; the same flight with only 108 passengers sees this level fall to 2 per cent,' they say. 

2.) Budget flights don't have free water on tap. Buy a bottle once you've gone through security and take it on board with you instead. 

Wellness manager and nutritionist at Grace Belgravia, Katie Greenall, says,'It is tough to get the balance right, you want to remain hydrated but don't want to drink so much that you are constantly queuing for the loo. A good indication of adequate hydration is having smooth, hydrated lips. I would advise between one and two cups of water per hour.'

The more the merrier: moisture from other passengers' breathing and perspiration can increase humidity

3.) Avoid alcohol or caffeinated drinks which can act as diuretics making you dehydrate faster.

4.) Contact lens wearers: Keep a bottle of solution (under 100ml, of course) in your hand luggage and remove lenses early to avoid discomfort later on as they shrivel against your eyeball. Use the solution to rejuvenate tired eyes and lenses throughout the flight.
