Robbie Neilson was highly critical of a tackle from Livingston captain Jason Talbot which left Sam Nicholson needing stitches on puncture marks on his face.

The home skipper provided the biggest flashpoint of an eventful game at the Energy Assets Arena right on the stroke of half-time.

With Hearts 1-0 up, Talbot was lucky not to be sent off for a high tackle that ended Nicholson’s game.

Livvy levelled through Craig Sives but new signing Kenny Anderson - Nicholson’s replacement - nodded the visitors back in front with eight minutes to go.

Jamie Walker then got what proved to be the winner as substitute Billy King provided his second assist of the day, before a late Kyle Jacobs penalty proved to be a consolation.

Tynecastle manager Neilson was delighted with the final result, but less pleased with Talbot’s careless challenge.

He said: ‘Sam is going to be OK, but he has three or four puncture marks on his face. It wasn’t a great tackle and I’ve let the referee know my views on it.

‘The games from now until the end of the season are going to be really tough, tense and tight. We are playing against teams who are desperate to beat us.

‘Livingston played really well. We didn’t play great football but we were patient. Genero’s goal was first-class and Billy is a great player to bring on.’

Hearts are now 19 points clear of Rangers in the Championship table, albeit having played three games more than the Ibrox side. And although this match turned into a slog, it edged them closer to the title they now seem destined to claim.

Neilson’s side went ahead after four minutes when a wayward cross-field pass was intercepted by Walker and he cleared upfield, releasing Zeefuik.

The Dutchman could have squared back inside for the onrushing Walker but took too long and found himself pushed out wide.

Undeterred, he showed explosive pace to cut past Calum Fordyce and bend a terrific strike inside Darren Jamieson’s far post.

And after that Talbot tackle led to a skirmish that rendered two other bookings - with eight coming in total - Livvy equalised early in the second half when Sives headed in.

The league leaders were slow to respond and the home side looked dangerous but Hearts eventually regained the initiative through Anderson’s glancing header from King’s cross.

King then teed-up Walker, who finished well from 15 yards, before Brad McKay brought down Myles Hippolyte seconds after coming on to concede a penalty.

He was promptly sent off and Jacobs dispatched the spot-kick but it wasn’t enough to salvage a point.

Dutchman Anderson was thrilled to get a goal his late Hearts-supporting grandad Jim would have enjoyed.

He said: ‘I looked up to my granddad after I scored and he would have been cheering that one.

‘Everybody in the family will be proud and I’ve had loads of texts since joining the club from the Anderson clan.

‘I was happy to make my debut and I was fortunate to get a goal. You always dream of being important to the team on your first appearance.’
