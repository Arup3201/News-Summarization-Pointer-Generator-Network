A woman has found a three foot boa constrictor in the boot of a second hand car she bought online.

Charlie Wise from Thatcham, in Berkshire, saw the Volkswagen Golf advertised on a social networking site and bought it for £200.

She had taken it home to clean and lifted the boot where she and husband Guy Wise noticed what they thought was a rubber toy curled up in the back.

The three-foot long boa constrictor was found in the boot of the second hand car by Charlie Wise in Berkshire

At first Mrs Wise thought it was a rubber toy but when it stuck tongue out she realised it was a real snake

But when it flicked its tongue in and out they realised it was in fact real and slammed the boot and ran away.

The 23-year-old nursery worker said: ‘I bought a car come home to clean it out as right mess to find a huge live snake in the boot.

‘It’s huge and scary.’

‘We screamed and slammed the boot.’

After both the police and RSPCA said they were unable to help until morning, Mrs Wise called the  Berkshire Reptile Rescue, at Bracknell, and specialist Grahame Martin came out to take the snake away.

Mrs Wise added: ' We called him after RSPCA and police very late at night coem and meet us to take the snake off us, and he got it out the boot of the car.

'The snake was in a very poor condition. It was highly dehydrated, and blind in one of its eyes. He is now taking care of all of its treatment.

'I think he is a credit  - he is the only bloke in our area who does this sort of thing and he really helped us out. Without him I would have to keep a snake in my house all night. He deserves all the credit for this rescue.'

She rang the car's previous owner - Christopher Morrison, of Bracknell, Berkshire - who told her he had lost his three-year-old snake two months ago.

The roofer and reptile collector said he was moving the snake in a cage to a friend’s house when it vanished.

She was cleaning out the used car when she found the snake in the boot, which she slammed shut and fled

Mr Morrison, 29, said: ‘I lost it a couple of months ago.

‘I did have it in a cage and was moving it to my mates. It got out.

‘I checked everywhere. I had ripped that car to pieces. I thought it must have got out.

‘I wouldn’t leave it.’

Mr Morrison’s heavily pregnant girlfriend, Sammi Larkins, who co-owned the car, added: ‘We wouldn’t have sold it if we thought it was in there.’

He accepted it would not be a pleasant experience to make such a discovery.
