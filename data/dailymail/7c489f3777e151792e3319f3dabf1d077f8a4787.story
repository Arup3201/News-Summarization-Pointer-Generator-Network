Paying toll charges is an unfortunate reality of life on the road that most drivers just learn to deal with.

But, as these pictures show, some motorists are so desperate to cling onto their loose change that almost anything is fair game for dodging the collectors- who often ask as little as 26 cents.

Everyday tactics for avoiding number plate-tracking cameras including bending the plate back or trying to change the numbers by smearing on grease.

Sneaky: A motorcyclist reaches back to obscure his numberplate - a dangerous move that will save him between 26 cents and a dollar and a half

Extreme: This passenger braved leaning out the back of his friend's car to avoid paying a toll

Bent back: Some drivers take the less eye-catching decision to bend their plates to an angle where they can't be read by cameras

But truly inventive - or desperate - road users have gone even further, leaning out the trunks of their cars, or even standing on top of them to obscure the plates.

Motorcylists put their balance to the test, either reaching back to put their hand over the registrations plates, or even lifting up their legs and obscuring the letters and digits with their feet.

New examples of the sneaky tricks were brought to light by an NBC6 investigation into the ongoing problem in southern Florida.

An accident? Duct tape and innocent-looking smears have also been employed as means of getting out of charges

Not recommended: In the most extreme example pictures, a man clings to the top of a car and obscures the plates with his legs

Dirty trick: Another driver obscured his registration with semi-opaque plastic - while artfully-placed grease turned two zeroes into figures of 8

According to Sunpass, the organization which operates tolling in the area, the company loses out on $36million every year because of drivers who skip the charges.

NBC6 reporters rode along with Florida's highway patrol as they tried to crack down on the problem - though apparent offenders were reluctant to explain themselves.

According to officers, truck drivers are the most frequent offenders, as they pass the toll plazas several times per day and can expect their bills to reach hundreds of dollars a month.

Getting caught out dodging a toll can mean a fine of at least $135, and repeated offences can lose motorists their license.

But the threat seems to do little to deter the hundreds of drivers, finding ever-more-inventive ways to beat the system. 

Careful: One motorcyclist leans as far forward as he can and wraps his legs around the vehicle to dodge the fare

Toe-tally shameless: This driver uses his foot to contribute to southern Florida's $36million toll-dodging problem

Cover-up: A simple sheet of paper or plastic makes this driver impossible to scope out at night
