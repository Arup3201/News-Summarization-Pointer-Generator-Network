Vladimir Putin has admitted that some of his media adventures with wildlife were carefully staged, but said they were worthwhile because they drew attention to conservation projects.

The Russian president's appearances with everything from tigers to whales have been a staple of Russian state TV for years, cementing his image as a man of action.

They have drawn mockery from critics, however, who have likened them to Soviet-style propaganda.

Carefully staged: Vladimir Putin has often by portrayed by the media as a rugged outdoorsman, but for the first time has admitted that the various stunts he takes part in are carefully stage-managed

Putin's spokesman has previously revealed that at least one of the stunts was a set-up, but Mr Putin has appeared to play along, allowing state media to present them as they seem rather than how they really are.

But in a meeting with a Kremlin critic after his latest stunt - taking to the skies in a light aircraft with a group of cranes last week - Mr Putin admitted he had often taken part in media exercises which were carefully stage-managed.

Sometimes, he said, the stunts had been over the top. 'Of course, there are excesses. And I am enraged about it,' he told Masha Gessen, a journalist and staunch Putin critic.

She had been invited for a meeting in the Kremlin after she was sacked from her job editing a travel magazine for refusing to send reporters to cover the crane flight.

She wrote an account of her meeting with the president in Bolshoi Gorod magazine.

Opposition: President Putin insisted the value 
of the stunts was to draw awareness to wildlife conservation, in an 
interview the with journalist Masha Gessen, a Putin critic who lost her 
job because of her political stance

'But I thought up these tigers myself. Twenty other countries where tigers live, also started taking care of them,' she quoted him as saying, referring to an incident four years ago when he was shown shooting a tiger with a tranquiliser gun in order to track it for a conservation project.

Critics later suggested the tiger had been driven in from a zoo for Mr Putin to shoot for the TV cameras.

'The leopards were also my idea,' Mr Putin was quoted as saying. 'Yes, I know, they were caught before but the most important thing is to draw public attention to the problem.'

He was apparently referring to an episode in 2011 when he was shown tagging and releasing a rare and injured snow leopard. Critics again said it had been brought in specially.

'Everything I do in this area (wildlife conservation) should have nothing to do with politics. But for a man in my position it is very difficult,' Mr Putin said.

Mr Putin also admitted that a stunt last year for which he donned a wet suit and dove to the bottom of the Black Sea to apparently discover ancient amphorae was also not what it seemed.

'Why did I dive? Not to show my gills off but to make sure people learn history. Of course it was a set up,' the journalist quoted Mr Putin as saying.

The Russian president's spokesman has previously revealed the Black Sea find was staged, admitting it was 'obvious' the jugs had been found earlier by archaeologists and left their for Mr Putin to find.

Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, where Mr Putin is spending a few days this week, that Ms Gessen had provided 'a correct account of the meeting except for some insignificant details.'

Mr Putin's summons to Ms Gessen appeared to be an attempt to mediate in her dispute with her former employer.

She said that Mr Putin, flanked by the magazine's owner, asked her whether she really wanted to have her job back or whether she was comfortable with the role of 'a persecuted journalist'.

Ms Gessen wrote that she had refused to accept Mr Putin's offer to take her old job back, saying she did not want to work in a magazine where an editor-in-chief is appointed by Mr Putin.

However, Mr Peskov said that Ms Gessen had initially agreed to take her old job back only to change her mind the following day.
