On April 15, two teenage girls calling themselves Double Take released a music video entitled Hot Problems.

Within the week, hundreds of thousands of internet users retaliated, many of them calling the video the stupidest thing on the web.

ABC News dubbed Hot Problems as ‘the worst song of 2012 – if not of all time’ and The Next Web described it as ‘the video that destroyed my faith in humanity.’

'We're hot!': Pop duo Double Take in their music video Hot Problems in which they lament the downsides to being pretty

Backlash: The video has garnered more than 100,000 'dislikes' on YouTube and a paltry 8,600 'likes' as of Saturday morning

Internet watcher Gawker jumped on the hyperbolic bandwagon, saying: ‘The worst song ever is pretty d*mn terrible.’

However, MSNBC tech blogger Helen A.S. Popkin has a very different view on the video, which was performed by Drew Garrett and Lauren Willy.

She questions why, in the age when bullying is being put in the spotlight, it is so in favour to lambast teenage girls for doing something fairly harmless.

While Ms Popkin doesn’t praise the girls’ musical talents (or lack thereof), she does say that the video is typical behaviour from teenage girls.

Ms Garret told MTV News that she and Ms Willy meant no harm, saying: ‘It was all just for fun and to just have something we could share with our friends.

'Downsides to being pretty': Double Take have split opinion as journalist Samantha Brick, pictured, did when she wrote how women hated her because of her 'lovely looks'

‘We enjoy writing funny lyrics and songs and we decided that we really liked this one.’

Ms Willy added: ‘We knew we couldn’t really sing.’

There are more than 54,000 comments and counting on YouTube – many of them complaining over the mediocrity of the song and of its performers. Read a short selection of comments below.

Last year, Rebecca Black received waves of backlash for her now-notorious video celebrating the last work day of the week, Friday.

The two wannabe pop princesses have also been propelled into a storm of Samantha Brick proportions.

In the video, Drew and Lauren gesture flirtatiously in the back of a limousine while recounting all the obstacles they encounter with men and other girls because of their looks.

Lamenting (out of tune) over a rather dodgy 
electro-pop backing track, they proclaim: 'Hot girls we have problems, 
too. We're just like you, except we're hot.'

Other lines include: 'Please don't get me wrong. I know I'm hot, but textbook perfection really takes a lot.

'Weird guys calls my phone and girls call names... but I can't be tamed.'

The song is at serious risk of splitting opinion as ferociously as Mrs Brick did when she claimed in a Daily Mail article earlier this month that women loathed her for being too attractive.

She said: 'There are downsides to being pretty — the main one being that other women hate me for no other reason than my lovely looks.'

Last year's meme: Double Take's video attracked derogatory comparisons to Rebecca Black's Friday which was heavily slammed last year

Her initial story attracted 1.6million hits - and thousands of vitriolic insults - on MailOnline, rising to 2.7million when including her follow-up article defending her stance.

In a similar brewing storm, the 'Hot Problems' video has been watched more than a million times on YouTube, but has received more than 100,000 'dislikes' compared to just 8,600 'likes'.

One poster pleaded: 'Please shoot my ears off.'

As if anticipating the resultant backlash, the production company, Old Bailey Productions, made sure to distance itself from the video.

'Old Bailey Productions did not create any of the audio or lyrics for this video,' it stated in the description. 'We produced the video as a favor.'

From an 'artistic' point of view, many are also making derogatory comparisons to Rebecca Black's widely slated flop Friday which was dubbed possibly the 'worst video of all time' last year.

It is not entirely clear whether the high school pair are merely being tongue in cheek, but they have said they created the video 'just for fun'.
