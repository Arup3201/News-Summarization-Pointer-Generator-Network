BBC presenters have been accused of being ‘insensitive’ when interviewing losing British competitors.

Sports editor David Bond sparked 162 complaints after the cycling road race when he questioned Mark Cavendish, which elicited an angry response from the rider.

Jill Douglas was criticised for her interview with Victoria Pendleton after a disqualification, and the attitude of other presenters have prompted a storm of anger from viewers.

There were also 152 complaints after a joke by Gary Lineker about how many medals Germany had won.

The BBC has been hit by claims that it has been 'insensitive' when interviewing losing competitors from the British team. Complainants have accused interviewers of being too brutal or negative with clearly disappointed contestants.

Last weekend David Bond asked Cavendish after the 250km race: 'Was Tour de France tiredness a factor? The cyclist reacted angrily and said: 'Stop asking stupid questions. Do you know about cycling?'

The BBC was deluged with complaints that Mr Bond's report was of 'poor quality' and biased against the British team.

And people took to Twitter to vent their frustration at the 'negative and insensitive' approach they feel many BBC presenters have adopted.

Referring to interviews where Team GB lost out on medals, Twitter users said BBC interviewers needed to approach the athletes with a little more sensitivity.

Another, using the name Marek Parkola, referred to one unnamed interviewer, complaining: 'The
 #bbc interviewer who has been chatting to her needs to be sacked 
though, so insensitive and clearly clueless. No place on tv.'

Swimming champion Sharron Davies has 
come under fire for 'commiserating' with Olympian Rebecca Adlington, 
asking her if she was disappointed with her bronze medal in the 800m 
race.

User Sam Gray ‏tweeted: 'Disappointment for winning bronze, are you bloody crazy? Sometimes the BBC reporters are as insensitive as they come. You swim 800m!!!'

The interview with triathlete Helen Jenkins, who came fifth, also provoked anger from the audience.

One Twitter user, under the name Steven Stokes said: 'BBC's Olympic coverage is superb but tone of Helen Jenkins interview was inappropriate. Made her sound like a failure. Amazing effort by her.'

Victoria Allen ‏agreed with the comment, saying: 'Insensitive BBC commentator just then covering the women's triathalon post race interviews'

Others have claimed the interviews with British judo competitors have been too downbeat, after GB judo contender Euan Barton was knocked out of the competition and nearly in tears while a reporter tried to interview him.

One seething Twitter user called James Phillips wrote: 'I can't believe the BBC were so insensitive. To interview Euan Barton then was cruel and unnecessary.

Cycling reporter Jill Douglas was criticised for being insensitive when she spoke to cyclist Victoria Pendleton after she and her partner Jess Varnish were disqualified from a race.

One viewer said: 'The BBC's coverage of the Games is almost superb, but some of the Interviewers are quite insensitive when interviewing sportsmen and women when they have just finished competing.'

Another said: 'No sportsman/woman needs to be told when they haven't achieved their best, they all know that. Please be more sensitive.'

One added: 'Strongly feel BBC journalists should not bully unsuccessful athletes until they crack & cry. It does NOT make good tv. It's insensitive.'

Responding to the David Bond criticisms, the BBC said: 'We believe the report was balanced as it reflected the enormous recent success of the British cycling team and, as such, the sense of disappointment at the lack of a medal.'

But at least one presenter has been praised for her upbeat attitude; Claire Balding has been widely applauded for her hilarious and heartwarming interview with the flabbergasted father of 100m butterfly winner Chad Le Clos.
