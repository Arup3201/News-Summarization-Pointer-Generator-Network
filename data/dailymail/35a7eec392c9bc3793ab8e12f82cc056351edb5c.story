A bingo player is lucky to be alive after the 80-year-old’s car was crushed by a heavy metal crash barrier at his local bingo hall.

Kenneth Compton, 80, managed to stumble from his Renault Scenic after the quarter tonne metal gate crashed down on the bonnet of his car at the Gala Bingo hall in Erdington, Birmingham just moments after he had dropped his wife off at bingo.

The 23-ft-wide barrier speared the car with such force that it bent the roof out of shape, completely shattered the windscreen and left Mr Compton with a head injury and fractured eye socket.

Bingo player's luck: Kenneth Compton is lucky to be alive after a heavy metal barrier crashed down on his car which bent the roof out of shape, completely shattered the windscreen and left Mr Compton with a head injury and fractured eye socket

At Birmingham Magistrates Court, parent company Gala Leisure Limited was fined £25,000 last Friday after it was found that Gala Bingo had not secured the barrier with a padlock at its Kingsbury Rd branch.

Investigators found that locks had been 
used previously but may have rusted and been removed in the lead-up to 
the near-fatal incident on June 3, 2011.

Mr Compton, of Great Barr, Birmingham, said he suffered dizzy spells since the incident.

He said: ‘It was absolutely terrifying but I'm OK now. I just want to move on now and forget all about it.'

His wife Ada, 82, added: ‘When I saw the picture of the car I was horrified. 

‘He is very lucky to be alive.

‘He still has had a few dizzy spells but we're just glad he's still here.’

The court heard that the company had 
failed to take the barriers into account in their risk assessments and 
were fined for two health and safety breaches.

Councillor Barbara Dring, chair of 
Birmingham City Council's licensing and public protection committee, 
said after the case: ‘The failure to assess the risk and secure the 
barrier put members of the public at risk. 

‘As a result of the company's irresponsible actions a person was hospitalised with serious head injuries.

‘Gala
Leisure Limited and other companies who use security barriers need to 
make sure that lessons are learned from this case, which could, as a 
worst case scenario, resulted in a death.’

The company was also ordered to pay 
£2,612 in costs after pleading guilty to offences under the Health and 
Safety at Work Act and the Management of Health and Safety at Work 
Regulations.

A spokesperson for Gala Bingo said today that the company 'fully accepted' the fine issued by the court.

She said: 'Gala Bingo fully accepts the fine that was awarded in the court.'

Birmingham City Council's head of environmental health Mark Croxford said: 'I think everybody was surprised that it wasn't much worse, even at five miles per hour being hit by that sort of barrier could be fatal.

'Mr Compton was lucky in that he only received a glancing blow, if it had hit him square-on it would be a different story, you can see what it did to the roof of the car in the pictures.

'Apparently people in the car behind his just saw his car deforming as the barrier went into it.

'I know that the crews who attended the scene were expecting the worst when they arrived.

'To be fair to Gala Bingo, they held their hands up and admitted they'd made a very big mistake from the off.

'They've taken the experience and learnt from it to make sure it never happens again.

'You couldn't imagine telling a wife why her husband hasn't come back to pick her up.'
