A man has been arrested after attempting to take the ultimate shell-fie by standing on top of a 120-year-old giant tortoise at an Indian zoo.

Fazal Shaik, 24, has been arrested for wildlife offences in Hyderabad, a city in eastern India, after uploading the picture on to social media sites.

He posed for the picture while standing on the Galapagos tortoise's shell after jumping into the giant reptile's enclosure while visiting the city zoo.

The garage worker was arrested after he uploaded the snaps onto his Facebook page and shared them on Twitter.

Fazal, who is facing six months in jail if convicted, told police: 'I just wanted to put it up on Facebook so I'd get lots of likes.'

Nehru Zoological Park curator Ramakrishna Rao said: 'I am glad the police are making an example of him and I hope it will deter others. 

'He did get a lot of attention, but I hope it is not the sort he wanted.

'It is a privilege to be able to see these magnificent creatures close up. This sort of cruelty and stupidity cannot be tolerated.'

Galapagos giant tortoises are the largest living species of tortoise on the planet and the 14th-heaviest living reptile. 

They are classed as a 'vulnerable' species which means they are likely to become endangered.

They have life spans of well over 100 years - with one which was bred in captivity living to around 170 years.

Tortoise numbers declined from over 250,000 in the 16th century to a low of around 3,000 in the 1970s.
