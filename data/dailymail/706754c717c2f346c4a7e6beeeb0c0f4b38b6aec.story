Two former U.S. soldiers  have have been sentenced to four years and nine months in prison for stealing millions of pounds  in government funds while they were stationed in Saudi Arabia.

Jasen Minter, 44, from Fayetteville, Georgia, and  Louis E. Nock, 48, from Orlando, Florida, were sentenced in Coweta County, Georgia for stealing the large sum of cash.

Theft: Jasen Minter, 44, from Fayetteville, Georgia, and Louis E. Nock, 48, from Orlando, Florida, were sentenced in Coweta County, Georgia for stealing the money 

Acting US Attorney John Horn said: 'Best we know from the evidence is they just shipped it back in boxes. It was all cash'

According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the duo stole $2.7 million in 2006 through withdrawals in June and August, and sent the money home, according to Georgia Newsday. 

Both have been ordered to pay more than $2.2 million in restitution. The theft was uncovered in a Department of Defense audit.

Acting US Attorney John Horn said: 'Best we know from the evidence is they just shipped it back in boxes. It was all cash.

'This was an egregious abuse of trust by two former U.S. Army soldiers who had access to millions of dollars of government money.

'Their conduct betrayed their trust and honor as service members and took substantial funds away from the United States Military Training Mission in Saudi Arabia.'

He added: 'We were able to recover $600,000 by forfeiting some of the property that they purchased with stolen money. We forfeited boats, vehicles and a house.'
