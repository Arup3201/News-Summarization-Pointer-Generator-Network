A staggering 32.2 per cent of Real Madrid fans would drop three-time Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, according to a poll in Spanish newspaper AS.

On a weekend that saw Real Madrid lose their grasp on top spot in La Liga for the first time time since November, fans of the Spanish giants have had their say on the team's current predicament.

Supporters were first posed a question regarding formation, and an incredible 92.1 per cent of fans called for Carlo Ancelotti to ditch his current tactics and revert to a 4-4-2 formation.

Cristiano Ronaldo would be dropped by 32.2 per cent of Real Madrid fans, according to a poll in AS

Gareth Bale is the least popular of Madrid's  front three and nearly half the fans asked would bench him

Karim Benzema claims he is the 'first one to arrive and the last to leave' the Real Madrid training ground

Real Madrid fans were asked which of their front three should be dropped. Here are the results:

1st: Gareth Bale - 46.1 per cent

2nd: Cristiano Ronaldo - 32.2 per cent

3rd: Karim Benzema - 21.7 per cent 

That would mean one of Madrid's impressive front three, the so-called 'BBC' of Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo, would need to make way.

In the poll, Bale, who has been jeered on a couple of occasions despite his impressive start in the Spanish capital, was top of the pile, while Ronaldo was second.

Benzema, therefore, has proven to be the most popular member of Madrid's frontline; a stat which will surprise many given Ronaldo's previous success at the club.

Bale picked up a worrying 46.1 per cent of the votes, while Ronaldo would be dropped by 32.2 per cent of supporters.

Los Blancos fell to a disappointing 1-0 loss at Athletic Bilbao on Saturday and are now second in La Liga

Ancelotti stands in front of the bench - but could one of Ronaldo, Bale or Benzema soon be sitting there?

Benzema should make way according to just 21.7 per cent of Madrid fans, and alongside the poll AS carry a quote from the French forward where he says: 'I'm the first one to arrive and the last to leave.'

Perhaps that is an endearing quality that has helped his popularity in the Spanish capital. 

Madrid fell to a disappointing 1-0 defeat at Athletic Bilbao on Saturday and before that could only manage a draw against Villarreal.

Suarez also got a brace as Barcelona went top of the league after beating Rayo Vallecano

An emphatic 6-1 win for Barcelona over Rayo Vallecano at the Nou Camp - the complete antithesis of Madrid's recent performances - has left Los Blancos a point behind their rivals at the top of La Liga.

AS also reveal that since Christmas, the average goals-per-game ratio for Real Madrid has dropped from 2.6 to 1.3 - exactly half the amount they scored in the first half of the season. 

These are certainly worrying times at the Bernabeu. Tuesday night sees them take to the field in a vital Champions League last-16 tie against Schalke holding a 2-0 lead from the first leg.

Following that, Madrid face Levante in the league, before a potentially title-defining clash at the Nou Camp. Sunday, March 22 - make or break for Ancelotti and his team.
