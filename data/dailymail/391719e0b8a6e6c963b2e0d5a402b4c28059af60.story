Sizzling: Downton Abbey star Lily James was involved in a blazing drama of a different kind during the filming of Disney's live-action Cinderella when a wedding gown she was wearing caught fire

Sizzling Downton Abbey star Lily James was involved in a blazing drama of a different kind during the filming of Disney’s live-action Cinderella extravaganza when a sumptuous wedding gown she was wearing caught fire.

The 24-year-old had been shooting a scene at Pinewood studios. The bridal dress — with its voluminous skirts, three miles of hemming and covered in Swarovski crystals — is a work of art in its own right. It covers so much square footage the actress can’t always see what’s in front of her.

She was led into her dressing room (a large tent in a corner of the vast 007 sound stage) and her hem brushed against a heater and began smouldering.

‘It had turned really cold and someone had put a three-bar heater a bit too close to where Lily was going to sit on a stool,’ explained distinguished costume designer Sandy Powell.

‘Luckily, just a segment of the silk dress got burnt. Thank God Lily wasn’t harmed,’ added Powell  who has collected three Oscars and two Baftas for her screen creations.

‘I wore this wedding dress for about 20 seconds before I walked past the heater and burned some of it,’ Lily told me as she was preparing to film sequences on another occasion with Richard Madden as her dashing Prince Charming.

She said she was in tears at first — until Ben Chaplin, who plays Cinderella’s father, lightened the mood by saying: ‘Well, I’ll wait a while before I make the Cinders joke.’ 

Lily said: ‘I went: “Oh, no!” And I was laughing through my tears.

‘I was fine. I wasn’t hurt, just a bit shocked for a little while.’

There are several copies of the wedding gown in varying weights for different circumstances, such as coming down a marble staircase, for dancing and walking. The one that was burned had a number of heavy skirts. ‘It’s sort of torture, wearing this dress,’ Lily explained because of having to wear a corset that cinches her down to a 21in waist.

‘I have no waist,’  she said laughing. ‘It’s really hard to eat. I have soup, and if I follow with two squares of chocolate, I’m stuffed. It’s so depressing,’ she added, collapsing into giggles.

‘And because everything’s so tight, I  burp. You just have to burp when you need to.’

But,
 incendiary dresses aside, Lily said she’s been having ‘a ball’ working 
with director Kenneth Branagh and a bevy of leading ladies, including 
Cate Blanchett as her wicked-ish step-mother, Helena Bonham Carter as 
her fairy godmother and Holliday Grainger and Sophie McShera as 
Cinderella’s step-sisters.

Her male co-stars include Stellan Skarsgard, Nonso Anozie and Derek Jacobi.

David
 Barron and Allison Shearmur, who are producing the film for the Disney 
corporation, said the picture won’t be released until Easter 2015.

Meanwhile,
 Lily is taking a well-earned festive break before rejoining her Downton
 Abbey ‘family’ in February to film the fifth series, in which she plays
 the vivacious Lady Rose.

Day job: Lily James as Lady Rose in Downton Abbey

Amy Adams believes she and Jennifer Lawrence have — how can one say this — more ‘male attributes’ than the men in the great new movie American Hustle.

The two stars play adversaries in David O. Russell’s fictionalised picture based loosely on a real-life Seventies scandal involving con men, the FBI, a fake sheik, a Mafia don and some really cool dirty dancing.

Amy, who starred in the recent Superman (and will soon shoot its Batman vs Superman sequel) and Doubt and Russell’s award-winning The Fighter, plays a trickster who hooks up with a fellow fraudster, played by Christian Bale (they bond over Duke Ellington), who happens to be married to a fiery Jennifer Lawrence.

When Amy and Jennifer’s characters meet, sparks fly, and they seal their loathing with a whopper of a kiss.

Amy lauds Russell for finding two plum parts for women. ‘He applies what could be considered male attributes to his female characters, and they sometimes have the biggest b***s in his films,’ she told me from Los Angeles.

Amy’s character, Sydney, has the smartest moves, too, when she meets Bradley Cooper’s dandy FBI agent. 

In her low-cut Seventies frock, she and Cooper, both professionally trained, perform a fabulous dance scene that very much evokes the era.

Amy said she’d love to go out dancing with Cooper off-screen, ‘but tongues would wag’.

Sydney wouldn’t ever worry about such things.

‘Sydney has great strength, but I think she’s lost morally,’ Amy attests.

On occasion, she took Sydney home. 

‘I certainly wore low-cut shirts all around the house,’ she teased.

American Hustle, which opens today, is one of the year’s most delicious movies. It has multiple Golden Globe nominations and is expected to do well when Bafta and Oscar lists are announced early in January.

Rachael Stirling will lead a rare production of Terence Rattigan¿s 1958 play Variation On A Theme

Rachael Stirling, who will lead a rare production of Terence Rattigan’s 1958 play Variation On A Theme, which hasn’t been seen in London for more than 50 years.

It’s about a high-society hostess, a ballet dancer and a choreographer who become embroiled in a spiteful love triangle.

The play arrived at the same time  as the theatre of the Angry Young  Man — led by John Osborne, Arnold Wesker and Harold Pinter — was hitting the Royal Court and elsewhere, and critics found Rattigan’s work rather tame by comparison.

But several recent Rattigan revivals have proved that his work remains powerfully potent.

Rachael (pictured below left) — the daughter of actress Diana Rigg — took part in a staged reading of Variation On A Theme during the Rattigan centenary at the Chichester Festival Theatre two years ago.

Now the HPZ production company  is bringing the play — with Rachael as the socialite Rose — to the Finborough Theatre in London’s Earls Court from February 25.

‘It didn’t receive a favourable reception initially,’ said Sam Zdzieblo, a member of the production team. ‘But it’s a bit of a lost treasure.’

The original production, starring Margaret Leighton and Jeremy Brett, was directed by Sir John Gielgud.

Scarlett Johansson stars with Joaquin Phoenix in Spike Jonze¿s new movie Her, which opens here on February 14

Scarlett Johansson stars with Joaquin Phoenix in Spike Jonze’s new movie Her, which opens here on February 14. It’s the perfect date film.

However, you won’t see Scarlett (pictured right).

You hear her, though, and her vocal performance is breathtaking.

Scarlett’s is the voice at the other end of a personal dating system that Phoenix’s character joins.

He becomes obsessed with her. Members of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts have voted Scarlett onto a long list for the forthcoming Baftas.

Amanda Berry, Bafta’s chief 
executive, told me that Scarlett is  eligible, despite not appearing in 
the movie: ‘Why not? She gives a performance.’

Nominations
 are announced on January 8. If Scarlett’s name prevails, perhaps her 
first stop, in the flesh, will be Bafta’s LA Tea party at the Four 
Seasons in Beverly Hills next month. I’d be happy to pour her a cuppa.
