She's the daytime TV treasure with a serious passion for high street fashion and a loyal following of stylish women of a certain age.

And now ITV presenter Lorraine Kelly is taking her fashionista status one step further in her role as brand ambassador for retailer JD Williams.

Lorraine, 54, has been pictured modelling the new AW14 range from the brand and revealed that she will also dabble in the world of design for SS15 when she launches her own fashion line for them.

Fabulous fashion: Lorraine Kelly has been unveiled as a style ambassador for JD Williams, a clothing brand for the over fifties (coat, £85)

JD Williams quizzed their customers on whose style they loved and Lorraine was the unanimous winner, with British men and women both saying they 'trusted' the presenter.

Speaking at the launch of the range at London's Shangri-La hotel in the Shard last night, Lorraine told MailOnline: 'I'm thrilled that JD Williams have asked me to be an ambassador and you know what, I'm 54 and I absolutely love fashion.

Embracing fashion: Lorraine, 54, says that older women are often neglected by the fashion industry, despite them representing a larger portion of the market, and hopes this range will help change that (dress, £50)

How to look good over 50: Lorraine says that she has made key adjustments to pieces to ensure that they accentuate a woman's best assets (blouse, £29)

Parisian chic: Lorraine says that this Burberry-esque trench is her favourite piece from the range because it makes her feel like a chic French lady (coat, £40)

'My mum is 74 and she loves fashion, my daughter is 20 and she loves it too. I've always said it's an area that we've neglected and shame on us.'

Lorraine has lent her expertise to the brand and has provided the designers with advice on how to make clothes more flattering for over 50s - she's added sleeves to shift dresses and cuts to accentuate a woman's best assets.

Research reveals that the over 50 female fashion market in the 
UK is currently worth £2.5 billion per season, and is the fastest 
growing fashion sector, so it is surprising that it is not better catered 
for.

Big plans: As well as editing a range for JD Williams, Lorraine has already started designing her SS15 range for the brand and couldn't be more excited

Confidence in fashion: Lorraine says that feeling comfortable in what you're wearing is the most important thing when it comes to getting dressed in the morning (left: blouse, £28, right: blouse, £29)

Lorraine mused: 'These women have the spending power and they want to look fantastic, it doesn't matter what size or age they are, we have neglected them. I know this from my own experience, from talking to my mum and my viewers. The people that watch the show, I hope, will want to wear the clothes.'

Lorraine said she had met many women her age who have struggled to 
find clothes that flatter a slightly older figure while remaining 
stylish.

'Fashion is all about feeling comfortable in your own skin and all of the clothes that I've chosen make me feel great,' she said.

Speaking about the range, Toni Jones, editor of 30ishStylist.com, said: 'Lorraine is a brilliant poster girl for enjoying fashion in your fifties, she’s not afraid to experiment with colour and trends but sticks to classic and flattering shapes, which comes across in her first edit for the brand.

'She has chosen wearable pieces with a bit of a fashion edge, e.g. dressing up a cosy poncho with leather leggings, proving that you don’t need to try too hard to be stylish. No doubt this will encourage women stuck in a style rut to experiment a bit, and I’m confident the range will fly.'

Lorraine has already made a start on the designs for her SS15 range, which she says she's 'so excited' about.

'We ignore women sometimes,' she said. 'I'm proud of being 54, it's fine. When I was little, when you said you were 54 it sounded like you were a wee granny with a coat with one button and a tartan trolly you drag around.

'But that's all changed; in this day and age, we're feisty, fashionable and intelligent women who want more from life. We want to look great, feel great and this is such an exciting opportunity for me.

'Mature women....ignore us at your peril. We are a force to be reckoned with.'

Lorraine for JD Williams is available in sizes ten to 32, with prices ranging from £20 for a jewelled jersey top to £150 for an embellished party dress.
