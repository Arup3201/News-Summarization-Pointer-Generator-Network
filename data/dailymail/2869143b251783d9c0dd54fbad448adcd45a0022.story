Missing: Owen Brennan has not been seen by his family since December 17

The daughter of a racehorse trainer who went missing two weeks ago has appealed for him to return home.

Owen Brennan, 77, who is said to suffer from memory loss, has been missing from his home in Derby since December 17.

In a statement issued by Derbyshire Police, Mr Brennan's daughter, Cindy Beadling-Brennan, said: ‘This is so out of character for him. He is such a family man.

‘We are trying to stay strong as best we can but we just want to know where he is and want him to come home.’

Ms Beadling-Brennan also said Christmas had been a very difficult time for all the family.

Derbyshire Police said: 'Officers are becoming increasingly concerned for his safety as he has memory loss, the weather has been poor and he is without his medication.'

They added that Mr Brennan is a keen dog walker and asked that people remain vigilant particularly if they are out walking over the New Year period and look out for anyone fitting his description.

Police are continuing to search in the Worksop and Welbeck areas of Nottinghamshire where Mr Brennan has friends.

Mr Brennan is described as white, 5ft 7in tall, of slim build, with brown short hair that is going grey.

He was last seen wearing brown denim 
trousers with a red cross on the back pocket, a brown cotton type jacket
with a wool lining and a fur collar.

The popular Mr Brennan’s training career 
spans over 40 years, with his best horses including Vulrory's Clown, 
Speaker Weatherill and Strath Royal, winner of the Charlie Hall Chase at
Wetherby in 1998.
