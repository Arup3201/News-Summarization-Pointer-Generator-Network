Bobbi Kristina could have been submerged for as long as 15 minutes before she was found face-down in a bathtub on Saturday, according to reports.

The 21-year-old daughter of Whitney Houston remains in a coma in Emory University Hospital after she was found unconscious by her partner Nick Gordon and friend Max Lomas in her Roswell, Georgia home.

'It seems like it might've been 10 or 15 minutes that she must have been alone,' Lomas' attorney Ashleigh Merhant told E! News. 'But we don't know at what point she actually ended up in the tub during that time.'

'The odds are against her': Bobbi Kristina's cousin Jerod Brown wrote on his Instagram page on Thursday that 'doctors don't see any hope for change' in her condition as he called for prayers

Lomas found Bobbi Kristina after he went looking for her when a cable man knocked at the door, E! reported. When she did not respond, he went in and found her, his attorney said.

She was rushed to hospital and her family has remained tight-lipped about her condition, but on Thursday, her cousin took to Instagram to provide friends a heartbreaking update. 

'Though it seems the odds are against her,' Jerod Brown wrote, 'though doctors don't see any hope for change, though we might want to play detective and find out how she got there, though it looks impossible for her to stand again STILL PRAY FOR BK.' 

On Thursday, DailyMail.com learned that Bobbi's life-support machine was switched off.

'The plug on Bobbi Kristina has been pulled,' a police source said.

It is possible for a patient to survive despite artificial assistance being withdrawn.

Bobby Brown did not respond directly to the claims but slammed reports saying that the family were preparing to say goodbye to his youngest daughter.

'This is false, just as is the vast majority of the other reporting that is currently taking place,' he said in a statement on Thursday.

'If we issued a statement every time the media published a false report regarding this matter, that's all we would be doing 24 hours a day.'  

The last official word on Bobbi's condition from the family came on Tuesday when they said in a statement that she was 'fighting for her life and is surrounded by immediate family'.  

On Thursday, he briefly told Access Hollywood that his daughter was 'good'. He appeared tired and his eyes were red as if he had been crying, the program reported.

'We're praying,' he added. 

Bobbi's 'devastated' grandmother, gospel singer Cissy Houston, mother of Whitney, was also seen arriving at the hospital, according to Radar Online, having flown in from her New Jersey home.

'Cissy was so traumatized losing Whitney and the pain is still raw from that,' a source told the website.

'Watching Krissy in the hospital and in the coma is almost more than she can handle. This is almost too much sadness for her to bear.'

Meanwhile, Houston's mentor Clive Davis says he's been in touch the family and is praying for Bobbi. Davis said he's offered his support and and 'they're so grateful.'

'Of course it's heartbreaking to see the family go through this pain once again,' Davis said at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, where Houston died in 2012 and where he will hold a pre-Grammy gala Saturday. 'They just ask that the public respect their privacy.'    

Houston died in a bathtub from an 'accidental' drug overdose almost exactly three years ago, in tragically similar circumstances.

Authorities found a dozen prescription drug bottles in her Beverly Hills Hotel suite and listed heart disease and cocaine use as contributors, but concluded that she accidentally drowned.

Bobbi Kristina was found in eerily similar circumstances on Saturday morning.

Questions still remain over what part drugs - if any - played in Saturday's incident; police reportedly found narcotics in the home during a second search last weekend. 

Police said she was found by her purported husband, Nick Gordon, and a friend, Max Lomas. Lomas' lawyer has since said he was the one who found Bobbi Kristina and started CPR.

Bobby Brown spoke out earlier this week to correct reports that his daughter had married Gordon.

Bobbi Kristina and Gordon were brought up like brother and sister after Houston took Gordon in when he was 12. But following her death, the duo announced they were in a relationship. 

Then last January the couple announced that they had got married, and Bobbi Kristina posted photos of their 'wedding rings' on social media.

But on Tuesday a lawyer representing Bobbi's father released the following statement: 'We are currently investigating the events that led to the hospitalization of Bobbi Kristina.'

'To correct earlier reports, Bobbi Kristina is not and has never been married to Nick Gordon,' added Christopher Brown of Brown & Rosen LLC.

Relations between Gordon and  other family members have been rocky and he remains subject to a protective order barring him from being within 200 feet of Bobbi Kristina's aunt, Patricia Houston.
