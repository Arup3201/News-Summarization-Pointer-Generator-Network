David Cameron faced claims of a ¿Chequers cover-up¿ last night after the Government failed to publish a full list of visitors to his grace-and-favour country residence

David Cameron came under fresh pressure today to name every supporter, friend and lobbyist who has been wined and dined at his grace-and-favour mansion.

Downing Street has refused to release a full list of guests at the Prime Minister's Chequers retreat.

It claims there is no commitment to transparency where the bill for meals, drinks and hospitality was picked up by the Tory party.

Mr Cameron's official spokesman said: 'There are distinctions that are drawn with government business and party political business. I don;t think there is anything new in that.'

But he refused to say how many people had secretly visited Chequers or how much the Conservative party paid for entertaining supporters at the taxpayer-funded property.

The spokesman added: 'The approach is the one that has been taken forward for a very considerable time going back to before 2010.'

He insisted that despite the refusal to release the full Chequers guest list, the government is 'more government information than ever before'.

Mr Cameron faced claims of a ‘Chequers cover-up’ last night after the Government failed to publish a full list of visitors to his grace-and-favour country residence.

Downing Street was accused of exploiting a loophole which means visitors to Chequers funded by the Conservative Party, or the Prime Minister personally, are kept secret.

The latest annual Chequers guest list was finally published more than a year late on Friday evening, with no warning. 

It reveals that Mr Cameron entertained the Emir of Qatar and the provost of Eton, his old school, but is largely dominated by an uncontroversial string of Conservative and Liberal Democrat ministers. 

The last Chequers guest list included News International’s Rebekah Brooks, now on trial over phone hacking and other alleged offences, and Tory donor and treasurer Stanley Fink.

In 2012, Mr Cameron was forced to admit seeing at least 15 Tory donors, who have handed the party £23million, in a series of secret lunches and dinners at Downing Street and Chequers.

Michael Spencer, then Tory party treasurer and one of those who enjoyed hospitality, said in late 2009 that he expected a Tory government to axe the 50p rate, which it did on taking office.

A list of guests to Chevening, Nick Clegg’s official residence, was also published on Friday evening. It contains politicians, journalists and TV personalities, including Joanna Lumley and Clare Balding.

Critics said it appeared the Conservative Party was seeking to avoid scrutiny of sensitive friends and supporters’ visits to Chequers, near Ellesborough in Buckinghamshire, by paying for their hospitality. No details of how much was paid, or how charges were calculated, were available.

Michael Dugher, the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, has written to Mr Cameron demanding full publication.

‘There are some glaring omissions from the list,’ he wrote.

‘Chequers is a public building and being able to access it is  a privilege. The fact that the Conservative Party may have nominally paid to host various people at Chequers cannot be used as a device to block transparency in relation to lobbyists and others gaining access.’ 

Mr Dugher said it appeared that there was an ‘attempt to buy out of transparency, which leaves the perception of a Chequers cover-up’. 

He added: ‘Regrettably – given you once said “sunlight is the best disinfectant” – your previous commitments to openness have not been met. 

‘It is now vital that a full and complete list of all visitors to Chequers and Downing Street, whether paid for by the Prime Minister or by the Conservative Party, is published.’

John Mann, the Labour MP for Bassetlaw, said releasing the list quietly on a Friday night ‘smacks of burying bad news’. He said: ‘You would only do this if you’ve got something that you would be embarrassed about.’ 

A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘This return includes guests who have received official hospitality at Chequers, excluding officials and special advisers. 

‘Consistent with the practice  of previous administrations, it does not include those receiving  hospitality paid for personally by the Prime Minister or by the Conservative Party.’ 

The Tories accused Labour of ‘hypocrisy’ because Ed Miliband promised to give regular updates on meetings with trade unionists and donors, yet this has not happened since March 2012.

A Conservative spokesman said the party had published a list of the Prime Minister’s meetings with donors – including at Chequers – quarterly since 2012.

A Tory source said: ‘We’ve published expenses over £500 online and details of ministerial meetings. This is Grade A hypocrisy.’
