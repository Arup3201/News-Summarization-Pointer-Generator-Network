A vet who cares for the pets of celebrities fears that her own two seriously ill dogs have been stolen, after they both went missing during a burglary at her Los Angeles home.

Dr Sue Downing has offered a $500 reward for the safe return of three-year-old terrier Spice and Penny, a 13-year-old Pomeranian, who she believes thieves may try to sell to new owners.

She said nothing appears to have been stolen during the burglary of her Culver City property and one her dogs was still at the home, although the residence was ransacked.

'I've scoured the house, the yard, the neighborhood,' Ms Downing told KTLA 5 News. 'They're very sweet, very friendly dogs. I am heartbroken and desperately want them back.' 

The vet explained that she is particularly concerned as both dogs are ongoing medical conditions, and she fears for the animals' health.

Ms Downing, who also serves as a Commissioner at the Los Angeles Zoo, said she is not positive whether the thieves actually took the dogs.

She believes it is possible that the intruders left the gate at the property open and the animals escaped.

'I hope somebody has them,' she added.

'Of course I feel really invaded, but really, I don't care about any of the property. 

'I just want the dogs back, they're my family. I'm worried sick about them.'

Ms Downing said that she hopes that the dogs are being looked after somewhere, and she has released photos of the two dogs in hope that someone will recognize them and get in contact with her or Los Angeles police. 

But the vet says is also facing the possibility that they may have been stolen and sold on to new owners.

Both dogs are microchipped, but were not wearing their collars at the time of the burglary.

Ms Downing says she is 'worried' sick about her two dogs, and has appealed for anyone with information to come forward and contact her or Los Angeles police
