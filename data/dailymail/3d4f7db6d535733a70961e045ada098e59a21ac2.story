They recently gave a candid interview to People magazine where they denied reports they had been 'damaged' by the family reality show and described themselves as 'better than ever.'

But Kate Gosselin's twins Mady and Cara were strangely tongue tied during a live interview on The Today Show on Thursday.

While being quizzed by host Savannah Guthrie on whether they had anything to say about 'how your family are doing', the 13-year-old girls awkwardly looked at each other and their mother and failed to say a single word.

Kate was left awkwardly sitting in between them, as the silence extended, causing an extremely cringe-worthy moment.

'It's your chance... spit it out,' Kate demanded, clearly hoping her daughters would back up the comments they made in People. 'This is their chance and this is the most wordless I've heard them all morning,' she said, by way of explanation.

The twins, whose father is Jon Gosselin, didn't take the bait which clearly annoyed their mother.

'I don't want to speak for them but Mady
 go ahead - sort of the things that you said in the magazine,' declared Kate. 'That years
 later - they're good, they're fine. Go for it.'

'No, you just said it,' Maddy said stubbornly.

I don't want to speak for them: Gosselin had to step in to give her twins thoughts on the situation

'I said it,' Kate said, smiling through gritted teeth. 'They get really frustrated that people assume certain things in our 
house and they always say, "But that’s not how it is, mommy. Why do they
 say that about us?"

Guthrie tried a different tack, asking the twins if people have the 'wrong impression' of their family.

'I
 wouldn't say the wrong impression but not like the full story,' said 
Mady, who shot to fame along with her twin and Kate's nine-year-old 
sextuplets Aaden, Collin, Joel, Leah, Alexis, and Hannah in TLC reality show Jon & Kate Plus 8, which first aired on Discovery in 2007.

'A lot of people think that filming our show has damaged us, but it’s only really helped.'

Speechless: Cara didn't speak once during the awkward live television interview

No spotlight for me: Mady seemed reluctant to address rumours about their family

Thursday's interview appears to be part of Kate's campaign to address what she sees as 'inaccurate reporting' about the family and recent comments made by her ex husband Jon.

'They're more aware of what is out there, the inaccuracies, things that are said by the general public, their father, whoever, because their friends talk about it at school,' she told Guthrie. 'So, I sort of am forced to kind of inform them. We talk about it a lot.'

She refuted Guthrie's suggestion that
 bringing the girls on national TV could 'put them on the spot' and 
'continue the injury to them.'

'There is no injury to begin with,' said Kate. 'I can't get them to 
do anything they don't want to do as with any parent. It's not like I 
force them to do it. This was like "Hey, The Today Show asked us if we wanted to do this, and how did we feel
 about it".

'And they agreed to it, as with my nine year olds. It's a 
family decision so I think it's really frustrating when there's so much 
out there that's not true.'

In an attempt to try to explain the
 twins' silence was nothing to do with any 'damage', Kate attempted to 
get them to weigh in to the debate.

'I'm getting to the point where I'm 
extremely frustrated and I don't spend time worrying about it because 
I'm busy raising my kids,' she said. 'And we know the truth and that's why they're 
here even though they're tongue tied this morning, to say hey we're okay
 and doing well. Would that be accurate girls to say?'

Cara and Mady muttered an unenthusiastic 'yes' to
 their mother's question but perked up when Guthrie quizzed them on 
whether they had enjoyed being a part of the reality TV show.

Back to reality? The twins lit up when asked if they would like to return to reality TV

'Go for it - yes or no,' urged Kate, 38. 

'Yes - It was really fun and I really do miss it,' said a smiling Mady. 'And you do, too, Cara. Cara does, she's just not gonna say it.'

'There's
 a lot of fun opportunities,' added Kate. 'If it happens it does and if 
it doesn't, it doesn't and it's a family made decision.'

Meanwhile more information has emerged on Kate's demeanour behind the camera with a source telling Radar that the former reality star demanded to know what happened after Cara failed to speak one word during the interview.

'[Cara] simply shrugged her shoulders,' the production insider said. 'This seemed to 
make Kate even angrier and she rolled her eyes to onlookers nearby.'

The source added: 'We all 
genuinely felt for the girls. Kate is a tough cookie to please, it’s 
obvious that she expects a lot from Mady and Cara.'

Speaking out: Kate tried hard to get her point across but seemed highly embarrassed by her daughters' silence

More candid: Kate, Cara and Mady gave an interview to People magazine earlier this month

The website reports that the girls seemed fine, if a little sleepy, when they arrived at the Today Show's studio in New York and 'chatted to producers' before filming their segment. 

'As soon as the girls got on the set, their mood immediately changed. It was obvious to anyone watching they simply froze on camera,' the source said.

Their father Jon was equally unhappy about the situation, and called up TMZ to tell them he had been watching the awkward interview with his girlfriend.

'I felt upset. I was laying there with Liz [Jannetta] and we were like, "Say something girls. Come on! Just say something. Anything." And they didn't say anything and we were like, "Ugh, this is horrible,"' he said.

'Then I felt really bad. I mean, I didn't care too much for Kate or whatever, but I felt really bad for Mady and Cara because I love them and they're just put in this situation. It was like deer in the headlights.'

The 36-year-old added: 'It just kind of proves my point of Kate bringing the kids out instead of her just sort of doing it herself. It all blew up in everyone's face and I feel horrible for my children because now they're going to have to deal with the public.

'By body language they were probably like, "What's the moral thing to do and what does my mom want me to do?" They were torn and they just shutdown. It was just a classic case of being silent. You get to a point where you are like, "I don't know who to please. Do I please myself or do I please my parents - or my mother?"'

When asked if he felt like Kate manipulated them, Jon said: 'In my heart that's what I believe, that's how I feel. Can I prove it? I can't prove it, but you can't take my feelings away from me. I feel that way.'

He added: 'I just texted Mady and Cara today and said, "You guys looked great and I love you and have a good day in New York." I didn't really talk about it. I'm just here to offer them support and be their father.'

Damage control: Kate tweeted that her girls were quiet due to their appearance being their first live TV interview

Kate later tried to make light of the 
awkward interview, tweeting: 'Thanks to @TODAYshow for having Cara, Mady
 and me on the show today! 1st live interview can render even the 
gabbiest girls speechless :)'

Her comments came after her ex-husband Jon told InTouch earlier this month. '[Kate] uses [his kids] like props... it's so unfair to 
them. It's a problem for her that she can't afford our old lifestyle 
anymore.'

The former reality
 star who now works as a maître d' in Pennsylvania also said, 'I think 
she wants a show with the kids again. I consider that exploitation.'

People magazine noted that Jon will be 
appearing on the reality show VH1's Couples Therapy with new girlfriend 
Liz Janetta, a divorced mother of three, later this month.
