Speak up! Viewers said they missed out on some of the plot because they couldn't hear the speech in drama Parade's End starring Benedict Cumberbatch

Mumbling actors have been told to speak clearly after viewers complained the dialogue in many TV shows was inaudible, BBC chief Tony Hall admitted yesterday.

Several recent BBC dramas have been criticised for poor diction and muttered lines, while other programmes had to be re-edited to make background music quieter.

Responding to the criticism in the Radio Times, Lord Hall, 62, said: ‘I don’t want to sound like a grumpy old man, but I think muttering is something we could have a look at. 

‘Actors muttering can be testing... you find you have missed a line.

‘You are balancing people’s needs as they get older – which, as someone of my age, I completely appreciate – with the creative need of a director to put in music or sounds that help to make the drama or the programme more real and vital.’

His comments came after Radio Times reader Richard Andrews asked him: ‘Are all your sound engineers 25?

'Haven’t you got any 55-year-old ones who realise that it can be difficult to hear programmes because of background music?’

But Lord Hall said things had improved after director of TV Danny Cohen responded to complaints.

He added: ‘Danny Cohen has been going
 through this with executive producers to try to get this better, and I 
think the complaints are much, much reduced.’

Last year, actor Eddie Redmayne was criticised for mumbling in the BBC1 drama Birdsong.

Back to the drawing board: Producers had to re-edit the sound and background music on the flagship series The Wonders of the Universe. Viewers had complained that the music was distracting

Viewers also complained they were unable to make out key scenes in the historical drama Parade’s End, which starred Benedict Cumberbatch.

In 2011, producers had to re-edit the flagship series The Wonders Of The Universe after a flood of complaints about distracting music. 

The BBC2 art series Renaissance Revolution was also forced to re-edit its soundtrack in 2011 after its executive producer admitted he got ‘carried away’ because he loved the music so much.
