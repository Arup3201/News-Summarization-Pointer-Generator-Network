The mother of toddler Ayla Reynolds who went missing nearly two years ago has revealed that her daughter's blood was found in her ex's basement, his bedroom, his truck and on the base of his shoes.

Trista Reynolds is trying to reignite the investigation into her daughter's disappearance, which occurred in December 2011 when the then-20-month-old girl was spending the night at her father's home.

The news about the bloodstains come just two days after Ms Reynold's ex, Justin DiPietro, was put in jail for violating the conditions of his bail for a different charge.

Desperate: Trista Reynolds is coming forward with evidence against her ex that she hopes will reignite the search for her daughter Ayla who went missing in December 2011

Mom: Ayla, right, was in her father's custody while her mother, Trista Reynolds, left, checked into a 10-day rehab programme

DiPietro was charged with the domestic violence assault of his ex-girlfriend Courtney Roberts in July and one of his bail conditions was that he not use or possess alcohol.

On Monday, he was stopped by traffic police due to his car's expired inspection sticker. The officer discovered alcohol in the car and he was brought in.

Ms Reynolds is now making public some of the pieces of evidence about the case that the police have not yet released.

'Theres been nothing in two years and I think it might help just close it,' she said to local station WCSH of her decision to make the evidence public.

Father: Justin DiPietro, left, told cops he last saw Ayla, right, when
he put her to bed. He said she was wearing green 
pyjamas with polka dots and the words ‘Daddy's Princess’ on them

Father and daughter: Ayla's blood was found in the partially finished basement that DiPietro used as his bedroom

'If Ayla was their daughter or their child or their family member, I honestly believe that the case would be solved.'

She says that police showed her pictures of her daughter's blood that was found in DiPietro's basement, room, and truck.

A sample of the blood showed that the toddler's saliva was mixed with it, leading Ms Reynolds to believe that she suffered.

Mystery: Ayla Reynolds, of Waterville, Maine, 
was reported missing in December 2011 by her father 
Justin DiPietro, who told police he last saw her when he put her to bed 
the previous night

Police have not arrested DiPietro 
because there is no evidence to prove that he was the one who killed his
daughter, but they have said that they do not think it is reasonable to
believe that she is still alive.

'With
what was shown to me I don't see how any little child can survive after
that. All I can picture when I close my eyes is the blood that I saw,' 
Ms Reynolds said.

'No mom should have to ever experience what I did that day, ever.
