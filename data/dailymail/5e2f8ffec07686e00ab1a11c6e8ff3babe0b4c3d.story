It certainly shows the spoils of a busy day’s shooting.

Pippa Middleton, a well-known fan of the sporting life, poses with a group of women – and 50 birds laid at their feet.

The Duchess of Cambridge’s sister and her friends were pictured grinning broadly after what looks like a successful day’s sport at the sprawling Drum Estate in Gilmerton, south of Edinburgh.

The front row consists of partridges, the middle row has hen pheasants, while the back line comprises cock pheasants.

The photograph was posted on the picture-sharing website Instagram yesterday by a user called John Greig, whose page is publicly available for anyone to view.

He apparently posted the image just hours after the shoot.

Socialite Pippa, 30, was separately photographed on Friday at Edinburgh airport with her boyfriend, stockbroker Nico Jackson, 35.

It is believed the shoot may have been organised by Charlotte More Nisbett, the husband of Billy More Nisbett, whose family own the estate.

Earlier this year, Pippa grabbed the headlines after she went on a boar and deer hunting trip in France.
