A soap opera style dramatic divorce battle predated the recent trial of a Connecticut woman accused of hiring a hitman to kill her ex-husband in order to help her get his $50 million fortune, court documents reveal.

A mistrial was recently called in the case of Tiffany Stevens, 39. Prosecutors apparently could not fully convince a jury she'd attempted to pay career felon John McDaid $5,000 to kill her millionaire ex Eric Stevens in 2012.

But in making their case, the state helped reveal their turbulent marriage and mudslinging divorce that saw accusations of drug and gambling addictions lobbed, years of harassment endured by Mrs. Stevens and even an attempt by Mr. Stevens to get an insurance payout by blowing up his own car.

Back and forth: A mistrial was called last week in Stevens' trial after the jury was called themselves hung. Her ex has claimed she's an unpredictable drug addict while she says he's a problem gambler who's often threatened her to the point of her getting restraining orders

The way they were: A tumultuous marriage and divorce fit for a soap opera preceded Tiffany Stevens news-hogging trial on charges she paid a handy man to murder her ex husband Eric Stevens

The Hartford Courant reports that over 200 motions have been filed or judgments made in their cantankerous relationship.

They were married for just five years when divorce papers were filed in 2008 and Eric Stevens wrote: 'Wife has a new boyfriend living with her and our 4-year-old in our house. There is no chance for reconciliation.'

He filed an affidavit claiming his estranged wife was a drug addict with a drug addict boyfriend. He said she would often disappear for period of time when no one knew where she was.

Tiffany Stevens, in turn, hit back saying her husband was a serious gambling addict who'd racked up debt with the mafia and had even bombed his own car in order to get insurance money in order to pay back his debtors.

Tiffany Stevens went on to claim that soon after the car insurance fraud her husband would report a break in at their home he used to make an insurance claim on her jewelry he said had been taken.

Court documents also reveal that in June 2009, while the ongoing custody battle was just beginning, Tiffany Stevens was granted a restraining order against her ex. The order was extended multiple times.

Mr. Stevens was also caught trying to bribe a pawn shop employee to illegally sell him a gun just after the order was granted. And he would serve jail time for violating the order after going against it to visit his daughter at her West Hartford school.

The he said, she said frothiness of the proceedings no doubt contributed to the hung jury. 

A judge declared the mistrial Friday in the case of former Bloomfield resident Tiffany Stevens, who remains free on $1 million bail. 

The case is expected to be retried before another jury.

Stevens pleaded not guilty to attempted murder on allegations she paid $5,000 to a maintenance man in Simsbury to kill Eric Stevens in 2012.

Prosecutors say Tiffany Stevens was secretly recorded on audio talking about the alleged plot, but her lawyer said the recording was inconclusive and accused Eric Stevens of making up the story.

New trial: The handyman, and convicted felon, John McDaid told a Connecticut court earlier this month that Tiffany Stevens, 39, offered him $5,000 to kill her ex Eric Stevens in 2012.
