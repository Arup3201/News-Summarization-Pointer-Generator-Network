In an effort to help a group of pups, one British photographer has turned away from the sad animal cruelty commercials featuring Sarah McLachlan and turned toward something a bit more positive.

Stuart Holroyd, 34, takes elaborate portraits of abused, abandoned shelter dogs in an effort to raise money for their temporary home and ultimately land them a permanent one.

Holroyd, a seasoned photographer, places the dogs in stunning settings from one pup in a Christmas setting standing in front of a fireplace to a shaggy dog looking upward as a fluorescent butterfly hovers above his nose.

The effort is called The Bay Tree Project. 

Holroyd, from the U.K. now living in Cyprus, is publishing the 10 images in a book and displaying them in an exhibition in February with all proceeds going to the Bay Tree Boarding Kennels, an animal rescue shelter in Larnaca run by his friend Kayte Wilson-Smith, according to the project's Facebook page.

Wilson-Smith houses between 60 and 70 dogs at one time on her own pension and small donations, according to The Chive. 

Winston: A black pooch named Winston stands in a field with a man appearing to be riding on his back (Winston has been adopted) 

Fergus: A three-legged dog named Fergus stands majestically in the middle of a street with his tongue out 

With electricity and food donated to her by the locals, Wilson-Smith keeps the dogs in the small rescue center and helps them get adopted to other countries -- as animal cruelty in the Cyprus is rising, according to Chive.

'I saw my friend Kayte struggling and I wanted to do something different for her and try to get the problem noticed but in a more positive way,' Holroyd told Media Drum World.

'The shelter needs refurbishment so these animals can really have halfway house before their forever home.' 

Molly: Here, a dog named Molly stands near the edge of a cliff as a fluorescent butterfly hovers above her nose (Molly has been adopted)  

Ozzy: A dog names Ozzy sits in the grass in front of planes, wearing a military-style hat (Ozzy has been adopted)

So far, the puppy pics have raised the shelter 3,207 euros (that's 3,707 USD), according to the Bay Tree Project. The page indicates that the monetary goal is 5,000 euros. 

'This was only supposed to be a very small project but it has turned out to be bigger than we could imagine,' Holroyd told Bored Panda.

The project's Facebook page indicates that six of the 10 photographed dogs have been adopted as of Thursday.

Barney: A pup named Barney sits in the middle of a dirt road wearing a hat (Barney has been adopted) 

Milly: Here, a pup named Milly sits on a shore with lighthouse in the background 

Wolfie: Wolfie the pooch stands in the middle of a pier with the sun shining in the distance
