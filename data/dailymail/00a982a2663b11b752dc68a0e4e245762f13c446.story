The father of British-born ‘cop killer’ Alexandria Hollinghurst had a violent showdown with her boyfriend just hours before the couple took off on a rampage that ended with a police officer gunned down and the teens dead in an apparent suicide pact.

In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, 17-year-old Alex’s grandfather, David Hollinghurst, has revealed his son Tom’s desperate last-ditch bid to put an end to 18-year-old Brandon Goode’s relationship with his daughter.

He has told how the family had watched in despair as his ‘beautiful granddaughter’ went off the rails – stealing, ‘vanishing off’ and getting into drugs.

Final encounter: Mr Hollinghurst revealed to MailOnline that his son had a violent confrontation with Brandon Goode, 18 (right), before the teen and Alex Hollinghurst (left) ran off and gunned down a police officer  

And he has exposed a fantastical plot hatched by the teens to steal a boat, sail it to Panama and live on a beach.

Speaking from his home in Okeechobee, Florida, Mr Hollinghurst, 61, said: ‘Alex had vanished off in the night late on Wednesday and on Thursday Tom went round to Goode’s mother’s house and found Brandon there.

Victim: Windermere, Fla., Police Department Officer Robert German was shot and killed early March 22, 2014,  after stopping Alex and Brandon and calling for help in an Orlando suburb

‘He told me he yelled at him so all the neighbors could hear. He said he was going to have him charged with statutory rape if he came near his daughter again.

‘Goode wanted Tom to punch him so that he could report him for assault but Tom didn’t.’

MailOnline first told how Hollinghurst had been reported missing by her mother, Debra, on Thursday, March 20, only to return when the police officer responding to the call was out interviewing her in the family home.

But Mr Hollinghurst claimed: ‘She came back but only so she could take what she could before running off with him again.’

According to Mr Hollinghurst, his granddaughter stole a computer, jewelry and ‘anything else she could sell,’ before disappearing one final time some time during the night.

He tearfully recalled: ‘She’d been acting stupid like that for a while, vanishing off and coming back.’

Mr
 Hollinghurst, a former truck driver from Manchester who moved to the 
States in 1995, explained that he initially assumed this time would be 
no different.

But he said: ‘Tom phoned me on Saturday night at 7pm. He said, “They found her dad.”‘I said, “Where is she?”

‘He just said, “She f***ing dead.” I just shouted, “No!”’

The teenage lovers' bodies were found in the Orlando suburb of Windemere 100 yards from where officer Robert German was shot in the head.

They apparently killed the 31-year-old cop after he stopped them during a routine foot patrol through the neighborhood Saturday morning.

Mr Hollinghurst described the days since that awful moment as ‘one terrible time warp. It’s like one long day. It never ends.’

Asked whether he believed his granddaughter had taken her own life or was killed by her boyfriend, Mr Hollinghurst admitted he no longer knew what Alex was capable of.

He said: ‘They found out that the pair of them had planned to go down to Clearwater and steal a boat then sail it to Panama and live on a beach somewhere.

‘I don’t know what she was capable of. I don’t know what he was capable of.’

Living in fear: Mr Hollinghurst expected his granddaughter's boyfriend to show up at his house and kill him

When he heard his granddaughter was missing, he admitted, he half expected her to turn up at his home and feared her boyfriend would kill him.

He knew that her parents had struggled to control her in recent months.

He said: ‘She was such a beautiful little girl, the cutest thing and she knew it. She was always pretty and she could get whatever she wanted from her dad.

‘But she’d started stealing. She’d started with the drugs. She was so bright, so beautiful. She could have been anything.’

Apple of dad's eye: Alex's father, Tom Hollinghurst, was devoted to his daughter and nicknamed her 'Stick' because of her thin build

Mr Hollinghurst said that while Alex’s relationship with her mother was strained, Tom, 42, was ‘devoted’ to the daughter he nicknamed ‘Stick’ because of her slender frame and she to him.

He said: ‘Tom loved his girls – Debra and Hannah and Alex. He adopted Georgia the oldest, Debra had her already.

‘He called them his ‘girly gang.’ They could get him to do anything.’

He said that Alex was ‘good as gold’ until last fall when she began getting into trouble.

He said: ‘She disappeared off with her boyfriend just before Christmas and had only showed up at home again recently.

‘She wrecked her car in January – she just wasn’t looking left or right, just careless. She was stealing from the shoe shop where she worked.’

Shaking his head, he reflected how different the troubled teen of recent months was from the 11-year-old who came to America with her parents in 2007.

The family initially lived with Mr Hollinghurst and his late wife, Lynett, who died from breast cancer two years ago.

He recalled how Alex had settled into the local school before the family moved to Davenport a two-hour drive away.

The last time Alex visited her grandfather was, he said, just before Christmas 2011.

Her grandmother, who died at age 57, was desperately ill and she, sister Hannah and father Tom helped put up the tree and care for her.

Mr Hollinghurst said: ‘Alex was so good with Lynett. She couldn’t really talk, the cancer had gone to her brain and Alex devised a sort of chart so she could point to things, tell us what she wanted and it worked for a while.’

Now, he and the rest of his family are left struggling to understand how it all went so wrong, so quickly.

The Medical Examiner has yet to conclude his report and the cause of death is still pending.

Alex’s parents maintain she was killed by Goode and had not intended to take her own life. Whatever the truth, Mr Hollinghurst said he plans to leave America in the wake of the tragedy.

He said: ‘I arrived here in 1995 with $300 and a job in Alabama but I don’t want to be here now. The whole American dream’s over for me now.’
