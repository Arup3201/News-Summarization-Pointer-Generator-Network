In just six months, a camera technician lost nine and a half stone and has since gone on to become a fully qualified personal trainer.

Matt Deeming, 24, from Stoke on Trent, had struggled with his weight for years, but was in denial about how large he had become.

He said; 'I had a really poor diet and did barely any exercise.

Matt's New Year's resolution to lose weight has not only transformed his body, but put him on a new career path

'I was out drinking with my friends a lot, eating kebabs and living a completely unhealthy lifestyle. 

'However, after a Christmas shopping trip where I realised I had suddenly become a XXXL in shirts I decided that enough was enough and I needed to make a change.'

What started out as a simple New Year's resolution to join a gym and lose weight quickly turned into a single minded obsession.

Within six months Matt had gone from 23st to a much healthier 13st 7lb, dropping an astonishing 9st 7lb and totally transforming his body through a strict diet and exercise regime.

Matt commented; 'I completely changed my diet, found a regular training regime and with the help of my best friend and training partner, Jessica Bennett, I battled through each session.'

Although he was happy with the results of his weight loss, the rapid transformation had left Matt looking gaunt and unhealthy.

Matt's journey has seen him drop from 23st (left) to 13st 7lb before adding 2st of muscle to his frame (right) 

As a result, Matt decided he would attempt to gradually build up his weight in the form of muscle by undertaking weight training.

He said; 'I assessed my diet and training regime again and gradually built up my weight to just over 15st 7lb over the following 18 months.

'I changed to PhD Pharma Whey protein rather than the Diet version, cut down on carbohydrates and started to eat six meals a day which mainly involved protein, vegetables and nuts.' 

With diet and exercise becoming such a central part of Matt's life, he decided to take the next step and pursue a career in fitness and health. 

Matt said; 'I wanted to continue improving my own fitness but I also wanted to inspire others to do the same. 

'I could never picture myself the way I used to be and wanted to help others believe that it was possible too. I decided to take on the level 2 gym instructor and then the level 3 personal training courses. 

'Becoming active and losing weight has completely changed my life. I never thought I would be in the position to help others to achieve what I have'.

Matt currently balances his day job of being a camera technician with taking clients as a personal trainer after work and at the weekends.

He is hoping to become a full time personal trainer once he has built up a large enough client base and one day in the near future hopes to open his own gym.
