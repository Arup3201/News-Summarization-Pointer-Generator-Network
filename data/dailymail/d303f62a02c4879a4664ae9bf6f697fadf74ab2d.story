A woman who contacted an old friend through Facebook was lured to an isolated shed where she was bound and gagged, told she was going to be a 'sex slave' and raped.

William Jameson, who unknown to the victim had a history of violence including manslaughter, attempted murder and child rape, then left her tied up with a rope around her neck.

But the 31-year-old civil servant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, managed to free her feet and force her way out of the building with her wrists still tied by electric cable.

Jailed for life: William Jameson lured a 'friend' to an isolated shed where she was bound and gagged with electric cable and then raped

She frantically tried to raise the alarm and was seen by the driver of a passenger train as she ran alongside a railway track in Wiltshire waving her bound hands, an image which was caught by the onboard CCTV.

She then managed to reach a nearby farmhouse where, distressed and covered in mud and blood, she got help.

The victim, who worked in the civil service in Ireland, first met 48-year-old Jameson, who she knew as Liam, in 2004 when they were on a computer course.

She had suffered from delusions that a relative was being held against their will in hospital, which married Jameson knew about and preyed upon.

He enticed her to England saying he would help free the family member.

But he cheated her out of Â£18,000, saying he needed the money to pay for the relative's 'escape' and to buy some land in Wiltshire which they would sell at a profit.

In November last year he took her to a patch of land near the village of Minety, Wiltshire, under the pretence of meeting a nurse with the relative there.

But when he got her into the shed, Jameson forced her to the ground and tied her hands and feet with electric cable, binding it behind her back.

He put a gag in her mouth and tied a 
rope around her neck and started to strangle her, saying she was going 
to be his 'sex slave'.

Jameson told her he was 'a dangerous and violent man' and that he had been in prison in Belfast for rape and attempted murder.

Kerry Barker, prosecuting, told Swindon 
Crown Court she offered him more money in a bid to get him to leave her,
 but he was not interested and raped her.

After he went outside to answer his 
phone she heard him leave and the woman managed to free her feet after 
removing a shoe and sock.

She
 then forced the shed door and, with her hands still tied, got to the 
railway line before running to a nearby farm to raise the alarm.

After
 Jameson was arrested police searched his home and found he had more 
than 1,500 sickening films and pictures of violent sexual child abuse on
 his computer.

Jameson,
 of Finchampstead, Berkshire, pleaded guilty to rape, false imprisonment
 and ten counts of making indecent images of children.

Mr
 Barker told the court that in 1986 he was jailed for 12 years for 
attempted murder, attempted rape, and other sex offences against a 
child.

He lured an 
eight-year-old girl from a Belfast street before putting a belt round 
her neck and sexually abusing her, then twice slammed a breeze block 
into her head in an attempt to kill her.

In 1998 he was jailed for six years in Dublin after a man died when Jameson strangled him in a sex game.

Alex Daymond, defending, said his client realised he presented a danger to the public and was facing a lengthy jail term, but urged it to not be a life term.

He said Jameson had been abused terribly as a child and while in custody on remand was clean of drugs and was even a 'listener' for other prisoners.

Although the shed was kitted out with sex toys he said it was where his client went to act out his alter ego, Julie-Ann, away from his wife and was not set up for the rape.

Jailing him for life Recorder Peter Blair QC said: 'You pose a considerable risk of serious harm to the public. This case falls fair and square into one that that demands a sentence of life imprisonment.

'Mr Daymond rightly observes that this sentence should be reserved for the most grave cases - in my judgment this is one of those.

'I am quite simply of the view that there is a significant risk of serious harm to the pubic. Your offences are considerably serious to justify such a sentence. I also take into account your previous convictions.'

Jameson will not be allowed to seek parole for five years and must register as a sex offender for life.
