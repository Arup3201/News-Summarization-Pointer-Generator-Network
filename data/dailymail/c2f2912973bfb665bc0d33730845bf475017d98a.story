Customers can send an image of themselves through the company's website and the machine creates a thick layered chocolate portrait

Chocoholics who have not over-indulged this Christmas can have their portrait created out of their favourite food using the world's first 3D chocolate printer.

A company called Choc Edge has designed a  machine that allows users to build any 3D shape out of chocolate - including their own face.

Customers can send an image of themselves through the company's website and the machine creates a thick layered chocolate portrait for between £50 and £80.

The machine, called Choc Creator, works by squirting out chocolate according to computer instructions and allows a user to build any shape they like out of the sweet liquid.

The Choc Creator can print layers of dark, milk or white chocolate onto any flat surface including cakes and biscuits to create different shapes, designs and logos.

The company was set up in 2011 by Dr Liang Hao of the University of Exeter in Devon and has since sold the machines to companies across the globe.

The machine can also be used to produce a 2D portrait on edible rice paper for £24.99.

Dr Hao, a senior lecturer at Exeter 
University, said: ‘We have plans to supply to retail units on the high 
street so that everyone can print their own chocolate designs in their 
local chocolate shop.

‘What makes this technology special is that users will be able to design and make their own products.

‘Everyone loves chocolate so that's why we've tried to make it easy and accessible for mainstream consumers.’

Christina Zheng, business development director of Choc Edge, said: ‘The possibilities are endless - users can build any shape any size with the machine as it gives an unprecedented level of personalisation and flexibility.

‘The chocolate faces have proven really popular with the customers as they work really well as presents for people.’

She said there are plans to print chocolate in a rage of different colours which will enable users to create more elaborate designs.

‘Our vision is to free people's imagination by providing them with a new way to design and create unique chocolates.’

The Choc Creator is a desktop machine that allows individuals and businesses to create unique chocolate designs in either 2D or 3D.

It plugs into a computer using a USB port so that people can design sweets on www.chocedge.com or download designs created by the company.

that allows individuals and businesses to create unique chocolate 
designs in either 2D or 3D. It uses a special printing head to pipe lines of chocolate determined by a computerised design - such as Stephen fry's portrait (left). The machine's creator, Dr Hao is shown right

Using its special printing head, the machine can produce lines of chocolate as small as half a millimetre wide, with more precision than an expert using an old fashioned piping bag.

3D printing technology is already used in industry to produce plastic and metal products, but the company claims this is the first time it has been applied to chocolate.

Stephen Fry showed off the machine on his TV programme, The Gadget Man, when he held a dinner party for friends and used the equipment to create personalised chocolate portraits for his guests.
