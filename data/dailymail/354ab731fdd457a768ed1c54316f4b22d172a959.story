Carey Mulligan has spoken candidly about her grandmother's battle with Alzheimer's

She is the Oscar-nominated British actress who is taking the film industry by storm following her starring role in The Great Gatsby.

But Carey Mulligan yesterday proved she has more pressing things on her mind than the glitz and glamour of Hollywood as she spoke candidly about her grandmother’s battle with Alzheimer’s.

The 27-year-old described how upsetting it was watching her grandmother’s condition deteriorate over the past ten years until she could no longer recognise her.

‘She hasn’t recognised me for about five or six years,’ she said. ‘That’s really hard. It’s really sad. But especially for my mum and my aunt and uncle.’

The actress approached the Alzheimer’s Society, the leading UK care and research charity for people with this disease, offering to use her growing  status as a household name to draw attention to issues surrounding Alzheimer’s.

Now an ambassador for the charity, the actress said they had used music to help keep her grandmother – an accomplished piano player – happy.

‘We make mixed tapes and CDs and we’ve discovered that she really likes folk music, which we never discovered before,’ Mrs Mulligan said.

The actress, who is married to Marcus Mumford, lead singer of the band Mumford & Sons, described the process of her grandmother’s deterioration at an Alzheimer’s Society lunch yesterday.

She told Channel 4 News her grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s about ten years ago.

Miss Mulligan, who starred in Never Let Me Go, Drive, and Shame, before she played Daisy Buchanan in The Great Gatsby, continued: ‘She was a geography teacher and she was very passionate about our education and would always ask us about what GCSEs we were doing, what A-levels we were doing.

‘And I remember her one day not being able to remember the different subjects I was taking for A-level and I remember thinking that was something she cared so much about, that wouldn’t be something she easily forgot.

‘And then it progressed from there, she would struggle to find her way home when she went out walking.’

Miss Mulligan said she was working with the Alzheimer’s Society in order to make people ‘more aware in their daily lives of those who could be suffering with the disease’.
