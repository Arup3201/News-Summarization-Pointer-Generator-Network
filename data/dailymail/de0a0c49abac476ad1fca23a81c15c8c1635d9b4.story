Hull defender Curtis Davies believes Arsenal lack the 'strong, battling players' of Barclays Premier League title rivals Chelsea and Manchester City - and is glad they did not sign powerhouse midfielder Mohamed Diame when they had the chance.

The Tigers were within minutes of inflicting defeat on the misfiring Gunners at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday, before England forward Danny Welbeck netted a stoppage-time equaliser to secure a 2-2 draw.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger accepted his side had failed to match Hull's aerial superiority, which was shown when Abel Hernandez headed the visitors into a 2-1 lead right at the start of the second half.

There was also little Arsenal were able to do to stop Diame marauding into the penalty area to quickly cancel out Alexis Sanchez's opening goal, although the hosts claimed Mathieu Flamini had been pulled back in the build-up, which Hull boss Steve Bruce dismissed as 'an individual piece of grappling'.

Diame joined Hull from West Ham on transfer deadline day, the Senegal midfielder having long been linked with a switch to Arsenal.

Davies is glad the move worked out in Hull's favour.

'Mo has been brilliant. His quality, his composure, he has definitely added to our squad. I was expecting a hustle-and-bustle midfielder, a strong, get-about player. I thought the goals would come but to get four in five is ridiculous,' said Davies.

'Arsenal were meant to get him on about two or three occasions. He nearly went there when he was at Wigan and when he was at West Ham.

'I am not sure if it was something to do with the medicals, so I don't know why it didn't happen - but I am delighted it didn't and that he came to us instead.'

Steve Bruce's men looked on course to claim a 2-1 victory before Welbeck's stoppage-time equaliser

Davies believes Arsenal do lack something, but remain one of the most technically gifted squads in the Premier League, which was highlighted in the 13th minute on Saturday by Sanchez's excellent finish after cutting inside from the right.

'When you compare them to Chelsea and (Man) City, those two have got the quality as well as big, strong, aggressive, athletic players. When you look at Arsenal, I guess they have got the footballers, but you can't really see the strong, battling players,' he said.

'But with the football they play they don't really need that because if you have got the possession more often than not, you don't need to chase the ball and have big, battling midfielders. That is how Arsenal have always done it.

'They got to this level with Wenger playing this football and why should they change it now?'
