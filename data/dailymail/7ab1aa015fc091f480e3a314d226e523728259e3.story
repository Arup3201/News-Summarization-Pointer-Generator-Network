Whether it's a cheeky monkey or a winking smiley, emojis have become a universal language to express how we're feeling.

But one designer claims that these characters fail to convey the emotions felt by introverts, such as the need to sneak off from a party, or to spend time reading.

Now, California-based artist Rebecca Evie Lynch has changed this by creating more than 30 'introjis' that include activities typically associated with time spent alone.

The 'Introjis', created by California-based artist Rebecca Evie Lynch, are designed to help introverts let loved ones know that they need their own space without providing a reason or excuse. Activities shown here include leaving a party without telling anyone, listening to music, reading and recharging

'My boyfriend of three years broke up with me, citing the need for more time alone,' she told Fastcocreate.com.

'I was surprised, as I've always considered myself an introvert, too, but I realised that my enthusiasm about being in a relationship sometimes overshadows my ability to read others' signals.'

Determined to create a better communication system for introverts, Ms Lynch came up with the concept of 'Introji'.

She says this visual language helps let loved ones know 'that you need more time and space' without having to provide a reason.

The series of introjis also have characters that represent distress calls, in order for introverts to express when they are depressed or need company. The left image shows someone drowing. In the centre is a introji to show someone is recharging while the right image depicts 'giving you space'

The left image shows a hangover, the centre image depicts spending time together relaxing, while the right image shows anxiety

Here characters convey activities such as reading, gaming, leaving stressful social situations and sneaking off from a party.

'Introverts tend to find the company of others draining,' explains Ms Lynch. 'But communication isn't a one-way street.

In the series, Ms Lynch designed certain icons with red backgrounds to indicate that the user doesn't want company at the moment.

Meanwhile, images with blue and green backgrounds express that company is welcome.

Ms Lynch is now hoping to transform her concept designs into a free app. 

She has created a Facebook page to get suggestions from introverts on new designs.

People who use emojis in text messages have more sex than those who don't, according to Match.com's annual dating survey.

The Singles in America study polled more than 5,600 single people of all ages, ethnicities, incomes and walks of life; and found that emoji users were more likely to report having sex at least monthly than non-emoji users.

The 'wink' is the most widely used emoji overall, but when you separate men and women, men are more likely to pepper their texts with 'kiss' and 'heart eyes' emojis, while women prefer 'smileys'.

According to biological anthropologist Dr Helen Fisher, who helped lead the study, emojis are popular simply because they help us communicate more effectively in a medium in which sentiments can otherwise fall flat.

'Technology is dramatically changing how we court, but it can’t change the brain systems for romance', she writes for Match.com.

Around 50 per cent of men and women agree that emojis 'show personality' and around 35 per cent of both sexes say they make 'expressing feelings' easier.

Just don't spell your feelings wrong. The study also found that 54 per cent of single women and 36 per cent of men find misspellings and incorrect grammar to be the biggest text message turn-offs.

The eyes have it: The 'wink' is the most widely used emoji overall, but when you separate men and women, men are more likely to pepper their texts with 'kiss' and 'heart eyes' emojis, while women prefer 'smileys'
