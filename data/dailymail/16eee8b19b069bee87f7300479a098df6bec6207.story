Five-star service: Guests about the friendliness of owners Carol-Lynn and Ian Robbins, who are always available with advice, assistance and even bacon sandwiches for a long journey home

Stylish living: The lounge at the world's best hotel for service offers wi-fi internet, music, TV, board games, a well-stocked 'honesty bar' and excellent company

Cosy hideaway: The large, elegant bedrooms are clean and well-appointed and come with splendid sea views

Family business: Carol-Lynn and Ian Robins have only owned the hotel for two years - but they had one just around the corner eight years ago

TripAdvisor’s Travellers’ Choice 
Awards are worked out by analysing reviews by readers and the Lauriston 
Court has more than 400 rated ‘excellent’.

'I say to people who stay here, "No matter what your problem is, I can fix it"'

Proprietor Carol-Lynn Robbins

British seaside hotels have not 
traditionally been known for excellent service. But thanks to the 
dedication and attitude of former nurse Mrs Robbins, 57, and her husband
Ian, 49, they topped the service rankings.

Mother-of-two Mrs Robbins said: ‘I say
to people who stay here, “No matter what your problem is I can fix 
it.”’

The couple pride themselves on the well-equipped rooms and offer a
full breakfast in the overnight price.

Mrs Robbins said she was ‘thrilled’ by
the honour.  The couple start work at 6.30am and keep going until 
bedtime. ‘We are available 24 hours a day and seven days a week for 
whatever our guests want.

'We don’t look upon it as a job, it’s a way of 
life.

'Providing our guests with the best service possible is so important to us, and so it's heart-warming to be recognised by our guests for the work we do to make their stay special,' she added.

Guests awarding the hotel unanimous five-star ratings raved about the delicious, cooked-to-order breakfasts; the 'stunning' sea views; entertainment and friendly advice.

They also praised the readily available tea, coffee - and even bacon sandwich packed lunches - on offer.

Mrs Robins, 57, told Mail Online that she was 'on top of the world' when she heard the news last week.

'It was a shocker. We thought someone was playing tricks.

'It's not a job, it's our life, and I'm only too happy to do what is needed. When we've done our utmost, we're at our most contented.

'We treat people like we'd like to be treated ourselves. It's the simple things.'

Hospitable: Mr and Mrs Robins say the hotel is their life - and it is when they are doing their utmost that they are most contented

Fine dining: Visitors raved about the delicious food at the hotel, especially a dazzling breakfast of yoghurt, fresh fruit, cereals, croissants, juice and all variations of the Full English

The former nurse said she and her husband were always willing to go the extra mile - booking restaurants or doctor's appointments, driving guests to the theatre when it rained and visiting the hospital to check on the handful of people who got seriously ill.

Mrs Robins even helped an elderly lady to get dressed in heavy Highlands regalia for a Scottish wedding.

The couple used to have a hotel 50 yards around the corner, but gave it up when their son Stefan was 10, to spend more time with him.

Mrs Robins went back to nursing and Mr Robins, 49, worked as a kitchen designer for Magnet in Wrexham - but once their son grew up - he is now 18 and at Bangor University - they returned to Llandudno.

'My family used to have a hotel here too,' added Mrs Robins. 'We've always been in the hospitality industry - we had a restaurant in Wrexham at one time.

'But we hadn't completed what we wanted, coming back was something we had to do.

'We've just finished our second refurbishment, but 11 rooms is enough - we like to keep a finger on the pulse and be hands-on.'

Four British establishments made it into TripAdvisor's list of the world's top 10 B&Bs.

Athole Guest House in Bath came second; No1 in St Ives, Cornwall, came third; All Seasons Guest House, Filey, North Yorkshire, sixth; and St Michael's Guest House, Scarborough, North Yorkshire, seventh.

As well as Lauriston Court, The Caribbean in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, got into the top 10 best-bargain hotels - in eighth place.

Airy and light: A pretty bathroom with large wet-room and fluffy towels completes the perfect experience

Overwhelming: The couple have only owned Lauriston Court for two years - but it has still proved an enormous hit with guests

Welsh wonder: The Llandudno hotel also came sixth of the top-10 bargain hotels around the world, as judged by TripAdvisor reviewers

The top UK hotel was Rudding Park in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, while the UK's best small hotel was The Chester Residence in Edinburgh.

London performed well in the UK top 10 luxury hotel list, with five entries. But only one hotel from the UK capital, The Milestone in Kensington, got into the world luxury top 10 - in ninth place.

TripAdvisor spokeswoman Emma Shaw said: 'For the 11th year running, these awards recognise the cream of the crop when it comes to hotels across the globe, according to those that really matter - travellers themselves.

'Yet again, Britain's B&Bs continue to be celebrated as some of the very best in the world, and for a British hotel to beat over 650,000 others to be named number one in the world for service really is something to be proud of.'

Room was spotlessly clean and lovely 
and warm with a sea view looking out at the pier, parking is never a 
problem, breakfast is wonderful with loads of choice to suit everyone, I
have and always will highly recommend this hotel.

We have just spent a few days at 
Lauriston Court Hotel in Llandudno and once more have had a wonderful 
time there. It was our third visit and we are already looking forward to
our next one. We can honestly say it is the best bed and breakfast 
hotel we have stayed at.

very friendly and welcoming. The breakfast was superb! Don't bother 
booking anywhere else!!

We will definitely be returning
with our children. We had a superb sea view from room 7 - the views 
stunning. The breakfast was the best i have sampled in any hotel with 
lovely quality produce. The location is a prime spot right next to the 
pier.

Breakfast was fabulous. Fresh fruits,
yoghurts, cereals, juice, croissants, and any variation of an English 
breakfast that you wanted was catered for. Tea and coffee offered as 
soon as you entered the dining room. There was a lovely lounge area with
an honesty bar. Internet and wi-fi, board games, music, TV and 
Carol-Lynn or Ian were always very attentive. We were given bacon 
sandwiches to come home with. We can't praise this hotel enough.
