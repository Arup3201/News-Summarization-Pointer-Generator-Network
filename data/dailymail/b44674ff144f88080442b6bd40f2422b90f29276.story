remove an internal obstacle that stands between ourselves and the 
unlimited happiness that is our real destiny.'

Two days before their campfire heart-to-heart they attended a Kabbalah service in Los Angeles together.

Though
they sat on opposite sides of the aisle, Kutcher greeted his wife with a
hug after the service, and they reportedly walked out with their arms 
round each other.

They have also been spotted wearing their wedding rings.
