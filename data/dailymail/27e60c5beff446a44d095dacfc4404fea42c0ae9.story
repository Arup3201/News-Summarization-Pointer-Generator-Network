A dog named Buddy more than lived up to his moniker over the weekend, when he rescued his owner from afire.

Jacob Martin was sleeping Sunday when a fire broke out in the house he was renovating next door to his home in Mansfield, Ohio.

His pit-bull Buddy started barking, waking him up just in time to escape and save his own home from the spreading flames .

Lifesaver: Jacob Martin nearly slept through a house fire over the weekend, but was saved when his dog Buddy barked to wake him up

Crucial: The fire broke out at a house Martin was renovating next to home he lived in. Buddy woke Martin up with enough time to escape and stop the other home from burning to the ground

Sad: Unfortunately, Martin is afraid he may not be able to keep Buddy since due to the fire and the fact he recently lost a job

'The heat melted the door,' Martin told Fox 8 Cleveland. 'I actually burnt my hand trying to open the door.'

Martin was renovating the home next door and had spent $1,500 on new additions, which were completely lost after the fire burnt the building to the ground.

He did not have rental insurance.

But Martin is just glad to be alive, and gives all the thanks to Buddy.

'Buddy is the best dog I ever had, great dog and good company,' he said.

The dog's instinct to protect his new master is perhaps more surprising considering Martin had only adopted him a month and a half previously.

Martin adopted him from a co-worker who found the dog in a home vacated by a neighbor in the middle of the night.

Now Martin fears he may not be able to keep Buddy because he recently lost a job and the fire has taken a toll on his funds.

Firefighters are still investigating what caused the home to become engulfed in flames, but don't believe it was intentionally started.
