It might set Piano Man Elton John rocking new melodies or send Beethoven batty, but for one pianist this baby grand will literally move with their music.

The world’s only rocking piano is up for auction this weekend and expected to fetch a swinging £1500. 

The modified, one-off baby grand piano called Chichi was created by award-winning British designer Sarah Davenport Design with a specially made wooden frame which surrounds the instrument and encompasses the seat and pedals.

Rock while you roll: The revolutionary design of this modified baby grand piano allows the player to literally move with the music

Captive audience: Kay Tedford (pictured) from John Pye Auctioneers had a wobbly start when she first tickled the ivories.

The musician can rock while they play, a revolutionary way of interacting with this interesting instrument.

It is under the hammer by auctioneers John Pye and Sons in Nottingham with bidding open from July 7 to 9.

Kay Tedford from John Pye Auctioneers said: ‘I was very excited when I found out we had the piano up for auction.

‘I’m
a self-taught pianist but I can play well so I got straight on and had a
go - and nearly fell off because I wasn’t ready for it to rock!’

Rolling on: The piano has changed dramatically since its days in the home of the ambassador of Hong Kong

Piano-playing singer songwriter 
Jamie Cullum had wanted the revolutionary piano until he found he could 
not fit it into his studio.

Created from veneered Canadian rock maple wood and due its cut-out frame, it is possible to see the strings and soundboard while being played.

The piano dates back to the early 1900s when it was owned by the ambassador of Hong Kong.

The modified design came into conception in 2007 and gained widespread appeal because of the unique way that the player can control movement as well as the music.
