Accessing the Dark Web, where drugs and weapons can be purchased at the click of a button, just got easier with the launch of a search engine based on Google.

Grams, which was launched last week, appears to have modeled itself closely on Google, from the brightly colored logo to the 'I Feel Lucky' search button.

Unlike the mainstream search engine however, those wanting to use Grams have to access the Tor browser that provides an extra level of anonymity.

Web search: Grams may look like Google but it helps users find drugs and guns

The site works by searching multiple illicit websites such as SilkRoad2, Pandora and The Pirate Market, which are known for providing access to stolen credit cards, fake IDs and drugs.

Previously, accessing those sites would have meant knowing the exact URL to type in.

'I noticed on the forums and reddit 
people were constantly asking "where to get product X?" and "which 
market had product X?" or "who had the best product X and was reliable 
and not a scam?",' the creator, who asked to remain anonymous, told Wired.

'I wanted
 to make it easy for people to find things they wanted on the "darknet" 
and figure out who was a trustworthy vendor.'

Going underground: Grams collects search results for illicit websites, similar to drug site Silk Road which was closed by the FBI last year

When a search request is entered into Grams, it returns a list of results showing the name of the seller, their location, and the price of the product.

The site will also help users track down sites that have been closed by agencies such as the FBI, which closed Silk Road - where illegal drugs could allegedly be traded - last year.

Other functions of Gram mirror Google, such as space to leave reviews, and the development of an advertising tool to allow sellers to pay for a more prominent listing.
