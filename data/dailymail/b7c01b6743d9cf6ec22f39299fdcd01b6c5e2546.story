Sipping beer in a quaint brasserie, frolicking under the Eiffel Tower and taking a sneaky peek at a painting of a naked woman, this is 1950's Paris as seen through the lens of photographer Robert Doisneau.

Part of a new book celebrating the legendary photographer's work, the photos offer a glimpse of a world where the ladies were glamorous and the cigarettes plentiful and nearly always Gauloise.

Doisneau, who died in 1994, made his name in the 1930's and specialised in roaming the streets of the French capital, Leica camera in hand, to capture intimate tableaux featuring the city's residents.

Famous: Doisneau's most famous photograph is 'Le baiser de l'hôtel de ville' (the kiss outside City Hall) which was taken in 1950

Striking: This photograph, taken in the 1950s, shows customers, including a newly married couple, enjoying a drink in a brasserie

Most famous of all his works is 'Le baiser de l'hôtel de ville' [the kiss outside City Hall], which shows a passionate couple puckering up in the middle of a milling crowd, and is among the 400 photos in the new tome titled, simply, Robert Doisneau.

Like his contemporary Henri Cartier-Bresson, much of Doisneau's work focused on the ordinary and the mundane, although many of his photographs focus on Paris' street children at play.

Their seemingly happy childhoods were a world away from his own, which came to an abrupt end at the age of four when his plumber father was killed on active duty during World War I.

Brought up by his widowed mother until the age of seven, he then suffered a further tragedy when she died - leaving him to be brought up by an aunt variously described as 'unloving' and 'cold'. 

Favourite: Doisneau was particularly well known for his playful photographs of children, among them this shot taken beneath the Eiffel Tower

Working girl: This beautifully composed shot taken in 1947 shows a woman enjoying the sunshine with a typewriter balanced on her knees

Despite his struggles at home, Doisneau proved an adept student, in particular in art and craft, and when he graduated in 1929, got a job as a draughtsman in an advertising agency.

The agency, Atelier Ullmann, also had a photography studio and Doisneau, who first got his hands on a camera aged 16, was eventually able to switch jobs and become an assistant photographer.

After a stint working as an assistant to modernist photographer André Vigneau, Doisneau struck out on his own, selling his first photograph to Excelsior magazine in 1932.

Work as an industrial photographer for Renault followed, as did a brief period photographing for postcards. In 1939 came Doisneau's big break - a contract with photographic agency Rapho. 

When war broke out months later, he was drafted into the French army as both soldier and photographer and spent much of the following year taking pictures of soldiers. 

Sneak peek: This knowing shot shows a gendarme (policeman) taking a sneaky look at a painting of a naked woman 

Back for another look! The gendarme wasn't the only man to be caught enjoying a quick look at the naked lady by Doisneau 

And again! This gentleman, wearing a neat black Homburg hat, appears pleased to catch a glimpse of the painting

Ordinary: Much of Doisneau's work focused on ordinary people going about their lives, such as this pair of women 

Following the fall of France, he joined the French Resistance, using his draughtmanship and photography skills to create false passports for agents and those who needed to escape.

Despite his wartime heroics, Doisneau is most famous for his post-war career, in particular his 1950's street scenes which focused on ordinary people going about their daily lives.

Doisneau, who lived in the southern Paris suburb of Gentilly for most of his life, never stopped taking photos, although the rise of television in the 1970's left him with fewer magazine clients and forced a move into celebrity portraits.

Nevertheless, despite the huge stars who sat for him in his studio, Doisneau, who died aged 81 in 1994, never lost his passion for the Paris streets where his life as a photographer began. 

Tough lesson: Doisneau caught this young child looking pained as he attempts to work out his sums in a class

Stern: A woman looks out from the doorway of her home, peering sternly at Doisneau's camera 

Risque: Another knowing photograph, this shows a man relaxing with a cigarette and a wall-full of pornographic photos
