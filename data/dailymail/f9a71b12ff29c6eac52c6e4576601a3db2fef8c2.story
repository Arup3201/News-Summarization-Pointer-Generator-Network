It is one of the major questions in the battle of the sexes: who is the better driver? And it seems the answer is men, at least at the learner stage.

The Driving Standards Agency has revealed women made 857,000 major errors in their driving tests last year compared with men, who made 646,000 mistakes.

The report found women were most likely to fail for poor reverse parking, steering mistakes and botched gear changes.

But men were more likely to lose track of their speed and fail for driving too fast.

Both of the sexes had problems with spotting hazards at road junctions and forgetting to check their rearview mirrors.

But despite the bad news, it appears women are actually better drivers once they have got a bit of experience.

Female drivers are up to 20 per cent safer than men once they have passed their test, according to a recent study.

Researchers analysed results from more than 154million miles of travel.

Half the drivers were men and half were women. Experts found women were 28 per cent less likely to drive at night and 12 per cent less likely to break the speed limit than their male counterparts.

Insurance figures show one third of all car accidents happen within a mile of the driver's home

A third of all car accidents happen 
within a mile of the driver’s home – and skipping breakfast could be the
 cause, according to  a report.

Insurance figures show that accidents peak between 8am and 9am, as millions of Britons climb into their cars and set off on the daily commute or school run.

But the research found drivers who make time for breakfast are not as likely to get involved in an accident. They performed 30 per cent better in a driving simulation compared to people who missed out on their first meal of the day.

Rory Carlin from Halfords Autocentre, which commissioned the research, said: ‘Taking that extra few minutes to prepare for your journey in the morning can make all the difference and help make the roads safer for everyone.

‘Whether going to work or travelling further afield, preparing yourself with a hearty breakfast could be just as important as making sure your car is prepared.’
