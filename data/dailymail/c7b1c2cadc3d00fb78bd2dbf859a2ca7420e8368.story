A 40-year-old man has been charged with murdering his ex-girlfriend and scattering her body parts in rivers around his city.

Guang Hua Liu's head, foot and hands were discovered in a river west of Toronto earlier this month. Days later, her calves, a thigh and an arm were found in a creek in the east of the city.

Qi Jiang, whose four-year relationship with Miss Liu had recently ended, was arrested on Sunday and charged with second-degree murder.

Mother-of-three Miss Liu, 41, was last seen alive on August 10 when she was dropped off by friends at the holistic spa she owned.

Jiang, a construction worker, lived close to the townhouse Miss Liu lived in with her eldest son, the court heard.

Her two younger children live with their father.

The couple both emigrated from China in 2002.

Miss Liu’s 21-year-old son told Chinese-language newspaper Ming Pao that his mother had a complicated love life and had recently split up with a 'Caucasian professional' - one of several men she had been dating, according to the Toronto Star.

A week ago, neighbours noticed the basement door to Jiang's townhouse was left wide open for several days and his car was dented at the front and on the side.

A few days later they noticed a man bent over a bucket 'scrubbing' in Jiang’s backyard and on Sunday, police swarmed the neighbourhood and cordoned off his home.

The disturbing case received extra attention because it bears a striking resemblance to the story of porn actor and murder suspect Luka Magnotta.

He made the headlines earlier this year for allegedly dismembering a Chinese student in Montreal and mailing the body parts to political parties and a school.

Police have ruled out any 
connection between the cases.

They still do not know how Miss Liu died and parts of her body have yet to be recovered.

Her ex-boyfriend will appear again in court on September 10.
