The new series of Toddlers & Tiaras aired last night, and true to form it presented a whole new set of shocking behaviours from fame-hungry pageant parents.

The hit TLC show, which has focused on child beauty pageants in Texas and Maryland in the past, launched its new season in New York where we met Isabella, five-years-old and Shian, eight-years-old and their mothers.

The new season also marked the return of three-year-old Paisley, who famously sparked outrage from viewers when her mother dressed her in a Pretty Woman prostitute costume last year.

Too much: Eight-year-old Shian is made to carry weights by her mother Trisma as she runs around the block in preparation for her pageant performance. She is just one of the extreme stars of TLC's Toddlers & Tiaras

Shian, from
New Jersey is shown carrying purple weights as she runs around the block in preparation for her
pageant appearance. The behaviour is guided by her mother Trisma.

The mother also reveals she makes her daughter sleep in a girdle at night.

In one scene, when her family are fussing about with her costume, Shian says: 'I can't breathe.'

Isabella, from Rhode Island looks to be 
the strongest contender for Paisley's crown. The youngster is seen being
carefully coached in diva-like expressions by her mother, Susanna, who 
admits to spending $40,000 in the past eight months alone on her 
daughter's beauty pageants.

Tough conditions: Trisma ensures Shian is completing her exercises correctly, looking on as she works out

One pink frock that spurts showgirl-style feathers at the shoulders is shown on the child. The dress has been encrusted with about 3000 crystals.

Isabella says of it: 'My beauty dress cost $5,000!'

Susanna,
who lives vicariously through her little girl, has also provided 
Isabella with her own Glitzy Girl jewellery line. The mother is also 
shown feeding her daughter packets of straight sugar when her 
concentration begins to slip.

'We lost her,' she said

'Seeing her blow it is like blowing the world series.'

Energy: Isabella is also fed packets of sugar by her mother to get a high energy performance from the toddler

Shian's
mother is no less dramatic. She kicks up a stink when she 
discovers there are more contestants in her daughter's competition than
she had been led to believe. She caves in to Shian's tantrum over not 
being allowed to get scary child-damaging false nails.

Luckily for this tot, Shian appears wise to her mother's ways. She says: 'My mom's a crazy pageant mom.'

Shian
also reveals she would rather spend the money Trisma puts towards her 
pageant costumes on the family's broken gate in the yard.

Of course, the controversial three-year-old Paisley and her mother, Wendy Dickey from Georgia steal the show.

Harmful: Paisley, the three-year-old who was dressed as a prostitute last year, returns to Toddlers & Tiaras with a new Lady Gaga-inspired outfit. The Parents Television Council said it was a 'gross sexualisation'

Inappropriate: The child's outfit featured a black biker hat, tall biker boots and off the shoulder leopard print. Crimped hair and the odd high kick completed the look

Paisley arrives to the Darling Divas’ New York, New
York-themed pageant in her own tiny motorised car. She also totes a Chanel-emblazoned hangbag.

Her new 'talent manager', Blake Woodruff of New York’s Prestige Management Group, says: 'We showed New York what our Georgia peach can do.'

Mr Woodruff's triumph is then contrasted with footage of Paisley picking her nose.

Her mother's wardrobe choice is again controversial. On stage, Paisley removes a 'Lady 
Gaga-inspired' tutu skirt off to reveal black suspenders and leopard 
print tights.

She explains to Mr Woodruff that her daughter is in 'Samantha mode', referring to the promiscuous Sex And The City character.

'Hopefully they 
won't be calling her prosti-tot again,' Mrs Dickey says in reference to the 
sheer mesh midriff stitched into Paisley's outfit.

The Parents 
Television Council has expressed outrage over Mrs Dickey's behaviour, 
describing the footage as 'dangerous and harmful'.

Melissa Henson, Director of Communications and Public
Education, said: ‘The gross sexualisation of a child itself is reprehensible.

'It is sending her and all of the other
little girls in the competition and who might be watching at home, dangerous
and harmful messages about how to attract attention.'

Paisley is also taken to LOL Kids, a high-end
European children’s boutique, prior to her performance in the pageant. A week’s
worth of fashionable outfits for the toddler are hand-picked for her by New York stylist Stacie Fitzgerald.
