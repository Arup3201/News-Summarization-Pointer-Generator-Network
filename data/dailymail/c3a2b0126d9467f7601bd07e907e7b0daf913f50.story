President Barack Obama
has scaled back his ambitions for a sweeping budget bargain with 
Republicans.

Instead, he's calling for a limited measure sufficient to 
prevent the government from careening off the 'fiscal cliff' in January 
by extending tax cuts for most taxpayers and forestalling a painful set 
of agency budget cuts.

In a White House 
appearance Friday, Obama also called on Congress to extend jobless 
benefits for the long-term unemployed that would otherwise be cut off 
for 2 million people at the end of the year.

Obama's
announcement was a recognition that chances for a larger agreement 
before year's end have probably collapsed.

It also suggested that any 
chance for a smaller deal may rest in the Senate, particularly after the
collapse of a plan by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, to permit tax
rates to rise on million-dollar-plus incomes.

'In the next few days,
I've asked leaders of Congress to work toward a package that prevents a
tax hike on middle-class Americans, protects unemployment insurance for
2 million Americans, and lays the groundwork for further work on both 
growth and deficit reduction,' Obama said. 'That's an achievable goal. 
That can get done in 10 days.'

Maybe, maybe 
not. The latest plan faces uncertainty at best in the sharply divided 
Senate. GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who wields great power 
even in the minority, called Friday for Senate action on a House bill 
from the summer extending the full menu of Bush-era tax cuts.

He 
promised that it will take GOP votes for anything to clear the Senate, 
where 60 votes are required to advance most legislation. Democrats 
control 53 votes.

Boehner, giving the GOP 
weekly radio address, said, 'Of course, hope springs eternal, and I know
we have it in us to come together and do the right thing.'

The president called on congressional leaders to work out a solution on the fiscal cliff over the Christmas break. He also said 'because we didn't get this done, I will see you next week.'

Earlier,
Boehner said Obama needs to give more ground to reach an agreement and 
that both he and Obama had indicated in a Monday telephone call that 
their latest offers represented their bottom lines.

'How we get there,' 
he added, 'God only knows.'

Congress shut down
for Christmas and Obama flew to Hawaii with his family for the 
holidays. But both men indicated they'd be back in Washington, working 
to beat the fast-approaching Jan. 1 deadline with an agreement between 
Christmas and New Year's.

Obama announced his 
plans after talking by phone with Boehner and meeting with Senate 
Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., who had previously pinned his hopes 
on an Obama-Boehner agreement and is wary of dealing with McConnell.

At
the White House, Obama projected optimism despite of weeks of failed 
negotiations.

'Call me a hopeless optimist, but I actually still think 
we can get it done,' he said.

Boehner spoke in
the morning, describing the increasingly tangled attempts to beat the 
Jan. 1 deadline and head off the perilous combination of 
across-the-board tax hikes and deep spending cuts.

'Because
of the political divide in the country, because of the divide here in 
Washington, trying to bridge these differences has been difficult,' 
Boehner said. 'If it were easy, I guarantee you this would have been 
done decades before.'

Obama said that in his 
negotiations with Boehner, he had offered to meet Republicans halfway 
when it came to taxes and 'more than halfway' toward their target for 
spending cuts.

It's clear, however, that 
there's great resistance in GOP ranks to forging a bargain with Obama 
along the lines of a possible agreement that almost seemed at hand just a
few days ago: tax hikes at or just over $1 trillion over 10 years, 
matched by comparable cuts to federal health care programs, Social 
Security benefits and across federal agency operating budgets.

Obama
said he remains committed to working toward a goal of longer-term 
deficit reduction to reduce chronic trillion-dollar deficits while 
keeping tax rates in place for nearly everyone.

'Even
though Democrats and Republicans are arguing about whether those rates 
should go up for the wealthiest individuals, all of us - every single 
one of us - agrees that tax rates shouldn't go up for the other 98 
percent of Americans,' Obama said, citing statistics associated with his
promise to protect household income under $250,000 from higher tax 
rates.

Neither the House nor the Senate is 
expected to meet again until after Christmas. Officials in both parties 
said there was still time to prevent the changes from kicking in with 
the new year.

The week began amid optimism 
that Obama and Boehner had finally begun to significantly narrow their 
differences.

Both were offering a cut in taxes for most Americans, an 
increase for a relative few, and cuts of roughly $1 trillion in spending
over a year.

Also included was a provision to scale back future 
cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients - a concession 
by the president that inflamed many liberals..

GOP
officials said some senior Republicans such as Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., 
the most recent Republican vice presidential nominee, opposed the 
possible agreement.

But No. 2 House Republican Eric Cantor of Virginia 
has joined arms with Boehner.

Boehner stepped 
back and announced what he called Plan B, legislation to let tax rates 
rise on incomes of $1 million or more while preventing increases for all
other taxpayers.

Despite statements of 
confidence, he and his lieutenants decided late Thursday they were not 
going to be able to secure the votes needed to pass the measure in the 
face of opposition from conservatives unwilling to violate decades-old 
party orthodoxy never to raise tax rates.

The 
retreat came after it became clear that too many Republicans feared 'the
perception that somebody might accuse them of raising taxes,' Boehner 
said.

Boehner also said that last Monday he had told Obama he had submitted his bottom-line proposal.

'The
president told me that his numbers - the $1.3 trillion in new revenues,
$850 billion in spending cuts - was his bottom line, that he couldn't 
go any further.'

That contradicted remarks by 
White House press secretary Jay Carney, who said on Thursday that Obama 
has 'never said either in private or in public that this was his final 
offer. He understands that to reach a deal it would require some further
negotiation. There is not much further he could go.'final offer. He understands that to reach a deal it would require
