A measles outbreak that began at Disneyland last month has now spread to at least 95 people across the US.

Health officials in Arizona are monitoring 1,000 people to try and stop the spread of the highly contagious virus, including nearly 200 children who could have been exposed at a Phoenix medical center last week.

Those who haven't been vaccinated have been warned to stay at home for 21 days or, if they must go out in public, to wear a mask.

Arizona is second only to California in the number of cases traced back to the Disney theme park last month with measles confirmed in five other states- Utah, Washington, Colorado, Oregon and Nebraska - as well as Mexico.

'To stay in your house for 21 days is hard,' said Arizona State Health Services director Will Humble. 'But we need people to follow those recommendations, because all it takes is a quick trip to the Costco before you're ill and, 'bam,' you've just exposed a few hundred people.

'We're at a real critical juncture with the outbreak.'

Mr Humble said it's possible but unlikely that the number of cases can be contained at seven.

Health officials do not yet know  how many of the children were vaccinated, or their age ranges but say they are working to notify the families who visited the Phoenix Children's East Valley Center between January 20-21.

Children under a year old cannot receive the vaccination for measles, mumps and rubella but can get an immunity booster.

An Arizona woman, whose case was confirmed on Tuesday in Maricopa County, had come into contact with a family from Pinal County who had recently traveled to Disneyland. 

She contracted the virus but was not exhibiting the tell-tale symptoms like a rash when she visited the Phoenix Children's East Valley Center.

Maricopa County health director Bob England declined to say whether the woman had been vaccinated- which isn't 100 percent effective in stemming the spread of the disease.

'Unfortunately, she came down with the disease and by the time it was recognized had already exposed a large number of children at the facility,' he said.

Most of those infected were not vaccinated leading to criticism of a small but vocal movement among parents to opt out of vaccinations for their children. Health experts have urged people to get the mumps-measles-rubella, or MMR vaccine shot. 

Mr England said health officials will check in with the families of the children following the 21-day incubation period, which ends on February 12. He added that most parents understood the importance of keeping their children home.

Phoenix Children's spokeswoman Debra Stevens asked  anyone who suspects they might have measles  to call ahead to allow staff to take the necessary precautions to help keep measles from spreading, including bringing masks to incoming patients.

People who haven't been vaccinated against measles, including children too young to be immunized, were warned last week to avoid the theme park

'If someone has chosen not to vaccinate their children or for some reason cannot vaccinate their children, they face a higher responsibility now to let their health care provider know in advance,' she said.

Meanwhile, masks are being placed outside health care facilities and signs went up outside a handful of places in the town of Kearny, in Arizona, warning customers and employees that they could have been exposed to measles. 

A man who is recovering from measles also came into contact with the Pinal County family that visited Disneyland. Gila County health officials say they are tracking 17 people who were at a hospital in Globe in the same time frame as a person confirmed to have measles.

The US experienced a record number of measles cases last year, with 644 infections from 27 states despite being largely eliminated in 2000.
