The world's longest neutrino experiment has begun its probe into the mysteries of 'ghostly' particles that may hold the key to understanding the universe.

The machine, called Nova, is made up of two huge detectors – placed 500 miles (800km) apart – to study one of nature's most elusive subatomic particles.

Scientists believe that a better understanding of neutrinos, one of the most abundant and difficult-to-study particles, may lead to a clearer picture of the inner workings of the universe.

The world's longest neutrino experiment has begun its probe into the mysteries of ghostly particles that may hold the key to understanding the universe.The machine, called Nova, is made up of two huge detectors – placed 500 miles (800km) apart – to study one of nature's most elusive subatomic particle

Using the world's most powerful beam of neutrinos, generated at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory near Chicago, the machine can precisely record a neutrinos tell-tale traces.

Tiny and nearly mass-less, neutrinos are everywhere and about 100 trillion pass through us harmlessly each second.

They were created by the Big Bang and form in the sun and our own bodies, but they move so fast and small that scientists have barely detected them for study.

'Of the known particles, the neutrinos as a group are the most oddball,' said Steven Ritz of the University of California, Santa Cruz. Neutrinos are a group because they come in three types, or "flavours",and they can shift from one type to another, but scientists don't quite know why.

Neutrinos interact so weakly with other matter that billions of them pass through our bodies every second without leaving a trace.

They are the most mysterious of the known particles in the universe and could help unravel huge mysteries, such as why the cosmos is made of matter.

But these elusive particles may also help scientists solve puzzles closer to home - including where exactly nuclear weapons are being made.

Scientists at the College of Science at Virginia Tech are investigating just how accurate neutrinos are when detecting nuclear activity.

It follows previous studies, such as a project by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratory, that created prototype neutrino detectors to sniff out nuclear weapons.

Neutrinos are produced by the decay of radioactive elements, and nuclear reactors produce large amounts of neutrinos that cannot be shielded or disguised.

Measuring neutrino emissions allows scientists to know the plutonium content of a reactor from outside the building, according to the researchers.

'By making moderate improvements in existing neutrino-detector technology, we can fit a detector system into a standard 20ft (7 metre) shipping container to monitor the Iranian heavy water reactor at Arak as part of a non-proliferation measure,' said Patrick Huber, an associate professor of physics at Virgin Tech.

If a neutrino is eventually beamed from Chicago, 'it starts out as a chocolate milkshake, but it's partly strawberry by the time it gets to South Dakota,' said Joe Lykken, a particle theorist at Fermi National Accelerator Lab.

Neutrinos could give scientists clues about the mysterious dark matter of outer space and other strange astrophysical phenomena.

Nova's particle detectors were both constructed in the path of the neutrino beam sent from Fermilab in Batavia, Illinois, to northern Minnesota.

The 300-ton near detector, installed underground at the laboratory, observes the neutrinos as they embark on their near-light-speed journey through the Earth.

The 14,000-ton far detector spots those neutrinos after their 500-mile trip and allows scientists to analyse how they change over that long distance.

For the next six years, Fermilab will send tens of thousands of billions of neutrinos every second in a beam aimed at both detectors, and scientists expect to catch only a few each day in the far detector, so rarely do neutrinos interact with matter.

From this data, scientists hope to learn more about how and why neutrinos change between one type and another.

The far detector in Minnesota is believed to be the largest free-standing plastic structure in the world, at 200ft (60 metres) long, 50ft (15 metres) high and 50ft (15 metres) wide.

Both detectors are constructed from PVC and filled with a scintillating liquid that gives off light when a neutrino interacts with it.

Fiber optic cables transmit that light to a computer, which creates 3D pictures of those interactions for scientists to analyse.

Scientists will also probe the still-unknown masses of the three types of neutrinos in an attempt to determine which is the heaviest.
