Millions more Britons could be given statins to cut their risk of heart attacks and strokes after US guidelines recommended a third of adults should take them.

The new advice tells doctors to consider a patient’s lifetime risk and may result in a doubling of prescriptions.

It will be closely monitored by British experts who are preparing two updated sets of guidelines on statin use.

But the number of people taking the drugs in the UK is unlikely to increase by as much as in the States.

Dr David Wald, consultant cardiologist at Barts and the London Hospital, said: ‘The new guidelines widen access to statin treatment.

‘This recognises the effectiveness of statins in reducing the risk of heart attacks and strokes, their safety and the availability of lower-cost generic statins, which makes prevention more affordable.

‘It is a sensible step forward and it would be sensible for Britain to follow by introducing policies that simplify as well as broaden access to statin treatment.’

Eight million Britons take statins, up from five million a decade ago.

But experts believe many more should be on them. Heart disease – which includes heart attacks and strokes  – claims 82,000 lives annually.

Last year, Oxford researchers claimed 2,000 lives could be saved annually if they were prescribed more widely.

At present, GPs and cardiologists decide whether to prescribe statins mainly by looking at a patient’s cholesterol level – the fatty deposits in blood that clog arteries.

But the guidance issued in America yesterday urges doctors to consider patients’ overall risk of heart attacks and strokes based on their age, whether they smoke, their weight and their gender.

That may lead to more women being offered the drugs because they are more likely to have strokes than men.

Statins are recommended for 15 per cent of adults in the US, but if doctors follow the guidelines they would be prescribed to 30 per cent – 22 per cent of women and 44 per cent of men.

Dr Mike Knapton, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said experts drawing up the guidelines for the NHS would be looking closely at the US recommendations, drawn up by the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology.

But he said it was too early to say how many more patients here would take statins as a result.

He said: ‘I don’t know what effect we will see but my suspicion is it will increase.

‘But I’d be very surprised if it led to a doubling in the numbers of patients.’

Experts from the Joint British Societies of Guidelines are due to publish recommendations for GPs and cardiologists on how they should prescribe statins.

In July next year, the NHS rationing watchdog, NICE, will produce further guidance setting out when doctors should use them.

Both are expected to tell doctors to consider patients whole-life risk of heart attacks and strokes – as in the US guidelines – rather than simply focusing on cholesterol levels.

Last year there were 61million prescriptions in England for statins, which cost as little as £16 for a 12-month course.

They work by reducing the cholesterol in the arteries, and are normally given to patients with high cholesterol following a heart attack, stroke or bypass.

Around one million prescriptions for statins are written each week, compared with just a few thousand in 1981.

Statins make up nearly a fifth of all drugs prescribed for heart and circulatory disease in England.

The drugs reduce blood levels of cholesterol, which can build up inside arteries, damaging them and raising the risk of heart disease and stroke.

They may also protect against other health problems, including blood clots and eye disorders, by maintaining a healthy blood supply to the brain.

The most serious adverse reaction is myopathy in about one in 1,000 patients, which can result in muscle pain and weakness.
