Controversial Facebook pages that pit good looking children against each other in a bid to find the 'most beautiful teenagers' have been branded as 'bait for paedophiles'.

Several contests have been set up in recent weeks inviting youngsters to post provocative pictures of themselves so they can be rated by other users.

Hundreds of boys are seen posing without their tops on, while girls as young as 12 pout for the camera wearing skimpy outfits or bikinis.

The one who receives the most votes each week is then named 'most beautiful teen'.

Controversial: Facebook pages that pit good looking children against each other in a bid to find the 'most beautiful teenagers' have been branded as 'bait for paedophiles'

Suggestive: Several pages have been set up in recent weeks inviting youngsters to post provocative pictures of themselves so they can be rated by other users

But the seemingly innocent past-time has sparked a rash of complaints from parents - who say online predators will use the pages for 'the wrong reasons'.

They are also angry about the comments posted by 'internet trolls' on some of the photos - which has seen young girls and boys labelled as 'fat', 'too ugly' and 'disgusting'.

Other comments on 'contestants' include: 'I wouldn't touch her with a 10ft pole', 'her nose is too big' and 'pluck dem eyebrows gurl'.

A backlash by Facebook users saw the site shut down the 'most beautiful teenager in the world' page, which had almost 100,000 users, earlier this week.

Taken down: This page has been partially deleted by Facebook after complaints from parents and security experts

Problem: But a host of other similar pages have sprung up in its place

Facebook said the page violated its statement of rights and responsibilities and added: 'We don't tolerate bullying and take action on content reported to us which we categorise as such.'

But a raft of similar sites have sprung up in its place.

A disabled teenager targeted after posting a photo of herself on one of the pages has launched a campaign against the bullies.

Andie Proskus, 19, said she was not letting the incident 'bring her down'.

And she and now wants others 'to know there is help you can get and things do get better'.

Wheelchair-bound Proskus, from Portland, Oregon, who has the muscle weakening disorder myopathy, added: 'I stand up for myself and others who are getting bullied.

They include 'Teenage Natural Beauty Contest', 'Competition for the most beautiful teenager' and 'Competition for the most beautiful teenager in Europe'.

A mother from Wigan, England, issued a warning after she saw suggestive remarks posted under photographs of her daughter on one of the pages.

Paula Jones told WiganToday.net that, underneath a photo of 12-year-old Michaela, were comments from two men.

She said: 'One was asking how old she was and then one asked if she knew what a paedophile was and to look it up.

'She deleted her photo and left the group. When I clicked on the link there were lots of young girls, of a similar age.

'There were some very crude and suggestive remarks and men asking girls to add them as Facebook friends.

'These girls are only young and would take the comments as a nice compliment and not know what they are getting into.'

Issues: The seemingly innocent past-time has sparked a rash of complaints from parents - who say online predators will use the pages for 'absolutely the wrong reason'

Abuse: Parents are also angry about the comments posted by 'internet trolls' on some of the photos - which has seen young girls and boys labelled as 'fat', 'too ugly' and 'disgusting'

Paula's friend Joanne Boxell added: 'The stuff written on the site is disgusting. We have tried to report it but the person who runs this Most Beautiful Teens group keeps changing the site details.

'It just isn't normal and girls and their parents need to be warned and made aware of this.'

Concerned Marcy Kemp-Rank, whose 15-year-old daughter Amy posted a picture on the site, also said she was 'horrified' by some of the comments.

She told ABC News: 'She read them [the comments] to me, several of them. I couldn’t handle hearing them because it just made me very upset and angry.

'I think that was a good thing they took it down.  I think it was a way of bullying.'

And the British based Child Exploitation and Online Protection (CEOP) Centre also warned children of online dangers.

A spokesman said: 'Children and young people always need to think very carefully about the information, videos and pictures they put online or exchange with friends. 

'You can pass over ownership and therefore lose control of anything published and anyone can then change or share the images. They may be used to bully you or something worse and the effects can be lifelong and devastating.

'CEOP’s Thinkuknow education programme helps children and young people to understand the risks they may face when online, empowering them with the awareness to protect themselves. For more information, please visit www.thinkuknow.co.uk.

'The ClickCEOP button, available on hundreds of websites, provides direct access to CEOP’s advice pages as well as the opportunity to report suspicious or inappropriate contact online direct to the CEOP Centre. See www.ceop.police.uk.'

Some Facebook users have also complained that their photos have been uploaded to the open pages, which can be seen by all of the sites 845million users, without their permission.

Worrying trend: These are just some of the Facebook pages asking children to send in their photos to be rated by fellow users
