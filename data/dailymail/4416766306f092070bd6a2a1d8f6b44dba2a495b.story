A new survey investigating the toll of a big weekend on workplace productivity, has found that almost one in ten people have gone to work while still under the influence of illegal drugs.

The survey of 1000 Victorians by the Australian Drug Foundation also found that one in five people have come to work while tipsy or drunk.

One in five also admitted to taking a sickie from work due to the effects of alcohol while 40 per cent of respondents said they had gone to work while still feeling the general effects of drinking.

A survey of 1000 Victorians by the Australian Drug Foundation, found that one in five people have come to work while tipsy or drunk and nearly one in 10 have turned up still feeling the effects of illegal drugs

The ADF's head of workplace services, Phillip Collins, said the effects of drinking on the weekend can greatly impact a person's performance at work.

'From an individual perspective, most people don't fully understand the effect alcohol has on them - particularly when it comes to drinks one night having an impact well into the next day,' Mr Collins said.

'Alcohol affects a person's concentration, coordination, decision making ability and slows reaction times. These can have implications for workplace safety and productivity.'

Mr Collins also clarified that drug use over the weekend is as equally problematic in the workplace the following day.

'Feeling the after effects of weekend drug use can be just as problematic as being intoxicated on the job. Headaches, blurred vision, irritability, difficulty concentrating and extreme tiredness can all create organisational problems,' he said.

Phillip Collins from the ADF said alcohol and drugs effect a person's concentration, coordination and decision making ability at work, as well as causing headaches, blurred vision, irritability and extreme tiredness

'Drugs and alcohol cost Australian businesses $6 billion a year in lost productivity and absenteeism alone.

'Then there's the serious health and safety risks in the workplace, particularly where employees operate machinery or drive vehicles.'

However Mr Collins warned that measures such as drug testing employees, other than those in transport or heavy machinery, should not be adopted without caution.

'Drug testing isn't the only solution, and simply will not work when delivered in isolation. All businesses need a formal workplace policy in conjunction with education, training and support programs.'
