Keeping tabs: Scientology leader David Miscvage reportedly feared his former rival

Two private investigators claim David Miscavige, the leader of the Church of Scientology, paid them $12million over the course of 24 years to spy on his former rival, along with other enemies. 

The top-secret program gave Paul Marrick and Greg Arnold about $500,000 a year and sent them across the world in pursuit of Pat Broeker, who was briefly head of the church before being forced out, the men say.

They are now suing the church after the paychecks stopped rolling in.

The men claim the church violated a longstanding verbal contract to keep them employed for life.

Mr Marrick and Mr Arnold say they did not confine their spying to the ousted former leader - they also spent time watching Mitch Daniels, a young executive of drug company Eli Lilly who went on to become Governor of Indiana and is a possible contender for the presidency in 2016 or 2020, according to the Dallas Morning News.

Eli Lilly was the sole manufacturer of anti-depressant Prozac at the time, and the church is a vocal opponent of modern psychiatric drugs.

They also spied on Marty Rathbun, one of Mr Miscavige's top lieutenants who left the church in 2004 and became an outspoken critic, and a former church spokesman who left in 2007. Both men became strong opponents of Mr Miscavige's leadership.

The church claims it has never hiredthe investigators, and that they were working for attorneys. A spokesman said Mr 
Miscavige had no knowledge of the work that the men did. 

The Church did not immediately respond to a request for comment from MailOnline.

were both reportedly spied on by the two private investigators

The Church of Scientology was founded in
the 1950s by American science fiction author L Ron Hubbard. When he 
died in 1986, a power struggle broke out between Mr Broeker and Mr Miscavige.

Mr Broeker produced a letter from 
Hubbard saying he and his wife were meant to take over the church, but Mr Miscavige claimed it was a forgery.

When Mr Miscavige finally
won out and became leader, Mr Broeker was forced to leave the church.

In
their lawsuit Mr Marrick and Mr Arnold claim the newly-minted leader of
the Scientology church, which boasts A-list celebrity members like Tom 
Cruise and John Travolta, still thought Mr Broeker was a threat. 

So he hired the two to watch him, follow him and dig through his trash.

They even monitored his phone calls for a short time after they were able to give him a bugged phone as a gift.

The lawsuit says the practice was legal at the time.

During their pursuit of Mr Broeker, the men say they followed him around the world, photographing him and filming him as he went.

Mr Rathbun says he personally hired the men for Mr Miscavige when he was still a trusted aide.

'I hired these guys 24 years ago. There were only four of us who knew about it. Me, Miscavige, and those two,' he told the Morning News.

Mr Marrick and Mr Arnold said they reported to Mr Miscavige's underlings for nearly two and a half decades and were paid in cash every year.
