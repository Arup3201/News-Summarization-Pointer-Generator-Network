Wages will increase by more than three per cent next year, the Bank of England predicted yesterday as official figures revealed that Britain’s cost-of-living crisis could finally be coming to an end.

The data shows that average pay – excluding bonuses – is 1.3 per cent higher than a year ago, above the 1.2 per cent rate of inflation.

It means millions of workers are finally receiving ‘real’ wage increases, easing an unprecedented squeeze on family finances triggered by the economic crisis. 

Pay has risen faster than inflation for the first time in five years, meaning families could start to feel better off

Workers in the private sector, especially manufacturing, saw the biggest rises in pay, the ONS said

Bank Governor Mark Carney said it was ‘more likely than not’ that inflation will also dip below one per cent over the next six months as energy and food prices continue to fall.

‘We are seeing encouraging signs,’ Mr Carney said at the launch of the Bank’s quarterly inflation report. ‘We are seeing the start of real pay growth.’

He added: ‘We expect this pick-up to accelerate, with earnings growing a little above three per cent and inflation running around one per cent or 1.5 per cent.

‘It is a welcome development but one swallow doesn’t make a summer. This has to persist.’

The Government seized upon the figures, released by the Office for National Statistics, as ‘remarkable’ and said more generous pay rises would continue into the New Year.

Meanwhile, new data showed employment was at another record high in the three months to September, with 30.8million UK adults now in work. 

It means three-quarters of people aged 16-64 are in employment. 

According to the ONS, 98 per cent of people who have found work in the past three months have gone into full-time jobs, debunking claims by unions and Labour that Britain is in the midst of a ‘part-time recovery’. 

The employment rate has hit 73 per cent, within touching distance of the record 73.2 per cent seen in 2005

On average people in the UK worked a total of 987,854,908 each week in September, the data reveals

The total number of people in work has risen by 2.3 per cent in the last year.

But the biggest rises were among workers from the European Union.

The number of UK-born workers in a job rose by 1.6 per cent, but for people from the other 27 member states, the figure rose by 11.1 per cent.

The biggest rise was among people from Romania and Bulgaira, up 34.9 per cent in a year.

It follows the lifting of work restrictions for people from the two countries in January this year.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: ‘We constantly get this jibe that somehow this is not about full-time work – oh yes it is.

‘Full-time work is absolutely the key to this.’ He said full-time work was ‘important’ to people because it gave them ‘that sense of security’ and ‘that sense of self-worth’, adding that the latest figures were ‘somewhat better than encouraging – they are rather remarkable’.

Unemployment has dropped by 115,000 to 1.96million, the lowest figure since the start of the year.

Chancellor George Osborne said the figures showed the Government’s ‘long-term economic plan is working.’

The Government said a new person had entered the workforce every minute of every working day since the Coalition came to power in 2010.

Economists expressed hope last night that wages would continue to rise during 2015, comfortably beating inflation.

They said households would feel the benefit of even moderate pay rises at a time when shop prices were still falling. 

The total number of people in work rose by 2.3 per cent year-on-year, but surged by  34.9 per cent among people born in Romania and Bulgaria

The figures are a boost for Chancellor George Osborne who will hope to create a 'feel-good factor' in the run-up to the general election in May next year

The price of oil per barrel has plummeted by about a fifth in the past year. And Britain’s biggest supermarkets have slashed their prices to fend off stiff competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl, easing the pressure on family finances.

Richard Troue, of Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, said: ‘Energy and food prices have been falling recently, so even modest wage growth could ease the pressure on consumers and households further, putting more pounds in their pocket in the run-up to Christmas.’

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said yesterday’s figures were ‘not yet much to celebrate’.

He said: ‘I hope the Governor of the Bank of England is right when he says that he thinks that wages will start to grow more strongly than inflation next year, because of course that’s not happened so far.’
