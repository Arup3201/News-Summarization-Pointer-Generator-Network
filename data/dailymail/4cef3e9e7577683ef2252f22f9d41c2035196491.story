A childhood friend of embattled New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has been dragged into the Bridgegate scandal, with emails revealing he gave a key Port Authority official a tour of the traffic chaos.

In the latest twist, emails show Port Authority police officer Thomas 'Chip' Michaels was on the George Washington Bridge with David Wildstein, the official who ordered the road closures, when the disaster unfolded. 

The messages also reveal Michaels was aware of the plan to flood Fort Lee with traffic the
day before the controversial lane closings in September last year and kept Wildstein updated.

It is not clear if Michaels will be implicated in the scandal.

Michaels grew up with Christie in Livingston and even coached the Governor's son in Little League hockey. 

He joined the Port Authority Police Department in 1998, according to payroll records.

The troubling emails were today released by MSNBC's Steve Kornacki and can be found at the bottom of this page.

On September 8, a day before the lane closures, Michaels emailed
Port Authority Captain Darcy Licorish, asking, 'Is there going to be a new
traffic pattern installed for Monday the 9th?'

In a 7.28am email on the first day of the traffic snarl, Wildstein informed Robert Durando, general manager of the bridge, 'Going to take a ride with chip and see how it looks.'

'Want me to pik u up. Its fkd up here (sic),' Michaels, a 15-year Port Authority officer, told Wildstein in a text before the tour.

Michaels later texted Wildstein, 'I may have idea to mak ths beter (sic)'.

The text-message exchanges between 
Michaels and Wildstein were included in documents subpoenaed by a New 
Jersey legislative committee investigating the bridge scandal.

The Fort Lee lane closure scandal has thrown Christie's presidential campaign into disarray, with mounting evidence showing his appointees conspired to 
create traffic jams in Fort Lee, New Jersey on September 9 last year.

The problems began after two toll lanes at a New 
York-bound, toll plaza entrance to the George Washington 
Bridge were closed to traffic from
 Fort Lee before rush hour.

The closures caused massive traffic snarls for days.

Various reasons for the closure have been reported, including that it was political retribution against Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich, a Democrat, for not endorsing Christie in the 2013 gubernatorial election.

Christie has repeatedly denied knowing of the bridge debacle until it was over.

But Wildstein's
 lawyer has recently claim that 'evidence exists' Christie knew of the 
lane closures while they were occurring. Wildstein resigned in December.

Meanwhile, Michaels' brother, Jeffrey Michaels, is a top Republican lobbyist whose business Optimus Partners L.L.C. has flourished under the Christie administration.

MSNBC reported Jeffrey Michaels served as the chief of staff to Republican Gov. Donald DiFrancesco just 
over a decade ago before transitioning into lobbying.

He also advised Christie in his 2009 run for governor.

'I’ve known him for a long time,' Jeffrey Michaels said in a TV interview after the campaign. 'We went to high school with – we – our families knew each other 
from Livingston, and just stayed in close contact with him over the 
years and was very pleased to help his campaign out with policy.'

Local 
reports and I.R.S. filings show Jeffrey Michaels has donated 
extensively to pro-Christie groups.

The donations include $25,000 to a PAC-created 
to push the governor’s agenda and $20,450 since October 2012 to the 
Republican Governors Association, which Christie heads.
