Malia and Sasha Obama got to spend some time with rock and roll royalty on Saturday.

President Obama and his two daughters spent the final day of their Hawaiian vacation relaxing on the beach, visiting the President's half-sister Maya Soetoro-Ng and hanging with Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder.

Vedder, a longtime Obama supporter, has a home on the island with his family.

The President and his daughters spent about 20 minutes with Vedder at his Kailua residence.

Michelle was not with the group for the visit. 

The media did not have access to the visit, so little is known about what the group chatted about.

Vedder supported Obama's 2012 presidential run by performing at a Florida fundraiser.

In prior elections he had been a strong supporter of Green Party contender Ralph Nader, and made his disdain for President Bush very clear during his two terms.

'I’m moving to a different country if little Damien II is elected.' said Vedder of Bush prior to the 200 election.

And while Bush did indeed win, Vedder did not end up making the move.

As for the Obama family, their holiday vacation has come to an end and they will fly back to Washington D.C. later today.
