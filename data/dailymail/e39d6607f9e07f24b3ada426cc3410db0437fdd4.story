A 25-year-old man held by police after the body of his pregnant prostitute wife was found on a dirt bike track has been placed on suicide watch.

Justin Adams, who was arrested for the murder of his wife Jaymie and their unborn child on Friday, told jailors at Oklahoma County prison he had thought about killing himself after she went missing on December 10.

The mother-of-three, who advertised sexual services on Craigslist, had gone to meet a client the night she disappeared, her husband told police.

Arrested: Justin Adams, 25, has been arrested for double-murder after his wife, carrying their unborn child, was murdered. He has been placed on suicide watch

A motorcyclist found her body along a dirt track on January 7, although authorities believe it was just there for a day before it was discovered.

The cars of Adams and his mother, Tina Clark, were later seized by police, who said they were looking for evidence in the vehicles.

Adams had originally told investigators his wife had gone to meet a friend, but two weeks later revealed she had gone to meet a client in a motel.

He admitted he and his wife, who had been married since February, were 'swingers' and that she advertised on Craigslist as a 'massage therapist'.

Adams was arrested on a double murder 
complaint on Friday.

It came after authorities evidence from interviews, phone records, the internet and email accounts that were inconsistent with Adams's story.

Oklahoma law states a suspect can be charged with two murders
if the victim is pregnant.

He told his attorney he was stripped of his clothes and was forced to sleep naked on a steel bunk bed without a mattress in prison, NewsOK reported.

But a sheriff's spokesman told the paper Adams was given a smock to wear and was on suicide watch for his first 48 hours in jail.

He added Adams now is wearing regular
jail clothes and is on mental health observation status, which means he
is checked every 15 minutes.

Police believe he fatally stabbed his wife before dumping her body at a dirt bike track in southeast Oklahoma City, according to NewsOK.

He has not yet been charged.

Judge Russell Hall told him at a video 
arraignment on Monday: 'The district attorney will take a look at the 
police report and type up the charges.'

The judge denied bail.

Adams
was the last person to see his wife alive after she left their trailer 
park home in Blanchard, Oklahoma to meet a 'friend' at a McDonald's.

bike track weeks after she went missing, and police believe it may have been there for a day

Suspicious: Jaymie Adams, 25, told her husband of 11 months she was going to meet a 'friend' at this McDonalds, where police later found her van

He initially told police she had called from the restaurant saying the friend had not shown up but that was the last he heard from her. He denied knowing who she was meeting.

Police seized her truck after Adams called to say he had found it in the McDonald's parking lot.

Justin and Jaymie Adams had been married since February and have a four-month-old child together.

Following her disappearance, Adams made an emotional TV appeal, urging the public to help bring his wife home safely.

Secretive: Adams later revealed his wife had gone to meet a client at a motel

He said: 'She deserves to be at home with her family, our children need their mother.

'My wife is a loving a strong woman. She's an amazing mom, and amazing wife. We have three sons and she's two-months pregnant this week.

'I'm begging that if anyone has any information about my wife or her whereabouts, call police.'
