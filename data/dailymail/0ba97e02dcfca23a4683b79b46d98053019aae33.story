A Spanish electro pop act has been released after a being kidnapped by the notorious Los Zetas cartel in Mexico.

Delorean, a Barcelona-based four-piece, were held hostage in a Mexico City hotel for 30 hours by the drug lords, who demanded nearly a quarter of a million pounds for their lives.

Fortunately, local police were able to track the Zetas, famous for gruesome torture methods and mass murders, and band members have been able to return to Spain.

Kidnapped: Spanish electro pop band Delorean were taken by Los Zetas - one of Mexico's most dangerous drug cartels - after playing at a music festival

Delorean had returned to their Mexico city hotel following a performance at a festival when they were lured into a hostage situation through a fake phone call from the Zetas cartel.

They were told they had to vacate the premises due to a shootout, but they were taken by cartel members as soon as they complied.

Ekhi Lopetegi, Guillermo Astrain, Unai Lazcano, and Igor Escudeo, originally from the Basque country, were taken to a different hotel and locked in two separate rooms, El Pais reports.

The Zetas then contacted their family member s demanding a ransom of five million Mexican peso – approximately £240,000 – for their safe return.

Thanks to various police forces including Interpol, the source of the phone calls made to the band’s hotel could be tracked and after 30 hours in captivity the four men could be released.

Official statement: Delorean posted their version of events on their Facebook page

On Wednesday the band posted their version of the events on their official Facebook page:

Los Zetas is one of the most dangerous and powerful crime syndicates in Mexico.

The cartel is known for committing some of the most brutal crimes in Latin America as part of their on-going turf war with rival cartels.

Los Zetas was set up by a group of defectors from the Mexican Special Forces in the early 1990s and grew into one of the most powerful and brutal groups in the area within its first two decades.

After splitting from the Gulf Cartel in 2010, the cartel embarked on one of the most violent turf wars in modern Latin American history, turning Mexico into a battle ground.

As well as smuggle drugs, control local crime syndicates, bribe and kidnap, Los Zetas use fear, torture and mass murder to stay in power.

The group is responsible for several of Mexico's bloodiest massacres in the 10s including the San Fernando Massacres of 2010 and 2011 where 72 and 193 people respectively, were found tortured and brutally murdered.

Los Zetas has been branded the ‘most technologically advanced, sophisticated, and dangerous cartel operating in Mexico’ by the US Government.

‘On Monday morning October 7th we received a phone call at our hotel room in Mexico City from a person posing as a hotel security officer. We were informed that there was a security threat at the hotel.

‘What followed for the next 30 hours was an experience where the threat of death was real due to the psychological manipulation inflicted on us by our kidnappers.

'Thanks to the fantastic work of the National Police in Spain, Ertzantza, Interpol and the Federal Police in Mexico, we were successfully rescued yesterday morning.

‘While it would be convenient to blame
Mexico, that would not be sound. This could have occurred anywhere in 
the world.

'Our hope is that this situation will bring attention to the 
abuse that we were subjected to by our kidnappers, so that other 
travelers do not fall victim in the future.

'This
has been extremely difficult for us and our families.

'At this time we 
have no further comment and we ask that you respect our privacy so that 
we can return to normality in our lives.’

With
their 2010 debut album hailed by reviewers on New York Times and 
Pitchfork, the band had been preparing a world tour to promote their new
album Apar, when they were kidnapped.

The band's last tweet on Wednesday linked to a statement from their record label True Panther Sounds asking for privacy.

Fear-mongering: Los Zetas shot dead five people in Apodaca in 2010, before pinning a message to their chest with an ice pick as a warning to collaborators of a rival drug cartel

Gruesome drug war: In September 2011 two trucks were abandoned after one of them spilled 35 bodies of men and women belonging to the Los Zetas gang killed by a rival cartel. Morales and his henchmen set out to exact bitter revenge for the slaughter
