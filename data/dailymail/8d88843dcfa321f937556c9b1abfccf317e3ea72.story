A woman driver who was stopped for not wearing a seat belt escaped a £500 fine after telling police it hurts her breasts.

Officers from the Lincolnshire Road Policing Unit spotted the female motorist driving in Grantham, Lincolnshire, and pulled her over yesterday afternoon.

When asked why she had her seat belt tucked under arm, the lady simply replied: 'Because it hurts my boobs'.

Let off: The driver stopped in Grantham bluntly told officers her seat belt 'hurts my boobs' (file picture)

The excuse worked - and officers sent her on her way with just a warning.

Instead she 'received advice' from police who explained what she was doing was illegal and could cause more serious injury.

Taking to their @LincsRPU Twitter account yesterday afternoon Lincolnshire Road Policing Unite said: 'Female driver stopped in Grantham wearing her seat belt under arm.

'Advice given, she replied “it hurts my boobs” I’ve heard it all now.

'It is classed as not wearing a seat belt if not worn correctly. Also it could cause more injury. #Fatal4'

One of the unit’s 9,448 followers @MillieLogica replied: 'they really do sometimes. But then, I suspect going through a windscreen hurts more.'

Another Twitter user Beth Quinton added: 'I thought this sort of thing only worked in the movies. Fair play to her, the officers must have fell for her charms.

'To be honest us girls would all try that if we were in a similar position.'
