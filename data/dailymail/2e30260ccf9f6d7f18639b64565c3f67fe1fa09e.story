On a mission: David Cameron (pictured today) announced the Help to Buy Scheme will be launched next week

Ambitious plans to offer 200,000 people access to cheaper mortgages are to be rushed forward, David Cameron revealed today.

The Prime Minister announced the Help To Buy scheme, which provides 95 per cent mortgages part-guaranteed by the Government, will start from next week – three months ahead of schedule.

Thousands of people will get the chance to purchase a house worth up to £600,000 with a deposit of just five per cent.

The Government will underwrite an additional 15 per cent of the loan to make the deal attractive to lenders. The £12billion initiative will last for three years.

Mr Cameron believes bringing forward the scheme is vital to helping speed up economic recovery.

A defiant PM insisted he would not 'stand back’ while people could not afford to get on the housing ladder.

He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘The Bank of England (said) expressly, there isn’t a bubble. The housing market is recovering, but from a low base.

‘If you look at prices outside London and the South East, they’re only going up by 0.8 per cent. Talk of a housing bubble to people here in Manchester or Salford and they will literally laugh in your face.

‘As Prime Minister, I’m not going to stand back while people’s aspirations to get on the housing ladder, to own their own flat, to own their own home, are being trashed.

‘That’s why we need to act, and that’s why it’s good news that we’re bringing forward the Help to Buy scheme, and I can tell you today that NatWest, RBS, Halifax, are all going to be putting forward these products.’He dismissed claims that the scheme 
would cause a housing bubble, and said the Bank of England had been 
given the tools to ‘report on these things and stop bubbles from 
occurring’.

Cameron said he brought forward the plan - which was due to begin in three months time - to help hard working Britons struggling to get a mortgage

David Cameron would block a mansion tax after the next election, even if he was forced into another coalition.

The Liberal Democrat's have long argued for a levy on multi-million pound homes, with Labour also backing the idea.

But Mr Cameron made clear that for as long as the Tories are in power he will block the plan.

But he suggested council tax and stamp duty could be used to raise more money.

He told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: 'I don't think this is a good idea.

'I want to live in a country where people work hard, they save and they put money into their homes.

'I think it's right people pay council tax, it's right people pay stamp duty - and we put that up - but to go after someone's house every year with a wealth tax, I don't think that's a sensible thing to do.

'I have never been in favour of this idea. I think it's a bad idea.'

Asked if voters could be sure that there would be no mansion tax if he was Prime Minister after the next election, Mr Cameron added:

'That's correct. Stamp duty yes, council tax yes, but I think wealth taxes are not sensible for a country if it wants to support wealth creation, wants to reward saving and people who work hard and do the right thing.'

Mr Cameron also
 told the Sunday Telegraph that a housing market which requires young 
professionals to come up with a deposit of a £40,000 or £50,000 is 
‘broken’.

He said: ‘If you haven’t got rich parents you can’t get that sort of money.

'So
 that scheme comes forward, starting next week. That is a major move in 
terms of backing aspiration and home ownership which is something very 
close to my heart.’

A number of high profile figures have warned that it could lead to more problems than it solves.

Liberal
 Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable warned the scheme 'could 
inflate the market' and said he feared there was a 'danger of getting 
into another housing bubble'.

Former
 Bank of England governor Lord King warned that the scheme is 'too close
 for comfort' to a general scheme to guarantee mortgages.

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: 'If 
David Cameron is serious about helping first time buyers he should be 
bringing forward investment to build more affordable homes.

'Rising 
demand for housing must be matched with rising supply, but under this 
government housebuilding is at its lowest level since the 1920s.

'Unless
 David Cameron acts now to build more affordable homes, as Labour has 
urged, then soaring prices risk making it even harder for first time 
buyers to get on the housing ladder.

'The Bank of England
 should immediately review the details of the scheme now before they are
 set in stone.'

Mr 
Cameron dismissed concerns, telling The Sun people outside the M25 
'laugh, quite rightly, in your face' at the suggestion there is a 
housing boom.

He said: 'Look at the number of first time buyers - it is still almost half what it was before the difficulties that we faced.

'The number of mortgage approvals is still way below where it was.'

'Don't take it from me, take it from the Bank of England who looked at this last week and said there isn't one.'

Concerns: Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable warned the scheme 'could inflate the market' and said he feared there was a 'danger of getting into another housing bubble'

Meanwhile, Mr Cameron denied claims he was 'chasing off to the right' with certain policies and was 'very firmly anchored where I have always been'.

'Yes, I want to win back voters from Ukip,' he told the Sunday Telegraph.

'But let me be clear, I am also a Prime Minister who is a modern compassionate Conservative who believes that there is a very important role for government in making sure that we look after the poorest in our society, that we are a compassionate society, that we give people opportunities who aren't necessarily born with them. We are not going to abandon that.'

Mr Cameron may find himself debunking other claims in the following days as further revelations about those at the heart of government were revealed yesterday in new book In It Together by Matthew d'Ancona.

Mr Cameron, pictured today with his wife Samantha at a cancer ward at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, said he was desperate to win back voters from Ukip, but was unwilling to waiver further right to do so

The book claims that the PM expressed
 private regret over pushing ahead with gay marriage reforms in the face
 of fierce opposition from many of his backbenchers.

Clashes
 between George Osborne and Iain Duncan Smith reportedly led to the 
Chancellor claiming the Work and Pensions Secretary is 'not clever 
enough'.

'I am impatient to help young people get on the housing ladder. The need is now. I have always wanted this to come in and frankly the earlier the better'

Prime Minister David Cameron

Mr Duncan Smith, however, found Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne being in office comparable to 'Ant and Dec' running the country, according to a friend.

The series of revelations comes just days before the Conservative conference, held this year in Manchester.

Going in to the conference, the party is suffering from a slight dip in the polls - it was revealed yesterday.

The YouGov poll for The Sunday Times puts Labour on 42 per cent, the Tories on 31 per cent, Ukip on 13 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on nine per cent.
