Manuel Neuer made a horrendous error as Bayern Munich were stunned by a 2-0 defeat at home Borussia Monchengladbach in the Bundesliga on Sunday.

Raffael  scored both goals for Monchengladbach but his first, in the 30th minute, was fortuitous.

His strike from the edge of the area was straight at Neuer but the usually efficient goalkeeper had sidestepped too far to his right and fumbled the ball over the line, unable to get his body behind the ball.

And Neuer could have done better with Raffael's  second on 77, with the attacker's low shot going in under the dive of the Germany international.

The result meant Monchengladbach handed Pep Guardiola's  side only their second league defeat of the season. 

The win keeps Gladbach firmly in third place on 47 points with Bayern 10 points clear at the top after second-placed Wolfsburg's 1-1 draw at Mainz 05.

With more than 80 percent possession in the opening 20 minutes, it was clear from the start that Bayern wanted an early goal with Arjen Robben and Robert Lewandowski coming close.

But Dutch forward Robben's comeback from injury was cut short when he had to come off in the 24th and the visitors then scored with their first shot on goal.

Neuer failed to hold on to Raffael's shot, with the ball rolling through his hands and over the line.

Gladbach grew bolder in the second half and Neuer had to pull off a fine save to deny forward Andre Hahn in the 70th.

The Germany keeper was, however, again beaten when Raffael picked up a Christoph Kramer pass after a superb run and slotted home for a surprise victory over the champions.
