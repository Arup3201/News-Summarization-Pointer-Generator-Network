It may be the fastest animal to run on the Earth, but the cheetah could be racing to extinction.

Scientists think the animals' speed has left them ill-equipped to deal with their modern environment.

There are fewer than 10,000 cheetahs left in the wild - down from 100,000 a century ago.

It may be the fastest animal to run on the Earth, but the cheetah could be racing to extinction. Scientists think the animals' speed has left them ill-equipped to deal with their modern environment

And the way they are built for speed - with a slimline build and low body mass - has left it less able to store energy when it is not sprinting. 

Before humans built across the African savannah where cheetahs hunt, this was not a problem.

In times of plenty, the animals could rely on their 75mph speed to catch plenty of prey.

But in the modern age, with their shrinking habitat squeezed on all sides by buildings and farmland, there is far greater competition for food from larger and stronger predators such as lions, leopards and hyeenas.

Academics at Queen's University Belfast found that they spend much of their time and energy slowly stalking the savannah in search of food - an activity they are not evolved for.

While they are built for sharp bursts of speed, their lightweight frame means they cannot store energy for long treks.

Lead researcher Dr Michael Scantlebury, whose paper is published in the journal Science, said: 'Cheetahs may be Ferraris but most of the time they are driving slowly.

Wildlife populations around the world have more than halved in just four decades in the face of unsustainable human consumption, a report has warned.

Mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish have declined on average by 52 per cent from 1970 to 2010, according to WWF's Living Planet Report, which uses information on 10,380 populations of 3,038 species to see how global wildlife is faring.

Experts from the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), which maintains the database of information on the species, said the figures meant that where in 1970 there was a population of 100 animals, now there were only 50.

For freshwater creatures, the situation is even worse, with population declines of more than three-quarters (76 per cent) in 40 years, the 'living planet index' of species shows. 

'What our study showed was that their major energy costs seem to be incurred by travelling, rather than securing prey.

'If you can imagine walking up and down sand dunes in high temperatures day in, day out, with no water to drink you start to get a feel for how challenging these cats' daily lives are.'

'The reality may be that human activities – for example erecting fences that inhibit free travel or over-hunting cheetah prey – are forcing cheetahs to travel ever-increasing distances and that this may be compromising their energy more than any other single factor.'

The team studied 19 free-roaming cheetahs each for two weeks across two sites in southern Africa, injecting them with a traceable substance and then collecting their droppings.

Analysis of the waste showed how much of the substance they were losing each day, allowing the scientists to calculate their energy expenditure.

Co-author Dr Nikki Marks, also from Queen's University Belfast said: 'Research of this type helps improve our understanding of the challenges facing cheetahs as they strive to survive and helps inform future decisions on conservation strategies for cheetahs and other threatened animals.'

Dr John Wilson, of North Carolina State University in the US, who also worked on the resaerch, added: 'Too often we blame lions and hyenas for decimating cheetah populations when in fact, it is likely to be us humans that drive their declines.

'Imagine how hard it must be for a small cub to follow its mother further and further through the desert to look for food, while she herself is fighting for survival.'

This is largely due to the loss of habitat across the African savannah
