A white tent next to a bowling green at the Belvidere Bowling Club near Celtic Park, with police snipers bearing down from the rooftops of neighbouring high-rise flats, was not perhaps the most fitting welcome to Glasgow for a knight of the realm. But it didn’t seem to bother Sir Bradley Wiggins.

‘No-one calls me that anyway,’ he said. ‘No-one. Only Sir Dave.’

He meant Sir David Brailsford, the former director of British Cycling and now principal of Team Sky: also known as the man who left Wiggins out of Sky’s team for this year’s Tour de France. No wonder Wiggins’ voice was dripping with sarcasm.

Representing: Sir Bradley Wiggins will be riding for England at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow

In practice: Wiggins during a training session at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome in Glasgow

‘F***ing Chris Froome,’ was his opening gambit, delivered strictly tongue-in-cheek and with a cheeky smile as he took off his rockstar sunglasses to speak to the assembled press. He was bang on time, interesting and engaging.

Most unlike your average sportsman, in fact. We had, however, already been politely told that all Tour de France questions were strictly off the menu. Wiggins is here in Glasgow to concentrate on other things, after all.

His primary focus has now switched back to the track: first the 4,000 metres of the team pursuit on Thursday, the only event he will contest in Glasgow, and then his attempt to win his fifth Olympic gold medal in Rio de Janeiro in two years’ time.

Another Olympic title would take his overall medal tally to eight; one ahead of Sir Chris Hoy, who won six golds and a silver medal during his career.

The 34-year-old had plenty to say about his fellow cycling knight, mind you; primarily about the arena which bears Sir Chris’ name and in which Wiggins will race this week.

‘It is a bit odd,’ he said. ‘I’d be a bit p***** off if I were him because they’ve stuck a great big Emirates sign over his name and it doesn’t stand out that it’s the Sir Chris Hoy velodrome other than a little thing as you walk in. It’s more like a shopping sign with an Emirates thing on it.

‘I think there should be more made for him. Stick a whopping great statue outside because it doesn’t hit you straight away that it’s his velodrome. I think he got done over a bit.

‘But he won’t complain because he’s far too nice. So I’ll complain for him. They should do something about it.’

Sir Brad had spoken, but there was little of the stoic elder statesman about an athlete who seemed to have rediscovered his love for the track he left six years ago to concentrate on road racing.

He spoke of feeling refreshed and excited to be back in an environment that began when he won the three-kilometre individual pursuit at the world junior championship in 1998 and then silver in the team pursuit at the Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpar later that year.

He said: ‘Especially having not been selected for the Tour, the track was kind of like the perfect distraction.

‘The road’s so different. It’s not enjoyable the road, in some ways. You go there and there’s so much pressure on you because of who you are within road cycling.

‘Everyone’s watching you all the time, whereas you can go into the track and have off days and no-one really sees.

‘I remember finding out I wasn’t doing the Tour. Then it was like: “Monday morning I was hitting the track.” It was like going back 15 years: the excitement of building my bike up again and getting back on the track for the first time. It was really refreshing actually, just enjoyable.

‘I felt back in with the boys and they didn’t really care who you were. It was kind of like I had been away for the school holidays and come back to a new year and there new kids starting and everything.

‘I’m a lot stronger than I used to be in the event, which is one of the things the road has given me. Hopefully that will continue for the next two years.’

More success: Wiggins is hoping to add to his previous Olympic triumphs, with gold at London 2012 one of his seven medals

Glasgow may only be a stepping stone in Wiggins’ bid to become the most decorated British Olympian in history, but this competition clearly means something to him.

He has won three silver medals but never a gold, and was enthused yesteday about the competitiveness of the track cycling. England will face tough opposition from Australia and New Zealand in particular.

‘The Commonwealth Games is a fantastic event in its own right,’ said Wiggins. ‘Going up against Australia or New Zealand, it could be an Olympic final or world final.

‘Being part of it all at 18 in Kuala Lumpar was like being at the Olympics. I was in the Village with the likes of Steve Backley, Iwan Thomas and all those types of people.

‘At the time it was massive. I guess that was the warm-up to the Olympics two years later and that inspired me to move on.’

The famous sideburns may have gone, so too the yellow jersey, but Wiggins’ star quality remains.
