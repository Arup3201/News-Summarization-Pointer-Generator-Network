An Ex-University of Delaware doctorate student from Mexico was arrested after being accused of hiding cameras in women's restrooms on campus.

The suspect, identified as Javier Mendiola-Soto, 38, was charged with 21 counts of criminal violation.

Mendiola-Soto's alleged lechery came to light after a woman found a tiny camera hidden inside a tampon dispenser in early July, reported FOX.

Suspected Peeping Tom: 38-year-old Javier Mendiola-Soto of Mexico has been arrested and charged with 21 counts of criminal violation of privacy for allegedly filming girl in campus bathrooms

Police say they confiscated 1,500 video files of women using the restroom from Mendiola-Soto.

Authorities found recordings from bathrooms in five different buildings, including the Delaware Biotechnology Institute where he was a former employee.

Students at the University of Delaware learned about the suspect's X-rated peeping and about the arrest on Friday.

'It’s pretty disturbing knowing that he did it in more than one bathroom and you have to take the time to actually plan all that stuff out is just really scary,' UD Senior Joe Borowski said.

'That's gross. Why would you even want to see someone using the bathroom? That's weird,' said senior Phoebe Connell.

Mendiola-Soto has had his visa revoked and is being held at Howard Young Correctional facility in Wilmington, Delaware without bail.

'It is extremely disturbing that this crime was perpetrated against our community invading the privacy of so many women on and around this campus,' said University of Delaware President Patrick Harker

'We are taking this matter extremely seriously, cooperating with the Delaware Attorney General’s office and conducting this investigation with urgency and a deep respect for the privacy of the victims, in coordination with the Middletown Police forensics team,' he continued.

The University is offering counselling for students and employees whose privacy was violated, reported the New York Daily News.

Police say that there are hundreds of victims and they hope that some of them will testify.

Campus security is already planning measures to ensure that a privacy breach such as this one does not happen again.

'It’s very discouraging. This was a really serious crime, not just for the victims and we have several, several victims, but for the University of Delaware community as a whole. You somewhat feel violated that somebody would do something heinous like this,' said the executive director of public and campus safety Skip Homiak.

When the 23,000 students return to school in the fall they will need to endure random security checks including checks of all restrooms.
