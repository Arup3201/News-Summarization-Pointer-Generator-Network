A wave of strike action billed as the biggest co-ordinated walkout in 90 years by public sector unions was yesterday branded a damp squib.

Official estimates put overall turnout at less than half a million, well below the number claimed by unions. 

In the Civil Service, the Cabinet Office said just 18 per cent of staff had taken part – the smallest number ever to join a national strike.

The Local Government Association estimated 95 per cent of local council staff to be in work, and fire services in England were operational thanks to contingency planning. There were also no unplanned closures in the courts, and all 717 Jobcentres in the country opened as usual.

Some unions last balloted on strikes years ago, but despite the threat of a legal clampdown if the Tories win the next election, union leaders threatened a fresh wave of strikes in the autumn and next year without any new ballot of members.

But the one-day action over pay and pensions was sufficient to close 21 per cent of schools, leaving thousands of parents having to take time off work or arrange emergency childcare. In some areas, almost all schools were affected, while in others – mainly shire counties – the walkout forced barely any closures.

Yesterday Downing Street said David Cameron did not believe ‘illegitimate’ walkouts causing disruption across vital public services can ever be justified, signalling that the Tories are examining tough new anti-strike laws.

His official spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister’s view is that he doesn’t think it’s right that public services should be disrupted. He doesn’t believe people should face disruption, be it commuters or parents with children.’

Senior Conservatives are understood to be considering restricting the right to strike across professions where interruptions to services can endanger life, health or the ‘normal living conditions’ of the public.

Soldiers and policemen, for similar reasons, are already barred from walking out. Such a move – on top of proposals for higher voting thresholds before strike action can be law and an end to ‘never-ending’ mandates for action that union leaders roll on indefinitely – would be highly controversial.

Yesterday some London boroughs saw the majority of schools close or partially close, including Barking and Dagenham, with 90 per cent affected, and Tower Hamlets with 87 per cent.

In Manchester, 126 out of 177 schools were fully or partly closed, while in Knowsley, Merseyside, 57 out of 60 schools were affected.

Museums shut their doors in Edinburgh, Nottingham and Leicester, some libraries were closed, and bin collections were halted in Derby.

The Treasury estimated that the disruption cost the economy as much as £250million.

Alongside the NUT, members of the Fire Brigades Union, the GMB, the Public and Commercial Services Union, Unison and Unite all took action.

In the Commons, Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude, who is in charge of the Government’s response to the strikes, questioned their legitimacy – saying they had been organised with the backing of tiny proportions of overall union memberships.

He also pointed out that some of the ballots used to justify action were months or years out of date – with the National Union of Teachers relying on a vote in 2012.

Mr Maude said the more often unions went on strike, the ‘stronger the case’ for a change in the law being included in the Conservatives’ general election manifesto next year. Labour, which has received £23.6million in donations from unions involved in yesterday’s strikes, refused to condemn them.

Leader Ed Miliband said: ‘Nobody wants to see these strikes because of the disruption that is being caused for parents and others. Strikes are always a sign of failure on all sides but the key now is to prevent further strikes and further disruption happening. The answer is to get round the table and prevent further strikes happening.’

TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘Today’s well- supported action shows just how angry public servants are at plans to lock them out of sharing in the recovery until at least 2018.

‘Nearly half a million local government workers are paid less than the living wage – it is time that they shared in the growth that ministers trumpet. But rather than get round the table, ministers are threatening a change in the law that would make legal strikes close to impossible.’

Conservative MP Dominic Raab said the ‘real aim’ of the strikes was ‘to challenge the will of an elected government to deliver its policies – from deficit reduction to schools reform’. He added: ‘There should be a ban on strikes without the backing of a majority of union members. It’s hardly right-wing: the public back this proposal by three to one.’

Huw Jones, a Labour parliamentary candidate, caused anger after retweeting a message that compared David Cameron to Adolf Hitler. The message said: ‘1933, Hitler bans trade unions in Nazi Germany. 2014, Tory restrictions on public sector workers’ ability to strike.’Tory MP Henry Smith said the comparison was ‘absolutely disgusting’ and called for the candidate to be sacked.
