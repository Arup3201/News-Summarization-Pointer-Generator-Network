From her big blonde bouffant hair to her statement bright lips, Dolly Parton has perfected her signature look throughout her years in the spotlight.

And while she's now one of the most successful female country artists of all time with an estimated 177 million in album sales, she didn't always have access to the best beauty products when she was growing up in Tennessee.

In her new memoir entitled, Dream More, the 66-year-old country crooner shares the unusual beauty tricks of her past.

Dolly Parton has admitted the secrets to perfecting her signature look as a teenager in her new memoir

She said: 'Until I was a teenager, I used red pokeberries for lipstick and a burnt matchstick for eyeliner. I used honeysuckle for perfume.

'We were raised in the Pentecostal Church of God and they believed that wearing makeup was sinful.

'My Grandpa Jake, my Mamaâ€™s dad, was a preacher. So I had to sneak around and make myself look all pretty but then wash it off before they caught me.'

Things weren't always as glamorous for the successful country singer, who used to have to scrub her make-up off so her family wouldn't see her wearing it

The largely unfamiliar pokeberry originates from a genus of plants known as Phytolacca native to North America, South America, East Asia and New Zealand.

They are actually poisonous if not cooked properly but fearless Dolly loved the deep red look on her lips, as they say: beauty is pain.
