A father who jumped from his car to direct traffic around the scene of a horrific accident was left devastated after being told that his own son was critically injured in one of the blazing vehicles.

Glen Davis was helping to usher traffic past the accident site when his partner rushed to tell him that his 19-year-old son Kyle was inside one of the vehicles.

The car the 19-year-old was a passenger inside had split in two and was on fire.

Mr Davis was told the dreadful news by his partner.

‘She recognised the car and ran to tell him the terrible news,’ a witness said.

The
car’s driver, Kyle’s 19-year-old pregnant girlfriend Kimberley Conna, 
was killed instantly when the vehicle hit an electricity pole.

Kyle
was rescued from the burning vehicle but he had sustained such severe 
head injuries that he was fighting for his life in Sydney’s Westmead 
Hospital today.

A relative told Sydney’s Daily Telegraph the teenager was not expected to survive.

Police
said they believed the car Kyle and his girlfriend were travelling in 
was drag racing another vehicle along Luxford road in the western Sydney
suburb of Lethbridge Park.

The driver of the other car suffered a smashed jaw, said ambulance officials.

‘We’re
investigating witness reports that the vehicles were involved in racing
one another moments before the accident,’ said a police officer.

‘A collision with an impact like that would suggest speed was a factor, but that is something that will be investigated,’ he told the paper.

Witnesses have told police that the cars appeared to be travelling at speeds in excess of 110mph.

George Hanna, 27, who lives near the scene of the crash site, helped drag one of the victims from a car before the vehicle went up in flames – while nearby Mr Davis was helping direct traffic, unaware that his son was involved in the crash.

Referring to the driver with the broken jaw, Mr Hanna said: ‘I rushed out and got the driver out of the white car, who was semi-conscious, and dragged him to the other side of the road. About five seconds later the car went up in flames.’

He said it was the third time cars had crashed into the power pole in six months.

Friends of Miss Conna, who was six months pregnant, turned to Facebook today to pay tribute to ‘such an amazing girl.’

One friend wrote: ‘I can’t believe such a young life has been taken away from this world. Everyone that knew you will miss you dearly babe.’
