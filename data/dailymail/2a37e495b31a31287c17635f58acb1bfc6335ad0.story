 A black woman who had recently moved into a wealthy Washington DC suburb awoke to find 'N**** go home' painted on her garage door, police have said.

The victim, who has not been identified, was reportedly alerted to the racial slur by a neighbor who was walking past her house in Chevy Chase, Montgomery County, on Monday morning.

The pair then worked together to remove the offensive words - scrawled across the door in bright red paint - before dialing 911. Police are now investigating the incident as a hate crime.

Chevy Chase, northwest of America's capital, is one of the most affluent towns in the country. With a median household income of more than $250,000, it is renowned for its stunning Victorian homes.

Speaking to WTOP, Montgomery County Police Captain Paul Starks said the woman had only lived in the neighborhood - home to hundreds of lawyers and government officials - for a matter of days.

'The victim has just moved in a little over a week ago,' he told the news station.

Police believe the racial slur was spray-painted on the woman's house - situated on the 3300 block of Glenmoor Drive - at some point between 2pm on Sunday and 7am on Monday.

In a bid to locate the offender, they released a photo of the victim's garage door via Twitter on Monday afternoon. In the image, the racial word in question is digitally hidden with a large white box.

No other acts of vandalism nor malicious destruction have been reported in the area.

The incident comes as million around the country have been celebrating Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
