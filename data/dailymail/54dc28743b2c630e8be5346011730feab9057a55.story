Facebook is changing its policy on content endorsing rape and violence against women after a social media campaign

Campaign #FBRape, set up by activists, highlighted the flaw in the social network’s guidelines which banned hate speech but not offensive remarks regarding sexual assault.

Following the hugely successful campaign, which saw several companies pull their advertisements from Facebook, the website agreed to change their policies.

In a public statement, Facebook acknowledge its failure to block the offensive content and promised  to train staff to be able to spot such posts in order to make Facebook a' safe and respectful place for sharing and connection'.

‘The guidelines used by these systems have failed to capture all the content that violates our standards.

‘We need to do better — and we will,’ Facebook said in their statement.

Laura Bates, founder of the Everyday Sexism Project, writer and activist Soraya Chemaly and Jaclyn Friedman from Women, Action & the Media joined forces to launch the hashtag Twitter campaign #FBRape last Tuesday.

#FBRape saw companies such as Finnair, Dove and Nissan UK contact Facebook to block their advertisements on the site.

‘I'm so thrilled honestly that they've recognized that they have work to do,’ Friedman told NBC News.’I feel like we're moving to a better place.’

The campaign highlighted that Facebook previously refused to censor content appearing to endorse vilence against women and rape, including insulting pictures and slogans, as well as entire pages and Facebook groups created to promote violence against women.

Examples of anti-women content on the 
site include 'Violently Raping Your Friend Just for Laughs' and 'Fly 
Kicking Sluts in the Uterus' groups as well as images of sleeping young 
women with their trousers pulled down alongside text suggesting they 
have ingested and enjoyed 'roofie' date rape drugs.

'Specifically, we call on you, Facebook, to take three actions,' the campaigners wrote in an open letter.

'Recognize speech that trivializes or 
glorifies violence against girls and women as hate speech and make a 
commitment that you will not tolerate this content.

'Effectively train moderators to recognize and remove gender-based hate speech.

'Effectively train moderators to 
understand how online harassment differently affects women and men, in 
part due to the real-world pandemic of violence against women.'

The group said more than 50,000 tweets
 and more than 4,500 emails had been sent through its site since the 
hashtag was launched last Tuesday.

A petition on Change.org has also attracted more than 222,000 signatures.

Laura, 26, who lives in London, 
founded the Everyday Sexism Project which has collected over 30,000 
women's experiences of gender imbalance over the last year alone.

'I see and hear stories every single 
day from women whose lives are directly impacted by sexism, misogyny and
 sexual abuse,' she told MailOnline.

'So these pictures and pages hit very 
close to home for me. And when I receive emails from teenage girls who 
have been raped, but won't report it because they think they must be to 
blame, or they won't be taken seriously.

'I can't help but think that 
Facebook has a responsibility to stand up to the normalisation of rape 
and domestic violence that is created by these pages condoning and 
depicting it.

'Of course it's not as simple as 
saying that one directly leads to another, but it certainly creates a 
culture in which the message is sent out, loud and clear, that rape and 
domestic violence are something to laugh and boast about, not something 
to take seriously. ‘
