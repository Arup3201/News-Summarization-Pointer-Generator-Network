One is a black soul singer known on this side of the Atlantic for little more than a  one-off hit in the early 1980s.

The other plots the course of the British economy as Chancellor of the Exchequer and, as far as we know, restricts his singing to the shower.

Still, when you are the leader of the free world, it is easy to get mixed up on small details.

Barack Obama repeatedly referred to George Osborne as ‘Jeffrey’ during G8 meetings this week in an embarrassing blow for the Chancellor.

Confused: US President Obama later apologised to the Chancellor for getting in a muddle about his name

Singer: The Chancellor ruled out a duet, with colleagues confirming his talents lie elsewhere

The US President mixed Mr Osborne up 
with his favourite soul singer Jeffrey Osborne, who today offered to 
duet with the top Tory.

But George Osborne responded today on Twitter, writing: ' Jeff you wouldn't suggest a duet if you'd heard me sing.'

Mr Osborne jetted into the second day of the G8 summit in Northern Ireland, determined to impress the world’s most powerful leaders with his plan to get tough with global tax dodgers.

But his pride suffered a major setback when the leader of the free world got him confused with R&B star Jeffrey Osborne – who most famously sang the 1980s hit One The Wings Of Love.

Mr Obama called him ‘Jeffrey’ three times, to the visible embarrassment of the Chancellor.

‘It was obvious Osborne didn’t  like being called “Jeffrey”,’ said a government source. ‘Why would he? His name is George.’

In fact the Chancellor’s real name is Gideon Oliver Osborne but switched to George aged 13 as a ‘small act of rebellion’.

Today the soul singer said he was delighted to get a namecheck at the G8 summit.

And in a bizarre twist suggested singing a duet up with the Chancellor.

Jeffrey Osborne told Sky News: 'I was really delighted, actually. I was really not aware that he was that much of a fan that he would call the Chancellor Jeffrey Osborne.

'Tell the Chancellor when I come over I will have to hook up with him and we will do a duet of On The Wings Of Love, or something.'

Jeffrey Osborne's entry in online encyclopaedia Wikipedia was edited by a mischievous user to reflect Mr Obama's inadvertent appointment of the singer to the Treasury.

After being tampered with, the entry read: 'Jeffrey Linton Osborne (born March 9, 1948) is an American funk and R&B musician, songwriter, lyricist, former lead singer of the band, L.T.D., and as of June 2013, is the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Second Lord of the Treasury of the United Kingdom.'

The bogus information remained online for under an hour before being erased.

Unattractive: David Cameron welcomed the US President to Lough Erne, but Mr Obama joked that Nick Clegg was the better=looking half of the coalition

Joke: Mr Osborne failed the see the funny side of the President's slip-up, which has become the talk of Westminster

The name gaffe by Mr Obama comes despite Mr Osborne boasting of his close links with the White House.

After delivering a 90-minute presentation on global data-sharing plans to stop companies and individual’s hiding their profits in tax havens, Mr Osborne was left deflated when Mr Obama responded: ‘Thanks for that, Jeffrey.’

Handsome: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg could not hide his delight at being described as better looking than the PM by President Obama

But the two men could not be more 
different. The Chancellor is the son of Sir Peter Osborne, 17th baronet 
of Ballintaylor and Ballylemon.

By contrast the father of singer-songwriter Jeffrey Osborne  was Clarence "Legs" Osborne, a trumpet player who played with Duke Ellington and Count Basie.

He had a total of 12 children but died when Jeffrey was just 13.

In an attempt to make amends, Mr Obama insisted that he did know Mr Osborne’s name really.

‘I’m sorry, man. I must have confused you with my favourite R&B singer,’ he said.

Mr Osborne was not the only UK minister to be left put out by the President.

When Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg arrived in Lough Erne, Mr Obama greeted him with a swipe at David Cameron, The Sun reported.

‘It's good to see the better looking half of the Coalition,’ he said.

Today Mr Clegg could barely contain his delight at the compliment.

He told his LBC 97.3 radio phone-in: 'These things happen. Any observer looking at the three of us would conclude that the people who looks the coolest is Obama.'

The Lib Dem leader suggested Mr Cameron had not heard the jibe: 'It was quit a scrum as we were going towards a lunch.'
