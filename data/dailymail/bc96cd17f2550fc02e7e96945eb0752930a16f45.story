Solicitation: Georgia investigators allege that Roberts used his position of authority and town resources to solicit sex from minors

The police chief of a small town in Georgia was arrested Wednesday after a months-long investigation into whether he used his position of authority and town resources to solicit sex from underage boys.

Molena police chief and city manager James Roberts was denied bond on Thursday as he's being held on two counts of solicitation of sodomy and one count of theft by conversion.

Roberts, who also serves as the mayor of nearby Concord, allegedly used his standing in the county to solicit sex from two young men, even providing one with gas on the county's dime.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation began looking into Roberts after the grandparents of one minor Roberts pursued reported it to the Pike County Sheriff's Office, according to the  Journal-Reporter.

GBI investigators searched both the Molena and Concord city halls, along with the Molena police station and Roberts's home.

According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, they found that Roberts had texted obscene images to one minor using a phone provided by the city.

Investigators also found that the police chief had given another young man a key and code that allowed him to fill up his own personal vehicle with gasoline paid for by the county.

The towns have a little more than 700 residents between them, though so far it seems the alleged crimes were confined to Molena.

Concord Mayor Pro Tem John Strickland told the Journal-Constitution that Roberts presided over a city council meeting Tuesday and that officials had no idea he was being investigated.

When investigators showed up to Concord city hall on Wednesday,  they inspected computers for evidence.

'We will try to get the council together [Thursday] to go over what’s gone on with these accusations,' said Strickland. 'The city of Concord’s not implicated in anything here.' 

Molena officials are also likely to speak about the situation with Roberts when they convene Thursday for a scheduled budget meeting.

'We’re in limbo at the moment trying to absorb everything,' said Molena Mayor Jay Garner.
