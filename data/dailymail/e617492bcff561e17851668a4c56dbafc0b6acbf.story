This is the shocking moment a mugger punched an autistic teenager and stole her bag, as a passer-by failed to even look up from his mobile phone.

The white man, believed to be in his early 20s, attacked the 18-year-old woman as she walked through an underpass in Walthamstow, north-east London, on her way to visit her grandmother.

The woman, who was carrying bags from high street stores JD Sports and Complete Entertainment Exchange, was pictured on CCTV at Billet Roundabout last Saturday just after 2pm.

As she was walking under the roundabout, a man on a bicycle approached her and demanded her property. She told him to go away but he refused, and his behaviour soon became violent.

However, while the attack unfolded, another man walked past the attacker and victim, either unaware or choosing to ignore what was happening - and instead concentrating on his phone.

The suspect - described as 5ft 11in, of slim build with short dark hair and a brown moustache - punched her a number of times in the head before wrenching her bag off her and cycling away.

Detectives are releasing CCTV images of the man - who was wearing grey tracksuit trousers and top with a white motif on the front of the top - as part of an appeal to the public to help to identify him.
