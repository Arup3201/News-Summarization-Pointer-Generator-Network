A spurned lover who stabbed his ex's new boyfriend 29 times has been jailed for life for murder.

James Burton launched the savage attack on Matthew Dunn after he started a relationship with Aimee Radley, who was the mother of Burton's child.

Petrified Miss Radley jumped out a window to escape Burton during the attack and he rained objects down on her before trying to kill himself.

Burton even threatened Miss Radley from the dock after he was sentenced this week, shouting to the court's public gallery: 'Tell Aimee I'll be out one day.'

He was jailed for life and ordered to serve at least 30 years behind bars after a judge found he showed had no remorse and had no mitigation.

Mr Justice Blake said: 'You showed callous indifference to the suffering of the victim, and were full of obsessive jealousy.

'When he was dead you went through his pockets to find his mobile phone so you could pursue your jealous obsession about their relationship.

'Matthew was a hard-working decent man and I've read with sorrow the statements of relatives and his mother is devastated by the loss. Aimee Radley found him a loving partner.'

Burton, 32, who smokes cannabis and has a borderline personality disorder, harassed and stalked his former lover for months, Leicester Crown Court heard.

He crouched outside her home in Hinckley, Leicestershire, for more than two hours on the morning of January 24, before bursting in and attacking Mr Dunn, 23.

Burton was carrying a hunting lock knife and a rucksack containing four pieces of rope, two formed into nooses, lighter fluid and three sets of cable ties fashioned into makeshift handcuffs.

Miss Radley, 24, jumped from the window with her baby in her arms when Burton went upstairs and threatened to kill her. Burton then threw objects at her as shocked passers-by rushed to help, the court heard.

Police at the scene in Hinkley, Leicestershire in January after Burton killed Mr Dunn and attempted suicide

Body camera footage from police officers who arrived at the scene then showed Burton's failed attempt at suicide as he leapt from the same bedroom window with a noose around his neck.

Burton, of Earl Shilton, Leicestershire, was unanimously convicted of murder this week. 

He had admitted making threats to kill and inflicting GBH on another person but was cleared of threatening to kill his son.

Relatives of young father Mr Dunn, a plastics worker from Wednesbury, West Midlands, described him as their 'rock'.

In a statement released after the sentencing, they said: 'Matthew was always happy and very thoughtful.

'He was a hard worker who loved fishing and music. Matthew loved his beautiful boy and was a great dad and uncle.

'He didn't deserve to have his life taken from him from us so tragically at only 23. The saddest thing is that Matthew's son will grow up without a father in his life.

'The only comfort is that we will always have a part of Matthew in him. He has left a huge void in the life of all who knew and loved him.'
