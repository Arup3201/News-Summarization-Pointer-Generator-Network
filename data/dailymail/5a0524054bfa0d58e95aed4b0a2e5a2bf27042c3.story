Two Belgian companies have joined forces to create one of the world's most a unique aircraft: a plane featuring childhood animated favourite, Tintin.

The cartoon, developed by Belgian artist Hergé, provided the inspiration for this one of a kind Airbus A320.

Together, Brussels Airlines and Moulinsart had been working on this secret project for several months.

Wife of Hergé, Fanny Rodwell, was on hand for the unveiling of a plane based on her husband's cartoon, Tintin

Two Belgian companies, Brussels Airlines and Moulinsart, came together for the bespoke aircraft design

Based on Professor Calculus' shark submarine from the adventure series, the long black shark aircraft was bapitised 'Rackham.'

On the side of the fuselage, it reads: 'We fly you to the home of Tintin.'

Tintin, who travels the world on his adventurous quests, is a natural travel partner for Brussels Airlines, who has also partnered with many other Belgian talents, such as the national football team and the country's largest music festival.

The Airbus A320 took several months to create and was done entirely in secret

For the painting of the aircraft, Brussels Airlines hired plane paint artist Andre Eisele, who had to adapt the perspective of the drawings to the unusual curves of a plane.

Eisele was also tasked with getting the aircraft looking as close to the original shark submarine design as possible.

The entire paint job took 1500 hours in total.

'This aircraft is a dream come true,' Nick Rodwell, Director of Moulinsart, said.

'The partnership with Brussels Airlines is a perfect marriage for us.'

One of Eisele's biggest challenges was adapting the perspective to the unusual curves of a plane

The creators call Tintin and Brussels Airlines a 'perfect marriage' as both are passionate about adventure

'Tintin is all about Belgium, all about Brussels, where he was born, as was Hergé. 

Tintin is also all about adventure and travelling, and with this plane we bring our two worlds together perfectly.' 

Following its unveiling, Rackham's maiden voyage took place: an hour and 45 minute flight to Toulouse. 

The aircraft will remain in use until 2019.
