A Game of Thrones Fan sent an official request to Wigan Council, asking what plans were in place to protect the town from a dragon attack.

The request topped a list of the most bizarre requests sent to local councils under the Freedom of Information act.

The second 'wackiest' request asked how many animals had been frozen in Cambridge since March 2012, while Rossendale Council was asked how often it had used exorcists' services on children and pets.

Another curious resident asked Southend Council how many children in its area had been micro-chipped.

The list was published by the Local Government Association, which represents local councils.

It used the list to illustrate how it believes resources are being diverted to from vital services to deal with these requests.

The association also complained that firms were 'exploiting the system' by trying to find out information on existing suppliers to help them bid for public contracts.

Peter Fleming, chairman of the LGA's Improvement Board, said: 'While the majority of requests to councils are for details of council policy and expenditure, some of the FOI requests received do not relate very closely to the services they are focused on providing every day of the year.

'Councils are working very hard to keep local communities running as efficiently as possible during these challenging financial times and anything which distracts from that can affect the value for money that taxpayers receive.'

Coming into force in 2005, FOI laws 
handed the public the chance to ask for recorded information from public
 bodies. A request must be processed within 20 working days.

This can include councils, government departments, police authorities, NHS trusts and state schools.

Public
 bodies can refuse an FOI request if it is considered to be vexatious, 
would cost too much to comply with, or if the information is exempt from
 disclosure.
