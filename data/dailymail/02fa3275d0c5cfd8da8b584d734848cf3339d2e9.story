Thousands of Australians have been duped by a fake Qantas Facebook page offering the chance to win free first class flights for the rest of the year.

Almost 150,000 people shared a post by the fraudulent site after it was first created on Sunday.

'Today we at Qantas Australia are proud to announce that we have seated over 3 Million passengers since January 1, 2015!' the post read.

'So to celebrate this record setting accomplishment we will be giving out FREE first class flights for the rest of this year! That's an entire year of FREE flights! To win simply complete the step's below.'

It encouraged people to like and share a picture of a Qantas First Class Lounge 'complimentary invitation', saying that winners will be notified on Tuesday.

The airline confirmed it is a scam and has nothing to do with Qantas. 

'Our campaigns are always run from our authenticated Facebook page (identified by its authorised blue tick), or through the official Qantas website,' a Qantas spokesperson said.

Qantas also reported the page to Facebook and it has been removed.

'We are aware of a fake Facebook account masquerading as Qantas Facebook fans are invited to like and share a post to win free First class flights,' a spokeswoman said.

'Qantas has already had a number of the scam pages removed.

'Facebook has been advised of the scam.'

Online scammers often create fake social media accounts linked to major companies in order to 'farm likes' and build up a page's following, so that it can be sold to other scammers to market dodgy products. 

The airline has moved to distance itself from the page, labelling it a 'scam'
