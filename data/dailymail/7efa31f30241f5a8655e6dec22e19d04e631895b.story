West Ham United striker Andy Carroll could well have travelled further than the England squad this summer after arriving at Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.

The 25-year-old has already been to Dubai and Las Vegas with girlfriend Billi Mucklow, as well as having attended West Ham team-mate Joey O'Brien's wedding in Dublin, but his touring does not look like abating any time soon.

Having already travelled more than 12,000 miles, he could well cover more distance than Roy Hodgson's men this summer following their elimination from the World Cup at the group stages.

Girlfriend Mucklow tweeted photos of the trip to the famous landmark accompanied with the caption: 'Loving life @ Golden Gate Bridge.'

Hammers striker Carroll endured a frustrating year in the Premier League last season, managing 15 appearances and scoring just twice due to persistent injury problems, potentially costing him a place in the England squad to Brazil.

He signed permanently for the East London club last summer in a £15million deal following a season-long loan from Liverpool.

The Merseysiders signed Carroll from hometown club Newcastle United in January 2011 for a then record fee for a British player of £35m.
