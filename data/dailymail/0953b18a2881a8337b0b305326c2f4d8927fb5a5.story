AS excuses for drink-driving go, it sounded as creative as some of his rap lyrics.

Singer Professor Green yesterday admitted jumping into his £100,000 Mercedes sports car while over the limit.

However, he insisted it was to protect his heiress wife Millie Mackintosh, who he feared was going to be killed by a mugger.

Rapper Professor Green, pictured arriving at Bromley Magistrates' Court today, was fined £525, ordered to pay court costs and banned from driving for a year after pleading guilty to a charge of drink-driving

Professor Green held the hand of his wife Millie Mackintosh as he left Bromley Magistrates' Court following the hearing today. He pleaded guilty to drink-driving on November 3 last year in Lewisham, south-east London

The musician said he had screamed at 
the Made In Chelsea star to run off when he was robbed of his £40,000 
Rolex outside their home as they returned from a nightclub.

Fearing
 the attacker would then chase after Miss Mackintosh, 24, he got into 
the car to try to find her – inadvertently smashing into a parked van.

When
 police arrived on the scene, they arrested Professor Green – whose real
 name is Stephen Manderson – for drink-driving. However, his problems 
worsened when officers later said he was being investigated for 
perverting the course of justice over the mugging excuse.

This
 charge was never brought but at Bromley Magistrates’ Court yesterday, 
Manderson, 30, admitted drink-driving and was banned for 12 months.

Professor Green, pictured arriving at Bromley Magistrates' Court with his wife Millie Mackintosh this morning, is said to have got behind the wheel of his Mercedes after fearing his TV star wife was being chased by an attacker

Quality
 Street heiress Miss Mackintosh accompanied her husband at court 
yesterday, dressed in a mix of high street clothes and designer 
accessories which she later detailed on Twitter.

The
 celebrity couple were apparently targeted last November at their 
£1.5million townhouse in South-East London after returning by taxi from a
 boozy night of clubbing.

The court heard Manderson did not notice the 
mugger until going down to the basement entrance of the home when he 
couldn’t get into the front door because the lock was stiff.

Defending, David Hislop QC said a man stepped out of the darkness and grabbed Manderson’s wrist, ripping off his Rolex.

The 30-year-old rapper, pictured, arrived at Bromley Magistrates' Court, Kent, this morning to face a charge of drink-driving following his arrest on suspicion of drink-driving last year

Professor Green, left, was arrested in November last year just two months after he married Made In Chelsea star Millie Mackintosh, right, in a lavish ceremony at Babington House near Frome, Somerset

‘He
 screamed out to his wife to run because he feared for her safety,’ Mr 
Hislop said. ‘Then he tried to fight off his assailant and during the 
course of that he heard his wife scream and thereupon decided to give up
 on the watch to see where she was. She had run off.

‘The
 assailant then mentioned he recognised him and said, “where is your 
missus going?”, and was off. He believed that she was being chased by 
him. He panicked.’

The 
rapper, who had a No1 hit in 2011 with Read All About It featuring 
vocalist Emeli Sandé, jumped into the Mercedes-Benz SLS and drove a 
short distance searching for his wife at 2.30am.

On hearing her scream 50 metres behind him, he reversed hitting a parked van.

Manderson then stopped three passers-by and used their phone to dial 999 because he lost his mobile in the scuffle.

Professor Green was arrested on suspicion of drink-driving on November 3. His arrest came after police attended reports that a man had been robbed in the road where he lives in Lewisham, south-east London

Professor Green, whose real name is Stephen Manderson, right, arrived at Bromley Magistrates' Court hand-in-hand with his wife, Made In Chelsea star Millie Mackintosh, left, this morning

But
 when police arrived, officers did not believe his story about the car 
chase and arrested him for drink-driving. A breath test revealed he was 
over the limit, registering 52 micrograms of alcohol in 100ml of breath.
 The legal limit is 35.

When Manderson answered bail on November 25 he was arrested for perverting the course of justice.

Mr
 Hislop claimed police told the rapper they would drop the allegation if
 he admitted making up the robbery and drink-driving.

However, Mr Hislop
 said it was ‘ludicrous’ to suggest the story was fiction. In the event,
 prosecutors decided not to charge him with perverting the course of 
justice.

Made In Chelsea star Millie Mackintosh gripped her husband's hand ahead of his court appearance today

Rapper Professor Green, pictured arriving at Bromley Magistrates' Court today, was fined £525, ordered to pay court costs and banned from driving for a year after pleading guilty to a charge of drink-driving

Yesterday District Judge Vanessa Lloyd ordered him to pay a 
£400 fine plus a £40 statutory surcharge and £85 court costs.

He was 
also disqualified from driving for 12 months.

Manderson’s
 wife was by his side as he left court. The couple met in 2011.

Despite 
their disparate backgrounds the rap artist, who hails from a council 
estate, and the privately educated socialite immediately hit it off and 
they married in Babington House, Somerset last year.

The
 24-year-old later quit her role on Made In Chelsea and has since carved
 out a niche as a health, beauty and lifestyle blogger and brand 
ambassador for Claire’s, the High Street accessory chain.

After the 
hearing, Manderson blasted police saying: ‘I’m upset that it took this 
long to get to here. I am however happy we came across a judge who was 
fair and understanding with the circumstances that led to this – unlike 
other people we’ve met along the way.’

Made In Chelsea star Millie Mackintosh, pictured, wore leather trousers, a black jacket, black heels, sunglasses and a dark hat as she arrived at Bromley Magistrates' Court with her husband this morning

Made In Chelsea star and Quality Street heiress Millie Mackintosh looked stylish as she arrived at Bromley Magistrates' Court this morning

Millie Mackintosh played the role of supportive spouse with textbook aplomb at Bromley Magistrates' Court today.

And anyone with a similar date in their diary could do well to take notes.

So, what does a stylish girl wear for such a public appearance? Zara, of course.

The
 Made In Chelsea reality TV star posted a photo of herself on Instagram 
yesterday in the changing room of the Spanish-owned store.

She
 was trying on a cream crop top with a pencil skirt (accessorised by a 
set of killer abs) so may well have picked up this Zara Multicolour 
Woven Fabric Jacket, £89, which she's wearing today.

She
 teamed the jacket with a suitably sombre black top and a pair of 
figure-hugging leather pants – accessorised with a simple black pump, 
one of her signature fedoras, a suitably stealth wealth tote by Aspinal 
and a pair of Miu Miu’s Noir Glitter sunglasses.

The
 overall look: a more rock ‘n’ roll version of Breakfast at Tiffany's 
Holly Golightly accused with giving the ‘weather report’ to Sally 
Tomato.

The court heard how Professor Green got behind the wheel while over the drink-drive limit because he thought his Made In Chelsea star wife Millie Mackintosh, pictured arriving at court with her husband today, was being chased by an attacker
