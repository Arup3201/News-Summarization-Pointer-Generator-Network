A 13-year-old boy has committed suicide after enduring years of bullying for being small, his devastated family and friends have revealed.

The bullies tormented Johnathon Short-Scaff over his slight stature - he weighed just 89 pounds - and even told him to kill himself the day before his death, his best friend said.

On Wednesday, the teenager was found hanged in his bedroom at his family's Scioto County, Ohio home by his older sister.

His mother, Trisha Howard Scaff, said her son, who had often tried to hide that he'd been bullied, had been his usual friendly, smiley self just an hour earlier.

Loss: Jonathon Short-Scaff, 13, was found dead in his bedroom last week after enduring years of bullying

'I got home from work that morning, and he rushed out to the van, and even opened up the van door for me,' she told WOWK. 'He said, "Hey Mom. How was your first day at work?" Not an hour later is when we found him.'

She said that he had been bullied for years over his height and had taken his concerns to the principal of Minford Middle School, where he was a student. But nothing changed, she said. 

'People made fun of him for being so little all through school,' says Trisha. 'But last year is when it starting going pretty far.'

His best friend, Jordan Fyffe, said Johnathon was picked on for not being able to keep up with sports players at school. He said he witnessed the bullies taunting Johnathon just a day before his death.

'When I heard, "Go kill yourself," I turned to Scaff, and asked, "Did those guys just tell you to go kill yourself?"' Fyffe said. 'He looked at me and teared up, because he knew what was happening.

'I asked, "Are you alright?" He said, "yes. I'm tough. I'll get through this." I said, "Yes, you are".' 

After football practice, he waited for Johnathon, he told WBNS.

'He came back up with a bunch of bruises and a cut beneath his eye,' Fyffe recounted. 'He started crying and I asked him, "Are you alright?" He said, "'I'll be fine".'

The school district has refused to comment.

The Scioto County Sheriff is conducting an investigation on the death, and Jordan and Johnathon’s sister have been questioned about the bullying. An autopsy is also being carried out.

Heartbroken: His devastated mother, Trisha Scaff, said that the school had failed to stop the bullies

At a loss: His best friend, Jordan Fyffe, said he had heard bullies telling Johnathon to kill himself a day before his death and that his friend had become emotional - but promised him he'd be okay

'Bottom line is, this bullying has got to stop, and these schools have got to take it more serious,' his mother said.

On Facebook she said she hoped that the bullies would be dealt with appropriately. 

His parents now plan on moving to another home, his mother said.
