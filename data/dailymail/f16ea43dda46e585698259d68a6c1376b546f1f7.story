Amazon plans to build a trio of 65,000-square foot glass domes in Seattle as parts of its new headquarters to take on Apple's plans for 'spaceship' headquarters in Silicon Valley, San Francisco.

The domes will be filled with plants and have been dubbed 'biospheres'.

All the plants will be chosen specifically to survive in the microclimate of the domes that has also been designed to be comfortable for Amazon employees to work in.

Amazon's plans for a biosphere office resembles a greenhouse or conservatory. The three intersecting domes replace an earlier plan for a six-story office building. It will be full of plants and will be built over five floors

Amazon's domes will be built in the shadow of a skyscraper that the online retailer is also planning to build. Both the skyscraper and the domes will sit between 6th and 7th Avenue in Seattle

The proposals were submitted earlier this week at Seattle City Hall's Design Review Board and explain that the domes will have botanical zones arranged around office areas, a canteen and lounge.

The plans explain that the domes will be 'a plant-rich environment that has many positive qualities that are not often found in a typical office setting.'

Architects NBBJ have designed the buildings and its ecosytem. 

To achieve this Amazon will be creating the zones based on findings from studies that look into how plants and organisms live in mountain ranges around the world.

The domes and office space will be spread over five floors with shops and a kitchen on the ground floor, more shops on the first floor and office space on levels two to five.

Models and a proposal of the plan have been submitted to Seattle City Hall's Design Review Board earlier this week for review. The domes will take up 65,000 square foot. The first two floors will be shops. The top three floors will have office space, canteen and lounges all surrounded by plants

The first floor of the dome structure will have a kitchen, lobby and shops. The first floor will have more shops and then Amazon employees will work on floors two, three, four and five. Amazon proposes to place plants throughout the domes that can survive in the microclimate while still being comfortable for the employees

Amazon has also previously submitted plans to build a skyscraper on the same location in Seattle between 6th and 7th Avenue.

The proposals do not say when the buildings will be completed and the completion date is expected to be announced once the plans have been reviewed.

Plans for Apple's 'spaceship' headquarters were first submitted to planning officers in August 2011.

It was billed as 'the best office building in the world' but this title could now be under threat from Amazon's glass domes. 

These incredible images show exactly what the firm's new Apple Campus 2, in Cupertino, California, will look like when completed in 2016.

Last month Apple submitted new plans with updated landscaping plans, a slightly revised floor plan, renderings, and a bicycle plan, however the main design hasn't changed.

Appearing as a giant saucer, amidst a dense jungle of trees, the 175-acre Silicon Valley site near the 280 Highway will house 13,000 staff.

Dubbed 'The Spaceship' because of its 360-degree curved glass fronted walls and central courtyard, it will also contain a 1,000 seat auditorium, a gym and 300,000 square feet of 'research' space.

The 2.8 million square foot HQ will have underground parking, so that 80 per cent of the site can be covered in trees - and clean energy sources, primarily natural gas, will provide its power. The local energy grid will only be accessed in emergencies.

Workers strolling around its exterior may think they are in the middle of the countryside, and not in the middle of a bustling city

In 2011 Steve Jobs said his firm was 'growing like a weed' and that it had 'a shot at building the best office building in the world'.The company's current Cupertino office, called 1 Infinite Loop and which will still be used by the firm, can only fit around 2,600 people. Apple has had to rent buildings to house its other 10,000 employees.

Concept images released in April, as well as images originally submitted in 2011 by Cupertino City Council show workers strolling outside the building.

The design is meant to make them feel like they are in open countryside.

But by looking at the overhead impression, below, it is clear they will, in fact, be in the middle of a bustling city.

Apple CEO Steve Jobs presented the 
plans for the spectacular circular-shaped HQ, on former Hewlett-Packard 
property, to Cupertino City Council in June 2011.

He
said his firm was 'growing like a weed' and added: 'We do have a shot 
at building the best office building in the world. I really do think 
architecture students will come here to see this.'

Workers may think they are in a rural paradise, but from this aerial image it is clear they are in the middle of a city

These images were released by Cupertino City Council in 2011, which is in favour of the development. Apple submitted updated plans in April this year that included tweaked floor plans, renderings and a bicycle plan. More than 80 per cent of the office will be surrounded by trees - similar to Amazon's plans to fill its biospheres with plants

The new site has been dubbed 'The Spaceship'. Its internal layout is similar to the Pentagons with toilets and kitchens situated at set points throughout the circular design

The company’s current Cupertino office, called 1 Infinite Loop and which will still be used by the firm, can only fit around 2,600 people. This has seen Apple renting buildings to house its other 9,000 employees.

During a 20-minute presentation on the new project in 2011, Steve Jobs said: 'It's a pretty amazing building. It's a little like a spaceship landed. There is not a straight piece of glass in this building.'

Architects Foster and Partners are working with ARUP North America and Kier & Wright engineers on the scheme.

Apple has already outgrown its headquarters in Cupertino (pictured) and needs to move, but will still keep this site when the 'spaceship' headquarters opens in 2016
