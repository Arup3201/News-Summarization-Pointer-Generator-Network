This is the look of terror a woman pulled for her jailhouse mugshot after being booked over driving offenses.

Ashley Stabler, 23, was pulled over by sheriff's deputies in Tulsa County, Oklahoma, last week and locked up after allegedly driving without insurance and on a suspended license.

She was also booked over driving with improper license plates, and thrown in the Tulsa County Jail - where she pulled this shocked expression for her mugshot.

According to The Smoking Gun, Stabler was being held on a $600 bond ahead of a court appearance, the date for which has now passed. 

Is is unclear what has become of Stabler since. She was due in court last week, and the Tulsa jail confirmed they are no longer holding her.

However, court records show Stabler's shock may have been unwarranted - as it was far from her first time in a jail.

She was arrested for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon in 2011, but the case was dismissed.

Two years later, she pleaded no contest to a larceny charge, and also has a pending court case linked to her driving suspension.
