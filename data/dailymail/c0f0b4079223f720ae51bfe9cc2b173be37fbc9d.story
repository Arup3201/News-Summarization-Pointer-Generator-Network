Tragic: Claire Lee, 34, was a fitness fanatic and played touch rugby for the Channel Island Guernsey

A British mother-of-two has died while ‘sandboarding’ down a 100m dune in Africa, it emerged yesterday.

Fitness fanatic Claire Lee, 34, was trying the extreme adventure sport – known as ‘snowboarding on sand’ – for the first time.

Her husband Barney and their two children are said to be devastated.

Mrs Lee, who worked as a lawyer, was visiting an extreme fitness camp in the Okonjima safari reserve.

But after sliding down a giant slope she collapsed and bystanders were unable to revive her.

Local reports suggest that the keen cyclist and touch rugby player may have suffered internal injuries after tumbling over.

But the Namibian sandboarding firm which organised the session claims her death was triggered by a pre-existing medical condition.

Authorities in the southern African country are awaiting autopsy results to determine the cause of death.

Mrs Lee was in Namibia with her personal trainer, Jon Le Tocq, whose firm Storm Force Fitness organises three day escapes to the retreat.

Clients take part in an array of sports and fitness and motivational exercises there to ‘realign and rejuvenate’ their bodies.

Mr Le Tocq confirmed that the fatal accident took place near the coastal city of Swakopmund, west of the capital Windhoek, last Wednesday.

He said: ‘Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with the family of our friend. She was a member of our small group on holiday in the country At this time we are unable to comment further.’

The company which organised the sandboarding trip, Alter-Action Sandboarding, describes itself as the ‘first professional sandboarding operation on the Namibian coast’.

Its website says: ‘With time and experience, Alter-Action developed the safest and most effective method of sliding on the dunes. The “perfect” sandboarding dune was chosen – a star dune with six different faces and a towering height of 100m.’

Founder Beth Sarro said Mrs Lee had been sandboarding for two hours before she collapsed.

Miss Sarro said: ‘She was sandboarding with us and had just completed a run where she went down a sand dune lying down.

‘She completed the run safely but said she felt funny, then she just collapsed. Someone she was travelling with tried to resuscitate Claire.

‘We were told after the incident that she suffered from a pre-existing heart condition but we had not been told about this. She appeared to be fine on the trip up until this point.’

Temperatures in Namibia can hit daily highs of 88F (31C) in December. The rest of the group were due back home at the weekend.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it was providing consular assistance to her family, who live on the Channel Island of Guernsey.

Visitors to the Storm Force Fitness camp receive a 12-week training plan to prepare for activities including running, cycling, motivational coaching and core-strengthening.

The firm’s website describes its courses as ‘truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to free yourself from the never ending “to do list” of life’.

Mrs Lee’s family have declined to comment in detail but a female relative said they were still waiting to find out exactly how she died.

Her husband Barney, a partner in Guernsey law firm Mourant Ozannes, is said to be too distraught to discuss his loss.

The company’s managing director, Jessica Roland, said: ‘We are devastated by the news and our thoughts and prayers are with the family.’

Mrs Lee represented Guernsey in several touch rugby tournaments.

Guernsey Touch chairwoman Katrina Bray said: ‘Her huge smile, amazing personality and sunny disposition will be remembered by so many who played beside her. Our thoughts and prayers are with Barney, their children, and their family.’
