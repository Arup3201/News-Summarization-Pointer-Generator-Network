Spain dominated the club game in Europe and all over the planet in 2014, with Real Madrid lifting the European Cup and the World Club Cup.

The capital truly was the centre of Spanish football, with Diego Simeone leading Atletico Madrid to an unlikely La Liga title. And to make it better for Madristas, Barcelona did not win a thing.

There were also two blokes called Ronaldo and Messi. They weren't bad either.

Here's Sportsmail's A-Z of Spanish football in 2014. 

A for Atletico

Diego Simeone’s team became the first since Rafa Benitez’s Valencia in 2004 to break the big-two’s stranglehold on La Liga when they won it in May thanks to Diego Costa’s goals, Thibaut Courtois’ saves, some Crazy-Gang spirit, and the brooding boss who made them believe.

B for Bale v Bartra

There were six minutes left of the Copa del Rey final in April and extra-time beckoned with Real Madrid 1-1 against Barcelona. Gareth Bale was on the halfway line when he started his race with Marc Bartra, he ran off the pitch and back on it and still out-sprinted the defender to score the winner.

C for Court

Barcelona spent too much time there in 2014. They were taken to court by one of their own supporters over the Neymar transfer; and then went to the court of arbitration (CAS) over Fifa banning them from making transfers. Leo Messi went to court over tax evasion, and Luis Suarez also went to CAS to appeal a ban on him training with his new Barça team-mates.

D for La Decima

You may have heard Madrid supporters mention this once or twice. The tenth European Cup was finally won in Lisbon in May after 12 years of trying. They spent a billion and sacked 10 managers along the way but they got there with a 4-1 win over Atletico Madrid.

E for Englishman abroad

The first man Carlo Ancelotti embraced on the touchline at the final whistle was his No 2 Paul Clement. Becoming a No 1 somewhere will be the Londoner’s next step.

F is for El Fideo

Nicknamed ‘The Noodle’, Angel Di Maria began the year losing his place to Bale at Real Madrid but he ended up playing alongside Bale, scoring in the Spanish Cup final, winning Man of the Match in the Champions League final and moving to Manchester United.

G is for Diego Godin

The rock at the heart of  defence scored the goal that won the league for Atletico at the Nou Camp on the last day of the season.

H is for hoops

After 115 years of wearing stripes Barcelona revealed in December that they will wear hoops next season. The fans say it’s sacrilegious; the kit-makers say it’a lucrative – both are probably right.

I is for Iker

After a terrible World Cup Real Madrid’s legendary goalkeeper looked all washed up. But he’s back to his best and in November told Sportsmail: 'I want to play until I’m 40'.

J is for Jack Harper

Outstanding for Real in the UEFA Youth League the 18-year-old Scot is destined for big things both for club and country.

K is for Kroos

Not often Bayern Munich make a mistake in the transfer market. At €30million Toni Kroos looks the signing of the year.

L is for Liverpool legends

Kenny Dalglish flew to Barcelona in October to present another great former Liverpool No 7 Luis Suarez with the Golden Shoe. Suarez wanted the presentation to take place at Anfield but schedules did not allow. ‘Come any time, and bring your boots’ says Brendan Rodgers.

M is for Moyes

Never mind La Masia, welcome to ‘The Moyesia’. That is what Real Sociedad hope to be able to say in the coming years as David Moyes works his magic at their Zubieta youth academy. He took over in November.

N is for Neymar

He has already topped the nine league goals he scored in his first season. And he’s kept himself busy off the pitch, flying model Soraja Vucelic into Barcelona in October.

O is for odd signings

Barcelona needed to rebuild their defence this summer. They signed Sao Paolo right back Douglas for £4.4m and Thomas Vermaelen for £15m. They have started one league game between them.

Thomas Vermaelen has been hit by a string of injuries since signing for Barcelona in the summer 

P is for promoted

Eibar won promotion to the top flight in May for the first time in their 75-year history – great news for the 5,000 fans that cram into their stadium and for the 130 who watch from the tower blocks overlooking the ground.

Q is for quit

Barcelona president Sandro Rosell walked away in January. He had managed to upset Pep Guardiola, Johan Cruyff, Lionel Messi, the Spanish tax man, and FIFA during his three and a half year reign

R is for Ramos

Real were seconds from losing the European Cup in May when Sergio Ramos headed in the equalizer. At 28, he has already played over 300 Madrid games. Legend.

Sergio Ramos' header hauled Madrid back into the Champions League final, which they ended up winning

S is for seventeen

Some say Cristiano Ronaldo only scores so many goals because of weak La Liga defences. That will be why he only scored 17 in last season’s Champions League then.

T is for ‘Ta-ta Tata Martinez’

He chewed gum through press conferences, organised a mid-season barbecue to boost team-spirit, won nothing, and was gone by June.

U for Unai

Sevilla coach Unai Emery led his team to Europa League glory in May. His reward? The same as every other year – his best players were sold.

V is for Varane

Do you really want to be kicking the ball straight at Simeone when the Argentine has just let the European Cup slip? Simeone stormed on to the pitch to confront Raphael Varane and earned an eight-match ban.

W for waterworks

Sevilla full back Alberto Moreno was in floods of tears as he said goodbye to his team-mates in Spain in August. Some said it was because he was joining Liverpool.

X for Xavi and Xabi

Spain’s X-men retired from international football in August having won the lot.

Y is for yoga fan

Carles Puyol retired last May having lifted every in trophy imaginable. He has plenty more time now to lift girlfriend Vanesa Lorenzo as the pair practise Acro-Yoga together.

Z for Zarra Telmo

When Athletic Bilbao striker Telmo Zarra retired aged 34 in 1955 his haul of 251 La Liga goals looked unbeatable. Messi smashed the record this November, aged 27.
