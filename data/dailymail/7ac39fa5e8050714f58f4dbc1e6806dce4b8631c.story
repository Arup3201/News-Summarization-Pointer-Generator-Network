The surgeon who carried out Britain’s first hand transplant last night praised the donor’s family for bringing about good from the ‘awful tragedy of a loved one’.

Professor Simon Kay, who led the complex eight-hour procedure at Leeds General Infirmary, said their permission had to be sought soon after their relative’s sudden death on Boxing Day.

There is no tick box for ‘limbs’ on donor register forms so next-of-kin must be consulted ‘individually by the hospital’.

Life changing: Mark Cahill, pictured with wife Sylvia, underwent the first hand transplant on Boxing Day

The plastic surgeon said: ‘I really 
think we have to acknowledge the circumstances that this hand was given,
 at Boxing Day, at a time of enormous tragedy and loss. I would like to 
acknowledge the extraordinary gift.

‘Organ donation of any kind plucks something positive from that awful tragedy of a loss of a loved one.’

It is not known what tragedy befell the donor but sources say it was most likely to have been a car crash or a stroke.

Professor Kay spoke as the recipient, 
Mark Cahill, continued to recover in hospital and revealed that his next
 milestone is to be able to hold his three-year-old grandson’s hand for 
the first time.

Immediate success: Mr Cahill, pictured with Sylvia and surgeon Simon Kay,said he wonders who his new hand came from but will never know for data protection reasons

The 51-year-old former pub landlord, 
who lost the use of his right hand five years ago, said the implications
 of his surgery were still sinking in.

As he continued to marvel at being 
able to wiggle the fingers of his new hand, he said he hoped to regain 
his independence and enjoy family life to the full.

Speaking of his grandson Thomas, he said: ‘Anything I can do will be a bonus. Holding his hand is going to be great.’

Mr Cahill, from Greetland, West 
Yorkshire, lost the use of his right hand – and some from his left – 
when it became infected during a severe attack of gout, a condition he 
had suffered for 20 years.

‘I had to go into hospital to cut the infection out and it left me with a paralysed hand,’ he said.

He and his wife Sylvia, 47, had to 
leave their beloved village pub, the Shears Inn near Halifax, and he has
 been unable to work since.

‘It made it virtually impossible to do
 anything,’ he said. ‘My wife had to help me dress and cut my food up. 
You can imagine without any hands it’s very difficult.’

A friend told yesterday how so far, 
for all of Thomas’s life, Mr Cahill has had to settle for ‘just 
observing’ the little boy, rather than be able to play with him. ‘He’s 
the apple of his eye,’ the friend added.

Pioneer: Consultant plastic surgeon and professor of hand surgery, Simon Kay, began investigating the possibility of carrying out the UK's first hand transplant ten years ago

Mr Cahill’s operation nine days ago 
became a world first when his original hand was removed in the same 
procedure. While there have been 70 hand transplants world-wide, in 
those cases recipients had already lost the limb before the surgery.

Yesterday Professor Kay said it could 
be 18 months before the operation is considered a success. ‘If all goes 
well, I would hope he has quite strong grasp, and have good sensibility,
 a good ability to feel, and he’ll have a precision pinch,’ he said.

Mr Cahill, who has had psychological 
help to enable him to accept the new hand as his own, continues to be 
kept in isolation at hospital to reduce risk of infection.

‘The feelings
 are starting to come back and everything’s looking very good,’ he said.
 ‘It feels like my hand.’

After celebrating Christmas with his family, Mark Cahill was all set for a holiday with his wife in Goa.

But shortly after 8pm on Boxing Day he received the phone call telling him he was to undergo a hand transplant.

By 1pm the next day he was preparing for the eight-hour landmark surgery at Leeds General Infirmary.

Mr Cahill had been unable to use his 
right hand for five years after it became infected owing to severe gout,
 an acute form of arthritis caused by a build-up of uric acid in the 
blood.

He and his second wife Sylvia, who 
celebrated their 20th wedding anniversary last year, were forced to give
 up their beloved village pub, the Shears Inn in Greetland, near 
Halifax, because of his disability.

Mr Cahill, a former rugby league player, was also left wheelchair-bound at one point when the gout affected his spine.

He said: ‘Anything I have now is 
better than what I had before this operation. I’m hoping to eventually 
get back to work – I’m already moving my fingers and the doctors say I’m
 making quicker progress than they expected.’

Photographs posted by Mr Cahill on his
 Facebook page show his swollen hand before the operation and a painful 
infection on one of his fingers.

Mr Cahill said he was shocked when he 
was offered the ground-breaking surgery less than three months after he 
was added to the transplant register. ‘After a lot of tests, Professor 
Kay (the plastic surgeon who performed the operation) told me I could be
 a candidate for a hand transplant, and asked me to give it some 
thought.

Before the operation: Mark suffered from gout and his hand was left paralysed after becoming infected

‘I discussed it with my family and 
came back to Professor Kay in about October and told him I wanted to go 
ahead with it – so when I got the call on Boxing Day to say there was a 
donor I was gobsmacked.

‘I really expected quite a wait, and 
it was a bit of a gulp moment. Sylvia and I were meant to be going on 
holiday to Goa this week, but this is obviously a much better turn-out.’

When doctors learned that a hand 
suitable for transplant had become available they called in Mr Cahill 
for tests to check how his tissue matched with that of the donor.

He said: ‘I was called into the 
hospital along with another recipient, and they tested us to see which 
was the stronger match – and I was.’

Within hours the doctors began the 
gruelling surgery, which saw his hand removed and the replacement 
attached in the same operation.

surgery involved attaching his arm to the new hand using titanium plates

Mr Cahill added: ‘It didn’t feel real 
until I woke up after the operation. It felt like a dream, even when I 
was going into theatre.’

He added: ‘It’s how I expected it to 
look, because I’ve done a lot of research about hand transplants. But 
you can do all the research you want and you don’t know how you’re going
 to feel – I’ve had a lot of help from psychologists because the biggest
 thing is afterwards, whether I would accept it as mine.’

Mr Cahill, who has one daughter, Danielle, is full of gratitude to the family of the donor.

His wife added: ‘It was a wonderful 
thing to do. It must have been really difficult for them but I’ll always
 be grateful for the choice they made.’

Professor Norman Williams, President of the Royal College of Surgeons, said: 'This is yet another example of 
life-changing surgical advancements that are now possible.

'New surgical 
techniques together with a greater understanding of organ rejection are 
making an ever wider range of transplants possible. This presents opportunities 
for treating conditions and improving quality of life in ways that 
simply were not possible in the past.

'As with all procedures that improve the quality of life rather than 
save it, there is an ethical balance to be struck – especially as the 
lifelong anti-rejection medication that the patient would 
need to take carries its own risks.

'Care always needs to be taken in 
choosing suitable patients who understand the risks and benefits. This 
selection should be by a multi-disciplinary team of doctors which 
includes a psychologist or psychiatrist as a core-member of the 
selection team.'

Hand transplants have already been carried out by doctors in the United States, Austria and France leading the way for other transplant operations of such organs as the face, abdominal wall or larynx.

The first major organ to be transplanted successfully was a cornea, by Eduard Zirm in Olmutz, Czech Republic in 1905, but not until nearly 50 years later, in 1954, did doctors in Boston successfully transplant a kidney.

The first successful heart transplant was by Dr Christiaan Barnard in Cape Town, South Africa, in 1967, and was followed by the first heart and liver transplants in the UK the following year.

Not until 1983 did Britain see the first combined heart and lung transplant.

In 2005, the first partial face transplant was carried out, in Amiens, France where Isabelle Dinoire, a 38-year-old woman who had been mauled by her dog, was given a new nose, chin and lips.

Five years later the first full face transplant was carried out, in Barcelona, Spain, on a farmer known only as Oscar who had been injured in a shooting accident. He received the entire facial skin and muscles - including cheekbones, nose, lips and teeth - of a donor.

In October 2006, surgeon Peter Butler at London's Royal Free Hospital was given permission by the NHS ethics board to carry out a face transplant. His team will select four adult patients for operations.
