Let's hope these two chaps don't get any big ideas...

These two-year-old chimps, Vali and Sugriva, were taken to the opening night of the new blockbuster, Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes at their local cinema.

They were able to enjoy the full cinema experience at the BigD Auditorium at the Carmike Cinema, in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, including buying their own popcorn and juice.

The chimps, who live at the Myrtle Beach Safari, regularly watch television as a form of entertainment - and are big fans of the latest movie's predecessor, Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes.

Myrtle Beach Safari director Bhagavan Antle said the trip started as it would for most other people - with a trip to the confectionery stand where they got their popcorn and juice

Dr Antle said: 'They are smart - they knew to hand over the money to get their food and drinks'

After settling down in their seats however it was time for them to turn their attention to the film itself.

Dr Antle said: 'The older one, Vali, is a very bright guy, he's watched the Lord Of The Rings many times, and he could follow the whole plot of the movie.'

Dr Antle said Vali was able to judge the facial expressions and actions of the characters to determine which were the 'good guys' and which were the 'bad guys'.

He said: 'He loves to clap - when he likes something he claps, so he clapped for the good guys, and when chimps don't like what's happening they hoot or bark, so when the bad guy came on he was barking.'

The chimps were able to enjoy the film on its opening night surrounded by about 1,000 human viewers

The chimps watched the film with some 1,000 other cinema-goers at the IMAX screen in the cinema complex - although not everybody was too comfortable having them present.

Dr Antle said: 'A couple of people said very clearly "are you sure they should watch this movie, won't they learn to take over the world?"

'There were several people actually concerned about that.'
