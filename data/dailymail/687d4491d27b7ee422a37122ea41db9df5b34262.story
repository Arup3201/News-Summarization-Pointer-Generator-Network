Two men today appeared in court in the first British prosecution for female genital mutilation.

Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena, 31, a registrar at Whittington Hospital in Archway, north London, has been charged with one count of an offence contrary to the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003.

He will be tried alongside Hasan Mohamed, 40, who faces charges of encouraging an offence of female genital mutilation, when the case is heard at London's Southwark Crown Court in May.

Leaving the hearing: Mohamed, whose address was not read out in court, is charged with intentionally encouraging an offence of FGM under section 44(1) of the Serious Crime Act 2007

Mohamed also faces a charge of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring Dharmasena to commit an offence of female genital mutilation.

Both men indicated they would enter not guilty pleas at a hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court today.

Committing the case for a preliminary hearing at Southwark Crown Court on May 2, Deputy Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot said there was no legal precedent for a case of this kind.

‘This is the first offence of this type to go through the courts,’ she said.

Female genital mutilation has been a criminal offence in the UK since 1985 but new legislation in 2003 introduced a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.

The 2003 act also made it an offence for UK citizens to carry out or procure female genital mutilation abroad, even in countries where the practice is legal.

Dr Dharmasena, of Ilford, Essex, is charged with an offence contrary to section 1(1) of the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003. The section specifically forbids anyone from removing or mutilating part of a woman's genitals.

Mohamed, whose address was not read out, is charged with intentionally encouraging an offence of FGM under section 44(1) of the Serious Crime Act 2007. They were both granted unconditional bail.
