The Bilbao rout saw Ronaldo continue his dovetailing with fellow Madrid attackers Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale - a trio fans have dubbed the 'BBC.'

'We are still getting better, this is still the start of the season' said the record breaking scorer. 

'The BBC is working well. We are used to playing together and we keep scoring goals.'
