After decades of waiting for the fight the whole world wants to see, it now seems that Floyd Mayweather versus Manny Pacquiao could happen twice in one year.

Bob Arum, the PacMan’s promoter, is convinced that the two greatest pound-for-pound boxers on the planet will finally get it on in 2015.

Arum also believes that the carrot of a double-your-money re-match a few months later will clinch at last a deal which has proved more elusive than the Scarlet Pimpernel.

Clash of the titans: Manny Pacquiao (left) could face Floyd Mayweather (below right) twice in a year

 Since a first fight in May is projected to be the richest in ring history at $300 million, the prospect of raising the ante to more than half a billion dollars with a second clash in September next year will surely amount to an offer neither man can refuse.

The removal of two long-standing obstacles which have prevented Mayweather and Pacquiao getting into the same ring together has encouraged Arum to go public in America.

The major pay-per-view TV rivals in the US - HBO who screen Pacquiao’s fights and Showtime who have Mayweather under contract – are understood to be willing to share the massive financial pot via a joint-broadcasting contract.

Arum says: ‘Both networks want this to happen. All signs seem to point to a first fight early next year,’

Then the departure of Richard Schaefer from his post as chief executive at Golden Boy promotions, who organise Mayweather’s promotions, has led to a thaw in the long-running feud between that company and Arum’s Top Rank corporation.

Arum envisages that shift in positions making the two-fight deal negotiable. He says: ‘A second fight in the autumn would provide a different cash split because the winner of the first would claim the higher percentage. As each of them believes he would win, that provides an extra incentive.’ 

Pitching the idea: Pacquiao, throwing the ceremonial first pitch in San Francisco, could be willing to agree to a series of demands in order to fight Mayweather

Since the PacMan has agreed already to the Money man’s demands for Olympic-standard drugs testing and a bigger percentage of the purse for a first fight, it would seem that only Mayweather’s concern for his unbeaten record remains to be over-come.

And the biggest hint yet that he is ready to meet that challenge has come with him hinting at ‘a big surprise when I announce my next fight.’

Actually, since he meets Marcos Maidana in a rematch in Las Vegas on Saturday week, he means his fight after next.

That is planned in Sin City for May, which is good timing also for Pacquiao who fights Chris Alegieri in Macau this November.

Always assuming, of course, that both the main men successfully defend their world welterweight titles.

After that, time will begin running out for them to plunder the riches on offer right now.

Both Mayweather and Pacquiao are in their mid-30s and Arum reminds them: ‘There is a sell-by date after which…..who cares?’

Although the public appetite for them to meet remains ravenous, there are signs on social media of fans growing tired of all the excuses and delays.

Not that Mayweather and Pacquiao spending next year exclusively fighting each other would be the best of news for Britain’s own Amir Khan, who is hoping to cash in against one or other of them in 2015.

If boxing’s version of the No 10 bus materialises – you stand there all day, then two come along together – Khan will still be left waiting at the stop.

PS: In another sign that Mayweather is getting ready to bank his heftiest pay-cheques ever, he has been chilling out with American billionaire Warren Buffett. The aging mega-investor even changed into boxing kit at Mayweather’s gym in Las Vegas, where he gave the man called Money tips on how to make even more money from all the money he banks from boxing. ‘He’s cool,’ said Mayweather of Buffet. He’s also very, very shrewd.

Common sense prevails for Fury 

Tyson Fury, who erupted angrily when first charged with bringing boxing into disrepute, is said to be ready now to attend next Wednesday’s inquiry into his foul-mouthed outburst at a press conference.

Fury threatened initially to boycott the hearing but Robert Smith, general secretary of the British Boxing Board of Control, says: ‘We understand Tyson will come to explain and defend himself.’

That appearance, I understand, will ensure that Fury’s world heavyweight title final eliminator against Dereck Chisora goes ahead as re-scheduled on November 22 at London’s ExCeL Arena.

Common sense appears to be prevailing.

Not least because the potential prize of a championship challenge to Wladimir Klitschko is too big for Fury to refuse to accept a reasoned punishment – perhaps a fine and a caution - if found guilty.

Nor – after being marooned for so long by the withdrawals of David Haye (twice) then Chisora and consequently relegated from a world heavyweight top 10 – can he remain inactive any longer.

Frampton looking to sink Martinez in Titanic struggle

Belfast belter: Carl Frampton will look to beat Kiko Martinez again and retain his title

Barry McGuigan is presiding over the biggest fight in Belfast since the Clones Cyclone himself was in his exciting prime and filling the old King’s Hall to its rocking rafters.

Carl Frampton, McGuigan’s protegee, will fight this Saturday night before an even bigger crowd, in a yet more dramatic venue.

More than 16,000 will pack a temporary arena constructed in the Titanic Quarter, the dramatic commercial renovation of the shipyard site from which the doomed liner was launched.

Like his promoter and mentor, who famously dethroned featherweight knigs Eusebio Pedroza in the warm London summer of 1985, the impressive and undefeated Frampton is hoping to bring a world title to Northern Ireland.

Since he has beaten IBF super-bantamweight champion Kiko Martinez once already, Frampton is firm favourite to realise that ambition.

The Spaniard regrouped after that stoppage, in Belfast, to claim his belt in convincing fashion.

But with a fervent Ulster crowd anticipating even bigger nights in Belfast – against British rival Scott Quigg, Leo Santa Cruz and perhaps, eventually, Cuba’s super-bantam king Guillermo Rigondeaux – expect Frampton The Jackal to be a howling success this weekend.

*Frampton v Martinez will be televised live on BoxNation on Saturday night.
