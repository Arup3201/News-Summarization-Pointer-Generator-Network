Drivers of America, you've been warned. This summer, one of the first daughters will be out on the road.

Malia Obama turns 16 on July 4, making her eligible for a learner's permit in Washington, DC. She can apply for a provisional license to drive alone six months after that.

When talking about her daughters' summer plans, first lady Michelle Obama told Access Hollywood: 'One child is going to be driving this summer. Look out everyone!'

Chelsea Clinton was the last teen to learn how to drive in the White House, and it was dad Bill Clinton who sat in the passenger seat for lessons.

Then-first lady Hillary Clinton called the lessons 'scary' since her husband had been using a chauffeur for the 12 years prior.

'I think the president has been learning a lot by driving with Chelsea,' a spokesman with her office said in February 1996.

But don't expect President or Mrs Obama to take up the same teaching role with their daughter.

While Mrs Obama wouldn't elaborate on how a president's daughter goes about learning to drive under the protection of secret service, she said 'we've got a plan'.

'I think our [Secret Service] agents don't want us driving with teenagers ... Especially the president's detail. I don't think they want him in the state when she's learning how to drive,'Mrs Obama said on Live with Kelly and Michael last month. 'We will fortunately be able to hand that responsibility over to someone else.'

Malia was just 10 years old when her father was sworn in as president in January 2009. By the time he leaves office in January 2017, Malia will likely already be half-way through her first year of college.

Little-sister Sasha was 7 when Mr Obama became president, and will learn how to drive once her dad is out of office.
