Black Hawk helicopters and truck-sized X-ray machines that are typically used along the U.S.-Mexico border have been brought to the Super Bow venue to bolster security. 

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) showcased the technology on Monday in preparation for Sunday’s football game between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks at the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.

CBP Commissioner R. Gil Kerlikowske was on hand to detail key features of the agency's Black Hawks and the large mobile X-ray machines used to detect contraband and explosives.

The X-ray machines slowly pan outside a semi-truck while operators look for anomalies.

They are in heavy use at the Mariposa Port of Entry in Nogales, Arizona, one of the busiest ports of entry for commerce in the country.

Within a few minutes, the machines can scan an entire semi-trailer for explosives.

Tucson-based helicopters and Black Hawks will monitor the airspace around the game, which will be a no-fly zone while the game is on.

The Black Hawks are used by the CBP and the Border Patrol for a variety of missions, including rescuing sick and injured people as they cross the border. 

The large mobile X-ray machines that are used to detect contraband and explosives are usually deployed at the U.S.-Mexico border

The mighty machines have also recently been used to arrest so-called 'scouts,' or people acting as lookouts for drug and human smuggling organizations.

Mr Kerlikowske said Arizona's border with Mexico will still be secure while some equipment is used in Glendale.

He also said that the people that operate the technology provided by customs will play a key part in keeping everyone safe at the big game. 

‘The real key about this equipment is the people who operate them,’ Mr Kerlikowske said.

Customs and Border Protection is deploying about 100 officers to assist other federal and local law enforcement agencies at the game.
