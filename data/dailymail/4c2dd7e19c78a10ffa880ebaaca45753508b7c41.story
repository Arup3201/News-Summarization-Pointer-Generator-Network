A staffer for Miami Commissioner Francis Suarez, who is running for mayor, has been fired after berating constituents using her personal Twitter account, the Miami Herald reports.

In one message posted on Monday, Christina Haramboure, 24, wrote, 'Dear Constituents.... PLEASE GET A LIFE, A HOBBY, A LOBOTOMY... whatever.'

She complained about her job and having to address constituents' concerns. 

'It amazes me how much people like to call here & b**** at me ALLL DAY. their lives must really suck #leavemealone #socrabby #angryoldpeople,' she tweeted Monday from her handle, @ChristinaHam.

Later on she wrote, 'If you know all the answers then WHY ON EARTH are you calling. Give the sermon to yourself #spareme.'

In an interview with the Miami Herald, Suarez said he would keep Haramboure on staff, despite her tweets. He explained that she was frustrated on Monday, when she wrote some of the tweets, because a colleague was out sick and she was having to do extra work.

'She admitted and took responsibility for the messages,' Suarez told the newspaper. 'This is not the way we treat constituents.'

But Suarez later recanted his statements and announced that he had fired Haramboure.

'I want to first apologize to the residents of District 4 for the inappropriate and clearly offensive comments made by my commission aide,' he said in a statement released Wednesday. 'Her tweets are unacceptable and are in no way a reflection of the culture within my commission office, and furthermore there is no justification for the disturbing things that she posted.

'I have terminated her employment with my office. This incident does not reflect my track record or how I have served the residents of District 4.  Our office will continue to serve District 4 with utmost integrity while placing constituents first.'

Among her offensive tweets, Haramboure had written, 'Who did screw over yesterday to have this sh**storm of crazy people today?!

She later added: 'My emails could not possibly be any more sarcastic or passive aggressive today.'

Haramboure earned a $31,000 salary working for Suarez as an administrative assistant. She does not work for Suarez's mayoral campaign. 

In an email to the Miami Herald, the 24-year-old apologized for her remarks.

'Over the last two years, I have worked tirelessly to help hundreds of constituents, and I have made great personal sacrifices to continue serving the residents of District 4,' she said. 'I regret the Twitter postings and I apologize to anyone I may have hurt.'

Haramboure has a degree in biology from Florida International University.
