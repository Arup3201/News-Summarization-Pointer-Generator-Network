He was merciless in his mocking of fellow comedian Jimmy Carr over his shameless tax avoidance.

Foul-mouthed Frankie Boyle, 39, could not resist lampooning Carr after it emerged he used an off-shore scheme to pay as little as 1 per cent income tax.

In his newspaper column, Boyle joked: ‘Jimmy Carr has been attacked by Maxine Carr, who feels that he’s ruined the family’s good name.’

And he also wrote: ‘If you’re rich, don’t look at it as tax avoidance, look at it as a children’s hospital buying you a pool table.’

But close examination of Boyle’s own tax arrangements reveal that he may also be the beneficiary of sharp – but entirely legal – accountancy practices on the millions he has earned through TV shows, tours, DVDs and book sales.

According to one respected forensic accountant who examined Boyle’s publicly available company accounts, the Glasgow-based entertainer could have avoided paying nearly £900,000 tax through the voluntary liquidation of his firm last year.

The company in question was Traskor Productions Limited, which was incorporated in England and Wales on December 17, 2009. The sole director and shareholder of the firm – whose business was described as ‘artistic and literary creation’ – was comedian Francis (Frankie) Martin Patrick Boyle.

By September last year, Traskor had realisable assets valued at £3,083,884. This included a sum of £2,854,842, which Boyle had effectively lent to himself on the ‘director’s loan account’.

The liabilities were shown to be £873,388, which were mainly the money due to HM Revenue and Customs and probably VAT.

The following month, Boyle decided to wind up Traskor with the remaining cash in the company being extracted, in effect, by the comedian.

The estimated surplus, after the £8,590 cost of liquidating the firm and settling of liabilities including corporation tax and VAT, was expected to be £2,201,906.

If taken out as dividends or income, the marginal rate of tax which Boyle would suffer would have been at the 50 per cent top rate.

By taking the winding up route, Boyle may have been able to pay a tax rate of just 10 per cent. This is because he could have been entitled to ‘entrepreneur’ tax relief, saving him up to £880,762. Yesterday Boyle was uncharacteristically reticent when the Daily Mail sought a comment from him at his £1.2million three-storey sandstone mansion in Glasgow’s West End.

When he answered the door, the comedian was barefoot and wearing blue, striped pyjamas. He gave a dismissive wave of the hand and closed the door before a reporter could ask him why he opened and closed Traskor so quickly, and whether this allowed him to make huge tax savings.

Last night Boyle’s agent Hannah Chambers, who also represents Jimmy Carr, said: ‘Traskor Productions Limited was a company of Frankie’s which has now been wound-up. He was director and shareholder of it as you have identified. The company’s arrangements, its tax treatment and Frankie’s dealings in relation to the company were normal and legal.’

However, the forensic accountant who examined Boyle’s company accounts said the structure of the arrangements seemed to be ‘aiming’ to benefit from entrepreneur’s relief, ‘which will save him a lot of tax, if his personal tax situation is such that he is entitled to it’.

If he meets the qualifying conditions ‘there is nothing illegal about what he may be doing, but he could save a very large amount of tax potentially,’ the accountant added.

The comedian responded today, admitting that he had made a tax saving after winding up the company.

He tweeted: 'I wound my company up for legal reasons separate from tax and my accountant applied for tax relief on this.'

In his Sun newspaper column last week, Boyle revelled in the Carr tax scandal.

‘The only person paying less income tax at the Jubilee concert than Jimmy Carr and Gary Barlow was Lenny Henry – because he doesn’t earn any money,’ he joked.

And in a tweet he said: ‘It’s OK to avoid tax providing every time you do a joke about a town being s*** you add, “Partly down to me I’m afraid”.’ Boyle was a permanent panellist on the BBC’s Mock the Week for seven series and has made guest appearances on other panel shows including Have I Got News for You, Jimmy Carr’s 8 Out of 10 Cats, Would I Lie to You?, You Have Been Watching and Never Mind the Buzzcocks.

During his career, Boyle has gained a reputation for being offensive. He has caused controversy with his on-air comments about Katie Price and her disabled son Harvey.

Four years ago viewers complained when he said on Mock the Week that swimmer Rebecca Adlington ‘looks like someone who’s looking at themselves in the back of a spoon’.

The BBC ruled that the jokes were ‘humiliating’ and ‘risked offending the audience’, whilst also calling Boyle ‘a brilliant member of the team’.

The father-of-two later caused outrage by making obscene ‘sexist and ageist’ remarks about the Queen.
