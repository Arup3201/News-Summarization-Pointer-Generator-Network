An Adelaide woman has admitted trying to hire a hitman to murder her estranged husband.

Doris Ann Brundritt, 45, from Glanville in the city's northwest, pleaded guilty in the District Court on Monday to one count of solicit to murder between January 14 and 17, 2014 at in places including Cheltenham - a western suburb in Adelaide.

The court was told the Director of Public Prosecutions is considering whether to proceed with a second solicit charge, said to have occurred between January 1 to December 31, 2010 in Parra Hills West - a northern suburb in Adelaide which is about a 20 minute drive from Cheltenham.

The ABC reported that she did realise the men she tried to hire were undercover police.

At an earlier court hearing, Brundritt lost a bid to have her name suppressed on the basis it would cause extreme distress for the couple's three young children.

The mother was arrested and charged with two counts of soliciting, persuading or proposing to murder in January.

Brundritt was remanded in custody and the matter has been adjourned for July 28.
