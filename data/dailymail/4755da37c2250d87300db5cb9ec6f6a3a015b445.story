The chief financial officer of Donald Sterling's properties says the billionaire may be forced to sell a large portion of his real estate empire to cover $500 million in loans if he persists in refusing to sell the Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion.

Darren Schield, who oversees the finances of The Sterling Family Trust, testified Monday that three banks are ready to recall their loans to Sterling because of his decision to dissolve the trust.

His move was designed to rescind agreement for the sale of the Clippers, a team he bought for $12 million.

Schield said if Sterling has to dump $500 million worth of apartment buildings he could destabilize the Los Angeles real estate market.

'We would have to start selling our real estate,' Schield said in Los Angeles Superior Court, adding that Sterling owns about $2.5 billion in property. 'We'd have no choice.'

Schield was called to testify by lawyers for Sterling's wife, Shelly Sterling, who has asked a probate court to confirm her as having the authority to sell the Clippers to former Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer.

Schield is a witness to Shelly Sterling's claim the deal must be completed even against her husband's wishes so debt can be paid off.

Schield testified that he warned Sterling against revoking the family trust that owns the Clippers and other holdings as a maneuver to block the sale because it would allow banks to call its loans.

'I told him this revocation would open up Pandora's Box and there would be severe consequences for us,' Schield said.

Sterling's lawyer suggested there are other options for raising the money.

Under cross-examination by Sterling's attorney Maxwell Blecher, Schield said that if Bank of America would foreclose, no other big banks would lend to the company and its current below-market interest rate would likely go up.

Schield also cast doubt on Blecher's 
suggestion that Sterling could raise enough cash to pay back the loans 
by issuing public stock.

'There's huge reputational issues,' Schield said. 'I don't think anyone would want to go into partnership with us right now.'

Bank
 of America Corp told Sterling's company it plans to issue a notice of 
default on the $350 million Sterling owes the lender after he moved last
 month to revoke trust, said Adam Streisand, the attorney for Ballmer.

Sterling, the volatile owner of the 
team, agreed to the sale but then tried to revoke consent in spite of a 
signed letter instructing his wife Shelly Sterling to sell for the 
highest price she could get.

A
 probate trial to resolve the matter has been underway since last month 
but was in recess for a week. With three days of hearings ahead, Donald 
Sterling's lawyers suggested they would call the battling couple back to
 the witness stand separately to address unanswered questions.

Superior
 Court Judge Michael Levanas was ambivalent about the need for more 
testimony from the pair but said he would permit it only if lawyers show
 that they are raising matters not covered during lengthy testimony by 
both Sterlings.

'This is a case that has many unusual 
twists and turns,' said the judge, noting that Donald Sterling's lawyers
 had suddenly come up with 'witnesses we've never heard of.'

Deal: Former Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer has made a record bid to buy the Clippers

The
 judge firmly refused to allow Sterling's lawyers to call opposing 
counsel to testify. He also rejected a bid to strike the testimony and 
reports of two doctors who found the 80-year-old has Alzheimer's disease
 and is incapable of acting as administrator of the family trust that 
owned the Clippers.

The 
judge's rulings Friday shortened the list of witnesses planned by 
Sterling's lawyers and both sides were juggling schedules of other 
witnesses.

The lawyer 
for the man who wants to buy the Clippers, former Microsoft CEO Steve 
Ballmer, stressed that time is running out on the contractual deadline 
for the sale which was supposed to be completed by Aug. 15. Attorney 
Adam Streisand urged the judge to make a quick decision once testimony 
ends, anticipating lengthy appeals if Shelly Sterling wins.

If the sale doesn't go through by Sept. 15, the NBA can seize the team and sell it at auction, Streisand said.

Donald
 Sterling has vowed he'll never sell the team and is suing to block his 
wife's single-handed deal to do so after the NBA banned him for life for
 making racist statements. He has denied he is a racist from the witness
 stand and claims he is the victim of illegally recorded conversations 
that invaded his privacy.

Outside court, Streisand said Donald Sterling's refusal to sell the team is 'a suicide mission by a madman.'

Attorney
 Bert Fields, who cross-examined Sterling, said he revealed himself as 
'a mean, nasty man who doesn't give a damn about his own family. For his
 ego, he's willing to give up benefits to his children and grandchildren
 from this sale.'

Outside
 court, Donald Sterling's lawyer, Bobby Samini, echoed his client's 
wishes. 'We're going to do everything in our power to stop the team from
 being sold,' he said.

'It's
 not about his ego,' Samini said. 'He's made it clear he believes his 
privacy rights were violated and what the league did wasn't legal.'
