A luxury apartment where Harrods once prepared and wrapped their Easter eggs has gone on the market for £5.35 million.

The two-bedroom flat is based within the 19th century Harrods Depository building at Trevor Square- now regarded as one of the most prestigious addresses in Knightsbridge, London.

It would have housed some of London's finest products such as chocolate, wine and clothing, which could not be kept in the store due to lack of space, while staff would use the centre for packaging luxury goods.

And twelve years ago, the depository was transformed into one of London's most exclusive block of flats. 

Located on the second floor, the flat has a large reception room with separate kitchen and breakfast area, featuring the latest technology including comfort cooling and a Creston home automation system. The address also features two bedrooms with a generous ensuite bathroom.

It is moments away from Hyde Park and Sloane Street and offers a clue to unusual history though its art deco architecture which is reminiscent of the Harrods department store itself located just across the road.

The sought-after address was once used to house a range of Harrods products which could not be kept in the store due to a lack of space

Located near Hyde Park and Sloane Street, the former Harrods depository also boasts a well-maintained communal area with benches and decking

The flat has 1,592 sq/ft of accommodation and has been put up for sale for £5.35 million - which means a waste paper bin takes up £3,360 of space.

It is around 30 times more expensive than the £180,000 paid for the average home last month, with stamp duty alone likely to set back the buyer £555,750. Only a small number of two-bedroom apartments attract a more expensive price-tag.

Shirley Humphrey, director at Harrods Estates, said: 'Trevor Square is a highly desirable residential address and this is a rare opportunity to own a home here.

'The former depository has such a fascinating history which purchasers love. The building was used as a storage and packaging center for some of London's finest goods including wine, chocolate and clothing.

'Today, Trevor Square features beautiful art deco communal spaces, which were transformed with a £1 million refurbishment and large lateral apartments which are ideal for the discerning purchaser who want to be in the hub of prime central London and just across the road from the famous Harrods store.'

The apartment is serviced by Harrods Estate Asset Management and includes 24 hour security, car parking and concierge services, which enable residents to have their fridge fully stocked, tickets to a London show arranged or simply have their post taken care of.
