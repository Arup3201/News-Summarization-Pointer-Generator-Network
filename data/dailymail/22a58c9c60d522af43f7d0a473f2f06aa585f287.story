From designing the Team GB Olympic kit to scooping two major awards at the British Fashion Awards, it has been a great year for Stella McCartney.

So it comes as no surprise that the British designer's contributions to fashion have been recognised with an OBE in the New Year's Honours List.

The designer daughter of Sir Paul McCartney was one of the 71 names to be honoured with an award in the Queen's prestigious list.

The 41-year-old's latest achievement is the perfect conclusion to a very successful year for the designer.

Not only did the mother-of-three work with sportswear brand Adidas to create the stylish and practical kits for the Team GB athletes, she also took home Designer Brand and Designer of the Year at the 2012 British Fashion Awards earlier this month.

Stella's fans include a roll call of almost every A-lister and fashionista in the business, from Kate Moss to the Duchess of Cambridge via Victoria Pendleton and Gwyneth Paltrow.

Other names featured on the Queen's New Year Honours List were artist Tracey Emin and fashion commentator Caryn Franklin. A special honours list was created to celebrate the impressive achievements of British Olympians.
