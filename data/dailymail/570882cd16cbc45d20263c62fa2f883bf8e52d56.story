A 16-month-old girl was shot dead by her 2-year-old brother in their Memphis home on Tuesday.

Calvuna Reese was killed on Tuesday when her brother allegedly accidentally pulled the trigger of a loaded gun.

The girl's father confirmed the shooting to neighbors, but the case is still under investigation by police.

Scene: 16-month-old Calvuna Reese was shot dead inside this Memphis apartment building by her 2-year-old brother on Tuesday

'Oh it tears me up. It really really hurts,' neighbor Randy Lark told local station WMCTV.

'I'm so shocked and hurt by what happened to this child.'

'She was real sweet, she was obedient.'

The tragedy has left many unanswered questions, but Mr Lark feels there is at least one lesson to come out of it.

Upset: Neighbor Randy Lark said that Calvuna was an 'active' and 'obedient' baby

'Everyone should learn from that lesson, not to leave a loaded gun around a kid,' he said.

This shooting comes just two days after a similar incident in Kentucky.

Bella San Martin, 15-months-old, was shot dead by her 3-year-old brother in their family's Hardin County home on Sunday.

Police involved in the Kentucky say it was a tragic accident and that the parents were home at the time.

Attending the scene: The police investigation continued into Sunday evening

Officer Bryce Shumate told WDRB News: ‘It appears the three-year-old sibling had gotten a pistol from somewhere in the home, was playing with it, and in playing with it, it discharged a single round.’

He added that when they arrived at the scene, officers and the fire department immediately started CPR.

However the child was pronounced dead at the home.

Neighbours have reported that Mr San Martin is in the military and is stationed at nearby Fort Knox.

The names of both boys involved in the two shootings have not been released due to their minor status.
