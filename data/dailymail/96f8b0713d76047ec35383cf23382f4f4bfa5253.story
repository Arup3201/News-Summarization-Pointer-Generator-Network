A 19-year-old woman who was victim of a horror smash where she became trapped in a flaming car has made a miraculous recovery.

Psychology student Danica Pringle, from the Melbourne suburb of Cranbourne, was hospitalised for over three months and left in an induced coma for weeks following what police believe to be a street racing accident on June 5.

Two of Ms Pringle's friends, who were behind the wheel also faced court on Tuesday charged over the crash.

Ms Pringle was left in a critical condition after the car she was in collided with a concrete pole and burst into flames on Thursday night in Melbourne's southeast

The 19-year-old was in the passenger side of a silver Ford Falcon (pictured) which is believed to have been involved in a drag race at the time of the incident

Despite being expected to die, after suffering significant burns to her body and going blind in one eye, the teenager has walked from hospital and spoken about the night that has changed her life forever.

'I've never really felt like I've had anything to overcome, I still feel really normal, I guess we could call that my fighting spirit,' she told the Herald Sun.

'I just really learnt to laugh and see the brighter side of things. The only thing I have trouble with is knowing what my friends will face for a silly mistake.'

Ms Pringle, who is unable to remember the crash, was sitting in the passenger side of a silver Ford Falcon which was seen speeding down the South Gippsland Highway alongside a blue Holden Commodore, before it smashed into a pole and burst into flames.

The driver of the Ford, Ms Pringle's friend, Brodie James McGregor,18, from Lynbrook, lost control of his vehicle at about 11:30pm before smashing into his friend's car which was driving beside him, veering the two vehicles off of the road and finally colliding with a concrete pole.

Police believe the driver of the Ford, which was travelling in the inside lane, lost control of his vehicle and hit the commodore.

'Both cars ran off the road way, mounted the centre median strip and collided with a concrete pole.' said senior constable Adam West.

Both drivers, Brodie James McGregor and another one of Ms Pringle's friends, Adam Phillip West, have been charged over the crash, which police believe was caused by street racing.

But Ms Pringle, who isn't able to speak to both boys due to bail conditions preventing them, says she will support both boys in court.

'There wasn't a second I was with those boys and believed they were being unsafe behind the wheel,' she said to the Herald Sun.

'I just want people to know that it wasn’t a case of forgiveness for me, these people are and always will be in my heart no matter what.'

After the crash happened, Ms Pringle remained trapped in the car from which she could hear screaming.

Neighbours who heard the crash, soon attempted to aid the group of friends by throwing water onto the flaming vehicle, however the 19 year old remained trapped until emergency services arrived to free her.

Once removed she was flown to the Melbourne's Alfred Hospital where she continued to fight for her life.

The passenger in the Holden Commodore which was also involved in the race (pictured) was also rushed to hospital with serious abdominal injuries

The drivers of the cars were both taken to hospital however they only suffered minor injuries

Ambulance Victoria spokesman Paul Bentley told the Sun Herald, paramedics arrived at the scene within four minutes where they found both cars in flames.

'The CFA managed to put out the fire pretty quickly but she was trapped for about half-hour,' he said.

The two drivers suffered minor injuries, while 19 year old passenger, Sam Newman was also injured in the crash.

Detective Acting Sergeant Ben Howie told radio 3AW at the time, it was amazing that no one was killed in the crash.

'It's staggering that someone has survived, or anyone has survived this ... You've essentially got one vehicle on top of the other,' he said.

Police are still investigating the incident and are encouraging anyone who may have witnessed the incident or who has any information, to come forward

Ms Pringle has thanked family and friends and medical staff for helping her pull through and plans to use her degree as a psychology student, which she plans to finish in the future, to counsel people who have been through similar accidents.

But before she does that, there will be a long road to recovery which will include rehabilitation to get things back to normal.

'I’m weaker but I feel like everything’s slowly going back to normal, some of these things will heal and we won't know how much until we can see it first-hand.,' she told the Herald Sun.

'I don't have the freedom I did, I can't go wherever I want whenever I want.'
