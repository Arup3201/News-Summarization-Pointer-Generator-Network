Rebels in Mali besieged the ancient city of Timbuktu today – the last major government holdout in the country.

The separatist Tuareg rebels entered the city yesterday after a rapid advance across the country, in an increasingly bloody fight to secure a homeland.

Residents of Timbuktu said they heard gunfire and explosions as fighters approached. They have been largely left to fend for themselves as troops from the government fled.

The Tuaregs are a nomadic Islamic people who want to establish a separate state.

Many of them are heavily armed, with weapons they have retained from fighting in Libya’s civil war last year.

Tuaregs are taking advantage of the chaos surrounding last week’s coup in Mali, west Africa, in which middle-ranking officers in Mali’s army ousted the president Amadou Toure.

Tuaregs have already seized other big cities in the north. If Timbuktu now falls, they will control most of Mali’s Sahara desert region.

Residents fleeing their advance said rebels had demanded all pictures of unveiled women be removed from public view.

Timbuktu, a former famous trading centre, and famous for being an Islamic scholar centre and much of the city is on the World Heritage List.

Nowadays though Timbuktu, which has a population of over 50,000, has fallen on hard times and is greatly impoverished.

The attack came a day after the rebels - a loose alliance of separatist nomad Tuaregs and local Islamists - seized the town of Kidal which, along with Gao and the historic trading city of Timbuktu, is one of three main regional centres of Mali's north.

'I saw them (the rebels) entering the town itself and putting up their Azawad flags,' a Reuters reporter said, referring to the desert territory which is bigger than France that the rebels want to make their homeland.               

'You can hear heavy weapons fire across the town,' the reporter added, saying the rebels had set up base in a captured fire station on its outskirts, which later came under attack from army helicopters and heavy weapons.             

Some rebel units were shouting 'God is Great' in Arabic, he said, suggesting they were linked to Islamist groups who do not have separatist goals but instead want to impose shariah law on the mostly Muslim country.

The unrest in Africa's third largest gold-producer has been fuelled by weapons brought out of Libya during last year's conflict, and risks creating a vast new lawless zone in the Saharan desert that Islamist and criminal groups could exploit.               

Mid-ranking officers behind last week's coup accused the government of giving them inadequate resources to fight the rebels. But the coup has turned into a spectacular own-goal, emboldening the rebels to take further ground.      

Advances by the Tuareg-led rebels, who have joined forces with Islamist allies, are likely to increase Western concerns about growing insecurity in West Africa.   

'If you have a successful Islamist revolt in northern Mali, people will sit up and take notice,' John Campbell, the Ralph Bunche Senior Fellow for Africa Policy Studies at the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations, said this week.

Malian President Amadou Toumani Toure, whose decade-long rule was associated with stability and rising frustration with a political elite accused of turning a blind eye to widespread corruption, has said he is safe in an undisclosed location in Mali.
