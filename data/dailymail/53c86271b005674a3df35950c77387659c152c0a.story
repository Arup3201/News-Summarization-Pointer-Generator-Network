The FBI is apparently closer to answering how a groom fell overboard on his honeymoon cruise seven years ago after discovering new footage from on board the ship.

George Smith, 26, vanished from the Royal Caribbean ship, Brilliance of the Seas, in the middle of the night on July 5, 2005. He had been partying into the early hours with his 25-year-old wife Jennifer Hagel-Smith and new friends.

The investigation into the death of Mr Smith, from Connecticut, has remained open and authorities have an incriminating video tape in their possession which may lead to an arrest.

Unsolved: George Smith, 26, vanished from a Royal Caribbean ship in the middle of the night on July 5, 2005 after partying into the small hours with his wife Jennifer Hagel-Smith

According to Cristin Marandino from Greenwich Magazine: 'On that videotape there are certain individuals that make very self-incriminating statements following the death of George Smith.

'This is a videotape that the gentlemen made of themselves. And in their room, sort of passing around a flip phone.'

On the evening of July 4, 2005, the newlyweds had been drinking at a disco on board. Exact details have remained unclear but it was believed that during the night, the couple became separated.

After Mrs Smith went to bed, her husband was believed to have fallen into the Aegean sea, near the Turkish port of Kusadasi.

The couple had been together for three years when they married in 2005 in a clifftop ceremony in Newport, Rhode Island.

Mrs Smith, an elementary school teacher, and George, who had taken over his family's successful liquor store business, embarked on a romantic honeymoon cruise through the Mediterranean.

However after the Fourth of July, Mrs Hagel-Smith awoke to find that her husband was not in the couple's cabin.

She was not immediately worried, believing he may have fallen asleep in the care of new friends. 

According to a report by Greenwich Magazine this month, Mrs Smith had forgotten fighting with her husband at the disco, passing out in a hallway and being returned to her room by security guards. 

Later that morning, after a search for her husband on board, the ship's captain broke the news to the newlywed that he had probably fallen overboard. The 26-year-old's body has never been found.

At the time, a large stain which appeared to be bloody fingerprints on a railing was photographed by a 16-year-old guest. The mark on the metal lifeboat canopy was reportedly then washed away by staff. 

Another passenger, 21-year-old Josh Askin, who had spent the night drinking and gambling with the couple, was interviewed by Turkish police along with a distraught Mrs Smith.

Mr Askin's father, Dr Jerry Askin, managed to videotape the interview of his son and several other young men, including two Russian brothers Greg and Zach Rozenberg, according to CBS in 2006. 

The group of men, who had been among the last to see George Smith, explained that they had been drinking then escorted an inebriated Mr Smith to his room.

Mrs Hagel-Smith was under suspicion for a time by the FBI along with several others on the cruise ship. No one has ever been charged with a crime.

Mr Smith's family continue to believe that he was murdered. The Greenwich Magazine reported that  his relatives were relieved new developments had come to light in his disappearance.

Mrs Hagel-Smith remarried to financial analyst Jeff Agne in 2009 at the age of 29.

The Smith family and their former daughter-in-law grew apart after she reached a $1.1 million settlement with Royal Caribbean Cruises in 2007. She has said that while George may have been murdered, he also could have fallen to his death. 

The FBI were looking into transferring the case from Connecticut to New York, where it is believed potential suspects live.
