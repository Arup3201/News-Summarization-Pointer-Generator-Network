Google's chief executive has bowed to a landmark 'right to be forgotten' ruling and has today introduced a new form letting people apply to get themselves removed from search results.

The 
changes come after the European Court of Justice ruled people have the 
'right to be forgotten' - meaning Google searches linked to individuals 
can taken down if they tarnish their reputation.

But in his first interview since the decision, company co-founder Larry Page suggested authoritarian
 states around the world will see the changes as a green light to 
internet censorship.

Co-founder and CEO Larry Page has warned that a European court ruling on 'the right to be forgotten' will help corrupt governments around the world

In an interview with the Financial Times, he said: 'It will be used by other governments that aren't as forward and progressive as Europe to do bad things.

'Other people are going to pile on, probably... for reasons most Europeans would find negative.'

He also told of his fears that the ruling, seen as the biggest ever privacy setback for an online company, would discourage would-be internet entrepreneurs from setting up new businesses.

Google is launching the online form 
today to allow people to have links to information taken down from the website's search results.

The
 company will review the deluge of requests it is expected to receive, 
with some links expected to be taken down within weeks.

From today, Google's website will contain a form for users who want links to information about them removed

The 
ruling has been criticised after it emerged many of the 3,000-plus requests 
the company has already received were from corrupt public figures and 
criminals desperate to hide their past.

Google
 says it wants to strike a balance between people's right to privacy and
 maintaining links to information that is in the public interest.

A
 company spokesman said: 'In implementing this decision, we will assess 
each individual request and attempt to balance the privacy rights of the
 individual with the public's right to know and distribute information.'

People who want links about them taken down from Google will have to give the company the URL or web address of the offending webpage, their home country and an explanation of why they think the link should be removed.

Google insists 'humans, not algorithms' will make the decision after looking into the applicant's case.

The plans only extend to local or national sites, e.g. Google.co.uk, and searches in Google.com will still show the person's undesired results.

Cases where Google does not agree with the applicant will be passed on to national data protection agencies.

Searchers will then be notified if a link has been removed, although the original webpage will remain online.

Mr
 Page said the powerful and famous will still be scrutinised online, 
adding: 'I'm a public figure. There are lots of things that are written 
about me that I'm sure are untrue. I kind of deal with that.'

The
 original information about people will not be removed from the internet
 and will still exist on the relevant website, but web users will not 
see it in their Google searches or be able to link to it through the 
site.

Cases
 which Google refuses to act upon will be handed over to national data 
protection agencies, such as Britain's Information Commissioner's 
Office, which are braced for a flood of requests in coming months.

Germany, 
whose citizens have contributed 40 per cent of the requests to Google so
 far, is even considering bringing in a new division of courts to hear 
internet privacy disputes.

Concerns have been raised that the ruling could 
lead to censorship after it emerged that an actor who had an affair with a teenager, a celebrity's child who was convicted of criminal offices and a man who 
tried to kill members of his family were among the first requests 
received.

Around
 30 per cent of the requests Google has been sent so far concern fraud, 
12 per are related to paedophilia and 20 per cent concern reports of 
people's arrests or convictions.

The
 original case regarding the right to be forgotten was brought by a 
Spanish man who claimed his privacy had been infringed by an auction 
notice for his repossessed home.

Under
 Article 17 of the European Data Protection Regulation, internet users 
who are mentioned in data have the right to 'obtain from the controller 
the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from 
further dissemination of such data'.

Yahoo
 Inc which also operates a search engine in Europe, has previously said 
it is 'carefully reviewing' the decision to assess the impact for its 
business and its users.

Microsoft, which operates the Bing search engine, has previously declined to comment on the ruling.
