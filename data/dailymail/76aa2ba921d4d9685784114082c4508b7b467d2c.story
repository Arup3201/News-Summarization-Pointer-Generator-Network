Tearaway: Jennice Lynch, 19, had pleaded guilty to raiding her family home three times and was given a suspended sentence

A teenage tearaway whose parents begged for her to be locked up has been arrested for stealing a car from the family of a disabled girl.

Ruth and John Lynch were furious when a court failed to jail 19-year-old Jennice Lynch after years of trouble ended in her raiding the family home.

They said they were devastated by their daughter’s betrayal when she burgled their £300,000 house three times in a matter of weeks, stealing jewellery including a £4,000 gold watch.

She pleaded guilty at Burnley Crown Court in March to three burglaries in October and November last year but Recorder Kevin Talbot let her off with a 22-month suspended sentence.

Lynch, who was also banned from going within 200 metres of her parents’ home in Whitworth, Lancashire, claimed she had carried out one of the raids because her mother had ignored her and given her a ‘dirty look’.

At the time, Mrs Lynch, 45, and her company director husband, John, 46, called the punishment a ‘joke’ and said it would not deter Lynch, a single mother of two, from stealing again.

Six weeks later she is alleged to have broken into the home of Mike and Phillipa Christie in Bacup, Lancashire, and stolen the keys to their Fiat Punto Evo.

The specially adapted car is used to take their autistic six-year-old daughter Catherine to hospital appointments and after-school activities.

It was found abandoned and written off the following day.

Lynch, who is unemployed and lives off benefits, was arrested on Saturday on suspicion of theft and of breaching her two-year suspended sentence.

Mr Christie, 40, the director of a computer company, said the family have been left with no transport for their daughter and will have to raise thousands of pounds for a replacement.

He said: ‘The car was a lifeline for us and when we realised what had happened our hearts sank. We can’t take Catherine anywhere without it and it just feels utterly cruel.’

Crown Court: Lynch's parents had begged for her to have a custodial sentence, knowing a suspended one would 'not deter her'

Mrs Christie, 26, a web designer, said of Lynch: ‘Her own parents begged for her to be put behind bars and yet she was once again allowed back on the streets. If this girl has taken our disabled daughter’s car then she needs serious help or needs to be behind bars.

‘She has shown a pattern of serious criminal behaviour since she was 14 and for her to be let free to go on committing crimes is just ridiculous.’

Following her arrest, Lynch requested psychiatric help and is now in the mental health unit at Burnley General Hospital.

Previously, Mr and Mrs Lynch have spoken of the problems they have had with Lynch for most of her life and particularly since she was 14.

Mr Lynch said: ‘No matter how many times we tried to help her or get her help it has not worked – she has been a total nightmare.

‘We knew that this suspended sentence would not deter her and it is just crazy that she was able to go free.’
