He has made a career out of helping people spend huge sums of money on building their dream houses.

But Kevin McCloud has now said renting is the way forward and urged more Britons to consider being tenants rather than home-owners.

And the Grand Designs presenter, 55, has also admitted he ‘can’t stand’ some of the people who appear on the show and that many of the projects featured in the programme seem like the ‘dreams of psychopaths’.

Kevin McCloud has now said renting is the way forward and urged more Britons to consider being tenants rather than home-owners

The father-of-two – who lives in an Elizabethan farmhouse near Burton with his wife Suzanna, 52 – said the shortage of housing in Britain means it is not affordable for everyone to buy houses and that renting provides a solution.

He said: ‘The prices have peaks and then drop, but essentially property in the UK will always be of a premium because there’s not enough of it.

‘So that doesn’t work for a country that is one of the most populated in Europe. There is a tradition of social housing in other countries but we don’t have it

‘We are going to have to reconsider how we choose to live in terms of renting. There seems to be an allergy to that here and yet renting is a perfectly good idea.

‘I rented for years and I loved it — no responsibilities, no clearing of gutters. It left me free to actually enjoy my life.’

However, the presenter, who has fronted the Channel 4 programme since its launch in 1999, also said the Government’s plan to build 250,000 new homes a year will fail, claiming the properties will be too poor quality to attract buyers.

He told The Times: ‘It’s not to do with the amount, it’s to do with the quality. We have to build houses that people want to live in within communities that work for them and we have to ask the existing community what they think will work because they have more local knowledge than just about anyone else.

‘Until in this country we get the spaces between the buildings right, then every single housing scheme will fail.

‘The home is the heart of people’s lives. It is the launch pad of our lives and the sense of ownership goes beyond that. It stretches out into the park, the allotment, the car club.’

McCloud is no stranger to such construction projects himself. He has his own business, Happiness Architecture Beauty, which builds sustainable properties and last year completed a 42 home project in Swindon – including 50 percent social housing.

The presenter also revealed that while to viewers he may seem like a source of unwavering – if sometimes stern – support for the people appearing on Grand Designs, he has to work hard to hide his distaste for some of the couples and their planned homes.

Asked if he liked all of the projects he helps oversee, he said: ‘We all love the human side of it. Sometimes the projects are unbelievable. They almost seem as if they are dreams of psychopaths but they are not.

‘We all have our particular tastes. I will say that I admire them all. Admire is an under-used word.

‘I have worked with some people I can’t stand, but I am professional enough not to let that colour my judgment or some across on the show… As a presenter I can find the good in people. I can unlock them and build a rapport of trust.

‘On camera I am there to show the viewer the story in all its entirety. It’s not just about the property, it’s about the people, the hopes and dreams and the stresses and strains.’
