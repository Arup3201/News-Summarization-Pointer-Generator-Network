White House press secretary Jay Carney said he hadn't looked at his copy of 'Duty' by Robert Gates, but a staffer read the book overnight and sections were frantically distributed by morning inside the West Wing and elsewhere

The Obama administration was blindsided' by bombshell accusations in a book by former secretary of defense Robert Gates, according to a White House staffer with knowledge of Tuesday's events in the White House.

'They're breaking it down and dividing it up in the West Wing,' the aide told MailOnline, describing a frantic scene. 'No one saw this coming.'

The source requested anonymity since he is not authorized to speak publicly.

Jay Carney, the White House's press secretary, opened Wednesday's press briefing by asking reporters, 'Read any good books lately?'

He said he had received a copy of the book Tuesday night, a half-day after The Wall Street Journal published an excerpt online and portions were leaked to The Washington Post, The New York Times and other press outlets.

Carney downplayed the seismic event that gripped Washington on Tuesday, saying he hadn't read the book, titled, 'Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War.'

'I don’t know who else got a copy,' a coy Carney told reporters. "I got a copy. ... I haven’t had time to look at it yet.'

But National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden acknowledged to MailOnline that the book 'was read by a member of the White House staff overnight.'

She declined to name the staffer, and said she would not go 'into further detail about ... how it was distributed within the White House.'

Jay Carney faced a skeptical press corps on Wednesday, a half-day after receiving a copy of Gates' book -- which the White House acknowledged was devoured by a staffer overnight

Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has given Republicans something to wave around in 2016, with new revelations about President Obama's war rationale and Hillary Clinton's preference for politics over principle

She insisted that Carney 'was completely accurate in what he said at the podium' on Wednesday, emphasizing that 'Jay has not yet read the book, as he said.'

But the White House staffer who spoke to MailOnline said that 'by morning there were chapters floating around.'

In a separate conversation, he added that 'this is very, very bad. Jay is spinning everyone. But then, that's his job.'

Carney refused to directly defend President Obama on Wednesday against charges that he lost faith in his own strategy for the war in Afghanistan after he took office.

Now, however, 'the president has great faith in the troops that carried out the mission and in the mission itself,' Carney said.

The White House spokesman repeated a flattering portion of one quote from the book that appeared in the Post's review – without referring to the line's less-than-favorable conclusion.

Gates wrote that 'I never doubted Obama’s support for the troops, only his support for their mission.'

Carney cited only the first half of that sentence. 

Photojournalists were allowed a rare opportunity Wednesday to capture Barack Obama and Joe Biden together at lunch, in a move that Carney would not conceded was calculated to defend the vice president against Gates' attacks

Gates writes that Biden was 'wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades' -- but the White House rushed to the VP's defense

The former defense secretary wrote in 
his memoir, due out next week, that as Obama lost faith in Gen. David 
Petraeus' handling of hostilities in
 Afghanistan, he – Gates – lost faith in Obama's commitment to 
accomplishing much of anything.

Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates' memoirs will go on sale January 14, following a PR offensive that 'blindsided' the White House

'As
 I sat there,' he recalled, 'I thought: The president doesn’t trust his 
commander, can’t stand [President Hamid] Karzai, doesn’t believe in his 
own strategy and doesn’t consider the war to be his.'

'For him, it’s all about getting out.'

And of Obama's surge of 
30,000 troops in Afghanistan, Gates said the commander-in-chief was 'skeptical if not outright convinced it would fail.'

Carney insisted on Wednesday that Gates' recollections were evidence that the president welcomed a diversity of opinions among the consciously chosen 'team of rivals' that made up his war council.

Obama 'would not make a decision about surging U.S. troops without a thorough debate,' Carney insisted.

'When it comes to the interagency process,' he said, 'the president expects it to be robust, and he expects to hear competing points of view from every member of his national security team.'

But he stopped short of declaring that Gates was incorrect in his assessment, even when reporters pressed him.

The White House was quick on Tuesday night to defend Vice President Joe Biden against Gates' charge that he 'has been wrong 
on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over 
the past four decades.'

But while the administration's statement, delivered via the National Security Council, called Biden 'one of the leading statesmen of his time,' it didn't defend Obama directly.

Obama, shown during a 2010 trip to Afghanistan, doubted that his own troop surge in that country would meet with any success, Gates writes, but he ultimately decided to pull out of the country in order to help his re-election chances

Carney refused to concede Wednesday that a staged photo-op of the president and Biden sharing lunch was meant as a show of support for the vice president, who is among Democrats touted as potential presidential candidates in 2016.

News photographers were permitted to photograph the pair Wednesday, a rare occurrence in the Obama administration. The president’s schedule for the day includes five meetings where Biden will be present.

Carney described the photo call as a 'total coincidence.'

'You can decide for yourself what you want to believe.'

Carney also did not defend either President Obama or former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton against Gates' bombshell revelation that both placed political calculations ahead of military strategy when they opposed President George W. Bush's Iraq troop surge before the 2008 presidential election season kicked off.

Describing a 'remarkable' exchange he 
witnessed, Robert Gates writes in a book due out next week that 'Hillary
 told the president that her opposition to the [2007] surge in Iraq had 
been political because she was facing him in the Iowa primary.'

Obama,
 too, 'conceded vaguely that [his] opposition to the Iraq surge had been
 political,' Gates recounts. 'To hear the two of them making these 
admissions, and in front of me, was as surprising as it was dismaying.'

Hillary Clinton staked out her Iraq policy in late 2006 not on a military calculation, but based on how she could aid her soon-to-come presidential campaign, according to Gates' memoir

Gates ultimately concluded in his book that Obama was 'inexperienced' yet 'determined to change course – and equally determined from day one to win re-election.'

'Domestic political considerations would therefore be a factor,' he wrote, 'though I believe never a decisive one, in virtually every major national security problem we tackled.'

A publicist with Knopf Doubleday, 
which is publishing the memoir, told MailOnline that The Wall Street Journal paid 
for the rights to publish the excerpt from Gates' book on Tuesday, and hinted that more may be coming.

'Serial rights were sold to the Wall Street Journal,' Brittany Morrongiello emailed, 'and are in place through on-sale date of 1/14/14.'
