These artists took hanging round town in tracksuits to a new level - stunning shoppers and dog walkers in the Welsh city of Bangor.

Known as Bodies in Urban Spaces, the 
group infiltrated window archways, squeezed under park benches and piled
 onto the roofs of suburban homes.

The conceptual art group bends the rules of street performance and has already impressed city-dwellers in Paris, Vienna, Seoul, Montreal and New York.

That's one way to get to church: Street contortionists have been moulding themselves into unexpected spaces in Bangor, Wales, as part of the Bodies in Urban Spaces project by Austrian choreographer Willi Dorner

These teenagers in Bangor were baffled by the sight of the artists stacked like shopping baskets

Wearing garish bright tracksuits, they also posed on top of walls, on the side of houses and between electrical boxes.

Austrian artist Willi Dorner thought up the project in 2007 and it has been touring the world since.

It has already visited Loughborough, Swansea, Bristol and Margate, Kent.

The group's latest stop in Bangor saw them ushering audiences from site to site for the two-day event.

The artist said on his website: 'By placing the bodies in selected spots the interventions provoke a thinking process and produce irritation.

'Bodies in Urban Spaces invites the residents to walk their own city thus establishing a stronger relationship to their neighbourhood, district and town.

'The interventions are temporary without leaving any traces behind, but imprints in the eyewitnesses` memory.'

Photographer Ray Wood, who captured the street art in Swansea, said: 'Some of the positions were clearly very strenuous to hold. No sooner had the performers "unravelled" themselves, than they had to run on ahead to get into position at another site before the audience arrived.

'The audience was relatively small so everyone got a chance to have a good look and really have a chance to witness something amazing.

'At times it all looked a bit surreal but it definitely drew your attention to spaces that you'd never normally notice. It was also huge fun and often the audience's reaction or that of a passer-by was as interesting as the actual performance.'

Put on for free in the street and in parks, the performances put a new spin on internet crazes like planking
