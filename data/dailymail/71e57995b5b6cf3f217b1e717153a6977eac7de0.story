Study of excavations at the LaCotte de St Brelade site (pictured) has cleared Neanderthals of calculated murders

Did Neanderthal hunters drive mammoth herds over cliffs in brutal mass killings?

It’s a question that has been puzzling archaeologists since the 1960s following the discovery of heaped mammoth bones in Jersey.

But a new study of excavations at the La Cotte de St Brelade site now appears to have cleared Neanderthals of these calculated murders or mass hunts.

Researchers at the British Museum have found that the land that ends at the cliff edge was so rocky that mammoths would never have gone up there, according to a report in the Guardian. 

Successfully driving animals over the cliff would first require that they be present upon an elevated, rocky plateau,’ the researchers write in the journal Antiquity.

‘If such a herd was present, driving them over the cliff would then require forcing them over these natural barriers and up onto a fairly restricted space on the headland.

Heaps of mammoth bones found piled up at the foot of a cliff were initially thought to be the results of Neanderthals driving the creatures over the edge

‘This landscape would divide a herd and actively direct them away from the supposed death trap.’

The site was home to Neanderthals for around 200,000 years, but it is thought it was abandoned at time when the climate cooled, forcing Neanderthals into warmer areas.

To recreate the landscape that the Neanderthals lived, researchers looked at a survey of the seabed that stretches away from the cliff.

The land, now under water, would have been an ideal vantage point for Neanderthal hunters as it included ravines, gullies and valleys.

Even if the creatures had clambered so high, the Neanderthals would have had to move them through a dip at Jersey's La Cotte de St Brelade site. The dip is in the top image. The bottom image shows the site as it is today

Jersey is believed to be one of the last places the Neanderthals lived after teeth were discovered on its Cotte de St Brelade cave in 1910

‘It offered Neanderthals a landscape in which large mammals could be both effectively controlled and ambushed,’ the researchers write.

Older sediments at the site have large amounts of burnt bone and charcoal, suggesting that the bones collected and used as fuel.

The research team believes the Neanderthals could also have carried the bones there after hunts and used them for building shelters and food.

Jersey is believed to be one of the last places the Neanderthals lived after teeth were discovered on its Cotte de St Brelade cave in 1910.

The cave has so far produced more Neanderthal stone tools than the rest of the British Isles put together.

Findings bring the collections of stone tools, animal bone and Neanderthal remains under renewed study

Evidence has been uncovered that Jersey may have been home to one of the last Neanderthals.

British archaeologists have now found that a large portion of Cotte de St Brelade contains sediment dating to the last Ice Age, preserving 250,000 years of climate change and archaeological evidence.

‘In terms of the volume of sediment, archaeological richness and depth of time, there is nothing else like it known in the British Isles,’ said Dr Matt Pope of the Institute of Archaeology at University College London, who helped lead the research.

‘Given that we thought these deposits had been removed entirely by previous researchers, finding that so much still remains is as exciting as discovering a new site.’

The team dated sediments at the site using a technique called Optically Stimulated Luminesce, which measures the last time sand grains were exposed to sunlight.

The results showed that part of the sequence of sediments dates between 100,000 and 47,000 years old, indicating that Neanderthal teeth which were discovered at the site in 1910 were younger than previously thought.

According to the researchers, they probably belonged to one of the last Neanderthals to live in the region.

‘The discovery that these deposits still exist and can be related to previously excavated deposits opens up a range of exciting possibilities,’ said Dr Martin Bates, University of Trinity St Davids, who is leading current fieldwork at the site.

Instead of mass murders, heap of bones could be explained if Neanderthals piled them together to build shelters and used them for heat and food
