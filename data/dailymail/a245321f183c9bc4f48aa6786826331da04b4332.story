Nong Kaem, 13, was raped and murdered on an overnight train in Thailand

A 13-year-old girl was raped and murdered on an overnight train in Thailand before her body was shoved on to the tracks.

Nong Kaem went missing on Saturday night as she slept during a return journey with her sisters from the southern province of Surat
 Thani to the capital, Bangkok.

Her body was discovered three days later near the train tracks in Prachuap Khirikhan 
province's Pranburi district according to police.

The route is popular among backpackers traveling back from Thailand's island and beach resort destinations.

'She wanted to be an angel, she wanted to be an air hostess,' Nong's mother said today.

'If she was still here I would do everything to support her, but now I have nothing left.'

Her sister wrote on Facebook: 'Kaem, I am so sorry that I failed to look after you. I am a terrible sister. Please forgive me,' she wrote, according to the Bangkok Post.

Police have charged a 22-year-old train cleaner with rape and murder.

A police spokesman said in a televised statement Wanchai Saengkhao had confessed to taking drugs before committing the crimes and throwing the girl's body out of the train.

Today he was taken back to Wangpong train station where the same train Nong Kaem travelled on was stopped for a re-enactment.

He told police he had been drinking with other employees when he left them and switched off the light in the car before he climbed into the girl's bed.

Saengkhao said he strangled her until she passed out and raped her.

He said that she regained consciousness during the horrific attack, but he strangled her again.

He took her iPhone and iPad before pushing her body out of the train window.

He told police he then took her her bag and sat in the train until it arrived in Bangkok.

Saengkhao confessed to the crime after he was tracked down via his victim's mobile phone.

Wanchai sold the girl's phone to a shop owner in Bangkok, who took a copy of his I.D. which was later passed to police.

He faces charges of rape, concealing a body and murder, which carries the death penalty. 

He also allegedly confessed to raping two other women reported the website. 

On Instagram, Thai entertainment stars and celebrities joined the chorus of calls for the law to be changed to make rape punishable only by death.

Convicted rapists now face a sentence of four to 20 years in prison and a fine.

Nonthawan 'Maeya' Thongleng, the recently-crowned Miss Thailand World 2014, displayed a poster on Instagram calling for a change in the law and commented: 'I've always thought of this. I want it changed already. Be more strict, please.'

A petition on the online social movement website Change.org that called on Thailand's military leader to make such a legal change attracted nearly 15,000 signatures within one day.

Thailand's army ousted an elected civilian government in May.

'The offenders, once arrested and sentenced, usually get pardoned and released from jail.

And when they get out, they commit the crime again and again to the point that judicial power in Thailand is no longer sacred,' the petition read.

Col. Winthai Suvaree, a spokesman for the ruling junta, said its leader, Army Commander Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, urged the authorities to quickly prosecute the perpetrator and called on the relevant agencies to seek extra safety measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring.

'We must call a meeting with every side involved and will have to revise our recruitment process,' State Railway of Thailand governor Prapas Chongsa-nguan told The Associated Press.
