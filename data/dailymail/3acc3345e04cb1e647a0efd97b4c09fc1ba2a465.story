Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois is expected to start for Belgium against Andorra – just five days after suffering a head injury against Arsenal.

The 22-year-old stopper joined up with his international team-mates on Thursday – three days later than the rest of the squad – after he was substituted following a clash with Alexis Sanchez on Sunday.

And after coming through a Thursday night training session unscathed he will start in Brussels, subject to further neurological tests on Friday.

Chelsea allowed their new No 1 to answer his country’s call after he was passed medically fit, but reports in Belgium suggest they would prefer for him to be rested with Courtois still suffering from a minor headache.

The young keeper had already claimed to be feeling better and is now expected to start against Andorra, although Liverpool’s Simon Mignolet will deputise if there are problems with tests on Friday.

Belgium manager Marc Wilmots told his Thursday press conference: ‘I do not understand the discussion on Courtois.

‘If he is fit and wants to play, he will. If not, then it will be Mignolet. I will decide after training.’

Courtois took part in some light exercises at Chelsea’s Cobham training base this week and is keen to add to his 22 international caps.

Even if they do hold concerns over the young ‘keeper’s condition, Chelsea are unable to prevent Wilmots from selecting him for Friday’s Euro 2016 Group B qualifying clash – or Monday’s trip to face Bosnia-Herzegovina.
