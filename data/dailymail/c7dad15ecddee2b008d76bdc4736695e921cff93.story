Anyone in Texas knows you must always remember the Alamo. It would also be advised that you always remember to delete the nude photos you took of yourself and then sent to a man who isn't your husband - just ask Melinda Navarro, the Executive Administrator at the Alamo Mission in San Antonio. 

Navarro currently is engaged in a bitter divorce with her soon-to-be ex-husband, Larry Navarro, who is taking bitter to some rather staggering levels.

After discovering nude photos his wife had taken of herself and then sent to another man, Mr. Navarro reportedly went ahead and forwarded the images to his wife's friends, work colleagues, her parents and even the couple's 16-year-old daughter.

The existence of the photos was revealed in divorce proceedings earlier this week when Mr. Navarro filed a motion to examine a laptop computer and to hear testimony from the man he believes received the risque photos - as well as sexually charged text messages - from his wife. 

As a public employee making $85,000 a year, Ms. Navarro has admitted to sending the photos and texts via-a cell phone used for both personal and Alamo business, according to the San Antonio Express-News. However, she denies ever having an affair.

In a 39-page child custody investigation report for the couple's two teenage children - first published by a Texas blogger - the author notes that 'Ms. Navarro stated that around her anniversary last year there had been an argument... and Larry had taken her phone, found some texts and photos that she had sent to a man, and forwarded a number of the personal photos to her parents, daughter, co-workers, and social circle.'

The report goes on to say that 'she stated that her co-workers were obviously uncomfortable the next day and finally a man showed her a nude photo with the caption, "Look what het (sic) Alamo is paying for!" When she learned of Navarro's action, she separated from him on September 17, 2012, and filed for divorce two days later.'

Remember: the Battle of the Alamo is considered the turning point of the Texas Revolution and has become one of the state's most recognizable landmarks

Ms. Navarro's sexting is just the latest black-eye for the Alamo - and the organization of women that has been tasked with maintaining it for the last 108 years.

Ms. Navarro is a member of the Daughters of the Republic of Texas, a group of Texas women that - until recently - has been in charge of overseeing several Texas landmarks, including the Alamo, the Shrine of Texas Freedom and the French Legation Embassy.

The group has become controversial in recent years and has garnered a slue of bad press - so bad, in fact, that the Texas Legislature stripped it of its duties of maintaining the historic landmark last year - a duty with which it has been entrusted since 1905.

But group still maintains the Alamo - it does so, however, as state contractor under the Texas General Land Office, which appoints an executive administrator.

Navarro fell into her current position after the appointed executive administrator resigned last year after just five months on the job and was never replaced.

The Daughters of the Republic of Texas' contract with the state ends this month, but that hasn't stopped several people - including state legislators and members if the Daughters of the Republic of Texas - from calling on Navarro to resign.

Navarro is paid $85,000 a year in taxpayer money to run the Alamo

'I
 have repeatedly asked for a strong state presence at the Alamo, and 
this new information does not add confidence to the management,” Texas state Senator Leticia Van de 
Putte told the San Antonio Express-News.

Former DRT member Sarah Reveley, who was booted from the group after complaining to the Texas Attorney General's Office about how poorly the group was taking care of the Alamo, thinks it's time for Navarro to go.

“Divorces should be private 
business, but her key $85,000-a-year position at the Alamo makes her a 
public figure,” Reveley posted on her Facebook page.
