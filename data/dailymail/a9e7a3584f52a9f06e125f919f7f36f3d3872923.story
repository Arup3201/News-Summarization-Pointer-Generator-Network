He's famous for his wit and dry sense of humour - and he clearly hasn't lost any of it.

The 91-year-old Duke of Edinburgh left a policeman chuckling yesterday as he walked to church in Sandringham, Norfolk.

No-one was near enough to hear what he said, but Prince Philip appeared to be back to his playful best after having suffered bout of illness last year.

The Duke braved the wind and rain to walk 400 yards to St Mary Magdalene church from Sandringham House with an equerry while the Queen, 86, went by car.

Playful: The Duke of Edinburgh attended a Sunday morning church service at Sandringham Church, Norfolk, yesterday and walked past this policeman

She decided to break with Royal tradition by extending her winter break, it was revealed yesterday.

The monarch normally returns to London every year within a day or so of Ascension Day on February 6, the anniversary of her taking over the throne on the death of her father.

But this year the Queen has decided to continue her stay on her 20,000-acre estate in north Norfolk for a few more days.

The Queen, who was wearing a white coat and accompanied by a lady in waiting, was cheered by a crowd of around 50 well-wishers as she arrived in her state Bentley.

She collected flowers from around half a dozen children after the 40 minute service.

An onlooker said: 'It was a real surprise to see the Queen. Normally she returns to London alone and leaves Prince Philip at Sandringham so he can continue to enjoy the shooting up here.

'But this year she has stayed on with him. It is unusual because she is normally a stickler for routine.'

While the pheasant shooting season ends on February 1, the prince still enjoys going out shooting hares with his friends.

It is believed that he went out on a hare shoot on Saturday.

A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said: 'There is no particular reason for the Queen choosing to stay up at Sandringham.

'She has had some engagements in Norfolk. It is just the way the diary has fallen. She is back with a full programme of events this week.'

The Queen normally spends Ascension Day quietly at Sandringham where her father King George VI died in 1952.
