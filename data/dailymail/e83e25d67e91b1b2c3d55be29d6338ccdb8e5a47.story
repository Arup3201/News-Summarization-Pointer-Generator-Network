In hindsight, it probably wasn’t worth it for a milkshake.

When a brazen shoplifter skulked into a post office in Edinburgh, he assumed it would be easy to pocket a couple of drinks.

But behind the counter was Arfan Hussain - grocer, sub-postmaster... and former Tae Kwon Do champion.

Mr Hussain, who has a second degree black-belt in the Korean combat style, has now become an internet hit after posting CCTV footage of himself wrestling with the thief on YouTube.

No nonsense: Shopkeeper and martial arts expert Arfan Hussain tackled a shoplifter in his store in Edinburgh

In the clip the 30-year-old shopkeeper is seen taking down the teen after he tried to leave the shop with two milkshakes worth £2.30.

Mr Hussain’s 51-year-old father, Riaz, can also be seen joining the fray in the Costless Express store, which houses Muirhouse Post Office.

The shopkeeper has now been hailed the internet’s next ‘Big Man’, with his clip already having gained 1,500 hits since the incident on Monday.

The famous ‘Big Man’ YouTube hit, which racked up two million views, sparked massive debate after banker Allan Pollock was seen throwing Sam Main off a train, taking matters into his own hands after the student allegedly refused to pay his fare.

Mr Hussain said he hoped his film would prove a deterrent to shoplifters visiting the store.

The shopkeeper and his family have been in business for 21 years and he claims the thief had been barred after he was spotted stealing ‘three or four times’.

Mr Hussain added: ‘He came back and stole two more shakes. I approached him as he went for the door and he took a swing at me.

‘I’m a second degree black-belt in Tae Kwon Do, so I know how to control that kind of situation and do it without hurting someone. I grabbed him and threw him down.’

In January last year, Mr Hussain was held up at gunpoint by 18-year-old Craig Vallance, who threatened ‘I’ll blow your brains out’. The gun was later revealed to be replica rifle and Vallance was jailed for five years and four months.

Mr Hussain has been more cautious since the ordeal, and so when the shoplifter struck on Saturday, he was ready to stamp out any potential threat.

He said: ‘He was shouting and swearing and then he started going for his pockets. I didn’t know if he was going to pull a needle or a knife and, after what happened last year, I didn’t want to take a chance.’

Mr Hussain said he deals with around three shoplifters a week, most of whom surrender without incident.

He added: ‘The police said I should’ve let him leave the store first, but Scots law is on my side as he went past the counter and touched the door.

‘It was my friend who suggested I put the CCTV on YouTube, but I had no idea it would get so many hits.’

However, one rival shopkeeper, who asked not to be named, criticised Mr Hussain, saying: ‘This was clearly unreasonable force. It was totally disgusting and unacceptable. The shopkeeper should be charged with assault.’

A Lothian and Borders Police spokeswoman said: ‘A 17-year-old boy has been charged in connection with this incident and is due to appear at court at a later date.’
