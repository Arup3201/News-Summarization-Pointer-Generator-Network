Anyone twice caught carrying on a knife will be automatically jailed, under tough new laws passed by MPs tonight.

Tory and Labour backbenchers joined forces to see off an attempt by the Lib Dems to block the measure after Nick Clegg claimed it would see gangs forcing innocent victims to carry knives on their behalf.

Mr Clegg's veto  meant Conservative ministers were unable to support the proposal. But it was passed after Tory backbench MP Nick De Bois tabled the measure anyway - with the tacit backing of David Cameron.

Knife thugs will be automatically jailed the second time they are caught carrying a blade after Labour MPs backed the Tory proposal in the face of Lib Dem opposition

With Labour support the automatic jail rule passed the Commons by 404 votes to 53.

Mr De Bois said the automatic jail sentence would send a clear signal to violent criminals.

He said: 'Some have argued that sending a signal may not be enough, that potential offenders do not think of the consequences of pocketing a knife. 

'Quite simply, in the vast majority of cases, let's face it, to kill someone with a knife you first have to carry a knife, and I believe our courts are dispensing sentences for possession of a knife in thousands of cases that are quite simply treated by offenders as little more than an occupational hazard.

Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said the tough new rules were only introduced because of Labour support

'With nearly 8,000 last year being fines and cautions, I would suggest that in some cases that fuels knife crime and does nothing to halt knife crime.'

Under the proposals, adults would receive a minimum six-month jail term on their second conviction for carrying a knife, while 16-year-olds would be given at least a four-month detaining and training order.

Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan welcomed the ruling.

He said: 'In opposition David Cameron promised that everyone caught carrying a knife would go to jail. 

'After four years as Prime Minister and four years of broken promises, it’s not surprising that David Cameron and his ministers failed to support these measures. They have only been passed because of Labour support. 

'We must send out a strong message that knife crime is unacceptable.

'Now, someone caught, charged, prosecuted and found guilty of carrying a knife for a second time will almost certainly be sent to prison unless there are particular reasons why they shouldn’t be. 

'There will still be judicial discretion, but the message is clear, those who repeatedly commit knife crime face prison. 

'We don’t believe this in itself is enough to rid our streets of the scourge of knives, which is why its important work is done with families, schools, colleges and youth clubs to prevent people carrying a knife in the first place.'
