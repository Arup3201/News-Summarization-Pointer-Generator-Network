Neymar has been gearing up for a pivotal week in Barcelona’s pursuit of a treble by taking a tiny bicycle for a spin.

The Brazilian star is clearly in a relaxed mood before Barcelona take on Manchester City and play out the El Classico next week.

Neymar, who believes Luis Enrique’s side can achieve a treble this season, will hope to help keep Barcelona top of La Liga with victory at Eibar on Saturday evening.

Having enjoyed a team bonding BBQ at their training ground on Wednesday, Barcelona must now focus on a crucial run of games.

After Eibar the Catalan giants host Manchester City on Wednesday in the Champions League last 16 second leg, having won the first 2-1 last month thanks to a brace from Luis Suarez.

Four days later at the Nou Camp Barcelona host rivals Real Madrid and Neymar is determined to treat the El Clasico like a final to gain the required result and keep the treble dream rolling.

Neymar said: 'I think we have the team to think about winning the treble. Leo (Messi) is the best in the world and (Luis) Suárez is a great goalscorer.

'We will give everything to win. I don't want to choose one title, I want to win all three.

'We are strong in the way we train and the relationship inside the dressing room has improved, now the atmosphere in the squad is spectacular.

‘'El Clasico' will be a final and we have to prepare as such. They are a very tough team but we only have to think about victory.

'The season is very long and there are still many games to play. We'll have to play our game and focus on winning.'
