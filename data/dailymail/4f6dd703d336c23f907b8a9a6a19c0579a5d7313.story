Centre-back Michael Duff looks set to miss a fourth game with his calf problem while Stephen Ward (ankle) and Matt Taylor (Achilles) are still some way off.

Provisional squad: Heaton, Trippier, Shackell, Mee, Reid, Wallace, Kightly, Cisak, Sordell, Marney, Jutkiewicz, Boyd, Gilks, Keane, Long, Barnes, Arfield, Ings, Chalobah, Jones.
