Some see the addition of Jimmy Graham to the Seattle Seahawks' offense as one of the best moves of free agency, but Michael Bennett still thinks he's overrated. 

Bennett labelled the tight end 'soft' and 'overrated', not to mention adding that 'he didn't like him as a person or a player', after Seattle's playoff win over the Saints two years ago.

And now that Graham's on board to seemingly add a genuine red zone threat to Darrell Bevell's predominantly ground and pound offense, the defensive end had some choice words for his new team-mate.

'I still feel the same way,' Bennett told 710 ESPN Seattle.

'Just because he's on my team I don't stop feeling that way. Obviously I'm going to be a better team-mate to him because he's on my team. I can't do the things I was doing to him when we were playing him.'

Bennett did soften a little, adding: 'Obviously, I'm going to be a better team-mate to him because he's on my team. I can't do the things I was doing to him when we were playing him.

'When he comes to our team, he's a part of our team. We have a different philosophy than they have with the Saints so the things that he was expected to do [with] the Saints are going to be different when he comes here. Obviously, we're a running team, so he's going to have to block and do all those things.

'I don't feel as harsh as I did at the time because he's my team-mate now, but at the time he was on the opposite team, a team that we played that was pretty good and we battled with them a couple times, and I didn't really like that team.'

Bennett came on the airwaves to address rumours that he had asked for a trade to join former defensive co-ordinator Dan Quinn at the Atlanta Falcons.

'I never asked for it. I didn't come to them asking for a trade. I'm still trying to figure out how a guy from Dallas make up a story about me. I'm living in Seattle, I'm like, "How does that happen?"'

'I'm in Hawaii surfing, got the kids surfing in the ocean and they are talking about something else.

The story was broken by Clarence Hill of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, and it appeared to vex the ebullient Bennett, who added: 'Man, like I said, they made rumours about Jesus, they'll make rumours about anybody.'

Bennett will come face-to-face with Graham on April 20 when the Seahawks begin their official off-season training programme.
