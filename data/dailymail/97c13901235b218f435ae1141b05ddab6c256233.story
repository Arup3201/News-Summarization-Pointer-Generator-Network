Wearing body armour and helmets and brandishing sub-machine guns, these police officers are leaving nothing to chance as they hunt down their quarry.

Is it a cornered knife maniac they are about to confront  – or a bank robber toting a sawn-off shotgun?

Er, no. They’re up against an escaped cow – a terrified young heifer which has made a dash for freedom from a livestock market.

Heifer hunting: Police armed with sub-machine guns, pictured, patrolled a street in rural Wales before shooting an escaped cow

The animal leapt over a cattle grid and ran down a bypass and residential streets in the town of Welshpool in central Wales.

Police were called – and soon  officers arrived armed with  Heckler and Koch semi- automatic machine guns.

The cow’s freedom was shortlived because when the animal had been cornered it was shot dead.

Last night residents in the town 
condemned the police reaction.

Shot: Police said attempts to round up the animal, pictured, failed so they had to 'destroy' it

Julie Macleod, who saw the incident, said
 the response  was ‘over the top’.

She said: ‘It was awful. Why did they 
have to shoot it? There was no need, it was only a heifer. If it was a 
bull then I would understand but it’s only a heifer.’  Another resident 
said: ‘It was completely unnecessary. Farmers have to catch runaway cows
 all the time so they didn’t have to go and shoot it dead like that. I 
think it’s dreadful.

‘Why didn’t they let it calm down and then take it back to the market? It’s wrong and a massive over-reaction.’

The drama happened just after 9am on 
Monday when the animal fled the livestock market and ended up in the 
back garden of a house.

Police officers were joined by farmers and an auctioneer as they tried to assess how agitated the animal was.

The property was cordoned off and after more than two hours a police marksman was called in to put the heifer down.

As he set up station at the rear of 
the property with his rifle, two colleagues stood ready with sub-machine
 guns. Bystanders were moved away while the marksman fired four shots to
 kill the heifer.

Concerned: Residents, pictured, feared for their safety with the cow on the loose, however some said the shooting was 'over the top'

Mad dash: Witnesses, pictured, saw the plucky heifer make a dash for it from Welshpool Livestock Market on Monday

A police spokesman said: ‘We received a
 report at approximately 9.10am this morning that a cow had escaped from
 Welshpool Livestock Market.

‘There were concerns for the safety of
 the general public and police personnel together with a risk of damage 
to property within the area. The only safe option left was to humanely 
destroy the animal.’
