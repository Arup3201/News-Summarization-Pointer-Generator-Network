As the world was going about its business in July 2012, a solar storm of epic proportions was speeding through Earth's orbit. 

Researchers in California and China said a rapid succession of coronal mass ejections - intense eruptions on the Sun - that took place between 22 and 23 July caused a pulse of magnetised plasma to hurtle towards the planet.

A study has now revealed that if these eruptions had taken place just nine days earlier, this solar blast would have smashed into Earth, potentially wiping out power supplies, phone signals and satellite communication.

A succession of intense eruptions on

potentially wiping out power supplies

Researchers in California and China said
 a rapid succession of coronal mass ejections - intense eruptions on the
 sun - that took place in July 2012 caused a pulse of magnetised 
plasma to hurtle through Earth's orbit.

The huge 
outburst on the sun, on 22 July, propelled a magnetic cloud through the 
solar wind at a peak speed of more than 1,242 miles per second (2,000 
km/s).

This is four times the typical speed of a magnetic storm.

It tore through Earth’s orbit but, luckily, Earth and the other planets were on the other side of the sun at the time.

If the eruptions had taken place nine days earlier, Earth would have been directly in line with the ignition spot on the sun.

Any
 planets in the line of sight would have suffered severe magnetic storms
 as the magnetic field of the outburst tangled with the planets’ own 
magnetic fields.

This has the potential to wipe out power supplies, phone signals and satellite communication.

The researchers added Earth would have been 'enveloped in magnetic fireworks matching the largest magnetic storm ever reported on Earth, the so-called Carrington event of 1859.'

The 1859 storm was so strong, the Northern 
Lights were said to be 
have been visible as far south as Hawaii. 

The Northern Lights predominantly appear in polar regions and are caused by the collision of energetic 
charged particles in the magnetosphere and solar wind.

Following the 1859 storm, telegraph services were disrupted worldwide.

In a paper, published in the journal Nature Communications, former University of California Berkeley postdoctoral fellow and research physicist Ying D. Liu, and UC Berkeley research physicist Janet G. Luhmann reported their analysis of the magnetic storm, which was detected by Nasa’s Stereo A spacecraft.

'Had it hit Earth, it probably would have been like the big one in 1859, but the effect today, with our modern technologies, would have been tremendous,' said Luhmann.

A study last year estimated the cost of a solar storm could reach $2.6 trillion worldwide.

This image was captured on 23 July 2012 by Nasa's Stereo A spacecraft. It shows a coronal mass ejection leaving the sun at speeds of more than 1,200 miles per second (2,000 km/s) - four times the typical speed of a magnetic storm. It tore through Earth's orbit but the planet was on other side of the sun at the time

In 1859 a solar storm known as the Solar Superstorm, or Carrington Event named after Richard Carrington who 
recorded it, saw numerous solar flares appear.

From 28 August 28 to 2 September sunspots and solar flares were observed.

British astronomer Carrington 
observed the largest flare, which caused a major coronal mass ejection -
 a massive burst of solar wind and magnetic field - to travel directly 
toward Earth.

It was so strong that the Northern 
Lights - a natural light display that appears predominantly in that 
Arctic and Antarctic regions caused by the collision of energetic 
charged particles in the magnetosphere and solar wind - were said to be 
have been visible as far south as Hawaii.

Telegraph services were also disrupted.

'An extreme space weather storm - a solar superstorm - is a low-probability, high-consequence event that poses severe threats to critical infrastructures of the modern society,' warned Liu, who now works at the National Space Science Centre of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.

'The cost of an extreme space weather event, if it hits Earth, could reach trillions of dollars with a potential recovery time of 4-10 years.

'Therefore, it is paramount to the security and economic interest of the modern society to understand solar superstorms.'

Based on their analysis of the 2012 event, Liu and Luhmann concluded that a huge outburst on the sun on 22 July propelled a magnetic cloud through the solar wind at a peak speed of more than 1,240 miles per second (2,000 km/s).

This is four times the typical speed of a magnetic storm.

It tore through Earth’s orbit but, luckily, Earth and the other planets were on the other side of the sun at the time.

Any planets in the line of sight would have suffered severe magnetic storms as the magnetic field of the outburst tangled with the planets’ own magnetic fields.

This diagram shows the route Nasa's Stereo spacecrafts take around the sun. Stereo is made up of two observatories - one ahead of Earth in its orbit, Stereo A, and  the other trailing behind, Stereo B. Scientists use the crafts to see the structure and evolution of solar storms as they blast from the sun

During the sun's cycle the amount of solar activity reaches peaks and troughs known as Solar Maximum and Minimum. During Solar Maximum, solar activity is at its highest due to a flip, or reversal, of the sun's magnetic field, illustration pictured. This causes the sun's electromagnetic radiation to grows by around 0.1%

During the sun's cycle, the amount of solar activity reaches peaks and troughs known as Solar Maximum and Solar Minimum.

During Solar Maximum the amount of solar activity is at its highest due to a flip, or reversal, of the sun's magnetic field.

Since
 1976 there have been three Solar Maximums and they occur roughly every 
11 years, although this can vary from between nine and 14 years.

During
 a Solar Maximum, large numbers of sunspots appear and the sun's 
irradiance - or electromagnetic radiation - output grows by around 0.1 
per cent.

This increase in energy can impact global climate and recent studies have shown some correlation with regional weather patterns.

'The authors believe this extreme event was due to the interaction of two CMEs separated by only 10 to 15 minutes,' said Joe Gurman, project scientist for Stereo at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Centre.

'People keep saying that these are rare natural hazards, but they are happening in the solar system even though we don’t always see them,' Luhmann added. 'It’s like with earthquakes - it is hard to impress upon people the importance of preparing unless you suffer a magnitude 9 earthquake.'

The goal of Stereo and other satellites probing the magnetic fields of the sun and Earth is to understand how and why the sun sends out these large solar storms and to be able to predict them during the sun’s 11-year solar cycle.

These are intense eruptions which take place on the surface of the Sun

The eruptions sent a pulse of magnetised plasma through Earth's orbit

If they had happened just nine days earlier, when Earth was aligned with the location of the eruptions, this plasma would have struck the planet
