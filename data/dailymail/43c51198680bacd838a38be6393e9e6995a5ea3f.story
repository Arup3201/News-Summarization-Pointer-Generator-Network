On the run: Police are looking for Ryan Elkins, 23, in connection with multiple robberies in Florida

The parents of a woman wanted for seducing men in bars, drugging and robbing them have spoken out about how their daughter's life spiraled out of control after she fell under the clutches of a pimp.

Police are seeking Ryan Elkins, 23, one of 'four foxy thieves' who allegedly carried out a series of thefts totaling more than half a million dollars in cash, guns, luxury watches, diamonds and other
possessions.

The four thieves would frequent bars and clubs in Fort Lauderdale, Florida before seducing men and robbing them, police said.

Two of the women have been arrested, while two remain at large.

Elkins' parents, retired NYPD cop Jeff Elkins, 60, and his wife Pamela, said they are heartbroken over their daughter's fall from a promising student with dreams of becoming a nurse.

'We'll never understand what happened,' her father told the Sun Sentinel. 'It's a parents worst nightmare.'

The
couple, who lives in Staten Island, New York, said they now only hear 
from Elkins, who has a young son, if she has bad news. 'I always expect the worst,' Jeff Elkins added.

Her son was fathered by a pimp who controls her, they said.

Out of control: Elkins, who has previously been arrested for prostitution and larceny, met a pimp in a nightclub in Manhattan five years ago. Her parents said that is when her life began spiraling out of control

'They've turned her into someone we 
don't recognize,' her mother said. 'They took her away, and this is 
what they did to her.'

Before
she met him, she dabbled in partying as a teenager and would sneak out 
from the house, but they assumed it was an adolescent phase.

But she met the pimp in a Manhattan nightclub around five years ago, and was won over by money and cars, her parents said.

They added that they believe she has an undiagnosed mental-health disorder.

Expensive tastes: Johnnina Miller is also on the run after allegedly being involved in the plot

'She has no fear of anything,' Jeff Elkins said. 'She has no feelings. She's just detached form everything, it's just not normal.

'We love her. We don't understand what's going on. We can't figure it out. We probably never will.'

Of the four women, Johnnina Miller, 25, and Elkins are still on the loose. Subhanna Beyah, 25, and Keisha Clark, 27, were arrested last week on grand-theft charges.

Beyah, who used Crystal as one of her aliases, was arrested in the Queens area of  New York on Sunday.

Keisha Clarke turned herself into Miami Dade police on Thursday. She posted bail the following day.

Giants defensive tackle Shaun Rogers 
met Beyah in March at Club Liv in Miami, and then brought her back to 
his Fontainebleau Hotel room, according to the New York Daily News.

After waking up around 12:30pm, the 
safe in his room was missing more than $400,000 worth of jewelry which 
included diamond earrings valued at $100,000, two watches valued at 
$160,000 and a Cuban necklace and pendant valued at $70,000, police 
said.

On another occasion she met a man at 
an upscale restaurant and went back to his house in Pompano Beach where 
she made him a cocktail.

Victim: Giants defensive tackle Shaun Rogers met Beyah at a club in Miami and then brought her back to his hotel room. He woke up to find more than $500,000 worth of jewelry was missing

The 45-year-old woke up the following
afternoon and discovered that $6,000 in cash and his collection of 
expensive watches - two Rolexes, one Cartier and one Panerai totaling 
$80,000 to $100,000 - were gone.

On
April 27 Beyah worked with Elkins to con a 54-year-old they met at an 
unspecified club. While Beyah distracted the man, Elkins made him a 
drink that made him enter 'what he described as a drug-like state' 
rendering him unconscious, according to the affidavit. 

When
he awoke hours later, two of his Glock 9mm handguns, a Smith & 
Wesson .38 caliber handgun, a Rolex watch and three 3.5 carat marquise 
diamonds worth more than $250,000 were missing.

Another victim, Steven Kesto, described 
meeting Beyah and another woman at Blue Martini on Feb 20.

He took them 
back to his condo where the last thing he remembers was sitting on his 
bed with the women, being encouraged to sip a vodka cranberry they had 
mixed.

When he woke up he found the women were gone, along with his iPad and a $27,000 Cartier diamond and gold watch.

He also felt terrible. His heart raced, breathing was difficult and he had a headache.

Another 
incident involved just Miller and Clark, who tag-teamed to steal from a 
man they met at Blue Martini. They convinced the 54-year-old to bring 
them back to his place where he 'began to feel like he was in a drugged 
state.

When he awoke, he was missing $300 cash, an iPhone, an iPad, an American Express card, a debit card and a $8,000 watch.

Clark
used the debit card to withdraw more than $500 dollars from the man's bank 
account, according to PNC bank security footage taken the next day.

Beyah's prior record includes nearly two
dozen arrests stemming from charges of prostitution, grand theft, 
fraud, forgery, and illegal use of credit cards. She has gone by the 
name Christina More, Christian Moore, Christine Brown, Christin Miller 
and Crystal Alex Jones.

Elkins has been arrested three times, twice for prostitution in February and November 2009 and once for larceny last September.

Mistress of disguise: Beyah is mentioned in three cases, and has been arrested nearly two dozen times before on charges ranging from prostitution to forgery

Clark
has been arrested 14 times since June 2000, including charges of 
aggravated assault with a weapon, criminal mischief, larceny, fraud, 
burglary and battery . Miller, has been arrested six times on charges of
grand theft, prostitution, fraud and marijuana possession.

Police
were finally able to identify the suspects after working to compile 
physical evidence, surveillance videos and victim and witness 
interviews, according to Broward Sheriff's Office Detective Ronald 
Cusumano.

'We need to locate these women. They
are dangerous. They're giving people drugs. They could kill somebody,' 
Sheriff's spokesman Dani Moschella said last week.  told the Sun Sentinel.

Their
victims were mainly men between the ages 33 and 58 and they were 
targeted at bars such as Vibe Ultra Lounge, YOLO, Blue Martini, Dicey 
Riley's and the Elbo Room in Miami.
