A luxury retreat once voted the Daily Mail's house of the year for Dorset has gone on sale for £3.3million.

The three-bedroom property boasts a range of mod cons including a swimming pool, a gym, underfloor heating and solar panelling across 6,000 sq ft.

Built in 2009, the single storey home's enormous 1,200 sq ft open-plan living room is bigger than an average three-bedroom apartment.

Luxury: The property, which has a double garage, is in an exclusive residential area close to the coast

Located in the well-heeled area of Branksome Park in Poole, Dorset, it even has two fully-equipped kitchens - one for day-to-day cooking and the other for entertaining.

It also has an indoor garden and 12ft high ceilings.

The gated property is set in three quarters of an acre of lush landscaped gardens less than a mile from stunning Branksome Chine beach.

The house was crowned the Daily Mail's house of the year for Dorset in 2009 by a select judging panel after a nationwide search.

It is now being sold by Savills at a guide price of £3.295million.

Its current owners, a couple from London, bought the house to use as a holiday home but put it on the market because they don't use it enough.

Keith Fensom, from Savills, said: 'This property is a very attractive house.

'It is all on one level so it is essentially a bungalow - but its cutting edge design and state-of-the-art technology means it is a bungalow for the 21st century.

'It has some really fantastic features. The open plan living room and kitchen is huge - we sell three bedroom apartments that are smaller.
