A lone driver's mini-van was turned into a deadly weapon after he rammed into a crowd of pedestrians, killing himself and at least seven others.

The 30-year-old drove through a crowded intersection in the geisha district of Kyoto today, ploughing into bystanders before smashing into a post that halted the rampage.

The cause of the accident is still under investigation but the unnamed male driver was understood to have epilepsy.

But police are not sure if he had a fit and passed out at the wheel or had gone out intent on murder.

Deadly: Medics and bystanders help care for the injured and dying strewn around the busy street

Rescue officials and witnesses said the mini-van ignored a traffic light and entered a main intersection in Gion, Kyoto's main geisha district, knocking over pedestrians and smashing into an electric pole.

The area was packed with tourists, many of whom were there to see the famous cherry blossom in the city.

TV footage showed pools of blood and belongings scattered on the ground as paramedics treated the injured in the street.

Hit: A victim lies motionless on a stretcher as she is carried away from the scene of the crash

The 30-year-old driver and seven pedestrians died, Kyoto prefectural police spokesman Akira Koga said.

Eight other people were injured, including several in serious condition. The driver was the only one in the van, Koga said, correcting an earlier report by rescue officials who apparently mistook a pedestrian as a passenger.

A court in December sentenced a man to seven years in prison for fatally running over six children in Tochigi, near Tokyo, when he had epileptic seizures while driving a crane without taking necessary medication.

The Japanese Epilepsy Association appealed this week to the Justice Minister and the National Public Safety Commission chairman to seek ways to eliminate prejudice against epileptic patients but take effective measures to raise awareness among themselves about the dangers of driving.

The association says about 1 million Japanese have epilepsy.
