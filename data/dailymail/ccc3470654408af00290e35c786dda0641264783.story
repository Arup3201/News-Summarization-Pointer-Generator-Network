Postcards sketched by Britain's most notorious convict Charles Bronson worth thousands of pounds have been discovered in a drawer in a London art gallery.

The collection of postcards, hand-drawn by Bronson, were found buried beneath old canvases and paper scraps and will now be offered for sale at the Zebra One Gallery in Hampstead, London.

The owner of the gallery, Gabrielle du Plooy believes there will be a high demand from collectors, and has pledged to donate the money raised from the sale of the postcards to the families of Bronson's victims. 

The Birdman Of Broadmoor was one of the pieces of work found in the drawer of an art gallery

One of the most recent images of criminal Charles Bronson taken inside Wakefield Prison in June 2004

Two hundred of the jailbird's works were sold for more than £30,000 at an auction in Leicestershire recently, coinciding with the discovery.

In an attempt to distance himself from his violent past, the criminal has changed his last name to 'Salvador', in homage to surrealist artist, Salvador Dali.

He is said to spend his days in his cell, painting and sketching to pass the time during his life sentence.

Speaking about the postcards, Ms du Plooy said: 'They are ridiculous but you can certainly see the influence of Salvador Dali.'

The postcards were originally procured by the gallery's former owner, Ms du Plooy's father, who acquired them from Bedlam Bar in Hampstead, which is now closed. 

The postcards are thought to be worth thousands of pounds

Manson changed his surname to Salvador after the artist Salvador Dali, it is thought he influenced his work

'It was a very dark and dingy bar with loads of mad artwork on the walls,' said Ms du Plooy. 'You walked in and it was quite literally bedlam - there were chains and skulls everywhere. 

'We were doing all their framing for them and we were given these postcards.'

'The pieces of art are authenticated by Bronson's own signature, along with a note that reads 'a Bronson creation'. 

'The postcards are also annotated with the addresses of the prisons where the sketches were drawn, along with the convict's prison number: 1314.'

A lot of the artworks show words such as Insanity and Asylum

The notorious convict signs each of the postcards to make his mark

This postcard called the Beast of Dartmoor features an angry looking man 

The 61-year-old criminal is currently serving a life sentence in HM Full Sutton prison in York. 

He has spent 36 years in solitary confinement after numerous attacks on prison staff and fellow inmates, including instigating hostage incidents.

But he recently hit headlines again when one of his pieces was stolen from a gallery in east London. 

The hardman - who was portrayed by Tom Hardy in the film Bronson - chillingly warned the thieves: 'Pray that I never catch up with you.' 

Despite being drawn by one of Britain's most notorious criminals this postcard is quite sweet in design

Charles marks his postcards with the words 'A BRONSON CREATION' 

This design features a pony with a small bird on the end of his nose
