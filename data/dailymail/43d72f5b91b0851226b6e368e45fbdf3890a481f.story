And although they are usually the plaything of small children, one grown woman is so obsessed with trolls dolls that she owns over 3,000.

Troll dolls were originally created in 1959 by Danish fisherman and woodcutter Thomas Dam who used his creative talents when he couldn't afford a Christmas gift for his daughter

He then sold them as Good Luck Trolls and they became a huge fad in American between 1963-1965

The fad spread to video games, a Trollies Radio Show and music hits based on trolls

After several companies copied the trolls, in 2003 a Congressional law allowed the Dam family of Denmark to restore their original U.S. copyright, allowing them to become the only official manufacturer

The brand was modernised by DIC Entertainment and became 'Trollz' in 2005 but was soon dropped after a lack of success

DreamWorks Animation recently announced that it has acquired the intellectual property for the Trolls franchise from the Dam Family and has 'big plans' to redevelop the toy
