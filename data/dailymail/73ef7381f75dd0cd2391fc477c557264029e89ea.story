It is a moment that every parent remembers and wants to cherish for the rest of their life.

But one father was forced to use Skype to get a glimpse of his newborn twins - because he was paralysed in another hospital more than 130 miles away.

William Jones, 31, missed the birth of his baby girls after a freak cycling accident left him with a broken back just weeks before the twins were due.

Mr Jones, of Plympton, Devon, had to spend 13 weeks in hospital and has been left wheelchair-bound.

Doctors have warned he will probably never walk again. 

William Jones, 31, was paralysed in a freak cycling accident just weeks before the birth of his twin daughters Alodie and Elizabeth. His wife, Kate, 29, said: 'It was difficult. He woke up and said he couldn't feel his legs. They pretty much said he wouldn't be able to walk again'

Mr Jones caught his first glimpse of his daughters via Skype - because he was in a hospital 130 miles away. He met them for the first time in November, three weeks after they were born on 18th October

Mr Jones had been cycling home from work when the accident happened. He said: 'I don't remember it but the police report said it was a freak accident with no other vehicles involved.' He broke his back, fractured his ribs, and punctured his lung in three places. He is pictured before the accident

The father-of-two, who worked for a bike company, was cycling home from work on September 16 last year when the accident happened.

He said: 'I don't remember it but the police report said it was a freak accident with no other vehicles involved.

'I dislocated my spine, fractured four ribs and had three punctures in my lung.'

He underwent a 10-hour operation at Derriford Hospital, Plymouth, while his wife, who was then 33 weeks pregnant, waited anxiously.

He spent three weeks in intensive care before being transferred to The Duke of Cornwall Spinal Treatment Centre, in Salisbury, for 10 weeks - days before the twins were due.

His wife Kate, whom he married  in July 2013, said: 'It was difficult. He woke up and said he couldn't feel his legs. They pretty much said he wouldn't be able to walk again.'

Mr Jones is now living nearly 10 miles away from his Kate, 29, and daughters Alodie and Elizabeth, four months, as there are no suitable homes for them.

He is forced to live in a facility for over 60s, because he can't get into his own Plympton home with his wheelchair.

Mr Jones is now living 10 miles away from his daughters, now four months, as there are no suitable homes for the family, in a situation he calls 'disgusting'. 'I'm missing out on my children growing up,' he said

Hospice worker Kate has stayed in the family's privately rented home. Despite the family being on the housing list, they can't find anywhere to live.

The couple described the housing situation as 'disgusting'.

Mr Jones said: 'To say that the later part of the year was traumatic is an understatement.'

'We just want to be together and begin our new lives as a family and move on from this horrific injury that has changed all our lives forever.

'I'm missing out on my children growing up and I'm also not able to support my poor wife at a time she needs it most.' 

'Kate and I kept in good contact throughout her pregnancy. She went really quiet one morning and four hours later or so she texted me something along the lines of "you're a daddy now".

Kate Jones says she wants to go back to work and to start campaigning to make sure there is adequate housing for people who are disabled. Mr Jones is also hoping to get back on his bike and try 'arm cycling'

'We then Skyped as soon as we could. The whole family are all amazing. They are what's given me the inspiration to get better.

'But it's such a problem that we haven't been housed. We haven't had the chance to be a young family and there does not seem to be anything we can do. It is really, really bad.

'We can't afford a deposit for a house and every house that comes up seems to go to other people. 

'We've tried going private but landlords don't want to change their houses even though we can get a £25,000 grant.

'I'm really hoping I can go back to work and I want to start campaigning to make sure there are enough properties available for those who are disabled.'

'William is also hoping he can get back on a bike and will perhaps try "arm cycling".'
