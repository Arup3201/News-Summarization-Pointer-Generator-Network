A BBC newsreader’s slip of the tongue saw him refer to 'this budget s***' by mistake last night.

Tim Willcox was talking about the US Army chief of staff’s comments that the Government shutdown was badly damaging day-to-day operations and a rapid resolution to the funding row must be found.

The 50-year-old presenter, who was on the BBC News Channel just before 4.30pm yesterday with co-host Emily Maitlis, 43, said: ‘Let’s get more now on the U.S. budget shutdown.

Slip of the tongue: Tim Willcox, 50, was presenting on the BBC News Channel just before 4.30pm yesterday with co-host Emily Maitlis, 43, when he accidentally referred to 'this budget s***'

‘We were just hearing from the head of the army in Brussels, US General Ray Odierno saying that they needed to resolve this budget s***… shutdown as soon as possible.’

The error - which came after he also had trouble pronouncing General Odierno's name - at 4.24pm was spotted on Twitter by Sheffield-based software developer Dan Sumption.

Mr Sumption said: 'Newsreader on BBC News just read out "they need to sort out this budget s***... budget shutdown as soon as possible.’

The BBC said today that while Mr Willcox did appear to stumble over his words, he did not clearly swear.

Mistake: Mr Willcox quickly corrected the word to 'shutdown' after making the error on the channel yesterday

Mr Willcox has been married to Sarah, 49, for around 18 years and has four school-age children.

But last November it was claimed the 
married father-of-four was having an affair with fellow newsreader 
Sophie Long, 36, who dumped her husband for him.

Born in 1963, Mr Willcox was educated at 
Taunton School in Somerset and St Chad's College, Durham University, 
where he read Spanish. He began his career in newspapers at Mirror Group
Newspapers and Fleet Street News Agency.

He worked for ITN News as a presenter and correspondent. After joining ITN's news team, he presented the network's live reports from New York City during the terror attacks of 9/11 in 2001.

In September 2010, he was sent to Chile to report on the rescue of 33 trapped miners. And in 2011, he reported from Japan on the country’s earthquake and subsequent tsunami.

It comes as the US Government limped into a third day of partial shutdown after a White House meeting among President Barack Obama and top congressional leaders yielded no signs of progress.

However, it gave plenty of evidence that Democrats and Republicans remained riven over a dispute that has idled hundreds of thousands of federal workers and curtailed services nationwide.
