Everton have often been the architects of their own downfall this season and it was more of the same in the 3-2 defeat by Newcastle at St James' Park on Sunday. 

Aiden McGeady's misplaced pass led to Ayoze Perez's strike and Ross Barkley's poor control allowed Jack Colback to score the winner, meaning the Toffees have now made 10 errors leading directly to goals this season.

Not only is that the highest amount in the Premier League, no other team in Europe's top five divisions has had more serious mistakes punished.

Toffees boss Roberto Martinez has seen his side make 10 errors leading to goals already this season

Everton (Premier League) - 10

Parma (Serie A) - 10

Evian (Ligue 1) - 9

Borussia Dortmund (Bundesliga) - 9

Granada (La Liga) - 8 

Italian strugglers Parma, who are bottom of Serie A with just six points from 16 games, have also managed to cost themselves 10 goals because of poor decisions and execution.

Everton's figure is almost double the amount made by Sunderland and Liverpool (six), who sit joint second in the table of goal-costing errors.

The Toffees had only conceded 18 goals at the same stage of last season but it's been a different story under Roberto Martinez since August, with 31 let in already.

Liverpool have conceded six goals due to defensive errors - the joint second highest amount in the division

Sylvain Distin, Phil Jagielka, Gareth Barry and Tim Howard have all made howlers, leaving the Merseyside outfit much closer to the drop zone than a coveted spot in the top four.

Below Sunderland and Liverpool in the table sit Newcastle, West Brom and Crystal Palace, each of whom have made five errors leading directly to goals so far.

Aston Villa, Leicester and Arsenal have all made four, while Tottenham, Manchester City, QPR and West Ham have all made three.

Despite only being out of the relegation zone on goal difference, Steve Bruce's Hull have made just mistakes which have led directly to goals - the same amount as high-flying Southampton.

But the best record in the division is shared by Manchester United, Burnley, Chelsea, Stoke and Swansea, all of whom have conceded just once because of an individual error.

 

Everton - 10

Sunderland - 6

Liverpool - 6

Newcastle - 5

Crystal Palace - 5

West Brom - 5

Aston Villa - 4

Leicester - 4

Arsenal - 4 

Tottenham - 3 

West Ham - 3

Manchester City - 3 

QPR - 3

Hull - 2

Southampton - 2

Manchester United - 1

Burnley - 1
