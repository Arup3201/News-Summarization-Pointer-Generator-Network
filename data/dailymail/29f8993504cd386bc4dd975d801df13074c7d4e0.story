Sunshine. Remember that? 

In gloomy winter months it’s not just the warmth of the sun’s rays you miss — you may also suffer lower levels of vitamin D, the sunshine vitamin.

Vitamin D is important for bone health — low levels are linked to fractures in adults and rickets in children.

Last week, a report by the NHS advisory body the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), said more people should be given vitamin D tablets to counter a hidden epidemic of deficiency

Last week, a report by the NHS advisory body the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), said more people should be given vitamin D tablets to counter a hidden epidemic of deficiency, with ten million people across England possibly affected.

Many thousands rely on supplements on prescription to ensure their levels are adequate. 

Two years ago, the country’s chief medical officers highlighted the need for vitamin D to be given to pregnant and breastfeeding women, children under five and the elderly.

Prescriptions soared as a result. 

However, NHS figures suggest the majority are being made up not with supplements licensed for medical use, but with food supplements that are not subjected to the same rigorous controls.

Indeed, 59 per cent of the 190,000 prescriptions issued in England every month for vitamin D are being made up with unlicensed products, according to NHS Prescription Cost Analysis data for 2013.

Experts warn this could lead to patients getting the wrong dose — they may continue to be deficient or end up with too much vitamin D (which leads to more calcium being absorbed from the gut, raising the risk of bone pain and kidney stones).

‘It’s outrageous that unlicensed vitamin D products are prescribed when licensed ones are available,’ says Dr Peter Feldschreiber, a medical barrister and author of The Law And Regulation Of Medicines.

‘Patients are being put at risk because there’s no quality control. 

'With a licensed medicine, all its ingredients are known, have been tested and their safety at the stated dose confirmed. 

'But the content of unlicensed vitamin D products can vary hugely.’

Some provide just 8 per cent of the stated dose, while others deliver 201 per cent, according to research published in Nutrition Health and Aging in 2013.

Two years ago, the country’s chief medical officers highlighted the need for vitamin D to be given to pregnant and breastfeeding women, children under five and the elderly. Prescriptions soared as a result

Dr Feldschreiber, a former senior medical assessor with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), says a sample analysed for a different study found ‘one product had only 14 per cent of the stated dose while another had 171 per cent’. 

The number of vitamin D prescriptions has risen by 8,000 per cent since 2008.

The problem is that prescribers have only six licensed medicines at their disposal and they do not come in every dosing permutation, says Dr Brian Curwain, a clinical scientist and independent pharmaceutical consultant.

Licensed products come in doses of 800, 3,200, 10,000 and 25,000 international units. 

So when a GP writes a prescription for 1,000 units, that can be filled only by an unlicensed product.

‘If the pharmacist wants to dispense the licensed 800 unit medicine instead, he’d have to ask the doctor if the prescription can be amended,’ says Dr Curwain. 

‘Community pharmacists are often too busy, so the unlicensed product is dispensed.’

He is also concerned that food supplement manufacturers can change the formulation of their product without notice.

‘It looks the same, but the ingredients may include something you’re allergic to,’ he says.

The Royal Pharmaceutical Society says the situation is ‘worrying’. So why does it continue?

Surprisingly, licensed medications are 50 per cent cheaper than unlicensed products, says Dr Feldschreiber. 

The problem is that while licensed medicines fall within the MHRA’s remit, food supplements do not. 

Yet the Food Standards Agency claims they are not its responsibility, either.

A spokesman for the MHRA said: ‘NHS prescribing policy and practice is the responsibility of the Department of Health.’

Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Department of Health said: ‘Where there is no licensed product to meet a patient’s needs, it is appropriate that prescribers can prescribe another product.’

In its first draft of its new guidance in May, NICE made no mention of the importance of filling vitamin D prescriptions with licensed medicines, a decision that was criticised by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society.

In its latest guidance, it urges the Department of Health to work with manufacturers to ensure licensed vitamin D products containing the recommended nutrient intake are available on prescription and supplements should undergo quality checks to ensure they contain the correct dose.

However, there is no mention of who is responsible for carrying out such checks on the unlicensed ones on sale in the High Street.

The good news is that from next year two additional licensed products — one of 400 units and another of 25,000 units — will be available.
