Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has spoken out for the first time about the allegations against Gen. John Allen, that he had 'inappropriate communications' with Florida housewife and military social liaison Jill Kelley.

Allen, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, is under investigation for his correspondence with Kelley, who is also embroiled in the David Petraeus sex scandal.

Investigators are looking at 20,000-plus pages of documents and emails between Kelley and Allen, some of which have been described  by Pentagon officials as 'flirtatious.' Allen has denied any wrongdoing.

Panetta told a press conference that Gen Allen has his continued confidence to lead U.S. forces in Afghanistan

Investigators are reviewing between 20,000 to 30,000 pages of emails between socialite Jill Kelley and General John Allen

Panetta, speaking at a news conference 
in Perth on Wednesday, cautioned against reaching early conclusions 
about the veracity of allegations against Gen. Allen, which have added a
new dimension to the Petraeus matter.

'No one should leap to any conclusions here,' Panetta said in his first public comments on the matter when a reporter asked what Allen might have done wrong.

Panetta said he supports Allen, who has been in command in Kabul since July 2011. He took over that summer for Petraeus, who retired from the Army to head the CIA.

'He certainly has my continued confidence to lead our forces and to continue the fight,' Panetta said.

The Pentagon chief declined to explain the nature of Allen's correspondence with Jill Kelley, the Florida socialite connected to the scandal that led to Petraeus' resignation last week as director of the CIA.

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who appeared with Panetta and their Australian counterparts at Wednesday's news conference, declined to comment on the Allen case except to suggest it has not harmed the war effort.

Details emerged last Friday that General Petraeus had had an affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell

US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said there was 'no concern whatsoever' that allegations about Gen. Allen would impact the U.S. mission in Afghanistan

She said U.S. officials have discussed the matter with allied officials.

'There has been a lot of conversation, as you might expect, but no concern whatsoever being expressed to us because the mission has been set forth and it's being carried out,' Clinton said.

Panetta announced Tuesday while flying to Australia that he had ordered the Defense Department's inspector general to investigate Allen based on material referred to the Pentagon on Sunday by the FBI. Pentagon officials said the material included at least 20,000 pages of Allen correspondence.

Allen told Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that he is innocent of misconduct, according to Col. David Lapan, Dempsey's spokesman.

Lapan said Wednesday that Dempsey called Allen on Tuesday from Perth, where Dempsey attended meetings with Panetta. Dempsey has not commented publicly.

Panetta had also announced Tuesday that the Obama administration put on hold Allen's nomination to be the next commander of U.S. European Command and the top NATO general. Allen's Senate confirmation hearing was to have been held Thursday.

Panetta said in Perth that putting a hold on the nomination was the 'prudent' thing to do.

Allen, who was in Washington when Panetta announced the investigation and has not yet returned to his headquarters in Kabul, has not publicly commented on the matter.
