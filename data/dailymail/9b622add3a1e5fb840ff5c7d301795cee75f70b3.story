Actor Paul Bhattacharjee was declared bankrupt three days before his body was found near cliffs after he disappeared from a London theatre, it has been reported.

The Casino Royale star's body was found in Seaford, Essex, two days after he went missing on July 10.

High Court records show he had attended a bankruptcy hearing on the previous day and that his case had been adjourned from April 30.

He was declared bankrupt at the hearing where the action was brought by HMRC, the Independent reported.

The scale of his debt and whether there were any other creditors involved has not been revealed.

Mr Bhattacharjee, who also appeared in Eastenders, was last 
seen leaving rehearsals at the Royal Court Theatre in Sloane Square, 
London, on Wednesday July 10 and appeared to walk in the direction of a 
nearby Tube station.

The 53-year-old was said to be in 
good spirits that evening but after sending his girlfriend a text 
message at 9pm, no-one heard from him and he was reported missing.

Scotland Yard was contacted by 
officers in Sussex and told that the body of a man matching
his description had been found near cliffs at Splash Point in Seaford, 
East Sussex. 

Mr Bhattacharjee, from Redbridge, 
north-east London, was formally identified and his next of kin 
have been informed. His death is not being treated as suspicious.

Meera Syal, who appeared alongside him in the Royal Shakespeare Company production of Much Ado about Nothing, said: 'Paul was an incredibly gifted, versatile and generous actor but also complex, deep thinking, engagingly opinionated and politically committed as a personality, truly wonderful to share a stage with.

'I don't think any of us who saw him recently or were working with him had any idea this awful tragedy was going to happen.

'We are all sending our love and prayers to his family and partner.'

Mr Bhattacharjee  was due to appear Talk Show at the Royal Court. His role in the play, which began on Tuesday, was recast.

The
theatre's artistic director Vicky Featherstone said: 'We are deeply 
shocked and completely devastated at the loss of our dear friend and 
brilliant colleague.

'Paul has been such an important part of the world of theatre in so many ways and we shall miss him terribly.

'We
can't even begin to imagine the impact his loss will have on everyone 
who knew him and all of our thoughts are with his loved ones. '

After his disappearance, the actor's friends and family had made pleas
for his safe return, including his 24-year-old son Rahul 
Bhattacharjee-Prashar, who told the Evening Standard the disappearance 
was 'completely out of character'.

Paul Bhattacharjee also made several TV appearances. Here he is seen opposite Peter Firth in the BBC spy series Spooks

Paul Bhattacharjee's theatre work included Moazzam Begg in the docu-drama Guantanamo at the Tricycle Theatre, north-west London, and Malvolio in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night at the Albery in London's West End

He added: 'He was doing well in his career and everything seemed to be going okay.'

Mr Bhattacharjee's agent had said he seemed 'completely fine' the last time she heard from him.

Sally Long-Innes, who works for the Independent Talent Group, said there
were 'no clues' as to why he disappeared in his last text to her.

She said: 'He seemed completely fine to me. As far as we could tell there was nothing wrong with his state of mind.

'There were no clues in the last text message at all I'm afraid.'

Colleagues had taken to Twitter to 
express concern for Mr Bhattacharjee as news of his disappearance 
spread.

Bend It Like Beckham actress Parminder Nagra, Sex in the City 
star Kim Cattrall and Stephen Fry - who went missing for a week in 1995 -
all appealed to their followers for information about the actor.

Tributes were last night being paid to the actor with many from the theatre world taking to Twitter to express their sadness.

Royal Court Theatre on July 10, played the lead role of Benedick last year in the 
RSC's production of Much Ado About Nothing with Meera Syal as Beatrice

Director Jamie Lloyd wrote: 'Very sad
to hear about the death of Paul Bhattacharjee. He was a very fine 
actor. My thoughts are with his family.'

Muzz
Khan, who appeared in Much Ado About Nothing alongside the late actor, 
said: 'Rest In Peace, Paul Bhattacharjee. I can't believe you're gone, 
mate.'

Playwright Duncan 
Gates wrote: 'When you depart from me sorrow abides and happiness takes 
his leave'. RIP Paul Paul Bhattacharjee.'

Actor Rick Warden wrote: 'Having a 
bad time with the news about friend and colleague Paul Bhattacharjee's 
death. An intelligent & charismatic man. Very sad.'

Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, White Teeth and Dirty Pretty Things, as well as playing a doctor in Casino Royale
