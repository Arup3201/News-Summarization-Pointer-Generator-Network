Nancy Hernandez told the Daily News:
 'I walked out into my living room, and he was just standing there.

'I 
was scared. Why would he just walk into my home like that? He gave me 
the creeps.'

attempted murder, robber, burglary and child endangerment, and is being

Tracked down: Police caught Shawn Custis after releasing an old mug shot of the suspected home invader

Camera
 footage shows the sickening attack, which took place as the woman's 
terrified three-year-old daughter cowered on the sofa and her baby boy 
slept upstairs.

Police say they identified the convicted robber from the nanny cam images.

The
 woman and her daughter were watching morning cartoons on the couch when
 bolted front door was kicked in and the helpless mother was savagely 
attacked.

The woman said she was afraid to cry out in case it made her daughter scream, which would anger her attacker, NBC4 said.

'I
 knew that if I started screaming, my daughter would, too, and I was 
afraid she would get hurt. I took it. I didn’t cry the entire time.'

As she was punched and kicked at least 16 times, video shows the attacker turn and speak to the woman's daughter.

At a point, the invader seems to make physical contact with the child, but she was not injured.

The mother was treated in hospital 
for concussion and bruises to her face and body.

Deeply shaken: The young mother was tossed around ruthlessly, and beaten and kicked over and over as her infant son slept upstairs and cartoons played on the television

Merciless: The woman was kicked and punched even as she lay helplessly on the ground and the thief appears to pocket items from her person or the table beside her

Lasting: The attack occurred Friday morning while the woman's husband was at work in New York City. She was treated for a concussion and extensive bruising

Blind sided: The attack occurred on this tree-lined, Essex County, New Jersey street. The victim's blinds were closed and no car was in the driveway. Police believe the invader thought no one was home

Scarring: The little girl, 3, is seen here blurred at left. She watched her mother being attacked and at one point the invader appears to speak to her and possibly make contact with her. She was unharmed

She had several chipped
 teeth and received stitches near her mouth, police said.

The robber made off with an undetermined amount of jewelry, according to NBC News. But not before shoving his victim down the basement stairs.

She was taken to the hospital and treated for a concussion and extensive bruising on her face and body.

Her husband was at work in New York City when the invasion took place.

Police believe the suspect thought he would be alone when he entered the home as the blinds were drawn and no car sat in the driveway.

The family's neighbor's celebrated the news of the arrest on Friday, where residents have been uneasy since the attack. 

'This whole block, you could just hear a collective sigh of relief when the news started breaking that they got this guy,' Nick Romano told NBC4.

Loose: The thief shoved the woman down the basement stairs and made off with an unknown amount of jewelry. He remains at large and police think he's done this before
