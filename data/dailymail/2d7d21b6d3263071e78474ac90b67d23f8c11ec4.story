A 60-year-old suspected sexual predator was arrested wearing a Star Wars costume after meeting with Michigan police officers who pretended to be a child online.

Daniel Fritz, of Wayne County's Canton Township, has been charged with child sexually abusive activity and using a computer to communicate with another to commit a crime.

Officials say the investigation started after an ad ‘highly indicative of child sexual exploitation’ was posted on a social media website.

The force was not with him: Daniel Fritz, 60, pictured left in his booking photo, was arrested wearing a Star Wars costume (right) after meeting with police officers who posed online as a child

Detectives set up a fictitious sexual encounter in Roseville and arrested Fritz.

The elderly suspect was sporting a costume like that of the Star Wars bounty hunter character Boba Fett.

Fritz was arraigned last Wednesday. He is being held on $$50,000 bond pending a November 12 preliminary hearing in Roseville District Court.

The Macomb County Sheriff's Office has released a selfie taken by Fritz depicting the suspect posing in front of a bathroom mirror in a Boba Fett Helmet.

Investigators say Fritz made plans to meet the bogus child last Wednesday in Roseville for the  purpose of having sex with the minor.

According to sheriff's officials, when Fritz showed up for the meeting, he was already wearing the Boba Fett getup, which he completed upon arrival by putting on a helmet, The Smoking Gun reported.
