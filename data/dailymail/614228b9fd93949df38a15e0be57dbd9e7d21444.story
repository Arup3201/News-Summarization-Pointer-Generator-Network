He has gained worldwide fame for his unrivalled skill at solving cases, incredible powers of deduction and grasp of complex science. 

Now, the real-life figure who inspired Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's infamous detective, Sherlock Holmes, may have been uncovered.

Investigator Jerome Caminada captivated Manchester in the 19th century with his logical reasoning, eccentric disguises and impressive crime figures.

Inspiration? Jerome Caminada (left), an investigator in Manchester during the 19th century, may have been the inspiration behind Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's hero, Sherlock Holmes (depicted, right, by Benedict Cumberbatch)

He gained notoriety as a police officer in the city, before rising to national fame in the mid 1880s - shortly before Sherlock Holmes made his debut in A Study in Scarlet in 1887.

Now, a biography of Caminada, published this month, reveals the Victorian investigator may have helped inspire Doyle's creation of Holmes.

'Caminada became a national figure at just the time that Sherlock Holmes was being created,' author Angela Buckley told The Sunday Telegraph.

'There are so many parallels that it is clear Doyle was using parts of this real character for his.'

Similar plotlines: One of the most prominent similarities between Caminada and Holmes was their fascination with an attractive female criminal - notably, Irene Adler in Holmes's case.  And both investigators had an arch-enemy, like Professor James Moriarty.

Mrs Buckley, a historian and trustee 
of the Society of Genealogists, said Caminada, like Holmes, had used an 
array of unorthodox methods to capture criminals.

These
 included prowling the streets at night, wearing elaborate disguises and
 maintaining an extensive network of informers, whom he would meet in a 
back pew of a church.

Jerome Caminada rose to national fame in the mid 1880s - shortly before Sherlock Holmes made his debut in A Study in Scarlet in 1887.

Like Holmes, he boasted an array of unrivalled skills, including those of logical reasoning and deduction, the mastery of eccentric disguises and an ability to capture even the most talented of criminals.

And the similarities do not stop there.

The pair also:

He
 also had an in-depth knowledge of Manchester's criminal underclass - 
similarly to Holmes's ongoing contact with figures in the underworld, 
the Baker Street Irregulars, she said. 

Born in Manchester in 1844, Caminada worked as an engineer in the city, before joining Manchester City Police Force in 1868.

He later worked, like Holmes, as a 'consulting detective' on cases across the country - donning a number of skilled disguises, including a labourer, a drunken lout and various working-class roles.

Dubbed 'the Garibaldi of Detectives', he was reportedly responsible for imprisoning a staggering 1,225 criminals - and was reputedly even able to spot a thief simply by the way he walked.

Mrs Buckley said one of the most prominent similarities between Caminada and Holmes was their fascination with an attractive female criminal - notably, Irene Adler in Holmes's case.

Caminada's own experience saw him track down Alicia Ormonde - a seemingly well-educated, artisocratic woman who was actually a consummate forger and crook - before apparently becoming infatuated by her.

He also formed a nemesis called Bob Horridge, a violent career criminal with a number of similarities to Holmes's arch-enemy Professor James Moriarty, a mathematics professor-turned-criminal.

The pair had a 20-year feud, before Caminada tackled Horridge in final, dramatic confrontation, where he managed to pull out his revolver a fraction faster than his enemy.

The Manchester investigator died in 1914 at the age of 70 - the year the final Holmes book was set.

Legend: Sherlock Holmes, created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (left), starred in four novels and 56 short stories

In the past, other people have been put forward as the inspiration for Holmes, who featured in four novels and 56 short stories and is most recently portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch in the BBC series, written by Steven Moffat.

In an interview, Doyle said he had taken inspiration from Dr Joseph Bell, a surgeon at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, who was known for drawing large conclusions from small observations.

Meanwhile, Sir Henry Littlejohn, a former police surgeon, has also been cited as an influential figure.
