A lavish mansion on an exclusive beachfront has been turned into a drug rehabilitation clinic angering its wealthy neighbours.

Addiction specialists TLC Recovery have turned the 7,000-square-foot palatial home on the Intercoastal Waterway in Deerfield Beach, South Florida into a dry-out center for those battling with drugs and alcohol.

The company has posted a gallery of pictures on the company website of the mansion offering counsellors' knowledge and support in an 'environment... unmatched in luxury'.

Welcoming: Prices are undisclosed for stays at the TLC Recovery mansion but the average guest remains for three months

In their philosophy, TLC cares for only a small number of patients helping them come through their problems and 'maintain a successful life of addiction free living'.

The property offers a small number of separate bedrooms for all residents which were remodelled in 2009. Guests stay for a minimum of 90 days but prices were undisclosed. 

Also available on the site was a home cinema, pool and jacuzzi overlooking breathtaking coastline.

A full-time professional chef can 
prepare food for guests throughout the day with beaches, jogging paths 
and a golf course all nearby.

Home sales in Deerfield Beach have declined steadily in the last six years along with the asking prices, according to city data.

Deerfield Beach has laws banning more than three 
unrelated adults from living together in a single-family home, according to local authorities.

However those battling 
addictions were protected under the federal Fair Housing Act - which 
overrules local by-laws.

City Manager Kevin Klopp told the 
Sun-Sentinel that although residents had brought complaints to him and 
were planning a rally, the home legally cannot be stopped from opening.

In treatment centers like the one at Deerfield Beach, a group of recovering addicts 
lives 'as a family,' TLC's lawyer James Green told the Sun-Sentinel.

Deerfield is a thriving city of 50,000 residents where the economy is driven by tourism. It plays host to the Women’s Professional Volleyball Association Tour and Superboat Power Race.
