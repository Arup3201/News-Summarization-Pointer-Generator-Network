Modern life and its trappings - financial crisis, war, the threat of terrorism and global warming - leaves many hankering after the good old days. And, according to new research, with good reason.

Scientists have discovered that despite an overabundance of polyester flares and bouffant hair, 1978 was the year that the world's quality of life peaked, after which it has gradually deteriorated ever since.

Australian experts used a novel method to track the social and economic progress of the world, taking into account various economic, lifestyle-related and ecological factors to come to their conclusion.

Happier Times? Australian scientists used a novel method to track the social and economic progress of the world, taking into account various economic, lifestyle-related and ecological factors to come to their conclusion that 1978 was the best year

Until recently the standard method of 
measuring progress in a society was by assessing its Gross Domestic 
product (GDP) - basically a measure of all the money spent and earned in
a given society.

But, as 
the new study explained, this has its limits, and can in fact give an 
inaccurate perspective on the happiness of the planet.

Quality of life: The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) uses economic data as well as statistics relating to pollution, housework and car accidents among other factors. The researchers found that GPI peaked in globally in 1978 and has steadily declined since then

'GDP was never designed to measure social or economic welfare, and yet, today, it is the most commonly used indicator of a country's overall performance,' the study, led by Dr Ida Kuniszewski and Dr Robert Costanza of the University of Canberra's Crawford School of Public Policy, said.

It went on to explain that the most major issue with GDP is that it interprets every expense as positive.

Experts at the University of Canberra found that while global GDP - a measure of a economic progress - has increased (shown in green) over time, a more complex measure taking quality of life into account, called GPI (pictured in purple), in fact peaked in 1978 and never recovered

So, for example, an oil spill would be interpreted as a boost to GDP because large sums of money would be spent to mount a clean-up operation.

They explained that 'the [enjoyable] act of picking vegetables for your own garden and cooking them for family or friends does not fall into GDP.

'Yet buying a similar meal in a frozen food aisle involves spending money and a in turn results in a GDP increase.'

Popular culture: In 1978 Rod Stewart enjoyed a number one with single 'Do Ya Think I'm Sexy' and actress Farrah Fawcett (right) was one of the most desirable women in the world

They said that a more accurate measure of how a society is faring would need to take a variety of factors - including economy, the state of the environment, and society -  into account

One alternative measure - and the one they used - is called the Genuine Progress Indicator. (GPI).

GPI starts by using the same figures as GDP, but uses 24 other factors including crime rates, pollution levels, loss of wetland, car accident rates and even the amount of people who volunteer and enjoy housework to give a country its rating.

The study analysed data collected between 1950 and 2003 and followed 17 countries - equating to half the world's population - to come to their conclusion.

They found that on average, where GDP steadily increased without interruption, GDI peaked in 1978 and has tapered off ever since.

The 1970s economic crisis, Edward Heath's social policy, unemployment and austerity all contibuted to a sudden dip in the UK's GPI. The country has never reached the high of 1978 since

The U.S.'s trajectory was similar to the global picture, showing that there was a steady decline in GPI from 1978 onwards but that there has been a slight improvement since 2007

Experts said the results show that social and environmental problems have cancelled out any monetary wealth the world has accrued.

'A lot of people working in the field were pretty sure it happened, but it didn't get detected in GDP,' Jacqueline McGlade of University College London, and former head of the European Environment Agency told the New Scientist.

The study explained that the UK drop could be explained by Edward Heath's Tory government coming into power in 1970 and cutting social programmes, which continued throughout the Margaret Thatcher period.

Around 1993, as in the U.S., GPI did start to increase again, although it has never managed to return to the previous levels reached in the Seventies.

The U.S.'s trajectory was similar to the global picture, showing that there was a steady decline from 1978 onwards but that there has been a slight pick-up since 2007.

Experts said the UK dip could, in part, be put down to Tory prime minister Edward Heath's policies

The only country to break ranks and experience a perpetual rise until the data ends in 2003 is Japan.

However not all experts are convinced by the accuracy of GPI, and many do not believe it is the new yardstick by which a society should be measured.

Many believe that there can be no single method of measuring how a society is progressing because there are too many complex factors at play.

In addition to this, many say it would be foolish to believe that those in developing countries aren't, for the most part, enjoying a better quality of life - in the past 20 years alone world poverty has fallen by 42 per cent.

'If you look at the broader picture of 
things that contribute to a quality of life, I think there's no doubt 
that the average person in developing countries is better off than in 
the 1970s,' Marianne Fay, Chief Economist for the World's Bank's 
Sustainable Development Network in Washington DC, told New Scientist.

More generally, life expectancy continues to rise and many surveys in fact say that people are increasingly happy with their quality of life.

The study concluded that in order to enjoy a 'desirable and sustainable future we need to rapidly shift our policy away from maximising production and consumption (GDP) and towards improving a genuine human well-being (GPI) or similar.

'This is a shift that will require far more attention  to be paid to environmental protection , full employment, social equity, better product quality and durability.'

The study was published in Ecological Economics.

AND IN THE UK .....

The only country to have enjoyed a continually rising GPI is Japan

Some experts are sceptical about GPI and say it is not accurate to use just one formula when assessing world happiness
