It's Kim Kardashian's world - we just play in it. 

On Tuesday Kim took to Twitter to reveal what her close friend and former editor-at-large for Vogue magazine, Andre Leon Talley, would look like in digital form. 

The flamboyant fashion icon appears as a character on the reality star’s mobile phone game app Kim Kardashian: Hollywood!, looking suspiciously slimmer than usual.  

Upgrade: Andre Leon Talley is a longtime friend of Kim Kardashian speaking his mind when it comes to fashion

Close: André Leon Talley is the former American editor-at-large for Vogue magazine 

Andre will most likely be pleased with his new likeness in Kim's game, as the front-row regular has previously spoken about his long-time struggle with weight.

'The people who are really close to me and know me have stopped bringing my weight up,’ he told Vanity Fair in August 2013. ‘They probably still discuss it behind my back, some of them, in the fashion world.'

After undergoing surgery, where Andre received a lap band that has not worked, he said he no longer weighs himself.

'I do not want to get on that scale. I only know what I weigh from the way my clothes fit,' he said. 'I have never felt less of a person because of my dramatic weight gain. Up or down, my confidence and sense of self never wavered.' 

Andre is a colorful addition to the game both literally and figuratively, and has long been a friend of Kim's.

Video star: The game has ranked at or near the top of Apple’s U.S. App Store charts for the most downloaded free game

Last year Andre spoke about his time in Florence at the Kim and Kanye's wedding and didn't spare any details.

Speaking about the couple's first kiss he told Bravo's What Happened Live: 'It was extremely long which is probably a good sign. I would say there was probably tongue engagement.' 

'I think this relationship has a lot of legs,' he added, 'and I’m looking forward to the next baby, which we’ll probably call South or South West.' 

Kim released her video game in June last year and it is still in the top-15 most-downloaded apps on iTunes, so far earning her a staggering $50 million.

When developing the game, Kim wanted her family members to be a part of it because it’s supposed to be based on her life but she has also branched out to include other people that are part of her circle including Talley. 

'Beautiful
 and big!' The objective of the game is to 'create your own aspiring celebrity 
and rise to fame and fortune'

Voice over: In the game, the 33-year-old reality star used
 her talents to deliver lines such as: 'I love your style,' 'I love that 
on you,' and 'I'm so excited'

'I
 love that on you!' Kim's self-titled game app allows players to select 
clothes, hit the clubs, and 'fall in love' as house music swells in the 
background

The free game allows players to buy digital accessories for real money with $5,000 in virtual money costing $4.99 in US dollars. A pair of high heels cost about $4,000 in the game.

The objective of the game is to 'create your own aspiring celebrity and rise to fame and fortune.
