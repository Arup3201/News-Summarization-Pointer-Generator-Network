A stand-up comedian has sparked outrage for the way he reacted to an audience member's silent protest at his joke about rape during one of recent his shows in Melbourne.

Ray Badran was on stage when a woman became offended by his comments and came off her seat and sat under the table during his show, The Age reports.

Cecelia Devlin has told of how the comedian stopped his show and walked off the stage to tell her that she's 'a piece of s*** and I hope you die'.

Ms Devlin says Mr Badran's joke about looking like a rapist during his third-last act was what tipped her over the edge.

She told The Age that Mr Badran joked: 'So you know how gay people can make jokes about being gay, and black people can make jokes about being black, well I can make jokes about rape.'

When the outraged audience member staged her silent protest, Mr Badran reportedly said in the middle of his act: 'Seriously, what's this girl's problem? Oh wait, you probably shouldn't ask someone whose just called out a rape joke what their problem is.'

Ms Devlin believes Mr Badran became distracted by her actions, which prompted him to stop the show and walk up to her to say:  'Good on you for taking a stand, but you're a piece of s*** and I hope you die.' 

Those who were outraged by Mr Badran's actions took to social media and criticised the comedian

One woman agreed with Ms Devlin and couldn't see the humour in the comedian's joke about domestic violence.

'Ray Badran told a woman who felt uncomfortable about his rape joke he wished she would die. That's not exactly funny now is it?' she tweeted.

Another criticised Mr Badran for his poor response to the silent protest.

'Regardless of what the joke was (or intended to be) you can't talk like that to people. Dumb move,' she tweeted.

However a fellow comedian, Chris Wainhouse, responded to the tweets in defence of Mr Badran.

'The joke in question isn't even about rape. It was about people being being stereotyped,' he wrote.

Ms Devlin says she is seeking an apology from the comedian.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Mr Badran for comment but in a statement he issued to The Age, he said the joke is one he's been performing for two years and never received a complaint until now.

Mr Bradan further said US comedian Chris Rock praised him for the same joke during one of his previous shows. 

Mr Badran is currently staging shows at Melbourne International Comedy Festival, however it is believed the particular incident was part of an unrelated program.

It is reportedly Badran's first appearance at the festival, which runs from March 25 to April 19, where he will stage 22 shows.
