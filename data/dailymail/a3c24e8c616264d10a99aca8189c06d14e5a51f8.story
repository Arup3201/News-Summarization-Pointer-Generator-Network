A rush-hour fire in Moscow's subway today injured dozens of people, forced the evacuation of thousands of commuters and closed parts of the network.

The fire started after a power cable caught fire in a tunnel leading to the Okhotny Ryad station adjacent to Red Square, the Emergencies Ministry said in a statement.

The ministry said more than 45 people sought medical help and seven were hospitalised.
