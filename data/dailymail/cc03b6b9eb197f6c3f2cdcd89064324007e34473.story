For a nation that would usually consider the Super Bowl as the competition to decide football's world champions, the United States have come a long way in terms of the way they view 'soccer'.

This summer's World Cup in Brazil looks to be the first one that really has US fans hooked - a whole 20 years on from when they hosted the tournament on their home soil at USA '94.

For once, rather than struggling to drum up support for the USMNT (United States Men's National Team), fans are being turned away from fan parks as Americans attempt to drink in the relative successes of their national team on the big stage.

National heroes: The fans are heavily backing their team and thought they would win the World Cup

Passionate: The USMNT's players have shown passion that has inspired their supporters have in Brazil

A pre-tournament survey, carried out across 19 Brazil-bound countries, showed US supporters as fans of one of only four nations that expected their team to win the World Cup - alongside early favourites Argentina, Brazil and Spain.

While that confidence and optimism may have been slightly misguided, the US are looking good for a place in the last-16 leaving Portugal and Ghana - both considered to be stronger sides - to fail at the group stage.

A draw against Germany in their final group game would guarantee their progress to the knockout stages while a win would see them top the group and set up a potentially favourable tie against likely Group H runners-up Algeria, Russia or South Korea.

And the fans are embracing the success. Over seven years on from when David Beckham's move to LA Galaxy heralded a new era - that didn't quite work out - for soccer in the world's third largest country by population, football, as it is increasingly being referred to, is finally capturing the imagination of the fans.

Even the absence of Landon Donovan - considered a national hero in soccer terms - has not dampened the enthusiasm.

Big story: Soccer is now front page news in the states - including their 1-1 win over England in 2010

Chicago's fan park - laid on for the Portugal game - has a 15,000 person capacity but had to turn fans away, such was its popularity.

Videos of fans celebrating John Brooks' last-gasp winner against Ghana have been doing the rounds on YouTube and are on a par with videos of English fans reacting to goals - although they have had less to cheer about this year.

No country aside from the host nation took up more tickets than the USA's 196,838 for the finals while viewing figures are at an all-time high and beginning to even rival those of America's traditional sports.

While the MLS still does not quite have the same level of popularity at the USMNT - it is improving.

This year's television viewing figures were low but next year Beckham will launch his own new Miami-based MLS side, while David Villa represents arguably the States' biggest coup following his sign for Manchester City's sister club New York City FC. Chelsea legend Frank Lampard might follow the Spanish striker.

USA '94 might have been the best attended World Cup but with over 20million people watching the game against Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal on Sunday - this is the World Cup that is really drawing in Americans.

Coach Jurgen Klinnsman will face up against his home nation in the final group game - singing both anthems - and maybe the impact of the World Cup is best summed up by his gesture ahead of the Germany game.

Klinnsman has penned a letter for fans to print out and hand in at work to help them get the day off for what he calls 'for an important cause'. For supporters in the US, real football is finally becoming important.

USA fans erupted in fan parks and bars when John Brooks scored the winner against Ghana but despaired when Cristiano Ronaldo set up Silvestre Varela to equalise for Portugal and deny them qualification after two games.

A win or draw against Germany would guarantee a place in the next round and might see even more emotional scenes.
