Car manufacturer Jaguar is to announce more than 1,700 new jobs and £1.5billion of investment to build a new family of small luxury cars including its first ever 4X4.

The investment is set to create up to 7,000 further jobs with UK suppliers making nearly 9,000 jobs in total to create a new generation of hi-tech lightweight but sporty aluminium cars.

Parent company Jaguar Land Rover chose the Frankfurt Motor Show to make the announcement to signal its intent to compete ‘aggressively’ with German rivals such as Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz.

Employment boost: The new range will create 1,700 jobs at Jaguar but as many as 7,000 jobs among suppliers

And with a former BMW boss at its head in Dr Ralph Speth, it claims it now knows exactly what is needed to beat the Germans in the market they dominate.

Business minister Michael Fallon said it was a clear case of putting ‘British towels on German sun-loungers.’

The boost was also welcomed by Prime Minister David Cameron as another strong sign of a growing economy.

The 1,700 new direct jobs will be at Jaguar Land Rover’s Advanced Manufacturing Facility at Solihull near Birmingham where the new cars will be built.

But JLR said it will also ‘significantly increase’ spending with suppliers, sparking more jobs.

Jaguar says its radical new ‘crossover’ will be just one of a brand new ‘family’ of  smaller and more affordable luxury cars that will give German rivals a real run for their money as the firm significantly ramps up production.

The new Jaguar sports utility vehicle is to be built in the UK using a radical new all-aluminium flexible manufacturing system.

Jaguar says its dramatic leap into new segments will allow it to massively increase production by creating a new series of smaller and medium sized spin-off cars designed to take on German rivals such as Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz.

Experts say it will put parent company Jaguar Land Rover on track to more than double production  from around 360,000 a year today to around 750,000 by 2020 with some even suggesting a million over a decade. The company itself declines to predict volumes.

 But Jaguar Land Rover chief Executive officer Dr. Ralf Speth said: ’Today’s announcement signals Jaguar Land Rover’s ambitions to push the boundaries and redefine premium car ownership.

'At Jaguar Land Rover we place the customer at the heart of everything we do and the introduction of a world class all-new aluminium vehicle architecture means we will be more competitive, flexible and efficient delivering exciting new products for our customers around the world.’

He added: ‘Jaguar Land Rover is a business driven by design, technology and innovation and this investment and level of job creation is yet further evidence of our commitment to advancing the capability of the UK automotive sector and its supply chain.’

The 1,700 new jobs at the Solihull site in the Midlands will bring the total number of UK manufacturing jobs announced by Jaguar Land Rover over the last three years to almost 11,000.

 Business Minister Michael Fallon, who is attending the Frankfurt show, welcomed the Jaguar Land Rover announcement. 

He said: ‘It’s a great boost for jobs, investment and new models. British car-makers are flying the flag in Germany. We have our British towels on their sun-loungers.’

Business Secretary Vince Cable added: 'Jaguar Land Rover has been experiencing great success over the last couple of years but this ground-breaking project takes Jaguar onto the next level.

'This all aluminium architecture project typifies the type of innovative and high value research and development that the UK excels in and Government is supporting through the automotive industrial strategy.’

 A prototype of the new four-door Jaguar SUV - codenamed C-X17 was unveiled on the eve of the Frankfurt motor show in Germany and will be just one of a new line of cars – all based around the same hi-tech all-aluminium lightweight chassis, almost all of it from recycled metal.

However, the very first model off the line using the new flexible chassis  ‘architecture’ will be a high volume ‘baby Jaguar saloon car built at its Solihull factory in Birmingham from 2015 to take on BMW’s top selling 3-series.

The sports utility vehicle being shown at Frankfurt is set to follow two years later.
