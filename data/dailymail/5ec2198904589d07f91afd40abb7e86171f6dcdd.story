Ruby Tandoh has admitted she thinks The Great British Bake Off is 'crap TV' and that women who watch it are 'silly'

It is the popular TV show that turned her into a household name and saw her go from philosophy student to baking star in a matter of weeks.

But Ruby Tandoh has admitted she thinks The Great British Bake Off is ‘crap TV’ and that women who watch it are ‘silly’.

It is a surprising revelation for the baker, 21, who won an army of fans while Bake Off was on screens.

And for a long time she was the odds-on favourite to win before being unexpectedly beaten by Frances Quinn in the final. 

Then of course there was Miss Tandoh’s evident passion for the programme, which saw her break down in tears almost every episode out of apparent frustration at her under baked cakes or soggy bottoms.

All of that, however, seemed to go out of the window on Monday night as Miss Tandoh joined a panel of women to debate whether feminism needs a rebranding.

And she launched a startlingly scathing attack on the programme.

She said: ‘Collectively we’re [women in general] all a bit silly. I cried over the John Lewis Christmas advert, we like get so excited when the Starbucks red cups come out. We watch crap on TV like Bake Off. We like things we can latch onto and understand quite clearly.’

She added: ‘This isn’t about dumbing down feminism or making it more girly or softer or diluting any of these messages. And I don’t want you to compromise any of those goals. But I just think we need to change our meanings, make it more inclusive, make it less epidemic.’

It comes after Miss Tandoh surprised fans of the popular programme, which recently announced its move from BBC2 to BBC 1, by branding herself a feminist as she hit back at accusations she had flirted with co-host, baker Paul Hollywood,  and sobbed her way into the final.

And as she spoke at the east London debate, which was chaired by Elle Magazine editor-in-chief Lorraine Candy, she addressed the ‘unfortunate’ stereotype that prevails about feminists as ‘angry hairy women’.

She said: ‘A lot of people were surprised I identified myself as a feminist. Even though within academic feminism and journalism context, we assume feminism is the right way to go, I think we take for granted everyone feels that way.

'Everyone doesn’t think that way. People still think that feminists are angry hairy women. That is a stereotype that prevails, unfortunately.’

As the final of Bake Off  loomed earlier this year,  fans appeared to turn on Miss Tandoh and accused her of ‘flirting’ with baking judge Paul Hollywood – something both Hollywood and Miss Tandoh have both fiercely denied.

Viewers were also damningly critical of her tendency to burst into tears episode after episode.

And true to form, as Miss Quinn was crowned Bake Off winner, Miss Tandoh had a little sob and was later seen in a pub where she pledged to get ‘absolutely trolleyed’ and drown her sorrows.
