A baby died after an ambulance driver on her first shift struggled to find the child’s home – and then took a wrong turning on the way back to hospital.

Amy Carter called 999 after her three-month-old daughter Bella suffered a fit and stopped breathing.

But the ambulance took nearly half an hour to reach them because the driver – who was relying on a satnav – got lost.

Fearing the same thing could happen on the way to hospital, the frantic mother yelled directions from the back of the ambulance, but the driver went round a roundabout twice before taking a wrong turn.

When three-month-old Bella Carter suffered a fit and stopped breathing, her mother Amy frantically dialled 999. But the ambulance crew failed to arrive for 26 minutes and she was dead upon arriving at hospital

By the time they arrived at hospital, Bella had not been breathing for nearly an hour and was pronounced dead.

Last night, Miss Carter, 24, of Thetford, Norfolk, said: ‘If they had got to her in time she would be alive today.’

She said that when she called the 
ambulance, she gave clear instructions that they lived in a new house, 
in case that led to problems finding it.

The ambulance took 26 minutes to arrive – more than three times the target response time.

On their way to the West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds, Miss Carter gave directions from the back of the ambulance.

The ambulance driver attending to Bella - on her first-ever shift as a paramedic - then took a wrong turning on the way to West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds

She said: ‘They had a satnav, but it 
was taking them the long way round. Anyone who knows the area would know
to go on the bypass.

‘I was shouting directions, but it was
like I wasn’t even there.’ The grieving mother said when she had called
the ambulance on two previous occasions, unrelated to Bella’s fit, 
paramedics arrived in minutes.

Miss Carter, who lives with her lorry 
driver partner Scott Hellings, 24, said: ‘The people who were meant to 
help failed Bella. I live on a new development, but I gave the operator 
clear instructions.

By the time the ambulance arrived at West Suffolk Hospital, Bury St Edmunds, Bella had stopped breathing for nearly an hour and there was nothing doctors could do to save her

‘It is not hard to find and they had 
managed it twice before.’ She said she had told them all the doors to 
the house were open so she could remain upstairs with her sick child 
when they arrived.

Bella's mother Amy Carter is devastated by the loss of her daughter

‘But the paramedics just kept ringing and ringing on 
the bell,’ she said.

‘I didn’t want to leave Bella, but I had to abandon her and run down and back up two flights of stairs to let them in.’

Miss Carter claims the crew then made 
jokes instead of devoting all their attention to her daughter. She said:
‘They just talked about what they did at the weekend and complained 
about their knees and being old when they knelt down on the floor. I 
don’t think they knew how to deal with me.’

Miss Carter, who has a son aged four, 
said her daughter’s death has left her so distressed that she is unable 
to see other babies.

‘I would not wish this pain on my 
worst enemy,’ she said. ‘Two of my family members have just had babies 
and I have not been able to go and see them.’

Ambulance bosses have met the family 
and admitted failings in the tragedy, which happened on March 11. Local 
Tory MP Elizabeth Truss said: ‘For the ambulance to take so long to 
arrive is of serious concern.’

The East of England Ambulance Service Trust last night declined to comment. An inquest has been opened and adjourned.
