Keeping his promise: Senator Ted Cruz has formally renounced his Canadian citizenship - clearing his path for a potential presidential run in 2016

Republican U.S. Senator Ted Cruz has formally renounced his Canadian citizenship - clearing his path for a potential presidential run in 2016.

The 43-year-old vowed to give up his dual Canadian-U.S. citizenship after discovering his status on his birth certificate last August.

Now, 10 months later, he has finally fulfilled his promise, according to his spokesman, Catherine Frazier.

Ms Frazier said Mr Cruz's action became official on May 14, but he only received written confirmation at his house in Houston yesterday.

She added that the Texas Senator 'is pleased to have the process finalised'. 

'Being a U.S. Senator representing Texas, it makes sense he should be only an American citizen,' she said via email.

It comes amid speculation that Mr Cruz could make run at the White House in 2016.

However, the Republican, 
who has made frequent trips to Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, 
the first three states to hold presidential contests, has refused to say
 if he plans to run for president.

Mr Cruz was born as 'Rafael Edward Cruz' in Calgary, Alberta, in 1970, where his parents were 
working in the oil business.

His mother, Eleanor, is from the 
U.S., while his father, Rafael, is a Cuban who did not become an American citizen until 2005.

Although he has been in office only around 18 months, Mr Cruz helped lead last 
year's partial government shutdown and has become a conservative 
grass-roots champion.

The Senator discovered his dual citizenship after releasing his birth certificate to the Dallas Morning News last August amid questions about his eligibility to be president should he decide to run.

At the time, he said he was surprised to learn he was a Canadian-U.S. citizen.

He promised to formally give up the citizenship, but months passed before he eventually hired an immigration attorney to help him with the process.

In her email, Ms Frazier provided a copy of Mr Cruz's Certificate of Renuniciation, which certifies that he 'has formally renounced Canadian citizenship and pursuant to the Citizenship Act will cease to be a citizen'.

According to the U.S. Constitution, only a 'natural-born citizen' may be president.

However, legal scholars have generally agreed that the description covers foreign-born children of U.S. parents. 

President: Some Conservatives have claimed President Barack Obama was born in Kenya, and thus, was not eligible to become U.S. president. Mr Obama is a U.S. citizen; his father was Kenyan, his mother American

Previous foreign-born Americans - 
notably Republicans John McCain and George Romney - have run for 
president with some mention, but no serious challenges, of their 
eligibility.

Meanwhile, some Conservatives have claimed President Barack Obama was born in Kenya, and therefore, was not eligible to become U.S. president.

Mr Obama is a U.S. citizen - his father was Kenyan, his mother American.
