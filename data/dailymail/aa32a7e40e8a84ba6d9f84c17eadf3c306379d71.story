A hi-tech ‘glowstick’ has created some of the most astonishing light paintings ever seen - and is set to go on sale so anyone can make their own.

The pixelstick, created by New York team Bitbanger Labs, has become a huge success just days after launching on Kickstarter.

The $300 (£186) stick has 198 LED lights controlled by an on board computer.

Pixelstick consists of 198 full color RGB LEDs inside a lightweight aluminum housing.

Pixelstick’s brain, a small mounted box, reads images from an SD card and displays them, one line at a time.

Each LED corresponds to a single pixel in the image.

The images themselves can be from one to 198 pixels tall and many thousands of pixels wide.

Light painting is a photographic technique in which exposures are made by moving a hand-held light source, such as the pixelstick, through the air.

It can also be created by moving the camera through the air. The technique requires a slow shutter speed, usually a second or more.

'Lightpainting involves thinking creatively and trying outlandish ideas in the pursuit of amazing pictures,' its creators say.

'Pixelstick broadens the horizon of what's possible.'

The stick can use images created in software such as Photoshop, and can even create animations using multiple exposures.

The stick has already raised over $275,000  via crowdfunding site Kickstarter and its creators, Duncan Frazier and Stephen McGuigan say they have been astonished by the response.

'We suspected that pixelstick was something people would be interested in, simply because we've had such good results with it ourselves, but we certainly didn't foresee this kind of response,” they said.

'We're utterly amazed at the response pixelstick has gotten so far.'

The first pixelsticks are expected to be released in early 2014.
