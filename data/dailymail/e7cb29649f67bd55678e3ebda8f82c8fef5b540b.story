Bayern Munich's David Alaba is nearing a move to Real Madrid after his father and agent George met representatives of the Spanish club in Vienna, according to Marca.

Alaba signed a new deal with Bayern in December 2013 that is supposed to keep him in Germany until June 2018, but the 22-year-old appears to be eager to move to Spain.

Bayern consider Alaba to be worth at least £29.5million, and Real would have to spend big for him.

Fellow Spanish newspapers AS and Sport splash on Alvaro Morata and the Copa del Rey cup final

Fellow Spanish newspaper AS, meanwhile, are reporting Juventus striker Alvaro Morata is 'in the starting line-up against Ukraine'. 

Morata slammed Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti for leaving him on the bench without an explanation last season before his move to Italy.

The Spaniard left Madrid last summer and joined Serie A champions Juventus in search of first team football, and has scored seven goals in 22 appearances.

Morata's comments have been replicated in Italian newspaper Tuttosport, who quote him as saying: 'I love Juve more than Real. I am doing very well at Turin. I can't think about returning to Madrid - it would be a lack of respect. [Real manager Carlo] Ancelotti did not consider me.'

Sport are reporting the Nou Camp will host the Copa del Rey final between Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao because 'of its high capacity'. Both teams are understood to have 40,000 tickets allocated.
