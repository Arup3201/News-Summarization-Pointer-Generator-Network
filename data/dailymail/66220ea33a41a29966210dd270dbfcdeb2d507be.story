A young soldier hanged himself the day after the funeral of a fallen comrade whose killer he shot dead, an inquest heard yesterday.

Ryan Ward, 20, had gunned down an Afghan policeman who had killed two of his colleagues in a 'shocking and horrible' ambush.

He had later gone to pay his last respects to Sgt Gareth Thursby, 29, at his funeral in Skipton, just 24 hours before his own death, the hearing was told.

Sgt Thursby died alongside Private 
Thomas Wroe, 18, manning a checkpoint in the Nahr-e Saraj district of 
Helmand Province on September 15 last year.

A rogue Afghan policeman pretended to be injured in the road so they would help him, but then opened fire on the pair.

Kingsman Ward reacted swiftly and 'appropriately' by killing the Afghan police officer.

It
was one of a string of 'blue on green' incidents where police officers,
supposedly loyal to the Afghan government, have instead turned their 
guns on British soldiers.

Kingsman
Ward, who served in Alma Company, 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment,
had gone to the funeral of Sgt Thursby on October 26.

The next day he was found hanged by his mother at the family home in Kendal, Cumbria.

But the inquest at Kendal Magistrates' Court heard his death was 'inexplicable' as Kingsman Ward had shown little, if any, signs of distress at what had happened in Afghanistan.

Kathryn Ward said her son appeared himself and did not talk about the incident when he returned to the UK in October last year, and it 'never entered my head' that he may take his own life.

Hours before his death he had spoken to an Army colleague via Facebook to arrange meeting up and had bought some new army boots.

And there was nothing troubling him financially or in his private life with girlfriends, the hearing was told.

The inquest heard Private Ward had been deployed to Afghanistan in April and that he 'thrived in his job' (file picture)

Major Finlay Bibby told the inquest Kingsman, or Private, Ward had deployed to Afghanistan in April and that he 'thrived in his job' before giving details of the fatal incident in Helmand.

He said: 'It was a shooting that took place that he witnessed, of two of our soldiers that subsequently died, and Ryan reacted by shooting the shooter.'

Maj Bibby told the court Kingsman Ward went through a process of risk assessment, monitoring and interviewing to assess his response to what he had witnessed and done.

He had also gone to Cyprus with other soldiers on the way back to the UK for a period of 'unwinding' and 'decompression' with a 'day on the beach' and beers with his colleagues, the Major said.

'There were no signs,' he added, 'in fact there were positive signs, he talked about re-deployment.'

But Kingsman Ward's father, Richard Ward, told the inquest of an incident just a month before his son's death, which suggested some problems.

He said: 'He showed signs he was stressed, I have never seen that before, since he was a young lad, arms behind his back, shuffling, looking at the floor.'

Mr Ward said he asked his son how he was feeling and told him he had to 'be strong' and 'shake it off'.

'He put his hands around me and gave me a kiss,' Mr Ward added.

'He was absolutely in my opinion stressed out. He hugged me and said, "Thanks Dad."'

Mr Ward said his son's mood appeared to improve in the following weeks and agreed he found his death a 'shock and surprise'.

'There's just no explanation,' he added.

'It is different from a suicide because the decision to end it all is just not capable of being seen from the evidence heard'

- Coroner Ian SmithÂ 

Ian Smith, coroner for South and East Cumbria, said: 'He was involved in a truly shocking and potentially traumatic incident in Afghanistan. He did his role apparently admirably. He did what he should have done and did not crack up under the stress of that truly shocking incident he was involved in.

'The Army took appropriate measures afterwards.

'There is certainly no expectation he might self-harm, and yet he did.'

Mr Smith said he would record a verdict that Kingsman Ward died as a consequence of his own actions - not a suicide.

He added: 'He did what he did, but we have no idea why he did it or what his intentions were.

'I'm not going to infer intentions, there would have to be a clear note, there's nothing of that at all. It is different from a suicide because the decision to end it all is just not capable of being seen from the evidence heard.'

He told Kingsman Ward's parents: 'I'm sorry I can't answer what was going through your son's mind, but nobody will ever know I'm afraid.'
