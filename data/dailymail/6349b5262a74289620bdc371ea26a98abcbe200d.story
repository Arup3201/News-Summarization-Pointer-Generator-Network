Craig Stockham, 33, was jailed for 16 months after stealing £30,000 in just nine months from two non-profit leisure companies in Warrington, Cheshire

A finance boss has been jailed after stealing £30,000 in nine months to feed his £150-a-day cocaine habit.

Craig Stockham earned £52,000 a year as director of two non-profit council leisure companies in Warrington, Cheshire, and was in charge of managing budgets and making payments.

But the 33-year-old, from Flintshire, North Wales, was suspended on his last day of work after checks revealed irregularities in payments he had authorised.

An earlier court hearing was told he stole thousands  from LiveWire and Culture Warrington between January and November last year before using it to fund his cocaine habit.

He was able to disguise their true destination by creating fake invoice templates and using the names of legitimate companies to mask his deceit. 

Stockham had been working at the organisations since May 2012 and was later promoted to financial director in April 2014, a court heard.

Alarm bells were raised when one of his colleagues carried out some checks after spotting a payment of £600 to Thompson FM in Flintshire on November 7.

The company was not based in Flintshire and further investigations revealed that the sort code and account number matched those of Stockham's personal account.

The police were alerted and he was arrested on November 12 where he was frank about his catalogue of stealing.

Prosecuting at Warrington Crown Court, Paulinus Barnes, said: 'He admitted the theft straight away and said his offending had spiralled out of control due to his £150 a day coke habit.'

Stockham, who pleaded guilty to the charges on December 30 at Halton Magistrates Court, also stated that he did not know how much he had taken, but was later revealed to be £29,169.

In a victim impact statement, managing director, Jan Souness described Stockham as a once charismatic and popular member of staff but this changed in 2014.

Stockham - who was one of the company's highest-paid earners - started to act erratic, his appearance became dishevelled and his work became disorganised, a court was told.

This gave senior leaders no option other than to ask Stockham to leave the company on November 6 along with a severance payout of £18,000. But the next day his stealing spree was uncovered.

Defending, Michael Davies, said he was remorseful for his actions and that he has offered to immediately pay back £10,000 after his parents agreed to loan him the money.

But no order was made for Stockham to repay the money in full.

The court also heard how Stockham had managed to secure a £200-a-week job selling credit cards following his arrest.

His current employer, Matthew Stewart, said he had been 'open and honest about his offences'. 

He added that if he could continue with the company he was likely to see his earnings increase considerably.

His previous boss, Gary Ferguson, also described his actions as 'out of character'.

Sentencing at Warrington Crown Court yesterday, Recorder Paul O'Brien said his actions were a clear 'breach of trust' which only an immediate custodial sentence would suffice, and sentenced him to 16 months in prison.

But he added: 'It is clear that you have demonstrated some remorse and offered to pay recompense.'

Stockham, who was dressed smartly in a suit, hung his head in shame throughout the proceedings before he was led down to the cells to start his sentence.

Managing director of LiveWire and Culture Warrington Jan Souness said the 16 month sentence reflects the seriousness of his offence.

It also takes into account the personal impact it has had on both the board members and staff working in LiveWire and Culture Warrington to provide services for the people of the town.

She said: 'The team and I were devastated when his actions first came to light, however, we worked resiliently with our board, our bank, insurers and external auditors in order to gain full clarity of the situation.

'Thankfully this work revealed that our procedures and in-house processes are robust and that it was this, along with staff vigilance that led to the discovery of these issues in a timely manner.

'I can also confirm that we are insured against the theft that has occurred.

'We are a strong team and we have come together in managing this difficult situation, but it has been hard to come to terms with the discovery of the actions from of one of our most senior managers who was working in a job that required the highest level of integrity and trust.

'Both companies have continued to perform well during this difficult time with members and customers numbers increasing.

'We will of course continue to be diligent in terms of how we operate and at the same time look forward to the future with exciting projects on the way.'
