Details of how Myra Hindley was allowed to conduct a three-year lesbian affair with a prison warder have been revealed for the first time.

The Moors Murderer’s relationship with former nun Pat Cairns was common knowledge among staff at Holloway, files reveal.

The pair’s romance began during table tennis sessions and the child killer even knitted cuddly toys as presents for her lover.

But Hindley managed to convince the prison governor that tales of an affair were false and Cairns merely provided ‘spiritual guidance’.

When a fellow inmate reported them, Hindley convinced the governor it was a lie and the other prisoner was punished for making false allegations.

The relationship continued until a plot by the pair to spring Hindley from jail and escape together to South America was uncovered.

The warder who exposed their scheme, Heather Longhurst, told police: ‘It was general gossip that there had been association between Patricia Cairns and Myra Hindley.’

Hindley had been found in the prison chapel and escorted back to her wing by Miss Longhurst.

Another officer searched the chapel and found Cairns in a ‘very flustered’ state. Later Cairns confessed to Miss Longhurst how she had met Hindley playing table tennis on the wing and the pair, both then 27, had fallen in love.

The previously secret files have been studied by Dr Tom Clark, a Sheffield University lecturer who is researching a book about Hindley.

They reveal how Cairns and the killer had trysts in the prison chapel and exchanged more than 100 letters – with the warder posing as Hindley’s cousin.

Between 1971 and 1973 Hindley wrote 74 letters to Cairns, addressing them to ‘Glenis Moores’ – she had a cousin Glenys.

The murderer received 51 typewritten replies from Cairns, which were later destroyed.

Miss Longhurst said: ‘Cairns told me she loved Hindley more than anything else in the world. They seemed to have a perfect understanding in every way.

‘Pat showed me knitted articles in the form of animals which Myra had made for her.’ Cairns even showed her photographs she had taken of Hindley in her cell.

The affair was able to continue, not least because the governor, Dorothy Wing, had a high opinion of Hindley and even took her for walks on Hampstead Heath.

In March 1971, inmate Pat Ali was caught with a £5 note hidden inside a pen. She claimed it was a reward for acting as a go-between for Cairns and Hindley.

Hindley said these were ‘mendacious and wicked allegations’ and that Cairns had provided her with ‘considerable spiritual help’ when she asked advice about a ‘particularly painful religious struggle’.

Ali was found guilty of making a false malicious allegation against a prison officer.

Governor Wing even wrote about Hindley: ‘As a prisoner she presents herself as a very disciplined, very controlled person anxious never to transgress prison rules.’

But in November 1973 police heard rumours of a plot by Hindley to escape using forged keys.

Hindley became desperate to warn her lover and when Miss Longhurst heard talk of ‘key impressions’ she arranged to see Cairns.

Suspecting prison keys had been copied in a serious escape bid, she decided to turn her colleague in.

Cairns was jailed for six years and never saw Hindley again. Hindley continued to write to her until 1976. Her letters were returned unread.

Hindley, who with Ian Brady tortured and murdered at least five children in Manchester in the 1960s, burying their bodies on Saddleworth Moor, died in Cookham Wood prison in 2002, aged 60.

Her prison records were originally intended to be sealed for 100 years, but were released into the national archives after her death.

Cairns assumed a new identity on release from prison and moved to a spot near the moors, close to where Hindley’s ashes were scattered.
