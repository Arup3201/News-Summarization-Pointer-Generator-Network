Should he stay or should he go? Half of voters believe George Osborne should be sacked as Chancellor

Half of voters want George Osborne sacked as Chancellor in a new poll showing he is now the Government's most disliked politician.

Mr Osborne has taken over from beleaguered Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg at the bottom of a damning popularity league that ranks how much the public like the cabinet.

The Deputy Prime Minister has a rating of minus 26 compared to his Treasury colleague's minus 32, the Guardian/ICM study found.

Meanwhile, 48 per cent of these voters believe Mr Osborne should be ousted from No 11 but that rises to 52 per cent among pensioners and 53 per cent for the 35 to 64 age group.

David Cameron is preparing to reshuffle his cabinet and he could decide that his friend should swap places with Foreign Secretary William Hague.

The Prime Minister is taking time on holiday in Cornwall to consider what moves to make.

Meanwhile this new poll found Mr Osborne's support within his own party is split evenly.

Partnership: David Cameron could ask Foreign Secretary William Hague to swap with George Osborne but sources claim this is unlikely

Conservatives are divided over his 
performance with 44 per cent believing he is doing a bad job and 43 per cent saying he
is doing a good job.

The partnership formed between David Cameron and his Chancellor George Osborne is a strong one.

They are so close they made one another godfathers to each other's children.

Mr Osborne was campaign manager for David Cameron's leadership campaign in 2005.

In 2009 the Prime Minister was asked if he would sack his friend if things were going badly, despite their firm friendship.

'With George, the answer is yes,' he said, 'He stayed in my shadow cabinet not because he is a friend, not because we are godfathers to each other's children but because he is the right person to do the job. I know and he knows that if that was not the case he would not be there.'

But this month he ruled it out.

'George Osborne is doing an excellent job in very difficult circumstances and he has my full support in going on doing that job,’ he said.

Asked if that meant Mr Osborne would still be in place in 2015, the scheduled time of the next election, he replied: ‘He’s not going anywhere… yes.’

Mr Osborne has faced repeated criticism for failing to kick-start the
UK's floundering economy as well as presiding over a budget that 
sparked a series of U-turns.

ICM Research interviewed 1,006 adults by telephone between August 24 and 26.

The Prime Minister is doing much better in the eyes of voters than his his old friend the Chancellor.

Two thirds of Tory supporters say he is doing a good job compared to the 25 per cent who maintain he isn't.

Only a fifth of those asked believe William Hague should be shuffled meaning that he is a prime candidate to replace Mr Osborne should he be given the push.

But despite this pressure to sack the Chancellor it is believed that Mr Cameron will not.

Firstly because he is his closest and most trusted ally and secondly Cameron subscribes to Thatcher's view that to move a Chancellor is a sign of weakness and could unsettle the financial markets.

One senior Tory told the Guardian: 'Margaret Thatcher did not have to move her chancellor in her first term because she appointed the right person in the first place.

'George Osborne only became shadow chancellor in 2005 because David Cameron turned it down on the grounds that he was too young. The prime minister is five years older than George who got the job at the age of 33. That was ridiculous.'

After Mr Osborne in the unpopularity rankings was Health Secretary Andrew Lansley, then Michael Gove, Kenneth Clarke and Jeremy Hunt, who all had at least a quarter of voters believing they should be sacked.

Overall Labour still lead the by 39 per cent to 34 per cent. While the Lib Dems are up one point to 15 per cent.
