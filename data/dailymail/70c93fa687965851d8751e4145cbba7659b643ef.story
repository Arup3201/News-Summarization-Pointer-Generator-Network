Lionel Messi may not have worn his special-edition birthday boots against Nigeria, but the ones he did lace up in Porto Alegre certainly did the job.

In the 2006 and 2010 World Cups the left-footed magician scored just once. He has four in three games this time round – a brilliant double against Nigeria taking him on par at the top of the goal-scoring charts with Brazil's prodigal son, Neymar.

First up: Lionel Messi's strike sails past Vincent Enyeama in the Nigeria goal for opening goal

The two did not hit it off in their first season together at Barcelona following the samba star's blockbuster move from Santos last summer, but they have shown their considerable individual ability for their national sides at this World Cup. 

In Vincent Enyeama, Messi was lining up against one of the few goalkeepers who has come out of a duel with the Argentina star relatively unscathed. 

At the 2010 World Cup the Nigeria goalkeeper made four world-class saves to keep Messi at bay, as Argentina edged past their African opponents 1-0 courtesy of a sixth-minute goal from Gabriel Heinze.

Those happy memories were consigned to the past after just three minutes of their rematch at the Estadio Beira-Rio.

A divine throughball from Javier Mascherano found Angel di Maria on the left side of the area. The Real Madrid midfielder flicked a shot against the post, which rebounded off Enyeama's head and back on to the post, and there was Messi, running at full pelt but still somehow able to guide a thumping finish into the roof of the net from 10 yards.

Within a minute Nigeria were level, Ahmed Musa cutting in from the left and whipping a finish inside the right-hand post. The strike, deservedly, had both Nigeria and Argentina fans on their feet.

Messi nearly got on the end of a flowing move in the 25th minute to restore his side's lead. After instigating the move himself with a driving run from the right, di Maria's sweeping cross/shot just evaded Argentina's No 10 at the back post. 

Two minutes before the break Messi forced Enyeama into a fine diving stop with a curling free kick from 35 yards. 

With his sighters set the recently-turned 27-year-old gave Enyeama no chance from a second set piece less than a minute later.

Sures hot: Messi curls home a free kick for his second goal against Nigeria in Porto Alegre

Messi won the free kick by gliding past two challenges before being chopped to the ground by Nigeria centre-back Kenneth Omeruo. There were no questions about who would take it, as Messi grabbed and placed the ball down immediately. 

He then curled the dead-ball sublimely into the top-right corner, Enyeama so bewitched by the flight of the strike that he did not even dive to stop it.

Two minutes into the second half Nigeria equalised through that man Musa, though they were not level for long as Marcos Rojo got the final touch at an Argentina corner to deflect Ezequiel Garay's header past Enyeama and make it 3-2.

Influence: Messi scored four of Argentina's five goals to help his side reach the knockout stages

With Argentina's place in the last 16 secure, Alejandro Sabella withdrew Messi in the 63rd minute, no doubt wrapping him in cotton wool as soon as he took his place on the bench. 

Argentina boast some wonderful talents in their squad, including Sergio Aguero and di Maria, but Messi is streets ahead of the pair of them. 

Their captain has scored four of his team's five goals at the tournament, dragging them into the knock-out rounds. 

If your team is going to rely on one man at a World Cup, in this kind of form you would want it to be Messi.
