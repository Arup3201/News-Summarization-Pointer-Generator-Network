Marco Reus captained Borussia Dortmund on his return to action after the ankle injury that kept him out of Germany's World Cup triumph.

Reus played 57 minutes as Jurgen Klopp's side beat Stuttgart Kickers 4-1 to advance to the second round of the DFB Pokal.

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang followed up his goal in Wednesday's Super Cup win over Bayern Munich with a double against the third division side, with Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Adrian Ramos also on target.

Return: Marco Reus captained Borussia Dortmund and played 57 minutes of their DFB-Pokal first round tie against Stuttgart Kickers, which resulted in a 4-1 win

The Super Cup came too soon for Reus, who was ruled out for three months with ankle ligament damage in the 6-1 warm-up friendly win over Armenia.

It meant he missed his country's triumph in Brazil but is back in time for the new Bundesliga campaign, which begins next weekend.

But Saturday's priority was progress in the Cup and Dortmund took a first-half lead at the Mercedes-Benz Arena through Mkhitaryan, who also scored against Bayern in midweek.

Lukasz Piszczek created some space down the right-hand side and his low cross was finished off by the Armenian from close range.

Kickers responded well and really should have been on level terms before the break as Elia Soriano fired wide when well-placed inside the area.

Dortmund started the second period brightly and Kickers goalkeeper Royal-Dominique Fennell turned a shot from Aubameyang onto the post.

The third tier side refused to give in, however, and the dangerous Soriano forced Mitchell Langerak to turn his shot round the post before Randy Edwini-Bonsu fired straight at the goalkeeper from inside the six-yard box.

After playing so well, Kickers shot themselves in the foot on 55 minutes when Aubameyang pounced on an underhit Fennell back pass, beat the goalkeeper and found an empty net.

Shortly afterwards, Reus was withdrawn for Sebastian Kehl, having made a solid return from his injury lay-off.  

Edwini-Bansu halved the deficit with half-an-hour remaining though he may have scored from an offside position.

The game was finally made safe when Aubameyang added his second with 12 minutes left from close range.

And Klopp's men could finally relax when Ramos raced clear a minute from time and kept his composure to score the fourth and make sure of a place in the second round draw.
