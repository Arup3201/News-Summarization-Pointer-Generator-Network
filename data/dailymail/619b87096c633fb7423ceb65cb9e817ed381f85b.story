Five bodies have now been pulled from the charred remains of an eastern Quebec seniors' home after a horrific blaze tore through the building Thursday morning, and firefighters are still searching for another 30 people feared dead.

A fire broke out around 12:30 a.m. and raged through the retirement village, trapping residents, many of whom were dependent on wheelchairs and walkers. Canada's prime minister said there is little doubt the death toll will be high in the tragic blaze.

Officials said firefighters saw and heard people in the building that they were unable to save.

'People tried to do whatever they could, but the fire was so intense that there wasn't much that could be done,' said Pascal Fillion, who lives nearby and ran outside to find a group of locals and firefighters already at the scene, trying everything to save the panicked people inside.

'I saw people crying, I saw people collapse because they were watching those people burn.'

Frozen: Firefighters continued to douse the rubble where fire destroyed a a seniors residence leaving five people dead and 30 unaccounted for in L'Isle-Verte, Quebec, Thursday

Trapped: The fire trapped terrified residents, most of them dependent on wheelchairs and walkers

Many of those unaccounted for were confined to wheelchairs and walkers and only five residents in the center were fully autonomous, said Ginette Caron, acting mayor of the small town of L'Isle-Verte, about 140 miles northeast of Quebec City.

She said some had Alzheimer's disease.

The massive fire in the three-story building broke out around 12:30 a.m. and raged through the night.

Firefighters arrived within eight minutes of getting the alarm and several fire departments in the region were called in to help. But they were unable to carry out a complete evacuation because of the intensity of the fire. About 20 residents were transported to safety.

'It was a total fire,' L'Iles-Verte fire chief Yvan Charron said.

Fillion said, for the most part, rescuers felt helpless against a fast-moving blaze with smoke so thick it was nearly impossible to approach the building.

The fire broke out in -4F temperatures, causing equipment to freeze, Charron said.

As morning dawned and the fire was brought under control, the burned section of the facility resembled a macabre ice palace, with sheets of ice and thick icicles covering the structure.

The search for the missing was still hampered Thursday night by the cold and thick ice and the fact that the building has collapsed, said Quebec Provincial police Lt. Guy Lapointe.

Lapointe said late Thursday that the search for those missing will regroup at daylight.

'We can keep some hope for those unaccounted for, but there's very little doubt that the loss of life is considerable,' Prime Minister Stephen Harper said.

Retired police officer Pierre Filion, who had a cousin and an aunt living in the residence and who lives nearby, said the tragedy had shaken the tightly knit community of 1,500 people.

'It's going to take a long time to start living normally,' said Filion whose missing relatives are both in their 70s.

Outside the building, Jacques Berube,
 70, was getting ready to hear the worst about his 99-year-old mother, 
who is blind but still mobile.

'I went near the building; the corner where her room was is burned,' he said. 'I'll just have to wait and see. I don't like it. But I don't have any choice. It's just reality.'

Parts of the Residence du Havre, which opened in 1997, had sprinklers, while others didn't.

Charron chief said sprinklers did go off, triggering the fire alarm and allowing firefighters to gain access to about one-third of the building.

Mario Michaud, who lives across the street from the building, said he witnessed the unfolding drama shortly after midnight.

'The fire had started on the second floor. I woke up my girlfriend and called 911. I saw the firefighters and they got to work. A woman on the second floor was shouting and she went out on to the balcony.

'Her son went to get a ladder but he couldn't get to her. She burned to death,' Michaud told local newspaper Info Dimanche.

At least three people survived the blaze with injuries, though the extent of these was unclear.

The building was home to more than 50 people and also housed a social agency, a pharmacy and a hair salon.

'A night in hell': A local fire chief called the combination of raging flames and bitter cold hellish

A Quebec Health Department document updated last July said the building, with one elevator, was constructed entirely of wood.

Most
 residents were older than 75 and 37 of them were older than 85. The 
building included both single rooms and apartment-style dwellings. The 
document also indicates the building was only partially fitted with a 
sprinkler system but did have a fire alarm. There were smoke detectors 
in every room and in the building itself.

The
 fire comes just six months after 47 people were killed in Lac-Megantic,
 Quebec, when a train with 72 oil tankers derailed and exploded in the 
small community.

A further 
20 people were rescued from the inferno that saw flames shooting several
 stories into the air as firefighters battled extreme temperatures 
dropping below zero.

Earlier, Fire Chief Yvan Charron described the evening as 'a night of hell' to Dimanche.

Authorities spoke Thursday of the grim reality now facing the tiny town of just over 1,500 people.

'These are elderly, some of which are
 very limited mobility,' Mr Charron added. 'Others were afraid and they 
hid under blankets.'

'Her boy, he broke down,' Mario Michaud added to the Globe and Mail. 'It wasn't pretty.'

Volunteer fire fighters from at least
 20 separate barracks responded to the blaze, according to Dimanche. 
They had to battle both the towering flames and temperatures plunging 
well below zero.

Their efforts were not able to keep the complex from completely burning to the ground.

'Some
 are still looking for their parents but we're certain that our mother 
has died,' another local told the Globe and Mail. 'She was on the 
balcony and there was too much smoke … the building has collapsed so 
she's still in the rubble.'

Authorities have said it will take several hours to sift through the charred building for victims.

Another woman was found wracked with guilt outside the blaze – she had recently placed her parents in the facility.

'I
 didn't send my parents to see them burn there,' Marielle Marquis, the 
president of a local seniors club, recalled to the Globe and Mail.

The 20 residents rescued from the 
raging fire lived in the complex’s newer east wing, the Globe and Mail 
reported. It had a firewall that blocked the flames from reaching them.

The
 building's older wing touts an automatic sprinkler system on its 
website, but official filings show it has only partial sprinklers, 
according to the Globe and Mail.

The facility was first opened in 1997, according to the Montreal Gazette.

The cause of the blaze has not yet been determined.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued a statement on the tragedy.

'On behalf of the entire country, I offer my sincere condolences to the family and friends of those who passed away following the fire at a seniors' residence in eastern Quebec,' he said.

'My thoughts and prayers are also with those who remain unaccounted for and all those who have been injured.'

Quebec Premier Pauline Marois offered her condolences from Davos, Switzerland.

'I want to extend my condolences to all the families affected by this terrible fire,' she said. 'I have been in touch with my office and we are doing everything we can to support the community and families.

'It's a private center but we're talking about human beings, so we'll do whatever we can. I am deeply saddened by this event.'

The fire comes just six months after 47 people were killed in Lac-Megantic, Quebec, when a train with 72 oil tankers derailed and exploded in the small community.

A 1969 nursing home fire in the community of Notre-Dame-du-Lac, Quebec, claimed 54 lives.
