The father of Phylicia Barnes has said the judicial system let his daughter down after a man convicted of killing the North Carolina teenager was set free.

A judge dismissed all charges against Michael Johnson, 30, on Tuesday adding the prosecution's 'arguably circumstantial' case against was insufficient evidence.

Baltimore Circuit Court Judge John Addison Howard dismissed second-degree murder and other charges against Johnson - leaving no other suspects in the case.

The State's Attorney in Baltimore has vowed to appeal the ruling.

Phylicia's father Russell said the judicial system let his daughter down and set a 'child predator' free.

Mr Barnes told The Baltimore Sun: 'In my mind, the city of Baltimore has let a child predator go.

'We still want justice for Phylicia.'

Johnson's mother, Rhonda Mullins, said the case had been a 'nightmare' for her family - and her son's acquittal was 'wonderful'.

Johnson was charged in the death of the teenager, of Monroe, North Carolina, who vanished in December 2010 while she was visiting relatives in Baltimore, Maryland.

Her body was found months later floating in the Susquehanna River.

Johnson was arrested in 2012 and charged with killing her. 

Prosecutors alleged that Johnson killed Barnes in her sister's apartment and used a 35-gallon tub to move the body.

He was convicted of second-degree murder in 2013 - but a judge ordered a new trial after ruling prosecutors withheld evidence about a key witness.

Last month, Judge Howard declared a mistrial in Johnson's second trial.

Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby said on Tuesday that the court had 'no jurisdiction to grant the acquittal'.

'I want to be clear that there was no prosecutorial misconduct in this case. 

'The court agreed there was no misconduct in its prior ruling in December, and again today.'

She added that 'the court had no jurisdiction to grant the acquittal and we will be seeking an appeal on those grounds.'

Katy O'Donnell, one of two attorneys from the public defender's office who represented Johnson, said: 'Michael Johnson has maintained his innocence from day one.

'We absolutely, firmly believe the court did the right thing and justice was done.'
