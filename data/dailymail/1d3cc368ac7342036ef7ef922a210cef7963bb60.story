Condemned: Lindsay Sandiford could be executed within weeks after Indonesia signalled its intention to resume state executions

Condemned British drug smuggler Lindsay Sandiford could be executed within weeks after Indonesia signalled its intention to resume state executions.

No one has been put to death in the country since 2008, and because of this at least 12 death row inmates believed they had avoided execution.

However, attorney general Basrief Arief has announced that death sentences will be carried out again soon.

Sources in the Indonesian province of Bali, where Mrs Sandiford, 56, is being held after being sentenced last month, have suggested her crime has led to the decision to resume executions.

She was caught smuggling £1.6million worth of cocaine through Bali airport last year.

Mrs Sandiford has to lodge an appeal by February 12 but is having difficulty in paying for a lawyer to handle the process. If the deadline is missed she must then rely on presidential mercy.

If the current 12 death row inmates are executed, they will be the first to die since November 2008 when three terrorists convicted of the 2002 Bali nightclub bombings were tied to posts in an orchard and killed by a firing squad.

That year, 10 people were executed, compared to a total of 11 in the previous decade.

Although Mr Basrief has said earlier that the respite in executions since 2008 had been due to long appeals processes, which he wanted shortened, he is also said to have been dismayed at the brazenness of drug smugglers in recent years.
