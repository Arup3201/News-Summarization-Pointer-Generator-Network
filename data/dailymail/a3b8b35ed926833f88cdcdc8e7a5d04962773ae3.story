As Muslims from 160 countries descend on Mecca for the Hajj pilgrimage, understandably the holy city is abuzz with excitement.

Scores of pilgrims gather inside the Grand Mosque  in anticipation of a religious journey that is considered one of the Muslim faith’s greatest acts of worship.

Every adult Muslim is required to complete the Hajj pilgrimage at least once in their lifetime as long as they are physically and financially capable of making the expensive and difficult journey.

Central: Pilgrims will gather around the Kaaba - the most holy point of Islam

Believers: Last year over £1.3 million Muslims made the pilgrimage to Mecca

Pilgrims wear unstitched folds of white cloth as they make the trek to Mecca’s Grand Mosque, Islam’s most sacred mosque.

And as these incredible photographs show, it's a chance for Muslims to come together as one, as well as take pride in their great act of worship.

Pilgrims will gather around the Kaaba - a cuboid building in the middle of the Great Mosque which is also known as the Sacred House.

It is this building that, wherever you are in the world, Muslims are expected to face when praying - it is the most sacred location in Islam.

Souvenir: Gold pendants, such as the Kaaba (being selected) are sold as a reminder of the act of worshjp

The week of Hajj occurs during the last month of the Islamic calendar and it requires pilgrims to perform a number of services or rituals before arriving in Mecca.

When the faithful reach the Grand Mosque, they walk counter-clockwise seven times around the  Kaaba.

Hajj, the fifth of the pillars of Islam, coincides with the Eid al-Adha festival, known as the Feast of the Sacrifice and is meant to commemorate the trials of Prophet Abraham and his family.

Memento: It will be a profitable time for shop owners during the pilgrimage
