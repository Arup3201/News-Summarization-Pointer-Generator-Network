American politicians are considering creating a $1trillion platinum coin which the US Treasury would pay to itself with the aim of reducing the country’s monumental debt.

Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has the authority to mint platinum coins in the denomination of his choosing, and experts say the idea is being taken seriously in Washington.

The proposal would involve the Treasury minting the coin and depositing it into its own account at the Federal Reserve, allowing the government to write down or cancel $1trillion of its $16.4trillion debt.

Almost 5,000 people have signed a petition for the Government to mint the special coin to help pay off its huge debt

The idea was first raised last year and is gaining momentum.

A formal petition has been started asking the White House to take the measure to avoid another high-stakes ‘fiscal cliff’ battle to raise the debt ceiling.

Economist and Nobel prizewinner Paul Krugman, one of those backing the idea, said the time had come to use any economic tools available to the Government.

Writing in his blog on the New York Times website, Mr Krugman said: ‘This is all a gimmick – but since the debt ceiling itself is crazy, allowing Congress to tell the President to spend money then tell him that he can’t raise the money he’s supposed to spend, there’s a pretty good case for using whatever gimmicks come to hand.’

The petition on the White House website – launched by someone who posted his name only as Graham K – has attracted nearly 5,000 signatures.

It needs to get 25,000 by February 3 to get a formal White House response.

It says: ‘With the creation and Treasury deposit of a new platinum coin with a value of $1trillion, we would avert the absurd yet imminent debt ceiling face-off in Congress in two quick and simple steps!

‘While this may seem like an unnecessarily extreme measure, it is no more absurd than playing political football with the US – and global – economy at stake.’

Financial analyst Cullen Roche said the idea is being taken seriously in the White House.

The Treasury has two months to solve its  financial crisis as the fiscal cliff deal reached  in Congress gives politicians until the end of February to raise the debt limit before the country defaults.
