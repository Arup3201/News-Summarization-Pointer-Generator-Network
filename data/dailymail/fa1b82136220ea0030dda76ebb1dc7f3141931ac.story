A tech guru who was accused of making 'weird and insensitive' comments about the murderous manifesto written by Santa Barbara shooter Elliot Rodger has been fired.

Rap Genius co-founder Mahbod Moghadam posted a series of bizarre annotations alongside extracts from the virgin killer's 141-page memoir, including one that speculates that Rodger's sister must be 'smokin hot'.

After the accusations, he was lambasted as being misogynistic, and it has since emerged that he was let go from the company he helped found.

'Mahbod Moghadam, one of my co-founders, annotated the piece with 
annotations that not only didn’t attempt to enhance anyone’s 
understanding of the text, but went beyond that into gleeful 
insensitivity and misogyny,' Rap Genius co-founder and CEO Tom Lehman wrote in a statement.

'Weird': Rap Genius co-founder Mahbod Moghadam (left) has come under fire for posting creepy comments about the murderous manifesto of Santa Barbara shooter Elliot Rodger

He added that this 'is contrary to everything we’re
 trying to accomplish at Rap Genius' and that Moghadam had resigned.

But sources told Recode that he had actually been fired after pressue from investors.

Rodger's chilling dossier - entitled My Twisted World - sheds light the depth of the 22-year-old's rage which was mainly targeted at young women who he blamed for that fact he was still a virgin.

Yet, in a number of posts, Moghadam praised the gunman for his 'beautiful' writing and joked about his sister.

Rap Genius is a website dedicated to the annotation and interpretation of lyrics, poetry and other forms of text.

Ilan Zechory, another Rap Genius co-founder, took issue with his colleague's comments, saying they had embarrassed the website.

In an email to Business Insider, he said: 'Mahbod's annotations... are inconsiderate, uninteresting, and insensitive. It was horrible judgment to annotate in the way that Mahbod did.

'Thankfully the Rap Genius community is much more than one person and when people put up stuff like this, it gets edited quickly. It's obviously embarrassing that it comes from a rap genius founder.'

Moghadam later gave a statement to 
Valleywag's Nitasha Tiku, which read: 'I was fascinated by the fact that
 a text was associated with such a heartbreaking crime, especially since
 Elliot is talking about my neighborhood growing up.

'I got carried away with making the annotations and making any comment about his sister was in horrible taste.

'Thankfully the rap genius community edits out my poor judgement, I am very sorry for writing it.'

The controversy came as it emerged Rodger is quickly acquiring an army of sick female fans who have come out in praise of the shooter despite his mass killing.

Perversely, many of them are from the 
very demographic - young women - that caused him to foster such growing 
hatred because of his failure to strike relationships with them in life.

Rodger carried out a deadly gun and
 knife rampage near Santa Barbara, California - killing six people and 
then apparently himself - after emailing the manifesto to his parents 
and therapist.

In
 his videos and writings, Rodger voices his contempt for everyone from 
his roommates to the human race, reserving special hate for two groups: 
the women he says kept him a virgin for all of his 22 years and the men 
they chose instead.

In one tweet, nena says: 'Such a shame. Elliot Rodger was hot.'

In another, aff man says: 'Seriously? not one UCSB chick couldn've bit the bullet and dated that hot dude with the cool car?'
