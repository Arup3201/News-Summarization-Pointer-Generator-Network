A male lorry driver has been killed and another seriously injured in a crash between three heavy goods vehicles on a dual carriageway.

The crash happened at 2am this morning on the A1 near Northallerton, North Yorkshire, blocking a key route in northern England and causing major traffic problems.

The driver who died was in a lorry carrying gas bottles that was in a collision with another wagon, carrying a combine harvester, which was parked in a lay-by on the road, police said.

Fatal: The crash happened at 2am this morning on the A1 near Northallerton, North Yorkshire, blocking a key route in northern England and causing major traffic problems

Night-time accident: The driver who died was in a lorry carrying gas bottles which was in collision with another wagon, carrying a combine harvester, which was parked in a lay-by on the road, police said

The gas bottle lorry - travelling on the northbound carriageway - was then struck by a third HGV, towing a curtain-sided trailer. The driver of this vehicle was taken to hospital with serious injuries.

Paper and office supplies were strewn on the road at the scene and police collision investigators were carrying out inquiries today.

The northbound A1 was closed completely and is not expected to reopen until late this afternoon while resurfacing work is carried out. The southbound carriageway is open.

A North Yorkshire Police spokesman said: ‘Emergency services are dealing with a fatal road traffic collision involving three heavy goods vehicles on the northbound carriageway of the A1.

‘The initial circumstances involved a HGV carrying bottled gas which collided with another heavy goods carrying a green combine harvester that was parked in a lay-by.

'The male driver of the HGV carrying bottled gas suffered fatal injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene. The male driver of the curtain side HGV was taken to hospital with serious injuries'

North Yorkshire Police spokesman

‘The HGV carrying bottled gas stopped shortly after the collision, but was then struck by a third heavy goods vehicle which was towing a curtain side trailer.

‘The male driver of the HGV carrying bottled gas suffered fatal injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene. The male driver of the curtain side HGV was taken to hospital with serious injuries.’

Traffic problems were exacerbated in the North Yorkshire area by a six-car accident on B6271 at Great Langton, which was being used at the time as a diversion route following the A1 crash.
