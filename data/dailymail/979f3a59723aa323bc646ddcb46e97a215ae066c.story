A five-metre saltwater crocodile at the Australian Reptile Park in Gosford has been given a lamb carcass to commemorate his 49th birthday.

Elvis the crocodile, once dubbed the crankiest crocodile in Australia, happily accepted the gift by snapping it up and dragging it under water for a death roll.

Crocodiles will generally drown their pray by twisting them over underwater, while the attack will also allow them to dismember the meal for easier digestion.

Elvis earned his epithet in 2011 after he broke two of his teeth on a lawnmower that a zoo employee was using in his closure.

The 500-kg croc charged at the employee then dragged the mower into the pool.

He was moved to the Central Coast in New South Wales in 2007 after attacking fishingboats in his home town of Darwin.

Park general manager Tim Faulkner said saltwater crocodiles live up to 70 years.

'We are constantly being asked how old Elvis is and when his birthday is, but because he is wild caught, it's hard to determine,' he said.

'Because it's hatching season in the Northern Territory, we decided on January 2, so that's the day we'll celebrate his birthday.'
