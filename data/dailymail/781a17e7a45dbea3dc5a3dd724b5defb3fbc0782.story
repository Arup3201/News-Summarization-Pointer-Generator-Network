Experts say new American Psychiatric Association diagnosis guidelines could reduce the number of diagnoses of autism by a third

New diagnosis guidelines for autism could reduce the number of people diagnosed by a third, researchers have claimed.

The American Psychiatric Association (APA) released the guidelines in May 2013 and experts have now argued that the changes could leave thousands of children in the U.S. without a diagnosis.

This means they would not be able to access educational support or social support.

Researchers at Columbia University School of Nursing, in New York, conducted a literature review to determine the effect of changes to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.

The study revealed that there is a 31 per cent fall in diagnoses when the new guidelines are used.

‘This study raises a concern that a medical provider diagnosing a child under the new guidelines won't find the child to be on the autism spectrum, when the same child under the old criteria might have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder,’ said lead researcher Dr Kristine Kulage.

The old manual included three distinct subgroups under the broad definition of autism spectrum disorder – autistic disorder, Asperger’s disorder and pervasive development disorder-not otherwise specified.

The revised manual eliminates these subgroups, instead establishing a more limited range of criteria for a diagnosis of autism that is designed to encompass individuals who previously would have fallen into one of the subgroups.

However, the new manual does include a new category - called social communication disorder - to diagnose individuals who have communication difficulties but lack other attributes associated with autism.

When using the new manual, there was a 22 per cent fall in the number of people diagnosed with autistic disorder and a 70 per cent fall in the number of diagnosis of pervasive development disorder-not otherwise specified.

However, there was no notable decline in the number of people diagnosed with Asperger’s disorder.

‘We are potentially going to lose 
diagnosis and treatment for some of the most vulnerable kids who have 
developmental delays,’ said Dr Kulage.

The researchers say the guidelines could leave thousands of children without the diagnosis they need to access educational and social support

‘In many instances, children require a diagnosis of ASD to receive medical benefits, educational support and social services.

The new guidelines are not thought to have a significant impact on diagnosis in the UK.

Carol Povey, Director of the National Autistic Society's Centre for Autism, said: 'Whilst the DSM is very influential, it is not the main set of criteria used in the UK, so we don’t expect that there will be any immediate changes to the way that autism and Asperger syndrome are diagnosed in this country.

'The removal of the term Asperger syndrome is concerning for some people who view the term as part of their identity and use it in their day to day vocabulary. The changes won’t prevent people from continuing to use the term to define themselves and nor should it.

National Autistic Society says the guidelines are very important but that they are not the main tool used to make autism diagnoses in the UK

'All individuals who currently have a diagnosis on the autism spectrum, including those with Asperger syndrome, will retain their diagnosis.'

People with autism tend to have 
difficulties with communication, to misread facial expressions, and to 
have difficulty making friends.

They
 may also be heavily reliant on routines, extremely sensitive to changes
 in their environment, and intensely focused on interests not 
appropriate to the social context they are in.

Symptoms vary in severity, and early diagnosis and access to treatment have been proven to result in better outcomes.
