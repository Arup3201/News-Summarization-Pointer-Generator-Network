Dee, who killed himself before police could move in on the store, also put a gun in Ezaldein's mouth during the confrontation, according to the court documents, filed in April.  

Her twin sister told a judge on April 8 that Dee, 31, also 'stabbed her jacket with a switch knife, ripped her boots and bruised her lip. [He] threw her clothes out the window and put [a] gun in her mouth'.

The application was filed a day after Dee applied for protection against Nadia's twin sister, who he claimed was trying to get him arrested and kicked out of the Army.

Both applications were denied.

Ezaldein, a seasonal worker at Nordstrom's downtown Chicago branch, was fatally gunned down by Dee at the store on Friday - her 22nd birthday - before he turned the gun on himself. 

She was rushed to hospital and placed on life support, but died on Saturday at 3:43pm, a day after her family had planned a surprise dinner for her birthday. 

Dee was declared dead at the scene. 

Ezaldein's relatives had flown in from Florida especially to surprise the University of Chicago law student for her birthday. She had taken the job so she could afford her tuition fees.

Today, a friend posted a tribute on Facebook to her.

It said: 'RIP my sweet beautiful beam of light. I won't ever forget our beautiful and pure last moment Thursday morning. You got me. You are my angel forever.

'Fly on my angel. You are the prettiest one I bet. I will miss you until I see you again. How could he take you away from me? The world needed you, I needed you. I still need you.'

The victim started dating Dee in August 2012 after meeting him through her older sister's roommate, her family members, who wished to remain unnamed, told the Chicago Tribune. 

However, in the 14 months that followed, she was repeatedly abused and beaten up, they said.

She was allegedly hesitant to report abuse because his parents were Chicago police officers.

'She thought his parents could cover it up,' one of Ezaldein's sisters said, adding that the entire family would receive constant phone calls and texts from Dee following the pair's break-up.

The store's management decided to close the branch today following the 'tragic situation that occured'

She was hospitalized after Dee shoved a handgun into her mouth in December 2013 following months of 'psychological torment' and physical abuse, her family said.

Although she subsequently ended the relationship, she and her siblings then received threatening calls from Dee on a regular basis, forcing her to change her number three times, they said.

Speaking of Friday's shooting through tears, her sister added: 'It is the worst situation ever. Our sister came up to visit her in Chicago from Florida. We made dinner. We were supposed to have fun.

'She’s the smartest person I know. She didn’t deserve to die.' 

The victim's brother told the Chicago Sun-Times that Dee used 'a lot of emotional traumatizing phrases and words' to his sister during their relationship, saying: 'It was a very strange circumstance.'

A spokesperson speaking outside on Saturday said: 'We just felt it was the right decision as a company to take this day, regroup and support our employees'

On Saturday, Nordstrom posted on its Facebook page: 'We are deeply saddened to learn that our employee who was injured in Friday evening's tragedy at our Michigan Avenue store passed away this afternoon'

At one point, Dee tried to file a restraining order against Ezaldein - who had moved to Chicago from Florida in 2009 to start studying law - but the request was denied by a judge, it is reported. 

On Friday, crowds in the upscale department store off North Michigan Avenue were sent into a panic as they heard gunshots on the second floor at around 8.30pm and hurried out of the building. 

Hundreds of shoppers were inside at the the time for the Black Friday sales. Ezaldein, originally from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was reportedly shot in the head and neck area.

The company decided to close the store on Saturday, meaning many customers hoping to catch the sales were turned away. It was due to reopen at 11am on Sunday.

A spokesperson said on Saturday: 'We just felt it was the right decision as a company to take this day, regroup and support our employees'.

Panic: The store was filled with customers at the time during the Black Market sales. Shoppers ran to all exits of the building when they heard the shots ring out

A sign in the windows said the branch would not be opening its doors due to the 'tragic situation that occurred'.  

Michelle Smith, 47, was buying purses with her daughter Krystal, 25, when they heard two gunshots. 

She told the Chicago Tribune: 'It was a pow and a pow. It was a stampede coming down the escalator.  

Authorities reiterated that no one else was in harms way and that the suspect entered the store with the intent to hurt his ex-girlfriend. However they stressed that the store was an active crime scene. 

Suzanne Nanos-Gusching was on the third floor with her daughter who was trying on a dress for a sorority formal at the University of Michigan when shots rang out. 

'We just saw people running out and they (the employees) rushed her to get dress,' he told the paper. 'They were adamant about getting us out of the building.'

Janis Tillman who was in the store at the time told NBC Chicago: 

'I was right around the corner when an eyewitness came out. I said, 'What happened?' She said, 'I saw somebody.. I saw the guy pull out a gun, shot her, and then he then shot himself.' She was shaken. Very shaken.'
