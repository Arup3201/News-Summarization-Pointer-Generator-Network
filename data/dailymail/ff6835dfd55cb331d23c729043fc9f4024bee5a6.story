A woman in labour was given an injection of a disinfectant directly into her nervous system instead of an epidural.

The Swedish mother had been admitted to hospital Malmo when the mix-up occurred last month leaving the new mother writhing in agony.

The accident happened when two containers were mistakenly switched on the morning of July 26.

A woman giving birth was given an injection of a disinfectant instead of an epidural directly into her nervous system

During an epidurals  pain killers are injected directly into the nerve canal along the spine to instantly block pain signals to the brain.

But in the mix-up the woman was given a shot of chlorhexidine - a strong chemical used to disinfect medical catheters, medical devices which are inserted into the body, reported The Local.

A week after giving birth, the woman was still at the hospital writhing in pain.

'She has extreme pain in her back, and feels something like electric jolts all the way down through her feet,' the woman's husband said.  

After two weeks under observation, the woman was finally able to return today.

We consider this extremely serious,' Anders Rehn, acting director of Skåne University Hospital, (pictured) told local paper Sydsvenskan on Wednesday

'We consider this extremely serious,' Anders Rehn, acting director of Skåne University Hospital, told local paper Sydsvenskan on Wednesday.

The hospital says it consulted a neurologist who said that the dose was so weak that the risk of lasting damage was small.

'But obviously this shouldn't happen,' Mr Rehn added.

'We have removed the containers so they cannot be switched. The chemical is no longer in the birthing clinic.'

It is not the first time this has happened to a woman giving birth.

In 2011 a 33-year-old Sydney mother was left paralysed from the waist down and suffered painful nerve damage after she was injected with a powerful skin antiseptic instead of a saline solution during an epidural.
