A little girl who would tell her soldier father jokes to try and cheer him up in Afghanistan has published a book of the one-liners they shared.

Seven-year-old Grace Franklin from Billingham, County Durham, would speak to her Army officer father, Glen, on the phone or via Skype every day of his six-month tour in Helmand Province. 

Each time they would tell each other jokes, and after coming up with so many, Grace decided to sell the collection to raise money for the Royal British Legion.

Comedian: Grace Franklin, seven, from Billingham in County Durham has published the jokes she shared with her father while he was on a tour of duty in Helmand Province, Afghanistan

Father and daughter: Grace and Glen, 44, would speak every day via Skype or on the phone and would share the one-liners each time

Grace and her father, who serves in the Royal Engineers, have raised £630 so far and the fundraiser has been awarded a special Young Person’s Award by the mayor of Billingham.

Grace explained that her mother, Jenny, and big sister, Elizabeth, would tell her jokes when her father was away that she would repeat on the phone.

Jenifer said: 'It was her idea to write the book which took more than six months and sold over 600 copies.

'I really hope my book helps anybody who is feeling a bit sad.'

The book is being sold to raise money for the Royal British Legion. Grace has already received £630 and hopes to sell thousands more copies.

Q: Why did the picture go to jail?A: Because it was framed.

Q. Why did the traffic light turn red?A. You would too if you had to change in the middle of the street!

Q. What did one elevator say to the other elevator?A. I think I’m coming down with something!

Q. What did the stamp say to the envelope?A. Stick with me and we will go places!

Q. Why did the banana go to the Doctor?A. Because it was not peeling well.

And her favourite joke? ‘What do you get if a giant monster sat on Batman and Robin? A flatman and ribbon!'

'When she said she would like to help other children with mums and dads in the forces. The joke book seemed the best way.'

Her mother, Jenny, a community fundraiser, said special mention should go to Grace’s school and all its parents and children who bought and sold many of the books.

A second book is already being planned.

'Grace worked very hard for a long time to make that book,' she said.

Her big sister, Elizabeth, 16, said: 'I’m so proud to have Grace as my little sister. She has such a big heart and is always doing things to help others.'

Grace’s joke book is available from littlebookofjokes.co.uk.
