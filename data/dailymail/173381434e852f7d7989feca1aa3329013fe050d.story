That was the most one-sided game I have ever seen. It was a complete annihilation. We thought England would be better once they stopped playing Australia but this was worse.

Give full credit to New Zealand because they produced the most complete performance I have seen in one-day international cricket.

The way Brendon McCullum led them with imaginative, attacking tactics and aggressive field placings made this a lesson for England in how to play modern one-day cricket.

Morgan described McCullum as 'the most destructive batsman in the world' after England's heavy loss

The bottom line is that England still play old-fashioned limited-overs cricket. Their default position in difficult times is still to go back to Test players, like we have seen with Gary Ballance, rather than a more attacking option.

If they keep going down that road they will keep getting bitten. They look a fearful side who were up against a team playing without fear.

It was swing bowling that did for them — orthodox swing bowling like they would have faced since they were kids. Very good swing bowling from Tim Southee, yes, but this is international cricket and opposition bowlers are allowed to swing it.

This wasn’t mystery spin or sub-continental conditions. They should have coped much better than they did.

Look at how McCullum went about it in reply. OK, he is in the form of his life and he was only chasing 123 but he came charging at England and did not let them settle. In contrast, most of our batsmen look out of nick.

I hope whoever was responsible for making those late changes to England’s team before they played Australia will sit back now and learn from this. All we are doing is going round in circles when we should have been settled.

I’m not one for always thinking that players outside the team are better than the ones in it and I’m not sure England would achieve anything from throwing Alex Hales in now. Hales should have been picked for the 50-over team as soon as he scored that World Twenty20 century in Bangladesh and he would have played 20 one-day internationals by now.

Yes, he had a few technical problems when he first played in ODIs but that’s what happens at the highest level. As it is we drop people like him before we have given them a proper chance and their confidence evaporates.

England back players in Test cricket but do not have the same principles in one-day cricket.

Tim Southee tore through England's batting order, taking 7-33 and restricting England to 123 all out

Now it is clear there is a huge gulf between what Australia and New Zealand are doing and what England are producing. So how do we close the gap in time for this World Cup?

England have got to ask why players like Hales and Ben Stokes are playing fearlessly for their counties, the Lions, and in the Big Bash but are not doing it with England. What happens to them when they get inside that England dressing room? Are they being weighed down by too many theories? It should be about the culture of a team, not endless strategies.

Eoin Morgan must look at the way his good friend McCullum is doing the job and go down that same road. And do it as quickly as possible.
