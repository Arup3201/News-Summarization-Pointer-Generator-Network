A fiery plane crash in a residential Atlanta area took the lives of two occupants Tuesday as horrified residents looked helplessly on.

Authorities didn't immediately release the names of the victims in the crash, or if there were survivors, but shocking footage from the scene makes clear no one likely escaped.

The Raytheon 390 Premier I aircraft went down in a wooded but populated area around 7pm.

Amateur video taken at the scene shows a residents scrambling helplessly around a wall of flame at the wreckage site.

Horrified
 screams can be heard, and as the camera briefly pans to the left, what 
appear to be lights of a nearby home can be clearly seen just yards from
 the horrifying wreckage.

Vine user Drew Hawkins posted a video of burning wreckage: 'Plane just crashed behind our house. Prayers appreciated.'

'Before it even hit, the house shook,' said Hawkins later told WSBTV.  'Then I heard the explosion and it shook the house even more.'

Area resident Kevin Krapp said that planes are commonly heard in the area, but Tuesday's crash was far louder.

'It looked like it was coming straight for our house, and at the last minute, dipped its wings over and it banked really hard right,' Krapp said. 'It landed a couple hundred yards away from our house, and I thought it hit a neighborâ€™s house.'

It
 remained unclear shortly after the corporate jet crashed what, if any, 
property was damaged in the neighborhood, which abuts Chattahoochee 
Trail Park in the northwest quadrant of the southern city.

Atlanta
 Fire Rescue spokeswoman Janet Ward confirmed the two deaths but did not
 elaborate as the investigation into the cause of the tragic crash got 
underway.

FAA spokeswoman 
Kathleen Bergen said the plane had taken off from Atlanta's Fulton 
County Airport and was destined for New Orleans Lakefront Airport.
