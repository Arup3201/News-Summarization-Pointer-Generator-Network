Annise Parker, the mayor of Houston, has married her longtime partner Kathy Hubbard in a sunset ceremony at a private residence in Palm Springs, California.

A small group of family and friends, including Parker's mother and Hubbard's sister, attended the service on Thursday.

The ceremony was performed by the Rev. Paul Fromberg, rector of St. Gregory of Nyssa Episcopal Church in San Francisco.

The couple chose Thursday as their wedding date because it was the 23rd anniversary of the beginning of their relationship.

When she was elected in 2009 Parker became the first openly gay Mayor of any major US city

'This is a very happy day for us,' Ms Parker said in her statement. 'We have had to wait a very long time to formalize our commitment to each other.

'Kathy has been by my side for more than two decades, helping to raise a family, nurture my political career and all of the other ups and downs and life events that come with a committed relationship.

'She is the love of my life, and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life married to her.'

Rev Fromberg is a gay priest who had been rector of St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Houston before leaving for San Francisco.

Ms Parker's election in 2009 made Houston the largest U.S. city with an openly gay mayor. While California allows gay people to marry, Texas does not recognize same-sex marriages.

According to the mayor's statement, Ms Hubbard will avail herself of other insurance options 'and will, therefore, not participate in the new policy granting city health insurance benefits to spouses of legally married city employees.'

Ms Parker has previously stated that she wanted to get married in Houston, but acknowledged that being able to do so may be a long time in coming.

It has proved one wait too long, however she will still benefit from laws she passed which give employee benefits to same sex spouses married in states that recognize them.

Parker had previously said that she wanted to be married in Texas, but acknowledged that change may be some time in coming

This move has angered some of her detractors, including Harris County GOP chair Jared Woodfill, who told ABD Eyewitness News: 'This is about a bigger political agenda for her.

'The fact she is going to another state and then will come back and live and enjoy the benefits of her unilateral, executive, unlawful order represents, that really the worst in a politician.'
