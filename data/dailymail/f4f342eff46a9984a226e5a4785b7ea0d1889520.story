Moving on: Ann Curry announced today her departure from NBC. The 58-year-old served as a co-anchor on the Today show for just a year before she was replaced in June 2012 with the younger Savannah Guthrie

Ann Curry's toxic career at NBC is finally over. 

The former Today co-anchor is leaving the network more than two years after her tearful last day on the morning show to start her own production company. 

'This is about reaching for the edge of the future in journalism, which we know is undergoing an irrevocable transition,' Curry said in the statement. 

'In today’s world of fragmented media, this is the time to seize the opportunity to improve the way we distribute and even tell stories. 

'I want to expand my drive to give voice to the voiceless to emerging platforms and produce both scripted and non-scripted content, in addition to continuing to report on-air about stories that matter.' 

NBC says they are helping finance Curry's new company, which will produce documentaries and special reports for news outlets.

'We’re proud to support Ann in her new venture, and we look forward to more of her exceptional storytelling,' NBCUniversal News Group Chairman Pat Fili-Krushel. said. 'She is committed to uncovering critical issues, humanizing them, and ultimately helping viewers understand and connect.'

Curry, 58, has allegedly been in protracted negotiations with the network to end her contract, which is reportedly worth a lofty $12million.

Though her stint as Today show anchor lasted just one year, she had been a reporter on the show for 15 years prior and was well liked by long-time viewers who reacted negatively to her abrupt dismissal in June 2012. 

Long time coming: The news comes two and half years after Curry's last day on Today in June 2012, when she was pushed to tears having to announce she was being kicked off the show 

Uncomfortable: Curry's terse reaction when Lauer tried to comfort her with a kiss on the head fueled reports that he had a hand in her departure

Her last day, where she tearfully announced her premature Today show retirement, marked the beginning of a dip in ratings for the ensuing months - worsening the cutthroat rivalry with  Good Morning America.

Curry's strained face as Lauer leaned over for a comforting kiss on the cheek on her last day did not go unnoticed, and fueled reports that he sabotaged her career by demanding she be moved during his own contract negotiations.

Savannah Guthrie, 43, replaced Curry in the position. 

In an apparent attempt to save Lauer's withering reputation, and Today's ratings, then-executive producer Jim Bell eventually took the blame for Curry's departure.

Curry has spent most of her career at NBC, joining the network as a correspondent for NBC News Chicago in 1990.

She rose quickly at the network and was promoted to a position in New York, serving as a substitute news anchor for Lauer from 1994-1997.

When Lauer left that position, Curry took over and became one of the longest-serving Today news anchors in history, behind Frank Blair.

In May 2005, Curry transitioned to co-anchoring Dateline NBC with Stone Phillips, and later became the primary anchor when Phillips left in June 2007.

She continued anchoring Dateline NBC and filling in occasionally on NBC Nightly News until she was made anchor at Today in 2011.

Curry is responsible for getting some of the most high-profile interviews the Today show has seen during her period as news anchor and anchor.

Perhaps her most memorable was an interview with then Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, just a few days before he traveled to the U.S. to speak at the United Nations in 2009.

Hypothetically, her most recent position as Today show 'anchor-at-large' and NBC Nightly News contributor would have presented her the opportunity to land more exclusive interviews like this, but she has been rarely seen on the network these past two years.

'Ann has been unhappy for a long time because she’s basically doing nothing, while NBC is unhappy that she has been paid a lot of money to do nothing,' a source at NBC told the New York Post.

Curry is married to software executive Brian Ross and the couple have two children.
