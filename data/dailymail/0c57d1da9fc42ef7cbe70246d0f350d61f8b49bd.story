A new report has revealed that not a single UK city or town has what's classed as superfast download speeds, set at 24Mbps or above.

The figures from uSwitch claim the fastest speeds are in Telford, at 22.9Mbps, and this is despite the major networks 
offering contracts that promise speeds in excess of 50Mbps, 
including Virgin, BT and Sky.

The latest State of the Internet Report by researchers Akamai found the average user in the UK realistically gets just 8.4Mbps and this average puts Great Britain in ninth place globally in terms of speeds.

The latest Akamai State of the Internet Report compared web speeds in 129 countries. South Korea came top with an average speed of 13.3Mbps. The UK tied with Sweden to sit at the bottom of the top 10 because the average user gets speeds of just 8.4Mbps

This chart shows how the UK compares to other countries in terms of average speeds. In positive news, speeds in the country did rise by 48 per cent in the past year

In the report, the UK is shown in tenth on the list because it tied with Sweden for speed but comes after Sweden alphabetically.

Ahead of the UK is South Korea, on 13.3Mbps, Japan, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Latvia, Netherlands, Czech Republic and the United States.

However, the UK did see the highest speed increases year-on-year, with averages jumping by almost 50 per cent.

The figures from uSwitch also found more than a quarter of UK postcodes still struggle to get 3Mbps and at these speeds it would take around six hours to download a high-quality film.

Focusing on the UK's biggest towns 
and cities, uSwitch found Telford tops the list with average download 
speeds of 22.99Mbps, while people in Hull get around half this speed, at
 10.49Mbps.

London came in 
at 26 with average download speeds of 17Mbps, with almost a fifth of 
broadband users getting speeds lower than 3Mpbs.

This chart shows how web speeds compare across the UK's largest postcodes. The research by uSwitch found not a single town or city in Great Britain has speeds classed as superfast, which is 24Mbps or higher. London came in at 26th place

In urban areas, Hull has made the 
least progress with speeds increasing just 26 per cent, compared to 
speeds in Leeds that have rocketed by 87 per cent.

Norwich is also making progress, with speeds up 75 per cent since last year, yet it’s still one of the slowest UK cities for broadband with over a third  not seeing their average speeds break the 3Mpbs mark.

Back globally, South Korea who came out on top with average speeds of 13.3Mbps dropped 6.4 per cent from the previous year.

New figures from uSwitch found that not a
 single UK town city has what's classed as superfast download speeds, 
which is 24Mbps or above.

This
 is despite the major networks offering contracts that promise speeds of
 between 50Mbps and 100Mbps, including Virgin, BT and Sky.

Additionally, the government has set a target to offer superfast broadband to 95 per cent of Britain by 2017. 

Government agency Broadband Delivery UK has a budget of £530 million to invest in public broadband.

In the U.S, the District of Columbia had the fastest average speeds at 11.4Mbps - up 17 per cent from the previous year.

Connecticut was in tenth place with 10Mpbs.

Speeds were much more consistent across American districts and in some instances varied by just 0.1Mbps, on average.

Utah lost 0.4 per cent, compared to the previous quarter, to 10.3 Mbps, Delaware lost 3 per cent to 10.8 Mbps, and New Hampshire lost 7.9 per cent, down to 10.7 Mbps.

Additionally, Vermont saw a 27 per cent quarter-over-quarter loss that dropped it not only out of first place, but also out of the top 10 entirely.

The slowest state was Arkansas with 4.5Mbps, despite a 5.6 per cent quarterly increase.

Akamai is a cloud company that specialises in internet use and compiles its State of the Internet Report at various points throughout the year.

It looks at speeds, as well how many people use the internet, security and mobile use in 129 countries.

Average connection speeds across the world based on surveyed 
mobile network providers ranged from a high of 9.7 Mbps down to a low of
 just 0.5 Mbps. Yet traffic doubled over the past year. 

Marie-Louise Abretti, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com, said: 'Urban speeds in the UK are around three times faster than rural speeds, but even download speeds in Britain’s 50 biggest cities still aren’t superfast.

'The Government’s blinkered focus on bringing superfast connections to 95 per cent of Britain by 2017 is all very well but, if they pull it off, it’s only half the battle won.

'If people don’t actually use super-fast broadband because it’s too expensive, or they don’t know they can get it, then what’s the point? Uptake will be heavily dependent on both price and awareness.'

The UK and Sweden were tied at the bottom of the top 10 list on 8.4Mbps

@highlight

No UK postcodes reached speeds over 24Mbps, the threshold for superfast

Telford was top with average download speeds of 22.9Mbps

This is despite many broadband contracts promising 50Mbps or higher
