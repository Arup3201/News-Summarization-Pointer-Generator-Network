David Cameron is facing humiliation in Europe, as Brussels prepares to hand Britain a junior commissioner role.

A leaked document reveals Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker plans to give Tory peer Lord Hill the Energy and Climate Change brief.

Downing Street scrabbled to insist this would still be considered an economic brief, but is far from the heavyweight role Mr Cameron hoped for and would see Lord Hill serving under ex-Latvian PM Valdis Dombrovskis.

David Cameron tried to block Jean-Claud Juncker's appointment as Commission President, and now faces the paying the price by Britain being given a low rank job

Mr Cameron caused a major political row this summer when he tried to block Mr Juncker’s appointment.

The Prime Minister pushed the decision to a vote of all EU leaders, and lost after only attracting the support of Hungary.

Mr Juncker then warned Mr Cameron to send a woman to Europe or risk Britain forfeiting a top role at the European Commission. But the PM instead chose Lord Hill, a former Tory education minister who was sitting in the Cabinet as Leader of the Lords.

His role in Brussels could be key to Mr Cameron’s hopes of securing major reform of the EU, before Britain holds an in-out referendum in 2017. 

It now appeared that Britain could be punished for the decision, after it emerged the big economic roles look set to go to other countries.

Each EU member state nominates a candidate to become a European Commissioner, but as President Mr Juncker decides which areas they will have responsibilities for.

The last British commissioner, Baroness Ashton, held the prestigious foreign affairs brief.

But according to a report on the Euroactiv website, Britain will be left with the Energy and Climate Change brief this time round.

In contrast France is in line for the powerful Competition commissioner, a key area for Mr Cameron’s hopes of overhauling Brussels’ powers.

Lord Hill had insisted three weeks ago that he did not want the EU Commissioner job, but weeks later Mr Cameron put his name forward

The list has not been finalised, and could yet be open to negotiation.

In an attempt to put a brave face on the issue, Mr Cameron's official spokesman today insisted that some commentators had considered the energy role to be an economic brief.

'When the prime minister met the president of the commission Jean Claude Juncker he made the case for an economic portfolio for the incoming UK commissioner and that hasn’t changed,' the spokesman added.  

Lord Hill was a surprise choice for the role, after more high profile figures including ex-ministers Andrew Lansley and David Willetts were tipped for the job. 

Other countries appear to have responded to the plea for more women in key roles. Belgium has chosen Marianne Thyssen as its candidate. 

Belgium was the last of the EU's 28 EU members to put forward its choice for commissioner, a result of continuing uncertainty on a new coalition government.

The European Parliament has warned that it might not confirm Juncker's 28-strong team if it contained fewer women than the outgoing Commission, which has nine.  

Lord Hill's nomination attracted ridicule coming days after he ruled himself out for the role. 

Asked if he wanted to go to Brussels, he told the Conservative Home website: 'Non, non, non.

‘First, I don't believe I'm going to be asked. Secondly, I like it here. I quite like it at home, in the British Isles.'

In a separate interview with PoliticsHome, Lord Hill also confessed: ‘I am not very good at thinking long term.’

Yet his role in Brussels could be key to Mr Cameron’s hopes of securing major reform of the EU, before Britain holds an in-out referendum in 2017. 

It was not the first time the PM appears to have ignored the peer. 

In 2012, he secured a meeting with the PM to tender his resignation. But instead of accepting – or protesting – Lord Hill’s decision, Mr Cameron reportedly told him to carry on his good work, and strode out of the room after being told he was late for a photocall. As a result, Lord Hill remained in post. 

Lord Hill worked in the Conservative Research Unit and as special adviser to Kenneth Clarke in the 1980s and served in the Number 10 Policy Unit 1991-2 and as political secretary to Prime Minister John Major.
