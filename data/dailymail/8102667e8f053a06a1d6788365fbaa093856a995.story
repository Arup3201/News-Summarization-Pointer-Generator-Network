The U.S. Embassy in Norway's capital was evacuated today after a suspected bomb was spotted on one of its official vehicles, just a year after the Breivik massacre.

But the discovery – which sparked a full-scale security alert - was actually a training device mistakenly left attached to the car after a U.S. security exercise in Oslo.

It triggered a security alert which led to the special forces being deployed and a 550 yard cordon around the embassy, which was evacuated along with other buildings.

The evacuation covered buildings within a 500-metre radius of the U.S Embassy, pictured, and included the Royal Palace, though no one from the royal family was there

Police also shut underground rail lines and brought in heavily armed special forces after the fake bomb was spotted during a routine check.

It comes just one year after police were criticised for reacting too slowly when gunman Anders Behring Breivik bombed Government buildings in Oslo, before going on a killing rampage.

Last month a ten-week trial into the killings concluded, during which Breivik admitted killing 77 people and injuring 242 on July 22 last year, but denied charges of terrorism and premeditated murder.

The court heard from the 33-year-old who said he 'acted to stop a Muslim invasion' to 'defend the indigenous Norwegian people'.

Th prosecution has asked that he be deemed insane. A decision is expected next month.

The 32-year-old Norwegian confessed to setting off the car bomb that killed eight people in downtown Oslo, before gunning down scores of youth from the left-leaning Labour Party 
at their annual retreat on an island north-west of the capital.

A
police statement today said: ‘Our bomb squad removed the object and 
found that it was a practice bomb which was previously used for an 
internal exercise at the embassy,’

The U.S. Embassy declined to comment, but will no doubt face tough questions about how the mistake was able to happen, particularly at a time when memories of last year's shocking attack are still fresh in the memories of Norway's residents.

The embassy is planning to relocate due to security reasons to the outskirts of Oslo from its current location adjacent to the royal palace and near the foreign ministry.
