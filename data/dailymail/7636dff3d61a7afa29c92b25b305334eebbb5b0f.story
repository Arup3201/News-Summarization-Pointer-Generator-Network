The lucky UK ticket-holder who scooped a huge £37 million on last night's EuroMillions draw has come forward, Camelot said.

The prize won last night is the 14th-largest jackpot win ever in the UK and the eighth big British EuroMillions triumph this year.

It is not known yet if they want to keep their identity a secret.

The mammoth £37m EuroMillions win will be paid out on Monday should the ticket prove to be correct

A National Lottery spokesman said: 'This is amazing. Just a month after Adrian and Gillian Bayford scooped £148 million, we have another UK ticket-holder banking the EuroMillions jackpot.

'It has been an extraordinary year for UK ticket-holders - this is the eighth EuroMillions jackpot to be won on these shores in 2012.

'This new jackpot winning ticket-holder now sits 14th on the exclusive National Lottery Rich List.

'Over 2,900 people have become millionaires since The National Lottery began and, to date, our players have raised an amazing £28 billion and counting for National Lottery Good Causes.'

Should the ticket be correct, the prize could be paid out when the banks open on Monday, Camelot said.

The ticket-holder will then decide whether or not to go public and share their news.

Life-changing: Adrian and Gillian Bayford were the last winners of a giant EuroMillions prize, scooping £148m

Rolling in it: Colin and Chris Weir, from Largs in Ayrshire, who won £161m on the EuoMillions last July

Adrian Bayford, and wife Gillian, of Haverhill in Suffolk, won the second-largest jackpot yet in the UK after taking home £148 million last month.

In February, Cassey Carrington and Matt Topham, both 22, of Stapleford in Nottinghamshire, scooped £45.1m.

Husband and wife Gareth and Catherine Bull from Mansfield won £40 million a month earlier.

A consortium of bus drivers from Corby, Northamptonshire, pocketed £38 million in March, while anonymous winners picked up £22.1 million that month and £46.4 million in February.

A ticket worth £63.8 million bought in Hertfordshire last June has not been claimed.

Last night's winning main EuroMillions numbers were 13, 15, 30, 35, and 42, and the Lucky Stars were 4 and 6.

The winning ticket is worth £37,827,314.
