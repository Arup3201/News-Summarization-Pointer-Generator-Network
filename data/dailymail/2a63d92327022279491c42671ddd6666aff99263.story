Michael Laudrup is likely to complete his return to management this week, with the Dane agreeing a deal to fill the vacancy at Qatari champions Lekhwiya.

Laudrup was sacked by Swansea in February, but Sportsmail understands he concluded talks with Lekhwiya officials in London over the weekend and will take over from former Marseille manager Eric Gerets, who left last month.

Turkish side Galatasaray are also interested in Laudrup who has been out of work since he left the Liberty Stadium towards the end of last season.

Bumpy ride: Laudrup also took Swansea into the Europa League

He guided Swansea to the Capital One Cup in 2012-13 – his first season in charge – and was rewarded with a two-year deal in February 2013 on improved terms.

But, with the club’s form and results dipping as they juggled domestic and European football, Laudrup was sacked following a run of six defeats in eight Premier League fixtures.

He recently agreed a settlement with Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins on the remaining 18 months of his contract.  

Sources close to Laudrup claim he has had ‘many offers’ since he was replaced at Swansea by Garry Monk.

Lekhwiya were only founded five years ago, but have won the Qatar Stars League three of the past four seasons.

Their chairman, Sheik Abdullah bin Nasser bin Abdullah Al Ahmed Al Thani, is from the Qatari ruling family.
