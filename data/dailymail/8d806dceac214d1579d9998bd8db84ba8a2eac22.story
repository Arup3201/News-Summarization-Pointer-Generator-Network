Pierpaolo Bisoli became the third managerial casualty of the Serie A season on Monday when Cesena announced he had been sacked as coach.

The club said in a statement that president Giorgio Lugaresi had thanked Bisoli and his staff for their work.

'The way they avoided relegation and, the following year, gained promotion to the top flight, will never be forgotten,' it added.
