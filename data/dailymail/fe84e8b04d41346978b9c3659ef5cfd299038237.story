The door to Aladdin’s Cave may just have opened a crack for Tyson Fury.

To find out for sure he must batter Dereck Chisora off his hinges this July, having already pronounced himself willing to fight for a world heavyweight championship soon after that.

Opportunity knocked when Bermane Stiverne flattened Chris Arreola in Los Angeles on Saturday night to win the WBC title.

New champion: Bermane Stiverne celebrates after beating Chris Arreola to win the WBC heavyweight title

Since Stiverne is promoted by none other than Don King all manner of possibilities presented themselves at the knock-out moment, including that of a voluntary defence against Fury.

The assumption that Saturday night’s winner would automatically meet his mandatory challenger, KO phenomenon Deontay Wilder, in his next fight were brushed aside by King.

He of the electrified hair and electrifying rhetoric sees money to be made for Stiverne as well as rejuvenation of his own image while he is back in control of the most cherished of all the heavyweight belts.

‘The official challenger does not automatically get the next fight,’ pronounced King. ‘Under the rules we are entitled to a voluntary match after winning the title.’

Cue T. Fury.

The giant traveller his new boxing gym at The Platinum Community Centre in Bolton on Tuesday, in partnership with his uncle and trainer Peter Fury and his younger but only slightly smaller fighting cousin Hughie.

Fury, he who would become the first member of the travelling community to wear a heavyweight crown, is hoping that a second victory over Chisora, in this ill-tempered re-match, will deliver his shot against the holder of all the other alpha-belts, Wladimir Klitschko.

However, the younger of the Ukrainian brothers declares himself ‘super interested’ in restoring to the family Klitschko the WBC title his sibling Vitali vacated when he committed himself full-time to the political struggle in their homeland.

That would make Wladimir the first in heavyweight history to wear all the WBA, WBC, IBF, WBO, IBO and Ring Magazine belts. To strengthen his argument he has also expressed ‘a powerful desire’ to box in America for the first time in six years.

Wladimir has also been instructed by the IBF, who have been waiting their turn, to honour their mandatory challenger, Bulgaria’s Kubrat Palev.

To complicate the picture further, not only Wladimir but also Vitali have written to the WBC requesting a fight with Stiverne. Since Vitali is that organisation’s champion emeritus they are duty bound to consider his claim, which suggests he may be cutting back his involvement in troubled Kiev after withdrawing his candidacy for the presidency of Ukraine in forthcoming elections.

King, though, is unlikely to be rushed in any of those directions. 

The architect of Muhammad Ali’s Rumble in the Jungle with George Foreman and Thrilla’ in Manilla against Joe Frazier – among many historic fights – is relishing his return to the spotlight.

He will also want to maximise earnings.

Fury could bring the prospect of a big-money fight in England, or offer himself up as a box-office opponent for Stiverne in Canada, where Haitii’s first-ever heavyweight champion is now based, or the US.

The American people were hoping that Arreola would bring the world heavyweight title home from Eastern Europe for the first time in almost a decade. Instead, they are basking in a little reflected glory as Stiverne restores at least one of the belts to their continent.

Wilder, who has blown away all his 31 professional opponents inside four rounds, is their best bet for reclaiming what they long-regarded as the symbol of American machismo.

But King may well see the flamboyant, outspoken Fury as not only a marketable opponent but also a softer option than either the Bronze Bomber or the Klitschko brothers.

Even so, whoever takes on Stiverne next has been warned by Arreola, who was knocked down twice on his way to sixth round defeat and then said of this 35-year-old late developer: ‘He hits like a bulldozer.’

Deontay Wilder, meanwhile, has been keeping his hand in by beating up an internet troll who called him the N-word on twitter and threatened to tape up his daughter’s mouth.

The Bronze Bomber, so-called after his Olympic medal of that colour, protected himself against prosecution for using his fists against a member of the public  by obliging a rather unpleasant individual by the name of Charlie Zelenoff to sign a waiver and a contract  if he wanted to fight him.

That done, the irregular sparring session then took place in the Hollywood Gym in Los Angeles late at night on the eve of the Stiverne-Arreola world heavyweight  title fight.

Zelenoff, who once provoked Floyd Mayweather’s trainer-father into a similar event, was duly knocked down three times – even though the 6ft 7in Wilder said: ‘I held back despite my original plan being to hurt this dude real bad. He threatened to murder me and called me the N-word.

‘But what really got to me was when he said he was going to duck-tape my daughter’s mouth. Talk like that about my kids and that’s when you see the other side of the humble, funny Deontay Wilder. The part that will come and get you.’

That message comes with a health warning to Messrs Klitschko, Stiverne, Fury and anyone else fancying their chances:  Don’t sledge Mr Wilder.

Closing in: Wilder is the mandatory challenger to Stiverne and wants his shot at the WBC world champion

Mikkel Kessler’s unexpected comeback raises a multitude of enticing possibilities, starting with Froch-Kessler III if Carl the Nottingham Cobra wins his re-match with George Groves, or a fight with Saint George if not.

Kessler stands at one win apiece with Froch, who outpointed the Viking Warrior a thriller at London’s O2 arena a year ago. At 35, he is a five-time super-middleweight champion and his only other defeats came against Joe Calzaghe and Andre Ward.

Kessler, as he became a father, seemed about to call time on his 16-year career but says now: ‘I don’t want to go out a loser, after that second fight with Carl. So Froch again? Why not?’

He is also eyeing a rematch with Ward and a world-title challenge to Gennady Golovkin and adds: ‘Froch, Groves, Ward, Golovkin... whoever it is I’ll be ready in October.’

Not done yet: Mikkel Kessler (left) has announced his intention to carry on boxing

Last time out: Kessler has not fought since losing his rematch to Carl Froch last May

So, we have Bernard Hopkins a world champion at 49, Wladimir Klitschko at 38 vowing to reign as heavyweight champion for another ten years, Floyd Mayweather, Froch and Kessler still going strong in their mid-30s…..to name but a few.

Whoever was it who said they never come back?

RIP Jimmy Ellis. 

The former world heavyweight champion who died last week, aged 74, was laid to rest this very Monday in Louisville, the home-town of himself and his peer Muhammad Ali, who said: ‘In the world of heavyweights Jimmy was one of the best. He had exceptional hand speed and a strong chin but his greatest qualities were his gentle manner and the compassion in his heart. I had a kinship with Jimmy. We were of the same cloth.’

Ali stopped Ellis in the 12th of 15 rounds in their only fight but says of him: ‘Great competitors who happen to be great friends are rare. Jimmy was that to me and I will miss him.’

Remembered: Ellis, who gave Ali  a tough fight, passed away aged 74 after a battle with dementia

As The Greatest misses so many of the great men with whom he shared a ring but who, incredibly while he is engaged in his long battle with Parkinson’s, he has survived. 

Men like Joe Frazier, Henry Cooper, Sonny Liston, Ken Norton, Floyd Patterson, Archie Moore, Cleveland Williams, Ron Lyle, Trevor Berbick.

All gone... while the Miracle of Muhammad lives on.

One of the best: Ali praised Ellis, saying he had excellent hand speed as well as a strong chin

Take that: Joe Frazier connects to the body of Jimmy Ellis who misses with a right during their fight in 1970
