The French and Italian contingent may beg to differ, for Rihanna, no one beats the British when it comes to getting dressed.

'Britain has the most fashionable kids in the world,' the singer said. 'These kids inspired the high-end designers, they say what's cool.'

Speaking ahead of her London Fashion Week debut on Saturday, Rihanna also revealed that her inspiration for the collection was her own wardrobe.

'I designed every single piece in the collection so I could wear it,' the singer-turned-designer told Grazia.

'I think my fans trust my style so they'll have fun with it.'

Although the range was unveiled on Saturday during London Fashion Week, the pieces won't be available to buy until early next month.

But while the clothes might not be available yet, the campaign to sell them has well and truly begun.

The first campaign shots, created by renowned photographer Mario Sorrenti back in December, have already landed and certainly don't disappoint.

Along with Cara Delevingne's best friend, model Jourdan Dunn, the edgy photoshoot also stars pink-haired model of the moment, Charlotte Free.

Styled by the singer herself, the pictures show off Rihanna's Nineties-inspired pieces, including a striped crop top, a fluoro yellow dress and a strappy black slip with a daring thigh high split.

'I've wanted to design my own fashion line for a very long time now,' said Rihanna of her River Island collaboration.

'It  has been something I've thought about ever since I started loving fashion.

'Every time I saw a garment on the rack, there was something I wanted to change, so I felt the only way I could do that was by designing the perfect thing for me.'

With her S/S13 collection for the high street brand picking up plaudits from critics and the public alike, it won't come as a surprise to learn that the singer has plans for more.

Speaking to the Telegraph newspaper, Rihanna revealed that not only is a new collection in the planning stages, it will also offer 'a whole different flip' on her current designs.

Rihanna for River Island is available online at www.riverisland.com/rihanna-for-river-island and in store from 5 March.
