Sat-navs may help motorists negotiate the trickiest of ring roads and even avoid speeding fines, but the urgent instruction of ‘turn around when possible’ is enough to panic the calmest of drivers.

Now, experts claim the instruction could mean more than a navigational nightmare – it could also put a driver and other road users at risk of a serious crash.

A survey has revealed that one in seven drivers who use a sat-nav admit making impromptu illegal or risky manoeuvres to correct mistakes when following sat-nav instructions.

The statistics, gathered by road safety charity Brake and insurance firm Direct Line, suggest that urgent u-turns are not the only danger.

The study says that one in 14 drivers have had a near miss and have swerved or braked suddenly to avoid a hazard because they were distracted by a sat-nav.

This number rose to 11 per cent of drivers aged under 24, but dropped to below five per cent for motorists older than 35 year’s old.

If used correctly, sat-navs are a safer option than a driver looking away from the road to a paper map, but there is fresh evidence to suggest that relying on the gadget can make individuals drive faster, paying less attention to hazards on the road.

A total of seven per cent of the 1,000 individuals surveyed admitted to being distracted by the stereo, while 12 per cent said they took their full attention away from the road because of passengers.

The study says that one in 14 drivers have had a near miss and have swerved or braked suddenly to avoid a hazard because they were distracted by a sat-nav.  Previous studies have found that people are more than four times likely to have a crash (stock image) if they are multitasking while driving

A total of three per cent of people said they were distracted by their smartphone, while two per cent were preoccupied by food and drink.

Brake has called on drivers to programme their sat-nav before they set off on a journey and not to fiddle with any gadget while driving.

Julie Townsend, deputy chief executive, Brake, said: ‘The sat-nav is there to help you keep focused on driving rather than worry about directions, but it's not there to make all the decisions for you.

‘Driving is an unpredictable activity, so you still need to look at signs, particularly those warning of hazards or speed limits, and watch for people and unexpected problems.

‘For many drivers there is an increasing array of technological temptations that can pose a deadly distraction; it’s essential to resist to ensure you and others arrive safely.’

Research by Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety in Massachusetts has shown that the vast majority of people are unable to multitask at the wheel without their driving being affected.

A study of in-vehicle video footage  estimated that 22 per cent of crashes could be caused, at least in part, by driver distraction.

It also showed that drivers who perform a secondary task at the wheel are two to three times more likely to crash.

Other studies have found that more complex secondary tasks, like talking on a mobile phone or texting, increase crash risk even more.

Researchers at the University of Western Australia have shown that talking on a phone (hands-free or hand-held) makes drivers four times more likely to have a serious crash, and texting raises the odds further.

A study by Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety in Massachusetts found that while drivers may think they can multitask, 98 per cent are not able to divide their attention without a significant deterioration in driving performance.

Scientists at Royal Holloway University of London found that using a sat-nav can increase driver speed and reduce observation, but research has also found that using a voice-based sat-nav is safer than using a visual display or paper map.

Listening to loud music has been found to slow drivers’ reaction times, and encourages aggressive driving, according to researchers at the Memorial University of Newfoundland.

Monash University Accident Research Centre in Melbourne, Australia, found that fiddling with a stereo while driving leads to slower reaction times and more errors such as accidentally lane drifting.

Devices such as cruise control, aimed at reducing the driver’s workload, can also have the unintended side-effect of making drivers less attentive and more susceptible to fatigue, a study by the University of Toronto concludes.

Furthermore, drivers who text and talk on a phone while driving are two to three times more likely to crash than those who are concentrating on the road.

The charity has called on the British government to regulate the use of built in entertainment and information systems in cars, which show social media updates and traffic warnings on the dashboard, for example.

‘If these devices are used for tasks such as emailing and social media updates while driving, they are potentially as distracting and dangerous as using a mobile phone,’ it said, suggesting tougher penalties for distracted drivers, including much higher fines for those caught using phones.

Brake also wants to ban hands-free kits due to recent research highlighting they do not make driving with a phone much safer.
