Jihadi's John's younger brother was convicted of handling stolen goods in a case just months after the older brother was acquitted of the same charge.

Mohammed Emwazi's involvement with criminal gangs has emerged as a key staging post on his path to extremism and eventually to becoming the notorious executioner for the Islamic State.

It has now emerged that his younger brother Omar, five years his junior, pleaded guilty to possession of stolen goods at Isleworth Crown Court in West London in August 2012. 

Guilty: Omar Emwazi - younger brother of Mohammed Emwazi, revealed last week as Jihadi John - pleaded guilty to handling stolen goods in 2012

The 21-year-old received a community order for 12 months, 100 hours unpaid work and had to pay prosecution costs of £800. 

Emwazi's younger brother has previously posted his support online for radical preachers including Sheikh Khalid Yasin and Imran ibn Mansur, known as Dawah Man. 

Omar is also a member of a street preaching group called Power of Dawah, which supports the fundamentalist preacher Abdur Raheem Green, who preached to Umar Farouq Abdulmutallab, the 'Underpants Bomber'.

A friend said Omar got into fights at school, and added: 'I don't think he was one of the brightest academically either, to put it politely.

'I know some of the most harmless people that are on dawah stalls. However, given his situation, I can see why that may ring some alarms.'

Abdulmutallab pleaded guilty in 2012 to attempting to blow up a commercial plane on a would-be suicide mission for al-Qaeda.

He was caught trying to board a plane on Christmas Day in 2009 with explosives stitched into his underwear, earning him the nickname the 'Underpants Bomber'.

But the Nigerian was left badly burned when the bomb failed to detonate fully on a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit.

He had previously invited controversial Abdur Raheem Green to speak while he was president of Islamic Society at University College London in 2005.

Muslim convert Green has previously has been accused of supporting jihadism, and once proclaimed: 'Dying while fighting jihad is one of the surest ways to paradise and Allah's good pleasure'

It was also revealed this week that Omar was a member of a group dubbed the 'Muslim mafia' in school and admired a controversial Islamic hate preacher.

The 21-year-old is said to have supported Sheikh Khalid Yasin, who was lauded by Lee Rigby killer Michael Adebowale.

Omar is said to have quickly taken down his Facebook page after his brother's new identity was revealed last week.

He reportedly used the site to 'like' Sheikh Yasin, a preacher who has called the Taliban his 'brothers' and denounced both Christian and Jewish beliefs as 'filth'.

Yasin has also claimed that the Koran gives men permission to 'beat women lightly' and has called homosexuality an 'aberration' that should be 'punishable by death'.

Michael Adebowale - who was jailed last year for the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby - said Yasin's views taught him the 'purpose of life' and convinced him to convert to Islam. 

Mohammed Emwazi  - revealed last week as the evil executioner behind the Jihadi John mask - was a 'person of interest' to MI5 as a member of a cell known as The London Boys, which was set up to recruit and raise funds for Somalia-based terror group al Shabab.

Security services were aware of Emwazi for six years before he appeared on a hostage video for the first time in August 2014.

It is believed The London Boys had links to the gang behind the failed July 21, 2005 attacks on London.

Court documents revealed a leading member of Emwazi's network had a phone conversation on the day of the attacks with Hussein Osman, who was later jailed for life for placing an explosive at Shepherd's Bush tube station. 

Yesterday, it was revealed that Emwazi's mother screamed out in shock when she realised he was Jihadi John after watching a beheading video.

Ghaneya Emwazi, 47, confirmed her son was the IS chief executioner when she and her husband Jasem, 51, were questioned by the Kuwaiti security services on Sunday. 

Other appalled relatives of Emwazi condemned his actions and said they would welcome his death.

A Kuwaiti cousin, who would not give his name, said: ‘We hate him. We hope he will be killed soon. This will be good news for our family.’ 

It was also revealed last week that Emwazi stood trial twice, accused of having stolen bikes hidden in the family shed and twice he was acquitted.

The first case only came to court after the owner of one of the stolen bikes tracked down Emwazi who had put it up for sale on Ebay.

The victim contacted him posing as a prospective buyer to get his details which he then passed on to the police.

Emwazi faced five charges of possession of criminal property on or before September 29 2010, 'knowing or suspecting it to represent the proceeds of criminal property.'

The items were listed as a BE1 bicycle, a Trek Elpha, a Cannondale Bad Boy Bicycle, a Brompton Bicycle, and a Cervelo Bicycle.

Emwazi, who was 22 at the time, gave his address as the family home on the Mozart estate in Queen's Park, West London and his date of birth as August 17 1988.

He claimed he had bought the bikes from the GumTree website and was selling them on at a profit.

The judge directed the jury to find Emwazi not guilty after a two day trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court in June 2011.

Emwazi faced a second trial at Southwark Crown Court a few months later in December 2011 for a similar case where he was also acquitted.
