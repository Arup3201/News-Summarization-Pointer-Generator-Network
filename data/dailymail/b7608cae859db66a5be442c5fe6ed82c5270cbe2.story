Too young: Yuri Hirayama, 16, was killed in a fiery car crash along with his parents while traveling toward the Grand Canyon for a spring break vacation

A 16-year-old boy and his parents have been killed in a fiery car wreck involving a police pursuit in Arizona, which also left a little girl clinging to life.

Stevenson High School sophomore Yuri Hirayama, his 9-year-old sister, Rinka, and their parents, Tomohiro and Sachiyo Hirayama, were driving from their home in Vernon Hills, Illinois, toward the Grand Canyon Friday evening when their spring break vacation came to an abrupt and tragic end.

Police said just after 9pm, the family's 2014 black Chrysler van was struck by a maroon Ford pickup truck, which was being chased by the Navajo police Department along U.S. Route 160 west of Tuba City, Arizona.

The vehicle carrying two people crossed the median on a two-lane road and struck the Hirayama's' van head-on.

Arizona Department of Public Safety spokesman Raul Garcia said police went in pursuit of the pickup after it was spotted driving erratically in Tuba City 25 miles away, according to Chicago Tribune.

At the time of the crash, the officers' vehicle was more than a mile behind due to traffic congestion.

The collision caused the Ford pickup to burst into flames, killing its two occupants, who were not immediately named.

The crash also killed three members of the Hirayama family on the spot. Nine-year-old Rinka survived the impact and was taken to a Phoenix hospital in critical condition.

The child's grandparents are expected to fly in from Japan this week to be with her since the Hirayamas had no other relatives in the U.S, reported the Daily Herald.

The family, who were originally from Japan, arrived in the U.S. from Holland last summer when Mr Hirayama, 50, accepted a job in the Vernon Hills area.

New in town: Yuri enrolled in Stevenson High School in Lincolnshire, Illinois, at the beginning of the current school year a few months after his family arrived from Holland

Yuri Hirayama, 16, enrolled in Stevenson High School in Lincolnshire at the beginning of the current school year, becoming a member of the fencing program and a club for transfer students.

The teenager was not fluent in English and was taking classes in the English Language Learning Program, according to school officials. 

‘The recollections of Yuki were that he was a happy boy with a great disposition. Everyone was just getting to know him a little bit,’ school spokesman Jim Conrey told NBC Chicago.

Yuri’s sister, Rinka, is a third-grader at Half Day School in Lincolnshire.
