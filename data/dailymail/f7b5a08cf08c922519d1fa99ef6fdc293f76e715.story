The National Basketball Association is one of the pre-eminent sport leagues in the world and every Thursday, Bleacher Report will bring you a round-up of all the action on and off court Stateside. 

Newsmaker 

The incensed version of Derrick Rose took centre stage following the Chicago Bulls' 108-94 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday night. In speaking with reporters after the game, he expressed his frustration in no uncertain terms. 

Rose said: 'We've got to give a better effort. It seems like we're not even competing and it's f***ing irritating. We're midway through the season; no excuses; when you don't have that edge you are going to get your (butt) whipped.' 

Questioning effort is a great way to set a locker room ablaze. Whether the ignited fire has its intended impact is a different story.

Good Week 

The Atlanta Hawks matched the all-time franchise record of a 14-game winning streak with victory over the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday. The 35-8 Hawks have surprisingly emerged as the hottest team in the NBA, using the recent stretch of phenomenal basketball to build a healthy lead over the Washington Wizards for the top seed in the Eastern Conference. 

With centre Al Horford leading the way, Atlanta matched a franchise record set back in 1993-94, when the team went 57-25 before losing to none other than the Pacers in the second round of the play-offs.

Bad Week

The Milwaukee Bucks have been among the NBA's most pleasant surprises this season, but maintaining their high level of play may prove difficult as the league has suspended center Larry Sanders. 

The 26-year-old big man will miss at least 10 games after violating the NBA's drug policy: this marks the second time in as many seasons that the league has disciplined Sanders, his 2013-14 suspension coming due to marijuana use. To be clear, the league has not announced what Sanders tested positive for in this instance. 

Sanders' suspension will continue 'until he is in full compliance with his treatment program' Sanders' production has dropped off a bit over the past two seasons after an excellent 2012-13 campaign, but he is still an important player for the Bucks.

Brit Watch

Miami Heat veteran forward Luol Deng is currently dealing with an illness that kept him out of Wednesday's game. Although not quite the player he once was with the Chicago Bulls, Deng has continued to serve as a solid two-way player in his first season with the Heat. 

Injuries, however, are beginning to take their toll on the 29-year-old. He missed 19 games with a variety of afflictions last season and was hampered earlier this year by a hand injury.

And Finally

Being 34-years-old doesn't make one a senior citizen, but for Jason Richardson of the Philadelphia 76ers, it makes him quite a bit older than his team-mates. That's why the young Sixers had some fun with their veteran teammate on his birthday. 

To celebrate Richardson's birthday, 76ers players gave him adult diapers, a robe and baby food. Richardson (born in 1981), Andrei Kirilenko (1981), Luc Mbah a Moute (1986) and Malcolm Thomas (1988) are the only players on Philadelphia's roster who were not born in the 1990s.

Kirilenko has yet to report to the team since being traded to Philadelphia earlier this season, so Richardson is the oldest player on the team by a good margin.
