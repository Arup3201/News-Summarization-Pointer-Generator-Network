They are the bane of many office worker - colleagues who come in coughing and spluttering when they should really be in bed.

Now, a leading microbiologist has spoken out against the 'stiff upper lip brigade' - instructing them to stay at home - even when illness is in the early stages.

Dr Charles Gerba, a leading microbiologist, has warned that coming into work even at the start of feeling ill can wreak havoc around the office.

Staff at Cardiff council have been sacked for taking too many sick days, as the average rose to 10 a year  

If you are even starting to feel symptoms, this is when you're most likely to be contagious, he says.

And other experts are warning that going to work when you have symptoms can actually make you even more 
ill.

'We see a lot of worsening symptoms because people will just
 not stop and rest,' said Catherine
 Cummins, a health sciences assistant clinical professor at the 
University of California-Irvine School of Medicine.

She told WedMD: 'They want to go; they want to be able to do 
everything they normally do.

If you are healthy but others around you at work are sick, there are some measures you can take to protect yourself.

Dr Gerba suggests frequent hand washing, for 15 to 20 seconds each time, and then drying them with a clean paper towel.

This alone can reduce the spread of germs by nearly 80 per cent.

If there is no water around, use instant hand sanitiser if available.

Disinfectant wipes to clean surfaces have also been shown to reduce viruses by up to 62 per cent.

The Arizona scientists found that using
 tissues to wipe the face, hand sanitiser  and washing hands before lunch and after a big meeting 
resulted in an 80 per cent reduction across the board, for all three 
viruses, in their risk of infection.

'What they don't 
understand is that they're pushing themselves to the point where they're
 actually a lot sicker at the end of two to four days than they would 
have been if they had just taken that first day off and let their body 
fight the infection.'

And while taking cold and flu remedies can help ease symptoms, they can affect work quality by causing drowsiness.

'This
 is when you just get a fever and are starting to feel under the 
weather. And if you go to work in this state, any medication you take 
will interfere in how well you do your job,' added Cummins.

Earlier this year, scientists at the University of Arizona found it really is better to stay at home, such is the speed that germs 
spread around an office.

They discovered when even one person comes to work sick, more than half
 of the commonly touched surfaces in the office will become infected 
with the virus by lunchtime.

When someone comes to work sick, about 
half of the commonly touched surfaces in the office will become infected
 with the virus by lunchtime.

Some of the likeliest germ hotpots 
include telephones, desktops, tabletops, doorknobs, photocopier and lift
 buttons and the office fridge.

However
 the study also revealed that simple interventions, such as hand washing
 and the use of hand sanitiser or wipes, can drastically reduce 
employees' risk of infection.

Conducted
 in an office, the study included about 80 participants, some of whom 
received droplets on their hands at the start of a normal work day.

While
 most of those droplets were plain water, one person unknowingly 
received a droplet containing artificial viruses mimicking the cold, the
 flu and a stomach bug.

Other experts are warning that going to work when you have symptoms can actually make you even more ill - and it's better to take a day off at the start of an illness

Employees were instructed to go about 
their day as usual. After about four hours, researchers sampled commonly
 touched surfaces in the office, as well as employees' hands, and found 
that more than 50 per cent of surfaces and employees were infected with 
at least one of the viruses.

'We were actually quite surprised by
 how effectively everything spread,' said Kelly Reynolds, UA associate 
professor of public health at the university. 'I didn't expect to find 
it as much as I did.'

And that was in an office environment where people work primarily in isolated spaces, she added.

Touching
 surfaces - rather than coughing and sneezing over people - is how most 
germs in an office are spread, say the researchers. These viruses can last 
anywhere from a few hours to up to a month. 

Researchers
 swabbed surfaces and hands again at the end of the work day. By then, 
the cold and flu viruses, known for their short survival time, had 
dissipated, but the stomach virus had continued to spread, infecting up 
to 70 per cent of surfaces tested.

'We really felt that the hand 
was quicker than the sneeze in the spread of disease,' said Charles 
Gerba, co-principal investigator on the study.

Most people think
 it's coughing and sneezing that spreads germs, but the number of 
objects you touch is incredible, especially in this push-button 
generation. We push more buttons than any other generation in history. 
The key message is to stay at home when you're sick.'

The same 
study then was repeated with a 'Healthy Workplace Intervention' in 
place. Employees were provided free tissues, disinfecting wipes and a 
bottle of hand sanitizer and were instructed to wash their hands before 
eating lunch and after meeting with a large number of people.

With those simple interventions in place, risk of infection dropped below 10 per cent.
