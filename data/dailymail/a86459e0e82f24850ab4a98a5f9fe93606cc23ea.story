A French theatre dating back to the days of Napoleon III has been renamed for the man who paid to have it restored – Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan.

Sheikh Khalifa, who is the ruler of Abu Dhabi, stepped in to rescue the site in the famed Palace of Fontainebleau in Paris, bestowing five million euros (£4.1million) a year – and a name sure to make an impression on theatre-goers.

The 400-seat Imperial Theatre had fallen into disrepair after lying all but empty for 150 years.

Renamed: Paris's Fontainebleau theatre, which dates, back to the days of Napoleon III has been renamed for the man who paid to have it restored - Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who is the ruler of Abu Dhabi

Inspired by Queen Marie Antoinette’s 
theatre at Versailles, it was opened in 1857 by Emperor Napoleon III and
 hung with tapestries and a chandelier.

But it was only used a dozen times before Napoleon was deposed in 1870 
and was a wreck by 1920, when the huge chandelier crashed to the ground.

During
 the Second World War, it was used by the Nazis to  entertain officers 
during the occupation of France. They abandoned it in 1941 because it 
was unsafe.

After seven years of restoration work, the Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan Theatre is ready to host plays and concerts again.

Speaking
 at the re-opening ceremony the palace’s president, Jean-Francois 
Hebert, said: ‘The trump card is that it has survived in this state 
after 150 years.’

Sheikh Sultan bin Tahnoun Al Nahyan, head of Abu Dhabi’s culture board, also spoke.

Sheikh
 Khalifa has sponsored a number of arts projects, including the planned 
 Louvre Abu Dhabi, a foreign branch of the Paris museum.

New life: The theatre has been given a new life (and a somewhat complicated name) after the restoration
