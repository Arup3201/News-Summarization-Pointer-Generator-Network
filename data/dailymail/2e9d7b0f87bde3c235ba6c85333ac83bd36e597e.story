Into orbit: Music legend Sarah Brightman confirmed she will be a space tourist

Sarah Brightman once sang about losing her heart to a starship trooper.

Now she’s paying more than £30million to become one herself – or at least as near as it’s possible for an earthly tourist to get.

The former wife of composer Andrew Lloyd Weber has confirmed she will be travelling to the International Space Station with the Russian Space Agency.

Reports in the US said she had 
‘bumped’ an astronaut off the next flight after outbidding Nasa to 
secure her seat as the next space tourist.

The 52-year-old singer refused to say
how much she paid for her place aboard the Soyuz spacecraft, but said 
she was getting sponsorship.

A US TV station said she had paid $51million (around £31.8million) – the highest sum ever offered for a ticket.

Miss Brightman will begin training 
for the mission in 2014 after a 12-month world tour and will lift off 
later that year for two weeks orbiting Earth.

She said: ‘I am more excited about this than I have been about anything I have done.

‘Most of my life I have felt an 
incredible desire to take the journey to space that I have now begun. 
This is beyond my wildest dreams.'

She has already undergone physical 
and psychological tests in Moscow to prove she is fit enough for the 
challenge. ‘I was prodded and poked and a lot of blood was taken,’ she 
said.

One test involved being put in a 
centrifuge replicating the gravitational force she will face on 
returning to Earth. She was also obliged to sit on ‘a rotating chair 
that makes you sick’.

Miss Brightman, who is estimated to 
have a personal fortune of £30million, revealed her family had 
reservations about her becoming a cosmonaut.

She said: ‘I had to think about it 
very carefully and take my family into consideration. When I told my 
mother, it was very sweet. She shivered, but I told her the Soyuz has a 
very good record and then she was fine.’

The singer will complete her training in an intensive five-week period before blasting off.

With Nasa’s space shuttles now 
retired, Russian Soyuz spacecraft are the only vessels currently capable
of carrying people to the International Space Station. As a result, 
open seats available for tourists have been scarce in recent years.

The most recent tourist on a Soyuz 
was Canadian Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberte, who paid around 
£21.8million for his trip in 2009.

Brightman, whose 1978 single I Lost 
My Heart To A Starship Trooper reached number six in the UK charts, said
seeing fuzzy TV images of the first ‘bouncing’ human steps on the moon 
in 1969 when she was eight years old inspired her to dream about 
travelling to space.

‘It was something miraculous. For me,
it was an epiphany,’ she said. ‘It seemed so unrealistic and crazy at 
the time but I suddenly saw that it was possible.’

The singer made her name playing 
Christine in The Phantom Of The Opera, with the part written for her by 
Lloyd Webber, who she married in 1984. She has enjoyed a successful solo
career since her divorce in 1990.
