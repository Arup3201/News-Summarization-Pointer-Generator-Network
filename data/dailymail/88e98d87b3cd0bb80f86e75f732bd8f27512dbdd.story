Manchester United travel to America on Friday as the club prepare for this summer's tour of the US.

Following Louis van Gaal's first press conference, the Dutchman will be getting to know his squad over the next week ahead of United's friendly against LA Galaxy next Thursday.

Follow Sportsmail's coverage as Van Gaal's Red Devils prepare for the Stateside tour.

The French defender, who seems set for a move to Italian giants Juventus, is also missing from the squad.

Peculiarly, Nick Powell, whom some believe has a decent shout of making an impact at Old Trafford this season, has been left out too.

Anderson has been left out of Manchester United's squad for the tour of America after suffering a calf injury during pre-season training, according to the club's official website.

The midfielder, who spent part of last season on loan at Fiorentina, will remain at the club's training complex to continue his rehabilitation.

Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera have both been named in Van Gaal's 25-man squad and were snapped wearing Manchester United's club suits.

Wayne Rooney will be eager to impress his new boss... particularly in the absence of strike partner Robin van Persie who Van Gaal knows all about.

Goalkeepers: David De Gea, Anders Lindegaard, Ben Amos, Sam Johnstone.

Defenders: Rafael, Jonny Evans, Chris Smalling, Phil Jones, Luke Shaw, Tyler Blackett, Michael Keane, Reece James.

Midfielders: Ander Herrera, Tom Cleverley, Darren Fletcher, Ashley Young, Wilfried Zaha, Shinji Kagawa, Juan Mata, Antonio Valencia, Nani, Jesse Lingard.

Forwards: Danny Welbeck, Wayne Rooney, Will Keane.

While Louis van Gaal was being unveiled on Thursday, two Manchester United old boys were putting thoughts of Old Trafford behind them.

Rio Ferdinand, released by United at the end of the season, wrapped up his move to Queens Park Rangers by signing a 12-month contract.

And former United boss David Moyes was soaking up the sunshine as he watched the first round of The Open at Hoylake.

Michael Carrick damaged ligaments his ankle and will be out for 10 weeks, new Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal revealed on Thursday.

Sportsmail understands the 32-year-old midfielder suffered damage to a bone in his left ankle and underwent surgery on Thursday morning to establish the extent of the damage.

For the first time in 12 seasons, Rio Ferdinand will not be attending Manchester United's summer tour.

Having signed for the Red Devils from Leeds in 2002, the former England centre-back joined Harry Redknapp's QPR on a one-year deal on Thursday evening.

Manchester United aren't the only club preparing to go on tour this summer.

In total, Premier League sides will rack up over 175,000 air miles.

That's right, there will be around 120 members of the United team in America this week.

Between 32 and 39 players - minus the injured Michael Carrick - will travel with coaching staff, admin staff and directors.

MUTV are evidently keen to get behind the new regime and the new trailer which slams the Moyes era is a bold production given its setting on an in-house station.

But in an age where we criticise clubs for the propaganda-like offerings from their official websites and TV channels, MUTV should at least be applauded for refusing to ignore their disastrous last campaign.

We're not too sure David Moyes will agree with that sentiment, however.

The Louis van Gaal era at Manchester United looks to have started already as the diggers moved into the club’s Carrington training complex.

The Dutchman spoke to the media on Thursday for the first time since being appointed as Manchester United boss and described facilities as 'fantastic' but said something must be done about how windy it gets.

'The (training ground) needs some more intimacy and I have asked (for that) already,' Van Gaal explained.

Flight times for the tour were put back around ten days ago and so the club will now fly at 3pm rather than 12.30pm.

The squad are scheduled to take a light training session this morning as the side's England contingent make a return following World Cup duty.

The players must finish by 12pm in order to check-in at the airport at 1.

Rooney is looking forward to United's upcoming trip and has said on his Facebook page: 'Can't wait to get back to training today and then leave for our pre-season tour of America. Looking forward to seeing the lads and getting started!'

Thursday, July 24: LA Galaxy (Chevrolet FC Cup - Rose Bowl, Pasadena) 3.30am

Saturday, July 26: Roma (Guinness International Champions Cup - SA Field, Denver) 9.10pm

Wednesday, July 30: Inter Milan (Guinness International Champions Cup - FedExField, Washington) Midnight

Saturday, August 2: Real Madrid (Guinness International Champions Cup - Michigan Stadium, Ann Arbor) 9.06pm

Van Gaal is seriously racking up the air miles.

Just a few days after arriving in England having guided Holland to the World Cup semi-finals, the new United boss has had to pack his bags once more for the trip to America.

The Red Devils will be facing some world-class opposition over in the States - taking part in the Guinness International Champions Cup as well as the Chevrolet FC Cup.

Anderson, Bebe and Nani arrived for training but all three players face an uncertain future at the club.

Uncertainty hangs over the future over wideman Nani while Anderson and Bebe were both loaned out last season.

He started by talking about the honour of taking his first few steps as Manchester United manager alongside Sir Bobby Charlton. By the time Louis van Gaal was up and running on Thursday, however, it was clear he won’t need any assistance finding his own way in English football.

It will be Van Gaal’s way or nothing.

Having left Brazil early following England's disappointing elimination from the World Cup at the group stage, Wayne Rooney is back and ready for United's assault on the Premier League.

Sportsmail understands the squad will train this morning before taking a coach to Manchester airport this afternoon.

Van Gaal and his side will then travel Stateside at around 3pm.

The Red Devils are about to embark on their tour of the US with fans set to get a glimpse of new signings Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera.

Van Gaal was one of the first to arrive at United's Carrington training base on Friday morning.

However, while most of his players will arrive in flash sports cars, the Dutchman was pictured in the back of a new Vauxhall.

Nothing too flashy for the new manager having properly moved to the north west just days ago.

Good morning and welcome to Sportsmail's live coverage as Louis van Gaal prepares his new Manchester United side for the club's trip to the States.
