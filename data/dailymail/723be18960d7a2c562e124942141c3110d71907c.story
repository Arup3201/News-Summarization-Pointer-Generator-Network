The family of a 'brainwashed' British teenager who loved the X Factor and KFC today demanded to know why airport officials allowed her to fly on a school day when she  fled to Syria to join ISIS.

Yusra Hussein, 15, left home in September but instead of going to class went to Heathrow where she caught a flight to Turkey.

She boarded a plane with a 17-year-old British girl she met online and the two are now believed to be in Syria, and may have married jihadist fighters.

Speaking today her family called on the young girl to return home - and asked why she was allowed to fly.

Appeal: Sucdi Ali, left, the aunt of  Yusra Hussein, 15, right, has asked how she was able to flee Britain for Syria 

Sucdi Ali, Yusra's aunt, said on ITV's This Morning: 'How did she manage to proceed through an airport on a school day, on a school hour?

'She should be in lessons, rather than just getting on a flight and going to Turkey like she is going on holiday.

'Yusra, if you are watching this, we love you we miss you and your mum and dad needs you back home no matter what.

'Just come home to us. Just remember we love you and miss you.'

Yusra went missing in September and it is believed she fled to Syria to join Isis after she became radicalised online.

Ms Ali said: 'She is a typical teenager who watches the X Factor and loves KFC. But in September she just disappeared.

'The night before she he told her mum she was going on a school trip and said to tell dad not to pick her up and not to make her a packed lunch.

'She went to bed early at 8pm and woke up early morning, left on a coach at Bristol from 7am 

'She never said anything about going away. She was afraid of everything, would not go out in the dark and her father would pick her up from school, which is a ten minute walk from her home. Nothing to say that she is unhappy, or that she was angry about Syria or Gaza'.

Worried: Ms Sucdi and family spokesperson Anira Khokar fear the British teenager has been 'brainwashed'

Hunt: Police leave Yusra's home in Bristol, where she fled telling her parents she was off on a school trip

Since the girl from Stapleton, Bristol, has been missing, she has been in touch with friends on social media but has failed to contact her family.

She has said she is angry that her family are making public appeals for her to return. 

Yusra was able to meet another Somali schoolgirl Samya Dirie, 17, at Heathrow and board an aircraft to the Turkish capital Istanbul with her at midday.

The two teenagers are not thought to have met before and only knew each other from chatting online.

Police failed to stop a schoolgirl feared to be travelling to Syria from boarding a flight despite being told she had run away with her passport.

Three hours after Samya Dirie’s panicked parents alerted officers that she was missing, she was allowed to fly from Heathrow to Turkey with another teenage suspected would-be jihadist.

The two girls are believed to have met online and arranged to travel together to Syria, apparently intending to join Islamic State militants.

Samya, 17, appeared to be a dedicated A-Level student who loved her life in Britain and dreamed of becoming a lawyer, her distraught family said yesterday (Tue).

She has not contacted her parents since disappearing, but has told a cousin she is ‘somewhere far away’ and fears what the police will do to her if she returns to the UK.
