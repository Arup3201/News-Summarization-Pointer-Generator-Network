Nigel Tinsley had the 5cm brain tumour removed through his nose in an eight-hour operation

A grandfather diagnosed with a tumour in his brain had the 5cm growth removed through his nose. 

Nigel Tinsley first noticed something was wrong when his eyesight began to fail.

The 69-year-old visited his optician 
within a week of discovering the problem - but was told there was nothing wrong.

It was only after he was referred to hospital that tests revealed he had a tumour on the pituitary gland in his brain. 

This was pressing on his optic nerves, causing him to slowly lose his sight.

To his surprise, doctors said they would remove the growth by sucking it out through his nose.

The grandfather-of-five has now made a full recovery after the operation at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham last September.

Mr Tinsley, who lives with his wife Jenny in Tettenhall, in the West Midlands, said: 'My sight had got so bad that I lost my wife while shopping in Waitrose. I just couldn't see her at the end of the aisle.

'It came on really suddenly - I was practically blind and couldn't read a thing.

'I had gone from being able to read a car number plate from 25 yards - as you need to for the driving test - to not even being able to see the end of my garden.'

Left untreated for much longer, he would have gone blind, he says.

'My optician has always been very good but he couldn't find anything wrong with my eyes.'

But an MRI scan at New Cross Hospital revealed he had a pituitary tumour. This was pressing on the optic nerves, causing him to slowly lose his sight.

'Looking
 back, there had probably been other minor symptoms,' said Mr Tinsley. 'But I thought "I'm 
bound to get a little tired sometimes because I'm 69".'

The treatment, which uses an endoscope - a thin, flexible tube with a camera - meant he
 could return home within a week of the operation.

The neurosurgeon who carried out the 
operation, Alessandro Paluzzi, said tumours on the skull base were 
difficult to remove using conventional procedures.

He
 said: 'The operation is extremely invasive and requires a long stay in 
hospital with breathing and feeding tubes, and leaves visible scarring.

'It also carries a greater risk of brain damage.

'However,
 the endoscopic surgery allows the tumour to be removed via the nostrils
 without causing disfigurement or damage to the brain.'

The tumour is reached by working through one nostril and making a hole in the back of the nasal cavity into the bottom of the skull.

Through this hole, the surgeon can see the bottom of the pituitary gland and the tumour.

Cutting instruments, also mounted on flexible or telescopic arms, are used to remove the growth in pieces - leaving no scarring.

Mr Tinsley said: 'Although I initially felt groggy, I recovered quickly. By the end of the week I could read anything.

'I had my operation on the Saturday. It took eight hours, and I was pretty poorly for a couple of days.

'But on the Tuesday I woke up and looked out of the window, where I could see the clock tower at Birmingham University a quarter of a mile away. It was amazing.'

He is now fundraising to help the hospital's appeal to raise £250,000 for three brand new pieces of equipment, which will allow more patients to receive the same treatment he benefited from.
