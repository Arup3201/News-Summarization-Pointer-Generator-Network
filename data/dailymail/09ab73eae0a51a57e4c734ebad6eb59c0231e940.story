A Mississippi grandfather who woke up in a body bag as he was lifted on to an embalmer's table two weeks ago has died at home.

Walter Williams had mistakenly been declared dead after suffering from heart failure at a hospice on February 26.

But thanks to his unexpected recovery, the 78-year-old's family got to spend two more weeks with him before he passed away at home at 1am Thursday.

Second chance: Walter Williams was rushed to hospital last month after waking up in a body bag. The 78-year-old died on Thursday

'God gave us a little more time with him, and we're happy about that,' his daughter, Mary Williams, said.

Eddie Hester, his nephew who had been at the hospice when Mr Williams was zipped into a body bag, added: 'I think he's gone this time.'

The story of Mr Williams' recovery last month went viral, after staff at Porter and Sons Funeral 
Homes noticed the elderly man's leg moving as they prepared to embalm 
him.

The father-of-11, who has 15 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren, had been declared dead by a coroner when neither he or medical staff could find a pulse.

'After they got through checking him, the coroner, they pronounced him dead and put him in a plastic bag, zipped him up and took him, put him in the hearse and they left,' Mr Hester said.

He told 16 WAPT News: 'That was at 10:30pm, and at 2:30am, my cousin called me and said "Not yet" and I said "what do you mean not yet?" He said, "Daddy still here".'

Mr Williams' daughter, Martha Lewis, added: 'The mortician said something wasn't right. His leg started moving.'

The 78-year-old was rushed to hospital and then allowed to return home a few days later. Doctors believe a combination of medicine he had been given may have made it appear that his vital signs were unresponsive.

His family suggested that Mr Williams' pacemaker may have stopped working and then restarted.

Two weeks after his recovery, which the coroner described as a miracle, Mr Williams died at his home. The cause of death has not been released.
