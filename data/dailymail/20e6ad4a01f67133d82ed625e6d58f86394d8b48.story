Not keeping a low profile: Part of the conditions for disability filings meant that the individuals did not have full time jobs like Louis Hurtado clearly does, owning a karate center in Florida

A 60-year-old mixed-martial arts teacher was called 'one of the most flagrant' scammers in a  $400million pension-fraud scheme as he appeared in Manhattan court Monday for arraignment.

Retired Queens police officer Louis Hurtado collected $470,395.20 over 26 years, the most money over the longest period of time accoring to prosecutors.

Assistant District Attorney Christopher Santora said Hurtado was one of the worst abusers, posting videos of himself performing martial arts on YouTube and traveling on at least 18 flights between 2006 and 2013 all while claiming he was too depressed to leave his house, travel or work. 

Hurtado was extradited from his home 
of Pasco, Florida where he owns V.I.P Karate and lives in an upscale 
gated neighborhood called 'The Champions Club'.

While the 16 other defendants were 
processed in groups of three and four and released without bail, Hurtado
 was singled out and had to post $20,000 to walk.

A lead instructor at his martial arts school was shocked to hear of Hurtado's arrest, describing him as a 'very honest person'.

'It's having an effect on me as his student, as a man, as a father, as a human being. It's tremendously devastating at this moment,' instructor Joseph Mentor told ABC Action News.

Hurtado, who is called 'Shidoshi' at the school', boasts on the website that he is a sixth degree black belt who has served as a body guard for 'numerous dignitaries and celebrities' including Sean Connery, James Caan, Elliott Gould, Audrey Hepburn and Tony Orlando.

He says that his program has a positive influence on children and he takes pride in 'training and developing tomorrow's leaders, on Black Belt at a time!'

While claiming disability, Hurtado brazenly appeared in videos online performing martial arts. In one video, he fights off opponents with 'Danger Zone' blasting in the background. 

He also posted on his Facebook about looking forward to his 115 precinct reunion, which is scheduled to take place on a cruise this May. Following the charges, he may no longer be welcome to that reunion.

More than 100 first responders who 
claimed to have psychiatric conditions and medical disorders because of 
their work at Ground Zero were arrested last week for disability fraud.

Some of the retired police officers, 
firefighters and corrections officers stole money from the 9/11 
disability fund, while others like Hurtado had been stealing money from 
the pension fund for more than two decades.

The
 arrests come after the Manhattan District Attorney's office spent more 
than two years investigating the claims made by some NYPD officers and 
firemen who were part of the September 11 response and clean up efforts.

The officers submitted 
forms saying that they had varying disorders like PTSD, anxiety or 
depression- claims which were discovered to have falsified.

ABC 7 reports
 that many of the retired officers that had said that they were being 
treated for stress retained their gun licenses, which is not allowed if 
the holder has such a condition.

Another
 tip off was that in order to receive the benefits, the individuals had 
to be fully retired and while the majority of them had retired from the 
New York police and fire departments, many had taken up a second job.

Investigators
 used photos on Facebook as evidence that the men have taken up jobs 
ranging from martial arts instructors to helicopter pilots. 

Some photos directly contradicted specific parts of the disorders that the responding officers claimed to have.

Law on their side: Raymond Lavallee, 83, was one of those two lawyers who then helped process the legal papers which allowed the schemers to get on average between $30,000 and $50,000 per year- with a nice cut for each of the ringleaders

Responding to horror: More than a hundred first responders who helped at Ground Zero following the 2001 terrorist attack are being arrested over disability fraud after making false claims of PTSD and depression

Sending a message: Glenn Lieberman is pictured on a jet ski, clearly not as incapacitated as he claimed to be in his benefit filing

Proud: Shannon Tumminello, 42, now lives in Lee, Florida but was claiming disability insurance from the fund

Not so afraid of crowds now: Joseph Morrone, who said his post-9/11 fear of crowds kept him from working, collected $108,930 in payments and is seen here selling cannolis at the packed San Gennaro festival

The individuals' claims- whether they be 
depression or assertions that they felt unable to spend time with family
 and friends in social settings- have not been revealed- but the 
District Attorney's office released a set of photos that depict some of 
the men in question having a great time on jet skis or marlin fishing as
 examples of their fraudulent claims.

One instance came from an officer, 
whose name has not been released, that told authorities that his work 
after the September 11th attacks left him with a  debilitating fear of 
crowds. On Facebook, he was pictured selling canollis at the crowded San
 Gennaro festival in Little Italy.

The suspicion is that there were a 
handful of 'crooked' lawyers and doctors who worked with the responders 
in question and were fully aware of how to 'game the system'.

The four alleged 'ringleaders' were 
identified first, and it is clear that their positions within the NYPD 
and background in legal work helped them evade capture for years.

Moving up north: Unlike many of the fraudsters who retired to Florida, Rich Cosentino moved to New Hampshire, but that doesn't put him out of the scope of the Manhattan District Attorney

Active: Rich Cosentino collected a total of $207639 since May 2008

Participants
 would start out by contacting John Minerva, 61, a Detectives Endowment 
Association consultant, or Joseph Esposito, 64, a retired member of the 
NYPD.

Minerva or Esposito would then refer the 
fraudsters to one of two lawyers who were in on the scheme- Thomas Hale,
 89, and former FBI agent Raymond Lavallee, 83.

All four are charged with first and second degree grand larceny. The 9/11 disability claims are not the 
first that the four men have had a hand in, as ABC reports that they are
 believed to have been running disability scams since 1988.

'My client's involvement in this scheme was minimal at best... he maintains his innocence,' Minerva's lawyer Glenn Hardy told The New York Daily News.

The lawyers put the schemers in touch with two different doctors- but not after some coaching.

The district attorney laid out a series of different trigger phrases that would help justify an anxiety condition prescription.

They range from 'I nap on and off during the day' to 'my (family member) is always after me about my grooming'.

Not hurting too badly: John Famularo, 58, lives in Nassau, New York and his alleged disabilities- which have not been specifically disclosed- should have prevented him from motorcycling but he proudly posted this to Facebook

Throwback: Famularo had no qualms about posting this old picture of him in uniform online, and he was far from the only 'boy in blue' that was involved in the scheme

Other possible additions included the lamentation that they were 'healthy, active, productive' people but no longer.

'They're
 liable to say... spell the word "world," so you go "W-R-L-D." Then 
they're gonna say "Spell it backwards." You think about it, and you 
can't spell it backwards,"' court papers report that Esposito said in a recording.

All told, the fraudulent claims cost $24.5million in taxpayer-funded benefits.

'For years, federal taxpayers have unwittingly financed the lifestyles of the defendants charged today,' district attorney Cy Vance said in a statement which listed all of the 106 accused.

Busted: Mike Scialabba collected $232,443 from the fund but also broke the rules by working as a helicopter pilot- a job which would be extremely difficult should he actually have the condition he claimed to suffer from

'Many participants cynically manufactured claims of mental illness as a result of September 11th, dishonoring the first responders who did serve their City at the expense of their own health and safety. This alleged scam further depleted the already limited resources available for battling the real and complex conditions of PTSD and depression.'

The case is the biggest bust that was announced since the new Mayor, Bill de Blasio, and his team has been in office, making this the first time in his recent tenure that new police commissioner William Bratton has weighed in on the work of the DA's office.

'The retired members of the NYPD indicted in this case have disgraced all first responders who perished during the search and rescue efforts on September 11, 2001, and those who subsequently died from 9/11 related illness, by exploiting their involvements that tragic day for personal gain,' Bratton said in the statement.
