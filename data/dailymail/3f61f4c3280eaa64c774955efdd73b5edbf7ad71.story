Utah Utes' wide receiver Kaelin Clay broke down in tears and blamed himself for his team's defeat to the Oregon Ducks after committing one of the biggest gaffe's possible in American college football. 

Having collected a 78-yard pass, from quarterback Travis Wilson, Clay thought he had extended his side's lead with their second touchdown of the match as he in ran to 'score'.

However, the 22-year-old had inexplicably dropped the ball one-yard short of the line as he celebrated wildly with team-mates in front of the jubilant home supporters.

Sportsmail's graphic shows how the unusual sequence of events happened as Clay failed to score

The Utah supporters went wild as they thought Clay had extended their side's lead on Saturday night 

To make matters worse for Clay, Oregon linebacker Joe Walker seized upon the opportunity to scoop up the ball and race 99 yards in the other direction for the Ducks' first touchdown, tying the score at 7-7.

It sent the crowd into shock and felt like a waking nightmare for Clay who appeared to have given it his all - yet one clumsy move and his efforts were all for nothing. 

Clay slumped down on the bench and briefly pulled his black head band down over his eyes as the Utes and their fans were stunned silent. 

'My teammates had my back and everybody tried to pick me up and then I forgot about it for a while, but at the end of the game it came back to me, full circle,' Clay said afterwards.

The play covered 178 yards — 78 one way and 100 the other. If ever a play killed momentum, this was it.

The match referees gathered to discuss the unusual play before awarding the points to Oregon

After Oregon scored on one of the wildest plays imaginable it changed the game instantly, as they eventually beat Utah in a 51-27 victory.

'I know how important points are, so I take full responsibility,' Clay added with his voice breaking and tears in his eyes.

'That shifted the whole game. We could've gone up 14-0. I take the blame. I place it all on my shoulders. It's just one of those things where I got excited. I got carried away. There's nothing I can do about it now.'

After the match, the 22-year-old also took to Twitter to apologise and vent his frustration at his mistake: 'I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS GAME BY MY SELFISH ACTIONS...I'll take this one,' he tweeted.

Utah fans look on shellshocked as they can't believe what has happened in a crazy phase of play
