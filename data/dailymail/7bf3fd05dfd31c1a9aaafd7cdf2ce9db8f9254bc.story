Meet eight-month-old Hurley who was born a deaf dog.

But his hearing impairment has proved to be no barrier for this intelligent pooch, having learnt to respond to commands in sign language since February with the help of trainers like Adam Farrugia.

Sadly the friendly canine is in need of some TLC as he's been without a proper home since January, which is when his previous owner surrendered him to Australian animal welfare group RSPCA.

'So far he's learnt how to respond to sit, drop and walk,' the education and training officer said.

'The other dog at his previous home wasn't comfortable living together so his owner gave him away.

'After he was with us for a few weeks, we realised that that he wasn't responding to us and that's when we figured that he was deaf.'

But Hurley's case isn't an unusual one for the RSPCA as their Sydney shelter, located in Yagoona, sees an average of four deaf dogs come through each year.

The RSPCA receives about a dozen deaf dogs across its nine NSW shelters each year.

Mr Farrugia said feafness is a common trait among white dogs due to a lack pigment-producing cells in their inner ears

Mr Farrugia said the owner needs to have a clear understanding of a deaf dog's needs

'We teach each dog similar but varied simple hand signals as their understanding depends on their intelligence level,' Mr Farrugia said.

The 35-year-old said deafness is a common trait among dogs like Hurley as their white coat is linked to a genetic disorder which lacks pigment-producing cells in their inner ears.

Mr Farrugia said Hurley can be a great new addition to a family with an experienced dog owner.

'Hurley is an affectionate but he's a big boy so he should be raised in a calm environment with children over the age of 15,' he said.

'Some people may be turned off because of the additional challenge but once they have a clear understanding of the needs of a deaf dog then they'll be able to raise a normal loving pet.'
