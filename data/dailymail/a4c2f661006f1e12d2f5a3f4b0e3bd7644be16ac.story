A 62-year-old Pennsylvania woman discovered a python on her bathroom floor when she went to the toilet during the night.

Debbie LaMotte first thought the snake was a scarf lying on the floor 'because it had such a beautiful pattern', she told the The (Sharon) Herald.

But when she prodded it with her cane, the snake's head moved.

The incident happened about 4 a.m. Tuesday at her apartment in Riverview Manor in Sharon - about 60 miles northwest of Pittsburgh.

When Police arrived LaMotte wound up the snake on her 'old lady grabber' - a long-handled device that helps people pick up items without bending over.

The snake was able to be safely put into a bag and taken away. 

She believes the snake may have been a slither-away pet that squeezed under her front door. 

The reptile was identified as a ball python - which is usually found in Africa but is a popular breed for pets.

Adult ball pythons usually measure between 5 to 6 feet long. They roll up into a tight ball when they feel threatened.
