A teenager whose weight was ridiculed online after she shared images showing her in her prom dress has received an outpouring of support from her Tennessee community.

Kristen Layne, 18, had posted two images of her wearing the purple floor-length gown on a Facebook classifieds page called 'For Sale in Sumner County, TN' in the hopes of selling it.

'Selling my prom dress,' she wrote beneath the pictures. 'I don't really remember the size, but it's in the 20s. Selling for $350 great condition only wore once!'

But after sharing the images, users unleashed a tirade of insults 'just telling me I was fat and that I wasn't beautiful', she told WSMV.

Attack: Kristen Layne, pictured, shared images of herself in her prom dress to a Facebook page in an attempt to sell the dress - and received a barrage of insults about her weight from strangers

Proud: Layne, who politely told the commenters to stop, said the dress made her feel beautiful

'Like this girl wasn't even comfortable sayin wat size the dress was,' one male user wrote. 'Hell I bet it's a 29 cause she didn't wanna say 30.'

'Does it fit in a durago??' another asked.

Layne told WSMV that she was hurt by the comments but online, she responded politely, writing: 'Can you please stop with the comments? Sorry that I'm not pleasing to your eye.'

Hundreds of people 'liked' the post and many commended the young woman for the way she stood up for herself. 

But she wasn't the only one answering back to the hateful comments - as other users quickly jumped to her defense.

'You looked absolutely gorgeous,' one woman wrote, while another added: 'It's obvious this woman is beautiful, inside and out.'

Overwhelmed: Layne said she was grateful for all the support she had received since the comments appeared

The community and strangers have now donated more than $2,000 to a gofundme page that Layne set up to be able to afford a new dress for her senior prom. She had aimed to raise just $350. 

'You are beautiful!' one woman wrote on the fundraising page. 'Never let anyone tell you any different! They are unhappy people and taking their unhappiness out on everyone else!'

Layne became emotional as she expressed her appreciation for the support.

'I don't know how to say thank you to people and accept the compliments because it doesn't happen a lot,' she told the local channel.  

Layne, who said she feels like a princess in the dress, which she found out was actually a size 26, said she wants the new owner to feel beautiful too and hopes other girls recognize their worth.

'Don't let anyone break you down,' she said.
