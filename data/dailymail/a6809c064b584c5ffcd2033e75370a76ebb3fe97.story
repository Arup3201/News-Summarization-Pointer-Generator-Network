David Cameron was today accused of ‘wilful negligence’ for taking Andy Coulson into Number 10 as his chief spin doctor despite repeated warnings about his links to phone-hacking.

Labour leader Ed Miliband said Mr Cameron would go down in history as the first Prime Minister ‘who brought a criminal into the heart of Downing Street’.

During furious exchanges in the Commons, Mr Cameron insisted the Leveson inquiry had made no criticism of his conduct and dismissed Labour’s ‘cooked up conspiracy’ of a deal between the Tory party and Rupert Murdoch’s media empire.

David Cameron repeated his apology for hiring Andy Coulson as his spin doctor, but Ed Miliband accused him of ignoring repeated warnings against taking him into Downing Street

Coulson worked as director of communications for the Tory party and later the government from 2007 to 2011

After resigning from the newspaper in 2007, Coulson became director of communications for the Tory party before taking on the same role in Downing Street when the coalition was formed in 2010.

Coulson was yesterday found guilty of plotting to hack phones while he was editor of the tabloid newspaper.

At Prime Minister’s Questions, Mr Cameron repeated his apology for hiring Coulson, for which he took ‘full responsibility’.

‘I did so on the basis of assurances that I received but also the select committee received.

‘But I always said that if those assurances turned out to be wrong I would apologise fully and frankly to this House of Commons and I do so again today from this despatch box. I am sorry. This was the wrong decision.’

He said Coulson’s conviction showed that ‘no-one is above the law in our country’.

But Mr Miliband stepped up his attacks on Mr Cameron, claiming he ignored warnings from newspaper reports and even Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, not to allow Mr Coulson to work in the government.

Mr Miliband accused Mr Cameron of being ‘weak’ for ‘failing to stand up for doing the right thing’.

But Mr Cameron shot back: ‘I’ll tell you what is weak, attacking Murdoch, and then standing up with a copy of the Sun newspaper, only to apologise a few hours later.’

Mr Miliband was ridiculed last week after posing for a publicity photo holding a promotional copy of The Sun, but later faced criticism from Liverpool MPs and activists angered by the newspaper’s coverage of the Hillsborough disaster.

Commons Speaker John Bercow had to intervene several times amid loud heckling from both sides in the Commons. 

Mr Miliband accused the Mr Cameron of being 'weak' and claimed the charge against the Prime Minister 'is not one of ignorance it is wilful negligence'

Mr Cameron repeatedly turned to the report of the Leveson inquiry into media ethics to show that he had been cleared of behaving improperly 

The Prime Minister claimed Labour was refusing to accept the findings of the Leveson inquiry because they believed a 'cooked-up conspiracy between the Conservatives and News International'

Veteran Tory minister Ken Clarke today claimed David Cameron had been 'unwise' to speak out over the Andy Coulson verdict while the phone-hacking trial was still going on.

The remarks, which will infuriate the Prime Minister, came after he was rebuked by a top judge.

The PM apologised on Tuesday for employing Coulson, saying it had been the 'wrong decision'.

But Mr Justice Saunders said his intervention was 'unsatisfactory' and set a bad example to the media.

Today Mr Clarke said: 'It was unwise and they should have taken some legal advice first, but I doubt whether it ever crossed David’s mind.

'It would only have crossed mine because I have a historic background as a lawyer and there obviously wasn’t a lawyer sitting around when they decided.

'When they were being pressed, of course, by the public and the press to give comments on the news that had come out.'

But the Prime Minister's Official Spokesman today rejected Mr Clarke's claim and confirmed the PM had sought legal advice before commenting. The spokesman said: 'Yes he did seek the Attorney General's advice.'

Mr Miliband: ‘Today we know that for four years, the Prime Minister’s handpicked closest advisor was a criminal and brought disgrace to Downing Street.

‘We now also know that the Prime Minister wilfully ignore multiple warnings about him.’

He said that in July 2009 the Guardian published evidence of ‘phone hacking on an industrial scale while Andy Coulson was editor of the News of the World’.

In May 2010, the Deputy Prime Minister ‘warned him in person about his deep concerns about Andy Coulson’, Mr Miliband said.

In September 2010 the New York Times published a front page investigation ‘detailing Andy Coulson’s extensive knowledge of phone-hacking, including one former editor who said “I’ve been to dozens if not hundreds of meetings with Andy, where the subject came up”.’

He also claimed former Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O’Donnell raised concerns about the deicion to bring Mr Coulson into Downing Street

Mr Miliband said the failure to heed the warnings raised doubts about Mr Cameron’s character and judgement. ‘When it came to Andy Coulson he just didn’t want to know the evidence,’ he added.

But Mr Cameron said all of the issues raised about been examined in detail by the Leveson inquiry ordered in the wake of the hacking scandal, and did not criticise him.

‘Every single one of these issues was dealt with by the Leveson inquiry. The terms of reference of the Leveson Inquiry were agreed by [Miliband] and they included the extent to which there was failure to act on previous warnings about media misconduct.

‘That is what Leveson looked into, he looked into all of these questions about the warnings I was given and the response I gave, and he made no criticism of my conduct.

‘Now I know that he was disappointed by the Leveson Inquiry, but he called for it, it took place and he should heed what it said.’ 

Commons Speaker John Bercow had to intervene several times amid loud heckling from both sides

Mr Miliband also raised questions about the level of security vetting carried out on Mr Coulson when he joined the government.

‘Amidst all of those warnings the very least he should have done is insisted immediately on coming to office that Andy Coulson should have the highest level of security vetting, as his six predecessors over the previous 14 years have had. Why didn’t he insist on it?

‘We know the rule of this Prime Minister is the buck doesn’t stop here, and he blames the civil service.’

Mr Miliband went on: ‘There is now a very important question which the whole country will want an answer to about whether Sir Gus O’Donnell or senior civil servants raised concerns with him or his office about Andy Coulson.

‘The truth about this is the charge against the Prime Minister is not one of ignorance it is wilful negligence.

‘At the heart of this scandal are thousands of innocent victims of phone hacking he didn’t stand up for.

‘The Prime Minister will always be remembered as being the first ever occupant of his office who brought a criminal into the heart of Downing Street.’

Mr Cameron, pictured leaving Downing Street this morning, faced repeated questions about judgement

But Mr Cameron said the Leveson inquiry ‘looked directly at this issue’ and found that ‘the level of security was not the decision of either Mr Cameron or Mr Coulson, it was the decision of the civil service’.

He claimed Labour was ‘desperate’ not to talk about the state of the economy or unemployment, but Mr Miliband ‘can’t re-run an inquiry that has already taken place’.

‘What [Mr Miliband] is trying to do is go through all of the old questions, that were answered by the Leveson Inquiry, he didn’t like the answer because he wanted to try and prove some cooked-up conspiracy between the Conservatives and News International.

‘He cannot manage to do it because the Leveson inquiry can’t find it.

‘He brought up the issue of the warning form the Guardian; I totally disproved him using the evidence. He brought up the idea of direct vetting; I have totally disproved him by using the evidence.

‘He cannot bare the fact that an eight month inquiry that he hoped was going to pin the blame on me found that I had behaved correctly throughout.’
