A pastor has been caught on video describing how he punched a young member of his congregation because he wasn't taking God seriously and 'brought him to the Lord'.

The footage of Eric Dammann, the pastor of the Bible Baptist Church in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, shows him talking about a 'smart aleck' called Ben he met while working in Calgary.

In the clip initially posted on the church's website he describes how one day, outside youth group, the boy was 'not taking God serious [sic]'.

Message: The footage of Pastor Eric Dammann of the Bible Baptist Church in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, shows him talking about a kid from Calgary named Ben

'Smart aleck': He describes how one day, outside youth group, the boy was 'pushing his buttons ' and 'not taking God serious [sic]'

So the pastor then acted out how he walked over to Ben and hit him in the chest. 

Dammann then tells the congregation he 'led that man to the Lord right there' and justified his actions saying 'there's times that is needed'. 

He said: 'There was a young man who lived in Calgary and his name is Ben. I lived there for a few years.

'He was a real smart aleck . He was a smart kid as well which made it really dangerous.

'We were outside one day at youth group one day and he was pushing my buttons not trying to take the Lord serious.

'And I walked over to him and I went 'Bam' and punched him right in the chest.

'I crumpled the kid, I just crumpled him. I leaned over him and said: 'Ben, when are you going to stop playing games with God? I led that man to Lord right there. There's times that might be needed.'

Pastor Dammann told the DailyMail.com that is actions were 'inexcusable'

In a brief statement he said: 'I would like to say that I do not endorse child abuse or ever will. My actions were inexcusable.'

The clip appears to have been taken down from the church's site.
