A teenage girl with Down's Syndrome had her dream come true thanks to her fellow high school students when she was crowned prom queen.

Carolann Nunez, a Special Olympics gold medalist, had always wished for the honor at Americas High School in El Paso, Texas.

Her friends went into overdrive with her campaign - making posters, tweeting voters and reminding fellow students on Facebook. 

Dream come true: Carolann Nunez, who has Down's Syndrome, was crowned prom queen at her Texas school by fellow students

Her father Michael Nunez told ABC7: 'Carolann has dreamed of being prom queen for years and years. She's watched Disney movies with prom queens getting crowned.

Carolann bought a pink dress covered in sparkles for the special event last Saturday evening and took her father as her date.

After she received her crown and sash, the teenager had her winning dance with prom king Brian Contreras, to loud cheers from the crowd. She then ran to hug her father. 

Carolann told the TV station: 'My parents helped me make a dream come true.'

Prom king: Brian Contreras said Carolann was a worthy winner because she was so friendly to other students at Americas High School

Fellow students said she was the ideal candidate for prom queen because Carolann was always so friendly and chatty to everyone she met in the school halls.

Mr Nunez added: 'Thank you to the student body. Their 
caring and acceptance of Carolann has just been fantastic. All the 
thanks in the world goes out to them for making her dream come true.'
