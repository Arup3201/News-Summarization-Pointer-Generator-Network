These were the violent scenes unfolding in the West Bank settlement today - where Palestinian protesters clashed with Israeli security forces over the prospect of further Israeli development in the region.

Yesterday, Israel published tenders to build 283 homes in the Elkana settlement in the north-west of the area.

The move came just days after the country announced its biggest land grab on occupied Palestinian territory for three decades.

In one violent clash, which took place in the village of Kfar Qaddum today, near the West Bank's northern city of Nablus, a balaclava-clad man can be seen using a slingshot to hurl stones towards an Israeli military digger.

In another, near the village of Wadi Fukin, a protester carrying the Palestinian flag is pepper sprayed by an Israeli security officer.

News of Israel's plans to build 283 homes followed the announcement of its largest land grab on Palestinian-occupied territory since the 1980s.

The settlement it is expropriating is around 400 hectares - which it has designated as state land, as opposed to land privately owned by Palestinians.

The expansion plans have drawn widespread criticism, with the U.S. state department urging Israel to reverse its decision.  

The decision has also been condemned by senior Palestinian government figures and Israel's chief negotiator in the stalled peace process, justice minister, Tzipi Livni. 

Mr Livni told Israel Radio News: 'The decision was incorrect. It was a decision that weakens Israel and damages its security.' 

The UK government also criticised the move with foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, labeling it as 'particularly ill-judged'.
