A woman who walked out on her five children more than 2 years ago to be with a man she'd known only two weeks maintains that she's still a good mother. 

In a Friday episode of Dr. Phil, a woman identified as Akealia admitted that she'd left her family behind for a new man, but said that she didn't want to hurt her babies.

'I missed most of my childhood. I just wanted more,' she said. 'I did not want to say goodbye to my children. I couldn’t deal with the pain it was going to cause them and myself.'

A woman who walked out on her five children more than 2 years ago to be with a man she'd known only two weeks maintains that she's still a good mother.

The Huffington Post noted that she then added that far from wanting to be apart, her ex-boyfriend Jamie, who she'd left after 13 years together, was keeping them apart.  

'Jamie is holding my children hostage,' she says. 'I feel like I am still a very good mother. I would do anything for them. If my children needed me, I would be there for them.'

Jamie told Dr. Phil he disagreed.

'Akealia has completely abandoned her children,' he says. 'It is very clear she wants nothing to do with her own kids.'

The host told Akealia: 'People get divorces every day, but they don’t divorce their children. They divorce their spouses.'
