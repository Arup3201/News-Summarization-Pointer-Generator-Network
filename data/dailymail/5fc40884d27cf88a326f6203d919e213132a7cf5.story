Former Manchester United manager David Moyes will be announced as the new boss of La Liga side Real Sociedad on Sunday, according to reports in Spain.

Moyes. who was sacked by the Red Devils in April after less than a season in charge at Old Trafford, was given a tour of the Basque club earlier this week and held talks on Friday.

Spanish newspaper AS now claim that Moyes has decided to relaunch his managerial career with Sociedad but Sportsmail understands that he remains unsure about taking the job and is set to make a decision on Sunday.

Moyes' reign at Old Trafford lasted just 10 months as the Scotsman failed to get the best out of his players

Sociedad, where Wales manager Chris Coleman was once in charge, have turned to Moyes after a disastrous start to their La Liga campaign which has left them with just six points from 10 games.

But the potential at a club which gets regular gates of 24,000-plus and was in the Champions League a year ago might be enough to persuade Moyes he has found the right opportunity to start again.

He told Sportsmail recently: ‘I’d like to find a job, if I can, that gives me a chance of being successful.

‘I have always felt it could enhance me as a manager to go abroad, so that is a possibility.’
