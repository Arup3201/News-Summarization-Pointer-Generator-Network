Prince William's friend, Guy Pelly, appears at Hammersmith Magistrates Court where he is on trial accused of driving a motor vehicle when his alcohol level was above the limit

A close friend of Prince William refused to puff into a police breathalyser after he 'panicked'  knowing he was close to the drink drive limit, a court heard today.

Nightclub owner Guy Pelly was pulled over while driving his £90,000 Audi R8 GT V10 Coupe  through London’s Knightsbridge, in the early hours of May 28 last year, after visiting an exclusive club he owns.

At first the 32-year-old refused to give a sample at the roadside before being arrested and taken to Belgravia Police Station to be tested on a more complex machine.

At his trial, his defence team claimed radio waves from his iPhone may then have interfered with the station's intoxicometer - and that the machine may have even been faulty.

In the dock, Pelly, who recently married Holiday Inn heiress Lizzy Wilson at a ceremony attended by Princes William and Harry, claimed he had drunk two 'large' glasses of red wine with dinner hours before he was stopped and arrested.

He insisted to police at the time that he had drunk two beers although today said that he was unsure of what he told them at the time.

Wearing a navy suit, white shirt and navy tie, the aristocrat, whose mother Lady Carolyn Herbert was a close of Princess Diana, said: 'I planned to go to a nightclub I own to check on it and see that stuff was OK.

'I had two large glasses of red wine, I don’t remember what [kind] it was.'

Mr Pelly said he opened a bottle to himself on the evening of May 27.

He then stopped drinking at around 11pm, with wine left in the bottle, but he could not remember how much, the court heard.

He continued: 'I then got in my car and drove to the bar I own. I was there talking to staff, checking the customers are ok, I was in the back office, probably were my staff are, spoke to the staff there, that kind of stuff.'

He denied that he had had any more to drink at the nightclub before climbing back in to his car shortly before 1am.

He was pulled over just before 1.10am by police who claimed he had 'accelerated quickly' in his luxury car.

Pelly said: 'I noticed the police when they put their lights on and their sirens, and then they obviously wanted me to pull over so I pulled over to the side of the road.'

When asked why he refused to give a sample he said: 'I knew that I had drunk alcohol that night, that I had drunk near to what the limit was, so I was anxious.

'In a way I panicked a little bit.'

Pelly was arrested and taken to Belgravia Police station after refusing to give a sample.

An expert 
witness for the defence told Hammersmith Magistrates Court that the US 
made intoximeter was behaving irregularly while Pelly was tested.

Professor
 Hugh Makin, an expert witness for the defence, called into question the
 reliability of the breathalyser used at Belgravia Police Station to 
record Pelly's alcohol levels.

He
 claimed that there was an 'anomalous' pause of 125 seconds between the 
machine recording a baseline reading of zero and the device's switch 
being activated and ready to use.

Prof Makin added that the breathalyser used by officers may have also had an out of date fuel cell, rendering it defective.

Quizzed on the machine's readings of Pelly's breath at 52 microgrammes in 100 millilitres, Prof Makin said: 'If something happens with no satisfactory explanation, such as the 125 second delay, I can't use the machine, I can't rely on the output'.

But prosecutor Stuart Sampson said: 'There is no evidence that something may take 125 seconds, it does not mean the machine was defective'.

Prof Makin replied: 'I don't trust a machine that is anomalous. I can't say it was defective but if I used that argument I'm potentially giving my colleagues a defective answer'.

Later, a software expert told the court that signals from the radios worn by officers in the custody area may have interfered with Pelly's breathalyser reading.

Dr Peter Thrift said radio waves from Pelly's iPhone may have also affected the machine.

'Radio waves could mean the message between the machine and the reading is corrupted', Dr Thrift added.

'I would query the reading. I can't conclude at all and say it's reliable or unreliable.

'The fact is the reading should not have been done where police radios were, it should have been redone'.

But Dr Thrift admitted that he is untrained with the intoximeter device used to record Pelly's breath and there was 'no evidence the machine was interfered with'.

Mr Sampson said Pelly's evidence that he only drunk two glasses of wine was 'not credible'.

'He says he drunk two large glasses of house red wine - which is an interesting turn of phrase when one is drinking at home.

'He told officers he drank two pints of beer as he said in his police statement which he signed.

'If Mr Pelly is correct then for an hour and a half or so before he was arrested he was in his car.

'He then went to his bar. The Crown say it is not credible he did not have a drink there'.

Pelly, 
who ran celebrity hotspots Mahiki and Whisky Mist in the past, also 
organised Prince William’s stag party in Devon three years ago.

His 
grandmother, Monica, was a member of the Tate & Lyle sugar dynasty 
and his friendship with Harry stems from their participation in the Duke
 of Beaufort’s Hunt.

District Judge John Zani will give his judgement on the case on a date to be fixed.

Pelly, of Pimlico, southwest London, denies driving a motor vehicle when his alcohol level was above the limit.

The trial continues.
