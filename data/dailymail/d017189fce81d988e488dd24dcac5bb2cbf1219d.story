The woman featured in a photograph that shocked the world last year - that shows her giving birth on the lawn of a medical clinic after she was refused treatment by health officials - has made a full recovery and is in perfect health, as is her five-month-old son, Sabino.

Additionally, the attention her shocking photo received has inspired women's rights activists across the globe to end what they call a pattern of poor 
indigenous Mexican women being turned away from hospitals while in 
labor, forcing them to give birth on lawns, patios or parking lots.

The shocking image, taken in October by a passerby,
 shows 29-year-old Irma Lopez , who is of Mazatec ethnicity, squatting 
after giving birth, her face contorted in pain and her tiny newborn son 
still bound by the umbilical cord and lying on the ground.

At the time the photo was taken, Lopez was sitting on a patch of grass outside a medical center that had refused to treat her.

On Thursday, women's rights advocates sought international help to fix the troublesome pattern of women being turned away from medical clinics.

Activists working in villages in southern Mexico say they have documented at least 20 recent cases of women giving birth outside hospitals whose staff claimed there was no room. Photos and video of some incidents posted on social media sites have prompted outrage in Mexico and around the world.

Mexican health officials have said the cases are isolated and unavoidable due to overcrowding and limited resources at some rural health centers. But women's advocates appealed to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights on Thursday, saying they believe there is a systemic problem of prejudice and callousness toward indigenous women in the Mexican public health system.

'These are not isolated cases. We 
have a pattern. We are not talking about one woman. There are many and 
nothing is being done to solve the problem,' said Regina Tames, director
 of the Reproductive Choice Information Group, a non-governmental 
organization based in Mexico City.

Pablo
 Kuri Morales, deputy health secretary for preventive care, said most of
 the births in Mexico's health system occur without problems but he 
acknowledged that hundreds of women here still die every year during or 
immediately after they give birth, giving the country a maternal death 
rate more than three times that in the U.S.

This
 is something the government of Mexico is worried about. Our stand now 
is to reject, disapprove and fight with all our strength any form of 
violence against women,' Kuri Morales said.

Many of these problems were ignored until the photo of Lopez was shared across the world - as well as across Mexico.

The
 picture upset many Mexicans when it was widely shared on Twitter and 
Facebook and shown on the front pages of some national dailies.

News
 about the outdoor birth prompted two other women to go public with 
their own harrowing tales of having their babies born outside the same 
center. Less than a week later, authorities fired the director of 
another hospital after a video showing a woman giving birth in a waiting
 room was posted on YouTube. Television news channels in Oaxaca state 
showed a woman having a baby in the dark courtyard outside the General 
Hospital of Huajuapan de Leon. In another case, an 18-year-old 
indigenous woman gave birth in the bathroom of a shelter next to a 
hospital after allegedly being refused medical care.

'This
 probably has been going on for a while,' said Tames. 'What's new is 
that people are outraged and want to do something about it.'

Earlier
 this month, President Enrique Pena Nieto urged hospitals not to refuse 
care to women in labor. Also, Oaxaca Gov. Gabino Cue recently announced a
 $550,000 investment to set up 50 new delivery rooms across the state.

But
 just this week, local media reported the case of a woman feeling 
contractions who had been sent away by a hospital and was only 
re-admitted after photographers began arriving.

None
 of the women or babies have died or suffered from major health 
problems, but Tames said authorities shouldn't wait for a death before 
adding more resources to understaffed rural clinics and hospitals.

Most
 of the cases that have gone public have occurred in Oaxaca. The largely
 rural southern state is among Mexico's poorest and suffers from high 
rates of obstetrical problems including preeclampsia, a condition that 
causes high blood pressure in women during pregnancy that can lead to 
kidney or liver failure.

A
 handful of similar cases have been reported in Puebla and Chiapas, also
 states with large indigenous populations and high rates of obstetrical 
problems and maternal deaths.

The
 human rights commission will study the cases heard Thursday and can 
send resolutions that are non-binding based on what it finds.

Although
 authorities fired the director of the first health center to draw 
attention to the problem, the Oaxaca state medical regulatory committee 
weeks later ruled that Irma Lopez's case was not the result of 
negligence and called the birth an unforeseeable event.

Lopez hopes the attention her case has brought to the state will help lead to better care for indigenous pregnant women.

'I hope that we find the support in the end. We are peasants and housewives.'
