After three previous failures, one of which resulted in a sunken boat and another that sprang a leak and left him drifting on a life raft for two weeks, Victor Mooney finally succeeded in crossing the Atlantic Ocean in a rowboat.

Mooney, 48, from Queens, New York, completed the challenge of approximately 3,000 miles in 128 days. He arrived to the Dutch Caribbean island of St. Maarten on Friday, and spent Saturday recovering from the ordeal, during which lost 80 pounds.

The trip was fueled by his desire to bring attention to the need for HIV testing and to honor a brother who died of AIDS in 1983.

'Not everyone has to row across the Atlantic. You can wear a red ribbon,' said Mooney. 'We all have a responsibility to do something.'

On February 19, Mooney left the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa in high spirits. But those faded as big waves and violent currents began to toss his 24-foot  boat around, alarming nearby boaters who radioed him.

'It was a tanker who said, "Do you know where you're at? Are you OK? Are you in your right mind?"' Mooney recalled.

He paused, and the devout Roman Catholic, who had placed crucifixes all over his boat, reminded himself to be still.

The weather began to improve, and Mooney also received help from an oceanographer and meteorologist, among those he chatted with by radio while crossing the ocean, saying he never felt alone.

The African-American recalled that his journey took the path of the trans-Atlantic slave trade.

"I asked my ancestors also for help to push me along," he said.

Mooney settled into a routine, awaking at 4am, then rowing for about an hour at a time and taking 30-minute breaks until 7pm. But the ocean remained rough for most of the journey, often erasing his progress.

'Sometimes you can row 10 miles, and then you wake up and you're 15 miles behind,' Mooney said. 'You get those days, and you're like, "Oh, man."'

He would devour several portions of freeze-dried food in one sitting and eventually ran out. He resorted to fishing until his tackle line broke, so he began to scoop fish up with nets or rely on flying fish jumping into his boat.

Then a shark attacked his boat and punctured it.

'I can remember like it was yesterday,' Mooney said. 'They circle your boat. They go around, they go under, they go around.'

He felt the hit and scrambled to repair the damage while the shark chased fish milling underneath the barnacles attached to his boat. He reminded himself to be still again and prayed, thinking about his wife and other supporters.

'Sometimes just putting on deodorant, smelling that fresh deodorant was encouraging, inspirational,' he said.

As he neared St. Maarten, he had a final conversation with a nearby tanker.

'He said, "Mooney, I have a big ship, do you need a rescue?"' he recalled. 'I said, "No, I don't need a rescue, I want a burger. Do you have a burger for me?"'

Medical officials have not yet allowed Mooney to eat that burger, feeding him instead small portions of oatmeal and light sandwiches as he recovers.

'I haven't weighed 140 pounds since 6th, 7th grade,' he said with a laugh.

In St. Maarten, he plans to eat well and replenish his energy with help from doctors and supporters, including a government team from Anguilla - his intended destination - who visited him on Saturday.

Despite the completion of a monumental crossing of the Atlantic Ocean, Mooney's journey is not complete.

As part of the Goree Challenge, Mooney plans to continue his trip after he regains his strength, rowing to the British Virgin Islands and then another 1,800-plus miles to New York and eventually home to Queens, where he runs a nonprofit South Africa arts organization.

The journey is one that he said he never plans to do again, noting how his wife was hesitant of him trying the trip for a fourth time.

'"I'm going to give you all the support you need, but this is it. We have to close the book on this one,"' Mooney recalled her telling him.

Mooney's first attempt in 2006 resulted in his boat springing a leak and sinking off of the coast of Senegal, in Africa.

His second attempt in 2009 came to a halt after his boat lost its freshwater system. His last prior attempt in 2011 ended when his boat sprang a leak and left him drifting on a life raft for two weeks, before being .

As part of his mission of awareness, Mooney urged people to get tested for HIV and to keep fighting to find a cure for AIDS.

He recalled an audience that supporters arranged for him with Pope John Paul II in the early 2000s.

'When John Paul gave me his blessings on World Aids Day and said, "Row," that always stayed in my mind,' he said.
