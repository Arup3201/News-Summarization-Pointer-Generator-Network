Police in Massachusetts undertook a daring rescue Sunday afternoon after receiving a frantic 911 call about a dog trapped in the icy Charles River.

Wellesley rescuers tracked the panicked owner's cell phone GPS data to an isolated stretch of river in the Elm Bank Reservation.

There they found a golden retriever named Crosby swimming for her life, stuck 40 yards from shore in the frigid water.

The cell phone data 'was absolutely critical in directing first responders to the correct area,' according to a Wellesly Police release.

Five-year-old Crosby was stuck in a tiny circle of broken ice, unable to paddle to shore after unseasonably warm temperatures had thinned the previously solid ice over the weekend.

Wellesley firefighter Dave Papazian jumped into action by donning a cold water survival suit and heading straight through the dangerously cold water and ice toward the ailing canine.

The rescue: Wellesley firefighter Dave Papazian (pictured) donned a cold water survival suit and dove right into the frigid Charles River. The 5-year-old golden retriever, a female named Crosby, had fallen through the ice after unseasonably warm temperatures thinned it over the weekend

Team effort: Papazian was joined in the water by Lieutenant Paul Delaney, who helped pull shocked Crosby from the water with the help of ropes and rescuers on shore

Rescuers looked as soaked and exhausted as Crosby as they finally got the drenched dog onto solid footing

Wellesley Fire Lieutenant Paul Delaney leaped into the action as well and dramatic footage shows him and Papazian bravely towing Crosby back to shore with the help of rescuers pulling with ropes on land.

Police said Crosby was in remarkably good shape when she got to land and footage shows her looking grateful as firefighters dried her off.

Still cold, damp and shaken, Crosby was reunited with her owner a short time later.

Crosby was plucked from the river cold and unhappy but in good shape considering her close brush with death

Warming up: Rescuers quickly wrapped Crosby in a towel and dried her off before reuniting her with her grateful owner shortly thereafter
